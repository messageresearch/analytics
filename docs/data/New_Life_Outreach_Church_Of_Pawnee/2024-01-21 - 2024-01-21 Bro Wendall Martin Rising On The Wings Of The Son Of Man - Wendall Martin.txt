are in an exodus for the spirit of Exodus is what we have been baptized into good evening it's good to see everyone here tonight in the house of the Lord and umen looks like we've got us some weather uh coming on and and so some uh especially those that have been uh that that have to travel a little bit they've they've decided to stay home and uh which is or to go home and uh which is probably pretty wise I I hear we could be getting a little bit uh toward the end of the the evening time I I think we'll have time for church and uh but later on this evening I I think it's going to start we have the possibility of course it's already freezing out and so uh um so we're we just want to keep praying for brother uh Steve and sister Karen as they are traveling and uh that the Lord will be with them amen well praise the Lord I trust everyone had had good lunch today and and um got all fat and Sassy you know um uh you get you know we we sure we sure enjoy we sure enjoy those those times at the fellowship hall and um uh but today we gave those ladies a break and we say God bless them love you all with all of our hearts if you have your Bibles we can look here in the Book of Genesis the 18th chapter and um we um are are going to just sort of continue our thoughts on the son of man and um um I you know uh the these these teachings that we have uh been doing we you know when you can't make it I I um I I I trust that you uh go back and listen online because I believe the spirit of the Lord is is is dealing in certain areas and and if it's God's if it's my responsibility to preach it it's your responsibility to listen and so every one of us we don't want to be uh we we need you need to hear every message that comes across this pulpit and so even when we can't make it um amen I know there's a lot of them out there but if if the Lord has placed you here then I think it's a good it's a good thing for us to hear the word that the Lord is is teaching to our church because the Lord is doing something um he works he he he works his his his spirit in in in veins as us preachers know amen the Lord just seem seems to work and and we all start feeling that same way and it just it's just the way the Lord works and so um I want to read we're going to to look here in the 18th chapter now this is dealing with the the Apostle or or Abraham and this is the fourth stage of Abraham's life now the 12th chapter was justification amen the then we skip a couple chapters the 15th chapter is sanctification you skip another couple chapters 17th chapter is is elshadai the almighty God this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming in but then real close to the 17th chapter we come into the 18th chapter and that's that fourth stage this is the stage of the Bride this is where the son of man comes to visit this is what Jesus is saying as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man this is the revealing right here and here is in it's in Genesis 18 And1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground and said my Lord now he man if he didn't have the correct revelation of who God was if he hadn't gone through the process of justification sanctification baptism uh of the Holy Ghost the types amen he he he did not come and say Lords there were three he said Lord he was expecting my Lord if I now if now I find fa have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and watch wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and he said so do as thou has said and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of find flour or meal knead it and make cakes on the her and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a good a young man and hastened it hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat now this is God appearing in flesh form this is the son of man this is God in a body this is Abraham feeding God Amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love and your blessings thank you for giving us rest and keeping your hands upon us Lord you see those Lord who are who are traveling and Lord I I pray that you'll keep them safe and and secured on the roads Lord Lord I I pray that you would be with our friend as we have have we have talked about brother Ron Spencer and yes whom we love so much and what a blessing he is Lord to the Bride of Jesus Christ and I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would be with him and in this battle that he's facing you're very aware of it Lord but God we're going to pull our swords out of the sheath and we're going to we're going to fight in the spirit realm and defeat the devil lord I'm asking that you would let him rest while we are bombarding those spirits that would come against his mind and his body I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would be upon this bride and that you would be with brother Ron and his wife and oh God lord ask that you'd be with uh the elders tonight Lord is there a lot are missing and I pray that you'll be with them Lord here we stand tonight to teach your word I pray Lord that you would help us that you would speak to our hearts Lord as we humble ourselves before you and rely upon you oh Lord Jesus we love you we're so thankful for what you're doing today in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated now we just read where God appeared to him and he ate it then the 10th versary actually if we were just to the ninth verse and they said where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said this is God I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo s Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Sarah now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed with it in herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of shity BR bear a child which am old is anything too hard for God to the Lord as at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou D laugh and so we want to minister here this morning or this evening on a I always say morning at night and then uh night in the morning amen whatever it is this evening I want to title this the rising on the wings of the son of man amen the position of the elect is an incredible position it's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I I can't think of anything greater there's not a greater age for sure now as we as we discussed for a moment there at at the very end of the service this morning and how that nature declares the the plan of God so beautifully you can you you God's expressed through nature you know he the son expresses the death burial and Resurrection the wheat plant shows the four stages of the church the nature amen we can see the chickens and the Hawks and the Eagles amen by the moon we can see the brides uh position in Christ's absence and and so we can see a lot of things and then brother brandham used the modern happenings to declare the spiritual world and and he he he says in the countdown he says but modern happenings is a forerunner of spiritual happenings now remember modern happenings are forerunners of the spiritual the natural as spiritual each happening accompany the other and only improved uh over for the other he says uh he says all the all the natural things are types of the spiritual he says now H how is that he says take take for One Transportation he says for the transportation was by the horse the next it was by automobile then science Builds an airplane but you see the first was one horsepower the car was maybe 20 horsepower the airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower see what it is it's just as we come on with the horse then the automobile was made the next thing was an airplane we just keep achieving on higher and higher going greater and greater this is the achievement of science this is the Forerunner this is a forerunner of spiritual things that has happened of God by his Spirit has been in his promised word and so when we when we look at this Amen brother bradam is is is showing how that we've gone from the horse and buggy and now here we are in in in this in this great rocket age amen and he and and it is incredible how civilization has been here for 6,000 years and amen and they rode the horse and buggy uh for for for nearly all those years and am man and they farmed and raised cattle there were no cars there were no trains there was no planes there were no space shuttles there were no Rockets there were amen this all started at the end of the 19th century Amen in the late 1800s when the automobile was first invented and then we can see the explosion of science I believe it was uh 1886 when the first driveable car uh um amen was was at first come in and of course amen it wouldn't it it wouldn't the people wouldn't really drive them until uh the you know 1908 and and and when when Ford began to mass-produce the Model T and thus replacing the the horsedrawn carriages amen 1909 here comes the Wright brothers and they are they and they they they built the first two seater in in uh um uh air you know seat aircraft in 1909 amen now they had been working on it in the early night and earlier than that but this was the first time that that that any uh uh passengers could ride on that and then of course we we know that in 1961 rocket propelled uh the first human into space and and and we can see how quickly things changed amen and it was right about the time when a prophet was going to be on the earth and the prophet was was going to not be a an intellectual giant this was going to be be a a man that didn't go to school he was going to be a man that's that's that that doesn't have the Seminary training amen but yet God was going to expect this man to share the depth of his word to the Common People amen because the depths of God's word the common people were going to have to have in order to make the Rapture amen and so God uh uh so brother brandham used he he used Hypes and shadows he he seen God in the nature and he seen and and and so God Amen provided lots of material for brother Bram as he as as he looked at the nature and he saw the trees and he saw the moon and he saw the stars and and and he saw amen the wheat plant and and when Brother bradam begin to notice amen it's incredible how when the seventh angel comes on the Earth all of a sudden amen about that same time here comes science just really uh uh coming in and and and and of course Daniel was told there in in Daniel 12:4 Amen it says that many shall run to and fro at the end amen he says but thou old Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased amen and so we can see amen that that God had had begin to to allow things to be done the the the anointing was upon the Earth to declare what God was doing in the spiritual realm we went from horse and then to car and then to plane and then to Rocket Amen brother brandham would say he says one day there was a horse and buggy and then we got the Automobiles and that's still horsepower but more of it in the automob moile it was an improvement of the horsepower and certainly we got the automobile it was an advantage over the horse and buggy and then we rode the horse and buggy and and then we took the automobile and then after the automobile the right Brothers come along and made an airplane still horse power but it's an improvement one accompanies the other one happening accompanies amen or types the the other happenings all the time now don't fail to get this open up ears heart and everything now and listen close when anything happens on the earth it is a warning to us that something is fixing to happen from Heaven what a what man does on Earth by his achievement is something that God is going to do by his achievement to the church in to his church now we look and and we can see the horse and buggy the automobile the airplane God is being able in the spiritual line to achieve from justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost now see it's a type Shadow achievement of what God has been able to do he says now remember God by Luther with the holy ghost power was able to achieve by Luther to the church justification and when the church got justification out of out of Roman Creeds and began to get life and begin to move through justification God was able to do it through his achievement to get one man to stand still long enough that he could project himself through and get his message out to the people all right the next achievement God was able to do by John Wesley to stand still enough to get away from the Lutheran Creeds where it had got to to preach sanctification then the church come from the horse and buggy to the automobile it's got more life and started running a little it it got got to go a little faster then and then there come and ausa Street where they left the ground and HIIT the air through the baptism of the Holy Ghost God through the church from an Earthbound Creed uh God took the church from an Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in the air just as the airplane come in the Holy Ghost come in behind it see that's right justification horse and buggy sanctification automobile baptism of the Holy Ghost it took off the ground got her feet off the ground flying around in the Heavenly places in the in the heavenlies with Heavenly gifts speaking in tongues Divine Healing amen and and and so you you can see what God is doing God is showing the bride is not going to get less the bride is going to come greater the bride doesn't go up in Pentecost 1906 and then fall to the ground no no no no no no no no no sir this last stage is the Great greatest stage and I'm wanting to show you tonight through some quotes and I am going to give you quite a few quotes if you want to to to take a few notes amen uh uh and I know this is Sunday night so I I I'll try to monitor how much I do but but I want to show you that God's plan when we say the son of man is not directly tied uh uh just to brother brandham but it is this last day AG of the church now now brother bradam would go on and and he he would say now the pillar of fire moved down and they come to zusa Street here in California and and then what did it do it represented the airplane days man was Able by the right Brothers to achieve an airplane that could fly immediately uh for for running that the zusa street fell and man took to the air and the supernatural to the unknown he spoke with tongues he done unknown things that was foreign to the church because he took off from the ground he he he he he left into the air and what did it immediately after the airplanes come on he took to the air God showed by the airplanes that his church was arising he showed by the Natural Things what's happening in the spiritual amen now he goes on down and he says now he he says John Wesley found sanctification now he never condemned justif ification he only added more power when the Pentecostals found the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the restoration of the gifts they never denied sanctification or justification they just got more power praise God he went up because he found more power amen now uh he says now from isusa the the Plaines took off then the great Revival swept amen the unknown places and the and and and unknown tongues and the gifts and and those kinds of things but then he says but but we've got but now we're in the astronaut age and in that astronaut age we're free you don't have to come back down you don't have to amen you you you get in that capsule and you just leave the the the gravity of Earth behind you're free amen there's no gravity there can you say amen and so we're not going to go uh uh uh through any more of those quotes but now I want us to just stop and look because he's now he has talked about man the three stages astronaut being the fourth amen he goes on now and he and he begins to talk about the stages of Abraham's life and as I said while ago Genesis 12 Justified right Genesis 15 Sanctified Genesis 17 baptism Genesis 18 the placing now I'm going to read this to you amen and and um uh I hope you get a blessing out of some of this because we have been teaching on it for a few Services now and I I I just like I I I I I listen I I think that it's so important to catch what brother brandham is trying to get to the church amen this this this appearing of the son of man affected Abraham and Sarah very much so amen it changed their lives they've been waiting on this promise and it only come from the name change after the name had changed after God had changed Abraham's name changed Sarah's name then they could bring on and I'm here to tell you we've had a name change amen we're not the Pentecostal L ofans we are the the the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now brother Brenham would say he says now what did he do made the Covenant with Abra Abraham say it with me Abraham and his seed what is the Seed of Abraham born again man and woman that's filled with the Holy Ghost oh now brother Brandon all right we'll see if he kept his promise Abraham in Genesis 12 was justified called out by justification and believed God's word is that right so was the church in Martin Luther is that right Genesis 15 uh the 15th chapter he was separated when he complet obeyed confirmed the Covenant to him by the blood Hebrews 13:12 and and 13 Jesus suffered without the gate that he might sanctify the people with his own blood is that right what did he send a message to the earth a messenger who was it in the Philadelphian age John Wesley preaching sanctification and that's when he confirmed it and separated them from sin and he believed through sanctification Genesis 12 he confirmed the blood the Covenant by Blood spilling the blood of a ram and so forth on the 15th chapter SEC and Sanctified the church now the 17th chapter he took the Holy Spirit he gave the Holy Spirit notice I El Shai now remember he's going to receive something in him amen from God now he's going to has strength like the Baby draws the the mother's own strength from the body of the uh like the uh like the baby draw the mother's own strength from the body of the mother through nursing the church has was given the holy ghost drawing the strength of the spirit into them nursing it back he gave the church the Holy Ghost the strength Giver his own strength God give God giving an outlet to his weak child that's confessed his faith and to give him strength for something he's ready to do something for him now justification Abraham justification Genesis 12 Martin Luther see of Abraham sanctification 15 confirmation of the uh uh Genesis 15 confirmation of the Covenant amen John Wesley sanctification Abraham had an outlet to to draw from his weak condition strength God's Own Strength do you see it now how many how many sees it say Amen do you see it here in our in in our building here tonight God's Own Strength nurse through promise he give it to the Pentecostals the holy ghost drawing God's own life right out into them he he he did it in the natural there he's doing it in the spiritual here Abraham's seed Abraham and his seed after him you get what I mean now now remember the church is still advancing now also in in the 18th chapter listen you may disagree with this brother now you will think Martin Le Luther will believe uh anything else but justification no sir that was his age he believed I I I believe he'll come in the resurrection amen it goes on down he says we're in Genesis 18 uh still in the 18th verse and let's watch then he taken him that second thing that he' done the first thing justification 12th chapter 15th was a chapter he gave sanctification 18th or if he meant the 17th he gave the Holy Ghost it says now uh uh at the end watch here look quickly all these others took years are you listening don't you love it all these years from justification to sanctification was a lap of years from sanctification till the confirmation of the Holy Ghost was years but in the same chapter he placed him after the Holy Ghost Pentecostal Pentecost is just 40-some years old you know and he began to place his his sons Martin Luther preached justification years and years and years come San uh just Martin Luther preached justification years and years and years came sanctification years and years and years come the baptism of the Holy Ghost but right quick after the Pentecost did the same thing the rest of them did and then he began to pull his sons that stood for his truth give him that something special magnified him before the people with a certain thing that he that he stood out and placed him then in the same chapter gives him a sign gives the Pentecostal a a church a sign at the end time Abraham has had a name Chang a few days and and was placed then as Elohim associated with God uh as as Elohim associ he associated with God isn't isn't it good to be a Holy Roller associated with God giving him part of his name now what kind of a name does his church have his name is is that right I come in my father's name and you receive me you receive Me Not Jesus name you see if any other will come in their name his organizational name you'll receive him but he Associated Abraham with his name and his church has his name now now now he is he he's he's going through the discussion here and we're just going to keep on uh uh pointing to this for a little while amen he's now he's given he's he's given the this is this is where we're at that this is the age of restoration started right here this is the Dark Ages amen now and it started and it started coming through and and uh Luther Wesley San uh sanctification baptism or or uh let's see I'm I'm I'm messing it up here Luther Wesley bapti AP ISM of the Holy Ghost and then right after now now these were hundreds of years between Luther and Wesley God was dealing with them through justification and and it went hundreds of years then it was it was it was it was a hundreds of years went through here I don't know when Wesley when was Wesley in the in the 1700s huh 1750 okay to 1906 now he received the Holy Ghost here but then there had to be a Prophet come in the son of man had to come to earth now are you understanding the son of man could have never came in this stage could have never came in this stage It could only come in this stage are y'all are y'all catching me amen one's building on top of the other and that's why in your walk with now now now is there is there is there is there four stage is there four stages to the New Birth no there's not four stages to the New Birth you're Justified Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost today we you this we not just receiving a baptism when we receive the Holy Ghost today we are receiving the token life we're living in the adoption a right right right there's not force there's nothing after the New Birth there's there's nothing after the Holy Spirit you we are the stages of the the stages of the church are four stages justification coming on up sanctification coming on up baptism which brother Brandon would would would help us out and call it a dip he says it's a dip of the Holy Ghost it's not a filling it's a dip but when the word come that's when Christ could come back as he come in the beginning and fill his church amen now now and and since there's just a few of us here you've got any questions raise up your hand or holler at me all right any any questions here tonight as we're going don't don't feel don't feel ashamed amen now now what is the son of man it's the fullness of the Holy Ghost in flesh okay manifesting the promised word in the bride body giving the word life now brother brenon would put it this way he says the church has now served and I've quoted this for the last four Services the church but I'm but I'm finally reading it the church now has served the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said here making Malachi 4 and the rest of these scriptures real to you in the last days just before the coming the world sitting uh will be like Sodom and the son of man will reveal himself as the son of man like he did in the days of Sodom now now before we can we continue There we want to say the son of man was a prophet the prophet Ministry yes that was the son of man that was God in flesh that appeared unto Abraham but what did God in flesh do all right his words were now going to take effect to two old people sure right and the promise that Abraham had been waiting on and hoping for and yet so far far out of its grasp was now visible right there before him and he says according to the time of life you're going to have a son now it sounded so impossible to to Sarah that she started laughing and saying but no no no no the words from the son of man had changed the lives of two two old people that's good right well praise the Lord what is this son of man today you say well if the son of man was here it would have to be Jesus Christ Amen brother brother Bram would say amen he he he would say the son of man uh he he he would say uh blind prosecutor can't you see that his words are true not nail scars and Prince and Thorns now now we're not looking for nail scars prints and Thorns when Christ appears as the son of man in this day how is he going to appear he's going to appear as Prophet God to call out a people to himself and a prophetic people are going to receive the power of the Holy Spirit well can you say Amen now now brother brandham would say in another place he says now we say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word said it they they said he's raised uh he's raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things would happen in the last days that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember Jesus was not talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him this was not Jesus he had not been born he had not been yet born but it was a man in human flesh that a Abraham called Elohim the great God well glory to God so so wasn't Jesus back there Jesus wasn't born Jesus was born he only had 33 years here on the Earth but it was the great God that lived in the body of Jesus that appeared unto Abraham and it's the same Elohim in this last day that has appeared in the body of his bride right amen now they're in the trial 64 brother Bram would say it's the Son of God impersonated in his church as son of man it has to fulfill Malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures I call the courts attention look look at that real good son of man like God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost it's the same thing it's the same God three different attributes of the same God now this is is the son of David or the a son of man revealed then as a prophet the son of David the king and now the Son of God to the church age as as as as God isn't man God is a spirit and the spirit the son is the Holy Ghost which which is revealing the the church Age The Promise here is in these last days the son of man would be revealed blind prosecutor do you get that I want you to know blind prosecutor we we see it we believe it these words fulfilled before us and we know that they are true to the Jews he was son of David to the Greeks he was Lord to us he's Lord to the Gentiles now in the last days he would return back as the son of man because Malachi promised us that there would be a prophet rise in the last days that would return the hearts of the the people back away from their or them organizations back to the original word the faith of the fathers the original Pentecost he says and when he did it John 14:12 The Works that that he did would be done also Revelations 10 promises the whole mystery how you going to reveal those Mysteries you see what Luther left off what Wesley left off what Pentecost left off and then to reveal the secret of the heart to make it the same God through every age which is nothing but God's word made manifest back to the son of man again we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest notice god promise these things now and he does it just as he said now amen so are are you staying with that then now you understand there got to be a prophet it is a the son of man is God in flesh through a prophet coming in amen because there is there is something he's not just here those words now now when when uh the son of man appeared unto Abraham now he didn't just do it just to make himself feel good Hallelujah he done it because there was a people that the promise had to be quickened to right are y'all hearing me yes sir all right now now brother how how many how many's following me so far yeah all right sir brother Bram would say the first three stages of them that went through the Dark Ages and then the third stage comes at the the the church comes out from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost incarnate God made manifest Among Us somebody say justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost incarnate God made manifest Among Us amen he's incarnate God made manifest Among Us here he comes as the Antichrist as the false prophet and the the then the Beast and the Dark Age and this is in the the third seal but he but he's uh uh it says and then the church comes out of those Dark Age justification now he's going to go back over it again he's going back over it justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word the way now okay that that that should make you want to shout the holy spirit that fell on was a baptism in 1906 but it wasn't it wasn't anything that could produce a promise yes sir it could not produce what God was looking for God had when when God came down in person it has to be the son of man and the son of man man can only come through a prophet listen to me up there in the sound booth amen here it comes justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word now here's another one in the Masterpiece it says notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tsel in the all gathers in the in the seed the life that was in in in the stock he says justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself okay okay amen now let's just call let's just call this Abraham and Sarah right here hallelujah amen that's right here they had gone chapter 12 they had gone chapter 15 okay chapter 17 but something was taking place right here when Prophet God came down the word was going to come off the printed page and would take on flesh right they were fixing to have the baby yes that they had been waiting for yes sir yes whatever took place right here was so powerful that the king in the later on in the in the 19th Chapter the 19th Chapter the king wanted Sarah for his wife whatever took place whatever took place whatever the son of man that conversation with the son of man produced something in the body now they were just they were just types God used them for types to show you who you are now I'm trying now I don't want to make this real complicated and am am I making it too complicated I don't want this to be complicated I and I don't and I don't want you kids looking out at at at at at denominationalism as if they've got something to offer they might have a lot of music and and and a lot of things like that the son of man cannot be was was never in any of these ages it can only it we're we're talking about God taking us back to Pentecost we're talking about dead race blind seeing deaf hearing we're talking about the supernatural Hallelujah you see what I'm saying we have have a right to expect God's word to live in us but it's not going to be just from the letter of the word the token life there's where the problem is with the message churches they've said they've taken they've taken the saying that they've got the Holy Ghost and and and and and and there's and there's nothing applied there there's there's and and what happens is the M churches have taken on easy believism it's nothing but a Baptist Dogma about it yeah that says all you have to do is believe and you've got the Holy Ghost brother bradam spent his entire life amen saying no believing is not the Holy Ghost come on come on Amen and and when the when you remember when the Baptist preacher came up to him and told him uh uh uh well I believe do you believe that Abraham believ and he was accepted imputed for righteous he said yes I do he says he says well then amen uh uh he says then then uh that that's the way we we believe un salvation and brother Bram says but he says what did he do after he believed and it was imputed unto him he went for circumcision which was a type of the circumcision of the heart the baptism are y'all understanding any question questions now come on there's now don't be waiting till after church and then because your dumb questions might help some of us other dummies amen so don't there is no dumb questions and while we're small here tonight uh uh just just say it because I can I I really do see a few uh puzzled looks amen I understand when you say that the church ages has four steps yes I understand that you made the comment that we only need the justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost yes but isn't there a part of that Holy Ghost for the for the bride of Christ because it's a promise it's a it's a token but on Earth today we have we have been lifted up in power to speak demons out is that just in because of the Holy Ghost because you got you got all the gifts you got all those things working with that part isn't that another step in our life yes it is but you can't it no no well but you you you but you've got to understand it there is never been okay let's go back let's go back to Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified brother Bram showed us the justification and then and then uh uh and then they were uh Sanctified amen and brother brandom said that that Judas was justified Sanctified but could not go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost okay so when they got to the baptism of the Holy Ghost did they have to wait for the fourth step before they went and healed the sick raised the dead well that that was when the Holy Ghost was that was when the Holy Ghost was on their spirit but this year was a filling it was it was the Divine filling that has been promised to this age they did not have to wait for four days or 10 days or 10 years to to to to find out if they're good enough to find out if okay amen now now I'm I'm now I can be adopted they were the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul says we have received the spirit of adoption right it it was the Holy Ghost it was that third stage but brother branam was telling brother brandham was telling the Pentecostals in the adoption series you've received the baptism but adoption time's coming you've got your three stages but adoption time is on its way they were they were they were ready to put brother brandham out aside brother brandham was already being pushed aside by the 1960 you know his his teaching but not you know he was he was preaching in 57 and 58 and he was already but but listen to me brother brother bradam was telling them you've got a baptism you and another place brother bradam says you've got a dip when did when did when did Revelations 10 when the mighty Angel come to Earth with the open book when was that 1963 so let's put it this way 1906 let me get a different color here so it'll stand up I like different colors 1906 and these guys the the Pentecostals were happy they said they arrived they thought that it was all that but there was another time coming 1963 this 1500s 1700s 1500s 1700s 1906 they thought they had arrived in the final stage of of of justification or or the final stage of of the Perfection of the plant brother Brandon is saying wait guys we're not there yet now brother brandham didn't even know yet brother brandham didn't know he knew a third pool was coming he knew that but he kept telling them you've got the Holy Ghost you're speaking in tongues you're doing all those things but God's to place you God's the fullness of who God is he's wanting to place you can you say amen amen hallelujah i h uh I'll would you go up my computer praise the Lord amen so so what so we we now now now how how many's understanding this so are we waiting today when you receive the baptism I I the Holy Ghost you are Justified Sanctified you've receive that same holy ghost that came in Revelations 101 the mighty angel coming down with brother bradam said was none other than Christ himself amen with an open book you're not baptized into here we're in the final stage of restoration so today you're Justified Sanctified and we are living in the season of adoption four stages of restoration three stages of Grace right you say no no no now brother wend that brother brandom says you cannot go past your threes over and over and over baptism or or the justification sanctification baptism but anytime when he was dealing with the bride tree he says it was four stages of death and it'll be four stages of Resurrection right okay uh uh uh how how did how did that go the Palmer worm po uh uh cankerworm uh caterpillar the Locust and then he says now there's four stages there's four messengers of Life Luther or there justification Wesley sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the seed that went into the ground at the beginning okay okay amen but don't substitute knowledge we're not in the managee don't substitute knowledge for the Revelation and the power of the Holy Spirit today that's right Hallelujah it had to take brother brother bham had to come in and preach the way he preached and bring out these depths so that you could understand who you are in this day not to make you a an intellectual giant did that answer your question let me let let me show you I'm just looking at how how when I was struggling through sanctification when I got filled with baptism the it settled me but then that hunger I wanted more well of the power of God well is that all in that Holy you know that's where I'm looking at yeah I you know with with me studying along these lines with with me coming along these lines I'm I'm uh uh you know I you know um the the the you you and I and maybe a lot of us might have come through that third sta or that that third stage of restoration we might have received we we might have re received a touch of the Holy Ghost and and and and yet we did not come on into that fullness and we're not adopted but you don't have to you you can you can you can receive the genuine power of the Holy Ghost right now tonight not have to wait for another before you receive the the genuine power you see what I'm saying now you know okay I know we're online and I don't I it's so I uh uh I I've been I've been talking with preachers lately just you know sharing my you know trying to and and um I so I talked to Donnie Reagan and um and and just ask brother Donnie now you're a Pentecostal boy so I was telling I I I I I'll tell you man I I have I I I I I have preached that 1963 anyone who received the genuine or receiv received the Holy Ghost from 1963 received the genuine holy ghost in 1963 Donnie brother Donnie he he says he says that he feels like he went through all four of those stages here he says that he he he says you know he was like me seen Miracles performed formed wonders signs but he says but when he come into the message it was not just a a a cleansing of his mind he he he he believes that that that brother that brother bradam taught and and I and I can see that that the token as I preached this morning the token could only come the token life could only come after the word the the the the message of the Hour come right right and and so we might have had a dip when Martin might have had a dip in Pentecost but when I come into the message and maybe that's why we were so unstable in Pentecost there was nothing to stabilize this but it was more than just somebody bringing a a h a a new form this here is not a new form of thinking but it's the Holy Ghost itself upon us so in that case is it possible that these kids can get the anointing upon their spirit and not upon upon their soul well you know I I yeah I think that I think we can do that I think we can it can fall Upon Our flesh and we do man we we manifest things and but what we're wanting is a birth it's a word birth y y'all Y am I making more sense am I making sense there so so and brother Bram says this is is a word birth and so I've talked with brother Brown uh brother Donnie I've talked with brother Tim um brother sha brother Wayne I've talked I've talked with several uh along those lines and just seeing you know where where they see the son of man and and so the but in this in this briad time in this in this son of man season amen uh uh let let me let let me show you um praise the Lord someone have anything to say long awaited restoration sorry well I I would ra what in the world um no no you uh I I I would rather you all understand what where where we're going here and so um okay so brother brandham said now the church age book he says um he says this age started just at the turn of the 20th century as it as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the Bride As she was at Pentecost y'all getting tired of me showing you bride Pentecost all right this is that's that's that's this is the time now he says he says uh uh as it as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the belie Believers sense this and in their spirits and begin to crying for to God for a new outpouring which was in the first century what what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speaking in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believ that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not it was if for the latter rain could only uh the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or the teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain what uh how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers had not come yet thus what was thought to be the restoration and the the final quaking unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of unrighteous uh partaking of spiritual blessings manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it was also devil Powers men was under the control of devils yet no one seemed to notice it then to prove that it was not real then these people after the second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines built their fences as every other group did before them so what they thought was the N this as the as as justification sanctification and as and then this as as they had at pent cost they said it was well that wasn't it that that wasn't it it was the shuck it was a dip of the spirit that was upon them but it was not the final restoration that would come from a word birth that they had at Pentecost okay y'all catching amen any questions amen all right so so see that question there helped others did that did that help that that show you why sister Carol we spoke in tongues before we come and we had all of those manifestations but the word had to come that word was the adoptions that's the time that's what the cloud was about when God took a prophet and the and and the Seven Angels Came Down the consummation of all Seven Ages all come together in a prophet over there in Arizona and told him go back and preach or open the Seven Seals right it that was the adoption time that was that was that that was the season now whether or not you've come into that adoption that's what I'm saying that was what my preaching was this morning we've got to come into that don't just take a little manif a little feeling or an emotion but that there's a word birth that'll produce the realities of this word in your bodies any other questions praise the Lord all right how many how many's game for a little longer all right so now this son of man could no could not come to Earth except through a prophet through through a prophet so it had to be amen that Mighty angel had to come directly to the seventh angel Messenger on the earth he would declare the book can you say Amen now now let's let let's let's uh let's just continue on amen he said that the sounding brother Brandon would say at the sounding of the seventh Angels message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared uh By His holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the book at the sound of ing of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the lucans that through these Church ages have been probed at will be wound together when when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon land and upon sea with the rainbow over his head now remember the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming amen so when when that when that coming when that when Christ steps forth Revelations 10:1 then the mighty or then that Earthly Angel would be here at that time all right how many's with me so far praise the Lord amen now I know that after we eat a whole bunch then we get sleepy and so I I don't want to be saying this in vain amen and uh amen I I I I want I I I I want the I want us to get it all right now so I'm just going to go through we're in that fourth we're in the astronaut this is the astronaut age amen what is the bride time you say I see that bride time up there what is that bride time brother Wendell amen well it's the calling out of of the Bride from the church system the shuck has pulled away brother brandham would say and the seed is is is not air with the Shu 65 the shuck has given has give forth its strength into the seed it's went on out it was a good shuck but it served its time so so the third stage was wonderful 1906 was wonderful amen but now it's time to give birth to the seed that was Brian time now now 64 turn on the light do you realize we've moved on from that we're in the bride time the selecting time the time that the bride that said we would have amen uh uh the same message he says he's bringing forth a bride and elect out of that group which there'll never be another church age the Philadelphian age was Wesley leoan age is the Pentecostal which all goes through this uh straight into the mark of the beast amen he's bringing the church out of that that uh uh uh the Shu amen another place he said recognizing your day in 64 he says God has recognized that there is a people on the Earth that he is predestined to life he's recognized this is the time to send his message and he did it the people has recognized it the bride time has realized the evening light okay amen okay but it wasn't just a calling out he says now it uh the seed shall not be a with a Shu 65 now it's seed time or bride time the Shucks are dead the Shucks dried up the Virgin time not touched it's a virgin remember a virgin word time so so he is so he is bringing these in there is a people on the earth that is not mixed with these with the Vine a any longer this is a people who God's very own life is living in it's a time of restoration amen amen so you don't want my opinion I don't want your opinion and we don't want no one else's opinion God has came supernaturally to give us this word because it's virgin SE time in the womb of the Bride we're fixing to produce that brand spanking new body well glory to God well what does this have to do with the astronut you're far beyond you're far beyond the chickens you're beyond the plane you're beyond the horses you're beyond you're you're beyond all the clouds you're you're you're up there with the so in free to believe free to expect yes you say but brother W I'm fighting with unbelief I'm fighting you don't have to I'm telling you this is the age that God's wanting us to come up amen is that right well praise the Lord amen amen now I'm going to read just a few more and then I'm going to close here just just just a few more here and and and just just I want because I want I want you to see I want you to see see son of man is not just a prophet son of man is the words manifested in you right we don't we don't it we wouldn't have the same story they they wouldn't have the same story If Abraham just shook the son of man's hand and said Prophet God it was good man is a man you just made me feel so warm fuzzy inside no he came to speak his word and and those words changed the bodies those words brought the answer after he gave him his name are are y'all catch y'all see that God had to pull us out of these denominational thinking so that his holy spirit could come Revelations 10 to bring this reality all right I'm going to I'm just going to show I'm just going to read you a bunch of quotes here just real quickly amen he says not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom will call uh the call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the m manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman he says it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us will make his word so real until it'll unite that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage amen he says the Rapture is the going of the uh uh to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person it's this great son as so in a god this great Eternal God coming down and living in you brother brandom said it never happened since Pentecost all right okay all right yes sir he says when the word here unites with the person the two become one and then what it what does it do then it manifests are you are you ready when the word here unites with a person they two become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not in church theologians Creeds dogmas opinions the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen now he uh I'm going to cut through some of these things here I'm just I want to hit I'm I'm just going to highlight because I do have a lot of quotes and then we'll continue going on as as we go but I I I I I I didn't know I I thought I would I brought this just in case amen I didn't know what kind of service it would be and um uh but I do know that Sunday nights are awfully hard after you get through eating and so but but but watch this and and I'm and and and there's a one it's the it's a beautiful quote amen but uh uh uh he says now in the last days he's promised this another another quote here this is from um Christ revealed in his own word 65 now in the last days he's promised to be manifest to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit that's so beautiful in these last days he has promised to manifest himself again in himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit in other words what he was in the body of Jesus Christ what he was in that early Pentecostal church he will once again be in this last day bride amen does that mean that we're not whatever you saw in Christ sure yes you understand why my message this morning why I was saying that Pharaoh wanted to keep the people busy if he can keep you busy keep your mind going you'll never have time to enter into that secret place and here you are the very bride of Christ and he wants to impregnate your heart he wants his life to be so living in you and if you don't get anything else that I that I've said today I'm I'm praying that you understand this part of me what I'm saying this is precious this is the adoption message amen it's exactly the way it was with Jesus when they took him up to the mount it was God showing what his Earthly body would do through the 2,000 years amen Jesus was justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost taken up there on on Mount Transfiguration showing us what it was what with the stages that we were going to be going through and showing us who we are in this last day When God says this is my beloved Son hear ye him and he's taken the church out on the mountain we've come through justification sanctification baptism of the spirit and God has come in our generation with a cloud seven angels giving us the book and saying he ye her okay there you go I got all those quotes in here I I got a whole bunch of them in here that is just powerful but but let let me finish this quote here it says for as it was in the days of Sodom so it be in the coming of the son of man Jesus being made manifest in bodily form of his church today doing the same things the same work the same things that he did all the time never changes the Eternal one upon Earth today he has manifested himself in human body bodies Our human bodies that he has called he has done exactly the same thing he done in Sury times in the times of his flesh upon the Earth well praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah he says now there's he says now he says it it the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into the one person Jesus Christ bride and body at the physical Return of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm I'm just skipping down through here some highlights that I'd highlighted and they they just exactly manifested the same she is part of him because she was taken out from him and the bride today is taken out from the body of Christ which is acting and doing just exactly what he said it would do for this day the bride the Queen the king and the queen praise the Lord in the trial he he preached several messages on the trial amen but he says I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh in the bride's body okay oh glory to God Luke he he he says he says Luke here Luke 17th chapter and Malachi 4 the SE uh the different scriptures that we're acquainted the word again is waved over the people the Dead traditions of man is dead the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right Among Us and is giving us life life do you remember when brother Bram says that he says the Holy Ghost has been has been bound by the uh behind the doors of denominational Creeds for 2,000 years but he says but in the evening time the Holy Ghost will be released again in the church by the evening time [Applause] message I I say Lord this is the hour this is the hour don't let me just be numb and don't let me let let let me Lord I I I I we we see a lot of possibilities we see daddy with his Parkinson's we see we see brother Ron now I I you know there ain't none of us that can just go in empty hospitals or go to anybody and and tell them but I'm saying this is the season that God can use one of us right I I can't tell God what to do that's not that's not the deal Jesus didn't tell God what to do Jesus says my meat is to do his will he lives in when you see me you've seen the father Jesus said yeah there you go he was expecting God to live and manifest through him that's good yes sir and the prophet why does he say it over and over and I've got again I got 30 pages here the over and over the bride coming the word time the word coming the Capstone age what's he saying we're [Music] here not in the future we've already passed the Pentecostal stage we're here help me Lord amen he says in the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of the dark denomination will be a message that the full maturity of the word is report returned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there when that church come to its fullness right there at Pentecost Amen brother brandham says that was the word being waved over the people expressed what Jesus had had had had paid for can you say amen amen praise the Lord now amen he says now a uh when I see the token I'll pass over you a positive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you've passed from Death to life that's all there is to it because the life is in you you can no more perish amen the next one in the token in Shri port in 63 he says now we have a token in this day we've been given a token which is an antitype of that type of that of that natural token we've been given the supernatural Supreme token all all that foreshadow has been given to this generation it's been given this to it's been given a token now we have the Holy Ghost as our token it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus just a human life to come back upon us but it was God himself manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are Sons and Daughters of God this is the token it's our identification of the Passover it's our identification that we have believed God and God has accepted it amen another place he says Christ Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings showing the signs that he promised he would amen another place if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifesting in the last days the son of man revealing himself in the church human flesh making himself no do you get it see God down here in his church making him again the word the son of man being revealed in the church as it was in the days of Sodom another place he couldn't he says he says it's the no l among you that brings the entire fullness of the bhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested and revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God with his amongst his people all right couldn't happen in those are y'all understanding why they had leans leans they all had leans he had something against him you've lost your first life I've got somewhat against the I've got against you I've got against you I've got against you I've got against you by this age here he's kick clean out of the church right and yet God is in Bride form living the same life that he did at the early yeah brother when you have been bapt when you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost don't you go outside here thinking you're going to have to earn anything from God it's the blood that does it the blood's already cleansed you you have you have been given you are feasting on the body word of the son of man you're eating that you are cleansed with that word you are you are not the prostitutes of Le oosa you're not the Shu you are Sons and Daughters of God you're the Bride of God you are everything that that Prophet has put out there this is who you are amen now Lord I'm going to lay in the presence of the sun I want to rap it I'm going to have to get out in the presence of the Sun in order to ripen can you say Amen do you love him has has this has this been all right for you tonight I brought a lot of these quotes because I thought well maybe we could just share quotes and if we did turn into a question and answer we could amen I don't know I got to quit looking at my iPad amen amen he says now in these last days he's promised to manifest it this is another these are entirely different quote I mean I'm telling you these are nuggets in this message amen he says now in in these last days he's promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit he goes on down and says and upon Earth today he has manifested himself in human bodies Our human bodies that he has called can you say Amen well aren't you glad for his holy spirit amen you know what I want to say I I don't want 2024 and and and again I you you you you know we have to go by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and and and I've been in that inspiration right at the first of the year and I think God's doing this for a reason now I couldn't you know preachers you know you can't just get up and preach on something unless it's it's you're you're you're when but when the Holy Spirit is working on you you you you just it cuz cuz it is it is it's who we are and I'm thinking let this be the Year let this be the year of a great great moving up let us move up Rapture is upon us friends there's going to be a baptism of the Holy Ghost that sweeps down to catch us all way for the final adoption and that will be the changing of our bodies amen can you say Amen so as yes yes brother William going back to your there there there's some of you that are in the Holy Ghost life of justification there's some of you that might be in the Holy Ghost life of sanc uh justification sanctification or maybe you've you've received a moving of God but I want to tell you let's let's let's let's come on up into the very life of God coming Upon Us amen sin has vanished fear has vanished have I left anybody confused tonight any more questions I have got my iPad off so don't worry about that hallelujah amen yeah that we're all going back to Pentecost through Pentecost do you think we can go any higher than that like in the garden yes yes and that's a that's that's an excellent question because we do have something more than than this here what what this this here now this was this was the manifestation of God after the coming of the uh uh after the resurrection of Christ the Old Testament this was the fullness of that word being waved over the people this this church was destined to go back into the ground right this church is destined to go up so when the word came in this day the prophet did not just come in and and and and and and and uh uh you know tell you that you are a son of God and come back and you need to you need to uh come back to the you know uh uh uh dress codes and you need to baptize right and you need to we believe in predestination and we and a prophet came in through and the pillar of Fire Vindicated all of that for our faith but this was the age where the book was open and that open book has nothing left but Rapture yeah this church didn't have the open seals this they were blinded to what was going on this church is going to have this with a promise of rapture rightall does that make sense or no it's not just restoring because because it's not just a restoring back to the Bible doctrines this is not the restoring back to the Bible doctrines this is more than going back to the Bible doctrines this is an the book being open the leans have are being ripped off the leans of all of these all of these dogmas and teachers and and all of these these men that put all of these leans on the church and and there was no there they couldn't believe nothing because my goodness worshiping Mary and praying to Peter and you know and then then they come out and in Luther's age and then they go right back to uh Bishops and all and and all it was it it the church has been a mess and Le oosa shows how me big of a mess the church is in until they can truly think that God is doing something in their midst and God is no God is so far away from that denominational system I don't care whether your denomination or UND denomination if you're not in the word and yet they they they're it's so far away but it took this time for the opening of the book to show us the two Vines to show us the insects and the brid tree it took the opening of the book to show us the grafting and how it has happened all down through these ages it's took the open of the book to show us these things yes we've got something far beyond Pentecost you see what I'm saying but the original Life The Original Seed is here we're here and we'll have nothing any different as far as experience than this other than Rapture he's destinated you he's predestinated you to Rapture you see that not they they try to say oh brother brother you could you could write the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelations with the he goes no no no no no no no even though seven Thunders have got to be found in the word they were just hidden till this time if they had known it ahead of time maybe this would be a different situation right maybe this church would have been raptured after all but God didn't want them raptured so God blinded their eyes to see this because there had to come an elect of this age elect of that age and you're going to see that as we go through the ages and all these things but the last time now's our season and our season ain't going to the ground our season is not another is is another cycle of death our season is heavenward hallu get the token don't go for emotionalism and I'm all you guys know me I am 100% for emotions I am 100% I I love dancing and shouting and when the spirit of the Lord is moving I'm the I'm I'm the biggest clown Among Us amen I love it I love it I love when the Holy Ghost comes I love running the aisles I love doing my little little jig I love it it's not the emotions the Holy Ghost is not the emotions it's the life that has been changed can you say amen amen did that answer your question anybody else brother Merl and thank you for this teaching this is wonderful that the power in this message the revealed word is like she's talking about is there more power than just to take us back to Pentecost it's a power to where the scripture says it'll be have a bride without spot or wrinkle or any blemish amen sinless yeah yeah and that you know the the bride that Through the Ages they cannot be made perfect without us amen it has to be a a a fru a mat ripening in the presence of the sun amen and brother talk about that per three-fold purpose to take us back to that take us back to like it was in the Garden of Eden that's right that's the power that's in the message and and and and I'm glad you brought that up because what did Adam have Adam had the spoken word what was displayed here something greater brother brandham never spoke or or Jesus never spoke anything into existence he took water turned it into wine he took mud and healed the eyes our day our time because we're not this is time to go back to Eden squirrels were spoken to existence that's right amen spoken word are y'all now now I I I've got in and and if the Lord if if y'all just got to pray that I st keep under that inspiration but I I've got I've got some quotes where brother brandom says the time is coming where you will speak limbs onto EX in into to well that was before the opening of the seals we are here there's nothing more that can come than what God has given we've got to take that word and and and and and pray that God get this is why we've got to have we've got to have the ministry brother Brandon says the ministry is to keep that church clean not just to make us feel good but but we got to keep sin out of the church we got to die out there's got to be a spiritual church y'all remember what brother brandham brother brandham was was was preaching somewhere and he says now just the morning he said my my deacons he said there was a lady that had died and my and and and and my deacons went down to the went went down to the funeral home where they had just taken her and they all laid hands on her and brought her back to life he says now that's a that's that's that's a well taught church I've and I thought I'm part of his church there you are I want to be well taught I want the Holy Spirit to have that in I don't I don't want to try to be a prophet I don't want to be try all I want to be is who I am I just want to say my meat is to do the will of him that sent me we were talking today over at at lunch amen uh uh uh uh contentment with godliness is great gain contentment with godliness just being content with my Lord being content with his word loving him and saying Lord I'm here in this stage of my mind my life you've got me here for a reason I'm in a uh you maybe maybe you're in a tough place tonight maybe you're fighting sickness maybe you're in a in a tough place on your job or maybe you've got a tough place in your family or may you know what whatever it is maybe you kids are in a tough place but God's got you there so Lord let me be content and let me be Godly let let me be Godlike that's what godliness is Godlike reflect yourself through me even in even in the nighttime of my life you could be in the fifth age you could be at the beginning of the seventh age but you're at the end of that you're at the end of this lsy and age hallelujah hallelujah anybody else have anything to add or or or any questions praise the Lord I I appreciate this tonight I and I I do I I appreciate y'all uh uh I I want to know that that that I'm that were uh you know uh what Dad said the other day when he talks about the three sermons that the preacher preaches you know you that that is so true you go through all the study and you think okay I well I know and and I was back in the office tonight thinking man there's a bunch of quotes for one service you know and and uh and then you get up and preach and then after you go home you go for a week thinking ah you're a big flub oh that didn't go over all that didn't so it's it is nice to know if if if the word is having an effect listen this word is so precious what makes what's the difference in the son of God God the Holy Ghost interceding blessing calling Luther up the Holy Ghost the same life calling these others up calling on up but his whole purpose was to live in the seed in this last day come off the pages and live here yes what he wants to do and it's it's a million miles from legalism a million miles from legalism amen yeah well I I you know and I think a lot of us are that way a lot of us are that way and sister Carol God's wanting us unsettled he's wanting us to get unsettled if we get too content and we get too we we get too content in making our way and doing those kind of things we're we're we're never going to look for Exodus but part of the prophet's coming and as I read that scripture to you this morning when the people came to to Moses and said you're making things worse God was trying to get the people unsettled he don't want them happy with their homes he don't want them happy with their jobs he don't want them now I'm not talking about contentment I'm talking there's a difference in in settledness unsettling discontentment amen I I I am content with the will of God in my life but I I I got a Restless spirit I want to go home amen amen y y'all catching that praise the Lord anyone else hallelujah amen yes yes amen take that book and eat it and and and that's where we are you remember how you you you've you've you've been here for the whole journey part of my in my journey here in Pon in the church and and we can see we we we can see all of those that the promising ones and they fell off and they came and they fell off they've done this they've done that they oh I don't want I I don't want just a dip of the Holy Ghost I want the full I want the Holy Ghost himself this is the adoption message whether or not you're adopted that that's that that's that's you've got to have that token life you've got to have that token life but I'm here to tell you it's not in the future you can have that true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can experience the son of man amen well the adoption message was here when I was in [Laughter] Pentecost right but I was still in the Shu right and there's where you and I both were at brother William we had to come up had to come on up praise the Lord anyone else amen glory to God all right well let's let's uh the musicians would come I don't even know what time it is amen I um have I been up here a long time I lost my watch huh 7:05 woo I've been up here a long [Music] time anything that has ever preached across the pull pit here I hope you don't take it as legalism there are times we have to straightly hit sin Fashions we got to hit but I I don't want any of us to ever come in into the thing that we have to earn anything from God and if we're still in that thinking we're still under we're still we're still under the denominational thinking that's not what God has God's wanting his word to have the life of that word expressing through he wants it word made flesh what what was that what was that quote justification sanctification Holy Ghost an Incarnate Word that's the logos brother brandham says the adopted sons of the last day he says uh he says the pillar of fire lives in the adopted sons of the last day now the Thunder movement says it's out in the future you're going to be adopted one of these days it's going to be adopted one of these days that's it's not the way brother Bram taught it this is the adoption message why did Brother why why why did brother brandom say over and over and over and over and over bride time Bri this is bride time bride age bride this word age word coming a Capstone age uh uh uh he he airplane a or or uh uh astronaut age he used all of these to tell us it's not coming the fourth stage is here it happened from 63 y'all catch that so don't be looking for something way out there it's here amen amen now Lord I want to apply that token because the blood is greater in this age than any other age this is rapturing time and I have a right to believe God for miracles healings I have a right Hallelujah someone had asked I in a interview just felt like she didn't have the Holy Ghost and I met this was I believe it was in' 65 and you know just just didn't know and brother brandham had looked and said you got it but she couldn't accept that she wanted some kind of a he said well then sister why don't you just ask God to let you speak in tongues he said just ask God he said why if you want to speak in tongues your Nature's want you've got you need something that you can hold on to she says what we're just going to pray that God will let you do that it's one of the nine spiritual gifts [Music] amen yeah so so we the the thing is is we want to remove all hindrances from our faith remove everything we're not chickens and we don't belong in the barnyard we just don't
