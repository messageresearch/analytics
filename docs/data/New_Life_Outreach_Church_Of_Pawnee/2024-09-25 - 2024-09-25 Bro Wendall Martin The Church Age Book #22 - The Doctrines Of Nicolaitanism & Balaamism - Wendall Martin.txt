and the 14th verse says but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that host the doctrine of balum who taught BAC to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication ation so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate uh repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your your your blessings and and all of your goodness thank you for being so kind to us Lord and you are so um you're you're so precious to us and the older we get and I think that's of all ages the older we get in you and Lord the the more we understand or we we we we start to uh comprehend at least a little bit how much you love us and we thank you for that Lord now Lord we're asking that you would help us tonight as we as I as we read your word and just ask for your anointing upon me and upon the congregation and we want Lord to grow in you and to come closer to you father and we'll give you glory and honor have your way tonight in Jesus name can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated so um we're going to start reading here tonight on U page 197 and um and and we're going to uh read um and we're going to speak tonight uh on the doctrines of the nicians and of balum and so that's going to be in our reading tonight um and so uh we are um I'm glad to be back in the back in the U Church age book and uh sure sure enjoy it I also want to say uh before we get started that I the the yard looks so nice out there um everyone that worked um the other day and last night and uh that they came out and and uh cut up the limbs and and hauled them off we just say God bless you and um say the pictures and and um you young people and and even you sisters out there working and and to me that's just you know I I I've always wanted to be a part of everything I had some pastoral work I had to do last night or I would have been here too but um uh I I just think it's so wonderful to make it a family effort and um so we just say God bless you it really did look nice and and um and I you know Brotherhood is a is a thing that you have to strive for and um you know there's always going to be um people in every congregation that's just satisfied coming to church and just doing their part there but I I just don't believe that you Christianity is not where you click in and click out it's it's uh it's not a time uh card or or we we just all jump in and we we just see the kingdom of God going on and wanting to do something for the Lord um and and and do it together as in unity and so I was blessed to see that last night and and we just say God bless you it well I tell you what that's a big pile of trees out there Limbs and things and so um and I and I seen the slide platform it didn't it it's it survived it looked like for the most part and um um this time we'll um put it in the ground and uh well we built we had built it out here on the on the parking lot and uh our goal our Our intention was to um have it out here and then end up taking it over to the fellowship hall but after we got it up there we said we ain't moving this thing and the wind said yes we are amen so blew it over but um so it was it it's it is uh it was nice for that we appreciate you Brothers doing that as well praise the Lord let's look here um we're going to start at page 197 and um we're going to start there um the doctrine of the nick itans uh and and we will um we we have already read that verse so we're not going to read that again so we'll just start down to that other paragraph it says you will recall that I brought uh out in the Ephesian age that the word nickan comes from two Greek words NOA which means to conquer and Leo which means the Ley letin means to conquer the Ley which which is why uh uh now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which with uh which moves with political mindness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men who lead the the people through the feeding them with the word he has not separated people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but uh but then so must the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where priest or ministers or such mediate between God and the people there is no place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and to serve him together nickan ISM destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the ministers overlords o overlords instead of servants now I I think this is this is so important because and this is the reason why um any of us that are in the leadership position it's not just now that's not now it is it is for the five-fold ministry for sure then that's what we're dealing with here um and and especially that of a of a pastor but it's so important if we had that kind of mentality amen and under have that understanding uh in our homes for you brothers and dealing with your wives and your children uh you wives you mamas that are dealing with your children we we we don't just we don't want to come across as overlords we we're not we we we should be selfless in the fact that uh uh you know uh um it it should not be me me me this is not this is not about me this again this is about a team amen and whether it's the whether it's it's it's um uh you know brother Robert and sister uh Brianna back there with no children they're still a team they're they're a part of the M marriage covenant or or whether it be Kobe and Mary with with their children it's the family as a team uh whe whether it's here as the you know me as pastor and and and then uh uh uh the musicians we're we're Team song leaders deacons trustees and so what there is there is no Overlord there has to be leadership but it's for one common goal and and that is amen for the furtherance of the family the furtherance of the Gospel the furtherance of the local of the Church of whatever it is and so you you know and and and if you go back we've I I you know i' I've quoted this many of times but over there in 3:30 page 330 um brother brother Branham would talk about one that that that a wrong spirit this is this is the way a wrong Spirit works and and again sometimes we want to put this with just being preachers but you leaders you men and and and leading your family you mamas in in teaching your children you know you you've you've got to uh and I've and I've had y'all to mark this before so um it it is it is halfway down about the middle of the page um it says now in every case um we're just down right below the middle of that page and if you haven't marked it yet then you need to mark it amen now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word can you say Amen now that's any kind of a leader that is whether it be Pastor evangelist Prophet teacher husband uh uh a deacon or or whatever anybody in that leadership position it says now outside the word just as we have showed you that Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own somebody say own devilish ends have you ever noticed how that people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear so a man that is constantly that's just constantly keeping his his wife under his thumb that's an evil spirit those you you you that are that are that are constantly manipulating even your children that's an evil spirit amen we have a reason for our leadership it is not to make something or or to to to build around yourself you are we are building around the scripture we're never building around us and our demands were building around the scripture and the scripture has placed the the the husband as the head of the wife and the the wife is to take care of the children and and govern the home and those so we want we fall so the The Authority is there but we're doing it under the authority of the scripture so as pastors I can only lead you as I feed you so every one of us and as leadership and this is something for you for for you young men amen y'all keep that in your mind as well because we all because because we're all leaders amen us men are called to be leaders that's just all there is to it we're all supposed to to be leaders in in whether it be in our family some's going to be leaders in in business some's going to be lead you know but but we are but but men are called to lead and and we want to always keep that in our mind as as we look at this God give me the heart of a servant so that I can truly follow you in order to lead others can you say Amen so you want to be that kind of a leader now it says um it says have you noticed that uh lead themselves astray um bind themselves closely by fear and they say that if people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ he won't tell them to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says notice how these people like Judas are out for money now we're not going to go on through that so but I just wanted to bring that uh uh uh bring that back in let's go back to page 197 now now again he says nickel adism destroys those precepts and instead separates ministers from the people making ministers or the leaders overlords instead of servants now this Doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age it appears that the problem laid in the two words Elders presbyter overseers Bishops though uh though scripture shows that there are several Elders in each church and some ignacius among them uh began to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority or control over the elders now now the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man now I don't have I don't have the uh my chalkboard up here but now so so there are Elders in this congregation there's there's a bunch of us Elders uh that that are here and and the and the and the scripture and it says the Elder is is the man the bishop is the office Elder always has and always will refer to Simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord he is an elder not because he is elected or ordained Etc but because he is older he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience long-standing proof of his Christian experience but no the Bishops did not stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather they went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus uh to to meias uh Amen in in Acts 20 in verse 17 the record States Elders were called and then in 28 um they are called overseers Bishops and these Bishops no doubt political minded and anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than local Elder than than the local Elder with the official capacity in his own church to them a bishop was now with extended authority over many local leaders in the different churches uh such as a concept such concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the stature of polycarp lean toward such organization thus uh that which started as a deed in the first age was made aital Doctrine and so it is today Bishops still control uh claim uh Power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work whereinto I have called them this is anti- word and Antichrist now so so what brother Brenham is dealing with is in the organizational world you have got your you have got your your your pastor then you have got the bishop they don't they don't consider the pastor as the bishop they they have a bishop that is over a a a region of pastors and then you've also got those and it just and it goes up and up and up and up and up until everyone is controlled it's all the the control is is trickled down until the local Elder the local Pastor uh has no jurisdiction he can't he can't say what he's what what the scripture says because the organization says you have to baptize in Trinity baptism and so now he has he doesn't have the ability to follow the word of God he doesn't have the say if not he loses his pension he loses his his his his his church he loses it oh and and as we we we were talking uh my wife and I were talking today about the um uh here in in in paon E some years back with um the Methodist Church and so uh you you all we all know that the Methodist Church has become so liberal uh you know until they're they're ordaining lesbians and and and and a lot of that kind of stuff well um what was what was that pastor's name uh yeah Clen Dozer so Clen Dozer who I did not agree with at all um theologically but yet he had he had enough gumption uh to stand against it and so uh he was the the Methodist Church was across the street from the school and so he would feed all of those Middle School uh students any of them that would want to come uh down in the basement he would feed him and um and and would teach to him teach him and he and he had quite an audience and uh um but he and he and he started preaching against homosexuality and and so it the word got back to the uh what you know all the chains of command up and they had a meeting and told him either he's going to have to recant that uh uh or or he's going to have to you know and they they gave him the options and he says I'm I'm not going to do that now this man um he he ended up being fired let go from the church and lost his pension because of his conviction now I think they went to court and and and and I don't know I think he ended up getting his his retirement pension but that's so sad that that that the word of God has no effect or has has no jurisdiction and so what we should be thankful for and this is why even in the messes church we we must refuse use that that uh that system that nickol letin system that says hey you guys have got to do what we say you do up here in Jeffersonville we will play the tape and you guys you know you can have a pastor by title only but we don't want him up there pastoring or preaching he can push the play now that's not even that's not even close to scriptural but yet we have got hundreds of churches who who the pastor have came under that and have quit preaching and it's and they have come under that nickan spirit and that is not the plan God's church is to be free amen the anointing is to be free the the the power of the holy spirit is to work in that local congregation and it's not just one man the pastor or it's not just but it is the local body alog together that God is is uh has has called being the living organism can you say Amen now so let's go on and um let's see here uh where did we okay so um okay so now we we stop there he says uh separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work where unto I have called them this is anti- and Antichrist Matthew 20 25-28 but Jesus Jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister to give his life a ransom for many now again you can apply this to the family as well Matthew 238 and9 but uh but be ye not a RAB called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ all ye are Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven now he says in order to clarify this even more let me explain nanism in this way you recall in Revelations 13:3 it says and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly womb was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now we know the wounded head was the Pagan Roman Empire that great political world power the head rose again as the Roman Catholic spiritual Empire which uh now watch this careful uh what what did political Pagan Rome do uh that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered it was the seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth torn and uh tore and devoured whom uh whom she tore and deved could not rise again as she destroyed Carthage and sold her to the salt the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same divide and conquer that is nickan ISM and God hates it now amen nickan ISM can come right in the church in any form anything to try to divide separate conquer try to bring in my own little opinions amen and and it'll start with this click that click this click God wants no clicks God wants us all as one as as as one Union we are the body of Jesus Christ amen there's no big there's no little there's no Rich there's no poor amen there's no uh goodlooking ugly we're all we're all the children of the most high God can you say Amen now he says now it is well known his it's a well-known historical fact that when this error crept into the church men begin to VY for the office of Bishop with the result that his position that this position was being given the more to the more educated and materially Progressive and politically minded men human knowledge and program began to take over Divine wisdom's place and the Holy Spirit no longer controlled this was indeed a tragic evil for the Bishops begin to maintain that it is no longer required a transparent Christian character to minister either the word or the rights in the church for it was the elements and the ceremony that counted this allowed evil men seducers to Ren the flock with the man-made doctrine of the elevation of Bishops to a place not accorded them in scripture The Next Step was the handing out of graded titles that built up into uh a religious hierarchy soon there were archbishops over Bishops and Cardinals over the archbishops by the time the uh the time of bonfice III there was a pope over all a pontiff what what with the nician doctrine uh and the uh agation Alam all right of Christianity with the Babylonian ISM the net results had to be what Ezekiel Saw in chapters 8 uh in chapter 810 so I went in and saw and behold every form of creeping thing and abominable beast and all the idols of the House of Israel portrayed upon the wall around Revelations 18:2 and he cried with a mighty voice saying bab uh Babylon the great is Fallen is Fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornications now this nickan Doctrine this rule that was established in the church did not hit off too well with a lot of the people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the word written by some Godly person so what did the church do it excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the Scrolls they said it takes a special education to read and understand the word why even Peter said that many things wrote uh that Paul wrote were hard to understand having taken away the word from the people it soon came to the people listening only to what the priest had to say and doing what he was told what he told them he called um they called that God and His holy word they took over the minds and lives of the people made them Servants of a despotic priesthood now if you want proof that the Catholic demands and uh that the Catholic Church demands the lives and minds of men just listen to the Edict of theodosius uh to and the first edict says this edict was issued immediately after he um was baptized by the First Church of Rome we three Emperors will that our subjects steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by the St Peter to the Romans which has been Faithfully preserved by tradition which is now professed by the pontiff Damascus of Rome and Peter Bishop of Alexandria a man of apostolic Holiness according to the institution of the Apostles and the doct of the Gospel let us believe in one godhead of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit of equal Majesty in the Holy Trinity we order that the adherence of this Faith be called Catholic Christians we brand all senseless followers of other religions with the INF Infamous names of Heretics and forbid their vinal assuming the name of the churches besides the condemnation of divine Justice they must expect heavy penalty with which our Authority given uh Guided by Heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict now here here we are now the church has is totally ran by men and and and God is totally out now totally gone the spirit of the Lord can't dwell there the spirit of the Lord can't can't dwell because it's nothing is according to the scripture you see and then you even look and and the next the next uh um paragraph here says and the 15 penal laws that this Emperor issued in as many years um deprived the evangelicals of All rights to exercise their religion excluded them from all civil offices threatened them with fines confiscation banishment and even in some cases death do you know what we are headed right that way today the Roman Catholic Church calls herself the mother church now someone someone sent um today I don't know if it was someone here but where where um where the pope has has declared himself uh the the one was that you that sent that what um I couldn't get it to open they was wanting me to go on so but I read a little bit of it um but um uh where he is he is declaring a one world religion and and so this is this is a a a a big deal and I I I can't wait to read it um and then I think brother Mitch mentioned the other night uh I I haven't looked it up but brother mention mentioned that he had heard that that maybe uh or that that that um uh yeah that he endorsed Donald Trump uh for president what the these kinds of things you know they they they mean a lot and uh and and so um sorry I got distracted there for a minute amen and been there done that amen um you get up your foot's asleep amen but uh but but it's so uh we want we want the holy spirit in our lives in our churches how many wants the Holy Ghost in our church how many wants the Holy Ghost in our homes it it's so so important it's so important because we we make religion and I I I we make religion as if just a a you know uh uh once or twice a week thing but but that's not it the Holy Spirit wants to flow in each individual life each individual family each individual congregation amen and and there is a one day he's going to come and take us all amen and Rapture us all and give us a body change can you say Amen now so he says now um he says we're headed that way right today the Roman Catholic Church calls herself the mother Church she calls herself the first or the original church this is absolutely correct she was the the she was the original First Church of Rome that backslid and went into sin she was the first that organized in her was found the deeds and then the doctrine of nianis no one will deny that she is a mother she is a mother and has produced daughters now a daughter comes out of a woman a woman robed in Scarlet is sitting in the Seven Hills of Rome she is a harlot and is born daughters those daughters are the Protestant churches that came out of her and went right back into organization of nanism this mother of the daughter Church of this mother of the daughter churches called a that is what a woman who was untrue to her marriage vows she was married to God then went off fornicating with the devil and in her fornication she has brought forth daughters that are just like her this mother and daughter combination is anti- word anti-p Spirit consequently Antichrist yes Antichrist now different versions totally different versions uh not not everyone's pray to to Mary not everyone's bowing at statues not everyone is uh uh doing those things but again that that's why they call mother and daughter they they're not the same in in that regard she's the Catholic church and a Lutheran will never be a Catholic a Methodist will never be a Catholic a Pentecostal will never be a Catholic but yet they all came from her they got her denominational ideas from her even though they're different different dogmas different teachings different ways they are still anything contrary to the word is adultery against the word amen amen so so um so he says now before I get uh too far along I want to mention that these early Bishops thought they were above the word they told the people they could forgive their sins upon confession of those sins that never was the truth they began to B baptized infants in the 2 Century they actually practice regeneration baptism no wonder people are mixed up today if if they were so mixed up then so close to Pentecost now they are in the most desperate condition being 2,000 years away from the original truth oh Church of God there's only one hope get back to the word and stay with it can I hear an amen now the doctrine of balum Revelations 2:4 thou Hast them there that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Bao to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed into idols and to commit fornication now you just can't have a nickan setup in the church and not have this other Doctrine come into you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship and they that worship me must worship me in spirit and truth then you have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and uh and substitution spells baalism now that's powerful right there when you take away the word God is the word you do away with that then you have to have another form of worship if the word is not the preeminence that's why you've got to have all of the programs everything else because the power and the authority of the word is not upon that church now it's got to go through the through the youth programs and through all of these other programs as as Brother Band would say you know the the the old lady the old lady societies and you've got all of these other things to try to that's their form of worship what we worship is subjection and a love to Jesus Christ the word that's where our love is it's not it's it's not a system it's not a youth program it's not a a Sunday school but it's the word it's the word that we want can you say Amen that is what we worship so so that is powerful I'm going to read it to you again now you just can't have a nickel and setup in the church and not have this other Doctrine come in to you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as the means of worship then you they that worship me was worship me in spirit and truth then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and the substitution spells bism if you're going to understand the doctrine of balum in it uh what it is in the New Testament Church we had better go back and see what it is in the Old Testament Church and apply it to that third age then bring it up to the present the story is found in numbers chapters 22-25 now we know that Israel was chosen the chosen people of God they were the Pentecostals of their day they had taken Refuge under the blood they had been baptized in the Red Sea they come up out of the water singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while miam the prophetess pler tambourine well after a certain time of Journey these children of Israel came to Moab you remember who Moab was he was the son of lot by one of the by one of his own daughters and lot in turn was a nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab were related I want you to see that the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not so Israel came to the border of Moab and sent uh Messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people or our animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for it but the the king but King balac got very excited that head of the nickan bunch was not about to let the church come through with signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky and he might lose some of his crowd so baac refused to let Israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to a hireling prophet called balum and asked him to mediate between him and God and and petition the almighty uh uh petition the almighty to curse Israel and render them impotent and balum being eager to take part in political Affairs become a great man and was only too glad to do so but seeing that he had to uh that he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed as he could not do it by himself he went to God at to ask God if he could have his per mission to go now isn't that just like the nicians we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way when bam asked God for permission to go God turned him down my that stunk but Balo insisted promising him even greater rewards and honor so balam went back to God now one answer from God should have been enough but not for self-will balum when God saw his perversity he told told him to get up and go he and quickly he saddled the donkey and away he went he should have realized that this was simply God's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to curse them if he went 20 times and tried 20 times now like balam are uh now like balum are people today they believe in three Gods get baptized in three titles instead of the name and yet God will send his Spirit upon them as he did upon balum they Will Go On Believing that they are exactly right and here they are exactly perfectly bamit see the doctrine of balam go go ahead anyway do it your way they say well God has blessed us it must be all right I know he has blessed you I don't deny that but it's the same organizational route that balum took it's Defiance to God's word it's false teaching can I hear an amen am so balum went wildly down the road until an angel of God stood in his way but that Prophet Bishop Cardinal chairman president General overseer was so blinded to the spiritual things by the thought of honor and glory and money that he could not see the angel standing with his drawn sword there he stood to to block the Mad Prophet the little donkey saw him and dodged back and forth until he finally crushed Bam's foot against a stone wall and the ass stopped and would not go one he could not so balum jumped off and began beating him the donkey began to talk to balum God let that donkey speak in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid he was the original seed he said to the blinded Prophet I am not or am I not your donkey haven't I carried you Faithfully bam replied yes yes you are my donkey and you have carried me Faithfully until now and if I can't get you going I'm going to kill you whoa what's this talking to a donkey that's funny I thought I heard the donkey talking I was and I was answering it back God has always spoken in a tongue he spoke it at belshazzar's Feast then at Pentecost he is doing it today it's a warning of sooncoming judgment then the angel was made visible to balum he told balum that except for that donkey he would be dead even now for tempting God and when balum promised to go back he sent him uh he sent on with admonition to say only what God gave so balum went down set up seven altars for the clean Beast of sacrifice he killed a ram signifying the coming of the Messiah he knew what to do to approach God uh to to approach into God he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics same as now can't you see nanism there was Israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same things the only one had the signs but only one had the signs following only one had God in their midst uh form won't get you anywhere it can't take the place of spirit manifestation this is what happened at NAA they put over balam's doct not the doctrine of God they stumbled yay they fail and they become dead men after the sacrifice was made baam was ready to prophesy but God tied his tongue up and could not and he could not curse them he blessed them paleo was very angry and there was nothing that balum could do about the prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy Ghost so balam BAC told balum to go down below into the valley and to look into the back parts to see if there wasn't possible Poss possibly some way he could curse them the tactics that Balo used are the same tactics that are used today the big denominations look down at the little groups and anything they find amongst them uh them to make a out a scandal they'll bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin uh no no one says anything about it but let one of the elect get in trouble and every paper blasted across the country every yes Israel had their their back carnal Parts they had their side uh that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock and the Brazen Serpent and the signs and wanders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God God didn't have any respect for these nicians with their phds llds and DDS and all their fine organizations and the best that man could boast but he did have respect un Israel for they had the word Vindicated amongst them certain Israel couldn't look too polished oh certainly Israel couldn't look too polished up just having come out of Egypt in their precipitous flight uh but she was a blast people anyways and she had all she had ever known was three over 300 years of hurting flocks and tending fields and slaving away in the fear of death under the Egyptians but she was now free she was uh a blessed people through the sovereignty of God certainly Moab looked down on her all that n other nations did too organizations always look down on the unorganized and either will by determination bring them into an organization or destroy them when they won't come now someone might ask me brother brandham that makes what makes you think that Moab was organized while Israel was not where did you get that idea I get it right here out of the Bible it is all typed out here everything written in the new in the Old Testament that is in story form is written by for our admonition so that we can learn from it here it is right in numbers 23:9 from the top of the Rocks I see him from the hills I Behold Him Lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the Nations There It Is God looking down from the top of the Rocks not in some Valley looking for their bad points and condemning them God seeing them the way he wanted to see them from the height of love and mercy oh doesn't that make you feel wonderful in all of your mistakes and all of your amen Frailty and yet God in his goodness chooses to see you for who you what the way he wants to see you through love and mercy he says they dwelt alone and they weren't organized they didn't have a king they had a prophet the prophet had God in him by the spirit and the word come to the prophet and the word went to the people they didn't belong to the UN they didn't Belong To The World Council of churches to the Baptist Presbyterian Assemblies of God or any other group they didn't need to belong they were joined to God they didn't need counsel from any counsel they had thus saith the Lord in their midst Hallelujah now in spite of the fact that that balum knew the proper approach to God and could bring forth a revelation from the Lord by the means of special Endo of power he was still for all of that a bishop in the false group for what did he uh for for what did he do now in order to win favor with Bay he formulated a plan wherein God would be forced to deal with Israel in death just as Satan knew that he could beile Eve cause and cause her to fall in fleshly sin thus causing God to pass his pronounced Judgment of death against sin so balum knew that if he could get Israel to sin God would have to deal with them in death so he planned a away to get get them uh to come over and join in sin now I think this is something that we we all need to really really watch as the children of God Amen it doesn't matter what these guys teach and we're fix and we're fixing the seed now remember what was the three things that we mentioned on Wednesday night on or Sunday night amen he invin evil then he anoints the leaders to to teach evil then he anoints the the the preacher to condone evil Satan invin it the world system puts it together and then and and and and and broadcasts it amen just like what we see today and then anoints the church to condone it I don't care what that church out there condones we are a separate people to the Lord Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what laws they pass it doesn't matter what they say the anointing is with the bride and church we've got to keep keep our garments clean amen we've got to keep our garments clean I was talking to you young men the other day and all of you and all of you men but you young men don't get don't get started with that with with with with pornography and and and that kind of nonsense uh in in your life and if you are guilty of that get it under the blood because I don't care if you're the elect or not the elect death will come to your house death will kill you you see well I'm a Son of God yeah yeah yeah but your poor old family is going to m is going to struggle you're going to struggle and you're going to get you're going to you're going to miss out on your purpose here here what God's ordained you to do here on this Earth and you can have a gift of God you can be anointed of God God can have your name in that book but because you're playing with and following for the tricks of what the enemy is doing it'll it'll destroy you can I hear an amen from you Brothers amen so so we want we want to keep that don't get that started you young men if you have got it started amen you need to you need to get an elder and you need to get get that thing exposed don't keep that thing in the dark we don't keep sin in the dark open it up find you somebody that you that that you respect amen and not that not not going to go back there and and and sympathize with you and and and and look at the junk with you but somebody that can pray with you and help you to over come we will We Shall Overcome because God's given it his word we're not like Eve that is that is going to fall for this kind of stuff but yet we can get our garments we can get our garments full of spots we can get our garments with sin we're walking in this evil world but we are not to be a part of it and that's what the blood of Jesus is for y'all hear me amen that's what the blood of Christ is for all right so he says um let's see here amen um so he planned to get them to come over and join in sin he sent out invitations to come to the Feast of uh bpor come over and worship with us now Israel no doubt had seen the Feast of the Egyptians so they did not feel it was too wrong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people what is wrong with Fellowship anyway we're supposed to love them aren't we H how can can we win them being friendly never hurt anyone or else they thought but when they when those sexy moash bysh women begin to dance and undress while they Whirled around doing their little rock and roll and twist the lust rose up in the Israelites and they were drawn into adultery and God in Wrath uh slew 42,000 of them and that is what Constantine and his successors did at Nia and after NAA they invited the people to the convention and when the church sat down to eat and Rose up to play partaking of church form and ceremonies and Pagan Feast named after Christian rights she was trapped she had committed fornication and she walked out and God walked out and when any man turns from the word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he is don't join a church don't get into organization and get uh taken up with Creeds and tradition and anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from God and that's what happened in every age sense God delivers the people they come out by the blood Sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism get filled with the spirit but but while but after a while the first love cools off and somebody gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back into the S Second Generation and sometimes even before then they no longer have the spirit of God just a form of worship they are dead they have hybridized themselves with Creed and form and there is no life in them so balam got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization all fornicators will have their place in the Lake of Fire that is what God thinks of organizations yes sir the and her daughters will be in the Lake of Fire denomination are not of God they never have been never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into hierarchy and Ley and it's therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people that's what organization and denominations do in organizing they separate themselves from the word of God and bring themselves into spiritual adultery now notice that Constantine gave special Feast unto the people uh they were were the old Pagan Feast with new names taken from the church or in some cases Christian rights were taken and abused with Pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the son God and changed it into the Son of God instead of celebrating December 21st which is when they used to celebrate the Feast of the Sun God then they uh they put up December 25th and called it God's birth day son of God's birthday but we know that he was born in April when life comes forth not December they took the feast to a starting and called it the Easter celebrations wherein the Christians is supposed to celebrate the death and the resurrection of the Lord actually it was a pagan Feast to a starting they placed altars in the church put up images uh put in images they gave the people what they called the Apostles Creed though you can't find it in the Bible they taught the people ancestor worship thereby making the Roman Catholic Church the greatest spiritualist uh uh spiritist Church Church in the world every foul bird was in that cage and you have the Protestants with their organizations doing the same thing can you hear say Amen now so so we're going to we're going to stop right there tonight and um I think that was a powerful reading so so here here it is now again I'm bringing this down to families the two Spirits work together okay when you we we we the the nianis is to conquer the Ley the spirit of baalism is to introduce things that's not according to scripture and the two work together you begin to teach so you find somebody that's got the wrong Spirit a controlling spirit then you watch his Doctrine his Doctrine will will will will be of that that is contrary to that of a servant but what we want amen here in py America we want our heart we want to be Servants of the Lord I am a servant to my wife my wife is a servant to me I am a servant to my children amen we are a servant to the community amen so there therefore it is not us up in the air demanding our rights it is it it's there there is something that there is a love that is projected that can only come through the Lord Jesus Christ now do we still have our do we still have our ups and downs we still have our personalities we still have those yes yes yes and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is for the blood is to forgive us to wash us amen not for us to continue going down this we got a backtrack come back up Amen to the to to the to the main trunk of the tree amen man and and and but you can't you can't stay out there on that lamb you've got to come back to what God's called you to do justifying sin will never get you anywhere amen so so we begin Satan will take us off and then he'll start using scripture and start using things for us to justify our sin and you know God knows and the devil knows that sin is still sin it's still sin and we got to take care of sin we're the only people with the pillar of fire we're the only people with the blood of the Covenant we're the only oh come on now God sent a prophet to us to make sure we get it right hallelujah hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen because we're we're we're dummies amen we we'll fall for this and fall for that and fall for this amen and but but remember amen we were ignorant at one time but to be willfully blinded it's it's there's no there's no there's no uh there there's there's no mercy for that yeah you're you're you're past it so don't don't don't balons doctrines balons teachings us condoning things us us us bringing and trying to mix it together will never work can you say amen amen so that that do you uh you you kids you kids understand me amen I want I want to bring it down to where you all can see see it's it's it's it's an organization it's the old churches amen and and and that is true um but but these all start with human beings individuals that want to control and manipulate things and want to bring things according to what they want and God's wanting it even on the playground or when you're with your friends or when you're with your whatever he wants to receive glory in every part of our lives right amen y'all understand amen and so uh that's what we strive to do and and and that's what we want to do we want the blessings of the Lord upon us I want the anointing I want God Amen to so anoint me when I'm when when I no matter where I'm at or what I where what I'm doing I don't want to just join a church amen and and and and and and just sit on a Pew once or twice a month what I I want joy in my heart when I come to church I want I want to I just want to worship Him and love him because I truly do love him amen when I get up in the morning times I want I want the first thing on my lips is Lord Jesus I love you I thank you Jesus I I want everything about me to be him and him alone amen now am I going to make my mistakes oh dear God yes are you going to make your mistakes oh yeah we're we're going to make those mistakes amen but what we do with those mistakes and how we um and and how we we bring those uh correct those mistakes is so important amen amen I I I'm I I I get irritable with my wife I say things that I shouldn't say I you see Israel the only difference between the moabites and Israel Israel had the pillar of fire leading them the blood of the Covenant forgiving them the uh uh uh uh the the the the uh the rod the the uh the the Brazen serpent amen bringing healing to them and the moabites they they they were they they could worship they could do everything baam could do it all amen but he did not have the glory of the Lord there with them we want the glory of the Lord oh Hallelujah I want the glory of the Lord don't how many how many loves waking up in the morning time and then just you wake up and just something says I love you Lord do do you ever do you ever wake up and that happens you just sort of wake up you say I I love you and you think wow and then the devil wants right right right away I'll turn around and say what are you saying that for you what are you're the biggest doofus around but see God chooses to love me God chooses to love you so we're not doing this on the basis of okay all right I got to be good oh God if we just love him and keep the spirit of the Lord you're going to find that you don't want to sin you don't want to sin it's not who you are can you say Amen all right I'm going to open it up real real quick uh for for any who would have um questions or comments that you want to bring bring to this praise the Lord amen this is always the quietest group when it comes to asking questions but then but then as soon as I walk out oh I have I had a question I just didn't want to ask it well I want to go home now so please let me go home I was asking it in church amen so so if you've got I don't mean that I mean it's it's best to ask it in church because somebody else might have might might might be it'll help them too so you have a you have a question amen all right if few musicians would come sure love y'all did you enjoy it [Applause] tonight amen yeah destroy God's plan destroy amen it it is it is and and and we'll read it next week it's it's brother brandom will say just [Music] that U yeah he he'll say it just that let's see I I um [Music] praise the Lord um yeah I don't I don't see that but that is exactly that that that that's exactly the way it is is the um it's it's anything to divert Christianity is not religion it's relationship and and Satan wants to substitute relationship and if he can introduce sin then you and God are separated and so if and and when you introduce sin though you're still going to church and you're doing all of these things uh uh brother brandom says though you're saying you love him your worship is going to Satan because you are keeping those things that he has placed in your heart in your life you're keeping the things that Christ came to set you free from and so relationship is is is So Glorious it's relationship you got those that that that that that that are they're going to look over their shoulders and say ah I heard him he done that last week I heard I seen that last night or they'll keep track of how many times someone goes to church or they'll they'll keep track of of of uh you you'll find that kind of legalism and if they're legalistic to others they're also legalistic to themselves and and and and and and they'll live under that condemnation God yes the Ten Commandments are all in the New Testament Church it's it it it's all been listed at one place or another in the New Testament Church so so you know it was brought brought over it just wasn't brought over okay Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not but the Apostle Paul said let him that stole steal steal stole steal no more let him that you know lied you know there'll be no liar he goes through all of these things so it's part of it but it's not the same as it was in the Old Testament if you do you know and and and it's the dos and the don'ts it's relationship God wants Fellowship go God wants to be honored in your heart and as you love him and you you reflect on him and he's living in you the dos and the don'ts aren't even there anymore it's just I Love You Lord and I'm sorry for that attitude I had earlier I'm it's it's no longer it's no longer you trying to defend your rights or to defend your Fe it's I was wrong your spirit I could feel it Lord I'm sorry Lord help me it's it's as you walk oh God I'm I I'm sorry for that thought I wish I wouldn't have oh God forgive me for looking at that girl or whatever it's not it's not the same as it's love I love you so much Lord and I want to be an expression of you where wherever I go that's what God is doing and Satan as brother Merl says oh he just wants to get in and receive the glory wants to get in receive the and he does get the glory when you're bitter does receive the glory when you're bound he does receive the glory when you're is that right oh I'm so thankful and just think Haven there's there's coming a time really soon where the devil will be totally bound and that old devil will have no more hold on you and you'll be able to love him love the Lord Jesus and there'll be no evil spirits there no evil spirits you'll be able to love him the way you really genuinely want to love him you think it's going to be legalism when you get on the other side do you think you're going to you're going to you're going to oh man I I better stay here for at least another a thousand years at the throne or God just he might not think I love [Music] him do you think [Music] that it'll be love you'll be home he paid the price to bring you back to him there'll be no counting of days there'll be no I I prayed this long and I've done this and I done that I it'll just be love it'll be you and God and there'll be such Divine love coming from the throne and there'll be such gratitude coming from you I I I'm sure it'll just be one eternal love [Music] affair all because God so loved us the devil makes it days and times and do this and don't do that and no we just love him why do I come to church why why is it just bother me when I'm not at church why must I be at church whether I'm sick I I I love him and I want to reflect him I want the world to see I want you to see how much I love him I I don't I I don't want that devil seeing seeing him win in my life in any case I I I he ain't he if I can at all God I I I and it's not just a church but it's everything when when when there's something that rises up and and and tries to hurt my love between a brother and my and and I might and I but you this so flesh might jump up but the but but if but if I'm going to walk with God something will arise up and says you take the humble [Music] seat why because I love God I don't want anything to hurt my relationship between me and him and I don't want anything to hurt my relationship between between me and my brother me and my wife me and my children me and whatever I want there to be a reflection you see what I'm saying oh Jesus I love you that old nickolet and spirit has conquered and divided and that old balum Doctrine has been right there to try to shore it all up amen but we are not ignorant of Satan's devices we are in love with the Lord Jesus Christ you love him you kids understand what I'm saying you kids love him I know he loves you I know he loves you and I know the Lord knows exactly where every one of you are at all of you kids that are here God knows every every thought God knows every every mistake that you make but God also every time that you repent of your sin and you come and ask the Lord genuinely to forgive you and to help you I know the Lord Jesus Christ forgives you of that and he gives you the ability to overcome if you're willing to follow him amen Mam and daddies can can I get a witness from you all you know that to be the truth it's the truth we can't say that we've been perfect but we can say that God's Grace has been perfect we can't say that we've always got it right but we can say that God has never forsaken us God has never let us down his Mercy is just so far beyond me his love is so far beyond me I love him what has this message done it's brought a purity telling you who you are and it's showing you who the devil is oh I feel really good amen praise the Lord I love him with you know when I when when I stop to think about where I've where I've been and and and many times and I I'm sorry I'm trying to I'm trying to shut up but when I when I when I see where I've been in my past and and and the reason I'm I'm I'm I I see

I was there 14 10 9 night and I remember those times that the enemy I know devil told me that I was worthless and that God didn't love me and that I made too many mistakes cuz I was growing up and he tried to convince me that Mom and Dad didn't love me the preacher didn't love me tried to convince me that this that and the other so I know what it's like being raised in a church I know what it's like you know that you're just doing this because of your dad you're just doing this because of your mama you're just doing this because of you're doing this because God loves you God saved your mom and daddy and brought you into a church so that you can experience him that's just the truth and some of you your mama and daddies aren't serving the lord and yet God seen fit God loved you so much that he that that he he went through the back door to come and get you and bring you bring you in so you can have a relationship with [Music] him don't youall ever let this thing be just a old man's gospel well that's that's that's Poppy's gospel well that's just that's just brother wendle that's that's your Jesus Jesus loves you you m and daddies Jesus love you I know I preach to these kids all

you're the pastor you're the bad one out of the entire church if you're the Evangelist you're the one out of the end if you're the Deacon you're the trustee it don't matter where you are you can't get away from it and he wants to try to get you to fall just came to the Lord Jesus Christ well do you love him am I am I yaking too much here at the end sister Stephanie I see you back there now missed you on Sunday amen praise the Lord Paul Amen brother Mitch [Music] bism and all [Music] that with what you said you're talking it's uh that's how he says that they would outshine the elect you know yeah that it's I get the nickel aism the controlling but then there's got to be programs uh excitements going on yeah that will outshine the elect in in deeds and everything else that says it in the church AG it kind of all comes together for me now it's so then that holds the people yeah so it's not so much not it's not the spirit of God anymore doing it you you it's taken you you you are still manipulating the people but you're doing it with the music you're doing it with the with with the program you're you're it's but it's still manipulation it's the it's instead of this Holy Spirit control it is the manipulation of of men to get people to come to the church come to this church instead of that church come to this church instead of right see and and that's that's not what God wants we want the anointing of the holy spirit amen to draw and and and and to bring in that's what separates God's Church from the other churches see you see what I'm saying because it's it's it they they that's the reason why amen the teaching has to be there or or you you you've got your you you've got you've got the doctrine of the nicians you usurping the control by uh um subtracting the word putting man's opinions in then you have to bring in your own form of worship and then with that form of worship then you're forgiving sins in your own manner you're doing things in your own way and then the word of God totally out there's no deliverances there's no power there's no anointing there's no nothing that's why transgenders are accepted reason why homosexuality is accepted that's the reason why that's why the church God is full of cigarette smokers marijuana smokers uh alcoholics and and and all of these things all in the church there's nothing there's there's no difference between any of us because the spirit of God is not there anymore it's become such manipulation of men but I'm so glad that I've belong to the Lord Jesus Christ where the anointing what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of [Music] Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but of Jesus oh precious here the flow that makes me why no other fountain [Music] blood oh for my this [Applause]
