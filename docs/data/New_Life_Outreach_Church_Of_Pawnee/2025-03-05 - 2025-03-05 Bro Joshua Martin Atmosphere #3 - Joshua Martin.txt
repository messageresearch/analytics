as he takes care of me as long as we can trust him we can walk across every wave you know we've said it many times but brother brandom says as long as Peter kept his eyes on Jesus he walked on the waves he walked on the walked on a substance but when he got his eyes off of Jesus and started looking at the circumstances then he started to sink but we can trust Jesus tonight uh every circumstance we go through there's a faith and a confidence on the inside you believe that tonight well if you'd have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Luke 225 I enjoyed the the songs tonight and the specials amen I I trust you've had a good week and uh expecting the Lord to to speak and move tonight amen our pastor and his wife uh went on a little getaway and and just spending some time in prayer and trying to just uh just get recouped up a little bit so he sends his greetings and his love tonight and he says he's praying for praying for the service and everybody here tonight so will you help help me and the family and the church pray for him as you would prayed tonight or in the morning whenever you whenever you do your prayers just remember our pastor and and his wife in in prayer I know the Lord sees everything we go through amen but Luke 2 2 and 25 and the Bible would say behold there was a man in Jerusalem who who whose name was Simeon and the the same man was just and devout waiting on the for the constellation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation amen can we pray here tonight dear heavenly father Lord what a wonderful atmosphere fear we feel here tonight Lord thank you for putting a praise upon our lips Lord and Lord and just working in every one of our Lives father God as we come into this service tonight Lord no doubt we're tired and weary in body father but Lord we have an expectation Lord and of Faith tonight that you can meet our needs Lord and speak to the hearts and the situations we ask that you would speak here tonight father meet the needs Lord touch the hearts Lord we ask that you would just help every one of us to get ourselves out of the way Lord and just enter in for what you have for us tonight in Jesus name amen you may be seated tonight and uh it is good to see brother Joe and sister Stephany here we've been praying for sister Stephanie thankful for what the Lord is is doing for her bringing her through the surgery and everything also good to see Patrick back there it's been a little while so it's good to see him thankful that he's with us also brother Chris that is that has been with us the last few Services it's also been good to good to have him just pray he feels at home and and welcome here but I'm just going to continue on my thought on atmosphere and brother Brandon he would use this scripture many times as he would preach expectations uh uh being led of the spirit he uses it many times and he would say I'm going to use the subject expectation expectations is usually based upon a faith you have to have faith before you can expect anything and now like many other Servants of God in the Old Testament Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and I've often quoted this that God is obligated to his word and I and I like to read just a word or two of it because what I say will fail because I'm a man but what but his word cannot fail because it's God and God has has ever called on the scene at any time to make a decision the first decision God has ever made has to be the same decision every time now there that's where we must solemnly base our faith on thus sayth the Lord You Must Believe it that it is God's word and that's the only hope that we have the only uh uh only hope that we have is on the word of God and now God being infinite cannot make a mistake he's perfect therefore and all of his promises must be perfect as he is perfect and so our expectations is is based upon our faith in the word of God and and I like how brother Brandon was puing it you can't have faith before you you have to have faith before you can expect anything and brother Brandon he would say in expectations he says why are you here for your healing because God had promised that he would do it so before you can enter in and and expect the super natural it always goes back to a promise and and the promise is a a revelation that God is doing it for me that that God promised me a healing God has promised me a a renewing God has promised me a deliverance and for the brand I'm going to talk about Abraham and how God would speak to Abraham and would reveal to him that he was going to have a baby by Sarah and he says that his expectations was not what in the doctor said but what in the promise said then he would bring it down to us and he would say when you take God at his word we have to separate our things from everything that is contrary to that word and then he would say and and I think this is pretty pretty incredible he says you can't go to people and say how do you think about it do you think I can get my healing do you do you think I I can get something from God he says it's not what do they think it's what do you think it's up to you and he goes back to Abraham and says he did so with the Great Expectations of receiving the child so it ain't going to uh to Mama or to Daddy or or to the the neighbor or whatever and saying can God do it for me he says it ain't up to them it's up to you can you believe that God can do it for you can can your expectations line up with the word of God that God can meet the promise that he gave me and that's where we we base our faith is upon th sayth oh Lord not on not on uh man's word or man's ability but it's on the infinite word of God because he cannot make any mistakes and brother Brandon would say there was a question here excuse me here in the scripture and this morning I left off speaking on the word of expectation and to expect and now I trust that you took it home with you and search through the scriptures to find out what to expect and God's word tells us what we can expect and if we receive this word without any doubt mixed into it we will receive what we come for ain't that powerful God's word tells us what we can expect so whatever the word tells us we can expect God to meet that promise you know and brother brandham says and if we receive this word without any doubt so if we look at the word and get an expectation and not add any of our doubt to it just keep it to God's word then we can get what we expect and the Bible would tell us we look at not things that are seen but things that are not that are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal that's what I want I I don't want Corporal things and and fancy things on the earth I want the spiritual blessings of God like I would like we was preaching on Sunday we don't want just the blessings of God we want the spiritual blessings of God and we're thankful for a a nice building we're thankful for electricity we're we're thankful that we got running water here but I want the spiritual blessings of God whatever he promised in the word of God but he didn't promise that we would have electricity he didn't promise that we would have a nice warm building that we can come into but he did promise where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in your midst so we're not expecting the blessings of God because many times we get discouraged when we don't see blessings of God we where we don't maybe not have the money to meet the bills and we get discouraged because we don't see the blessings of God but if the spiritual blessings of God are there that's where our expectation is at you know I want to see the B the spiritual blessings of God and and the Bible would tell us that our faith it's our faith that pleases God so I believe before we can we can ever ask anything of God our faith has to produce an expectation that when I do ask God he's going to meet it you see we're not just coming to and at prayer meetings and and coming to church and to saying God I hope you do something and in the back of our mind knowing he's not going to do it but but because we believe he can do it our expectation is when I come to a prayer meeting I know God is going to meet my need when when I come to a Wednesday night service I know God is going to meet my need if if I'm needing to be encouraged I've got an expectation from the word of God that he promised me if I get in the right atmosphere he will fulfill his word and we know that we we get our faith by the word of God and brother Brandon would tell us that the the word of God was given to his church to defeat the world and the Devils the sicknesses and to cast out Devils no con no denomination was given to the church the the word was given to the church that is her strength and what is the denomination a a type of a type of law type of Works a program something you can do to work your way to heaven but that's not what God gave us to earn the favor of God he gave us his word and our faith in the word puts us in a position that the favor of God can rest upon New Life Outreach that the favor of God can rest on our marriages and the favor of God can rest on our young people and things so we're not trying to earn the favor of God because we'll never earn the favor of God we'll never be good enough for the the spiritual blessings of God but it comes back to our faith that's what puts us in a position to see the Miracles of God and you remember them the the man in the Bible that had a son that was possessed by a devil and and and it's a it's a sad situation cuz the Bible would tell us that the this boy had a spirit upon him and the spirit would throw him into the fire throw him into the water and and it's incredible what this what this father would say he would say if you can only have compassion on us and help us and then Jesus would look at him and would say if you can't believe all things are possible if you can only believe look at the sincerity of this man he will look at him and say I do believe but help my unbelief you see whenever he looked at Jesus and it would say just have compassion on me Jesus going to look at him and say well if you can just do this if you can just do that if you can live a good life if you can do that then I will have compassion on you he looked at him and said if you can only believe not the works that you can do not good not not how how loud you can shout not not how loud you can sing but if you can have faith in what I can do then the power can be released to you and what I love about it is is brother Brandon would tell us that that the compassion of God is Not Human sympathy right you remember whenever Jesus would go to the man had the pull up Bethesda G brother Brandon would say you would think that Jesus a man of compassion would have stopped for everybody else too and would heal their diseases and brother brandham says many people mistake compassion for human sympathy syy he says compassion is not human sympathy it's the will of the father and so here this man would look the Jesus and would say give me some sympathy you know just feel sorry for me and Jesus wasn't looking at him and feeling sorry for him he knew that the will of the father was for that boy to be set free and I don't believe God is looking at us with sympathy and saying oh man I hope they can make it I hope they're good enough I hope they can overcome on their life I hope they're going to make a Rapture he has not given us sympathy he has given us the word of God to perform the will of God oh Hallelujah God is now looking and saying I hope you can be good enough he says I know you can be good enough if you can only believe the word that I have given you and expect for big things expect for the Rapture expect the body change you see it was Jesus looking at that man and saying if you can only believe and I believe it's only through our faith do we gain the favor of God and brother brandom or Peter would tell us in Acts 10:44 while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them when which heard the word and so while Peter was preaching the Holy Ghost would fall on them which heard the word so they had nothing to do with it they was just sitting there and as the word would come forth they would receive that word then that would bring the Fulfillment of prophet phy that would bring the Fulfillment that in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh there were setting in a position and when the strength would come over them they would grab that strength and bring prophecy out of the Old Testament into reality and I believe that the strength of the church is still the word of God and every time the strength comes across your situation you're reaching out and pulling it out of the Bible pulling it out of the 60s pulling it out of the 50s into a reality and see I can be the Fulfillment of the promise that God has given us oh Hallelujah CU I want to be the Fulfillment you know I I don't want to just come to church and and you know put on a nice suit and C my hair and and do these things and never have the favor of God I want the favor of God in every aspect of my life in in my prayer life I want the favor of God when I study I want the favor of God when I worship I want the favor of God I don't want motions I don't want Traditions I want the favor of God to come with my expectation and see the promises of God fulfilled in every one of our lives and you see brother Brandon would say everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there and going to meet everything that they have need of something will go to taking place he says atmosphere but that's the hardest thing to do is to get the people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing how come that's the hardest thing to do because once you get in the atmosphere of believing expectations start to build once you get in that atmosphere of believing expectations is no longer a hope so it's a no so it's no longer I'm hoping God is going to meet us at Youth Camp it's a no so that if I can just get in the presence of God my expectation is going to pull my blessing to reality ity and brother Brandon would talk about Simeon and would say that it was promised by the holy ghost that Simeon was going to see the Lord before he had died and and it's so incredible how brother Brandon would put it he says God had a reason to reveal it and then Simeon had a right to expect it ain't that powerful once it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost then he had a right to expect it you see it ain't the compassion of God to pour our blessings upon us it's all right to get the spiritual blessings of God cuz he promised it to me you see it ain't the sympathy of God saying okay I guess I'm going to let your children be on fire with the Holy Ghost no he promised it to me and I've got a right to expect it I've got a right to see the Holy Ghost fall upon my children I've got a right to expect the Holy Ghost to walk through the pews and down the AIS I've got a right to do it because God has promised me that it can be that way oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would tell us and than that the Holy Spirit can lead man and tell him things and make him act different and make him believe things and receive things that the world could never believe could happen I'm a witness I once was blind myself and he says practically how to be led so I know what I'm talking about that's the Holy Spirit and if you oh if you can just feel that Paul ation of the spirit begin to rise in your heart saying Jesus Christ is in our midst whether wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the midst he says pulsations something moving like a heartbeat it's pumping energy into your spirit pumping energy into your mind then let the things that your eyes see black out and then let the things that are of the world you're believing what God said he says once the Holy Spirit comes and starts to reveal to you and lead you then there's a pulsation that starts to be inside of your chest that the world knows nothing about then the things that you do see start to black out that all you see is the spiritual blessings of God oh come on now we're now looking at natural situations and saying I hope God can move I hope God can move but there's a pulation on the inside that is blacking out all of the natural circumstances and all I see is the promises of God that he promised that I can have oh my I say little church it's time to get in a pulsation of Faith where all we see we don't see troubles we don't see circumstances we don't see failures we don't see condemnation but all we see is the promises of God that he promised that I can have I'm not looking at mistakes I'm not looking at problems I'm looking at a promise that he gave me that I can see the Supernatural is is that's your expectation tonight if he promised me it I am expecting it Hallelujah I'm expecting it it's the Holy Spirit leading man and telling him things that he can have and the Bible would tell us that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and you see brother Brandon would tell us that that's the whole of the Christian experience the Christian life is getting in the spirit and he says that's what would bring the Visions onto John was getting in the spirit John would say I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I Heard a Voice say I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end so once he got into the spirit brother the Brandon would tell us that he got into the spirit and was transported into the Lord's day and then he heard that voice I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end so once uh once John was transported then he would have an expectation that he is the beginning and the end ending and I think that is so incredible that he did not just say the beginning and the ending but he said there's an end in between so the one that has started your journey is going to finish your journey but also in between in between the the the starting line and the Finish Line I am going to be there and you can expect me to be in every Avenue of your life you can expect me to be in the hard times you can expect me to be in the trials you can expect me when you hit rock you can expect me because in the spirit I told you this would happen oh hallelujah we're not making stuff up we're getting into the spirit and the Lord is revealing to me what he is to me oh my like like brother Brandon was saying we're not going to everybody else and saying can God do it for me we know God can do it and so when when John got into the spirit he didn't go to the other the other the prisoners and the inmates and saying what do you think do you think he's the beginning and the ending do you think he's the Alpha and the Omega he didn't care what they said the spirit told him that he was the Alpha and the Omega I don't care what you got to say the word told me where two or three are gathered in my name I would be in their midst and I am expecting on a Wednesday night service that the Holy Ghost can fall and walk the ows walk the pews renew with the Holy Ghost encourage the ones that are discouraged take take away condemnation come to a young person that is fighting peer pressure if you can expect it for you you can have it oh Hallelujah this ain't just a Gathering Place this is a place where Miracles can happen this ain't just a just a Tavern that we come to three times a week this is a place where the supernatural can fall and change lives I still believe that that there's still a holy ghost that can burn out sin that can burn out and bring a Deliverance like never before we're not just coming here out of a tradition there's an expectation on the inside of our life that I'm going to see God not a god of yesterday but I'm seeing a god of today I'm expecting it I'm going to receive it I'm going to see it the spirit told me I can have it oh Hallelujah the spirit told me I could have it oh man not a man but the spirit and brother Brandon would tell us he says talking about John he says his Spirit got on the prophet then he be to see things and he says you'll go to seeing things when you get in the spirit oh my when John got into the spirit he begin to see things that ain't just for a prophet but he says once you get into the spirit you'll start to see things and I don't believe we're going to imagine things but we're going to see things and I don't necessarily believe that this is just spiritually but I believe it can happen naturally that once you get into the spirit on a church service at home wherever you are at you can see things change naturally you can see your home life begin to change you can see rebellious teenagers that rebellious and start to break off their life it's you getting into the spirit and start to see changes take place I want to see changes in my life don't you you want to see changes in your life you want to see changes in your family life get into the spirit of it get into the spirit then you'll start to see things happen oh Hallelujah then you'll start to see things happen that this ain't just an imagination but it's a reality but it's getting into the spirit of it then you're led to believe these things you see we're led to it where the brandom says we're Lambs right we're sheep we can only Follow by something that is leading us said brother Brandon he would preach a leadership I believe and he would say that whenever you're born he said says you're you're led by a mama and he says you're LED for a little bit then you're handed over to a school teacher right and he says the school teacher lead you through school and then he says then if you're a man you're LED back to your father and he teaches you business right and he says but if you're a girl you're you're handed back to your mother and she teaches you how to be a housewife and things but then he stops and he says but who's leading you now you see something is going to lead you your your emotions are going to lead you condemnation is going to lead you your failures is going to lead you or the spirit can lead you and show you things that can take place in your life oh hallelujah it's getting into the spirit of and I was listening uh to a to a message today and and and I've heard the story of anel Mama so many times but the but today just struck struck different to me I'm sitting there on the couch and I I start to weep listening to it because it's incredible that this Angel mama had a need she knew that that only God could save her son and what's incredible is her son is dying because of it because of things he done you know it's not like he's a Christian boy and and he's going to church and and something just happens but he's sitting there in his sins in his addictions in his own mistakes and yet this Aunt your mama knew if I could just get in the presence of God my boy can not only be healed but he can be saved and while this is going on you know brother the Brandon was tell us that that he's in Memphis and he's he has to make a flight has to catch a flight and he had some mail that he was going to go drop off and deliver at the post office and brother brandom says while he's going something is telling him to keep going on and he's preaching on being led of the spirit that's what that's what message it was he's saiding he's walking and the voice says keep on walking Keep On Walking but the brandom says where I don't know where I'm going I'm just going to keep walking and he stops and he says the voice told him turn around and go that way and he thought well maybe maybe I'm I'm just hearing things but then he heard it again turn around and go that way little did Brother brandham know that there was an an Mama that was in the spirit and the spirit would would begin to show her things you see the promise of God could not help but come to that ant Jam Mama because the spirit of God already showed her it was on the way cuz you remember what would happened he would walk up to the to a fence and and an your mama would say morning paron and and she would he would look and would say how do you know me well I I was praying last night and then I would go to sleep and he said and she would say I had a dream and I had a dream that you would have a a certain Overcoat on you would have this hat on and in that dream you would come by my way and I said and she said I'm the sh ofite woman you're my Elijah so now brother Brandon would know what's going on in a dream at 3:00 in the morning while brother Brandon was asleep God gave her a promise that he was going to come by her way and meet her expectation so once she got the promise she got up in the middle of the night and was expecting it brother brandom say she had do on her back she was wet cuz she was waiting there all night it was somebody that would get in the spirit and the spirit would show her things that she could have but she didn't just stop there and say thank you Lord for it but she got into action and says I'm expecting it I'm going to sit here here until God fulfills his promise to me and little church once you get into the spirit and God reveals to you that you can have a Revival don't you say Thank You Lord and go back home it's time to get into action and say I'm going to press for it I'm going to fight for it I'm not giving up any inch of ground but if God told me I can have these things I'm going to have it and little church I say your answer is on the way your Revival is on the way a renewing a refilling is on the way oh don't give up in the middle of the night don't give up when it's hard don't give up when it don't seem like God is answering the prayer but if God promised it to you you can have it yes sir oh Hallelujah and here would come brother brandom and brother brandom says he would tell her I'm a Healer I I preach Divine Healing and brother brandom say she didn't care about that she said come in with me he didn't tell me you was a divine here I don't know all he told me is if you would come here God would raise up my boy and what is so incredible is brother brandom says he would walk into the home and he would SE a sign God bless this home and he says I've been in palaces I've been in mansions but this was the most welcoming place I have ever been in and brother brandham says that she begin to pray oh Hallelujah brother brandom says he knew that she had prayed before and she sitting there praying and interceding then he then she stops and says okay now you pray and why would brother Brandon pray brother Brandon brother Brandon would then would say this I said I will pray now now auntie I put my hands over on his feet and I said Lord I don't know what to say is this why you made me miss my plane to come here to pray for This Woman's boy if it is oh Lord let it be known that you're God and you respect her prayers so it wasn't brother brandom's prayer that would bring her Deliverance it was her Prayer by her faith that would bring an expectation you don't need a profit here you need an expectation by the word of God that you can see Miracles that you can see the miraculous that you can see a Revival that you can have a refilling that you can have a renewing then God will honor your prayer he'll honor your sincerity if you're willing to expect big things we're not coming here out of traditions we're coming here to expect big things I want to see the fire of God flow through New Life Outreach I want to see a fire of God come and encourage you deliver you sanctify you fill you with the Holy Ghost I want to see these things but do you want to see them come on now do you want to see these things if you want to see them you can have them come on now if you want to see them you can have them and brother Brandon he would say this here he says brother Brandon he he would say the same Holy Ghost has led you here tonight so the same holy ghost that would bring uh that that would lead the shoot of the lead the the theel mama he says has led you here tonight ain't that powerful that the same God that would ground a plane not only ground the plane but would keep that plane in a perfect time set time matter that when brother brandom says once he got to that plane he says they were boarding the last boarding call like ain't that incredible that not only did he ground it but he calculated the time it would take for him to pray for that boy to come back to the airport get through security all of this thing all of these things was estimated by the plan of God that when he would get there he would they would be saying this is the last boarding call and I don't think anything happened by accident everything that has happened today has been planned by God that you would be here at a pred destinated Moment In Time the God can meet your expectation Hallelujah the God can meet your expectation Hallelujah brother brandom says this and now right right after that he says now father God we realize that that that that that talking is one thing and speaking of a God is one thing but when the same God when that same God would come and manifest that he is alive he said sitting there tell them a testimony of the the s j mama and then would say talking about you is one thing but we want you to come here and manifest that you're alive that the same God that did that for her you can do that here today and then then then I was listening to another tape and I know this is simple things tonight but but I was listening to a to a message and brother brandom talks about the blind girl that lost her daddy and I'm telling you man the these stories were hidden home cuz I cuz I've been thinking on these things though we can see the Supernatural and I'm sing I'm listening to it and brother brandom says he he just got out of the ambulance right he he just healed the the the the mama inside of the inside of the ambulance and he's working his way trying to get back into the building and and he's pushing and and it's so funny because brother brandom says he's pushing and one guy says hey stop shoving brother brandom said he pushes again and he says I said stop shoving and brother brandom says he was whittling with a knife and he said oh I'm sorry sir excuse me and so why one was in a bad attitude you know then here would come a girl saying Daddy or I think it was daddy daddy where are you daddy daddy where are you and what is so powerful is brother brandom looked at her and says oh man I hope somebody would help her and and she kept on saying Daddy Daddy and then he stopped well then he said maybe I can help her and he says maybe God will heal her and you know what brother brandom says that he done he says he started to work her way work his way to that little girl cuz she was still working her way through the crowd brother brandom says wherever she went he would position himself that she would bump into him oh come on now it wasn't by accident he was watching that little girl wherever she would go he would go if she would move this way he would go that way if she went back this way until they bumped into each other and God has been following you all the days of your life waiting for you to bump into him oh and I say we're in Heavenly places tonight I think you bump into him whatever your need is whatever your expectation is the almighty god Jehovah Gyra is walking in the building he's bumping into you oh you know what the little girl would do she would say Excuse me sir I'm trying to find my daddy and he would say what are you doing here where are you from and I love this part of the story he would ask her where were you from she would say I'm from Memphis but the brandom says he looked and seen the buses from Memphis he says I could have got her there easy but I kept talking to her saying why are you here she says I'm here to see the Healer and he says well the Healer you don't believe that stuff and she said oh yeah I heard on the radio that there was a man healed a blind man that was healed and he read it in the scripture that really stood out to me she wasn't just taken a man's word but there was a scriptural expectation to produce a faith and she said I'm trying to get to the Healer brother brandom says Nah you don't believe that we we're living in a scientific age don't you think the doctors could help you and she says sir I've went to all the doctors none of them can help me and he says I'm testing her faith said are you sure this could happen and she says I tell you what sir you give me to the Healer I found my own daddy she didn't care what she had to do there was an expectation that says if I could just bump in to the almighty God I can see my neede met little church what is your expectation are you expecting to bump into God if you are grab a hold of him cuz what would brother brandom say brother brandom say she he looked at her and says well I might be him and he and she says he she grabbed a hold of his coat and would not let him go and she says sir I'm not letting you go and he says I'm not the Healer but I preach Divine Healing and he said she says oh I believe it and I love it cuz brother brandom says can you just let go of me so I can so I can grab your hand and see the vibrations she says I ain't letting go of you and he said okay grab me with your left hand I'll grab your right hand so she says okay it was somebody that realized I'm in a position to see the miraculous I'm in the position Jacob you're in a position tonight wrestle it out with that angel if you got a hold of the supernatural tonight don't let go go pull pull out your renewing pour out your expectation and it's so incredible because brother Brandon would say that he will look at her and say okay b b bow your eye bow your head and don't make a sh you know bow your head she would bow her head and she and brother brownon would put it back on her and he would say as soon as your faith matches my faith he says open your eyes and she sitting there with her eyes closed her head bow and she says I feel something cool and he says okay in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I give you your healing she would open her eyes and she would say wow is that light is that this is that people it was her faith brother Brown I'm letting you know that even if I am not here if your faith can match God's expectation his promise you can see the miraculous brother Brandon says she opened her eyes and says I once was blind but now I see could you imagine she probably heard that story all of her life and the expectation was building and she probably had it in her mind that one day I'm going to say those same words one day I'm going to open my eyes and say I am blind I was blind but now I see but all of a sudden her wishes her hopes her expectations would be brought into reality that she could say I once was blind but now I see brother brand says she would go dancing off and then he start started to run brother brandom says everybody now was looking at him so he takes off running trying to get back into the building but he says there was a man that would say brother brandom I know who you are I've been standing here in the rain for eight days and he says look at my foot brother brandom says his foot was a club foot had no no no Toes or nothing and he looked at it and the man you know what the man would say he says tell me what I must do tell me what I must do and then I know you can speak the word then I could be made well you know what brother Brandon would say Do you believe it he says I believe it then he says you can be made well and that man would go dancing off but the brandom didn't stop and said you got to do a certain thing you got you got to do this you got to do that but he says if you can only believe then you can see the supernatural you see we don't got to work something up we don't got to come here and and play some fancy keys and and some fancy drum RS in order for God to come all we got to do is have an expectation Hallelujah it was their expectation that would say if I could just get into it and get into the presence of God brother brownon would say this that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law of by a law and that law was is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith and Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours whatever God will lead your soul to believe that's what happens when we get in Heavenly places we start to believe these things we start to get led to these things that wow I can actually have these things that these ain't MTH these ain't imaginations brother Brandon would say in one place I want to tell you something else work on the pulsation the spare of the moment like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene did all those just that moment when something ISS revealed to you grab it and hold to it you see that's what happens in an atmosphere of believing when the preacher starts to preach the seeds starts to preach the word it falls into your ground and a pulation starts to rise up it starts to beat and brother brandom says in that moment when it's revealed to you grab a hold of it and don't let it go I believe that happened with you sister CA right you was having some troubles in in your body you thinking and and our pastor was telling her whenever a pulsation rise up when when the spirit of God will begin to move and brother Miguel was preaching I believe and something would start to transpire and she would come up and get prayed for and God would heal her body that's a witness of the pulsation of faith that whenever you get in Heavenly places and the word of God is bringing up expectations you act upon it you don't just sit there and say ah I'm going to get at a youth camp I'm going to get it at that our meetings I'm going to get it if a my favorite preacher is here but as soon as you're led to believe it act upon it and say God I'm going to receive my expectation oh Hallelujah if you're wanting a Revival as soon as you're led to believe it act upon it and say God I'm going to receive it Hallelujah you see brother Brandon in the Patmos vision would would say suppose you need healing he says what does the word say he says well we have read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for his Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the Elders confess their sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but get this part but in his Spirit it is all over there was no other court of appeal God will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit then things will be done you see he looked at it in the church a but he's saying if you need healing you got to read the scripture but you in order to see the results you got to get in the spirit of it so once you get in the spirit of it it reveals to you the truth of what the scripture says oh Hallelujah that's why it's important to get into the right atmosphere cuz we don't want to just hear ser don't want to just hear hear messages and and scriptures being read we want the spirit to bring to us what it really means cuz then once that happens a connection happens and he says it might not happen right away but in the spirit it's all over with in that other dimension it's all over with and now our confession is bringing our body into subjection oh come on now our soul is resting in Heavenly places our soul is resting we're sealed to the day of our Redemption but our body has got to be brought into subjection so when our soul is being led to believe the promises our confession is lining up with our soul and bringing our body into subjection come on now when your body don't feel like worshiping the Lord your your your soul that is being led brings it into subjection and says I'm going to praise the Lord when you don't feel like entering into the service your soul that is being led to believe brings your body into subjection when you don't feel like you're you're getting any better that Soul brings it into subjection and it starts to bring the the results that is in the spirit hallelujah oh I think God is so powerful that even if you don't see anything happening now in the spirit it's all done so all you're doing is bringing your body into subjection that's why we got to we throw away all of our negative confession cuz our negative confession don't line up with the spirit you see it's our soul bringing getting into subjection brother Brandon would say that Abraham was seeking after a city whose Builder and maker was God because God made him a promise he was expecting it and I won't hold you much longer tonight brother Brandon would say this now I know I'm doing a lot of reading tonight brother Brandon would say this but before there can be a creation there has to be a Creator and before the creation and he say as long as he's revealed it there's a fountain open somewhere he says oh if we can just see it there's a fountain open somewhere for it's revealed to you by the Holy Ghost God Is A Healer where's his fountain at God fills with the Holy Ghost where's that fountain at see there's a fountain now or you would not have a craving in your heart M and he says if there's a desire for these things there's a fountain fountain flowing of it somewhere but where's it at oh I say we're not looking somewhere else but it's right here wherever the word is being preached that is the fountain that is the Fountain of the Holy Ghost that can come and meet that expectation brother Brandon would say oh my how can you take it back and put in some historical thing the promis is unto you to your children to them that is a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call Pentecostal blessings the power of God is trying to take his church he doesn't fail he doesn't diminish he is just as bright and fresh today as he ever was and it will always be he is eternal he says don't put it back in the history books but he is fresh and real today and God is trying to get his blessings into the church he's trying to get it into you if you're willing to to accept it and you see brother Brandon would tell us in one place as as much fast much Faith you can release is much power that you have so whatever faith that you can release in expectation is what you can have and brother Brandon would talk about Anna the blind woman and and in the message expectation he's talking about Anna a and Simeon and he says this old woman Anna was blind and he says there was Simeon he was old and he brother Bram says he was kind of half off in his head you know and he says both of these people was being led by the Holy Spirit both of them was being brother brandom says that that this woman Anna was blind but he says no matter her condition she was standing at the right place because she was being led of the spirit right Hallelujah it did not matter her condition brother brandom says she was blind but she was being led by the spirit and was leading her through the crowd leading her through this part of the part of the crowd leading her through this and brother bam says she was winding her way through there and he says now if the Holy Ghost could wind that open blind woman around all those people to get to him how much more can he R wind you around these streets tonight coming down to get to a spot where we believe that he can heal the sick he will save the lost brother Brandon would say that that that blind woman was working her way through the crowd because she was expecting him to come since she was expecting him to come the spir the Holy Ghost would start to lead her would start to direct her and it see but the brown he he would talk about about non and he would say that there was a little servant girl that non had and and she had seen that non had leprosy a a and what what I think is so powerful is brother brandom says she was conducting herself as a Believer and she would look at non brother brandom says she had a love for non this this was her master and he she would see that he would have leprosy and she would say only if he was in my home country there's a prophet and there's a God that can heal him but the brand would say that Elisha had never healed leprosy before but she believed that he could do it so even though she had not seen this miracle before she was still conducting herself as a Believer oh Hallelujah you know what brother brandom says that what brought this on she was raised in a home under the influence of almighty God and he says that influence he would say this he said inspiration from that atmosphere leted her to say those words so the atmosphere of the the influence of the atmosphere she was leaving in would lead her to say these words that if he can only get into my home country God can make him well even though I have never seen a done before and oh man even if we think it's impossible to see the miraculous the influence of that atmosphere leads our confession that by his stripes I am healed it leads our confession that I'm going to see the Holy Ghost for my children the promises unto me and my children as many as the Lord Our God shall call the influence of that atmosphere is n moding My Confession oh how you see that's what happens that's what will stop on the backbiting is getting under the influence of his atmosphere then are we're being led a different direction with our mouth or our expectations is being led a different direction it's getting under an influence getting under that influence then God starts to lead us hallelujah and even though she was alienated and what I think is so incredible is here he would start to the prophet would come you know and and he the prophet would tell him he's got to dip dip seven times in the Jordan so even though that that that that uh uh her expectation brought brought the the the miracle to his doorstep he had something to do and many times I know as a as a pastor's kid I thought it was all of my parents right how many's ever thought that you rais up in church man dad's a preacher he's a pastor uncles are preachers and pastors I've got nothing to do but even though I come to church and God is here I still got a dip in the Jordan right I still got a dip in the muddy river and here here non was like man I don't think I can do it but there was this little girl this little girl was conducting herself as a Believer saying if you would just follow the words of the Prophet you can may be made well and little church if we can just follow the words of our Prophet that says expect big things we can be made well for the brandist say so they had a little girl there now I want to show you the force of a testimony of a child who lived in a nation or perhaps a family who was under the influence of God brother brandom says look at the force of her testimony a young girl but look at the force of it since she was under an influence that influence would bring forth a force and young girls your influence can bring forth a force for the influence of the Holy Ghost can come in young young boys and teenagers and bring forth such a force that you're a power house upon the Earth brother Brandon would say that a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him that's for you that's your promise that's your reality that can be your expectation if you're willing to get under that influence then there's a force that starts to work through your testimony you know brother Brandon would say that Samson never went to the line and says I'm going to tear you apart until the spirit of God Came Upon him then he says then that's what he done and he says if you got something wrong tonight feel the spirit of God moving on you and tear that thing apart oh come on now that's what we need to start doing a new life Outreach is when we feel the spirit of God the the that the bitterness and and the discouragement and the high blood pressure all of those things that is wrong with us we start to tear it apart oh Hallelujah condemnation that comes against us we tear it apart bitterness heart feelings all of these things that comes against us we start to tear it apart and what the devil meant for evil God turns it for good and gives you a force of a testimony the devil don't realize that every time he trips you up and puts condemnation upon you if you're a Son of God you're going to get back up and that's another force of a testimony so what the devil means for evil God turns around for good and I'm going to bring this to close on this point here and and brother brand talking about Simeon but talk about him and said he was over in the temple and he says all all of them wom with all the ladies were lined up to you know to to their to do their thing there to go into the temple and brother branam says then God would speak to him and would say start walking and he would say where to and he says it don't make no difference start walking brother brandham says he says walk he says do you believe Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit he says here then start walking he says where am I going it don't make any difference just keep walking now sometimes we get tired we get weary we get beat down and we don't feel like walking but keep on walking there there there there're Simon brother brandom says he was teased he had one he had he had one foot in the grave the other foot was halfway in the grave but as soon as God would say start walking he was under expectation and would say I'm going to keep walking even though I made fun of even though it might have been let down even though maybe I haven't seen it in all of these years of my expectation if God has told me to walk I'm going to keep on walking and brother Brown the Bible would tell us that that Simeon would say my eyes have seen thy salvation not my salvation thy salvation so there once he started walking the spirit would lead him to his expectation little church Keep On Walking you might not know how the outcome's going to be brother Brandon would say in expectation he says how am I going to get out of the stretcher he says I don't know just keep walking he says he would take the take he would take care of the rest he says how am I going to get out of the wheelchair he says just keep on walking he says I don't know how am I going to get healed of cancer he says I don't know keep on walking how am I going to get healed of heart trouble I don't know just keep on walking how am I going to tell them my mother if I get the Holy Ghost and my daddy they belong to a different Church Church they don't just they don't get it you see don't worry about it he will take care of it how will I face my school and my placemates my Playmates don't worry about it just keep on going in other words don't worry about it just be led of the spirit and keep on walking you see CU brother Bram says if you if you if you stop walking he says you're not going to go anywhere but if you keep walking he will take care of the rest he would talk about how he says I've been been in the ministry a long time and he says I've been in this great battle and he says I've had some awful obstacles I've been over some hard roads he says I've been through some hard things but he says I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world and he says here is my greatest victories my greatest Pleasures I had is when I come up against something that I cannot see see over around it and under it and I just keep on walking oh Hallelujah I just keep on walking towards it and believing this the God Will Make A Way when I get there and he says I've never come this far and he says all all the distance that I have come I have trusted him and he has never failed me little church we've come too far to end up in discouragement New Life hour reach has come too far to turn around and to fall apart now you see your marriages have come too far to fall apart now young people you fought too many peer pressures and complexes and insecurities to give up now keep on walking masas you fought too hard to quit walking now come on now preachers you fought too hard the to stop now and turn around keep on walking I don't know how it's going to work I don't know how I'm going to get out of this discouragement I don't know how I don't know how I'm going to get out get out of these mind battles keep on walking and let God take care of the rest let our musicians come tonight Hallelujah just keep on walking remember brother brownon would talk about Lake Erie and would say the lake was having a Revival and it was going back and forth back and forth and what was it doing it was pushing out the trash pushing out the trash CU as long as it was moving the trash couldn't stay there come on now you see if it was if it got still and stagnated then trash was coming in instead of going out but once it started moving then the trash was no longer coming in but it was going out now and sometimes we get to that point I've been there I'm sure all of us can testify that we've all been there we get discouraged condemnation starts to wear us down that that we're we're no good for nothing we're you we'll never amount to anything we will never do anything for God I can never do anything for him and then we sit still and we stop moving and then this starts coming in this thing starts coming in that starts coming and all we see is the mistake akes is the failures as our past all we see are these things but don't worry if you can just keep walking if you can just keep moving then those things that came in will start to go out that's why we preach the promises of God when you're discouraged when we're when I'm discouraged because if I we can show you the light brother Brown must say just keep walking in the light of his promises the Bible would say in Isaiah 588 then shall thy light Break Forth as the morning and thy hell shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee and the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward and he says Thou shalt call and the Lord shall answer Thou shalt cry and he shall say here am I if thou take away from the midst of Thee the oak that pth forth of you of the finger and speaketh vanity and I just love that thy light shall Break Forth as the morning your health shall come back unto thee and the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward and I say you might have clouds over you right now but the light is breaking through the light is breaking through for New Life Outreach the light is breaking through for momies and for daddies and for teenagers and for preachers the light is breaking through and if the light could only break through what is my reward the glory of God brother brandom says the glory of the Lord is his presence Hallelujah that's our reward for for for fighting and and and for pressing in is the presence of God CU sometimes we just don't feel the presence of God anymore sometimes we get dried up we we we start we like I when I go to study sometimes I don't feel the presence of God but if I can just keep walking the light is going to break through my clouds that once that light breaks through the clouds my reward for walking is his glory is his presence is a renewing of the Holy Ghost is a refilling is a Revival but you just got to keep Keep On Walking let's bow our heads tonight maybe you'd want to lift up a hand and say brother Josh I want to keep on walking I've come too far to stop now I've come too far to get muddled down in discouragement I've come too far to lay down in defeat I've come too far to let the devil bring my mind down I've come too far to let the devil turn me around but I'm going to keep on walking dear heavenly father you see the hands that are lifted up in this building Lord Lord
