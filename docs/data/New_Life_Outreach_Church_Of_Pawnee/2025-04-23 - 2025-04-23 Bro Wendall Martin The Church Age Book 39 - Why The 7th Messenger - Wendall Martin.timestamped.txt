[7:21] We have a a couple written prayer
[7:22] requests here. If brother Harry wants to
[7:25] make his way up
[7:26] here. Says,
[7:30] uh, "Coming,
[7:32] family. They buried Donna in Wyoming on
[7:36] Monday." It says, "Pray the
[7:39] Lord to make a way for me to go to
[7:42] Virginia to brother Sea's.
[7:45] Pray for pressure in my eye. Devil is
[7:49] still a loser. It's just a
[7:57] carol. Let's all bow our
[8:01] heads. Lord Jesus, we come into your
[8:03] presence this evening, Lord. Lord, we
[8:05] just thank you for allowing us to gather
[8:07] once again, Lord Jesus. We thank you for
[8:10] traveling mercies to get here, Lord. We
[8:12] thank you for the blessings of a
[8:13] building to gather, Lord Jesus. We thank
[8:16] you for cars that allow us to drive here
[8:19] and all the the different things, Lord,
[8:21] that that maybe we don't think about now
[8:23] and then, Lord. But Lord, we just thank
[8:25] you for the blessings that you
[8:27] continually rain down on us, Lord Jesus.
[8:30] For all those little things that maybe
[8:31] we don't pay attention to, Lord. We just
[8:33] want to to praise you and and and lift
[8:35] your name for everything that you've
[8:37] done for us, Lord Jesus. Lord, we lift
[8:39] before you these requests that Sister
[8:41] Carol has brought. Lord, for the family
[8:44] that just buried loved one in Wyoming,
[8:47] Lord Jesus, we pray that you would just,
[8:49] Lord, that you would go and that you
[8:51] would be their comforter during this
[8:52] time, Lord. That you would, Lord, use
[8:54] this as a time to let them know what
[8:57] your peace truly is, Lord. And Lord,
[8:59] invite them to to get to know you
[9:02] through this time, Lord. to know that
[9:03] you're the great comforter, Lord, and
[9:05] just you're the one that will help them
[9:07] through every situation, Lord. Lord, we
[9:10] pray that you would touch Sister Carol's
[9:11] eye, Lord. This the pressure that's
[9:13] there, Lord, that the devil keeps trying
[9:14] to to give her different things, Lord.
[9:17] But Lord, we know that as she wrote on
[9:19] that note, Lord, the devil is a liar,
[9:20] Lord. And we know that you're the healer
[9:22] and you're the one that can handle every
[9:23] situation, Lord. And Lord, we pray that
[9:26] you would just reach down, that you
[9:27] would just touch her, Lord. That you
[9:28] would take away those those lying
[9:30] symptoms, Lord Jesus. And Lord, just may
[9:33] you recognize the faith that's in our
[9:35] sister, Lord. Lord, we pray, Lord, you
[9:37] see her desire, Lord, that you would
[9:39] like to be able to go to the meetings in
[9:41] Virginia, Lord. And Lord, we pray that
[9:44] if it would be your will, that you would
[9:45] just make a way for her, Lord Jesus,
[9:47] that you would provide whatever it is
[9:49] that that she might need, Lord. Whether
[9:50] that be finances, whether that be
[9:53] travel, whether be whatever peace that
[9:55] is, Lord. And Lord, may it just be
[9:58] something, Lord, where she's able to
[10:00] enjoy the services, Lord. She's able to
[10:01] enter into your presence, Lord Jesus,
[10:03] and just get something special from you,
[10:05] Lord. Lord, we don't have to go to to
[10:09] camp meetings to get something from you,
[10:10] Lord. We've gathered again to this
[10:12] evening, Lord. And Lord, though, this
[10:14] may just be a Wednesday evening service,
[10:16] Lord. Maybe we're coming in just kind of
[10:18] knowing, oh, we're going to read in the
[10:20] church ages. We're going to do this.
[10:21] We're going to do that, Lord. Lord, I
[10:23] pray that you would help us to to lay
[10:25] aside maybe the preconceived notions we
[10:27] might have, Lord. And Lord, may we just
[10:29] pull on the gift that you've placed in
[10:31] your servant, Lord. Lord, you know the
[10:34] needs that are on the hearts of the
[10:35] people, Lord. You know the problems or
[10:37] the concerns or Lord, just the the
[10:40] weariness of life that's praying on us
[10:42] right now, Lord. And Lord, I know that
[10:44] you can Brother Wendell's been been
[10:46] studying on on this, Lord. He's been
[10:48] been looking at what he has to minister,
[10:49] Lord. But Lord, I know that you can pull
[10:51] him off his notes, just to to say a few
[10:53] words to someone, Lord, just to
[10:55] encourage a little bit here, to lift up
[10:57] a downtrodden there, Lord, just to
[11:00] provide what the people need, Lord
[11:03] Jesus. Lord, you see the cares and
[11:05] concerns that are on every heart, Lord.
[11:06] And Lord, I pray that you would help
[11:08] each one of us to just lay them aside,
[11:10] Lord, and enter into the worship, Lord.
[11:12] May we just lift your name and praise
[11:14] your name, Lord, because no matter
[11:16] what's happening around us, you're
[11:17] always worthy of our praise, Lord Jesus.
[11:20] Lord, we pray that you would just be in
[11:21] the remaind of the service, Lord. May
[11:23] all that we say and do be pleasing to
[11:24] you. We just commit it into your hands.
[11:26] The name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.

[29:43] deal for me and I know it is for you
[29:44] too. And so we love brother Luke. Amen.
[29:50] So let's look here in Revelations 10
[29:52] 1-7.
[29:54] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[29:57] from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a
[30:01] rainbow was upon his head, and his feet
[30:04] were as it were the sun, or his face as
[30:08] it were the sun, and feet as pillars of
[30:10] fire. He had in his hand a little book
[30:13] open. Now, these next few Wednesday
[30:16] nights when we do the church age book,
[30:18] we're going to look at the little book
[30:21] open. And he set his right foot upon the
[30:24] sea, and his left foot upon the earth.
[30:27] And he cried with a loud voice, as when
[30:29] a lion roarth. And when he cried, seven
[30:32] thunders uttered their voices. And when
[30:34] the thunders had uttered their voices, I
[30:36] was about to write, and I heard a voice
[30:38] from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up
[30:40] those things which the seven thunders
[30:42] uttered, and write them not. And the
[30:45] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[30:48] upon the earth, lifted up his hand to
[30:52] heaven, and swear by him that liveth
[30:55] forever and ever, who created the heaven
[30:57] and the things there and are, the earth,
[31:00] the things therein are, and the sea, the
[31:03] things that are therein, that there
[31:05] should be time no longer, but in the
[31:08] voice, but in the days of the voice of
[31:10] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[31:13] to sound the mystery of God should be
[31:15] finished as he has declared to his
[31:18] servants the prophets. Now, this is
[31:22] we're going to be ministering tonight.
[31:24] Why the seventh messenger? Now, we've
[31:26] been on this and I told you this this
[31:28] this Leoian church age. We're going to
[31:30] take a little more time on this and why
[31:34] last time it was the uh uh Elijah and
[31:39] now this time is why the seventh
[31:42] messenger. And so uh the seventh verse
[31:45] is very important because in the days of
[31:47] this seventh messenger all the mysteries
[31:50] of God would be finished. Let's go to
[31:53] the Lord in prayer.
[31:55] Father we thank you for your love and
[31:58] thank you for your greatness. Just ask
[32:01] Lord that your spirit would would be
[32:03] prevalent among us tonight. That you
[32:06] would help us Lord as as as I in my
[32:11] finite way. I just Lord my my simple way
[32:15] of of of ministering. I just pray that
[32:17] you you'll help me Lord to to just hit
[32:20] some of the areas that you've laid on my
[32:22] heart. And father, as we read the church
[32:24] age book, I just pray that you'll be
[32:27] with our audience here and our audience
[32:29] that is that is on the internet. Father,
[32:32] we love you. We thank you for that
[32:34] blessed Easter. We thank you, Lord, for
[32:37] this great plan of redemption that is
[32:40] that you're winding up. We ask that you
[32:42] help us all tonight in Jesus name. Can
[32:46] the church say amen?
[32:48] And amen. God bless you. You may be
[32:50] seated.
[32:52] We'd like to read here in um in the
[32:57] uh we're going to start on page 326 of
[33:01] the old
[33:02] book. And
[33:04] um we're going to start at the the
[33:07] second
[33:08] paragraph in the new in in the new book.
[33:12] I I failed again to to find what page
[33:15] that is for those of you that are in
[33:17] your new books.
[33:19] Um it is you know at
[33:23] the it's in the messenger
[33:26] section. Um but
[33:29] um but it starts here. It says in order
[33:32] to further clarify our presentation of
[33:37] of this last day
[33:39] prophet, let us particularly note that
[33:42] the prophet of Malachi or Matthew 11 and
[33:45] 12 was John the Baptist. For he was the
[33:48] one foretold in Malachi
[33:51] 3:1. Behold, I send my messenger and he
[33:54] will prepare the way before me. And the
[33:58] Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
[34:01] his temple, even the messenger of the
[34:03] covenant whom ye delight in. He shall
[34:06] come, saith the Lord of hosts. Matthew
[34:11] 11:1-12. And it came to pass when Jesus
[34:13] had made an end of his commanding his 12
[34:16] disciples, he departed thence to teach
[34:18] and preach in their cities. Now when
[34:20] John had heard in the prison the works
[34:23] of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
[34:26] and said unto him, "Art thou he that
[34:28] should come, or do we look for another?"
[34:31] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[34:33] "Go and show
[34:35] um go and show John again those things
[34:39] which you do hear and see." The blind
[34:42] receive their sight. The lame walk. The
[34:44] lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The
[34:47] dead are raised up. The poor have the
[34:49] gospel preached to them. Blessed is he
[34:52] whosoever shall not be offended in me.
[34:55] And as they departed, Jesus began to say
[34:58] unto the multitudes concerning John,
[35:00] "What went ye out into the wilderness to
[35:03] see? A reed shaken with the wind? And
[35:06] what went ye out for to see? A man
[35:09] clothed in soft rainignment?
[35:11] Behold, they that wear soft clothing are
[35:14] in king's houses. But uh what went ye
[35:18] out to see? A prophet? Yay, I say more
[35:22] than a prophet. For this is he of whom
[35:25] it is written, Behold, I send my
[35:27] messenger before thy face, which shall
[35:30] prepare thy way before thee. Verily I
[35:33] say unto you, who among them or among
[35:38] among them that are born of a woman,
[35:40] there is not a greater risen a greater
[35:43] than John the Baptist. Notwithstanding,
[35:46] he that is least in the kingdom of
[35:48] heaven is greater than he. This is this
[35:51] has already taken
[35:53] place. Um it says this this has
[35:56] happened. It is over. But now in Malachi
[36:00] 4:1-6, behold, the day cometh that shall
[36:03] burn as an oven, and all that do all the
[36:06] proud, yay, all that do wickedly shall
[36:09] be stubble. And the day
[36:12] cometh that cometh shall burn them up,
[36:15] saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall
[36:17] leave them neither root nor branch. But
[36:20] unto you that fear my name, shall the
[36:22] son of righteousness arise with healing
[36:24] in his wings, and ye shall go forth and
[36:27] grow up as calves in the stall. Ye shall
[36:30] tread down the wicked, for they shall be
[36:33] ashes under the souls of your feet in
[36:35] the day that I shall do this, sayaeth
[36:37] the Lord of hosts. Now, again, we we we
[36:40] went back over our y'all remember our
[36:42] last Wednesday night's reading. Amen.
[36:45] When this prophet
[36:48] comes, you will walk out on the ashes of
[36:51] the wicked. For they shall be ashes unto
[36:54] the souls of the feet in the day that I
[36:57] shall do this, sayeth the Lord. Remember
[36:59] ye the law of Moses, my servant, whom I
[37:02] commanded unto them him in Horeb, for
[37:04] all Israel, with statutes and judgment.
[37:07] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[37:09] prophet before the coming of the great
[37:12] and dreadful day of the Lord. So, right
[37:15] before these ashes, right before
[37:19] judgment, God sends a prophet. Now, you
[37:22] can't make that say anything than what
[37:24] it's already said. It's it's it's said
[37:26] that now he shall turn the hearts of the
[37:30] fathers to the children, the hearts of
[37:31] the children to their fathers, lest I
[37:33] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[37:35] See, immediately after the coming of
[37:37] this Elijah, the earth will be cleansed
[37:40] by fire, the wicked burn to ashes. Of
[37:43] course, this did not happen at the time
[37:45] of John, the Elijah for his day. The
[37:48] spirit of God that prophesied the coming
[37:51] of the messenger of Malachi 3:1, John
[37:54] was but reiterating his previous
[37:57] prophetic statement of uh Isaiah 4 and3
[38:02] made at least three centuries
[38:03] previously. The voice of him that crith
[38:06] in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[38:08] the Lord. Make straight in the desert a
[38:11] highway for our God. Now John by the
[38:15] Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and
[38:17] Malachi in Matthew 3 and3. For this is
[38:21] he that was spoken of by the prophet
[38:24] Isaiah, saying, "The voice of one crying
[38:26] in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[38:29] the Lord, make his path straight." So,
[38:32] we can well see from these scriptures
[38:34] that the prophet of Malachi
[38:37] uh 3, who was John, was not the prophet
[38:40] of Malachi 4, though indeed both John
[38:43] and this last day prophet have upon them
[38:47] the same spirit which was upon Elijah.
[38:50] Now, this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[38:53] Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[38:56] things. One, according to Malachi 4, he
[39:00] will turn the hearts of the children to
[39:02] the fathers. Two, he will reveal the the
[39:06] seven thunders of Revelations 10, which
[39:09] are the revelations contained in the
[39:11] seven seals. It will be these divinely
[39:14] revealed mystery truths that literally
[39:17] turn the hearts of the children to the
[39:22] Pentecostal fathers.
[39:24] But consider this also. This prophet
[39:27] messenger will be in his nature and
[39:30] manners as were Elijah and
[39:33] John. The people of this prophet uh
[39:36] messenger's day will be as they were in
[39:39] Ahab's day and in John's. Since it is
[39:42] only the children whose hearts will be
[39:44] turned, it is only the children who will
[39:47] listen. Aren't you glad you've got ears
[39:49] to hear? In the days of Ahab, only 7,000
[39:54] true seed Israelites were found. In the
[39:57] days of John, there were also very few.
[40:00] The masses in both ages were in
[40:02] fornication of
[40:04] idolatry. I want to make one more
[40:06] comparison between the Leoysian prophet
[40:09] messenger and John. The prophet
[40:11] messenger who preceded Jesus' first
[40:13] coming, the the the people in John's day
[40:16] mistook him for the Messiah.
[40:19] John 1:19 to20. This is the record of
[40:22] John. When the Jews sent priests and
[40:26] Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who
[40:28] art thou?" He confessed and denied not,
[40:31] but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
[40:34] Now, this last day prophet messenger
[40:36] will have such power before the Lord
[40:39] that there will be those who will
[40:41] mistake him for the Lord Jesus. There
[40:44] will be a spirit in the world at the end
[40:46] time that will seduce some and make them
[40:49] believe this. Matthew
[40:53] 24:24-26 there for there shall rise
[40:55] false Christ false prophets and there
[40:58] shall show signs great signs and wonders
[41:01] and so much that if it were possible
[41:03] they shall deceive the very elect.
[41:05] Behold, I have told you before.
[41:07] Wherefore, if they say unto you, Behold,
[41:10] he is in the desert, go not forth.
[41:12] Behold, he is in the secret chambers.
[41:14] Believe it not. But don't believe it. He
[41:18] is not Jesus Christ. He is not the son
[41:21] of God. He is one of the brethren, a
[41:25] prophet, a messenger, a servant of God.
[41:29] Amen.
[41:30] He needs no greater honor bestowed upon
[41:33] him than that which John received when
[41:37] he was the voice that cried, I am not
[41:39] he, but he is coming after me. Before we
[41:43] close this section on the messenger of
[41:46] Leoian age, we must seriously consider
[41:50] two thoughts. First, this age will have
[41:54] one prophet messenger. Malachi or
[41:57] Revelations 10:7 when he singular shall
[42:01] begin to sound. There has never been an
[42:03] age where God gave his people two major
[42:06] prophets at one time. He gave Enoch
[42:08] alone. He gave Noah alone. He gave Moses
[42:12] alone. Uh he alone had the word though
[42:16] others prophesied. John the Baptist came
[42:18] alone. Now in this last day there is a
[42:21] prophet not a
[42:23] prophetist though in this age there are
[42:26] more women purporting to be God's to
[42:28] give God's revelation the men and the
[42:31] infallible word says he the prophet will
[42:34] reveal the mysteries to the end time
[42:37] people and turn the hearts of the
[42:40] children back to the fathers. There are
[42:43] those who say God's people are going to
[42:45] come together through a collective
[42:47] revelation. I challenge that statement.
[42:50] It is a bald invalid assumption in the
[42:53] face of Revelations 10:7. Now, I do not
[42:57] deny that people will prophesy in the
[42:59] last age and their ministries can and
[43:02] will be correct. I do not deny that
[43:05] there will be prophets even as in the
[43:08] days of of Paul when there was one
[43:11] Agabus, a prophet who prophesied of a
[43:13] famine. I agree that is so. But I deny
[43:17] upon the infallible evidence of the word
[43:20] that there is more than one major
[43:23] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[43:25] mysteries as contained in the word who
[43:28] has the ministry to turn the hearts of
[43:30] the children to the fathers. And I can
[43:33] say amen.
[43:35] Thus saith the Lord by the unfailing
[43:38] word stands and shall stand and be
[43:42] vindicated. There is one prophet
[43:45] messenger to this age. On the basis of
[43:47] human behavior alone, anyone knows that
[43:50] where there are many people, there is
[43:52] even divided opinions on lesser points
[43:55] of of a major doctrine which they all
[43:58] hold uh together. Who then will have the
[44:02] power of infallibility is to be restored
[44:05] in this last age. For this age is going
[44:08] to go back to manifesting the pure word
[44:11] bride. This means we will have the word
[44:15] once again as it was perfectly given and
[44:18] perfectly understood in the days of
[44:20] Paul. I will tell you who will have it.
[44:24] It will be a prophet as thoroughly
[44:27] vindicated or even more thoroughly
[44:29] vindicated than was any prophet in all
[44:33] the ages from Enoch to this day. Because
[44:36] this man will of necessity have the
[44:39] capstone prophetic
[44:41] ministry and God will show him forth and
[44:44] he won't need to speak for himself for
[44:47] he will speak for God by the voice of
[44:49] the sign or God will speak for him by
[44:53] the voice of the sign. Amen.
[44:56] So, we're going to stop right there here
[44:59] this evening and I want to just minister
[45:04] on why this seventh
[45:07] angel and um and because the seventh
[45:11] church age messenger has been clearly
[45:14] stated it must be a prophet. Amen.
[45:19] Malachi 4 says that he will be a
[45:22] restoration prophet. So, he is going to
[45:25] be turning the hearts of the children
[45:28] back to the original faith. It'll bring
[45:32] them right back to the original. Amen.
[45:35] And not just to Pentecost. Amen. But
[45:38] we're going it's taking us all the way
[45:40] back to what Adam and Eve lost in the
[45:44] beginning. Now, this is this is
[45:46] important. And and I want us to remember
[45:50] Jesus said that he or uh um um Jesus
[45:56] can't come back until the restoration or
[46:00] the restitution of all things. Amen. So
[46:05] so Jesus Jesus plainly declared that
[46:08] that he he can't even come back until
[46:12] there is a restitution. Peter said that
[46:15] there in the book of Acts. Amen. They're
[46:18] in Acts 3 and
[46:20] 20. And um um we can turn there just
[46:24] real quickly. Um Acts Acts three and and
[46:28] 20
[46:30] um Peter's preaching there and um and he
[46:35] tells
[46:36] them, let's see here if I can if I can
[46:39] get to it. Amen.
[46:42] It says, "He shall send Jesus Christ,
[46:46] which before was preached unto you, whom
[46:49] the heavens must receive until the time
[46:53] of restitution of all things which God
[46:57] hath spoken by the mouth of his holy
[46:59] prophets since the world began." Now, I
[47:02] want you to I want you to keep this in
[47:04] mind. Heaven must keep Jesus until the
[47:08] restitution of all things. All things
[47:12] that have been spoken out of the mouths
[47:14] of the holy prophets uh uh since the
[47:17] world began. Now mark that down or keep
[47:21] keep that in your mind and mark mark
[47:22] that Revelations 10:7 right beside it
[47:25] because the Revelations 10:7 but in the
[47:28] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[47:32] when he shall begin to sound, preach,
[47:35] prophesy, declare the mystery of God
[47:40] should be finished as he has declared to
[47:43] his servants the prophets. So Jesus
[47:47] cannot come until this restitution,
[47:52] until this restoration, until the
[47:56] seventh church age messenger comes. And
[47:59] when he speaks, then the mystery mystery
[48:03] of what? The mystery of the church. The
[48:06] mystery of redemption. Amen. And and so
[48:09] he is going to finish this whole thing
[48:12] up that has been declared from the book
[48:15] of from the book of Genesis all the way
[48:17] to the book of Revelations. It's going
[48:20] to be finished up and you must see
[48:23] yourself in that scripture. It's not
[48:26] that you see Malachi in the scripture or
[48:29] or or brother Brandham in the scripture.
[48:31] It's good to see brother Brandham in the
[48:33] scripture, but if you're not heeding to
[48:35] the voice that came to you to reveal
[48:38] these things, then we're just idol
[48:41] worshippers. We're just man worshippers
[48:43] and we're not man worshippers. We we are
[48:46] listening very intently because when
[48:50] that voice speaks and if he's got the
[48:52] mystery, if he's got the revelation,
[48:55] then we had better take heed to what
[48:57] that that voice is telling us. Can you
[48:59] say amen? So the scripture says that
[49:02] that heaven will receive until the times
[49:06] of
[49:07] restitution. Amen. Now another one that
[49:10] I want to get at and this is this is why
[49:13] the messenger. Amen. You remember Peter,
[49:16] James and John's and you can go ahead
[49:17] and start turning there in in Luke uh 9
[49:21] and 27. But Peter, James, and John uh
[49:25] you remember them coming down from the
[49:27] mountain and and and and they have seen
[49:29] the preview of the resurrection and the
[49:32] elements of the future kingdom and they
[49:34] were they were so excited. And Jesus
[49:36] says, "Now I want you to don't tell no
[49:38] one because it was not he hadn't died
[49:41] yet. He hadn't he hadn't raised yet."
[49:44] And but yet they had seen it. And so the
[49:46] account, if you were to look there at
[49:48] Matthew uh uh Luke um uh 9 and 27, he
[49:52] says, "But I tell you of a truth, there
[49:55] be some standing here which shall not
[49:59] taste death till they see the kingdom of
[50:03] God." So he's letting them know, amen,
[50:06] there's going to be some of you that
[50:08] that that are going to get a preview of
[50:11] what the rapture and the resurrection is
[50:13] going to look like. And it came to pass
[50:15] about 8 days after these sayings that he
[50:18] took Peter, John, and James, and went up
[50:20] into the mountain to pray. And as he
[50:23] prayed, the fashion of his countenance
[50:25] was altered. His raignment was white and
[50:28] glistening. And and behold, there talked
[50:31] with him two men, which were Moses and
[50:33] Elias, who appeared in glory, and spoke
[50:36] of his deceased, which should be
[50:39] accomplished in Jerusalem. So, so the
[50:43] they they were they were witnessing what
[50:47] this was going to be. And again, brother
[50:48] Brandon would tell us, Amen. There was
[50:50] three things here. Amen. Jesus was not
[50:53] in his humiliation. Jesus was in his
[50:55] glory. It was speaking of the future
[50:58] kingdom. Amen. Moses represented the
[51:01] sleeping saints that were in the ground
[51:03] that would raise. Amen. And then Elijah
[51:06] was the rapturing saints. And y'all
[51:08] remember what the scripture says. When
[51:10] Christ comes in his glory, the dead in
[51:12] Christ shall rise first. Amen. And we
[51:16] which are alive and remain shall be
[51:18] caught up together. So it was speaking.
[51:21] Amen. They were getting a foretaste of
[51:24] what would take place at the end at this
[51:28] end of this leotan church age. Amen.
[51:33] They were getting a witness. This was
[51:35] not going to take place in the first
[51:37] age, second age, third age, fourth age,
[51:39] fifth age, sixth age, or even in the
[51:42] 1906 Pentecostal age. It was going to be
[51:45] at the end of this age. Now, now let's
[51:48] look here. Let's see what Matthew says
[51:50] about that. Matthew 9 or 17 and9. And
[51:54] this is the same account. And this is
[51:56] just given an account of the
[51:57] conversation after they leave this.
[52:01] Amen. And I I'll wait for you to turn if
[52:03] you young people want to turn there
[52:05] because I I think this is this is your
[52:07] scriptures. These are this is for us.
[52:10] And um so if if you we'll just we'll
[52:14] break in here. Now as as they came down
[52:17] from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
[52:19] saying, "Tell the vision to no man until
[52:22] the Son of Man be risen from the dead."
[52:24] And his disciples asked him, saying,
[52:27] "Why then say the scribes that Elias
[52:30] must first come?" Now, they're confused.
[52:33] They have just
[52:35] seen the preview of of the of the
[52:40] resurrection and the rapture and Jesus
[52:43] being
[52:44] glorified. And they were thinking that
[52:46] this was fixing to happen right now. And
[52:48] he was telling them, g then he goes on
[52:51] and says, I uh uh Jesus answered and
[52:55] said to them, Elias shall truly first
[52:59] come and restore all things. So he was
[53:05] he was telling them before this
[53:08] restitution at the end of the leodysian
[53:11] church age when the rapture comes,
[53:14] Christ appears in his glory. Amen. the
[53:17] resurrection uh comes, the rapture takes
[53:20] place. Right before that, he will send
[53:24] an Elijah to take care of that. But then
[53:28] the next scripture says, but this is the
[53:30] one he's referring to. Now, that one
[53:31] he's referring to Malachi 4. But watch,
[53:34] look there in the 12th verse. We'll just
[53:36] keep on reading. But I say unto you,
[53:39] Elias is come already. Malachi 3.
[53:44] Malachi 3. The messenger that was sent
[53:47] before my face to prepare ye the way of
[53:49] the Lord has already come and they knew
[53:53] him not but have done unto him
[53:56] whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall
[53:58] also the son of man suffer of them. So
[54:01] so Jesus was saying okay all right
[54:05] Malachi 4 must come but it's going to
[54:09] happen in the same way that they've done
[54:11] with Malachi 3.
[54:14] They've I the messenger has come. John
[54:17] has come. Prepare ye the way of the
[54:20] Lord. And there was very few that
[54:23] listened. So will it be in this day.
[54:28] Amen. When this rapture is take place,
[54:31] there's going to be a prophet. And you
[54:33] believe me, if there's ever been a
[54:36] prophet, that is important. This prophet
[54:39] is the most important prophets of all
[54:42] prophets because if you don't hear the
[54:44] voice of this prophet, you're going to
[54:47] miss the mystery of the revelation of
[54:51] Christ in you. You say, "I've got it
[54:53] according to Apostle Paul. I've got it
[54:55] according Amen." Do you really do are
[54:58] you walking in the revelation that the
[54:59] Apostle Paul had? I say today things
[55:02] have been so miskeed. We had to have a
[55:05] messenger in this day to turn our hearts
[55:09] back to that faith.
[55:12] Amen. So y'all y'all understand? How
[55:13] about you kids? Are y'all y'all
[55:15] understanding this? Amen. It it's it's
[55:18] so important because when you listen
[55:21] when you listen to the message or you
[55:23] read the message, I I want you to hear.
[55:26] I want you to ask God for revelation.
[55:29] When I pray, when when I'm when I'm
[55:31] listening or when I'm reading, I'm
[55:32] always asking, God, please, please
[55:35] remove the veils from my eyes. Remove,
[55:38] don't let me be blinded to any of these
[55:40] things that you're trying to show me.
[55:42] That's the way I I ask all the time when
[55:44] I'm when I'm praying. Lord, please help
[55:46] me to get this. Amen. So, now now going
[55:51] back to to re keys, if you'd put that
[55:54] back up there, Revelations 10:7. Now,
[55:56] this this is why it's important. Amen.
[55:59] Or yeah, 10:7. But in the days of the
[56:02] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[56:05] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[56:09] would be finished as it is declared to
[56:12] his servants, the prophets. Now, do you
[56:15] see those scriptures all coming
[56:17] together? How how perfectly those
[56:19] scriptures come together. Now, I want us
[56:21] to go back to Revelations 10:1 and and
[56:24] and let's look there again for a
[56:27] moment. When this when this seventh
[56:30] angel comes, there's going to be a great
[56:34] happening. Amen. Now, this is not just
[56:38] going to be a a typical messenger. Um,
[56:44] this is not going to be just a typical
[56:47] message, but the title deed that has
[56:52] that that was stolen, if you want to
[56:56] say, from
[56:57] Adam 6,000 years ago is going to be
[57:03] handed back to God's elect. Now, now
[57:07] this is so important. In the days of the
[57:11] voice there is going of this seventh
[57:13] church age messenger is going to be
[57:15] greater than any other thing because
[57:18] when we look here at the setting I saw
[57:21] another mighty angel come down from
[57:24] heaven
[57:26] clothed with a cloud. Now I I've got a
[57:30] few things here that I want us to uh to
[57:33] look at just for a a few moments. This
[57:36] mighty angel was different from these
[57:39] other angels. Amen. There were angels
[57:42] pouring out vials. They they were
[57:44] messengers to sent to the churches.
[57:47] Amen. Uh uh uh um they were they were
[57:51] they were not not even the angels that
[57:54] they weren't even the angels that that
[57:56] held the seven seals. Amen. This angel
[58:00] was the angel of the covenant. This
[58:04] angel was clothed in a cloud. He had a
[58:07] rainbow on his head. He had It was a He
[58:11] was He Well, let's just look. Let's just
[58:13] look who this who this one was.
[58:15] Revelations 4 and two. Let's see about
[58:19] the cloud and the rainbow. Amen. Four
[58:23] and it's uh yeah, four and two. And this
[58:27] is right at the end again. We're we're
[58:29] back at the end of the the church ages
[58:30] again. Amen. And I I'm not going to keep
[58:33] you long tonight because I really want
[58:34] y'all to catch I want to keep the
[58:36] information pretty pretty short because
[58:38] I I I want you to really catch what I'm
[58:40] saying.
[58:41] Now we're not in the first age, second
[58:45] age, third age, fourth age. We're at the
[58:48] end of the Leonian age. Chapter 3 ends
[58:53] the churches. We will no longer go to
[58:57] church like this. We will no longer the
[58:59] gentile bride will be called to heaven.
[59:03] And the scripture says and immed the
[59:05] fourth the fourth chapter first verse
[59:07] and I looked and behold there was a door
[59:10] opened in heaven and the first voice
[59:12] which I heard was as it were the trumpet
[59:15] speaking with me and which said come up
[59:19] hither I will show thee things which
[59:22] must be hereafter. So now the scene is
[59:25] changing. It's no longer going to church
[59:29] on earth. Now a door is opened in
[59:32] heaven. The rapture has come. Christ has
[59:35] appeared in glory. The resurrected
[59:38] saints have come up. Amen. All of those
[59:41] of us that are alive and remain are
[59:43] caught up and we meet the Lord in the
[59:45] air. The door in heaven is open.
[59:50] Now, John is going to see what he he's
[59:53] going to tell us what he sees in heaven.
[59:56] It says, "Immediately I was in the
[59:57] spirit, and behold, a throne was set in
[1:00:00] heaven, and one sat on the throne, and
[1:00:03] he that was to look upon
[1:00:07] uh and he that that sat was to look upon
[1:00:12] as jasper and sardine stone. And there
[1:00:15] was a rainbow round about the throne in
[1:00:19] the sight like unto emerald. That word
[1:00:22] emerald is yellowish green. Now this is
[1:00:26] this is the same angel of Revelations
[1:00:30] 10. Now when we talk about the angel of
[1:00:32] the covenant, now you say, "Well, why
[1:00:34] would Christ?" Because this coming, if
[1:00:37] you wouldn't mind putting that back up,
[1:00:39] Revelations 10:1. This coming was not
[1:00:43] the physical appearing of Jesus. This
[1:00:47] was the appearing. This was the logos.
[1:00:51] This was the anointing. It was the angel
[1:00:54] of the covenant that was to come. Re
[1:00:58] open the book. Hand the book to the
[1:01:02] seventh angel messenger. And if you miss
[1:01:06] if you miss that anointing that has come
[1:01:09] in this day then we will miss the
[1:01:13] physical return of Jesus Christ. Now
[1:01:16] there will come a time where Christ the
[1:01:19] where Jesus Christ the physical body is
[1:01:23] going to come and get us. This is
[1:01:26] talking about a
[1:01:28] revelation. He's the angel. He's got
[1:01:30] he's clothed with a cloud. the rainbow
[1:01:33] over his head. This is none other than
[1:01:37] the angel of the covenant that appeared
[1:01:40] unto unto Abraham that appeared unto
[1:01:44] Moses. It was the angel of the Lord that
[1:01:47] went with them. It was none other than
[1:01:50] the picture, brother uh sister Clea, if
[1:01:52] you would put the picture of the the
[1:01:54] pillar of fire. Amen. The the pillar of
[1:01:57] fire. That's the angel of the covenant.
[1:02:01] It was the anointing, the logos that has
[1:02:06] come in this day. An angel from heaven
[1:02:10] came in this day and gave the mystery or
[1:02:14] the revelation of the mystery unto that
[1:02:16] seventh angel. Now, seventh church age
[1:02:19] messenger. Now, that's a that's a
[1:02:21] mouthful that I just said. Any
[1:02:22] questions? And throw them at me. I want
[1:02:25] you to throw it out because I I I I if
[1:02:26] I'm missing it, if I mess it, even even
[1:02:28] if if if there's somebody that can say
[1:02:30] it better than me, say it. Amen. Because
[1:02:33] I I want you to get it. I want us all to
[1:02:35] get this. This is this is good, brother
[1:02:42] Merl.
[1:02:45] Okay. Well, I No, I was just thinking
[1:02:48] you might have something that you could
[1:02:49] add to it.
[1:02:54] Yeah. Yeah. It is it it's that that is
[1:02:58] the angel of the covenant. It's the
[1:02:59] reason people see people people talk
[1:03:03] about pe people talk about when let let
[1:03:06] me just okay if you take Revelations
[1:03:11] 10:1 as
[1:03:13] literal then we're going to have a
[1:03:15] problem.
[1:03:17] People think that that is a literal
[1:03:19] where there is going to be a a 900 foot
[1:03:22] Christ or whatever as as as I believe it
[1:03:25] was brother uh or Roberts had a vision
[1:03:27] of a 900 foot Christ that would come and
[1:03:30] and and and stand and and he visited him
[1:03:32] and it was an in a fearful thing and
[1:03:35] they're going to put their hand their
[1:03:36] foot upon land and upon sea but did you
[1:03:40] realize that when we come back when
[1:03:43] Christ comes back there will be no sea
[1:03:49] after the renovation of the earth, the
[1:03:51] sea will be no
[1:03:54] more. So if you're putting that to
[1:03:57] where there's no more time, that means
[1:04:00] that means the millennium's over with,
[1:04:02] everything is finished because the
[1:04:04] millennium is still in time. And if
[1:04:06] you're putting the time in the
[1:04:08] millennium or or millennium in time,
[1:04:09] then we've or if if you're if you're
[1:04:12] saying that that can only happen when
[1:04:14] time is no more, that means that that it
[1:04:18] can only happen after the judgments are
[1:04:20] done, everything is finished, and then
[1:04:22] Christ will put his hand. But but but
[1:04:24] but again, he can't put his foot upon
[1:04:27] land and sea because there will not be a
[1:04:29] literal sea. But let me tell you what
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:32] means. Hallelujah.
[1:04:35] There was a beast who came up out of the
[1:04:37] sea and there was a beast that came up
[1:04:39] out of the land. This is symbolic.
[1:04:43] Amen. The sea. I wonder how many of you
[1:04:45] kids can tell me what the sea is because
[1:04:47] we've said this over and over and over.
[1:04:48] We'll just see how much you know. Y'all
[1:04:51] smiling over
[1:04:53] here.
[1:04:54] Huh? No trick question. You can just
[1:04:57] blurt it out there. Then we'll just tell
[1:04:58] you you're dumb.
[1:05:05] You you boys. What is what what is the
[1:05:07] sea? The beast that come out of the sea.
[1:05:08] What does that
[1:05:10] mean? Oh, man. I'm not doing a good job
[1:05:13] at
[1:05:14] teaching, man. Okay. All right. So,
[1:05:18] there was a beast that came up out of
[1:05:20] the sea and and um
[1:05:25] Revelation
[1:05:26] 17. Let me just read it to you here.
[1:05:29] Revelation 17
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:35] and oh if I if I get to 17 that would be
[1:05:38] a good thing.
[1:05:40] Hallelujah. I thought it was in
[1:05:43] 17. Let's see
[1:05:50] here. Uh I don't I don't see it. I
[1:05:54] thought I had it marked. Uh Revelations
[1:05:56] uh where where is that? Where where The
[1:06:00] waters that thou seen was people's
[1:06:09] multitudes. 17:15. Yes. Okay. And he
[1:06:13] said unto me, the waters which thou
[1:06:15] sawest, where the horse siteth, are
[1:06:17] peoples, and multitudes, nations, and
[1:06:19] tongues, and the t horns which thou
[1:06:22] seeest of the beast. And it and it goes
[1:06:24] on. So there was a beast that came up
[1:06:26] out of the waters. Amen. That was
[1:06:29] peoples, multitudes, nations, and
[1:06:31] tongues. Rome came out of that. Rome
[1:06:35] came out of the multitudes. That's where
[1:06:37] the Catholic Church came out of. But
[1:06:39] then there was a beast, which we again,
[1:06:42] these are all symbols. This is a power,
[1:06:45] not not a not a literal beast, but an
[1:06:47] anointing that came up out of no people.
[1:06:52] Amen. That was the United States. The
[1:06:54] United States is a powerful nation, the
[1:06:57] most powerful nation of in the world.
[1:07:01] And we came out of of no civilization.
[1:07:04] There were people here, but no nations.
[1:07:07] There was there was nothing of
[1:07:09] civilization that was here. So the
[1:07:12] United States, so there was a power that
[1:07:14] came out of nations and kings and there
[1:07:17] was another power that came out of
[1:07:19] nothing. All right? So when Jesus or
[1:07:22] when uh if you might mind putting that
[1:07:24] back up there, Sister Khalil,
[1:07:26] Revelations 10:1, we just keep that up
[1:07:27] there. Uh re Revelation Oh, oops. Uh
[1:07:31] back up to Revelations 10:1. I'm going
[1:07:33] to keep going back and forth to that. Um
[1:07:35] but but so so when we look here at this
[1:07:38] mighty angel, it did not say Jesus came
[1:07:43] down from heaven because he doesn't want
[1:07:46] you getting this mixed up. It's the
[1:07:48] angel, the Christ, the anointed one, the
[1:07:53] logos of God that came down clothed with
[1:07:58] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head.
[1:08:00] What does that rainbow represent? That's
[1:08:02] the covenant. He gave a rainbow. Amen.
[1:08:06] It's the first and the last. He's he is
[1:08:09] he is the one who has given the promise
[1:08:11] and now he's fulfilling the promise. His
[1:08:14] face were as the sun and his feet as
[1:08:17] pillars of fire. And each one of these
[1:08:20] things have a symbol that they
[1:08:23] represent. Now, what I want us to to to
[1:08:26] look at here, Iman, as we as we as we uh
[1:08:31] just deal for a few moments on on this
[1:08:35] on this cloud. Uh Sister Cle, why don't
[1:08:38] you can do you have the cloud that you
[1:08:40] could just put up there here tonight?
[1:08:42] Amen. the cloud there. There there was
[1:08:47] Mount
[1:08:48] Sunset when y'all remember the angel of
[1:08:52] the Lord that came down. That matters of
[1:08:54] fact, if you just if you just keep that
[1:08:56] there, Sister Khalila, let me just read
[1:08:58] a few things uh from that was in the in
[1:09:02] in the um in the newspapers back in
[1:09:06] 1963. This was in the science magazine.
[1:09:08] And it said as a a stratapheric cloud
[1:09:12] over northern
[1:09:14] Arizona abstract and an unusual
[1:09:17] ringshaped cloud was widely observed
[1:09:20] over the northern Arizona
[1:09:22] uh northern Arizona near sunset on 28th
[1:09:26] February
[1:09:28] 1963. From a from a large number of
[1:09:31] observers reports, it is known to have
[1:09:33] appeared overhead near Flagstaff,
[1:09:35] Arizona. From initial computations based
[1:09:39] on four photos taken in Tucson, 190
[1:09:42] miles south of the cloud, its altitude
[1:09:44] is approximately 35 kilometers. The most
[1:09:48] distant observation reported was 280 mi
[1:09:51] from the cloud. The cloud remained
[1:09:54] sunlit for 28 minutes a local sunset.
[1:09:58] The iridescent or rainbow was noticed
[1:10:02] noted by many observers. Tentatively,
[1:10:06] the cloud may be regarded as similar to
[1:10:10] necrius cloud, but its unusually great
[1:10:14] height and unusually uh low altitude
[1:10:19] plus its remarkable shape suggests that
[1:10:22] it was a cloud previously unre of of
[1:10:24] unre recorded type. Near sunset on 28 n
[1:10:29] February
[1:10:31] 1963, the
[1:10:33] uh the
[1:10:35] unusual a cloud of unusual configuration
[1:10:38] coloration was observed in widely
[1:10:41] scattered localities in Arizona and some
[1:10:44] surrounding states. The cloud took the
[1:10:46] form of a large oval ring clear in the
[1:10:49] middle with the long axis running north
[1:10:53] and south. uh figure one cover
[1:10:56] photograph this issue. It remained
[1:10:59] brightly illuminated well after the sun
[1:11:02] had set on high Cyrus clouds to the west
[1:11:07] from Tucson 190 mi to the south and its
[1:11:10] angular elevation appeared to be about
[1:11:13] six degrees. is a rough computation of
[1:11:15] its height based on sunset geometry. One
[1:11:18] made immediately after the cloud entered
[1:11:20] the earth's shadow led me to appeal by
[1:11:24] uh a press and radio for the
[1:11:27] confirmatory reports in order to
[1:11:29] establish the approximate location and
[1:11:33] and to uh secure descriptions from the
[1:11:37] largest possible number of observers.
[1:11:39] From
[1:11:40] approximately 150 reports, many
[1:11:42] communicated by persons well aware that
[1:11:45] they had seen a uh a type of
[1:11:48] unprecedented uh had had not seen a type
[1:11:54] of years of sky watching. It was quickly
[1:11:57] established that the cloud layover head
[1:11:59] in the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona,
[1:12:01] that it exhibited iridescent of the sort
[1:12:05] associate associated with the
[1:12:07] stratapheric neurosis clouds in the
[1:12:10] Arctic uh and that its internal
[1:12:13] structure was very peculiar. So that's
[1:12:16] one. I I messed that reading up, but uh
[1:12:18] that's this is here is another. And now,
[1:12:21] now when you looked at it, won't you
[1:12:23] show us the the original version of
[1:12:25] that, Sister Khal? Now, all right. So, I
[1:12:28] I think this is interesting and I want
[1:12:30] you to understand he shall come
[1:12:33] clothed in a
[1:12:35] cloud.
[1:12:37] Now, people want to blow this off one
[1:12:40] way or the other, saying that it can't
[1:12:42] happen, that it it's got to be this,
[1:12:44] it's got to be that. But I'm going to
[1:12:46] read you the newspaper
[1:12:48] reports. But then I'm also going to tell
[1:12:50] you show read to you the vision that
[1:12:52] brother Brandham had before we before we
[1:12:55] go into this and then understand what
[1:12:58] that this was
[1:13:00] supernatural. All right. So this here is
[1:13:03] the Arizona Republic. Shortly before
[1:13:06] sunset in February 28, 1963, a
[1:13:08] strikingly beautiful mysterious cloud
[1:13:10] swept across or swept northward across
[1:13:12] Arizona. Some who saw the cloud
[1:13:14] estimated to be 30 mi across and 26
[1:13:17] miles high observed that it remained
[1:13:20] bright 28 minutes after the sun set.
[1:13:24] Others saw myriad colors in its
[1:13:27] vapor-like structure. Within it just
[1:13:30] makes me just want to rejoice. You know
[1:13:32] what? Within days within days, more than
[1:13:35] 200 reports poured into the University
[1:13:38] of Arizona's Institute. Now, this is
[1:13:40] this is not now this this is a this over
[1:13:43] in Arizona. They have clouds all the
[1:13:45] time because they always have rockets.
[1:13:46] They've got they they they've got
[1:13:48] government planes. They've got all of
[1:13:50] these things that's going off around
[1:13:52] there all the time. But what took place
[1:13:54] here was
[1:13:57] crazy. As you all can see, 200 this this
[1:14:01] one here has 200 reports of this cloud.
[1:14:05] All right. It says um uh within days
[1:14:08] more than 200 reports poured into the
[1:14:10] University of Arizona's Institute of ASM
[1:14:12] atmospheric physics in answer to a
[1:14:15] request by James McDonald. The celestial
[1:14:18] phenomenon left waves of public p
[1:14:22] public I can't I can't read or talk
[1:14:25] tonight. publicity in its wake. Both the
[1:14:29] Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette
[1:14:32] uh printed stories. Science magazine
[1:14:35] included in April 19, 1963. Life carried
[1:14:38] it in its June 11 edition the same year.
[1:14:41] None of the publications had the answer
[1:14:43] to what it was, not even Dr. McDonald.
[1:14:46] Tentatively, the Tucson atmospheric
[1:14:49] science senior physics said, "It may be
[1:14:52] regarded similar to a
[1:14:55] nacrius uh iridescent cloud, but is
[1:14:59] unusually great height." said, "But is
[1:15:03] unusually great height and unusually low
[1:15:06] altitude. Plus, it resarkable shape
[1:15:09] suggests that it was a cloud of previous
[1:15:11] unrecorded type. Many persons said it is
[1:15:15] exhibited exhibited the iridescence of
[1:15:18] the sort associated with a stratapheric
[1:15:20] nrious uh cloud in the Arctic. It was
[1:15:24] above the limits of contrail
[1:15:26] formations." Dr. McDonald's wrote in his
[1:15:29] in an article in 1963 issue of
[1:15:31] Weatherwise, even those possible
[1:15:34] possibly made in flight by the uh of the
[1:15:38] X5. Besides a check revealed, there were
[1:15:41] no X-15 flights that day. The cloud then
[1:15:44] has continued to baffle everyone in
[1:15:47] Arizona except 600 churches in the
[1:15:50] Phoenix, Mesa, and Tucson.
[1:15:53] To them, it was a physical manifestation
[1:15:55] of seven angels appearing near Sunset
[1:15:59] Mountain, 40 miles northwest of Tucson
[1:16:02] to William Brennham, an Indiana born
[1:16:04] Christian evangelist. Now, and then we
[1:16:07] can just go on and read a few we could
[1:16:09] we could read Time magazine themselves,
[1:16:12] what with what Time magazine has put in
[1:16:14] there. But what I'm wanting to get to
[1:16:16] you is this Christ the the the
[1:16:20] scripture. Sister Kala, if you wouldn't
[1:16:22] mind putting Revelations 10:1 back up,
[1:16:25] and we'll go back and forth between
[1:16:26] these clouds. Uh, how many love sister
[1:16:29] Kala? Amen. And um, so I saw another
[1:16:34] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:16:38] clothed with a cloud. Now, I want us to
[1:16:41] just let's let's just see what what's
[1:16:43] important about this. And a rainbow was
[1:16:45] upon his head. Now, they said this thing
[1:16:47] that the the rainbow, it was going back
[1:16:49] and forth with all of these different
[1:16:51] colors that was taking place uh while it
[1:16:54] was there. It was upon his head and his
[1:16:57] feet as it were the sun and and his feet
[1:17:01] his face as were the sun feet as pillars
[1:17:03] of fire. And let's just go one down.
[1:17:05] We'll just keep on going. And he has and
[1:17:06] he had in his hand a little book open
[1:17:12] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:17:15] and his left foot upon the earth. Now
[1:17:20] face shining like the sun, feet as
[1:17:23] brass. You could go back to the first of
[1:17:26] the of the church ages when we first
[1:17:28] started. We told you about the the
[1:17:30] brass, what that represented. We took an
[1:17:32] entire we took an entire service on
[1:17:35] that. We took an entire service on those
[1:17:37] others. So, we're not going to go
[1:17:38] through that. But we showed you in
[1:17:40] symbols what that represented. Now, this
[1:17:43] little book, remember five, John was
[1:17:48] weeping. John wept in Revelations 5
[1:17:52] because the book was closed. And the
[1:17:55] call went out, who is worthy to open
[1:18:00] this book that is in the hand of the
[1:18:03] Almighty God? And the reply says, "No
[1:18:07] one was worthy." No one was found worthy
[1:18:10] in heaven. No one was found worthy on
[1:18:12] earth. No one was found worthy under the
[1:18:14] earth among the dead. And John
[1:18:19] wept. He wept because it was the book,
[1:18:23] the title deed to the earth, the book of
[1:18:25] redemption. And no one was able to open
[1:18:29] the book. And then the cry came out.
[1:18:33] Amen. Weep not, John, for the lion of
[1:18:36] the tribe of Judah hath prevailed. And
[1:18:38] when John turned around, he saw a lamb
[1:18:42] come and take the book and loose the
[1:18:46] seven seals from off the book.
[1:18:50] So now, Revelations 10 is saying, now he
[1:18:54] has the
[1:18:57] book and it's open. Wow.
[1:19:01] The lamb opened the book. Now he's
[1:19:04] giving the revelation. Revelations 10:7.
[1:19:08] But in the days of the voice, if you go
[1:19:11] on down to that seventh verse, in the
[1:19:13] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:19:16] the mystery should be complete.
[1:19:21] Do you see the importance of brother
[1:19:22] Brandham? the importance because he's
[1:19:25] wanting you and me to catch this
[1:19:30] revelation. Not the brother Brandham
[1:19:32] wants us to catch the revelation. God
[1:19:34] wants us to catch the
[1:19:36] revelation. Amen. Can you say amen
[1:19:40] now? Okay. Where's the vision?
[1:19:44] Amen. Well, glory to God. Do you love
[1:19:48] him?
[1:19:50] I didn't bring the vision. I got to get
[1:19:51] it off my computer. Just hang on. Set
[1:19:53] tight. Amen. I shall
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:59] return. Hallelujah. We'll read this
[1:20:02] vision and then and then let you see. Uh
[1:20:06] hopefully I I've got this all coming
[1:20:08] together now for
[1:20:12] you. Praise the Lord. Oh, do you love
[1:20:15] him so much?
[1:20:19] Amen. Okay.
[1:20:28] Amen. Well, where is where is that?
[1:20:36] Uh I I I got it
[1:20:39] there. See where I where I put that
[1:20:45] thing. Give me a few more minutes.
[1:20:54] Well, if I didn't say
[1:21:03] that. Praise the
[1:21:10] Lord. I put it to some of my notes. What
[1:21:13] I do is I I get to studying and I have I
[1:21:15] have all these I have different deals
[1:21:17] all opened up.
[1:21:19] And uh
[1:21:22] uh I study on different sermons at the
[1:21:25] same time lots of
[1:21:27] times. Praise the
[1:21:31] Lord. All right. So I just pull it
[1:21:34] straight out of the message. All right.
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:39] So it it says um
[1:21:44] now he he says u all of you have seen it
[1:21:48] around the world. You don't go to sleep
[1:21:51] standing here on the platform talking to
[1:21:53] you people. You hear me go into vision.
[1:21:55] Sister Keys if you wouldn't mind putting
[1:21:57] that cloud back up there.
[1:21:59] Um you you
[1:22:03] uh people standing here on the platform
[1:22:06] talking to people. You hear me go into
[1:22:07] visions and come back when I'm riding in
[1:22:10] a car with you elsewhere. I tell you
[1:22:12] things that's going to happen. Never
[1:22:14] fails. It never has. Has anyone ever
[1:22:17] seen it fail? Congregation says, "No,
[1:22:19] no, sir. It can't fail. It won't fail as
[1:22:24] long as it's God." Notice right on the
[1:22:27] platform, thousands before tens of
[1:22:30] thousands of people even in other
[1:22:31] languages that I can't even speak till
[1:22:34] it don't fail. See, it's God. Now, this
[1:22:37] is in the sermon 1962, just before the
[1:22:40] cloud appeared,
[1:22:42] 1962. And this is in this in the in in
[1:22:45] this in the sermon title. Is this the
[1:22:47] sign of the end time? Now, he's just
[1:22:49] he's he's he's coming up and telling me
[1:22:51] he just seen this this vision a week
[1:22:53] ago. He says, now now in this vision, or
[1:22:57] as I was speaking, I looked and I saw a
[1:23:00] strange thing. It seemed like my little
[1:23:02] son Joseph was by my side. I was talking
[1:23:05] to him. Now, if you'll notice, if you'll
[1:23:07] watch the vision real close, you'll see
[1:23:08] why Joseph was standing there. I looked
[1:23:11] and there was a little bush and on this
[1:23:14] on this little bush in a constellation
[1:23:16] of birds, little bitty birds about a
[1:23:18] half inch long and a half inch high. And
[1:23:21] they were little veterans. They their
[1:23:23] feathers was beat down. There was about
[1:23:26] two or three on on the top limb, six or
[1:23:29] eight on the next limb, 15 to 20 on the
[1:23:33] next limb, coming on down like a shape
[1:23:36] of a pyramid. And those little fellows,
[1:23:38] little messengers, they were pretty well
[1:23:40] worn out. And they were watching
[1:23:45] eastward in this vision for for it made
[1:23:48] it so it it made it so purpose that he
[1:23:51] didn't want me to fail to see where it
[1:23:54] was at. So, Brother Brandham is telling
[1:23:56] them, "When this vision takes place, I'm
[1:23:59] going to be around that Tucson area."
[1:24:01] All right. Now, um uh
[1:24:05] uh he said, "I I was at Tucson, Arizona
[1:24:09] in the vision, for it made it so purpose
[1:24:11] that he didn't want me to fail to see
[1:24:14] where it was at. I was picking a
[1:24:16] sandbird off of me from the desert."
[1:24:18] This is in the vision. And I said, "Now,
[1:24:21] I know I I know this is a vision. I know
[1:24:24] that I'm in at Tucson. I know them
[1:24:27] little birds. They're represent
[1:24:29] something. And and they were watching
[1:24:31] eastward. And all of a sudden, they
[1:24:33] taken the notion to fly. And away they
[1:24:35] went eastward. And as soon as they left,
[1:24:37] a constellation of larger birds came.
[1:24:40] They looked like doves, sharp pointed
[1:24:43] wings, kind of gray color, light little
[1:24:46] lighter color than than these first
[1:24:48] little messengers were. and they were
[1:24:51] coming eastward swiftly. No sooner than
[1:24:55] they got out of my sight, I turned again
[1:24:57] to look westward and there it happened.
[1:25:00] There was a blast that actually shook
[1:25:03] the whole earth. Now, don't miss this
[1:25:05] and you on tape. Be sure you get this
[1:25:07] right. First, a blast. And I thought it
[1:25:10] sounded like a sound barrier or whatever
[1:25:13] you call it when the planes cross the
[1:25:14] sound and the sound comes back to the
[1:25:16] earth. just shook like roared
[1:25:19] everything. And then it could uh it
[1:25:22] could have been a like a great clap of
[1:25:24] thunder, lightning like I didn't see the
[1:25:26] lightning. I just heard that great blast
[1:25:30] that went forth. It sounded like it was
[1:25:32] south from me towards Mexico. And it but
[1:25:35] it shook the earth. And when it did, I
[1:25:38] was still looking westward. And way off
[1:25:39] into eternity, I saw a constellation of
[1:25:43] something coming. And it looked like it
[1:25:45] it might have come like little
[1:25:48] dots. There could have been no less than
[1:25:50] five and no more than seven, but they
[1:25:54] were in the shape of a pyramid. And and
[1:25:56] like these messengers coming. And when
[1:25:58] it did, the power of almighty God lifted
[1:26:01] me up to meet them. And when I see it,
[1:26:04] it's never left me. He says, "Well, I
[1:26:07] can see it. It's never left me. Eight
[1:26:09] days has gone and I can't forget it yet.
[1:26:13] I never had anything to bother me like
[1:26:15] that has. My family will tell you. I
[1:26:17] could see those angels, those shapedback
[1:26:19] wings traveling faster than sound could
[1:26:22] traveler from. They come from eternity
[1:26:24] in a split like a twinkling of an eye.
[1:26:27] Not even the bat of an eye, just a
[1:26:29] twinkle. And they they were there. And I
[1:26:32] didn't have time to count. I didn't have
[1:26:34] time no more than just look. mighty
[1:26:36] ones, great powerful angels, snow white
[1:26:41] wings set and heads. They they were and
[1:26:45] when it did, I I was caught up in the in
[1:26:48] the in the pyramid of constellations.
[1:26:50] And I thought, now this is it. I was
[1:26:51] numb all over. And as I and I said, oh
[1:26:54] my, this means that there will be a
[1:26:57] blast that will kill me at I'm at the
[1:27:00] end of my road now. I must have uh uh I
[1:27:03] mustn't tell people my people when this
[1:27:06] vision leaves. I don't want them to know
[1:27:07] about it. But the heavenly father has
[1:27:09] let me know that my time is finished. I
[1:27:11] won't tell my family so they won't worry
[1:27:13] about me because he's fix he's fixing to
[1:27:15] go and these angels has come for me and
[1:27:18] and it'll you know I'll be killed pretty
[1:27:23] soon uh in now in some kind of
[1:27:26] explosion. Then it came to me while I
[1:27:28] was in the constellation constellation.
[1:27:30] No, this isn't it. If it was have killed
[1:27:34] you, it would have killed Joseph. And I
[1:27:36] could hear Joseph calling for me. Well,
[1:27:39] then I turned again and I thought, Lord
[1:27:41] God, what does this vision mean? And I
[1:27:43] wondered and then it came to me. Not a
[1:27:46] voice just came to me. Oh, that is the
[1:27:49] angels of the Lord coming to give me a
[1:27:52] new com my new commission. And when I
[1:27:55] thought that, I raised my hands and I
[1:27:57] said,"Lord Jesus, what will you have me
[1:28:00] to do?" And the vision left me for
[1:28:03] almost an hour, I couldn't feel. Now you
[1:28:07] people know what the blessings of the
[1:28:09] Lord is. But the power of the Lord is
[1:28:11] altogether different. The power of the
[1:28:14] Lord in them kind of places. I I felt it
[1:28:18] many many times before in vision, but
[1:28:20] never like that. It feels like a
[1:28:23] reverent fear. I was so scared till I
[1:28:26] was paralyzed in the presence of these
[1:28:28] beings. I tell you the truth, as Paul
[1:28:31] said, I lie not. If you never caught me
[1:28:34] saying anything wrong before like that,
[1:28:37] something is fixing to happen. Then
[1:28:39] after a while, I said, Lord Jesus, if
[1:28:41] I'm going to be killed, let me know so I
[1:28:44] won't tell my people about this. But if
[1:28:46] something else, but if it's something
[1:28:47] else, let me know. But nothing answered.
[1:28:50] And after the spirit left me for about
[1:28:52] an a half hour, I guess, or more, I
[1:28:54] said, 'Lord, if it is,
[1:28:57] then if if it is then that I'm I'm going
[1:28:59] to be killed and you're finished with me
[1:29:01] and I'm going to be taken home now,
[1:29:04] which which if that's it, I'm fine.
[1:29:06] That's all right. I said, if it's if it
[1:29:09] is, let me know. Send your power back
[1:29:11] upon me again. Then I'll know not to
[1:29:13] tell my people or anybody about it
[1:29:16] because you're fixing to catch me away.
[1:29:18] Nothing happened. I waited for a while.
[1:29:21] Then I said, "Lord Jesus, if it did not
[1:29:24] mean that and if it means you've got
[1:29:26] something for me to do and it'll be
[1:29:29] revealed to me later, then send your
[1:29:31] power." And it almost took me from the
[1:29:34] room. I found myself somewhere over in a
[1:29:37] corner. I could hear my wife trying to
[1:29:40] shake a door. The door in the bedroom
[1:29:41] was locked. And I had a Bible open was I
[1:29:44] don't know but it but it was in I
[1:29:46] believe Romans nine the last verse.
[1:29:49] Behold I lay in Zion a cornerstone a
[1:29:52] stumbling stone as precious cornerstone.
[1:29:54] Whosoever believeth in him shall not be
[1:29:56] ashamed. And I thought it's strange I'd
[1:29:59] be reading that. The spirit still
[1:30:01] packing me in the room. I closed the
[1:30:03] Bible and stood there. I went over I
[1:30:06] looked through the window. Uh, I went
[1:30:09] over to the window and it was about
[1:30:10] 10:00 in the day or better and I raised
[1:30:13] my hands. I said, "Lord God, I don't
[1:30:14] understand. This is a strange day to me.
[1:30:17] I'm beside myself almost." And I said,
[1:30:20] "Lord, what does that mean? Let me read
[1:30:23] it again if if it be you." And now it
[1:30:25] sounds juvenile, but I took the Bible
[1:30:27] and opened it up and there it was again
[1:30:29] in the same place. Paul's telling the
[1:30:32] Jews, they had tried uh to to to the
[1:30:35] Romans that the Jews tried to accept it
[1:30:38] by works, but it was by faith that we
[1:30:40] believe
[1:30:41] it. Well, it's a tr it's a terrific time
[1:30:44] since now. You can see where I stand.
[1:30:47] Now, I don't know what's happening. I
[1:30:50] don't know what to say. I would
[1:30:54] encourage everyone to go back and read
[1:30:56] this because brother Brandham is giving
[1:30:57] the giving the
[1:31:00] vision but he's saying I don't know what
[1:31:02] it means and so he asked the question
[1:31:05] all through the sermon what what I I'm
[1:31:08] presuming here what does I'm just
[1:31:11] telling you I'm letting you know what
[1:31:15] happened at the end of the sermon he's
[1:31:18] quaking he's he's well he's quaking all
[1:31:20] through the sermon you can hear him
[1:31:21] shaking as he's
[1:31:23] and he's saying, "I'm going I'm going to
[1:31:26] go to
[1:31:28] Tucson." That's where the vision said he
[1:31:31] would meet me. I I'm going to
[1:31:34] wait. I don't know what's going to
[1:31:37] happen.
[1:31:40] Now, we find that three months
[1:31:43] later and and and we'll be getting into
[1:31:46] that later on, but three months later,
[1:31:49] Brother Brandham was hunting with some
[1:31:52] brothers. They're just uh uh uh right
[1:31:56] right outside of Tucson there. And they
[1:31:59] were hunting for hogs. And as they were
[1:32:02] hunting for hogs, um Brother Brandham
[1:32:05] had had got his and so he was helping
[1:32:07] them. and and and he had seen some hogs
[1:32:10] the other day and the day before. So he
[1:32:12] had told him, "You go around this way. I
[1:32:13] I'm going to go down where I had seen
[1:32:15] them and I'm going to spook them off to
[1:32:17] you." And uh um and so he had he had
[1:32:21] just seen some hogs and and u uh he he
[1:32:26] he had just taken a tortilla or
[1:32:29] something and and and and put it put it
[1:32:31] on on
[1:32:33] a on a little limb there so they could
[1:32:35] see where he was at. uh that they'd know
[1:32:37] he had been there and he man he was just
[1:32:39] taken off and just before now remember
[1:32:42] the vision he was taking a a bull header
[1:32:45] or a stick tied off. Y'all remember
[1:32:46] that? And he says and just before then
[1:32:48] he had looked down there and he seen it.
[1:32:50] So he reached down to to get a
[1:32:51] bullheader off and and he was fixing to
[1:32:54] take off and then he had already forgot
[1:32:56] about the vision and as he threw that
[1:32:58] thing on the ground there was this great
[1:33:01] big explosion. He said it was so loud it
[1:33:04] just shook. At first he thought he got
[1:33:06] shot. He thought that one of the
[1:33:08] brothers had shot him on accident. And
[1:33:11] and then is when the angels appeared.
[1:33:15] Seven angels came down and he was caught
[1:33:17] up in the constellation of that cloud
[1:33:19] right there. Caught up in that
[1:33:23] constellation. That seven those seven
[1:33:25] that picture that was taken of those
[1:33:28] seven angels. that picture of those of
[1:33:31] of that cloud was those seven angels
[1:33:34] that had appeared to him. He says if
[1:33:37] you'll notice uh there is your there on
[1:33:39] your right and up there to the top he
[1:33:41] says that if he would have been in the
[1:33:43] constellation like this see how how
[1:33:46] would how would he have been? It would
[1:33:47] been he says up to on the he on the
[1:33:49] right side he said that great one with
[1:33:52] the with the wings swept back. So I
[1:33:53] guess he would be in the face of it like
[1:33:55] this. But those wings that are swept
[1:33:58] back uh over the top where brother
[1:34:02] talked about the wigwin, he said that
[1:34:04] was that seventh angel. He said it was
[1:34:06] the mighty angel when he was caught up
[1:34:08] in that constellation. It was just great
[1:34:10] and mighty and and he and he looked just
[1:34:15] stood out to him more than the others.
[1:34:18] Now this was what he
[1:34:23] foretold. Then the revelation comes to
[1:34:26] him and of course he was given the
[1:34:28] commission go back to Jeffersonville for
[1:34:31] the opening of the seven
[1:34:33] seals. We understand that the seven
[1:34:36] seals the revelations were contained in
[1:34:39] the mysteries the unveiling of the
[1:34:42] mysteries of the seven thunders. Amen.
[1:34:47] This seventh church age messenger is
[1:34:50] greater than
[1:34:52] than any other
[1:34:55] messenger that the church has ever
[1:34:57] received. This is the
[1:35:00] ending. This is the ending of all
[1:35:02] things. And the revelation has been
[1:35:05] gloriously given to us. Aren't you glad
[1:35:08] that God
[1:35:11] supernaturally amen vindicated for you
[1:35:14] and for me? I'm going to open it up for
[1:35:16] questions,
[1:35:17] comments. We're going to stop right
[1:35:19] there. I think it's a good place to stop
[1:35:21] tonight. Amen. So, uh, and I went a
[1:35:24] little bit longer than what I
[1:35:26] intended. When you get a lot of
[1:35:28] information, it gets it gets harder to
[1:35:29] keep it all together. But, but did I
[1:35:32] piece the pieces together for y'all
[1:35:36] tonight? Oh, boy. We're going to have to
[1:35:39] strike this from the record and go try
[1:35:40] it again. Y'all ready for another hour?
[1:35:42] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:47] Now I
[1:35:51] say and I I I know that and and and
[1:35:54] maybe maybe my understanding of it you
[1:35:57] maybe you don't agree with my my
[1:36:00] understanding of it but this is the way
[1:36:01] that I I see it the way brother Brandham
[1:36:05] talked about it. Brother Brandham talked
[1:36:06] about that cloud the Lord but sister
[1:36:08] sister Clea put it back the original the
[1:36:11] original one. Okay, that was that was
[1:36:14] the cloud. And then when brother
[1:36:15] Brandham was wasn't it the unveiling of
[1:36:18] God, wasn't it at that sermon that that
[1:36:21] the Lord told Brother Brandham, "Turn it
[1:36:23] to the right. Then go ahead and turn it
[1:36:25] to the other way." Amen. Turn it to the
[1:36:27] right and you will see Christ the
[1:36:30] wigwin. That's that's this that's why we
[1:36:33] have that cloud right here. Amen. And he
[1:36:36] says, "Now you can see you can see the
[1:36:38] face of Christ.
[1:36:40] Christ in there wigged by the angels,
[1:36:44] the the almighty one. Amen. Come clothed
[1:36:50] in a
[1:36:51] cloud. I I believe that that is
[1:36:56] true. I believe that if you're looking
[1:36:58] for a physical Jesus with a physical
[1:37:03] cloud, you're going to miss the rapture.
[1:37:10] Because this is the revelation. You've
[1:37:13] got to accept this
[1:37:15] revelation. Jesus does not show up here
[1:37:18] on earth until he comes back in the
[1:37:22] millennium. So Jesus is not going to
[1:37:25] show
[1:37:27] up on on the six o'clock evening lu and
[1:37:31] it's not going to be it's not that's not
[1:37:32] the way. It's the secret coming of the
[1:37:37] Lord
[1:37:39] Jesus. There is a physical Jesus Christ.
[1:37:43] That's true. But he's promised he would
[1:37:46] come in this last day in his in his
[1:37:51] theophony form. He was going to come a
[1:37:55] in as the angel of the
[1:37:58] covenant. Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad
[1:38:01] that you've heard that voice?
[1:38:05] Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. Well,
[1:38:08] the musicians can
[1:38:09] come. Amen. And um um so this I I told
[1:38:15] you that when we got to this this uh
[1:38:19] layout of an age, we were going to not
[1:38:21] just read, but we just going to put sort
[1:38:22] of put the skids on it a little bit
[1:38:24] there and and really understand,
[1:38:26] especially in this messenger, and and
[1:38:29] show you
[1:38:31] This is big, folks. This is
[1:38:36] major. Brother Brandham's family, his
[1:38:40] mom and dad were not even Christians at
[1:38:43] all. Not even Christians at
[1:38:45] all. And and his mother was was a
[1:38:49] 15year-old girl
[1:38:52] uh given birth to to
[1:38:55] to her boy.
[1:38:58] And u the old the old shack cabin they
[1:39:03] were lived in it
[1:39:06] had holes in in it. It didn't even have
[1:39:09] regular windows. You can you you've
[1:39:11] probably seen the old cabin that brother
[1:39:13] Brandon was born
[1:39:14] in. And he was born before sunlight
[1:39:18] before the sun even come out. And the
[1:39:23] baby was born. Sister Ella Brandom was
[1:39:26] was smothering and they opened the door
[1:39:29] to get some fresh air
[1:39:32] in and when they opened the door that
[1:39:35] little pillar of
[1:39:37] fire came came in that came in that open
[1:39:40] you know that the old the old windows it
[1:39:43] was a window that they opened up was
[1:39:44] like a door and when they opened it up
[1:39:47] pillar of fire came and rested over the
[1:39:51] baby now they weren't they weren't even
[1:39:53] Christians could Could you imagine?
[1:39:55] Could you
[1:39:57] imagine? We don't
[1:40:03] deify the prophet at
[1:40:11] all. And those who do don't know, well,
[1:40:14] they wouldn't. They just don't know.
[1:40:18] You say, "Well, well, everything is
[1:40:20] brother random this, brother random
[1:40:21] that, brother random this, brother
[1:40:23] random that."
[1:40:29] Yeah, it's
[1:40:36] true because it was
[1:40:39] Jesus, the
[1:40:41] Christ, the angel of the covenant, to
[1:40:44] come and put his
[1:40:46] approval on that prophet.
[1:40:50] I would just imagine in the days of the
[1:40:53] Apostle Paul of the early
[1:40:55] church, I would just imagine Paul said
[1:40:59] this, Paul said, "We should do it this
[1:41:01] way." Paul, why? Because
[1:41:05] Paul, he was the prophet to that first
[1:41:08] church. He was the apostle. He said, "I
[1:41:11] magnify my office. I am the apostle to
[1:41:15] the
[1:41:16] Gentiles.
[1:41:18] Those were his exact words. I magnify my
[1:41:22] office. He just flat out telling
[1:41:27] you. And those that are in Corinthians
[1:41:29] were sort of giving him a hard time.
[1:41:32] Yeah. Your authority. He says, "Did the
[1:41:34] word come from you or did the word come
[1:41:36] to you?"
[1:41:39] He says, "If any of you think to be
[1:41:40] prophets or spiritual, let every one of
[1:41:43] you
[1:41:45] acknowledge what I have said as from the
[1:41:55] Lord." The vindication was upon
[1:41:59] him. No one could no one could dispute
[1:42:04] that. And there's no sign
[1:42:07] There's no
[1:42:09] sign of the pillar of fire ever
[1:42:11] appearing to him again, which I'm sure
[1:42:13] it
[1:42:14] did. But all they had was the pillar of
[1:42:18] fire that appeared to him the first
[1:42:19] time. Said, "Saul, Saul, it's hard for
[1:42:22] you to kick against the priest. I've
[1:42:24] called you to be a light to the
[1:42:27] Gentiles." But the presence of the Lord
[1:42:30] was with
[1:42:32] him. Here we
[1:42:35] are in this last age where the age where
[1:42:38] there's everyone's a prophet and
[1:42:40] everyone's got sayeth the Lord and
[1:42:43] everyone got their
[1:42:49] opinions. But God in this
[1:42:52] age has sent us a
[1:42:57] prophet. Lots of prophets. Lots of
[1:43:00] prophets.
[1:43:03] But only one had the pillar of fire like
[1:43:07] Elijah. And that pillar of fire was seen
[1:43:09] over and over and over and
[1:43:17] over. So the preachers out there in the
[1:43:19] other places, they they they learn, they
[1:43:21] have to learn from somebody somewhere.
[1:43:23] They're they're they're they're going to
[1:43:26] seminars, seminaries. They've got
[1:43:28] they've got studies and their their
[1:43:31] their studies are lined up with all
[1:43:33] these
[1:43:34] opinions and I have no problem I have no
[1:43:38] problem with books. I
[1:43:45] don't and I have to go to a book
[1:43:48] occasionally to learn a word or see what
[1:43:50] it means or this that and the other.
[1:43:57] What God wanted us to know in this
[1:44:01] day, he put it very
[1:44:04] clearly in every one of these. Christ
[1:44:07] must stay in heaven until the
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:13] restitution. This rapture and
[1:44:15] resurrection cannot take place until the
[1:44:20] restitution. The mighty angel is going
[1:44:23] to come with an open
[1:44:25] book. And in the days of the voice of
[1:44:27] that seventh church age messenger, the
[1:44:30] mystery will be
[1:44:32] complete. You know what that does for
[1:44:38] me? Doesn't make me a stuffed shirt. It
[1:44:41] makes me feel humble that God would do
[1:44:44] this in this
[1:44:46] generation. And I want to love the Lord
[1:44:48] that much the more because
[1:44:50] of Amen.
[1:44:57] There's
[1:44:58] never been a
[1:45:02] day like this
[1:45:05] day to
[1:45:08] me. There's
[1:45:10] never been a
[1:45:14] day like this day. I
[1:45:20] see. There's
[1:45:24] never been a
[1:45:27] light to
[1:45:29] shine so
[1:45:33] bright
[1:45:37] as Oh
[1:45:39] yes. Oh, can we sing it from our hearts
[1:45:43] now? Oh, there's
[1:45:47] never been a day
[1:45:52] like
[1:45:54] this. To
[1:45:57] me, there's
[1:46:00] never been a
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:09] day. There's
[1:46:14] never been a light that shines.
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:31] I think on a service like
[1:46:35] this at the end of this service, I think
[1:46:37] it
[1:46:39] would be deserving of all of us
[1:46:42] examining our
[1:46:44] hearts, saying,
[1:46:47] "Lord, shine your light on
[1:46:50] me is everything about
[1:46:54] me the way you wanted me to look at this
[1:46:57] stage of my journey before the coming of
[1:46:59] the
[1:47:00] Lord. You sent your prophet and you
[1:47:03] unveiled this for a reason.
[1:47:09] Lord, I don't want to be like the
[1:47:11] Hebrews that times where I should be a
[1:47:14] teacher and I have need to be taught of
[1:47:16] the very first
[1:47:18] things. Lord, I I want to be I want my
[1:47:21] heart to be wide open to you. Teach me,
[1:47:24] Lord. I know that's the way I feel
[1:47:28] tonight. Teach me,
[1:47:31] Lord. If you feel that way, why don't
[1:47:33] you just tell him before we dismiss this
[1:47:35] evening?
[1:47:37] in your own way,
[1:47:40] Lord. Reveal yourself to
[1:47:44] me. And I don't want to leave it all on
[1:47:46] you. I know that I've got to prepare my
[1:47:48] heart, Lord. I I know that I've got to
[1:47:51] take the
[1:47:53] time, not just push the tape when I'm
[1:47:56] going to sleep, but push push push play
[1:47:59] and
[1:48:00] really hear what you're saying to us.
[1:48:08] Lord, remove the scales from my eyes. If
[1:48:10] there's somebody here or even in the in
[1:48:13] the ether there
[1:48:17] internet, you're you're needing the Lord
[1:48:20] to help you. Maybe you're still you've
[1:48:22] got some questions. Well, that's okay.
[1:48:25] If he's if you're the elect and the Lord
[1:48:28] wants you to see it, there's nothing
[1:48:30] wrong with telling the
[1:48:32] Lord. Help me. If this is of you,
[1:48:35] vindicate it to
[1:48:37] me. He had to do it to me. I was a
[1:48:41] Pentecostal boy who had seen many, many
[1:48:47] miracles, but I had to have a revelation
[1:48:50] to me.
[1:48:53] I needed God to visit with
[1:48:56] me. Now, Lord Jesus, we just ask that
[1:48:59] you would take
[1:49:01] us. I lay my heart wide open before you
[1:49:05] tonight. First of all, Lord, forgive me
[1:49:08] of my
[1:49:10] sins, my transgressions.
[1:49:15] Lord, forgive me my nonchan attitude
[1:49:19] toward your
[1:49:20] word, your message, your
[1:49:25] messenger. Let your
[1:49:27] word, let your fire, holy fire, ignite
[1:49:31] my heart again.
[1:49:34] Lord, renew us, Lord, as a
[1:49:37] congregation. Renew our hearts to your
[1:49:41] word. We give ourselves to you now.
[1:49:46] I pray Lord that you would just take
[1:49:48] everything, every opinion, everything of
[1:49:51] me. Lord, let it let it be laid aside.
[1:49:55] Let thus sayaeth the Lord rule my mind
[1:49:59] and my
[1:50:02] heart. I thank you for it,
[1:50:05] Father. I ask Lord that you would do the
[1:50:09] same young and old.
[1:50:12] Let the blessings of the Lord be upon
[1:50:16] each. Oh God, we thank you for what
[1:50:20] you've given to us in this
[1:50:22] day. We love you with all of our
[1:50:27] heart in the name of
[1:50:30] Jesus. Amen. Amen.
