and um man appreciate brother Caleb feeling in there for brother Austin tonight amen and um we looking forward to the Revival this weekend starting tomorrow night there in Claremore and I don't know what's going to be a wonderful time sounds like they're going to have quite a few coming in and so that's good I want I'd like to say a place packed out amen and um so we ministered last Wednesday night the mysterious one walking in the midst of the candlesticks and so we want to we didn't get to we didn't get very far and so let's look here at Revelations 1 and 10. I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day now this is this is something we've got to keep in mind amen the spirit of the Lord had lifted John up into the Lord's day he is seeing things that amen uh as as they would transpire all the way up uh to the Rapture after the Rapture the Millennium amen and so it says the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha Omega the first and the last what thou seeest write in a book and send it into the seven seven churches which are in Asia and to Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thotara Sardis Philadelphia and under laodicea and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as flames of fire his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you today for the wonderful presence that we feel we're thankful Lord that we can come together and you know these Wednesday evenings Lord and father to to share our praise with one another to you and and then ultimately Lord to hear from you and I know Lord It's there's it's a reciprocation Lord that comes you you deserve every song that we sing everything that we say about you you deserve it to Be Sung and prayed Lord with from the depths of our soul and Lord we so long to hear from you and Lord that's that's worth more to us than than the highlight of the week and I'm just asking Lord that you would just pull back the cover on your word and but Lord pull back the cover on our hearts as well and let us see exactly the way you intended it Lord to be seen as as you showed it to John oh God what a wonderful day we're living in and how excited we are to to be able to know you and and to learn of your Mysteries Lord father who anyone can pull back the pages anyone can read Lord that has eyesight but father I'm asking for Spiritual revelation let it be in every one of us and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and a man God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen so we're we're so thankful to the Lord for his word amen how many loves the Bible amen how many loves Bible studies I love Bible studies amen I I was I was teaching Bible studies when I was amen I I my wife and I when we had first met um amen we were when I got my license and and I'd come over her place where she was about an hour away and um take my brother with me he was my chaperone and we we would go out and and finding somebody to witness to and somebody to have Bible studies with I mean that was that was just exciting to me is to try to get somebody to uh to to see the uh the way of life and things hadn't changed too much I'm a little bit older these days and hopefully have a little bit better understanding than what I had when I was a kid but uh uh we got to see a lot of souls touched and saved um even even with with a little bit of experience that we had had at 15 and 16 years old and and um so I've always enjoyed the the setting of a um of a Bible study and so um we want to hear tonight if you've got uh you know always write down questions and I know sometimes we can we we can uh we can come and hit hit pretty hard this last Sunday uh preaching on predestination that's that's a that's a that's a deep subject and um uh it you you can it can leave questions sometimes as well you know then what's the need of praying uh if everything is predestinated amen you've got to understand the way that God has ordained it and what and what God has done we pray according to the will of God Amen we are seeking his will we are fighting for his will amen and his will is for healing his will is for deliverance and so we're not taking away human responsibility whatsoever in fact amen we are a free moral agency and and that's that's that's you you say free moral agency and then predestinated yes amen but but I I I want to tell you I've got a choice Amen to thrive in the ways of God thrive in the Bible blessings of God thrive in the word of God or I can be one of those Christians that just go to heaven amen by the by the skin of my teeth amen there's one thing that a that a Son of God will never be and that's the serpent seed amen that's one thing that a Son of God cannot be he cannot be the serpent or one of the serpents children the seed is different amen an apple seed has given has been given permission by God to produce apples and the Son of God that has got God's word seed in his heart has permission from God to heal the sick raise the dead believe the word now now whatever what however lazy you want to be as the Son of God Amen or however diligent you want to be as a Son of God you will be accountable before God someday amen are y'all are y'all understanding so God has placed us here as a witness amen so just because I say well I'm predestinated I'm just going to ride on the winds until I get to heaven amen I've got a work to do and I I want to fulfill my purpose here on the earth and so but but any of these kinds of things can can come in and you know any of these kind of questions I always say Amen write them down and ask those questions and uh and and if we don't have the answer we'll just tell you we'll just we'll we'll go find the answer amen and so um on these so we we we talked a little bit this last uh Wednesday night of course on the the the Christ walking in the midst of his church throughout seven periods so we found out that the that the seven uh candlesticks represented seven distinct periods of time amen throughout the church history from the time that Christ left to the time that Christ returns so from the time that Christ ascended on high and then from to the time that Christ comes and calls his bride home there will be seven distinct periods that are characterized by seven churches in there in Asia so you'll take those you'll take each of the characteristics of of each one of those churches and and and there was a there is something special about that church that that uh Christ is pointing out to John and saying now listen this is going to be a characteristic that is going to be coming through and down Through the Ages so so we we we're thankful for that now so we'll get into that a little bit later on as far as the amen the timetable and and that sort of thing but so we we we look there at the at the golden lamp stands and how that they received their life from the same Bowl y'all remember that amen so and and and and so you have the seven candlesticks amen uh that the seven seven lamp stands that were that were here and and then you had then you had a a bow amen uh and then you had a tree uh uh uh uh Hallelujah there is that better amen these girls got on to me there okay so then they're receiving their life that they're receiving their life flow from the new in the Old Testament and there's where you get your there's where you get your lights amen so the holy spirit is the oil and every one of the church ages are receiving life from that same Source the anointing can you say Amen so we we learned that amen that we we got into that this last week and so amen it is God continuing amen uh his work from church to church when Jesus left that physical body went to heaven but now there is a mystical body that would go from uh uh through seven Church ages and we would each make up that body we are members of that body so there is a bride that is called in every one of these ages there there is a bride in this age and when they died they were sealed under the message of that age amen then there was a bride that was called and the message of this saint and when they died they were sealed away in that message same Holy Spirit and it came all the way down until in this age this will be the rapturing age and when we rap when we come and reach that point where he's coming after us that all of the pride that is in each one of these ages will rise up first and we will be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air amen so we are it's an incredible thing you are the finality you are the one that is going to actually step into that place and bring Redemption to its finality it didn't happen in the first didn't happen in the second the third they all died believing for the promise you and I have received a message you and I have are the ones with the book that has been released unveiled to show you you're it [Applause] these all lived in symbols you live in reality you're living in the reality where the sea where the the symbols are opened up amen or Kyle and I was talking about your Bible falling apart amen mine does the same thing praise the Lord so so where it's a wonderful It's a Wonderful story now tonight if we can do this um I want us to look at some nuggets here in in this amen as we look at the uh at the seven-fold uh Glory of his person amen and so this personage is remember when we talk about a personage it is a it's a character in a play or a man it's all it's a word that is often used to express uh a person's significance or importance or elevated status and so amen we we asked last week who this mysterious one is and the Mysterious one was lacking to the son of man he was the Living Word the logos that is giving life and giving inspiration to each one of those churches amen did y'all catch that amen so amen where was John seeing these things now in his body John was on the Isle of Patmos he had been exiled there because they thought he was a witch and so they were trying to kill him so they they couldn't kill him they tried to ball him for 24 hours and oil they couldn't kill John amen well they weren't going to kill John because he was predestinated to bring this book of Revelation so God allowed him to be exiled on the Isle of Patmos with a bunch of criminals and and snakes and scorpions and amen and and there is where God came and appeared unto John man but the Bible says that while he was there physically that he was caught up in the spirit on the Lord's Day now now what a deal what a deal amen now here he is you know and that just that should that should be something for every one of us amen you might be on your Isle of Patmos it might look like you are you are in the worst of the worst and the worst and even right there in the worst you can still be in the spirit on the Lord's Day Hallelujah it pays to keep your attitude right even when things are going wrong amen can you say Amen so so he was in the spirit on the Lord's day now I I want us to look here as John examines this uh amen this mysterious one in in in the in here in these verses now Amen brother Bradham would tell us that he is seeing the judge he is seeing the judge amen these characteristics that we're fixing to show here amen he is he has seen the son of man amen the one that was the Living Word the one that was the intercessor the one who was the lamb the one who was the high priest is now the is now the judge can you say Amen now now if you look there where he talks about how that mean man uh and you see there in in amen the 13th verse and then it says you know he's the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Gert about perhaps with a golden girdle now about the paps now the the the the the priest always wore his sash or his girdle around his waist amen that was that that was a sign of service in fact the ephod that went over the shoulders of the high priest and and would and would come down down amen it was the girdle it was a long it was a wide belt that would come in amen and and it would actually give strength to his back as he's picking up the the Lambs as he is sacrificing it was the girdle was was always War uh by that priest Jesus uh Jesus showed when he come to his disciples amen at the Lord's at the Last Supper well they do he gird himself around the waist with a towel so he was he was in serving his disciples amen he he was a servant he and and so but when you look here it's no longer around his waist but it's around his shoulders around his breast area amen it has now changed he is no longer the priest but now the authority rests upon his shoulders he is a judge amen and so now so I want us to just look a little bit here amen that now reading that that 14th verse and his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow so I want us to look here white as snow a man his hair what did John see now this is this is what this is the first thing after he looked and he saw the griddle around his around his shoulder now he is looking at the white hair and and so now a lot of people want to say now uh brother Branham was curious when he was when he seen this it just he asked the theologians around these said now what does white hair mean what and so Jack Moore says well that was in his glorified body amen he was glorified and so now his hair is white and and but it didn't it just didn't quite make sense to to brother Branham and then one day the angel Lord told Brother Branham you are seeing him in in the position of Judge that hair represents wisdom amen and it it means amen experience and maturity and so I ask you here today can God age no God can't age but God is wise God is amen uh he has he has all experience he's the Fountain of Eternal wisdom can you say Amen now I I I want you to I want you to catch us for a moment because when God appeared in our day remember when the when the angel of the Lord when the cloud came and appeared at the opening of the seals Amen in that Vision that brother Branham had he noticed he he noted that that seventh angel amen it was it was it was an incredible Angel how how that that angel amen uh was uh it was just out it stood out to him and he comes back with a vision he tells exactly how the vision uh what happened and he goes I don't understand this he said these angels came there were seven dots that just came and they came so quick and by the time they materialized they were Angels they picked me up there was an explosion he tells the story well when they then when the picture is taken and that's the picture that that was taking taken right there of course that's just a painting but if you'll notice that seventh angel any man which was representing our day it acted as a wig over the head of Christ it formed the head of Christ when when the Lord told him he says look it is it is declaring Hoffman's head of Christ so in in symbolic form brother Branham was looking there amen and then all of a sudden the pieces begin to come together and he says yes the judges used to always a judge I don't care whether he's 30 years old or whether he's 40 or whether he's 50 he would put a white wig over his head that was part that was part of what the judge done when he came in to the courtroom so he had his robe but he always come and and they still and then and I I uh they're in the English judges especially they would put the white wig on which represented wisdom experience righteousness amen it was it was a it was a judge who was coming a man uh to to judge the situation I want us to go just real quickly over here to Daniel and um if we'd go Daniel the seventh chapter praise the Lord let's see um all right so Daniel 7 and 9. and it says and I beheld y'all still find it we'll we'll wait we'll wait till you get there I want you all I want you all to be able to look at that it's hard to find Daniel sometimes in the Old Testament amen praise the Lord I I think this is beautiful because this is showing the Judgment it says I beheld to the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool and his throne was like the fiery flame and and his wheels as burning fire now fiery stream issued fourth issued and come forth from before him and thousands thousands Minister unto him that's the bride and Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand stood before him this is the Judgment of the good and the bad and the Judgment was set and the books were open so Daniel Court a lot of Daniels actually Daniel's prophecy and visions and the and and uh uh John's prophecy and Visions they they correlate together it's talking about the Gentiles and the Gentile church now John sees though the uh the white hair on the son of man amen and now the uh uh uh uh Daniel is saying that he sees the Ancient of Days that has uh this this white hair as white as wool they're seeing the same thing now I want us to look I want us to really catch this again how how can you how you you you you know how how can you uh look at an eternal one and say does God age God does not age God's not an old man God is God he never began he'll never end God doesn't have good days bad days God doesn't have the flu God is God so this is expressing the Eternal Fountain of wisdom which is God and God Alone amen so now when you look at this where this white hair here in Daniel it is talking about the Judgment this is the judging of of the uh of the world now and it says in the 11th verse um is it's you know the Judgment was set the books were open 11th verse and I beheld then because the voice of uh the great words which the horns spake I beheld even till this the Beast was slain and his body destroyed we went through that a couple of uh Sundays ago talking about that they're in Revelations 13th chapter his body destroyed and given to the Burning Flame as concerning the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away their lives were prolonged for a season in time and I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all the people Nations languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed this is talking about the judge there is no more a lamb this is no more this is no more a high priest Mercy is over there's no more forgiveness there's nothing left they are now in judgment can you say Amen now notice who is ministering to him and who is standing before him amen the the Saints the bride are not in this judgment the Saints are standing beside him the scripture says that the Saints shall judge the world what can you say amen amen so the Saints would judge the world so in and and I'll give you uh amen praise the Lord I I'll give you another uh scripture here amen uh they're in in Saint John 6 and 44 it says no man hey man you can turn there I'll wait praise the Lord do you love him this is this is beautiful and I'm I'm fixing to show you now we have we have really been pushing or really been trying to stress the importance of us understanding the work of that lamb us understanding amen this the the the Father the Eternal God building himself a body a man to in order to redeem his people back to him there is no judgment to the bride because Christ has taken her judgment praise the Lord John 6 and 44 says no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day now let's also go back to John 5 and 24. that's this the the chapter before verily verily I say unto you he that hears my word believeth on him that sent me half now does that does that say is going to have everlasting life or does do they already have everlasting life believeth on him that's in me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or judgment but his past from Death unto life if Christ has already lost you cleansed you then how can he bring you into judgment you are standing in judgment by his word tonight it was the word made flesh to die for you to purchase you back to him well praise the Lord so that Brother winner how do I know that I'm that I am there how do I know that the Saints are there that are ministering unto that lamb well they're in First Corinthians 6 and 2 it says and you you can turn it I'll wait praise the Lord amen amen well I trust everyone has been doing good this week amen there in First Corinthians 6 and 10 when you're there Say Amen if you need more time just say need more time it says do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life now that backs up that backs up the scripture there in in Revelations 3 and 21 talking and this is talking to you and me amen he that overcomes amen will I grant that's Revelations 3 and 21 will I grant to set with me in my throne even as I have overcome and set with uh in my father's Throne can you say Amen so so we we when we talk about now if you would go amen back to Daniel and remember a fiery stream issued and and came forth before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand stood before him and the Judgment was set and the books were open so here we stand out now today we are being judged by the word today we're taking the blood of Jesus Christ and applying that to Our Lives can you say Amen now we don't want to get off we don't want to get a lose track of where we're at here I just wanted to to bring this in now now remember First Timothy let's just turn this real quickly this this just came to me there in first Timothy 5 I believe it is history keys uh uh first first Timothy 5 and 24 . praise the Lord some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men's they follow after all right so here here we are so so we want to take care of our sins while we have a merciful high priest today amen now while we've got this merciful high priest we want to take care of our sins today repent of our sins don't hide sins under uh uh you know don't sweep it under the rug don't don't be listen that's the worst thing you could ever do is hide sins from your spouse hide sins from your mom and dad hide sins from God listen we've got a high priest that is there for the confession of our mouth we must confess our sins and put them under the blood don't wait till the rapture you know I believe someone was telling me the other day that some people believe that there'll there'll still be Souls getting you know people get saved that would actually you know sort of feel like maybe we might all be going through the tribulation listen I am washing my garments right now amen I don't have to go through the tribulation to believe the word of the Lord I believe in the word right now I'm taking my soul seriously right now can you say man now now there ain't going to be no one receiving the Holy Ghost after the Rapture takes place there ain't gonna be no one now there might be a lot of people speaking in tongues amen because the devil can impersonate tongues he can impersonate prophecies he can impersonate anything is that right but he cannot he cannot impersonate the word and he cannot impersonate a heart to receive the word in humility amen so I want to be humble somebody say Lord Make Me humble amen make me humble so so the position in this position here the position of the lamb and the high priest is over he is now standing as a judge the wind one is standing there as a judge amen there's no more atoning lamb there's no more priest offering blood for the people the mediator role is finished folks the mediator roll is over amen now the Sun the body the purpose for Christ's coming will deliver amen the kingdom that he has redeemed all of the sons that he has redeemed he'll deliver that back to the father and we'll say now amen these are all trophies can you say Amen now now now you're saying here we are we're going back to two again you've got to understand the role that God is playing it's one God using a body to redeem his people back to him so when you see the Ancient of Days with white hair and then you see the son of man in Revelations with white hair the Ancient of Days has the white hair and Daniel the son of man is the one how can the Sun have white hair I thought it was it's all the same we've got to understand the role I believe it was uh sister Nadine that brought it out last a couple Wednesday nights ago uh beautifully and that was amen it's the it's it's it's the chain I am a father I am a son I am a human being but my name is Wendell as as a role as son to Colby it's not the same role as a husband to my wife amen so I play a man it's it's it's it's different it's God putting on a veil of Flesh to accomplish only what God can do can you say man his purpose is to redeem you back to himself and when we get there to Heaven hallelujah amen well the scripture let's let's look let's let's let's find it here let's go to First Corinthians amen that's my problem here I can tell we're not going to get all this first Corinthians 15 and since we're not going to get this if anyone's got anything just go ahead and bring it out praise the Lord let's see First Corinthians 15. and um 21 for Since By Man Came Death by man also by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as Adam as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then come at the end somebody say then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he hath put down all Rule and all and all authority and Power for he must Reign now this word rain amen is is is actually in his high priest over his sons and daughters he's got to intercede for them until he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be delivered is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he that he ex that he has accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all now you say now now brother window this this can this can really be confused the scripture says great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh so what are you talking about there will come a time amen when the church ages will be up there will come a time amen where it will it was the interceding work of a lamb for these seven Church ages there will come a time when the work of the lamb and the church will be totally over it'll be totally gone Redemption will be complete there will be no no reason for a lamb there will be no reason for a high priest there will be no we will be back to where Adam was before the fall so what God did what what the Apostle Paul said there's coming a time where this will all be complete you will be home I will be home Christ has stood there until the very last of God's children that he died for has made it home I want to tell you right now God is waiting amen for that last one to come in even right now and when that last one comes in brother it's over come on now he's not going to lose one Christ said I will not lose one I will not lose one no man will put them out of my hand he's there in that Redemptive role God's body is playing that role but there comes a time where it is no longer it is no longer Calvary it is no longer a lamb it is no longer a high priest now it'll be the lion of the tribe of Judah are y'all seeing how it is God that that is that is looking there okay let's let's look here let's let's look here at John or at uh Revelations 5. praise the Lord amen they're in in Revelations five and five and one of the elders said unto me weep not John we not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and the four Beast and the midst of the elders stood a lamb it was King lamb it was God the Great Mighty King the Great Mighty judge becoming a lamb what John is showing that we're just looking at is now the interstate a session days are over and now it is it is the judge that is there amen and when I want to tell you don't stand before the judge in that day those who have rejected his blood those who have rejected his word those who have rejected his his atoning work to live in sin there will be no Calvary then it will be the lion the King right now the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he come in a body as a lamb sacrificial man but he's going to go back as the lion someday to claim his purchased work are y'all understanding it's Christ in two roles it is Christ putting it's God putting on the the the the the uh the veil of the body to buy Redemption but he's going to go back as judge someday Hallelujah but I got some good news for you did you know when you get to heaven God's always going to have that body God's always going to be a man you're going to be able to fellowship with God in the body of Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah well I love that amen so so amen so the scripture says that he must Reign or he is he is it playing the lamb has got to play the son the high priest has got to stay in that position until death has been conquered for all of God's Fallen seed but when that comes brother hallelujah amen we're just gonna how about one more sister Keys amen uh Hebrews 10 and 11. 11. before we go any further amen he's looking for the end of it he's looking for the time God is looking for the time where he is no longer having to intercede When sin and death will totally be over Hallelujah the Bible says I'm fixing to show you the Bible says he's expecting it Hebrews 10 and 11. praise the Lord it says every high priest standeth daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God expect and from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified so say Amen so here here we are amen he's expecting he's expecting he came for one purpose that's to redeem God's Fallen Sons and Daughters that's all that listen and he ain't going to lose one of them amen amen now listen if God is pulling at your heart tonight you ought to be thankful for that we should never have to be you should never have to beat anyone over the head and tell them you better live right and you'd better do right you're a Son of God you were in a jail cell you were held by the enemy that tricked up tripped up uh your your mama amen Eve years ago and has held you as a slave I mean just just the same as the slaves of the past and and you're hailed as a slave you are not a criminal you are not a condemned you have been kidnapped you are living as a slave Jesus God looked down to his children and said the only way that I'm going to be able to get them out of slavery is for me to give my life so he had to become one but he wasn't a Slave he was one that came down and paid the price he died for you died for me took the penalty so that you and I can go back are y'all hearing me and he ain't leaving one behind amen Hallelujah and Buddy on that day on that day every spirit that has tried to hold his children down every spirit that has tried to keep them in bondage all of these you know guys it's promoting this you know marijuana and this is these cigarettes and all this porn and and all of these that have tried to keep on that day when each steps is judged buddy he's going to bring he's going to bring recompense to every man and woman that has that that that has defiled his sons and daughters he's going to stand up and judge the world for their filth he's doing it for the sake the Bible says he will avenge the elect praise the Lord that should make you want to shout amen all right so so how many are y'all with me any questions anything you want to add praise the Lord yeah yeah that's right I believe I believe they're still Sons and Daughters outside that that are lost in sin that needs to come to Christ they might be in a denomination somewhere amen now now when I hit denomination so hard I am not hitting the people in the denomination I'm talking I'm talking about men using their bylaws to keep Sons and Daughters of God in bondage and they'll get up there with their feel-good gospel making them feel like they're okay and they're saved amen and lying to them and and that's not the people's fault that's that's those that's those systems of men who have substituted the word of God for this well the reason why we're here we the way we are right now is because the word has been substituted over and over and over until you can't even find a church that even looks resembles halfway of what the Bible uh teaching was right so it's not it's not the people in the denominator I believe there are Christians that are in the denominations I do but I'm going to tell you something right now amen for a Rapture they're going to have to wash their souls with the washing of the Water by the word and man's interpretation telling them well it don't matter it does matter we're sons of God and we line up with the word of God can you say Amen so it's important that we line ourselves up and don't listen to some kind of a you know two before preacher or some doctor or pulp or you know a TV evangelist or anybody that that that wants to substitute the word of God in any way we stand for the word of God because the blood of Jesus has washed us amen or has redeemed us so that we can believe every word of God so yes the seed of God is here amen my wife my wife was a was a Baptist you know amen and and her family her her family were you know we're uh I mean they were some pretty rough characters drug dealers and stuff over there man and uh you know uh and yet the Lord amen sent me over that way to rescue her amen well actually amen my pastor my pastor had a burden to go go her to community with with a tent and we set up the tent and her and her brother came to the Lord and the Lord's savior now that's God that's Jesus Jesus says I I've come for my own he said and I've got some sheep of another pasture that I'm going to come after too and he knows where to find you and how to find you I don't care if whether you're in a ballroom I don't care whether you're in it don't matter if you're his he's coming after you he's coming after you can you say amen hallelujah so amen so we're thankful for that all right let's look at this now the next thing that the next thing was eyes as the flame of fire now if you look there it says his head is his head and his hair is white like wool a white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire now think of it the eyes that were once dimmed with tears of Sorrow and agony the one that was they wept with compassion over the grave of Lazarus the one that looked over Jerusalem with compassion and say Jerusalem Jerusalem if you'd only known your hour of visitation and he wept he says how come to bring you in as a end of The Brood all right those eyes that cried or that wept they're in the garden the the the the one that looked down those eyes that looked down upon the murderous men that were beating him flogging him driving his his hands Nails into his hands and those eyes that were looking and he would still look and say father forgive them those those I eyes that moved with compassion are now a flame of fire it is Vengeance in his eyes they're now the eyes of a judge who will recompense those who rejected him now think about it amen of all the characteristics the human characteristics amen that Jesus had and and the human emotions he cried often yet behind the weeping behind the sorrow was God God was living in that body to redeem it was God in the body of Jesus saying oh Jerusalem Jerusalem now it is God standing there through those eyes of fire and judgment Jesus said there in in John a sixth chapter he says if you don't believe that I am he you'll die in your sins is that right amen you'll die in your sins and he was constantly there and we can look there at John 10 and 37. amen John 10 and 37 praise the Lord if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not but if I do though ye believe me not believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him it was God redeeming well praise the Lord as Jeremiah of old Jeremiah was the weeping prophet Jesus was a weeping prophet that was God crying those tears amen but now now Mercy's over praise the Lord because he wasn't there just to read he's there he's there to bring as many to eternal life the Bible the Bible clearly says amen that he wants all to come he wants all to be safe he's come after his and he's coming after all as many of the whosoever wills that will come with us that's what the Bible says the foolish virgin he's he's offering them eternal life 144 000 Jews he's offering them eternal life he's even offering eternal life to anybody that is just good to the elect that's what he says there in Matthew 25 amen when the judgment is open he's going to tell him you you he says I was hungry and you fed me I was not kidding you called me I was this and and he and and and and he's took he says enter into the joys of the Lord and they said when did we ever do that he says when you've done this to one of these that are mine you've done it to me and I'm going to give you eternal life because of that that judgment is not that's the second gen that's the white Throne judgment look at it you are his bride and yet God on that day is offering eternal life to because God is merciful and he loves his people and he loves people he wants every man to be saved but will they accept it we're living in a day where they're so far against God and so far against his word oh they want to believe God the way they want to believe it but they don't want to accept and he's the word so don't say that you love Jesus and you hate his word if you love The Christ you'll love the word of the Christ for he is the Living Word praise the Lord amen whole church don't don't sit here don't sit in this building here and just let things go and just and just let the friends make your salvation real love God with all of your heart amen and not just what if you love him you'll keep my Commandments if you love him you're gonna you're gonna come to his word and brother this word should mean more to us than anything else in the world amen because those fiery eyes are now amen they're they're now he's the judge those eyes are recording the lives of all the inhabitants of the earth they run to and fro the scripture says looking for hearts that are perfect toward him he knows the desire of the heart amen he sees all things nothing is hidden from him there in Hebrews 4 and 13 it says neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do those eyes are searching out to bring us Redemption can you say Amen if you're going to be there in that let's let's look at your uh Romans the second chapter amen and we'll we'll wind this up here in just a minute praise the Lord Romans the second chapter and um if um I think the uh let's just let's just break in here so we can just get this part it's the fourth verse or despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance but after thy hardness and in penitent heart treasurous up thyself wrath against the day of Wrath and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance and well-doing seek for glory honor and Immortal immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul that doeth evil of the Jew first and also to the Gentile but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the Gentile for God for there is no respect of persons with God amen so this is the judge this is the judge this is now the the the the Mercy's over we're now standing before the Judgment seat of God can you say Amen now the Bible talked about the long-suffering of the long-suffering of God going back waiting for that lack waiting for the looking for that elect amen look at look at First Peter 3 and 20. you don't have to turn well yeah go ahead and turn there amen I just want to hurt him get this finished here before I before we leave amen First Peter 1 uh first Peter 3 and 20. now and he's talking about uh a Noah and and I want you to watch here I want you the way I I love the way this was this was done God sent amen uh uh the God sent a a way of safety a provision for the for this for the house of Noah the righteous people on the Earth God gave that but listen but he was also looking for those giving others a chance now Noah was the one that God the Bible says no one is family amen there was no other righteous and yet God was merciful offering to allow anyone to come into that boat to allow Ed into yeah but they refused it because they didn't believe it the way Noah believed it when God sends us a prophet to show us his word and say this is where you need to be looking I would I I there ain't going to be too many people come into that boat because what they're thinking is the boat what they're thinking is Christ is a million a million miles off of it millions and men's men's ideologies and these dogmas and everything that got Christ so mixed up there is a real Christ folks there is a real Jesus Christ that is calling us he's long-suffering can you say amen he says which sometimes we're disobedient when Once the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark Was preparing we're in view that is eight Souls were saved by water but God deliberately held off and held off and hell off but there's going to come a time where judgment strikes and God was not willing that any should perish and he wanted the world to come but that didn't mean that they came can you say Amen amen let's look here at second Peter 3 and 9. amen praise the Lord the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some in Council Agnes but is what long suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen Hallelujah you love him now listen amen and and if if if God is so merciful think about it if the holy spirit is here today and God has sent us a message like he promised he would and and God promised he would send Elijah Amen to the spirit of Elijah the fire of God would come down and vindicate it exactly the way it was in the in in the Old Testament times when the pillar of fire would come down and to prove that Elijah was right Elijah in the Old Testament was sent there for the Jezebels amen he condemned The Jezebel he killed her prophets he'd done all these things and then the holiest you know the holy spirit that He restored the altar and then God says that I'm going to send you Elijah the Prophet The Book of Revelations the second the the the the the second and third chapter talks about the Jezebel system that comes in those Church ages The Jezebel begins to try to Reign God comes in its promises and then in the last days before the coming of the Lord he's going to send that to Elijah with the same Pillar of Fire that would condemn that Jezebel system and then we not be willing to open our hearts in humility and say God I don't want any of Jezebel a part of me I want I don't want the Jezebel church I don't want I don't want that great that I want to be I want your blood I want you to wash me I want you to purify my mind and my heart I don't want none of that junk on me Elijah has come rebuilt the altar at the evening sacrifice the Bible said are you hearing me take this thing serious be serious with your walk now is the world going to accept it no no no because they're just as they think they're right they think they're right even after the coming of the Lord even after the coming of the lord The Book of Revelations there's several places when the vials are being poured out how many has ever read that they're in Revelations the 17th chapter where the vials are being poured out and God's given them a chance Hallelujah and and and and there's and they're cussing God Revelations the 17th chapter amen if I can get to the 17th yeah or the 16th chapter I'm sorry amen now now these are the vials that are all being poured out that's that's the Judgment this is the Judgment of the that's coming this is what he's talking about now hey man it's talking about there's annoying some Grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them that worshiped the image and and it's going down all the you know these these vials that are being and look down at the ninth verse and men were scorched with great Heat and blasphemed the name of God which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seed of the Beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the god of Heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds there's not a heart of repentance the only kind of repentance that's going to be left folks is those that's going to make a rapture and we want to look at our hearts and say amen I want to be everything can you say Amen amen Hallelujah if you go back to the ninth verse this is talking about the plagues he's the bottomless pit you know being being opened up and amen it's it's it it's part of the same it's it's in that tribulation time that they're in in nine and twenty and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of the hands that they should not worship devils and Idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood and which you could neither have seen or hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders their sorceries their fornications nor of their thefts I'm saying we're living in the day we're the judge or the judge is going to be a judge it's not going to be it's not going to be the lamb anymore if we if we if we try to amen put our lives if we if we try to if we can sit in a church folks if we can sit in a church and allow the devil to use us and anoint us when we've got the blood of Jesus Christ why would we do that because true repentance is to turn around and go the opposite direction can you say man Lord give us a heart to repent he came for you and me because we're the only ones that can repent the elect of God are the only ones that want to be right serpents children don't want to be right amen is that right amen praise the Lord all right what what now anything that I that I need to clarify before we close here tonight amen we only got to the second one amen praise the Lord but I want hey I'd rather take her time and just but he got questions holler out here real quick amen praise the Lord so this he was in the spirit on the Lord's day the Lord is showing him now he's showing him the judge the Supreme judge pretty it's just incredible how Supernatural God does things so so incredible this message is so incredible amen amen so now it's the eyes of Fire amen you could go to their book Revelations the the 21st chapter and we find out that now he's ruling with a rod of iron now he's he's got indignation but today he's full of Mercy he's full of love and he is full of love for his people Hallelujah I would get into church age book I I'd get in that church age book and read that thing man I'm going to tell you there are theologians there are theologians that that that book that book is an all-in-one buddy no no I'd go to the church age book and and read and start off there and just just really and and just really take that amen the it starts off with the revelation of Jesus Christ and the Patmos vision and that church age book has is loaded with history and what we're fixing to be going through in these in in this in the seven Church ages I mean it is it is got so much history uh and of the church and and how Satan has fought all down through those ages and I tell you what I I you know I I personally believe that that the purpose for god-bringing uh sending us brother Branham was was first to identify amen those Church ages and those seals that's his message that's his message what we're what we're teaching here is is something for us to be able to see get clear eyes where we're at amen the the scripture says that that that that religious tree would become would be that their their Revelations would be full of every foul and hateful bird all under the name of religion and you would have never known that ever you know everyone wants to put it to Muslim brother Brian said no no it's that Jezebel system it's that Roman Catholic Church that started in the beginning and now it's it was a covering over the people instead of the covering of the word and it was covering of men and brother I'm gonna I don't know you look at what brother Branham taught there and now you look at where we're at today and you think oh if he did not see this day and bring it out precisely he said the U.S would go total Anarchy the religious I it's just it's just incredible it's just incredible how accurate the Holy Spirit has been in this day amen yes yeah yeah I yeah do we do we have church age books here up there yeah we've got some Churches so anyone who wants Church age but I'd encourage everyone um and I don't think I don't think these kids are too young for for that uh that's one of the reasons I want to just go over to just slowly and simply and because we've got these youngins that are coming up too yeah that's right yep amen and that is and that is good yeah and that is that is true I I you know I I'm just I'm just I'm so thankful I'm I'm so some you know I I've heard people say well you know it's just hard for me to it's just hard for me to Rejoice that I'm the one Chosen and other people are going to hell you were his son for Kobe to turn around and say well it's just hard for me to to to say that I'm I'm Wendell Martin's son when there's others that's not his son are you kidding he was in my he was in my loins he's my son when you came out of the loins of God you came out from the loins of God the

uh I I I love I love the Lord and I think that in everything that we do and all of our all of our learning is we don't want to hear or want in our eyes this eyes of our heart to see who we are and who he is and when you see that Revelation just starts it Revelation just simply breaks the chains over your over your faith because your faith can only go so far as your revelation But as God reveals himself then all of a sudden you begin to see things oh Lord here I am me and you this is special this is really special amen we're thankful we're thankful to have a knowledge but the greatest thing is to have that witness in our heart something in there I said Lord I just the more that I know you the more that I want to love you the more I want to express myself to you love you with all of my heart that's the way I am tonight I love him with all of my heart amen for everything that is I want to love him more I think there's still room to love him more cutting it off now we're living in a
