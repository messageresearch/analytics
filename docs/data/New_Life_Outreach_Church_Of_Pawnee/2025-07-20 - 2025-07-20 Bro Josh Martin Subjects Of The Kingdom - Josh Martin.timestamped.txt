[3:35] [Music]
[4:24] Amen. Would you stand together with me
[4:26] and sing this chorus?
[4:35] heartache
[4:37] and broken pieces.
[4:42] Ruin lives ruined life
[4:45] [Music]
[4:47] are why
[4:49] he died
[4:52] on Calary.
[4:55] Your

[4:59] is what I long for.
[5:05] You have given
[5:09] life
[5:10] to me. One more time.

[5:18] dates and broken pieces. Broken peace.
[5:23] Oh, ruined lives

[5:37] Your touch
[5:41] is what I long for.

[5:50] the life to
[5:54] me.
[5:55] [Music]
[5:57] Oh, can you testify that you he's given
[6:00] life to you?
[6:02] He come that says because I live, you
[6:05] can live also. Amen. We were born in sin
[6:09] shaping iniquity. Come the world
[6:10] speaking lives lives ruined. Amen. But
[6:15] we were trapped in it. Amen. We didn't
[6:17] have a choice. Amen. But Jesus come that
[6:21] we might be given a choice.
[6:25] Free will, free moral agency.
[6:29] And he came in the flesh 2,000 years ago
[6:32] that they might touch him. A woman with
[6:36] a blood issue of 12 years said, "If I
[6:39] can just touch the hem of his garment,
[6:42] I'll be made whole.
[6:44] didn't even have a scripture to go on.
[6:47] She made up her own scripture.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; She made up her own word, but it was
[6:52] based upon faith because after he
[6:55] touched she touched the hymn of Jesus
[6:57] garment, she felt she was healed
[7:02] and she tried to hide herself. But Jesus
[7:04] said, "Somebody's touched me. Somebody's
[7:08] touched me." And there was a whole crowd
[7:10] around him.
[7:12] And Peter was right there and said,
[7:15] "Lord, everybody's touching you."
[7:19] What would you say such a thing as that,
[7:21] Sister Tracy? Everybody's touching you.
[7:26] But it was a different touch.
[7:29] It was a touch of faith and a belief
[7:32] that this was the son of God to come in
[7:35] the flesh. Amen. That it was a healer.
[7:38] Amen. With his that could be that was
[7:41] his savior. Amen. And it made all the
[7:43] difference in her life. Amen. That she'd
[7:46] put up with for 12 years. The doctors
[7:49] couldn't do it. Doctors couldn't touch
[7:52] that, but Jesus did. And if you have a
[7:55] need this morning, you need you want to
[7:58] be touched, you can be touched. It's up
[8:02] to you. Amen. Your choice this morning.
[8:06] How many's thankful you've already made
[8:08] that choice? Can you give him a praise?
[8:10] Just put your hands together.
[8:13] Oh, thank you, Jesus. He's the same
[8:16] yesterday, today, and forever. If he can
[8:19] be touched then, he can be be touched
[8:22] today. Amen. I believe it because I've
[8:25] been touched. Amen. So, God bless you

[34:16] Sister Titha. Amen. Reach out and touch
[34:19] the Lord.

[34:44] He is pad. Sing by this moment
[34:50] your needs to supply.
[34:54] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord.
[35:00] Oh, when governments fail and kingdoms
[35:02] fail, he'll never fail.
[35:05] So reach out and touch the Lord
[35:11] as he
[35:14] goes by.
[35:17] You will find he's not too busy
[35:22] to hear your heart's cry.
[35:27] He is fast.
[35:30] ing by this moment
[35:33] your needs to
[35:36] supply.
[35:38] Just reach out and touch the Lord. Oh,

[36:11] He is packed. Sing by this moment
[36:17] your needs to
[36:19] supply.
[36:21] Oh, reach out. Oh, you might have to
[36:25] climb a sycamore tree like little
[36:28] Zakius.
[36:29] Oh, but he did it. How about us? Reach
[36:33] out and touch the Lord
[36:38] as
[36:40] [Music]
[36:55] passing
[36:57] by this moment.
[37:00] your needs. He'll
[37:03] supply.
[37:05] Reach out and touch the Lord
[37:10] as he
[37:13] goes by. Can we sing it one more time?
[37:16] Reach out and touch the Lord
[37:21] as he
[37:26] you will find.
[37:28] He's not too busy.
[37:33] Hear your heart's cry.
[37:37] He is passing
[37:40] by this moment.
[37:43] Your needs heal.
[37:46] supply.
[37:49] Shout and touch the Lord
[37:53] as he
[37:56] goes by.
[37:58] [Music]
[38:01] Amen. Do you believe you can touch him
[38:02] this morning?
[38:05] How do you touch him? By your faith.
[38:08] Brother Brand, I'm going to talk about
[38:10] blind Barameus. how that when Jesus was
[38:12] walking by and he would cry out you know
[38:15] uh Jesus son of David have mercy upon me
[38:19] and Jesus stopped and brother Brandham
[38:21] says he didn't hear the voice of la of
[38:23] blamardameus but his faith stopped him
[38:26] and so I believe we can reach out with
[38:28] our faith here this evening and touch
[38:30] the hymn of his garment and the healing
[38:32] virtues of God or the joy the peace
[38:35] deliverance the renewing whatever you
[38:37] have need of you can touch him this
[38:39] morning the Bible says that he can be
[38:41] felt by the touching of our infirmities.
[38:44] He can feel our pain. He can feel our
[38:46] sorrow. And and that's comforting as a
[38:48] as a Christian to know that he he he was
[38:51] tempted like we were tempted yet without
[38:54] sin. So, he knows what it's like to have
[38:56] struggles and sorrows and pains and and
[38:59] have a headache. And he would cry at the
[39:01] tomb of Lazarus because he lost a good
[39:04] friend, but yet he would say, "Lazarus,
[39:06] come forth." He He would bring us
[39:08] humanity under subjection to let you
[39:11] know even when you're sorrowful, there
[39:13] can be an anchor on the inside that can
[39:15] bring you back together and and keep
[39:18] pressing on. Amen. Are you happy to be
[39:20] in the house of the Lord this morning?
[39:23] I know we have a lot missing this
[39:25] morning. Uh I think there's 30 or 40
[39:29] there in uh there in Arkansas. We we got
[39:32] back last night from the meetings there.
[39:34] been wonderful, a wonderful time there.
[39:37] Our pastor preached on Friday night and
[39:39] done a tremendous job. I I was blessed
[39:41] tremendously by it. So, if you y'all
[39:44] would have the time and and we want to
[39:46] listen to it, I know y'all would be
[39:47] blessed as well. And it is good to have
[39:49] all of our visitors here this morning.
[39:51] My goodness, y'all y'all y'all are, you
[39:53] know, making up for all the ones that
[39:55] are gone. So, we just we pray that y'all
[39:57] just feel welcome here among us and and
[40:00] have a a good time here. Pray the Lord
[40:02] can minister to your hearts. Amen. But
[40:05] if you would have your scriptures, let's
[40:06] open our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 9 and
[40:10] 24.
[40:12] Amen. I believe that whatever our need
[40:15] is, God can meet the need. I I was
[40:17] reading a quote last night that I had
[40:19] never seen before, I guess. But brother
[40:20] Brandon would say, "If the church could
[40:23] only know, this is not just the Brandom
[40:25] Tabernacle, but it's the church of the
[40:28] living God." And I thought that is
[40:30] profound. This ain't just new life
[40:32] outreach, but this is the church of the
[40:35] living God. And I believe we have
[40:36] untapped resources at our disposal. But
[40:40] 1 Corinthians 9 and 24.
[40:43] Know ye not that they which run in a
[40:46] race run all, but one receiveth a prize.
[40:50] So run that ye may obtain. And every man
[40:53] that striveth for the master master
[40:55] mastery
[40:56] is temperate in all things. Now they do
[40:59] it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we
[41:02] and uncorruptible. So I therefore so run
[41:06] not as uncertainly. So fight I not as
[41:09] one that beatth the air, but I keep my
[41:11] body and bring it under subjection, lest
[41:14] that by any means when I have preached
[41:16] to others, I myself should be a cast
[41:18] away. Amen. Can we bow our heads this
[41:21] morning? Dear gracious heavenly father,
[41:24] Lord, we're thankful for your your
[41:25] presence that we feel this morning.
[41:27] Lord, we ask that you would just feel
[41:29] welcome here among us and everything
[41:31] that is said and done, Lord. God, we're
[41:33] a needy people and no doubt there's
[41:35] needs here in the in the local body,
[41:38] Lord, here in the church this morning.
[41:40] But God, you're still the the high
[41:41] priest that can be touched, Lord. And I
[41:44] ask, Father, that you would just move
[41:45] among us tonight. Walk the aisles, Lord.
[41:47] Speak to the hearts and to the needs.
[41:49] Lord, we commit the service into your
[41:52] hands in Jesus name. Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this morning. I had
[41:58] another thought. I was going to preach
[42:00] um but this here came upon my heart on
[42:02] the way home yesterday. And so I hope I
[42:05] hope it can be a blessing to you. But my
[42:08] thought would be subjects of the kingdom
[42:10] of God. And brother Brandham would say
[42:12] all Jesus works were was complete.
[42:15] Everything was complete. Total
[42:17] delivered. He totally delivered the
[42:19] leper from the leprosy. Totally
[42:21] delivered the woman with the issue from
[42:23] the blood issue from her issue. He
[42:26] totally delivered the world from sin.
[42:28] When he died on the at the day of the
[42:30] atonement, he totally delivered every
[42:33] sin. He delivered the church. So there's
[42:35] no need for us to live under privileged
[42:38] people. There's no need for us to live
[42:40] in a defeated state because he defeated
[42:43] the devil, took all the principalities
[42:45] and powers and subdued them under his
[42:48] feet. They have no legal rights over
[42:51] you. We are Christians filled with the
[42:53] Holy Ghost. We don't have to be have the
[42:56] devil dictate us. Christ delivered us
[42:58] total deliverance. Delivered us from
[43:01] evil. Delivered us from sin. Delivered
[43:02] us from habits. Delivered us from
[43:04] talking. Delivered us from black art.
[43:06] delivered us from all kinds of smutty
[43:08] things. He totally delivered us and put
[43:12] us into his holy hands. A complete total
[43:16] deliverance. I know that's a a lengthy
[43:19] quote there, but I think that that that
[43:21] is incredible how brother Brandham was
[43:23] putting it. That all his works, Jesus
[43:26] works complete, a total deliverance. And
[43:29] I believe that these things are are more
[43:32] than just uh quotes and more than just
[43:35] uh uh uh just phrases and words, but
[43:37] it's a reality to us. Not just something
[43:40] that we can rejoice around and thank God
[43:42] for a total deliverance. But I believe
[43:45] there's a reality to it. And once that
[43:48] reality anchors in the heart of the
[43:50] believer, brother Brandham tells us
[43:52] there's no need for us to live in a
[43:55] defeated state. There's no need for us
[43:58] to to have the devil dictate us. And I
[44:00] believe that that is a reality that we
[44:03] can live in where our emotions don't
[44:05] have to dictate us or our feelings don't
[44:07] have to dictate us. What we see, what we
[44:10] hear, what we feel, what what we taste.
[44:13] Uh all of these things does not have to
[44:15] dictate us. But there's a total
[44:18] deliverance that we can live in. But it
[44:21] comes by realizing what God has done for
[44:24] us in this generation. And and you
[44:26] remember the story brother Brown would
[44:28] tell of the lady that was living in
[44:30] poverty. A and the and the story would
[44:32] go that this lady would sell all of her
[44:34] furniture for some food. Now she's run
[44:36] out of that food. And there was some the
[44:39] neighbors I believe would would call a
[44:41] charity organization and would say,
[44:42] "Hey, there's a lady, my neighbor, she's
[44:44] old. She needs some help." And so they
[44:46] would sense the investigators over to
[44:48] see if she really needed some help. and
[44:50] they would come into her house and would
[44:52] say, "Uh uh uh do you not have any
[44:55] children?" She would say, "Well, I've
[44:57] got one, you know, but but he's over in
[44:59] India. He's a businessman, and I don't
[45:02] want to bother him with my with my needs
[45:05] and things." And and they would ask her,
[45:07] "Well, how how old are you?" And I
[45:09] believe she was 80 years old, I believe.
[45:12] and and and they would ask her, "Well,
[45:13] I'm sure this son wouldn't mind helping
[45:16] you if he knew that you was in this
[45:18] condition with no food, with no no
[45:20] money. I know he would help you." And
[45:22] she would say, "Well, he is a good boy.
[45:25] He thinks of me. He sends me letters
[45:27] once or twice a month and and they're
[45:29] pretty pictures and and he's so
[45:32] thoughtful to send me these things." And
[45:34] and they would ask her, "Well, let me
[45:36] look up these pictures. What is he
[45:38] sending you?" and and she would say,
[45:40] "Well, they're right over here in my
[45:41] Bible." She would open up her Bible and
[45:43] would take out these pictures and would
[45:45] say, "See these beautiful pictures and
[45:47] they would look at her and say,"Those
[45:49] ain't pictures, ma'am. Those are money
[45:51] orders. You have thousands of dollars
[45:54] that he's been sending you, but yet she
[45:57] was living in poverty." And I think, "Oh
[46:00] my, sometimes we get that way." God has
[46:03] given us the blessings. God has given us
[46:05] the Holy Ghost. He's given us his word
[46:08] in the hour that has given us an
[46:10] authority where the devil don't have to
[46:13] dictate us, where our emotions don't
[46:15] have to dictate us, but we live in
[46:17] spiritual poverty because we fail to
[46:20] realize that God has given us more than
[46:23] quotes, but he's given us an authority
[46:25] in the word of the Lord that has given
[46:28] us a power. And I believe that brother
[46:31] Brandham, he would say this here, and we
[46:33] are men and women. We are also
[46:36] Christians. If he is our example, let us
[46:39] completely deliver ourselves into the
[46:42] hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be
[46:45] subjects of the kingdom of God. And
[46:48] that's where I would get my thought out
[46:49] of it. We have to deliver ourselves into
[46:52] the hands of the Holy Ghost that we
[46:55] might be subjects of the kingdom of God.
[46:58] And I and I love how brother Brandon
[46:59] would put it. We are men and women, but
[47:02] we are also Christians. A and that
[47:05] really shocked me because we we all have
[47:07] mistakes. We all have failures. We all
[47:10] have quirks and we all have flaws. But
[47:12] don't forget, you're also a Christian.
[47:14] You see, too many times we use those
[47:17] things as an excuse. And I know I've
[47:19] been guilty of it. You know, you lose a
[47:21] temper. Well, I'm just human. You know,
[47:23] well, you get you get bitter at somebody
[47:25] and you won't talk to them. Well, I'm
[47:27] just human. You see, Brother Brandham
[47:29] says we're men and women, but we're also
[47:31] Christians. You see, and I believe once
[47:33] you get the Holy Ghost, you you do away
[47:36] with all of your rights. And brother
[47:38] Brandon would tell us that you lose all
[47:39] of your rights. I believe he would say
[47:41] at Calvary, right? So, we have no more
[47:44] excuse once we get the Holy Ghost. But
[47:47] there's something that we have to do.
[47:49] Brother Brandham says we have to
[47:51] completely deliver ourselves. You may
[47:53] say, "How did you deliver yourself?
[47:55] There's no way you can set I can set
[47:57] myself free from smoking, set myself
[48:00] free from drugs and from alcohol. But
[48:02] the way you deliver yourself is giving
[48:05] yourself to the Holy Ghost. And as you
[48:08] deliver yourself to the Holy Ghost, that
[48:11] brings a total deliverance from your
[48:14] flesh. You see, because there's a war
[48:16] inside of you. And the Bible would say
[48:19] in 1 Peter 2:11, "Dearly beloved, I
[48:22] beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
[48:24] abstain from fleshly lusts which war
[48:28] against your soul." And so your flesh is
[48:31] waring against your soul. Your your mind
[48:34] is waring against your soul. Your
[48:36] emotions is waring against your soul.
[48:39] But you have to deliver all of those
[48:41] emotions, all of your thinking, all of
[48:43] your ideas, all of your uh your your
[48:46] your motives and objective. As you
[48:48] deliver that to the Holy Ghost, then
[48:51] there brings then there comes a liberty
[48:54] from the flesh that is trying to to to
[48:57] war against you. And the Bible would
[48:58] tell us in Romans 7 and 21, I find then
[49:02] a law that when I do good, evil is
[49:04] present with me. So the apostle Paul is
[49:07] saying I want to do good and when I do
[49:10] good evil is always with me. What is the
[49:13] evil he's talking about? He would
[49:15] continue on the sec the 22nd verse
[49:18] Romans 7 and 22. For I delight in the
[49:21] law of God after the inward man. And so
[49:25] there's the battle. The inward man is is
[49:28] striving for the kingdom of God,
[49:30] striving for the things of God. But
[49:33] there's evil that is present, which is
[49:35] the flesh. And he says, "But I see
[49:37] another law in my members, waring
[49:40] against the law of my mind, and bringing
[49:43] me into captivity to the law of sin,
[49:46] which is my members." But I I don't
[49:49] believe we have to fall captivity to the
[49:52] members of your flesh, to your mind, to
[49:55] your emotions, your reasoning. But there
[49:57] is a fight on the inside that you can
[50:00] prevail. And how do you prevail in this
[50:03] fight? Brother Brandon would tell us to
[50:05] the black dog and the white dog, right?
[50:07] He would say there was a chief and he
[50:09] would say that a man would ask the
[50:11] chief, "How are you doing today? You
[50:13] just you just been baptized. I believe
[50:15] you you're you're a new Christian now.
[50:18] How are you doing?" He would say,
[50:19] "Sometimes good, sometimes bad." And he
[50:22] would they they would ask him, "Well,
[50:23] what do you mean?" He says, "There's a
[50:25] war on the inside. There's a black dog
[50:27] and a white dog, and they're battling.
[50:29] They're going back and forth and he
[50:31] says, "Well, which one is winning?" He
[50:33] says, "The one I feed the most." You
[50:35] see, and so the one you feed the most,
[50:37] you're either going to feed the flesh or
[50:40] you're going to feed the soul. And how
[50:42] do you feed the flesh? By the pleasures
[50:44] of the world. But by by gossip and by
[50:46] and by bitterness and by this and by
[50:49] that. But how do you feed the soul? By
[50:52] feeding on the word of the Lord. By
[50:54] coming into a prayer closet. But by
[50:56] delivering yourself from your flesh to
[50:59] the hands of the Holy Ghost, then
[51:02] there's a battle that is beginning to be
[51:04] won inside of you. You see, I don't
[51:07] believe that we have to be bound every
[51:09] day of our life, but there's a total
[51:11] deliverance that can take place on the
[51:14] inside of our life. Oh my. That when I
[51:17] do good, evil is present, but I'm not
[51:19] being controlled by the evil. It is
[51:22] always with me. Your flesh is never
[51:24] going to be saved. Your soul is safe,
[51:26] but you're still going to have
[51:28] temptations. You're still going to have
[51:30] mistakes, but your flesh is not
[51:32] controlling you, but your soul is
[51:35] bringing your flesh into subjection. And
[51:38] that's what the Apostle Paul is saying.
[51:40] I bring my body and keep it and bring it
[51:43] into subjection. That when I preach to
[51:45] others, I myself should be a castaway.
[51:48] He's letting you know that you have to
[51:51] bring it into subjection. You've got to
[51:53] feed the right thing. And you will look
[51:56] at Jesus and even Jesus had to deliver
[51:59] himself. You look there there in Luke 24
[52:02] and 7, the Bible would say that he would
[52:05] deliver himself into the hands of sinful
[52:08] men and be crucified and the third day
[52:12] rise again. So in order for there to be
[52:15] a victory, there had to be him
[52:17] delivering himself. Oh, come on. When
[52:20] you want victory over things, you have
[52:22] to deliver yourself. In order to deliver
[52:24] yourself, you have to give up. The word
[52:26] deliver means to give up to give over.
[52:29] And the Bible would tell us that Jesus,
[52:31] he was led a sh sheep to the slaughter,
[52:34] a lamb dumb before its sheer. So he
[52:37] opened not his mouth. He could have, and
[52:40] brother Brano would tell us that when he
[52:42] was upon the cross, all he had to do was
[52:45] move his hands a little bit. And there
[52:46] was legions of angels that would come
[52:48] and pluck him off of that cross. But you
[52:51] would see that he would deliver himself.
[52:54] And by him delivering himself would
[52:57] bring a total deliverance. Oh, and I
[53:00] believe as we deliver oursel, it brings
[53:02] a total deliverance in every one of our
[53:05] life. And you would say that, well, he
[53:07] was all God. He did not have to
[53:09] surrender his flesh. But why was he in
[53:12] the garden of Gethsemane agonizing? The
[53:14] Bible says he would come three times,
[53:16] right? He would say, "If it's possible,
[53:17] let this cup pass from me." He would get
[53:19] up and come back again. If it's
[53:21] possible, let this cup pass from me. But
[53:24] the third time, he would agonize until
[53:27] his sweat become drops of blood. Then he
[53:30] would deliver himself and would say,
[53:32] "But not my will, but thy will be done."
[53:36] Sometimes it takes some agonizing. It
[53:38] takes some some some some praying and
[53:40] pressing and saying, "Lord, if it's
[53:43] possible, let it pass from me, but
[53:45] nevertheless, not my will, but I'm
[53:48] delivering myself to the hands of the
[53:50] Holy Ghost that there can be a total
[53:53] deliverance in my life." Oh, I want to
[53:56] be subject to the kingdom of God. Oh my.
[53:59] The Bible would tell us that Jesus was
[54:02] tempted in every like manner like we
[54:03] are, yet without sin. Brother Brandon
[54:06] would tell us he had mind battles. He
[54:08] had he had headaches. He had he was
[54:10] tempted with women. He he he wanted to
[54:13] have a family. But yet he would deliver
[54:16] himself to the purpose of almighty God.
[54:19] And I say, let us completely deliver
[54:22] oursel into all the hands of almighty
[54:24] God so that we can fulfill the purpose
[54:27] that God has for us. And and and and
[54:30] brother Brandon would preach a message
[54:32] called uh the teaching of on Moses. And
[54:35] he and and it's a children's message,
[54:37] but but but he would he would read the
[54:39] scripture about if you if you keep your
[54:42] soul, you're going to lose it. But if
[54:44] you lose your soul for my sake, you're
[54:46] going to find it. And he would tell us,
[54:48] you have to give it up in order to
[54:50] receive it again. He he would talk about
[54:53] Jockabed and Amran and how that that the
[54:56] the the devil was was bringing a
[54:58] persecution and how that the the enemy
[55:01] would come and knock on their door. And
[55:04] and I think it's incredible because the
[55:06] brother Brandham would tell us that it
[55:07] was some old witches with w with with
[55:09] with long nose that that didn't want to
[55:12] have any babies. But then he said that
[55:14] that now they were coming after the
[55:15] children of the Israelites and they
[55:17] would bang on the door and would say,
[55:19] "Hey, we know there's a baby in there."
[55:22] And and and and brother Brandon would
[55:24] say that that Amran had a secret place
[55:27] that Moses was in. And as the the the
[55:29] those witches would come into the home,
[55:32] they would turn over the furniture, turn
[55:34] over the table, but never could find the
[55:36] secret place. You see, in order for them
[55:39] to keep it, they had to hide it. They
[55:41] had to give it away. And brother
[55:43] Brandham then in that in that message,
[55:45] he would say that that the that the
[55:47] jockabed and Amran would would build an
[55:49] ark and and and Moses' dad would come up
[55:52] to his mother and would say, "I know
[55:54] what we have to do. We have to give it
[55:56] up." And she would say, "No, you're
[55:59] crazy. You're just as you're just as
[56:01] crazy as Pharaoh is." You know, and and
[56:04] and the daddy would say, "No, in order
[56:06] for us to keep it, we have to give it
[56:08] up." So they would put it into the into
[56:11] the the the Nile River, I believe. And
[56:13] when they gave it up, but the Brandom
[56:15] says something was going on in heaven.
[56:18] He would send angels to keep the
[56:20] crocodiles away from him. And it's
[56:22] incredible because uh brother Brandon
[56:24] would say that one of the angels would
[56:25] ask God, "What are you going to do?" He
[56:28] says, "Well, I'm going to be at the
[56:29] receiving end of it." You see, when they
[56:32] give it up, I'm going to be at the end
[56:34] waiting on him. And brother Brandham
[56:36] would tell us, in order to get it back,
[56:38] you have to give it up. You see, in
[56:40] order to be delivered, you have to
[56:42] deliver yourself into the hands of the
[56:45] Holy Ghost. And you see, brother Brandon
[56:47] would say this here, uh uh uh when you
[56:50] when you when yourself is completely and
[56:52] totally brought under the blood, there
[56:55] be a total deliverance. There be a
[56:57] freedom like you've never known before.
[57:00] When everything's brought under the
[57:01] blood, brought in submission to the
[57:04] kingdom of God. Then there be a real
[57:07] deliverance. How many wants a real
[57:09] deliverance this morning? maybe a real
[57:11] deliverance from from from mind battles
[57:13] or or a real deliverance from from aches
[57:15] and pains and sicknesses in your body or
[57:18] just right a total deliverance for a
[57:20] body change. But in order for that to
[57:22] happen, we have to deliver oursel and
[57:25] brother Brandham he or but Jesus would
[57:27] experience this total deliverance. And
[57:29] brother Brandham would say he was
[57:31] totally man. He was totally God. But he
[57:35] surrendered his natural parts, his
[57:38] physical parts, his own thinking, his
[57:40] own doing, and his own cares. And I do
[57:43] only that which pleases the father.
[57:46] There you are totally delivered from
[57:49] human beings. I thought that was so
[57:52] powerful that he was completely man,
[57:54] completely God. But as he would
[57:56] surrender himself, he would be delivered
[57:59] from the flesh and he would do only what
[58:02] the will of God was. And that is
[58:05] something that we can put in our heart
[58:06] that as we surrender ourselves,
[58:08] surrender our thinking, surrender our
[58:10] own doing, surrender our own our own
[58:12] cares, our own thoughts, we're being
[58:15] completely delivered from this human
[58:17] flesh. Do we still have mind balance?
[58:20] Yes, we have mind battles. Do we still
[58:21] have mistakes and failures? Yes, we
[58:24] still have those things. But we're not
[58:26] captive to the flesh, but we're subject
[58:29] to the kingdom of God. And I believe
[58:32] we're subjects. God has called us to be
[58:35] be subjects to his kingdom. And the
[58:37] Bible would tell us that I die daily.
[58:40] It's a daily dying. It's a daily
[58:42] delivering yourself up. The Bible would
[58:44] say take up your cross daily. You see,
[58:47] it is not something that you do just one
[58:49] time. You give your give your heart to
[58:51] the Lord and then you're good for the
[58:53] rest of your life. It's a daily
[58:55] delivering up. It's a daily
[58:57] surrendering, a daily dying. And as you
[59:00] daily die, you're growing. Every day you
[59:03] grow a little higher, you grow a little
[59:05] higher. As you feed on the word, feed on
[59:07] the message, you're growing into the
[59:10] stature of a perfect man. But you have
[59:12] to deliver yourself. Oh, hallelujah. And
[59:17] I bring my body into subjection. And the
[59:20] Scoffield Bible would say that you have
[59:22] to lead your body captive. And I love
[59:25] that he would take that word subjection
[59:27] and would say lead your body captive. So
[59:30] I bring my body and lead it captive. So
[59:33] now it's not your fa your flesh leading
[59:35] you captive or your your emotions or
[59:38] your self-will, your desires leading you
[59:40] captive, but now it's the word leading
[59:43] you captive. I'm bringing my body under
[59:46] subjection. If not, we'll be a cast
[59:48] away. And the word in the Greek means
[59:51] not standing the test. And oh my, the
[59:54] devil's testing us. And brother Brown
[59:57] would tell us to be tempted is to be
[59:59] tested. And so when the devil's coming
[1:00:01] and he's tempting you and he's he he's
[1:00:04] trying to cause you to fall and make
[1:00:06] mistakes, what he's doing, he's trying
[1:00:08] to get you to be a cast away. But if God
[1:00:12] started a work in your life, he's going
[1:00:14] to be faithful to complete thy work. Oh,
[1:00:18] do you believe that this morning that if
[1:00:20] God has started something in my life, if
[1:00:22] I die to myself daily, I'm not going to
[1:00:25] be a cast away, but I'm going to receive
[1:00:28] the crown of life. And the Bible would
[1:00:30] tell us in James 1:12, "Blessed is the
[1:00:33] man that endureth temptation, for when
[1:00:36] he is tried or tested, he shall receive
[1:00:39] the crown of life." And the apostle Paul
[1:00:42] would tell us the brother Brandham would
[1:00:45] tell us rather what is the crown of
[1:00:47] life? He would say it is eternal life.
[1:00:50] And when you receive that crown, he says
[1:00:52] you receive a dominion. Oh my. He says
[1:00:55] this here, the the 11th verse. All
[1:00:57] right. A crown of life. The 11th verse
[1:00:59] says, "Behold, I come quickly. What
[1:01:01] quickly after this now see? Behold, I
[1:01:03] hope hold fast to that which thou hast."
[1:01:06] What is a crown? What is a crown? A
[1:01:09] crown means you have a domain. You're a
[1:01:12] king if you're crowned. See? And we are
[1:01:14] sons of God. We were when we're crowned
[1:01:17] with eternal life. And our domain is on
[1:01:20] the earth. Make you kings and priests
[1:01:22] under God. Is that right? So there you
[1:01:25] are. So when you're standing the test or
[1:01:29] standing the temptation by by by
[1:01:31] bringing your body into into subjection,
[1:01:34] you're receiving a crown of eternal
[1:01:36] life. And when you receive that eternal,
[1:01:39] and I believe we have that eternal life
[1:01:41] right now, you believe that this morning
[1:01:43] that once you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:46] we're not waiting for eternal life, but
[1:01:48] eternal life is living in you right now.
[1:01:50] It's the it's the earnest of our
[1:01:52] resurrection, right? It's the earnest.
[1:01:54] We we we've got something right now that
[1:01:56] proves that we've got something waiting
[1:01:58] on us. And brother Brandham is telling
[1:02:00] telling us here that when we re receive
[1:02:03] the crown of life, there's a dominion
[1:02:06] that we are placed into. And the Bible
[1:02:09] would tell us in Luke 1:33, "And his
[1:02:12] kingdom shall there be no end." So once
[1:02:15] we're placed into a kingdom, it's not a
[1:02:17] kingdom that's here today and gone
[1:02:20] tomorrow. And we can look throughout the
[1:02:22] the world history. The Greeks, the
[1:02:24] Persians, the Romans, the Egyptians,
[1:02:26] they all had kingdoms. But now the
[1:02:29] Brandon would tell us, you have to dig
[1:02:31] under dig into the earth just to find
[1:02:33] them. You got to dig up from the palace,
[1:02:35] the throne. You got to dig because the
[1:02:38] the the natural kingdoms have no
[1:02:40] stability to stand for eternity. that
[1:02:43] may have stood for some time, but all
[1:02:46] good things have to come to an end. But
[1:02:48] the Bible is saying that this kingdom,
[1:02:50] not an earthly kingdom, but a heavenly
[1:02:53] kingdom, there shall be no end. So when
[1:02:57] we're placed into this kingdom, it's not
[1:02:59] just for today or for tomorrow, but it's
[1:03:02] for all of eternity. That's why I
[1:03:04] believe that when God starts something
[1:03:06] in your life, he's going to be faithful
[1:03:09] to complete it. If you're born into the
[1:03:12] kingdom, the devil can come with your
[1:03:14] past. He can come with condemnation. He
[1:03:16] can come with your falls and your and
[1:03:18] your mistakes. But if you're baptized
[1:03:20] into the kingdom, there's nothing the
[1:03:22] devil can do to bring you back out of
[1:03:24] it. Oh, we're sealed into the day of our
[1:03:27] redemption. You believe that this
[1:03:29] morning? We're sealed. And brother
[1:03:31] Brandon would say, "How do you get into
[1:03:33] this body?" By one spirit. We're all
[1:03:35] baptized into one body. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:39] were we're many members but there's one
[1:03:41] body which is Jesus Christ and brother
[1:03:44] Brown would say this here but the hour
[1:03:46] is come that every kingdom has to give
[1:03:49] away because there's a kingdom of God
[1:03:52] that's established in the human heart by
[1:03:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:03:58] presence of Jesus Christ and Christ will
[1:04:01] come to his bride and will set up a
[1:04:04] kingdom here on earth that will never be
[1:04:07] diminished. How do you get into this
[1:04:09] kingdom? You're born into it. How do you
[1:04:12] know it? H how would you belong into a
[1:04:14] kingdom and disagree with the king? He
[1:04:17] says the king is the word. In the
[1:04:19] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:04:21] with God and the word was God. It say so
[1:04:24] once we're placed into the kingdom, the
[1:04:27] king is the word. So whenever the word
[1:04:30] says something, we bring our body leaded
[1:04:33] captive to the word of God. Oh, you're
[1:04:37] not hearing me now. You see, we have our
[1:04:39] struggles. We have our temptations. But
[1:04:41] our king, the word, if it says that to
[1:04:44] turn your head from a woman that's
[1:04:46] walking down the road, we lead our body
[1:04:48] captive. When it says that to to root up
[1:04:51] the root of bitterness, we lead our body
[1:04:54] captive. If it says to cast down
[1:04:56] reasoning and emotions and every high
[1:04:58] thing that exaltth itself above the name
[1:05:00] of God, we bring our body captive. Is it
[1:05:03] a fight? Yes, it's a fight, but there's
[1:05:06] an authority that can prevail in every
[1:05:09] one of our lives when we bring our body
[1:05:11] captive and bring it into subjection.
[1:05:15] Oh, and I believe that is a reality.
[1:05:17] That ain't just something we talk about.
[1:05:19] But I believe, brother Brown, I'm going
[1:05:20] tell us that a man can live so close to
[1:05:22] God that the devil don't know what to do
[1:05:24] with him. What is it? Somebody that is
[1:05:27] leading their body captive, bringing
[1:05:29] their emotions into subjection. Oh,
[1:05:32] hallelujah. And brother Brandon would
[1:05:34] say he would talk about the Ty of Babel
[1:05:37] and would say it was their motive to
[1:05:39] build a man made earthly dominion and
[1:05:42] that only got him so far. It got him off
[1:05:44] the ground a little bit, but it never
[1:05:46] took him into the heavenlies. And he
[1:05:48] says God don't want that. He says he
[1:05:51] don't want you under Methodist or
[1:05:53] Baptist or or or a church head united
[1:05:55] under Rome. He don't want you under a
[1:05:58] church dominion. He wants you under his
[1:06:00] spiritual dominion, the Holy Ghost. And
[1:06:03] when the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:05] comes, the world becomes dead. And
[1:06:08] you're filled with the baptism of the
[1:06:10] Holy Ghost. And that the devil is a
[1:06:12] person that has to stay away from you.
[1:06:15] You're under God's domain. You're a new
[1:06:17] creation, a new creature. The Holy
[1:06:19] Spirit can come into that empty place
[1:06:23] and fill it up. So in order for the Holy
[1:06:26] Ghost to fill up that empty place, there
[1:06:29] has to be an empty place. Right? So in
[1:06:31] order for there to be an empty place,
[1:06:33] you have to deliver yourself. And it's
[1:06:35] incredible because brother Brandham says
[1:06:37] the devil is a person, a real person,
[1:06:39] right? He's a real being. And brother
[1:06:40] Brandham would tell us in order to
[1:06:42] overcome, you have to recognize the
[1:06:44] devil that he is real, right? But then
[1:06:47] you have to recognize that he's against
[1:06:49] you. You see, too many times we fail to
[1:06:52] realize that the devil's against us,
[1:06:54] that emotions are against us, that hard
[1:06:56] feelings are against us, the complexes
[1:06:59] are against us, that that the the
[1:07:01] temptations are against us. Because if
[1:07:03] you never realize they're against you,
[1:07:06] you're never going to deliver them up.
[1:07:07] But Brandham says, you got to realize
[1:07:09] there's a real devil that he's against
[1:07:11] you. Then remember that the God that is
[1:07:14] in you is greater than the devil that's
[1:07:18] against you. So once you realize there's
[1:07:20] a real person that is after you, then
[1:07:23] you got to also remember the greater is
[1:07:26] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:07:29] world. That there is an authority that
[1:07:32] can deliver your flesh to the hands of
[1:07:35] the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then you're under God's
[1:07:39] domain. I want to be under God's domain.
[1:07:41] I don't want to be under man's domain.
[1:07:43] Man, man has went up and has went down,
[1:07:45] up and down. But the word will endure
[1:07:48] forever. And it's incredible. And I
[1:07:49] think it's in in first Peter. I was
[1:07:52] doing a a little study the other day and
[1:07:54] I came across this scripture in the
[1:07:56] Bible. I think it's first Peter uh one
[1:07:58] maybe. And Peter would say that that the
[1:08:00] flesh is like grass and it's like it's
[1:08:03] like the flower that wither away, but
[1:08:06] the word of God is eternal. It's
[1:08:08] everlasting. And then he would say this,
[1:08:10] and this is the gospel which I preach
[1:08:14] unto you. He he didn't say there there's
[1:08:17] an eternal word here and I'm preaching
[1:08:19] something different to you. But the
[1:08:21] eternal word is what I am bringing to
[1:08:24] you. And our flesh withers the way it's
[1:08:27] like a flower. We're up today gone
[1:08:29] tomorrow. We got gray hair, losing our
[1:08:31] hair, losing our muscle, losing our
[1:08:33] memory. But the word of God is
[1:08:35] everlasting. And this is the message
[1:08:38] that has been brought unto us.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. that we maybe when we
[1:08:44] lose our energy, we we lose our
[1:08:46] strength. Whenever our mind starts to
[1:08:48] slip a little bit, the word of God is
[1:08:51] still yay and amen, it has the final say
[1:08:54] over everything that we go through. But
[1:08:56] it's a spiritual kingdom that we are
[1:08:59] placed into. And you and the Bible would
[1:09:02] tell us in Luke 16 and 16, the law and
[1:09:05] the prophets were unto John. Since that
[1:09:08] time, the kingdom of God is preached and
[1:09:11] every man presseth into it. So, it's a
[1:09:14] fight to get into the kingdom of God.
[1:09:17] You say, is it a is it a physical fight?
[1:09:19] It's a spiritual fight. Every man
[1:09:21] presseth into it. And the Bible would
[1:09:24] tell us that the kingdom of heaven,
[1:09:26] Matthew 11:12, and from the days of John
[1:09:29] the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
[1:09:32] heaven suffereth violence, and the vi
[1:09:34] the violent take it by force. And so
[1:09:37] sometimes we got to get dirty. Sometimes
[1:09:39] it takes some fight and some tears and
[1:09:41] some blood and some sweat, but we're
[1:09:43] taking the kingdom by force. And brother
[1:09:46] Brandon would say, God's kingdom is not
[1:09:48] of this earth. God's kingdom is in our
[1:09:50] hearts. It's the spiritual kingdom that
[1:09:53] we're born into. And Jesus said, "The
[1:09:56] kingdom of God comes, but not without
[1:09:58] violence. And the kingdom of God is
[1:10:00] within you. the Holy Spirit, God's
[1:10:03] kingdom, moving in the man and governing
[1:10:06] and controlling him. That's the kingdom.
[1:10:09] So, what is the the the taking the
[1:10:12] kingdom by violence and taking it by
[1:10:13] force? It's the Holy Ghost governing and
[1:10:16] controlling you. It's not going to
[1:10:18] happen easy, but it's going to take a
[1:10:20] fight. As you're surrendering your will
[1:10:23] to the hands of God, you're taking the
[1:10:25] kingdom. Oh, and I believe that's what
[1:10:27] God wants on the earth today is a
[1:10:29] dominion. is a kingdom in the hearts of
[1:10:32] every one of his believers. That we're
[1:10:34] not just sayers or but but we're doers.
[1:10:36] You know, we're not just from our lips
[1:10:38] speaking the things of God. And our
[1:10:40] heart is far from him, but our heart is
[1:10:43] in tune with the word of God. And he
[1:10:46] governs and controls my actions,
[1:10:48] controls my thoughts, controls what I
[1:10:50] say and what I do. It's a kingdom that
[1:10:53] is upon the earth today. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:56] And brother Brown would talk about Moses
[1:10:59] and would say he was completely
[1:11:00] surrendered
[1:11:02] to the hands of God till God could trust
[1:11:05] him.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? That it wasn't
[1:11:08] Moses trusting God, but God was trusting
[1:11:10] Moses. That's why whenever Moses was at
[1:11:14] the Red Sea and he was crying under God
[1:11:16] and God would say, "Why cry unto me?
[1:11:18] Speak and go forward." He had so
[1:11:21] surrendered himself to God that God
[1:11:24] trusted him with the authority of the
[1:11:27] kingdom that you can speak the word and
[1:11:30] there's no red sea that can stand in
[1:11:32] front of you. Oh, how it was Joshua that
[1:11:35] he was commissioned to destroy the enemy
[1:11:38] and as he was in the middle of the
[1:11:39] fight, the sun started to go down,
[1:11:42] right? And the Bible says he commanded
[1:11:43] the son to stand still. He had go he had
[1:11:47] God's trust and the authority was given
[1:11:50] to him. Oh, brother Brown was saying
[1:11:52] that he didn't have to pray about it,
[1:11:54] ask about it. He was tied to an
[1:11:56] absolute. He was tied to the word of God
[1:11:59] with the commission and he spoke the
[1:12:02] word. He was entrusted by God with the
[1:12:05] authority of the kingdom. And I say we
[1:12:08] can be so submissive to the word of God
[1:12:11] that he trusts us with the word of God
[1:12:14] that you can speak to the mountain. You
[1:12:16] can speak to your circumstances. The
[1:12:18] Bible would say, "For it is your
[1:12:19] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:12:22] kingdom." And the word good pleasure is
[1:12:24] good will. So it's the will of the
[1:12:26] father to entrust you with the kingdom.
[1:12:30] But first, you have to be subdued by the
[1:12:33] hand of the Holy Ghost. Oh hallelujah.
[1:12:37] Then he trusts us with the authority of
[1:12:40] the kingdom that whatever you bind on
[1:12:42] earth will be bound in heaven. Right?
[1:12:44] Whatever you loose will be loosed in
[1:12:47] heaven. It's God trusting his people
[1:12:50] with the kingdom. And the Bible would
[1:12:52] say he's made us kings and priests. And
[1:12:55] brother Brandham would say this is
[1:12:56] happening right now. He says there is a
[1:12:59] kingdom to come but we're reigning right
[1:13:01] now in the spiritual kingdom of God. He
[1:13:04] would say, "And he hath made us." Oh,
[1:13:07] there was no certain truths. We need to
[1:13:09] emphasize this is one of them. He He
[1:13:12] hath made us. Salvation is his doing.
[1:13:15] Salvation is of the Lord. All of grace.
[1:13:18] He redeemed us for a purpose. He bought
[1:13:22] us for a purpose. I love that because
[1:13:25] brother Brown, he's putting it that it's
[1:13:27] not what you done, it's what he done.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests. It
[1:13:33] was the grace of God. The emphasis is on
[1:13:36] he and I love this scripture here in 1
[1:13:39] Peter 2:9. But you are a chosen
[1:13:42] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:13:45] nation, a peculiar people, that you
[1:13:47] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:13:50] hath called you out of darkness into his
[1:13:54] marvelous light. The next verse, which
[1:13:56] in times past were not a people, but now
[1:14:00] the people of God, which had not
[1:14:02] obtained mercy, but now have obtained
[1:14:06] mercy. You once was a nobody. You was a
[1:14:09] cast away. You're you're on your way to
[1:14:11] hell, but now by the grace of God, he
[1:14:14] chose you and established his kingdom on
[1:14:17] the inside of your heart.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; We once was without mercy, but now we
[1:14:22] have mercy. We was without grace, but
[1:14:25] now we have grace. We was without hope,
[1:14:28] but now we have hope. How, brother Josh,
[1:14:30] the emphasis is on he. He hath made us
[1:14:35] worthy. He hath made us kings and
[1:14:37] priests. He hath chosen us to be a royal
[1:14:40] priesthood, a holy nation. And he hath
[1:14:43] called us out of darkness into marvelous
[1:14:46] light. We once were a people of
[1:14:48] darkness, but now we're a people of
[1:14:50] light. Now Jesus would tell us, "Let
[1:14:52] your light shine. Let don't put it under
[1:14:54] a bushel, but let your light shine." In
[1:14:57] other words, you're not a people of
[1:14:59] darkness any longer. You're a people of
[1:15:01] the light. Let the kingdom flow through
[1:15:04] you. You're not subjects of an earthly
[1:15:07] dominion. You're a subject of a heavenly
[1:15:09] dominion that is inside of the heart of
[1:15:12] the believer. Yes, sir.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Let your light shine. Don't put it in a
[1:15:17] corner somewhere. Let your light shine.
[1:15:20] Hallelujah. It was by the grace of God
[1:15:22] that he would call you. Brother Brandham
[1:15:24] would say we are kings, spiritual kings.
[1:15:27] Oh, we are we are we are going to be
[1:15:29] kings upon the earth when he sets when
[1:15:32] he sets his when he sets on his throne.
[1:15:34] But now we are spiritual kings and reign
[1:15:37] over a spiritual de a spiritual kingdom.
[1:15:41] Then he tells us what are we reigning
[1:15:43] over? Because we hear that a lot that
[1:15:46] we're kings. We have a dominion. But
[1:15:48] what are we reigning over? Brother say
[1:15:50] right now we reign with Christ having
[1:15:53] dominion over sin, the world, the flesh,
[1:15:58] and the devil. So where is your dominion
[1:16:01] in your flesh over your flesh? Oh, come
[1:16:05] on now. You might not be speaking like
[1:16:08] you might not be speaking and causing
[1:16:10] the sun to stand still. You might not be
[1:16:13] splitting the Red Sea. You might not be
[1:16:15] like David and bringing down a natural
[1:16:17] giant, but your dominion is a spiritual
[1:16:20] dominion over the spirits that try to
[1:16:23] plague your flesh.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's a kingdom inside of
[1:16:29] your flesh. And the Bible would tell us
[1:16:30] Colossians 1:13, who hath delivered us
[1:16:33] from the power of darkness and have
[1:16:36] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:16:40] dear son. And so darkness is still here,
[1:16:43] but there's no power of that darkness.
[1:16:46] You're still in your flesh, but there's
[1:16:49] no power for on your flesh that is
[1:16:51] bringing you into subjection. Your flesh
[1:16:54] is still there, but there's no power
[1:16:56] over you. Hallelujah. And it translated
[1:17:00] us into the kingdom of his dear son. And
[1:17:03] the word translation or translated means
[1:17:06] to be brought from one place to another.
[1:17:08] So from one one position of bound by
[1:17:11] flesh to another one where that flesh
[1:17:14] has no power over it. You see we're no
[1:17:17] longer dictated. And that's why my my my
[1:17:19] my opening quote brother Brandham was
[1:17:21] telling us that there we don't have to
[1:17:23] be dictated by sin. We don't have to be
[1:17:25] dictated by our flesh. We don't have to
[1:17:27] fall subject to the things of the world
[1:17:30] because we've been translated brought
[1:17:32] from one dominion to another. We're once
[1:17:35] a part of the dominion of sin, but now
[1:17:37] we're a part of the dominion of the
[1:17:40] kingdom of heaven.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we're walking in Leoa,
[1:17:44] but we're delivered from the power of
[1:17:47] Leoa. We're walking amongst gross
[1:17:50] darkness, but we've been delivered from
[1:17:52] the power of gross darkness. And the
[1:17:54] Bible would tell us that the devils are
[1:17:56] the the Satan's like a roaring lion
[1:17:59] seeking whom he may devour. He's still
[1:18:02] here, but he has no power over you,
[1:18:04] right? He's powerless over you. So, so
[1:18:08] the flesh can rise up and temptations
[1:18:10] can rise up, but if you've been
[1:18:12] translated from one kingdom to another,
[1:18:15] temptations are there, but there's no
[1:18:17] power over you. And say, I don't want
[1:18:20] the devil having any power over me. no
[1:18:22] jurisdiction over my mind, over my
[1:18:24] family, over my home, over my church,
[1:18:26] but I want to be delivered into the
[1:18:29] hands of the Holy Ghost where the the
[1:18:31] where the devil loses all of his power
[1:18:33] over me.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, we've been placed,
[1:18:37] we've been translated from one place to
[1:18:39] another. And you remember John, he he
[1:18:41] was he he was on the aisle of Patmas and
[1:18:44] was say, I was in the spirit on the
[1:18:46] Lord's day. Brother Brandon would say he
[1:18:47] got into the spirit and was translated
[1:18:50] into the Lord's day or was moved from
[1:18:52] one place to another. And it's
[1:18:55] incredible because if you look his flesh
[1:18:58] was still on the aisle of Patmas, right?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; He was still being tormented. He was
[1:19:03] still having the most miserable time,
[1:19:06] but his spirit man was moved from one
[1:19:09] place to another. And it's incredible
[1:19:12] because the Bible would tell us that
[1:19:13] John was weeping because there was no
[1:19:16] man found worthy to open the book to
[1:19:18] loosen the seals, not even to look upon
[1:19:20] the book. But then he heard of one of
[1:19:22] the elders, right, that would say, "Weep
[1:19:24] not, John, for the lion of the tribe of
[1:19:27] Judah hath prevailed to take the book
[1:19:29] and loosen the seals." And then he went
[1:19:32] from weeping to rejoicing. How come?
[1:19:35] Because when that book came open, he
[1:19:37] realized I'm a part of the kingdom. That
[1:19:40] my flesh is still on the aisle of
[1:19:43] Patmas. Our flesh is still in Leardia.
[1:19:46] But we have been brought into a proud
[1:19:48] age. We've been brought into another
[1:19:50] dominion. Oh, that even when our flesh
[1:19:53] is weak and it's tired, we are part of
[1:19:56] another kingdom. And could you imagine
[1:19:58] that that that John is there on the
[1:20:00] aisle of Patmas, you know, and the Bible
[1:20:02] says that that when he was in the spirit
[1:20:04] on the Lord's day, he heard a voice
[1:20:06] saying, "I'm the alpha and the omega,
[1:20:08] the beginning, and the end." You know,
[1:20:11] and here he is. He's sitting on the
[1:20:13] aisle of Patmas. And I'm sure he would
[1:20:14] have the mind battles. God, have you
[1:20:16] forsaken me? Have you forgot about me?
[1:20:19] I've stood for your name. I've stood for
[1:20:21] the cause of Christ. I've stood and here
[1:20:24] I am on the aisle of Patmas. But then he
[1:20:27] would be translated and there would be
[1:20:29] some encouraging words saying, "Hey, I'm
[1:20:31] the alpha and the omega. I know where
[1:20:34] you are at. You might not understand how
[1:20:37] you're going to get out of it, but I'm
[1:20:39] with you every step of the way." And
[1:20:41] it's encouraging, canon, whenever our
[1:20:44] flesh is weak. Whenever we have mind
[1:20:46] battles, we have aches and we have pains
[1:20:47] and the devil's coming against us. But
[1:20:50] then we can remember we're of another
[1:20:52] kingdom. We're of another domain. And
[1:20:54] our king is never going to leave us.
[1:20:56] He's never going to forsake us. You
[1:20:58] know, brother Brandon would say that
[1:20:59] he's a shepherd. There's a difference
[1:21:01] between a shepherd and a herdsman,
[1:21:02] right? He says the herdsman is with you
[1:21:05] during the day, but then leaves you at
[1:21:07] night and he goes and sleeps in his
[1:21:09] house. But he says the shepherd, he's
[1:21:11] with you during the day, but then at
[1:21:13] night he sleeps with you. And what would
[1:21:15] Christ say? I'm the good shepherd. I'm
[1:21:17] the door of the sheep. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:21] So in the dark times of your life,
[1:21:23] nothing can get to you unless it comes
[1:21:26] through Christ. Oh, that means he can't
[1:21:29] put nothing on you more than you can
[1:21:31] bear. So you might be at your midnight
[1:21:33] hour. You might feel like you're Paul
[1:21:35] and Silas. You're in your prison cell,
[1:21:38] but don't worry, he's not a herdsman.
[1:21:40] He's still with you. He's the good
[1:21:43] shepherd that is with you at the
[1:21:45] midnight hour.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I'm the good shepherd. He would say that
[1:21:49] I know my sheep and my she my sheep know
[1:21:52] me. He's not going to lose the one. He
[1:21:54] would say that all that my father hath
[1:21:55] given me, you know, I won't lose a one.
[1:21:59] So if you're a part of this kingdom, if
[1:22:01] you're a part of his fold, you're never
[1:22:04] going to be lost.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, you see, there's a
[1:22:08] predestinated scene. Patrick Bosow,
[1:22:11] y'all just got baptized this last
[1:22:13] Wednesday. Y'all were always a son of
[1:22:15] God. Even when you was out doing your
[1:22:17] own thing, you was always a son of God.
[1:22:20] You was always a part of it. And the and
[1:22:22] the shepherd was always with you. That's
[1:22:24] why you're here today. That's why all of
[1:22:26] us is here today. Whenever we was
[1:22:28] running from the grace of God, the
[1:22:30] shepherd was still with us calling on
[1:22:33] us. No man cometh unto me unless the
[1:22:36] father first draws him. So there's
[1:22:38] something on the inside that pulls us.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon was saying
[1:22:42] St. Paul said, "My flesh wants to always
[1:22:45] yield to that." Your flesh does too. But
[1:22:47] the law of the spirit of God in the
[1:22:50] heart overcomes the flesh and makes the
[1:22:53] body obey what the heart says do. So
[1:22:57] your flesh is still fighting against
[1:23:00] you. But the law of the spirit of God,
[1:23:03] the kingdom that is in the heart brings
[1:23:05] your body under subjection, brings your
[1:23:08] flesh. And it's incredible because
[1:23:10] brother Brandham must say it's the same
[1:23:11] thing with sickness. He says if you need
[1:23:14] s if you need healing in your body, he
[1:23:16] would say then stand with that power. He
[1:23:18] says the spirit of God in your heart. He
[1:23:21] says points to the word of God by his
[1:23:23] stripes we were healed. And they stand
[1:23:26] with the power to make the sickness in
[1:23:29] that body obey them. Ain't that
[1:23:32] powerful? That the kingdom in your heart
[1:23:35] makes the sickness in your body. Obey
[1:23:37] the word of God. That's why temptations
[1:23:40] they come up but the kingdom in the
[1:23:42] heart brings that under subjection. You
[1:23:45] see and the Bible would tell us that in
[1:23:47] Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the
[1:23:49] father which has made us to meet have
[1:23:52] made us meat to be partakers of the
[1:23:55] inheritance of the saints in the light.
[1:23:58] So in other words this kingdom have this
[1:24:01] kingdom has benefits. By his stripes I
[1:24:04] am healed. He was bruised for my
[1:24:06] iniquities. You see? So this kingdom has
[1:24:09] a heritage that we've been placed into.
[1:24:12] You see, this heritage is for you to
[1:24:14] grab a hold of and manifest through your
[1:24:17] life. You see, and the Bible would tell
[1:24:19] us in Isaiah 54:17, "No weapon that is
[1:24:23] formed against thee shall prosper, and
[1:24:26] every tongue that shall rise against
[1:24:28] thee in the judgment, thou shalt
[1:24:30] condemn." This is the heritage of the
[1:24:33] servants of the Lord. In other words,
[1:24:36] and you look at the word heritage, the
[1:24:38] that word heritage is the property that
[1:24:41] descends to an heir. So once you're
[1:24:43] placed into a kingdom, you're heir of
[1:24:46] all salvation. You're heir to the
[1:24:48] blessings of God. And here Isaiah is
[1:24:51] saying, "No weapon that is formed
[1:24:53] against thee shall prosper." This is
[1:24:56] your heritage. This is your This is your
[1:24:59] property that has been given to you
[1:25:02] because you're descendants of this
[1:25:04] kingdom. Oh, and I believe there's so
[1:25:06] many other promises that we can grab a
[1:25:08] hold of and say, "This is my heritage.
[1:25:11] Healing is my is my heritage.
[1:25:13] Deliverance, the Holy Ghost, salvation
[1:25:16] for my children, the rapture, the body
[1:25:18] change, the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:25:20] is everything that God has given me. I'm
[1:25:23] going to obtain."
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In times past, we wasn't a
[1:25:28] people, but now we are the people of God
[1:25:31] with a heritage. Hallelujah. I believe
[1:25:34] we have a heritage that God has given
[1:25:37] us. And brother Brandham, he he would
[1:25:38] type Jo's prophecy. If I will restore,
[1:25:42] sayeth the Lord, he would say, that's
[1:25:43] the heritage of the Lord. Oh my soul,
[1:25:46] this message is your heritage.
[1:25:48] Everything that was lost to the church
[1:25:50] ages, I will restore. That's why the
[1:25:53] angel told John, you know, go to the
[1:25:55] angel with the open book in hand and
[1:25:57] tell him, "Give me the book." And as you
[1:26:00] get the book, get the book, partake of
[1:26:02] the book. What was it? That was John's
[1:26:04] heritage. And in order for him to
[1:26:06] partake of that heritage, he had to go
[1:26:09] and get it out of the angel's hand. And
[1:26:11] if there's ever a time to get into these
[1:26:13] tapes, it is now. Oh, come on now. If
[1:26:16] there's ever a time to get into the word
[1:26:18] of God for yourself, it is now. It is
[1:26:20] your heritage. It is the the inheritance
[1:26:24] that God has given you. Oh my. It's a
[1:26:27] conductor. Brother Brandon would talk
[1:26:28] about the conductor. And he would say
[1:26:30] that that a conductor is what channels
[1:26:32] electricity, right? It's what brings
[1:26:35] electricity through it. And he says this
[1:26:37] word is your conductor. And he says the
[1:26:40] Holy Spirit follows the word. Whenever
[1:26:43] the word is preached, he says the Holy
[1:26:45] Spirit follows that word. He says when,
[1:26:48] and I'll just read it to you. He says,
[1:26:49] "See, that's the thing that delivers the
[1:26:51] word." The word goes right out and the
[1:26:54] Holy Spirit follows the word. Wherever
[1:26:56] the word is preached, you see your
[1:26:58] pastor preach it. The first thing you
[1:27:00] know, and he says, he says, "Across the
[1:27:02] building comes the Holy Ghost." See,
[1:27:04] that's right. It's the conductor of the
[1:27:07] word. The word is the conductor of the
[1:27:09] spirit because where the word is
[1:27:11] preached, the spirit follows it.
[1:27:14] Wherever it goes, why? The Holy Spirit
[1:27:16] follows the word. Oh my. Ain't that
[1:27:19] wonderful that wherever the word is
[1:27:21] preached, the spirit of God follows that
[1:27:24] word. And where the spirit of the Lord
[1:27:26] is, there was what? Liberty. There's
[1:27:29] liberty from sickness. There's liberty
[1:27:31] from mind battles. So, as long as we're
[1:27:33] preaching the word of God, there's the
[1:27:36] conductor that is channeling the spirit
[1:27:38] of God in every situation. That's why I
[1:27:41] believe if you want a revival in your
[1:27:43] home, play the message. Right? If you
[1:27:45] want a revival in your children's life,
[1:27:47] play the message and let the word of God
[1:27:50] channel the Holy Spirit, be a conductor
[1:27:53] for the supernatural to come and
[1:27:55] manifest itself in the lives of everyone
[1:27:58] around you. Brother Brand, I'm going to
[1:28:00] say this. God wants eagles. He wants
[1:28:01] Messiah ads. He wants men and women who
[1:28:04] have signs and wonders, anointed ones.
[1:28:06] He wants a church that's filled with the
[1:28:09] Holy Ghost. A church reflecting him the
[1:28:12] same yesterday, today, and forever. God
[1:28:15] didn't die. He just borne the kingdom.
[1:28:17] Oh, hallelujah. My He says, "God didn't
[1:28:20] die. Now he's in you." You see, the
[1:28:23] spirit of God didn't go away with
[1:28:24] Christ. And now, now God's just in
[1:28:26] heaven, but now deity is in humanity.
[1:28:29] Oh, come on now. That's why he says,
[1:28:31] "I'll never leave you, never forsake. I
[1:28:33] won't leave you comfortless, but I'll
[1:28:35] come and be with you. I'm not just going
[1:28:37] to walk with you, but I'm going to even
[1:28:39] be in you." Oh, hallelujah. He says he
[1:28:43] just born a kingdom. He's got Messiah in
[1:28:45] it. Amen. Every word he says, they say
[1:28:49] amen to him. That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:28:51] They look like him. They act like him.
[1:28:54] They believe it. Got the conductor
[1:28:56] moving right on out with signs and
[1:28:58] wonders. That's the Messiah. Messiah
[1:29:01] lives today. He isn't dead. He's alive
[1:29:05] forever more. And brother Brandon
[1:29:07] preached the message called Messiah. And
[1:29:09] we said, "What is the Messiah?" He says
[1:29:11] it's the kingdom. He says it's the
[1:29:13] kingdom of God inside of you. He says
[1:29:16] we're miniature messiahes, right? He
[1:29:18] says we're we're we're miniature gods.
[1:29:19] You can speak the word. He talked about
[1:29:21] Adam. Hell, that Adam was a minor god
[1:29:24] under Jehovah, right? It was it was Adam
[1:29:26] that would speak the would create the
[1:29:28] the names of the animals, right? Call
[1:29:30] this one. Call this one a lion. Call
[1:29:32] this one a tiger. And I don't believe
[1:29:35] that it was just Adam coming out and
[1:29:37] being like, I'm going to call you tiger.
[1:29:39] I'm going to call you lion. But I
[1:29:41] believe there was an inspiration that
[1:29:42] whenever the lion would come forth, he
[1:29:44] would see him and then would be
[1:29:46] inspired. That's a lion, right? That
[1:29:48] one's a giraffe. That's a tiger. He was
[1:29:50] a minor. God, brother Brandon would
[1:29:53] teach us that if it was hot, he needed a
[1:29:55] tree. He would say if he plucked up and
[1:29:57] planted over here, right? He would speak
[1:29:59] to the storm. If the storm was coming,
[1:30:02] he would speak to the storm. And it
[1:30:03] would go out of existence. He was a
[1:30:05] minor god under Jehovah. But because of
[1:30:08] sin, right, he lay fell from that
[1:30:11] dominion. Now he's running from the
[1:30:13] storm, right? Instead of speaking to the
[1:30:15] storm, he's running from Leo the lion.
[1:30:17] Instead of p petting Leo the lion, he
[1:30:20] fell from this position. But because of
[1:30:23] the Holy Ghost, this kingdom has been
[1:30:26] restored into the hearts of the believer
[1:30:29] that now you're a miniature Messiah Ed,
[1:30:31] as well. Oh, you might not be speaking
[1:30:33] to the tiger. You might not you might
[1:30:36] not be speaking squirrels into
[1:30:37] existence, but you can still take the
[1:30:39] word of God and speak it over your
[1:30:42] emotions. Speak it over your feelings.
[1:30:44] Speak it over your five senses. And that
[1:30:46] that dominion starts to reflect itself
[1:30:49] in every one of your lives. Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] Brother Brown, I'm going say this here.
[1:30:54] Now, this is now that is true. God
[1:30:56] called meas. God called us. And we
[1:30:59] become kings and priests unto God. Like
[1:31:02] Jesus was God, God's high priest. We
[1:31:04] become a lesser priest. God Jesus was
[1:31:07] God in fullness dwelt in him to shine
[1:31:10] forth the expression of God to the
[1:31:12] world. For God was in Christ
[1:31:15] reconciling the world to himself. And as
[1:31:19] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:31:21] to himself, God comes into the church
[1:31:24] and anoints him some Messiah S. He says,
[1:31:27] "Oh my, do you see it? The same things
[1:31:30] he did in his church, the same power he
[1:31:33] has in this church. And his church
[1:31:36] becomes his dominion. And he's the king
[1:31:39] over this dominion. He says, "There you
[1:31:42] are messiahs, little messiahs, little
[1:31:45] anointed ones, anointed off of what? The
[1:31:47] main one. Anointed off of the great
[1:31:50] one." Oh my. What is it? We've
[1:31:52] recognized the Messiah is in our midst.
[1:31:54] And brother Brandham at in that message
[1:31:56] he would he he would tell us that the
[1:31:58] Messiah when he when Christ come upon
[1:32:00] the earth he was the Messiah. He was the
[1:32:02] word. He he he he was channeling the the
[1:32:05] word and manifesting it. And in order to
[1:32:07] to to to uh uh be a reflection of that
[1:32:11] Messiah, you had to recognize him,
[1:32:13] right? The scribes and Pharisees would
[1:32:15] say this man's bea, you know, he's a man
[1:32:18] maketh himself God. But then there was a
[1:32:20] woman at the well and it's I think it's
[1:32:22] so powerful. as we heard on heard on
[1:32:24] Wednesday night brother Miguel was
[1:32:25] preaching that Jesus would say I have
[1:32:27] needs to go by Samaria. Why was there a
[1:32:30] need to go by there? Because there was
[1:32:32] somebody that was redeemable and and as
[1:32:35] the woman at the well would come to this
[1:32:37] position, come to the spot. He would say
[1:32:40] to her, right? Give me something to
[1:32:42] drink. We all know the story. You know
[1:32:44] that the the we have no dealings with
[1:32:46] each other. You're a Jew. I'm a Samaran.
[1:32:48] He would say, "If you knew who I was,
[1:32:50] you would ask of me to drink. Well, the
[1:32:52] well is deep. You got no bucket to get
[1:32:54] water with." Right? But then he says,
[1:32:56] then he starts to discern her heart. Go
[1:32:58] get your husband. I don't got a husband.
[1:33:01] Well, you you speak the truth for you
[1:33:03] have five. The one you're living with
[1:33:04] now, it's not yours. It was the Messiah
[1:33:07] performing the Messiah sign. But then
[1:33:10] there was somebody that was
[1:33:12] predestinated for the kingdom would
[1:33:15] recognize this is the Messiah. She would
[1:33:18] say, "I perceive you're a prophet. But
[1:33:20] when he come, when the Messiah comes, he
[1:33:23] would do these things." He would say, "I
[1:33:25] am he." What happened? She dropped her
[1:33:27] water pots. She dropped the very thing
[1:33:30] that was hindering her from seeing the
[1:33:32] Messiah. Once she realized who was in
[1:33:35] her midst, she she dropped it and she
[1:33:38] would run into the city, come see a man,
[1:33:41] brother Brown, I'm going say this here.
[1:33:43] But when Jesus turned and said, I am he
[1:33:45] that speaks with you. There was no such
[1:33:48] expression as Beza. But she left her
[1:33:51] water pot, ran into the city, and said,
[1:33:54] "Come see a man who have told me the
[1:33:56] things that I have done. Isn't this the
[1:33:59] very Messiah?" Now what did this putting
[1:34:02] the old scripture with that experience
[1:34:05] Jesus was given to her. What did it do?
[1:34:08] It made the Messiah. And he says now
[1:34:10] notice quickly her sins were forgiven
[1:34:14] because at the beginning she was
[1:34:16] redeemable because she was in God's
[1:34:18] thinking at the beginning. So it
[1:34:21] redeemed her or brought it back. And so
[1:34:24] in the in the mind of God, she wasn't a
[1:34:27] harlot. In the mind of God, she she was
[1:34:30] she didn't have mistakes and failures.
[1:34:31] In the mind of God, she was perfect. And
[1:34:34] as she recognized the Messiah, it would
[1:34:37] bring her back to the thoughts that God
[1:34:39] had for her. That's why there's no
[1:34:41] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:34:44] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Once we're born
[1:34:46] into the kingdom, our past is forgiven.
[1:34:50] How come, Brother Josh? Because we were
[1:34:52] from the beginning redeemable.
[1:34:54] Hallelujah. Brother Brown and Ben would
[1:34:56] tell us that that he says that that God
[1:34:59] can get a hold of a bunch of people to
[1:35:01] manifest this power in every dimension.
[1:35:04] And so, not only was she liberated from
[1:35:07] her water pots, but she was liberated
[1:35:09] from condemnation. You see, the devil
[1:35:12] don't just fight in this dimension, but
[1:35:14] there's other dimensions, right? Brother
[1:35:15] Brandon would tell us that there's
[1:35:17] dimensions where demons are at, right?
[1:35:19] He would tell us that there's the fourth
[1:35:21] dimension which is where where where
[1:35:22] television is radio waves and and
[1:35:25] pictures. And he says what the
[1:35:26] television does, it channels that other
[1:35:29] dimension, right? Can you see pictures
[1:35:31] going through here right now? Can you
[1:35:33] hear radio? Hear the radio, but it's
[1:35:35] coming through here, but it's in another
[1:35:37] dimension. And I love that because the
[1:35:40] devil comes in other dimensions. He
[1:35:42] don't where you can't see him. But he
[1:35:44] still comes and he fights your mind. He
[1:35:46] fights your body. He fight your spirit
[1:35:48] man. Brother Brandham says that we will
[1:35:51] manifest his power in every dimension.
[1:35:55] Oh, so the dimension of television will
[1:35:57] overcome that, right? The dimension of
[1:35:59] social media or of YouTube or or of
[1:36:02] movies, there's a power on the inside
[1:36:05] that we can manifest his authority even
[1:36:08] in that other dimension. Hallelujah. I
[1:36:11] believe there's a kingdom people that's
[1:36:13] manifesting the power of God. Amen. Man,
[1:36:17] you believe that this morning?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And I I even preached an hour yet, so
[1:36:20] just give me a few more minutes. You
[1:36:22] see, brother Brandwood would tell us
[1:36:23] that there's a kingdom inside of you
[1:36:26] that when you can conquer the gates of
[1:36:28] your enemy, and it's incredible because
[1:36:30] because this is my last thought I want
[1:36:32] to get to here because sometimes that we
[1:36:35] think that once we fall, there's no
[1:36:37] grace for us to get back up. And you
[1:36:39] see, there's difference between
[1:36:41] condemnation and conviction, right?
[1:36:43] Condemnation points out your mistakes
[1:36:46] and says there's no future for you. But
[1:36:48] conviction points out the mistake and
[1:36:51] says there's grace for you. Right?
[1:36:53] There's a difference between
[1:36:54] condemnation and conviction because
[1:36:57] we're in our flesh. We're going to make
[1:36:58] mistakes. We're going to make flaws and
[1:37:01] and failures. But there's a grace that
[1:37:04] can that that causes us to persevere.
[1:37:07] And it was the apostle Paul that was
[1:37:09] that was there in I believe he was in
[1:37:11] prison and he would cry unto the Lord
[1:37:13] three times and would say the devil
[1:37:15] buffets me. And brother Brandham would
[1:37:17] tell us the word buffet is what? Blow
[1:37:20] after blow after blow. Right? And he
[1:37:22] would cry unto the Lord. Take this
[1:37:24] affirmity from me. In other words, then
[1:37:27] he would type this affirmity to a thorn
[1:37:29] in his flesh. Not a thorn in his soul,
[1:37:32] but a thorn in his flesh. His flesh was
[1:37:35] weak. And I love it because the Lord
[1:37:37] didn't take him out of that affirming or
[1:37:40] take the the thorn out of his flesh, but
[1:37:43] he says, "My grace is sufficient for
[1:37:46] thee." In other words, you're going to
[1:37:48] go, "Your flesh is going to be tempted.
[1:37:50] Your flesh is going to be tried. Your
[1:37:52] flesh is going to be hammered. But my
[1:37:55] grace is enough for you to persevere."
[1:37:59] Then what would the Apostle Paul say? I
[1:38:01] will glory in my affirmities. So, he
[1:38:03] went from crying about it and whining
[1:38:05] about it to now I'm going to praise God.
[1:38:08] Even though the thorn is still in my
[1:38:10] flesh, even though my flesh is still
[1:38:13] weak, even though my flesh is still beat
[1:38:16] down, my mind is beat down, there's a
[1:38:18] grace that is more than enough that I
[1:38:21] can still praise God in the hard times.
[1:38:24] I can still praise God because I know
[1:38:27] I'm of another kingdom. and you will
[1:38:29] look at Jesus and it's always it's
[1:38:31] always whenever you're at your weakest
[1:38:32] moment that the devil comes against your
[1:38:35] flesh. Brother Brandon tell us that the
[1:38:37] devil only comes when he thinks he has
[1:38:39] the upper hand. Right? And here Jesus,
[1:38:42] the Bible says he was led into the
[1:38:44] wilderness to be tempted. And you notice
[1:38:46] that the Bible says it was after the
[1:38:48] 40th day that the tempter came and
[1:38:50] tempted Jesus. How come he didn't come
[1:38:53] on the first day or the second day or
[1:38:54] the third day? Because his flesh was
[1:38:56] strong. His mind was strong, but at the
[1:38:59] 40th day, his flesh was weak. He was
[1:39:02] hungry. He was tired. He had been
[1:39:05] fastened. He his body was beat down.
[1:39:08] That's when the tempter came. You see,
[1:39:10] the devil don't come when your flesh is
[1:39:12] strong. He don't come whenever whenever
[1:39:14] you're you're in a revival meeting or a
[1:39:16] youth camp and you felt charged by the
[1:39:18] Holy Ghost. But he comes when you're
[1:39:20] back home, right? Whenever your your
[1:39:22] your body is sick or you're having mind
[1:39:24] battles, that's when he comes. And he
[1:39:27] says, "Man, you never had in the first
[1:39:28] place, right? You you you you really
[1:39:31] didn't receive the Holy Ghost. You
[1:39:32] really didn't get delivered. You really
[1:39:34] your life ain't really changed." He's
[1:39:36] coming when your flesh is weak because
[1:39:38] he knows if your flesh is weak, that's
[1:39:41] the best way to get to your soul. But
[1:39:43] what would Jesus say? The Bible would
[1:39:45] tell us that the tentor came to him and
[1:39:47] would say, "If thou be the son of God,
[1:39:49] make stones in the bread." What would
[1:39:51] Jesus say? It is also written. In other
[1:39:53] words, there was a there was a there was
[1:39:56] a an inspiration, a discernment to know
[1:40:00] that the devil's coming with scripture,
[1:40:02] but he's misinterpreting the scripture.
[1:40:05] And we got to realize that every time
[1:40:07] the devil comes, it's a lie. How do you
[1:40:09] know if the devil's lying? Right? When
[1:40:11] his mouth's moving, right? He can come
[1:40:13] with quotes, he can come with
[1:40:14] scriptures, but he can twist them up.
[1:40:17] And now, instead of bringing conviction,
[1:40:19] he's bringing condemnation. He brings
[1:40:21] the word of God. and say, "See, you send
[1:40:24] your day of grace away. You wasn't
[1:40:25] really, you never had the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:27] You never this and that." He He can take
[1:40:29] messages from behind the pullpit and
[1:40:32] bring them to condemn you. What he's
[1:40:34] doing is the same thing he done to
[1:40:36] Jesus. But what did Jesus say? It is
[1:40:39] also written. Come on now. Even when my
[1:40:42] flesh is weak and the devil's bringing
[1:40:45] scriptures against you, there's no
[1:40:47] scripture that condemns you when you're
[1:40:49] in Christ. It might convict you, but it
[1:40:52] don't condemn you. Hallelujah. This is
[1:40:55] the father's will, the word of God. And
[1:40:57] it's incredible because he would say,
[1:40:59] "It is also written." You look at John 6
[1:41:02] and37. And all that the father hath
[1:41:04] given me shall come to me. Him that
[1:41:06] cometh to me, I will no wise cast out.
[1:41:10] So there you go. You can never send your
[1:41:12] day of grace away. The Bible is saying
[1:41:14] in John 6:39, "And this is the father's
[1:41:17] will which has sent me that that of all
[1:41:20] which he hath given me. I shall lose
[1:41:23] nothing but shall raise it up again at
[1:41:25] the last day. I know them that are mine.
[1:41:28] Your name is engraved in the palm of my
[1:41:30] hand." So in other words, you can never
[1:41:33] be lost. So when the devil comes when
[1:41:35] your flesh is weak and says you are
[1:41:37] lost, bring him back to the scripture
[1:41:40] and say, "But it is also written." When
[1:41:42] he comes and he says, "You can't get
[1:41:44] your healing." Bring it back to the
[1:41:46] scripture. Say, "Even though my flesh is
[1:41:48] weak, the kingdom is in my soul, not in
[1:41:51] my flesh. The kingdom's in my soul, not
[1:41:54] in my spirit, man." And bring your body
[1:41:57] into subjection. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:42:01] that's when the devil gets on the run,
[1:42:03] man. You want to get the devil on the
[1:42:04] run? Bring your body into subjection.
[1:42:06] You remember the story of David and
[1:42:08] Goliath? We've heard as a as a kid
[1:42:09] growing up, right? The Bible would tell
[1:42:12] us that the the armies of the
[1:42:13] Philistines was boasting against the
[1:42:15] Israelites, right? And there how come
[1:42:17] they were boasting because of Goliath,
[1:42:20] right? I mean, they their champion never
[1:42:21] been defeated and here Goliath said,
[1:42:23] "Man, if you have a man, send him out to
[1:42:25] fight me." But something changed when
[1:42:27] the Bible tell us that whenever Goliath
[1:42:30] was brought down, the Bible says that
[1:42:32] the Philistines ran. What happened?
[1:42:35] Their greatest weapon was brought into
[1:42:38] subjection. Oh, come on now. Then what
[1:42:41] would happen once their greatest weapon
[1:42:43] was brought into subjection? It was no
[1:42:46] longer the Philistines chasing the
[1:42:48] Israelites, but now it was reversed. Now
[1:42:50] it's the Israelites chasing the
[1:42:53] Philistines because their champion was
[1:42:55] brought into subjection. And what did
[1:42:57] brother Brandham tell us? Who's your
[1:42:59] greatest enemy? He says, not the devil,
[1:43:01] not your neighbor, but you're your
[1:43:03] greatest enemy. So once you bring that
[1:43:06] your body into subjection, which is the
[1:43:09] devil's champion, that's when the roles
[1:43:12] get reversed. That's when you say,
[1:43:13] "Devil, get out of my way. Give me my
[1:43:16] joy. Give me my peace. Give me my
[1:43:17] healing. Give me the Holy Ghost. Give me
[1:43:20] my loved ones. I'm bringing your
[1:43:22] greatest champion in the subjection."
[1:43:24] There's a grace for your flesh.
[1:43:28] There's a grace that when the devil's
[1:43:30] boasting over you, there's a grace that
[1:43:33] can bring it into subjection. It was
[1:43:35] David. The Bible would say that that
[1:43:38] that he was distressed. He would come
[1:43:39] back to Ziglag. And the Bible says that
[1:43:42] the enemy would come and would take the
[1:43:45] children, take their wives. And the
[1:43:47] Bible says that David's warriors took up
[1:43:49] stones to stone him. Right? And the
[1:43:52] Bible says he was distressed. But then
[1:43:54] he encouraged himself in the Lord. His
[1:43:57] spirit was distressed. His flesh was
[1:44:00] distressed. But there was a soul that
[1:44:02] was anchored and thou would encourage
[1:44:05] himself. Then what would happen after
[1:44:07] that? The Bible says the Lord would
[1:44:08] speak to David and would say, "Pursue,
[1:44:11] for you shall surely overtake them all."
[1:44:14] In other words, even though your flesh
[1:44:17] is weak, let that soul speak. Come on.
[1:44:20] that we're always letting our flesh
[1:44:21] speak. We're always letting our spirit
[1:44:23] man speak. How about you let that soul
[1:44:25] speak and speak the promises of God.
[1:44:28] Speak that there's a rapture for me.
[1:44:30] Speak that there's a there's a a
[1:44:31] marriage supper of the lamb. There's a
[1:44:33] body changed and there's nothing the
[1:44:34] devil can do to keep me out of it. Let
[1:44:37] that soul speak and pursue. Oh man, I
[1:44:41] say pursue a revival. And it's
[1:44:43] incredible because the Bible would tell
[1:44:45] us that they're they're in ziglag that
[1:44:47] the I think it was the Amalachites would
[1:44:49] take the would take the wives and would
[1:44:51] take the children. But the Bible says
[1:44:53] they only took them. They didn't kill
[1:44:55] them. I think I've used it here before.
[1:44:57] And I love that because the devil can
[1:44:59] take your joy, but he can't kill it.
[1:45:01] Right? He can take your peace, but he
[1:45:03] can't kill it. He can take your
[1:45:05] happiness. He might take your revival,
[1:45:07] but he can't kill it. But let that soul
[1:45:10] speak and say, "Pursue.
[1:45:14] Pursue." Let our musicians come this
[1:45:16] morning. And I say that this morning.
[1:45:18] Pursue. Even when the flesh is weary,
[1:45:22] the flesh is weak. There's a kingdom on
[1:45:24] the inside, but it's not an earthly
[1:45:26] dominion. Not not a not a not a fleshly
[1:45:29] dominion, but it's a heavenly kingdom
[1:45:32] inside of that soul. And man, the more
[1:45:35] you bring your body into subjection,
[1:45:37] it's incredible because I've got so much
[1:45:39] more here, but let let me let me let me
[1:45:41] let me close with this here. Brother
[1:45:43] Brandham would tell us that he would
[1:45:45] that Jesus was the creator. And I think
[1:45:47] this is so powerful that that he when he
[1:45:50] when he was upon the boat and the winds
[1:45:52] and the waves was coming against that
[1:45:54] boat. Brother Brandham says Jesus was
[1:45:56] the creator and he says the winds and
[1:45:58] the waves was the creation. And he says
[1:46:01] that when he spoke the word, he says the
[1:46:04] winds and the waves had to obey him
[1:46:07] because they was the creation. He was
[1:46:10] the creator. And he says so is it with
[1:46:12] us today? He says he created our bodies.
[1:46:15] He says he's the creator. And so now
[1:46:18] can't he bring our thoughts into
[1:46:20] subjection? Can he bring our body into
[1:46:23] subjection? He says what a position. We
[1:46:26] are secured. He created those bodies.
[1:46:29] And then he would tell us that he says
[1:46:31] even whenever you're you're nothing but
[1:46:33] a spoonful of dust. He says you're dead
[1:46:36] in the grave. He says that body is still
[1:46:39] in subjection. He says whenever the
[1:46:41] voice of resurrection, he says whenever
[1:46:44] whenever he he says notice God will make
[1:46:46] our body so obey him that he said in St.
[1:46:49] John the 6th chapter, he that eats my
[1:46:51] flesh, drink my blood has everlasting
[1:46:53] life and I will raise him up in the last
[1:46:55] day. Think of it. Our bodies when that
[1:46:58] think of it. Our bodies when we have no
[1:47:00] more control of it turns back to a
[1:47:02] spoonful of dust. God will speak to that
[1:47:05] body and will raise it up again in the
[1:47:08] likeness of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:47:11] Christ. He says, "What are you worried
[1:47:13] about? If it's in God's hands, let go.
[1:47:16] For he will raise it up." He promised to
[1:47:18] do it. That's thus saith the Lord. Oh
[1:47:22] my. Everything has to obey him. Nature
[1:47:24] has to obey him. He's the creator of all
[1:47:27] nature.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; So even if we go by the way of the
[1:47:30] grave, I'm I'm in such subjection. It
[1:47:34] was like Elisha. The quickening power
[1:47:36] was upon Elisha. He was in the tomb,
[1:47:38] right? He was in a cave. And there was a
[1:47:40] battle that was going on. There's a dead
[1:47:42] soldier that would throw that soldier
[1:47:43] into the cave. And as soon as that
[1:47:45] soldier would touch the bones of Elisha,
[1:47:48] he would come back to life. Brother
[1:47:49] Brandham says quickening power was still
[1:47:51] with those bones. Even if we go by the
[1:47:53] way of the grave, quicken in power, it's
[1:47:56] still inside of these bones. Oh my. And
[1:47:59] I say, don't get discouraged this
[1:48:01] morning, little church. Don't get weary
[1:48:03] and welloing. Just bring the body under
[1:48:06] subjection.
[1:48:07] Let's bow our heads this morning.
[1:48:11] Dear heavenly father,
[1:48:13] Lord, we're thankful for your grace and
[1:48:16] your mercy, Lord.
[1:48:18] God, thank you for your your presence
[1:48:20] that we feel here this morning, Lord.
[1:48:23] Lord, thank you for establishing a
[1:48:25] kingdom inside of the hearts of your
[1:48:28] people, Lord, that even when our flesh
[1:48:31] is weary and our flesh gets beaten and
[1:48:34] worn down and and the devil battles us
[1:48:37] and tempts us and tests us,
[1:48:40] there's a kingdom on the inside that can
[1:48:42] bring our flesh into subjection.
[1:48:45] And Lord, I ask if there's There's some
[1:48:48] here this morning that has not delivered
[1:48:51] their will into your hands. May they
[1:48:54] surrender everything to your hands,
[1:48:55] Lord. We love you, Father. We're
[1:48:59] thankful for your mercies and your grace
[1:49:01] in Jesus name. Amen. Can we stand and
[1:49:05] sing this this morning?
[1:49:07] Shine all
[1:49:10] around us
[1:49:12] by day
[1:49:15] by night.
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:18] Jesus
[1:49:21] the light of
[1:49:23] the world.
[1:49:26] We sing that again now.
[1:49:29] Walk in
[1:49:31] the light.
[1:49:34] Such a beautiful
[1:49:37] life.
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:56] by day. Yeah.
[1:49:59] By night
[1:50:02] Jesus,
[1:50:04] the light of
[1:50:07] the world.
[1:50:10] Amen. And will God bless you this
[1:50:11] morning? I pray something was said to to
[1:50:14] strengthen and encourage you in some
[1:50:16] way. Remember, there's no service this
[1:50:18] evening. We've dismissed. And so service
[1:50:22] on 7:00 on Wednesday night. Let's
[1:50:25] remember all the ones that are traveling
[1:50:26] back home today and tomorrow that the
[1:50:29] Lord would give them safe travel and
[1:50:30] mercies. And Lord willing, we see y'all
[1:50:33] on Wednesday. God bless y'all. Let's
[1:50:35] sing that one more time as our brothers
[1:50:37] dismiss us now.
[1:50:41] Such a beautiful
[1:50:45] life
[1:50:48] comes when
[1:50:50] the new drops of mercy.
