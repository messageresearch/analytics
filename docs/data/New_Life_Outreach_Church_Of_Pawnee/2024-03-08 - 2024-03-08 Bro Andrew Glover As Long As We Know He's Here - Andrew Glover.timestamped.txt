[57:14] seated here this afternoon I want to by
[57:17] the help of the Lord for just a few
[57:18] moments if I would take a title tonight
[57:20] I want to talk to you on this thought of
[57:22] as long as we know he's here as long as
[57:27] we know that he is here in the message
[57:30] healing and what is sickness 1950
[57:32] brother said we think of one time that
[57:34] we were aliens we were cut off from God
[57:36] without Mercy but Christ died in our
[57:39] stad the innocent for the guilty he said
[57:42] and now we are the sons and daughters of
[57:44] God I love that right now we are the
[57:47] sons and daughters of God it does not
[57:50] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[57:53] we'll have a body like his own glorious
[57:55] body for we shall see him amen as he is
[57:59] free from sickness free from pain he
[58:01] said and God that glorious day of
[58:04] redemption is coming amen for all nature
[58:07] is groaning for that day he said now
[58:09] we're on the very threshold of the door
[58:12] to Break Forth into that great golden
[58:14] age that all the prophets have spoke of
[58:16] signs and wonders has been wrought by
[58:19] thy servants throughout the land now
[58:21] listen at this to turn the people back
[58:23] to a knowledge The Presence of Jehovah
[58:26] God in our midst amen the signs and the
[58:29] Wonders that have been wrought by the
[58:31] Servants of God have been done to turn
[58:34] the church back to a knowledge of The
[58:36] Presence of Jehovah God in our midst you
[58:39] know last night when I got back to my
[58:41] room I was just sitting there and
[58:42] meditating on some things and the spirit
[58:44] of the Lord just spoke these words to My
[58:46] Heart amen that this is a generation
[58:48] that is endued with the knowledge of his
[58:51] presence amen a generation that is in
[58:54] endued with the knowledge of his
[58:56] presence in James 3:13 he said who is a
[58:59] wise man and endued with knowledge among
[59:02] you now look at this endued with
[59:04] knowledge it means that it is
[59:06] intelligent amen it is experienced it is
[59:09] one having the knowledge of an expert
[59:13] amen if you have been endued with
[59:15] knowledge that has not come from
[59:16] somebody that does not know what they're
[59:18] talking about but that has come from
[59:20] somebody that knows exactly what they're
[59:22] talking about amen and when we begin to
[59:25] declare the presence of Jesus Christ
[59:28] we're not declaring that from some
[59:29] psychologist we're not declaring that
[59:31] from some denominational preacher but we
[59:34] are declaring that from a Vindicated
[59:36] Prophet amen who had the ability to say
[59:39] that he's not standing three feet from
[59:41] where I am right now amen he is here I
[59:44] believe it's Moses when he met the
[59:46] burning bush I can say it like this
[59:48] Moses became an
[59:51] expert when Moses met the pillar of fire
[59:54] he became an expert Moses he said after
[59:57] God gave him 40 Years of teaching amen
[59:59] he was 80 years old could you imagine
[1:00:01] how ridiculous to the carnal mind this
[1:00:03] would be amen here was Moses in the
[1:00:06] presence amen of The Burning Bush was
[1:00:09] better equipped Amen in five minutes in
[1:00:11] the presence of God Amen than 80 years
[1:00:14] of school it had give him he said in the
[1:00:16] presence of God five minutes amen gave
[1:00:19] him more knowledge of God and better
[1:00:21] equipped him amen than 80 years of
[1:00:24] schooling brother we don't need so much
[1:00:26] theology amen but we need neology amen 5
[1:00:29] minutes in the presence of the burning
[1:00:31] bush amen 80 years he had shined amen 40
[1:00:35] years on the desert running amen but
[1:00:37] five minutes in the presence of God at
[1:00:40] the burning bush he was ready to go and
[1:00:42] I want to say what we don't need is a
[1:00:44] new quotebook amen we don't need a new
[1:00:46] idea we don't need a new doctrine amen
[1:00:49] but what we need is to get in the
[1:00:50] presence of God until every idea every
[1:00:54] tradition
[1:00:55] every unbelieving Spirit can die in the
[1:00:57] presence of God and we can be raised to
[1:01:00] the power of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:01:03] that it might take eight it might have
[1:01:04] took Moses 80 years Amen to get all the
[1:01:07] theology out of it amen and 40 years in
[1:01:10] the desert amen but five minutes in the
[1:01:12] presence of God Amen showed Moses that
[1:01:15] our God Amen is an ontime God he's an
[1:01:18] end time God every time God let me say
[1:01:21] this tonight my God is always on time my
[1:01:25] God is always on time with his message
[1:01:28] he said I believe today we are facing a
[1:01:30] great something amen that the church
[1:01:32] should know and understand we ought to
[1:01:34] know what all this is about amen and Def
[1:01:37] find it in God's word for I believe that
[1:01:39] if it isn't in the word he said that I'm
[1:01:42] just a little bit doubtful of it but if
[1:01:44] God's word speaks of it amen no matter
[1:01:47] how indifferent it might seem to our
[1:01:49] custom of teaching amen it's God working
[1:01:52] out his word and many times it's
[1:01:54] contrary to our way of thinking or maybe
[1:01:57] we've been taught to think amen but we
[1:02:00] have to recognize the omnipotence of God
[1:02:03] when it is performed before us listen I
[1:02:06] believe that our God is an omnipotent
[1:02:08] God and I believe that he has the power
[1:02:11] Amen to come into this building tonight
[1:02:14] and to perform a manifestation of his
[1:02:17] omnipotence to every believer amen the
[1:02:20] same way that he did to Moses the same
[1:02:22] way that he did to Noah the same way
[1:02:24] that he did to Joshua listen we are not
[1:02:26] a bunch of theological intellectual
[1:02:29] Canary Birds amen we are the Bride of
[1:02:31] Jesus Christ and if Moses was led by the
[1:02:34] pillar of fire amen we are led by the
[1:02:36] pillar of fire and wherever the pillar
[1:02:38] of fire goes we will follow the pillar
[1:02:40] of fire because it's not theology it is
[1:02:44] reality amen when God comes in our midst
[1:02:47] he begins to perform the omnipotence and
[1:02:49] we begin to recognize it now when we
[1:02:52] read there in Matthew chap 11 if you
[1:02:54] stud study the message you know that
[1:02:56] brother B calls that the forgotten
[1:02:57] beatitude I love how brother bcll said
[1:03:00] it he said it's the Forgotten beatitude
[1:03:02] rediscovered when you read Matthew 11
[1:03:05] you're not thinking about the Beatitudes
[1:03:08] amen because Matthew 5 is were all there
[1:03:10] recorded amen but in Matthew 11 brother
[1:03:13] says that is the Forgotten beatitude he
[1:03:16] said and what happened amen is John
[1:03:18] found himself in jail now I want to say
[1:03:21] this to you John was not in jail because
[1:03:24] he robbed a bank he was not in jail
[1:03:26] because he was selling drugs or amen
[1:03:28] doing something wrong amen his ministry
[1:03:31] put him in
[1:03:32] jail John's Ministry literally put him
[1:03:36] Amen in the prison cell now I want you
[1:03:38] to think about something amen here is
[1:03:40] John the Baptist amen who goes from the
[1:03:43] Wilderness all the way to the jail amen
[1:03:45] but I want to say this to you amen but
[1:03:48] in the jail he was still John amen now
[1:03:51] let me say what John had amen John had
[1:03:54] an Eagle Eye he had a he had a prophetic
[1:03:56] eye and when John got in the jail
[1:03:59] brother said his Eagle Eye or prophetic
[1:04:01] eye had become filmed over he said now
[1:04:04] watch when trouble set in amen Jesus
[1:04:06] come and showed the Messiah that he was
[1:04:09] Messiah but then something went wrong
[1:04:11] see John had introduced the Messiah with
[1:04:14] a fan in his hand going to burn up the
[1:04:16] cha but he found out amen that the works
[1:04:19] of Jesus was meek and lowly amen so it
[1:04:22] worried him he didn't know what to say
[1:04:24] amen he thought amen now there's
[1:04:27] something wrong here somewhere he said
[1:04:29] seemed he had beli the wrong thing it
[1:04:31] seemed like it wasn't working right and
[1:04:33] there's many times that we think that
[1:04:35] too that it isn't working right amen but
[1:04:38] it is working right he said as long as
[1:04:41] we know that he's here amen then what
[1:04:44] difference does it make amen as long as
[1:04:47] we know as long as the acknowledgement
[1:04:50] has come into our life that Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] is not in a Gra in Jerusalem he's not in
[1:04:56] a tomb in Jeffersonville he's not on the
[1:04:58] cross of Calvary but he's here in the
[1:05:00] power of his resurrection then it can
[1:05:03] rain or it can shine and we'll have
[1:05:05] church it can be cold or it can be warm
[1:05:08] and we'll have church there can be two
[1:05:10] or 200 of us and we'll have church
[1:05:13] because our Revival is not built on the
[1:05:15] knowledge of some man it's not built on
[1:05:18] the knowledge of some system our Revival
[1:05:20] is built on the knowledge that Jesus
[1:05:23] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:26] forever and his word is in the midst of
[1:05:28] his church and he's got the same Dynamic
[1:05:31] power to do exactly what his word said
[1:05:33] he would do listen our Revival is not
[1:05:35] coming from who's not here our Revival
[1:05:38] is coming from who is here and who is
[1:05:40] here is Jesus Christ and he's the king
[1:05:43] of kings he's the Lord of lords he's the
[1:05:46] God that was he oh let me just bag on
[1:05:48] him for a minute he's the god that is
[1:05:50] and he's the god that'll always be he's
[1:05:53] the Everlasting time father he is the
[1:05:55] Prince of Peace he is the counselor he
[1:05:58] is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa he is
[1:06:01] Jehovah n he is Elohim he is Elia he is
[1:06:06] everything and he is in this building
[1:06:09] tonight in the power of his
[1:06:12] resurrection he ain't in a grave in
[1:06:15] Jeffersonville he ain't in a tomb in
[1:06:17] Jerusalem he's here in the power of his
[1:06:20] word and as long as we know he's here
[1:06:24] what difference does it make well I
[1:06:26] might as well preach there for a second
[1:06:28] as long as we know he's here what
[1:06:30] difference does it make well my favorite
[1:06:32] preacher ain't here but he's here well
[1:06:35] my favorite singer ain't here but he's
[1:06:37] here well my best friend ain't here but
[1:06:40] he's here come on church amen well my
[1:06:42] boyfriend or girlfriend ain't here but
[1:06:44] he's here so if he's here we can have
[1:06:47] Camp if he's here the saved can be saved
[1:06:50] if he's here the sick can be healed if
[1:06:53] he's here the dead can be raised if he's
[1:06:56] here the blind eyes can come open if
[1:06:58] he's here the poor can have the gospel
[1:07:01] preached to him if he's here sickness is
[1:07:04] defeated if he's here every devil is
[1:07:10] defeated if he's here as long as we know
[1:07:14] that he's here then what difference does
[1:07:16] it make it's working right maybe it
[1:07:19] working according to the way we think it
[1:07:21] ought to work but it's working according
[1:07:23] to the way God wants it to work now
[1:07:26] there's a powerful point right there
[1:07:28] things will not always work the way you
[1:07:30] think they ought to work but what
[1:07:32] difference does it make if it's working
[1:07:35] the way God thinks it all to work for my
[1:07:37] Bible says that we know all things work
[1:07:40] together for the good to them who are
[1:07:42] the called according Amen to his purpose
[1:07:46] now let me say this when trouble sets in
[1:07:48] is when people
[1:07:50] forget when trouble begins to set in is
[1:07:54] when people begin to forget can I say
[1:07:56] this what we forget is what we should
[1:07:59] remember and what we remember is what we
[1:08:01] should forget see right now amen some of
[1:08:05] you are remembering situations that you
[1:08:07] should have forgot a long time ago and
[1:08:09] forgetting the promise of God as the
[1:08:12] change to the situation you are
[1:08:14] remembering the sickness but you're
[1:08:16] forgetting Isaiah 53 you're forgetting
[1:08:18] the cross of Calvary you're forgetting
[1:08:20] the atonement you're forgetting the
[1:08:22] stripes that was placed upon is back
[1:08:24] amen but what about tonight if you can
[1:08:26] forget about the sickness and remember
[1:08:29] the healer if you can forget about the
[1:08:31] problem and remember the answer if you
[1:08:33] can forget about the question and
[1:08:35] remember that Jesus Christ is Arisen
[1:08:37] from the grave and he's here in power to
[1:08:40] manifest himself amen we ought to forget
[1:08:43] what we we shouldn't forget what we
[1:08:44] should remember but we ought to forget
[1:08:47] we ought to forget the things that has
[1:08:49] no value to them now Matthew y'all are
[1:08:51] preaching me I'm trying to lay a
[1:08:53] foundation but don't quit in Matthew
[1:08:55] chapter 11 the Bible said that John amen
[1:08:58] literally goes to Jesus and asks him two
[1:09:00] questions he says now aren't thou he
[1:09:02] that should come amen or do we look for
[1:09:04] another now as long as John was on the
[1:09:06] River Jordan baptizing there was no
[1:09:08] question as long as John was preaching
[1:09:11] there was no question but the minute
[1:09:13] that trouble set in is when John begin
[1:09:15] to say are you the Messiah or do we look
[1:09:18] for another you see what happened was
[1:09:20] amen that questioning arises in the time
[1:09:23] of trouble you know today the prophet of
[1:09:25] God says we're living in a world that is
[1:09:27] full of
[1:09:29] questioning he says there's a literally
[1:09:31] a question mark over the entire world do
[1:09:34] you realize right now there's a question
[1:09:36] mark over the White House there's a
[1:09:38] question mark over the nomination
[1:09:40] there's a question mark over education
[1:09:42] there's a question there's a question
[1:09:44] mark all over the world Amen and what
[1:09:46] Satan has done is he's trying to move
[1:09:49] people from Faith to doubt amen by one
[1:09:52] simple thing and that's to get you to
[1:09:54] question do you realize when you're on
[1:09:56] the mountain you never question if God
[1:09:58] loves you when the bank account's full
[1:10:00] you never question if God loves you when
[1:10:02] everything's working just right you
[1:10:04] never question if God is for you but the
[1:10:07] minute things start falling apart and
[1:10:09] the clouds start gathering in the sky
[1:10:11] and something goes wrong and something
[1:10:13] falls apart is the very minute the Devil
[1:10:15] comes in and begins to move you from
[1:10:18] Faith to doubt and you begin to say well
[1:10:20] I don't know if God loves me and I don't
[1:10:22] know if this message is for me amen I
[1:10:24] don't know if I'm going to make the
[1:10:25] Rapture I don't know if I'm an overcomer
[1:10:28] amen but I come here tonight to say Amen
[1:10:30] that we're not a bunch of babies but we
[1:10:32] are adopted manifested sons of God and
[1:10:35] we have been endued amen with the
[1:10:37] knowledge of his presence I'll tell you
[1:10:39] why the devil hates us amen it's cuz we
[1:10:42] know how to take a licking and keep on
[1:10:44] chicken we know how to take a bad day
[1:10:46] and keep on praise and we know how to
[1:10:48] take trials and disappointments and
[1:10:51] every negative thing the devil can throw
[1:10:52] at us and still lift up her hands and
[1:10:55] say but God was on my side it don't
[1:10:58] matter who's against me if the Lord is
[1:11:00] for me that I'm going to make it I've
[1:11:03] already made
[1:11:05] it I'm talking about some young people
[1:11:08] I'm talking about a generation that has
[1:11:10] been baptized with a Heavenly knowledge
[1:11:13] of the virtues of the perfect man you
[1:11:16] know that God is right you know his word
[1:11:18] is true and you know he's
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:22] here
[1:11:24] hey somebody shout he's here the devil
[1:11:27] tried to get John to disbelieve amen
[1:11:30] that Jesus was the Messiah so what he do
[1:11:32] he put him in jail now when Jesus heard
[1:11:35] that John was in jail brother Frank he
[1:11:37] never put a pamphlet together and nailed
[1:11:39] it to the jail housee and said here's
[1:11:41] how to be happy in jail literature
[1:11:43] remember said no he said you just stay
[1:11:45] on this afternoon's meeting you just
[1:11:47] stay till this is over then you can
[1:11:49] leave see just watch this afternoon's
[1:11:51] meeting and see there's John he he said
[1:11:53] oh my amen now watch after Jesus had the
[1:11:56] meeting I imagine those Disciples of
[1:11:58] John was sitting there they were
[1:12:00] watching every movie made now watch here
[1:12:02] because John had taught them that he was
[1:12:05] the Messiah now can I drop something
[1:12:07] here to you amen that questioning does
[1:12:09] not just begin with
[1:12:12] you but when you begin to question one
[1:12:15] thing it begins to affect everything
[1:12:17] around you in other words John was
[1:12:20] teaching them that Jesus was the Messiah
[1:12:23] but but now that John is in the prison
[1:12:25] he's now teaching his followers a
[1:12:27] question of is he the Messiah or not
[1:12:30] amen I might as well preach I'm here in
[1:12:32] other words amen when you put one
[1:12:34] question mark on one thing in this
[1:12:36] message it don't just stop there but
[1:12:39] you'll put one here and then you'll put
[1:12:41] one there now come on momies and daddies
[1:12:43] amen you put one question mark on the
[1:12:45] way a boy or girl ought to dress it
[1:12:47] won't stop there it'll move to the way
[1:12:49] they ought to be baptized and it'll move
[1:12:51] the way they ought to go to church or
[1:12:52] stay home and let in the tapes amen but
[1:12:54] I think it's time Amen to remove the
[1:12:57] question mark and put an exclamation
[1:12:59] mark across this message it's the truth
[1:13:02] there's no doubt in it there's no
[1:13:04] confusion in it it is the divine
[1:13:06] revelation of Jesus Christ that has been
[1:13:09] revealed in this generation I'm not
[1:13:12] confused Le ought to see is confused but
[1:13:15] I'm not confused I know who I am I know
[1:13:18] what I'm believing I know who called me
[1:13:21] I know who redeemed me I know who just
[1:13:23] ified me I know who Sanctified me I know
[1:13:26] who filled me with the Holy Ghost and I
[1:13:28] know some of these mornings what I'm
[1:13:30] believing it's going to lead me into a
[1:13:32] body
[1:13:34] change I refuse I refuse I refuse to
[1:13:39] question this message it's the truth
[1:13:44] period ain't putting no question marks
[1:13:47] on
[1:13:49] anything so John had questions now the
[1:13:52] disciples have got questions
[1:13:54] but they begin to see what has taking
[1:13:55] place remember since we after the
[1:13:57] service they went over and there was two
[1:13:59] disciples they went back to meet John
[1:14:00] now here's what Jesus said he said you
[1:14:03] go tell John that the lame walk and the
[1:14:06] blind see and the deaf hear and all that
[1:14:10] comes to the meeting is poor but the
[1:14:12] Poor People's got the gospel preached to
[1:14:14] them and tell John not to be scared and
[1:14:19] not to think anything different I'm
[1:14:21] right on schedule everything is running
[1:14:23] right everything's all right I'm right
[1:14:26] on schedule see go tell them there's a
[1:14:28] healing service going on tell them the
[1:14:30] poor is got the gospel preached and the
[1:14:33] power of God is moving among them I'm
[1:14:35] right on schedule are you ready for this
[1:14:37] don't pay attention to nothing else
[1:14:40] don't you pay attention to nothing else
[1:14:42] I am right on schedule I love that word
[1:14:46] schedule it means to arrange or to plan
[1:14:49] for an event to take place at a
[1:14:51] particular time so it's it's not as
[1:14:53] brother Timothy said it's not something
[1:14:55] haphazardly happening he me no what it
[1:14:58] is is God has a schedule he has a
[1:15:01] particular time he has a specific time
[1:15:04] he has an appointed time he has a due
[1:15:07] time are you hearing me and God is not
[1:15:11] behind schedule and he's not ahead of
[1:15:13] schedule but he's right on schedule now
[1:15:16] here's what happened though is John
[1:15:18] finds himself in a prison do you know as
[1:15:21] believer sometimes that we find our in
[1:15:23] the
[1:15:24] prison sometimes as Believers we find
[1:15:27] ourselves in prisons but can I say this
[1:15:30] to you amen that the prison it never
[1:15:33] lessened John's value John was John
[1:15:37] regardless of where he was amen if he
[1:15:39] was at the river of Jordan he was John
[1:15:42] if he was preaching to the to the to the
[1:15:44] Pharisees and Sadducees he was John can
[1:15:47] I say this if he was in the
[1:15:49] prison he was John so what that tells me
[1:15:53] is is is your habitation does not change
[1:15:55] your
[1:15:58] value so so you're right here smack dab
[1:16:02] in the middle of leosia but you're still
[1:16:04] the Queen of Heaven you're right here in
[1:16:07] the middle of confusion but you're still
[1:16:09] an invincible Army you're right here in
[1:16:11] the middle of an age where boys don't
[1:16:13] know if they're boys and girls don't
[1:16:15] know if they're girls but you have been
[1:16:17] endued with the knowledge of Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ to know that as long as he's here
[1:16:22] every everything is okay John was in a
[1:16:25] prison he was there both naturally and
[1:16:27] spiritually can I tell you what kind of
[1:16:29] prison John was in he was in a prison of
[1:16:32] offense now let me just preach to you
[1:16:34] for a minute amen because John was
[1:16:36] offended because things did not turn out
[1:16:39] amen the way he thought they should turn
[1:16:42] out what put you in a prison of offense
[1:16:45] is when things don't turn out the way
[1:16:47] you think they ought to turn out or the
[1:16:49] way you have for them to turn out amen
[1:16:52] and God says no I I got a different plan
[1:16:54] I've got a different thoughts I've got a
[1:16:56] different agenda for your life then what
[1:16:58] you've got to do is either surrender to
[1:17:01] his plan or continue to follow your plan
[1:17:04] and before long you'll be in a prison of
[1:17:06] offense and you'll be offended at
[1:17:08] everybody and
[1:17:09] anybody well we might as well preach
[1:17:12] you'll be offended to singers you'll be
[1:17:14] offended to deacons you'll be offended
[1:17:16] to youth leaders you'll be offended at
[1:17:17] your parents you you you'll be just an
[1:17:20] offense amen because things didn't turn
[1:17:22] out
[1:17:25] well it's here I might as well preach
[1:17:27] well if it would have went this way that
[1:17:28] would have worked out if that hadn't
[1:17:30] happened then I would have had this and
[1:17:31] if they hadn't said that then I would
[1:17:33] have been a and you got all that figured
[1:17:35] out in your mind amen but don't let me
[1:17:37] let me bust your bubble but you're in a
[1:17:39] prison because right now the word's
[1:17:41] going forth and that prison bar has got
[1:17:44] you so tied up you can't even raise your
[1:17:46] hands and say that all things does work
[1:17:49] together for the good to them that love
[1:17:50] God that prison has got you so bad up
[1:17:53] you can't even say yes Lord amen it was
[1:17:56] different than what I imagined but your
[1:17:58] ways are not my ways and your thoughts
[1:18:00] are not my faults but you know what we
[1:18:02] need to do we need to come to a
[1:18:04] realization that it's not in our hands
[1:18:06] it's not in a preacher's hands it's in
[1:18:09] the hands of the man who stepped out on
[1:18:11] nothing and created everything and if he
[1:18:14] can put the stars in their place if he
[1:18:16] can put the sun in its place if he can
[1:18:18] put the moon in its place and he can
[1:18:20] take you and positionally place you
[1:18:23] in the position that God has given you
[1:18:26] don't you ever forget this our thoughts
[1:18:28] according to Isaiah 55 are not his
[1:18:31] thoughts amen our thoughts are lower
[1:18:33] than his thoughts and brother said
[1:18:34] here's what happened he said John be to
[1:18:37] think well I introduced him as a messiah
[1:18:39] he had a fan in his hand he was going to
[1:18:41] purge the floor he was going to take the
[1:18:43] wheat to the garer and I told them that
[1:18:45] the axe was going to be laid to the root
[1:18:47] of the tree and he was going to take all
[1:18:49] the trash and burn it up amen and here
[1:18:51] he is instead instead of a Great Mighty
[1:18:53] Man like
[1:18:55] that here he comes meek and lowly and
[1:18:59] something must have went wrong somewhere
[1:19:02] he said there's no doubt but something's
[1:19:04] wrong somewhere he thought it wasn't
[1:19:07] right modern events 1965 brother man
[1:19:10] picks this up and says see John said oh
[1:19:13] his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly
[1:19:15] Purge the floor brother said John
[1:19:17] thought the Millennium would start right
[1:19:19] then he thought the grain was ready but
[1:19:21] it had to die
[1:19:23] and go into the stalk and come up again
[1:19:25] to make the true bride so in other words
[1:19:28] John was offended because something was
[1:19:30] not happening but it couldn't happen
[1:19:33] because Branson you wasn't even born yet
[1:19:35] it couldn't happen silus cuz you wasn't
[1:19:37] even on the earth yet amen what John was
[1:19:39] talking about was the truth and it was
[1:19:42] God's will it was God's plan but it
[1:19:44] could not happen until the seed went in
[1:19:47] the ground and come back to make a true
[1:19:49] word bride let me just say this amen and
[1:19:52] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you

[1:20:15] generation that has been endued with the
[1:20:18] knowledge of the presence of God listen

[1:20:23] feel you didn't become the bride by the
[1:20:25] church you go to you came by the bride
[1:20:27] by the word of God made manifest in the
[1:20:30] age you were living in John got
[1:20:33] dismayed John got dismayed the same as

[1:21:03] message there's nothing wrong with the
[1:21:05] Holy Ghost there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:07] the pillar of fire the thing that's
[1:21:09] wrong is us and what's made us wrong is
[1:21:12] our thoughts and our agendas and our
[1:21:14] motives and our objectives amen and John
[1:21:17] was offended at Jesus and brother said
[1:21:19] there's more people offended at Jesus

[1:24:11] of God if it moves the church to move
[1:24:14] with them if it causes somebody to cry
[1:24:17] and cry with him but let's get rid of
[1:24:18] all the nonsense and just get back to
[1:24:21] having church again where the power of
[1:24:23] the Holy Ghost broke out in the services
[1:24:26] and the sick were healed and the dead
[1:24:27] were raised and Devils were cast out and
[1:24:30] the anointing had a liberty to bless
[1:24:34] somebody get out of the prison of
[1:24:37] offense and come back to the message of
[1:24:39] the hour and be what God called you to
[1:24:44] be
[1:24:47] offenses now I think that devil got out
[1:24:50] of

[1:25:16] listen to what a prophet said and go
[1:25:18] tell somebody what a prophet said and
[1:25:21] leave all the non out of it and be a
[1:25:23] young man that God can use to slay
[1:25:26] Goliath to slay Philistines by the power
[1:25:29] of the sword of the Lord that's been
[1:25:31] revealed in the generation you're living
[1:25:34] in you say preacher are you trying to
[1:25:36] call preachers no I'm just giving the
[1:25:39] call some Liberty if it's

[1:25:45] young men will sweep this message
[1:25:48] on to the coming of the Lord get out of
[1:25:53] the prison of
[1:25:57] offense oh mercy look at Daniel 12 now
[1:26:01] we're I think that devil got out of here
[1:26:04] we're not going to be offended Believers
[1:26:06] we're going to be Christians we're going
[1:26:08] to be
[1:26:10] grown-ups this ain't the message Got
[1:26:12] Talent it's the house of God this ain't
[1:26:14] America's Got Talent it's the house of
[1:26:17] God this ain't about who's who and who
[1:26:18] did what who said what who sung what
[1:26:21] it's about the Manifest station of the
[1:26:23] glory of God coming in the church to
[1:26:26] heal somebody listen we got a Rapture to
[1:26:28] take we got a body change to step into
[1:26:31] we got a theophany and a future home I
[1:26:34] say lay aside all the childish
[1:26:35] playground games and come back to the
[1:26:38] word of God and stand on the word of God
[1:26:40] and be a word
[1:26:42] bride let all the nonsense go be a new
[1:26:46] generation that's endued with the
[1:26:48] knowledge of the presence of Jesus
[1:26:50] Christ and if I can't get away from and
[1:26:52] if God does call you to preach and you
[1:26:54] stand before five stand there with an
[1:26:56] authority that wherever two or three are
[1:26:59] gathered together in my name there I
[1:27:01] will be in the
[1:27:04] midst if God does call you to sing and
[1:27:06] he send you to the nursing home go down
[1:27:09] there and sing with the anointing of
[1:27:10] Malachi 4 resting upon the gift that God
[1:27:14] has placed in your life come on be a
[1:27:16] Christian and get out of the prison of
[1:27:18] offense and let God have his way in your
[1:27:21] life
[1:27:23] just settle down and be thankful that
[1:27:25] God called you just settle down and be
[1:27:28] thankful that God spared you there were
[1:27:30] Millions lost on the night he saved your
[1:27:32] soul but he saved you for a
[1:27:36] purpose so be what God called you to be
[1:27:39] and let everything else
[1:27:46] go because when we get offended people
[1:27:48] we start having offended
[1:27:51] meetings and can't nobody sing can't
[1:27:53] nobody shout can't nobody Dance Can't
[1:27:55] Nobody run can't nobody enjoy the Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost amen you know what they say they
[1:27:59] say well I'm just preaching they said
[1:28:02] well you know I'm a little bit sick of
[1:28:03] singing this song you don't know like I
[1:28:05] know amen cuz every time they sing it
[1:28:07] somebody jumps up and starts dancing
[1:28:09] amen well has it ever dawned on you that
[1:28:12] maybe they know that God has done
[1:28:14] something for them has it ever dawned on
[1:28:17] you that maybe they was in the Midnight
[1:28:19] Hour and the Holy Ghost come into their
[1:28:21] life and delivered them from a prison I
[1:28:23] it ever dawned on you that maybe they
[1:28:25] didn't have enough joy to come to church
[1:28:27] but somewhere somehow they made it to
[1:28:30] the house of God and they got a little
[1:28:32] bit of Liberty to break out in the
[1:28:34] spirit and enjoy the blessings of God I
[1:28:36] think it's time to break out again in
[1:28:38] the Holy Ghost until we forget Who's Who
[1:28:41] and we forget who's here and who's not
[1:28:44] here and just shout our Sho heels down
[1:28:46] let a bobby pins go and have church
[1:28:49] again with the anointing of the vage
[1:28:51] that Jesus Christ in the midst of his
[1:28:54] church just let Liberty reain
[1:28:58] again if you want to shout shout if you
[1:29:01] want to dance dance if you want to run
[1:29:03] run if you want to cry cry if you want
[1:29:06] to sit sit but whatever you do let us be
[1:29:09] who God called us to
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:19] be now
[1:29:24] it's our
[1:29:27] time it's our
[1:29:29] time we have been waiting to enjoy the
[1:29:35] Revelation that's been sealed in the
[1:29:37] book now I'm I'm May shout
[1:29:41] amen Daniel 12:1 the Bible says time
[1:29:43] shall Michael stand up and the great
[1:29:45] Prince would standing for the TR of the
[1:29:46] people and there shall be a time of
[1:29:48] trouble such as neb was since there was
[1:29:50] a nation even to the same time and at
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:55] time thy people shall be delivered are
[1:29:59] y'all ready for this everyone that shall
[1:30:01] be found written in the
[1:30:07] book so if there's ever been a time for
[1:30:10] somebody to
[1:30:12] shout about the open book now is a time
[1:30:16] to shout because for years people didn't
[1:30:19] know who was in that book that would be
[1:30:22] delivered in the time of trouble but
[1:30:24] today I'm preaching to a generation who
[1:30:27] has been sitting under the voice of
[1:30:29] Malachi th and they have been anointed
[1:30:32] and endued with the knowledge that their
[1:30:34] name was in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[1:30:37] before the foundation of the
[1:30:41] world they have received the Revelation
[1:30:44] that they can't no more be lost than God
[1:30:47] can they have received the Revelation
[1:30:49] that they can't no more go to hell when
[1:30:52] God can because they are a Jee seed of
[1:30:55] the almighty God and that knowledge has
[1:30:57] come into their heart and they're not a
[1:30:59] bunch of emotional
[1:31:01] Christians come on they won't talk about
[1:31:03] Bubble dancing let's talk about Bubble
[1:31:04] dancing we ain't bubble dancing we got a
[1:31:06] foundation to dance home and the
[1:31:08] foundation we're dancing on is I saw
[1:31:10] another Mighty Angel come down and he
[1:31:12] was clo with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:31:15] over his head and he had in his hand a
[1:31:17] little book and I handed that book to
[1:31:19] the seventh angel and he tore off the
[1:31:21] seed
[1:31:22] and reveal the Redemption role come on
[1:31:24] church if anybody got a right to Rejoice
[1:31:27] it's the people who has received the
[1:31:29] knowledge that their name is in the role
[1:31:32] for deliverance in the time of
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:41] trouble for in the time of trouble he
[1:31:44] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[1:31:48] secret place of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:31:50] hide me he shall set me
[1:31:52] upon a rock what is a rock in the Bible
[1:31:56] Revelation Psalm 37:39 but the salvation
[1:31:59] of the righteousness of the Lord he is
[1:32:01] their
[1:32:02] strength in the time of trouble buts in
[1:32:06] the midst of a great time of trouble
[1:32:08] that's when Jesus comes in expectation
[1:32:10] 1958 he said the peoples of all the
[1:32:13] religion seems to have something within
[1:32:15] them that calls for someone who has
[1:32:18] created them to help them in a time of
[1:32:21] trouble
[1:32:23] in other words had the book not come
[1:32:25] open you would not have a thoroughly
[1:32:28] secure identity of Who You belong to so
[1:32:31] you could call out but you wouldn't know
[1:32:33] who you was calling to but since the
[1:32:35] book has come open the relationship has
[1:32:38] been restored between the Creator and
[1:32:41] the creation and now when you cry out
[1:32:44] you don't cry God you cry Papa God you
[1:32:48] don't cry God you cry my father are do
[1:32:51] you hear me because there is a
[1:32:53] revelation that has endued you to get
[1:32:56] you through the time of trouble now let
[1:32:58] me just turn a corner here and say this
[1:33:00] to the world the time of trouble is
[1:33:01] scary but to the believer the time of
[1:33:04] trouble is a special
[1:33:07] time to the world it's a scary time but
[1:33:10] to the believer it's a special time you
[1:33:12] say how can you prove that well Psalms
[1:33:14] 46:1 says God is our refuge and he is
[1:33:18] our strength he is a very present help
[1:33:21] in trouble therefore will not we fear
[1:33:24] though the Earth be removed though the
[1:33:25] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:33:27] the sea though the waters therefore Roar
[1:33:29] and be troubled though the mountains
[1:33:31] shake with a swelling thereof amen s
[1:33:34] amen can I say this to you young people
[1:33:36] will you remember this the time of
[1:33:39] trouble is the time of his
[1:33:43] presence will you remember that the time
[1:33:46] of trouble is the time of his presence
[1:33:50] so when you see trouble
[1:33:52] remember he's somewhere close
[1:33:55] by when you find yourself in trouble
[1:33:58] John remember he's somewhere close by
[1:34:02] Brother B tells a very beautiful story
[1:34:04] he said Brother Richard Blair sit here
[1:34:05] he a friend of his where he was actually
[1:34:07] working a man helping a man wire a

[1:34:41] open they knelt down and started praying
[1:34:44] over the little boy and he come back to

[1:35:28] in the time of trouble if there ever was
[1:35:30] trouble was that little boy laying there
[1:35:32] dead on the ground from a shock of

[1:37:34] divine presence let me read this to you
[1:37:36] Christ raised from the dead and is Among
[1:37:38] Us somebody say Amen we've seen all
[1:37:40] kinds of great moves shouting praising
[1:37:42] God that's all fine we spoke in tongues
[1:37:44] prophesied all we've seen all that
[1:37:46] that's fine that comes right along with
[1:37:48] it but remember the last thing is his
[1:37:51] divine presence the word itself he is
[1:37:55] the word the head the word amen is
[1:37:58] coming to the body he said now it's not
[1:38:00] some man here is the Messiah it's the
[1:38:02] holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and
[1:38:05] the Holy Spirit is the same thing so
[1:38:08] here it is here now just working in the
[1:38:11] flesh getting the body ready for the
[1:38:14] rapturing grace believe it
[1:38:18] friends believe the knowledge of his
[1:38:21] presence is preparing you for the
[1:38:24] translation of your body now how many
[1:38:26] knows Bram preaches a sermon called The
[1:38:28] Rapture you familiar with that 1965 he
[1:38:31] preaches it and he goes and says I'm
[1:38:33] going to read psalms 27 and he says now
[1:38:36] psalms 27 is the background for the
[1:38:38] Rapture most people thought he would
[1:38:40] read 1 Thessalonians 4 is his open in
[1:38:42] text or 1 Corinthians 15 but he took
[1:38:44] psalms 27 and said now it's the
[1:38:47] background for the Rapture when he
[1:38:48] preaches that look at this word
[1:38:50] background it is the setting in which an
[1:38:53] event takes place so the background
[1:38:55] brother mcki is the setting of which an
[1:38:58] event takes place what is a schedule it
[1:39:01] is to arrange or plan an event to take
[1:39:03] place at a particular
[1:39:07] time oh I wish I had some shout room
[1:39:10] right now are you hearing me the
[1:39:12] schedule is to arrange for an event to
[1:39:15] take place at a particular time but the
[1:39:18] background is the setting that that
[1:39:21] takes place in and Bam says these words
[1:39:24] we are facing the greatest event he said
[1:39:26] I'm here to fulfill the purpose I
[1:39:28] believe that the Lord Jesus sent me to
[1:39:29] help do that was to unite the body of
[1:39:32] Jesus Christ together it's my purpose to
[1:39:35] do that that's what's in my heart to see
[1:39:37] all of God's children in one Accord with
[1:39:39] one heart moving on then I believe when
[1:39:41] that takes place the work will about be
[1:39:44] over then the Millennium will sit in the
[1:39:47] Rapture will come we're certainly
[1:39:49] praying and watching and waiting for
[1:39:51] that time for we're looking forward to
[1:39:54] the greatest event that has ever
[1:39:56] happened in all human history or ever
[1:39:58] will it is the second coming of our Lord
[1:40:01] Jesus Christ the son of God to catch a
[1:40:04] church to himself and to take her to
[1:40:07] himself even nature itself is calling

[2:03:22] our faith with his being here and it
[2:03:25] will happen said see God's always been
[2:03:27] here in some form he's been here in the
[2:03:29] form of a light in the form of a man in
[2:03:31] the form of the son of Jesus Christ he
[2:03:33] said but he is now here speaking through
[2:03:35] his church today through the anointed
[2:03:38] Church of the Living God through the
[2:03:40] vessels of clay you say preacher why did
[2:03:42] you take time to clean up the vessels
[2:03:44] because that is the vessel that God's
[2:03:46] going to dwell in and God don't live in
[2:03:49] a filthy house brother said now watch he
[2:03:51] said we believe the report of Jesus
[2:03:53] being the Christ the son of God is the
[2:03:55] truth and we know somebody say we know
[2:03:59] we know that he promised to be with us
[2:04:02] in the form of the Holy Spirit Plum to
[2:04:04] the end of the world to the End of the
[2:04:06] Age what did Paul tell us in Philippians
[2:04:08] 2 he said let this mind that was in
[2:04:11] Christ Jesus be also in you so be endued
[2:04:14] with the knowledge of Jesus Christ who
[2:04:17] being in the form of God he thought it
[2:04:19] not robbery to lay aside the godship and
[2:04:22] take on the form of a servant remember
[2:04:25] said now watch he's here today what form
[2:04:27] the same Jesus in The Bride form the
[2:04:30] same power the same church the same
[2:04:32] thing the same word what do you saying
[2:04:35] brother Andrew I'm saying God never
[2:04:37] changes his nature he only changes his
[2:04:40] mask he never changes his nature he only
[2:04:44] changes his mask now I'm I'm I'm
[2:04:47] bringing this down to a close but I want
[2:04:48] to get this to you okay let me say this
[2:04:51] even though we've already said it Jesus
[2:04:53] Christ is here in this building
[2:05:03] tonight Jesus Christ is here in this
[2:05:07] building tonight he said Christ
[2:05:09] returning in the form of the word
[2:05:12] working in human beings and showing the
[2:05:14] signs he promised it would sign it would
[2:05:16] do he promised he would do it he is here
[2:05:20] in the form of a prophetic message now
[2:05:23] can I can I give you something here for
[2:05:24] a second how be it when he the spirit of
[2:05:27] Truth has come he will guide you into
[2:05:30] all truth he shall not speak of himself
[2:05:32] but whatsoever he shall hear shall he
[2:05:34] speak he will show you thanks to come
[2:05:37] look at this word come again it is of
[2:05:39] persons to come from one place to
[2:05:40] another and used of both persons
[2:05:43] arriving at the same place 1953 he said
[2:05:47] now I believe this lady standing here I
[2:05:49] do not know you do I lady I can can I
[2:05:51] read this to you I've never seen you as
[2:05:53] far as I know of we're perfect strangers
[2:05:56] never seen you in my life then well if I
[2:05:58] don't know you and probably you raised
[2:06:00] hundreds and hundreds of miles down here
[2:06:03] probably and then when come down here to
[2:06:05] talk to you why he me raised up in
[2:06:08] Indiana probably you down in Florida so
[2:06:11] she was raised in Florida he was raised
[2:06:14] in Indiana well then when we come
[2:06:15] together to talk one to another we've
[2:06:17] been miles apart but God knowed since
[2:06:20] the before you were born he knowed me
[2:06:22] since before I was born and now I
[2:06:24] believe you're a Christian because your
[2:06:26] spirit seems to be welcome when a
[2:06:28] Christian comes there's just something
[2:06:29] that just welcomes see I get that right
[2:06:31] away it's a holy spirit but now if me
[2:06:34] knowing nothing of you and miles apart
[2:06:37] all of our life the Holy Spirit would
[2:06:39] have to do something that would make you
[2:06:41] know that the presence of his being is
[2:06:44] here then it would make you have more
[2:06:46] confidence that I told you the truth
[2:06:50] Church of the Living God then the
[2:06:52] presence of the Lord is coming into the
[2:06:54] church and is giving you Faith to
[2:06:57] believe the words you're hearing and is
[2:06:59] end doing you with a knowledge of his
[2:07:01] presence that you cannot hide nothing
[2:07:03] from
[2:07:07] him now I'm closing on
[2:07:09] this the holy spirit moves out on the
[2:07:12] building and speaks to whomever he will
[2:07:14] speak see that's Sovereign and then that
[2:07:16] brings the knowledge because it's a
[2:07:19] promise of God and that brings the
[2:07:21] knowledge of God's Sovereign and also
[2:07:24] brings his presence down among us we
[2:07:27] should see it and
[2:07:32] rejoice we should see
[2:07:37] it and rejoice he said you say well I
[2:07:40] was crippled in my hand I was there last
[2:07:42] night I didn't get any better that don't
[2:07:45] have nothing to do with it to you it's
[2:07:47] already f finished you're not looking at
[2:07:50] your hand then you're looking at the
[2:07:54] promise and therefore you can't say well
[2:07:56] brother so and so didn't pray the prayer
[2:07:58] of faith or so and so it's the presence
[2:08:01] of the Lord that gave you the faith you
[2:08:03] see that he sent his word and healed
[2:08:06] them listen we believe he sent his word
[2:08:08] and healed I believe tonight he sent his

[2:21:40] God no I ain't dancing cuz somebody told
[2:21:43] me to I'm dancing cuz there's something
[2:21:45] in my

[2:22:13] your hand
[2:22:14] there If He Did It Before
[2:22:18] he can do it
[2:22:20] again the other day I was over Third
[2:22:22] Church preaching along these lines right
[2:22:24] here and I was just talking about the
[2:22:26] faith of God and the presence of God and
[2:22:29] I while I was preaching Brother Sam I
[2:22:31] remembered a testimony of sister shica I
[2:22:33] think it was in Louisiana at the
[2:22:34] meetings I believe brother Wayne was
[2:22:36] preaching and you had a a shoulder
[2:22:38] problem or something and the Lord healed
[2:22:40] you of it and I just told that testimony
[2:22:42] I just told it and kept on preaching I
[2:22:44] didn't know that when I told that she
[2:22:45] was sitting there right with the another
[2:22:47] shoulder injury but the next day I
[2:22:49] believe it was her sometime she goes to
[2:22:51] the doctor with a reinjured shoulder and
[2:22:53] the doctor says there's nothing wrong
[2:22:55] with it just a little bit of scar tissue
[2:22:57] it's going to be
[2:23:00] okay if he did it before he can do it
[2:23:05] again she was endued with the knowledge
[2:23:08] of the presence of Jesus Christ as a
[2:23:11] Healer as an atonement as a deliverer
[2:23:14] and because the devil fed her again she
[2:23:16] didn't back up she stood there and said
[2:23:18] if God healed me once his presence can
[2:23:20] do it again what Jesus was is what his
[2:23:23] presence is House of Hell give way to
[2:23:25] the presence of Jesus Christ May ever
[2:23:28] bone be broken of the devil and may

[3:41:05] Lord praise the
[3:41:09] Lord there's one thing
[3:41:13] that we always want to
[3:41:16] do is when the Lord
[3:41:19] comes we don't ever want to just be in a
[3:41:22] hurry to walk
[3:41:25] out without giving him thank
[3:41:28] you did you know that that's one of the
[3:41:31] signs of his
[3:41:33] coming that this
[3:41:35] generation would be a thankless
[3:41:38] generation what the Bible says
[3:41:41] that in the last days there would be no
[3:41:44] thanks
[3:41:46] thankfulness so when God does anything
[3:41:48] for
[3:41:51] us always
[3:41:55] stop don't ever be in a hurry if the
[3:41:58] Lord does something for you just stop
[3:42:01] right there he he came by your way and
[3:42:03] he done something special for you
