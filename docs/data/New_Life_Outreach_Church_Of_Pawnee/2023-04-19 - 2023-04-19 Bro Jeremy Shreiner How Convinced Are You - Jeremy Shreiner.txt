matter what family whatever home I walk into you're facing trials troubles battles struggles whatever it may be and a lot of times Satan has a tendency to to weaken us down it's a series that I've been on for a long time I told the church brother Jason Jackson's I said it's hard to get 10 sermons into into two I gotta fit them into one tonight don't worry about it I'm just kidding I'm not gonna go that route but there's no matter what it is Our Testimony is that we're going to see a victory and if you know this song I want you to sing it with us I don't want to just sing it in front of you I want you to welcome the victory yourself and I know you've been standing but I kind of like you to stand with me and if you know it just sing it along it's called see a victory if you have it but we'll just try a weapon may be formed but it won't prosper when the Darkness Falls it won't Prevail cause the God I serve knows only how to try [Music] God will never fail sing it from your heart now my God oh my God we'll never fail I'm gonna see a victory I'm gonna see a victory for the battle belongs to hello I'm gonna see a victory I'm gonna see a victory for The Battle Belongs to Lord and

enemy meant for evil and you turn it for good you turn in foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] victory [Music] for The Battle Belongs to [Music] foreign amen Hallelujah well for the sake of time we'll go ahead and jump right in this tonight while you're standing we'll turn to Revelation chapter 12. amen we just love the Lord with all of our heart and Trust tonight that we can say something that'll be a help to you along the way there's just been a lot of burdens you know the ministry understands this just a lot of burdens throughout the message and a lot of things that have been going on and and you just you see what Satan's trying to do and we don't want to give the enemy any Glory by any means and but I think that we need to know what he's trying to do we shouldn't whistle through a graveyard and just think that we're going to come out okay we should be prepared for the enemy and so tonight we just want to take this thought just simply how convinced are you now I know you're I know your message people tonight and I understand that I'm speaking to message people tonight so let's just take this verse 3 Revelation 12 3 it says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and as tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragons stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born amen let's just pray together Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you this evening Lord we thank you for this assembly father here in Pawnee Lord and the ministry father and the helps and each person that is here Lord I believe I heard that many are out of town Lord maybe sick or going to certain circumstances of life that they've had to deal with Lord of pray for comfort during those times but Lord we're here tonight Lord and each and every one that has made it through these doors you know who they are you know the need in their life father I can't meet that need there's no man that can stand behind this sacred desk and meet any needs it takes you so father I Surrender my my mind my thoughts to you now and ask that you are just calm the nerves father and that you would begin to speak father directly to the heart we surrender ourselves to you now in Jesus precious name we ask you amen God bless you can be seated tonight there we go brother Branham said in the greatest battle ever fought he said this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his and his angels it first started her the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of the Earth or Out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy or Satan had come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since so what is it that we find as we try to bring all of these thoughts in in my heart and my mind to to a central location tonight what is it that we find from the beginning to now that brings the ministry what is what is it the greatest thing that we should be concerned about on the hour that we're living in now I know that you're here tonight and I know that you've come to church and you've and you've worshiped God but there's been a lot of worshipers there's been a lot of church members there's been a lot of message people that have showed up to church or ministered the gospel or or have performed duties or have been sheep of this message if you would but how many people are sticking with it and our thought as we deal with this has how convinced are you really in this message and but what is the passion or what is the The Burning Desire that we feel that is happening today enough that it was even preached with great Passion from pastors and evangelists it is the power of deception and what deception is this that we're dealing with and again bear with me I understand that I'm speaking to message people tonight and so I I know that we have to and I dealt with this at home and and even in other places and I know that we have to deal with worldlyism and how it creeps into the home and how it could be creeping into the church but I really want you to look at this tonight and I want you to understand that it's not worldlyism that's going to try to attract the bride it's not worldlyism so much that's going to try to attract the uh the church member if you would but the Bible tells us of such a great deception that would be so close that if it could it could deceive the very elect and worldlyism is not going to deceive the elect you're not going to be caught off guard by the things of the world but there's something that will try to creep into a church a good church of a church of good people and try to weaken the body so much that even Jesus himself in Matthew 24 4 said and Jesus said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name so he's not saying many is going to come in this name or that name I mean he's going to come in the name of worldlyism or these things but he said he's going to come in my name and saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so the deception of the age was the deception that we have to be concerned about that we have to be concerned about now is that we have a group of people that think they're right and can't accept help brother Branham said in the laodicean church age he says it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire so they're constantly by the window they're looking for something else they're looking for something because there's one place where brother Branham talked about him forgive me I don't have a word for word but I'll give it to you later if I can where he's talking about are people that now are not satisfied enough with the word of God they're not satisfied with what God can do in their midst and so they're constantly looking for other things they're looking for all of these things and he says there's no peace saith my God to the wicked he says they are miserable now I might not be talking to you tonight you might be completely on fire this evening and that's okay but just bear with me all right and and pray that we don't find ourselves in this condition but we also succumb to the position where we say God I want to make sure that I don't find myself getting to that position he says he says that there are they are miserable that means that they are objects to be pitied you know you know the message he said pity they scorn pity they are full of pride so what do we have to look at because we know that Satan is trying to be an impersonation of God that's why you can't look at someone and see that they have an emotion and say that they have the Holy Spirit the Bible says you know them by their fruits and I Know It talked about the the false prophets and things but we can take that and know them by their fruits that is that is more than just listen it's both sides it's more than just an emotion but it's also more than just a legalism spirit that you can say well I don't I don't have this and I don't do these things in my home and and and listen there's a group of people that stood before Jesus and they claimed all of their legalism and missed the life but then we have to be careful on the other side that we bring before our God our actions and all of the things that we do in church and all the things that we do and we're actually missing the word that is being opened let's come back to the middle of the road and say God we need the word and the life put together so that we can survive this journey so we know that Satan is trying to impersonate God so he's not going to attract you with worldly things now listen I understand that every now and then you're going to be hit with things that's not what I'm saying but would you allow me to go into this Avenue so we know that he is trying to impersonate what God is trying to do today now he couldn't do it before but now that there's an open book you cannot just look and say well because they believe in serpent seed or because they believe uh in a prophet that their Rapture material listen I can stand behind this pulpit and preach the word of God and call fire from heaven and I can prime a prayer line and there can be a mighty move of God and I can split hell wide open amen hallelujah I'm going to just keep preaching anyhow is that all right notice what we say we know Satan is an impersonation so second Corinthians 11 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers what does he say transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ he says and don't Marvel about this for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore listen carefully it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness notice brother he did not just say unrighteousness but he said Ministers of righteousness what does this saying we've got to be careful that we're not following just Ministries listen we've got to be careful that we're not just bowing to an image we wanted we weren't called to bow to an image but that image that God gave us that Prophet that God gave us called us to look to the great one oh my Hallelujah so so therefore it is no great thing that his ministers be transformed as Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works now I I I don't have this down here but we're just going to go this route anyways because God says so you think about what we find in in the ranks that we're living in in the ranks of religion itself you you think well I can discern what's going on really can you let's just think about it for a moment let's just go let's just go but right before the cross if you would let's go on a journey to the room where the disciples were together and they said in this room with Jesus and I and I like to paint this picture by the window of of this moment to where they were away from the crowds they didn't have to put on a front they were they were with the master they were at peace they were sitting around a table they were having communion with Jesus and in this part of communion Satan was still on the move oh man I'm Alive come on let's be real with this now there was nobody there come on there was no worldlyism there oh but we'll brother Jeremy we know about Judas you know on this side of the story you know now that Judas was a son of perdition but they didn't know then because the Bible tells us that Judas had a Ministry like all of them Judas had a Ministry that was brother Branham even said himself that he it was not inferior nor nor devilish he had a Ministry just like them oh yeah but we can discern listen to all of those men sat there and let's talk about the revealing of the word in a service so we find where Jesus talks to these uh to his his disciples come on we're having a church service right and he's talking to his disciples and and he's saying you know tonight uh someone is going to betray me well naturally if you were in a church service and brother Wendell gets up here and says tonight somebody's going to do something everyone's going to be like who if you're in your right mind well who's going to portray you there's no worldlyism here there's no outside person these are all of our brothers these are the ones that have cast out demons have had great conventions who is this going to be now Jesus gave an answer he said to one that I'm going to dip the SOP and give it to or basically give him the bread that's the one and notice so Jesus spoke the word this is how it's going to be and he fulfilled it he gave it to Judas and basically said go do what you must do and Judas took that stop and he got up and he left and if you read the Bible they said well Judas must be going to do something good look it up because he carries the bag wait a minute wait Jesus they asked they asked the question at least we're at church they asked the question who was it Jesus spoke it Vindicated it it came to pass and they said well it sure still can be him and you talk about discernment brothers and sisters what I'm talking about is we have to be careful because it was Vindicated to them not only brother Wendell did they not see it and they still said it can't be him then they begin to quell about who was going to be the best I'm going to move on now I'm just trying to be real with you it's deception that we got to worry about we've got to worry about it because it came up not from the outside it came from within then uh then Satan entered into a message believer again hey stop with your after the fact prophecies you know now we're who he is but you didn't know then all right so we find this deception that's in the land today why is it because Satan's trying to get to the message people he's trying to get to the Bride of Jesus Christ and he knows that he's not going to get you with the things of the world so we find the Bible everything that God had and God was for him Satan impersonated notice Revelation 5 5 and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof that's the lion the tribe of Judah right notice the impersonation first Peter 5 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour as a roaring lion okay uh you you're a lion I'm going to be as a roaring lion Jesus said well now Jesus didn't I mean the word of God didn't just say well just forget about it no I said be sober be vigilant because he's there to try to bring listen and that impersonation could be so close to the truth that you'll fall for it if you're not sold out to God that's why I'm asking how convinced really are you in this message because those disciples said with Jesus even one of them said I will not now I know while they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's many today that claim it but don't have the life you can't say that you have the Holy Ghost by just saying you believe God sent a prophet just like you can't say you have the Holy Ghost just because you've spoken another language there's a life that follows it oh my notice that so there's the impersonation notice Revelation 19 11. and I saw heaven opened up and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and righteousness he does judge and make war notice what that was we know who that is I'm just going to for the sake of time verse 13 and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name was called the word of God so here we see God himself coming on a white horse and then we see the impersonation Revelation 6 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse impersonation you say well we know listen the prophet of God until it was revealed to him saw the same thing come on it's deception so close to the truth and so we see that it was so close that even the prophet had to have his eyes open to it I'm so glad for our prophet I'm so glad that we had a prophet that was humble enough to say I was wrong I needed it open to me take that how you will think about the true prophet of God Amos 3 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets is not not the word so God has a plan he's going to speak through His prophets Satan says all right I got something for you too so then we had to have a warning in Matthew 7 15 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing not worldly clothing clothing that means they're religious people that means they go to church every time they can you got to beware of them though but inwardly they are rabbeting wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns and or figs of thistles so we see the true prophets and then the false prophets and then God gives us a true Ministry Ephesians 4 11 right 11 and 12. I'm just gonna you know what that is I'm not gonna I'm just going to try to hurry up wait I'm trying I really am true Ministries okay I'm going to read it anyhow because some people don't like it and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers it's still in the Bible for the perfecting of the Saints not me yes it is you if you are a saint if you're not a saint then of course it ain't you you don't have to worry about it for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and then Satan says I got one for you second Timothy 4 2 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come if this ain't the time when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto Fable Satan says I got something for you too listen I just read it if Satan transformed himself into an angel of Light and he has Ministers of righteousness how much more should we be careful that we do not get caught up in a movement I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm not talking about a move of God because listen there ain't nothing like a move of God that's been going on and Satan recognizes that and he's trying to capitalize on that and he's catching people you see wherever God is and has a move Satan follows suit with his own we find this in Christ the mystery and he says and here is Lucifer at his job again today and remember the Antichrist is not communism he said the Antichrist is so close to the real thing till it deceived the very elect if it was possible Jesus said in Matthew 24 if they're the elected if it was possible Lucifer again Lucifer again is breaking God's unity in Man by his limiting the word of God to his reasonings when he thinks oh my what he thinks that's right and what he thinks he breaks the word of God and the same thing he did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said you by your Traditions has made the word of God of no effect so you know this right you see this so what does the bible warn us of in second Peter chapter 3 verse 17 it says ye therefore beloved scene you know these things before beware well I'm a message believer I got to worry about it guard that word beware is guard lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from notice brother when you notice what it says your own steadfastness come on he's speaking to message people because you're steadfast you're you're solid in something but he says if you're not on guard come on if you're not staying where you should be if you come on you can get religious in yourself if you want to or you can lean it upon a single emotion or you can come back to the word of God and say Lord Give Me Your word open it to me give me all of myself give me out of my religion and give me guide me into that so he says call from that notice notice Colossians 2 8 says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ again that word beware Gorge yourself why because there's there's something that's trying to spoil you now that word spoil now it commonly means to corrupt or to cause Decay and perish as fruit is spoiled by keeping too long but if we look at that Greek here it's used to mean to spoil in the sense of plunder and rob you as in plunder during war taken in war that means the meaning is to take heed lest anyone plunder or Rob you of your faith and your hope because these false teachers would strip them of their Faith and Hope as an invading Army would rob a country that was all a country of all that was valuable you see the enemy wants to come in and he wants to rob you of your joy and he wants to rob you of your faith and he wants to rob you of everything that's valuable foreign what you have sitting next to you is a value but it's not the most valuable thing I know that's hard to take but my wife understands that the the person across the church is valuable but it's not the most valuable thing the car that you drive the job that you have the house that you have yes they have some value but it's not what's that's not what really Satan is after he's after your soul come on now just just bear with me so close so close so close that it could deceive you if you allow it to okay notice brother Branham and Satan's Eden says the God of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church as the church he says and they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it I yeah think about it he said oh you say wait a minute we preach the word and he capitalized word he said wait a minute we preached the word he says look back here at my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word to Eve I think you know the Bible God hath said it's that misconstruating part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know that what Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that God gave for this day then that was applied to another age well that's all that's just all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it which leads us to the major question tonight how convinced really are you because the first scripture we read we talked about something that occurred if Satan influenced a third of the angels from a place of complete perfection almost slow down for a minute if he influenced a third of perfection let's go even further if he influenced a perfect creation in the garden stop there for a minute before you get all spiritual on me oh she was just a she was at the byproduct come on perfect creation anything God does is perfect so get your if he influenced so let's talk about a glorious place a place of perfection and Eden if he influenced all of these things how convinced are you in his Eden that you can actually stand because that word convinced is completely certain about something now I know that there's legalism in the message I get that where people are completely convinced that their legalism will get him there and I know that there's that there's people that that hold to emotion and believe that emotion is exactly what's going to get him there that's not what it's all about and you have to know that I'm not speaking against one or the other I'm just trying to bring it to a balance because you come to my church we believe in it all we believe in the word of God we believe in the gifts of the holy spirit active in the church we believe in all of these things listen we I just came from a church service in Arkansas where we had Miracle after Miracle happen in a prayer line I believe in these things but what are we going to do after these things Satan sees it and we begin to draw only towards those things if we're not careful and we begin to hold to our the things that we don't do and say because I don't do these things I'm going to make a Rapture and then we come to the other side of the world because I ran around the church one time that's going to do it that's what Satan wants you to think but know you've got to come back to the word of God and be born again be filled with the spirit to where the house of God becomes the most important thing to where reading the word of God is more than just legalism but it's a love letter listen we got to come back to this being a love letter I want to fall in love with Jesus ask yourself the question right now do I love him more than anything else man I just felt that come in do I love him more than anything else do I love him more than my spouse do I love her more than my children do I love him more than my job do I love him more than my car oh God I want to love you more than anything else you got to ask yourself the question and you got to be honest there's got to be conviction conviction is not just in the mind because Christianity is not a convenient religion you've been lied to if you've been told that getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost would make everything hunky-dory I know you haven't been told that here you've been lied to that being born again would fix all of your problems you've been lied to if you've been told getting married will fix a problem you've been lied to if you've been told getting more money we'll fix a problem and you I'm gonna go back to the spiritual side you've been lied to by if if that's what you feel because when you truly get born again listen the target you thought you had been exploded Satan will do whatever he can to stop you he'll try to get the ministry by getting to the wife he'll try to get to this one by getting to the husband he'll try to get to the children by getting to the mom or the dad he'll try to get to the mom or dad by getting to the children he'll get to the church by coming up amongst the church well let's just stop for a minute and let's let's look at a believer Genesis 25 29 he was a believer we're talking about Esau see again let's let's throw away our future tense prophecies and all the things that we know now because here was a man that was born what the birthright is his let's just read it together Genesis 25 29 I'll give you a second to turn there more than likely to give myself a second to drink Hallelujah so notice what he says or what the Bible says here in Jacob sawed pottage if you don't know what that means it means he was cooking wow sinful he was cooking food haniso came from the field and he was faint that's probably more faint than what my daughter says when she's starving but listen brother Merle this guy was just hungry he was so hungry that he thought he was going to die and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee I mean you're my brother come on help a brother out feed me I pray thee with the same red pottage for I am faint therefore his name was called Edom and Jacob said while this escalated quickly tell me this day thy Birthright what a church service and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what profit me shall this church even have for me I'm at the point about what point what point is even reading the Bible anymore what point is getting filled with the Holy Ghost anymore I've seen people speak in tongues and go curse the next day what's point and seeking the gifts anymore and Esau said behold I am at the point of die what prophet out of this birth Roger me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave he saw bread and pottage of lentils and did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way and Esau despised his Birthright now let's you know Esau still had cattle he still had land in fact he still caused fear to Jacob but he devalued the spiritual seed line in our day we could say he devalued the token it's not important help me Lord can I just say this he it what was it it was Hunger that caused Esau to devalue the birthright it was an adultery it wasn't murder are you with me it wasn't cursing somebody out it was simply hunger something that is natural brother Wendell that caused him to say what's the point I'm gonna let that sink in you see Satan is not so much just gonna come at you with a box or music or a magazine sometimes he's just going to use life to cause you to devalue the importance of God and his word he'll cause you to devalue uh your prayer time he'll cause you to devalue the Holy Ghost because man the Holy Ghost is nothing but emotion that's not what it is but listen if you get born again and you get filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit you get so excited something's going to happen listen I've seen people get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and just literally just weep they didn't shout they didn't run the aisles but they just wept they never wept before and I've seen a life that follows it I've seen people get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God's power just move and they just run around the church and their life lived proved it I want to bring this home to you tonight how convinced are you how convinced with Esau in his Birthright that's simply hunger caused him to say it's not worth it what did it it wasn't a I'm going to drive this home it wasn't a major sin that we would call it it was Hunger that's why we've got to be careful that we don't look at our circumstance we have allowed circumstances to devalue the importance of God we've allowed circumstances to devalue the importance of the house of God to devalue the importance of a prayer life to devalue the importance of coming and worshiping God with all of our heart I'm not saying that we we have things that we've got to do that's not what I'm saying I'm just saying God help us help us as message people not to devalue the importance of worship to devalue the importance of listening to the word of God and being hungry for the word of God listen I don't just want you to sit here tonight and look at me or for the windowless preaching or any brother that's preaching I want you to look at the word of God I would just say I'm hungry for the word of God to where the things of this world just natural things will pull you away you don't know where Satan might use one of your best friends to grab your attention and to cause you to devalue simple life things the enemy like I said doesn't always use worldly things but he'll use life to entice you to just give up nobody understands nobody understands what I'm going through nobody understands my heart nobody understands it's it's a natural desire it doesn't matter it might be a natural desire but if it pulls you away from the almighty God then rebuke it God has something for you something listen I don't want it to entice me I don't want I don't want to get caught up in in groups and and what you have to do it a certain way listen that's enticing to Ministries I don't want to be caught up in all that I used to hear my my grandpa used to savor the window years ago he said I will never join a camp well bummer I guess I can't go to a youth camp that's not what he meant he was just talking about it come to a point in time if you're not careful well Satan will try to entice you with certain Ministries that'll say you have to be a part of us or you're not part of anything and I'm not saying that that's in the message but if we're not careful it could be because Satan's trying to draw us from what the last soul if he can get us caught up and and fighting in bickering and so busy and so full of life that we can't get back on our knees and say God I just need a touch from you listen I know you're good people I know you love the Lord but sometimes it just doesn't hurt to say God I just need a little more well I'm just not an emotional person well just let me punch you in the face once we'll find out how emotional you are sometimes we just say God and pray let's just let me be me for a minute brother I know I gotta I gotta come to God and say Lord I just need some more I could preach a sermon it doesn't matter I just need more of you I need my time well I'm a great minister of the Gospel so a donkey helped one time I don't really see that donkey's I don't see if there's any glory for that donkey because God used him to get somebody's attention so what good am I could be no better than a donkey I said God I need a touch from you I need my life so filled and so intertwined in your presence where I'm not enticed by listen I'm not just I'm not talking about worldlyism right now I don't want to be enticed by religious Spirits I don't want to be enticed by coming to the house of God and thinking that because I've preached a sermon or thinking because I've I've sung a song or that I've played music or that I've come here every time that it's enough for me I want to be so convinced that when those Winds of doctrines try to come through and those religious Spirits try to come through it catches my attention and I say God I don't want that in my life I just want another touch from you something has to influence or motivate us there has to be something an internal conviction and it has to be more than a mental conception Hallelujah has to be more than a mental conception because I'm going to tell you you're not convinced by legalism and you're not convinced by emotionalism but it comes back to a back of the desert experience with God to where you're born again and you're done listen were the things of the world and all of life that's trying to drag you what was listen let's just stop for a minute and let's look at what was the pressure of this age because you really look at the pressure of every age and we talked about it they were sauna Sunder you know they were fed to the lions that was the pressures those age but what did Jesus what did he say the pressures of this age was he said it was going to be the age where the word of God would go forth but the cares of this life would squeeze it out of you you could be here tonight you can be at every service but if we're not careful we could allow the cares of life hunger come on Esau hunger simple things that's not a part of the world to squeeze the whole life out of us it's what we've got to watch in this day I need to go back sometimes you got to go back well I'm I'm a message believer I don't need to go back to an Old-Fashioned altar listen I gotta go back I've got to go back to an Old-Fashioned altar sometimes it happens in a service sometimes it happens before service sometimes I walk around the church before a service and I just cry out to God and I go and I lay before him listen you have to do the same thing you have to find your time with God where it's got to be more than just religion listen I know you're a good people but don't let it become just religion it's got to be some life where's the life back up where's the life in your eyes I can see in your eyes and I can see in some of you there's no life I say God give the life back [Applause] because yes trials are here you can't do nothing about it they're here to stay pain is here you can't do nothing about it it's going to be here until we go home hurt is here heard is here it's a big thing in churches hurt people hurt people it's what happens it's talking with someone here the other day and just trying to help him out encourage them a little bit and just talking about a family situation where they thought perhaps someone didn't love them it was a part of the family just because of the difficulty that they were going through at that time and and I was like wait a minute this person would die for you they would give their life for you do you believe that I absolutely believe that then why are you wondering if they love you it's just the way I'm being treated right now just the circumstance of the situation yeah but they would die for you they would give their life for you yes absolutely I said that's the way family is it's kind of a stupid thing forgive me but family will fight for one another love one another we'll we'll put up for one another but they're also the first ones that'll fight one another I know that's none of y'all but it is the truth come on you Brothers you you a brother and you're a brother is your other brother's not here but somewhere along the way y'all probably had a little spat no just a little bit brother Wendell it's a little bit more than a little bit did y'all did y'all hate one another you probably thought it and said it a couple times but you would do whatever you could for one another you would fight for one another but because we're family we're close and it's the first one that will explode on again I know some of y'all are perfect and you never have that problem you husbands and wives are just great but just come to Texas for a moment my church is going to hate me now it's the truth and Satan wants to get among the church a wonderful I didn't have this quote put down but I believe I read it back at brother Jason's where God will allow things to come into a church he will allow sickness you can look it up for yourself he will allow he will allow uh just something to arise he'll allow can I just put it this way spats to happen well I don't want to go to this church anymore it's going to be anywhere you go to see what you will do when troubles arise do you have one another's back just yeah sorry brother Wendell oh this is the next part right here I have yes the pressure is on I'm feeling it now the pressure is on the pressure is here Satan is rising up and he is listen I'm going to tell you he is here and he's trying he's working at the minds of the young people and he's working at the minds of the dads and he's working at the minds of the moms he's working at the minds of the grandparents he's working at every mind that he can and he's trying to attract you and weaken you notice what the Bible said he did weaken the Nations that's his goals to come into a church and to weaken a body when you have a weak immune system your body will catch brother Brandon even said it your body will catch a cold just like that or the weak immune system and what does life do boom boom boom hit after hit problem after problem Satan trying to weaken that immune system and he went begins to weaken that a spiritual immune system there's signs and I don't have them all wrote down but they're signs of of a weak immune system one of the signs of a weak immune system is that you're quick to catch colds okay natural spiritual weak immune system you're quick to catch things another sign of a weak immune system is that uh your wounds don't heal very well if you're spiritually weak your wounds they they kind of they don't heal like they should oh let this oh God help us to let this sink in spiritually it everything is just exploded and everything is exposed where our weak immune system and we lose strength listen what has been going on after this disease I ain't never seen so many people more sick than I ever have before it now however you want to spin it that's fine I'm not here to debate with you about that I just know it's a stupid devil but what it has done is it has weakened the bodies and and people and I'm a vitamin taker like I've never thought I'd be I became the old vitamin taker I didn't know it I didn't come out with a cane hey you've got a long way to never mind I Hallelujah anyhow listen I I was the I'm the vitamin taker why because I don't want none of that junk yeah ain't nobody got time for that and it's like no matter what you try it's there yeah and before you know it this one has it and everyone can sanitize you can come in in a sanitized shower and you'll get it it's the age and I want you to catch that if you see it naturally what do you think's happen spiritually that's why we've got to be prayed up that's why we don't have to pray anymore because we've at the opening of the word who told you that it's a lie prayer is not just praying to get out of something prayer is a conversation with the one that you love Hallelujah yes the pressure's on many are bowing and yes the God of this age is pressing but my God who is rich in Mercy Ephesians 2 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great lover with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved notice and raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you want to know how you're going to make it through Satan's Eden is by not being a part of it because he said he's going to raise you and sit you in Heavenly places that means listen I'm in this world but I'm not of it why because I have been raised into a different Realm I'm not going to be bothered by circumstances anymore circumstances can't rule me life can't rule me you say I'm starving God knows you he knows what you quit trying to fix it yourself give it to God I might be in this world but I'm not of it I'm going to come to a close now the three Hebrew children were so convinced that they face that fiery furnace not only did they face it they walked in listen they they did not know fully what was going to happen it doesn't matter what happens we know that we're gods Daniel was convinced enough to face the Lions Peter was convinced enough to hang upside down catch says Stephen was convinced enough to pray for his executioners as they stoned him what did Brother Branham say would enter perfect hey I appreciate the knowledge that you have I appreciate the the gifts and I appreciate all of the things and the missions and but if you don't have perfect love yes what good is everything else you see I don't want to be influenced by a religious spirit tonight I don't want to walk away tonight brother Wendell and say hi preached the sermon I did my part walk away and not worry about anything that's not what life's about see I learned my lesson as a young Minister I used to wonder why after I would preach get in that anointing why after I was done why it would be such a hard fall maybe none of you ministers ever never felt that there's always a drop that's just the way it goes we don't live in that realm right by the window we just don't but it shouldn't be God began to deal with me it shouldn't be such a hard fall from a sermon and I begin to realize that was my Telltale sign that something was not right in my life because God would use me because I was called into the ministry and I happen to be the one brother Wendell that God would use that night and there would be Miracles and God would move in a mighty way and he would use me and then after the service I would leave and I would hit my bed at night and I would have such a my wife remembers that I'd have such a hard fall and it would almost bring me into a depression and I thought at first well that that just must mean it that that's just what the anointing does that's not what it was brother Wendell it was because I wasn't where I should be and so I believe that all of us God wants to give if you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit there should be warning signs in our life something that should be a radar something you see or you could be those that were uh on Pearl Harbor who were so caught up with the cares of life that when the warning signs were there and they seen the blips on the radar that they just said it was something else and they did not pay attention and many lost their lives because they didn't take the early warning system you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not just something that's there to use only when you need it but it's also a warning system to let you know when you're getting a little cold when you should when you're not where you should be it's not just because you made a good religious decision or you made a good decision that you thought was a good religious thing it's not all about those things but it's about God where should I be spiritually with you let me just tell you anything that God wants you to do should never take you away from his presence and if you listen to that and you're away from his presence and it was a different spirit that led you there and I've been in that condition before I know what it's like I speak from experience that there's got to be an early warning system something to let us know I'm cold listen I'm at church I made it to church I did what I needed to do I preached I sung I led songs I played music I played the drums and did whatever I needed to do but every time I would leave the fall would be so hard something was wrong somewhere but I'm so glad that God placed something inside of my heart that said you you're not going to go you see the by his word says he's not going to lose a one you know some of you know it if you knew my life you'd be why in the world is he even preaching such a horrible person I wouldn't listen we're not here to outdo one another's sins we all could sit here and be the same way but we all have done at least something that we don't deserve to be in the position that we're in now so what gives us the right to look at one another and say yours is worse or mine's worse we've all done something that is in need of the grace of God so guess what that means we're all in the same place right now we're all in Grace but God who is rich in Mercy can you bow your heads don't be influenced by the God of this world and again I'm not trying to be repetitious I'm not talking about you being influenced by worldly things I'm simply saying religion is not enough if it was enough then what was the point of the open book what was the point of 1963 what's the point of the upper room experience when those men that stood before Jesus and he said you have your father the devil and they brought for him we're all aware of Abraham where of this where of that they brought him all kinds of legalism they brought him all kinds of of experience and brought him all kinds of letter but they didn't have the life listen we're message people we believe God sent a prophet We Believe that we believe in the gifts of the holy spirit we believe in the opening of the book we believe the word of God revealed but where we're sitting right now can we all just come to a place right where you're at humbly before God say Lord do I do I just need do I just need a touch from you tonight I don't want to be pulled aside by some life thing listen life's coming at you hard life's coming at you fast you've been through some struggles and some trials I get it I get it it's tough It's hard and you're you're some of you are just being beat and beat and your mind is broken and you've been and and you're and you're battered and you're scarred I get it I'm with you I see them I see your eyes I see your I see you that there tonight but I want you to know in this simple Wednesday night service presence of God is here and I'm not just trying to work you up to anything and I go back to this it seems like everywhere I preach for the window I I feel as if God says the same thing to me to say to you do you trust me do you trust me enough to let go of the past enough to let go of the future enough to let go of life and Trust God's plan enough to say Lord I don't care what happens I don't care what's going on all I want is you right now how long has it been since you've been behind the veil I didn't say you weren't a good person see Satan's beating up on your mind I didn't say that you listen I didn't say you're on your road to hell I just asked when was the last time you went behind the veil because listen when you get behind the veil a lot of things become more clear a lot of decisions become more clear and you get some answers I've given you some time to let the Holy Spirit now move through this building and now I'm gonna just ask a leap of faith listen I don't want you to come forward because I can't do anything for you unless you really want me to agree with faith with you but if you want to just come stand up here and you want to say Lord here am I just be honest please don't be afraid of anyone around you we might be the strongest Satan is going to it doesn't matter what we are it's Lord I just need a touch from you tonight I'm not talking about a touch of healing of the natural body but I need a spiritual why is fear here I rebuke fear in the name of Jesus fear you're a liar I just need a touch from you what is that it's a person that loves God so much it says God surely there's more for me surely there's more for me I I don't I don't want to be going through like this I I don't long for the world I'm not Desiring the world I'm not Desiring to leave the message I'm not Desiring those things not one bit but God I just want another touch hold me in your arms Lord Surround Me With Your Love Lord I know I don't deserve in there but I just want to touch Lord bring the joy back in my life bring the joy of the Holy Spirit back bring the joy of church back bring the joy of service back bring the joy of family back bring it back lord I don't want to leave this place that way anymore I'm convinced that this is my life but I've gone a little cold maybe there's maybe there's some warning signs what here am I [Music] know every heart see those that have come Lord Lord I don't know their names father I just know God I know that you're calling I rebuke that religious demon that's trying so hard to clamp its its claws on the minds of people you have no hold on their life oh God release him I pray in the name of Jesus let him see the light of day tonight Lord let them see Lord there's been some love lost let them see Lord that they've there's been some Joy lost let him see Lord how much you care for them [Music] how much you love them you loved them enough to hang on a cross to give him hope I want to tell you tonight he loved you enough to give you a second chance he loved you enough to draw you once more do you know that Draw Me Lord there's two different ones you just play what everyone comes your own oh draw me Lord [Music] see I'm not expecting some big great big thing tonight I do feel that this is just a there's such a low such a deep presence here tonight why because he loves you so much every one of you that have come forth I want you to know that God loves you so much he cares for he sees your faith he sees your desire and he's the one drawing you listen he could still be drawing someone else but we're so clouded by life or so clouded by what others will think but I say Lord I just need you now listen right now if you were asked would you be willing to forsake all would you be willing to come and say I forsake all I forsake all the things because I want you more than anything else I want you more than my spouse I want you more than my child I want you more than a boyfriend a girlfriend I want you more than a job I want you more than a house Lord if I have to live on the streets Lord if I Whatever It Is God I want you more than anything else I'm tired of devaluing this life I'm tired of devaluing the Holy Spirit I just want to be back in that presence again honest with God would you be our lord Jesus you see everyone that has come forward Lord young

bride if there's a time this is not the time to quit praying to quit reading the Bible to quit listening to the message to to this is not the time to to look out here and there and everywhere else we've had a voice saying Now's the Time to dig in deeper than you've ever dug in can you say Amen now those old those old voices are out there they've always been there they were there in Jesus time
