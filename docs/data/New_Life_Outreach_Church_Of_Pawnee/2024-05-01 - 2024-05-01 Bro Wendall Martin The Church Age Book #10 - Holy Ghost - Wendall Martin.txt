we uh we'll read a little bit tonight that that can only come that can only come from the genetics of God that that desire to please him and that desire for more of him that can only come from something that was predestinated on the inside of you and I'm so thankful amen for the predestinated seat of God within us that is guiding us and and leading us amen through this life praise the Lord amen well it's good to see everyone here in the house of the Lord and and um it's good to be back home we sure we sure have missed uh uh being uh being here had a had a tremendous meeting there at brother Sha's and and uh I tell you what the word this year was just so rich and and uh such a wonderful presence of the Lord that was there through throughout the meeting and so we're sure thankful for that here tonight to see hungry hearts that want more of him and you know we have that hunger here and uh I guess there was around a thousand of them over there and and they all express the same the same kind of hunger that you have amen for more of the Lord and so we're sure thankful for that it's um it's good to see I I I guess Juniper was was uh here this week last weekend but uh uh I'm glad to see her in church here this morning and or this [Applause] evening might not be your first church service but this is going to be our first church service hearing me amen and uh and so we're sure glad we're sure glad to uh to see sister Stephanie and and the baby and sure do sure do love uh sister Stephanie and U that's such a beautiful beautiful baby praise the lord well um let's let's go ahead and and get into the scripture here tonight um and for our our scripture reading we're going to um we're going to look here at um amen uh we're going to Revelations the the um 2 chapter and uh the 11th verse and U and then we're going to get right on into uh the church age book we're going to be starting there at at 139 but we're just going to read the one verse there it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches now I like that he he that has an ear now there's there's I guess everyone I've ever ran into has at least got one ear but amen this is not what he's talking about he that is been built to hear the things of the Lord amen so he that hath an ear spiritual ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your many blessings that you have given us thank you Lord for the presence of your holy spirit that we feel here tonight Lord for your anointing that is that is uh here in the service thank you Lord for uh our our baby back there father and and uh giving strength and and and uh uh recovery and healing to to Mom Lord we just thank you for for being there with the Lancaster family Lord where you see those that are that are traveling today Lord to come back home from the meeting just ask that you'll keep your hands upon them Lord Brother brother uh William and sister Sharon Lord are going to be coming back either today or tomorrow and I I just pray that your anointing would be with them Father we just ask that you would help us here today that you would strengthen hearts Lord open our ears to understand what you have to say and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening amen we um so we're going to start reading here at um uh um here at in page 139 and uh that's going to be our reading for tonight um and this is going to be dealing um with the the Holy Spirit and um amen the only way that you can ever hear anything from the Lord is is to um be born again and and there is a difference between the word birth and a church birth bir amen the word birth you you are it is the seed of God that is that is energized amen and you begin to see things hear things uh believe things the way God believes things amen and so then you have um amen um a church a church birth if you want to it's a church experience to where you um amen you you go by knowledge everything is is is knowledge it's what you're learning you're learning about Christ you're learning how to act you're learning uh what the denomination teaches or what the certain congregation believes or amen and so there is learning in both sides amen but as we have as we have as we have brought out here in these last um several Wednesday nights amen the Tree of Life was the breathing Living Word tree of knowledge amen is is a reasoning of the word reasoning learning so while we learn amen it's not the same way as as what we would with the in the Supernatural realm amen with the with the new birth there is that living logos that is living his word through us it's it's more than just a knowledge there is revelation it's divinely inspired it's divinely put you were part of that word at the very beginning you can't help but believe that word because you and the word are one you came out of that word and so when the Holy that's the reason why you've got to receive the Holy Ghost amen you can have the genuine word seed on the inside of you be be be predestinated but if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's not energized it's not it's not being made real to you therefore a lots of times it becomes laws and regulations because it's not part of who you are yet amen but when you when you truly are born again you are oozing Redemption you are oozing the word of God it's who you are that's everything about you there's no second thoughts about it that that's who you are can you say amen and and matters of fact we you know I I'll um let's just as we stand here I've got I've got a couple of them that I might just read to you real quickly um uh there I want to read out of page 92 and um and and down on the third paragraph it says now to get the real meaning of what we're about to go into I must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion or spiritual matters if you like is composed Ed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made up made of two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the Ephesian church is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad two Vines make the church they are like wheat and tears growing up side by side but one is the true the other is the false now God will speak to each one he will talk about each one he will call them the church only the elect will know which is the true Spirit only the elect cannot be deceived Matthew 4 24 and 24 for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall sow sign great signs and wonders in as much if they were possible it would deceive the very elected so so we've got in in the in the church system in the church we've got the two trees can you say amen and and and but the elect is the only one that'll know why because you are of the one you are you have that Eternal Word on the inside of you amen they're in uh page 98 and I'm just and you don't have to turn there if you don't want to but um if you would like to it's page 98 and it'll be down to the third paragraph amen this comes to mind as well he says all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden Ezekiel 2813a thou Satan Hast been in Eden the Garden of God so so we can see that the two trees there is the there there are the two seeds now there's the seed of the serpent there's the seed of Christ seed of the serpent goes by knowledge understanding learning reasoning looking good play the part amen Cain was a religious person done it all but without divine revelation had had no understanding of the knowledge of God Amen but Abel on the other side he was born of that seed of God and he had a divine revelation about him amen it wasn't all in churchy it wasn't all just this that and the other there was a divine revelation he was a Son of God can you say Amen now how are we going to tell the difference once again how are we going to tell tell the difference between the two seeds amen and one more before we get started the page 106 amen and we're going to start at the very last paragraph right in the middle of it amen he says he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life now this is where it's so important now he gave the word brother Wendell isn't that knowledge he gave the word well that's why we come to church is to get more knowledge brother brandham says he gave the word and he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of God death was anything that wasn't the word of God she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her all right now let's go to page 139 and we'll get started started here now I want to hear what the spirit is saying to the church it's important that we hear we want not knowledge not not in what with this but I want to be able to hear with this I want to be able to understand with this and this is where they miss it this is where because everybody has ch Church everybody's got I mean we've got churches everywhere but God has got he's got something really incredible for you so this is going to be uh tonight's going to be basically about the Holy Spirit now let's go let's let's look here and as he starts Revelations 2:11 uh he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit Seth unto the churches there is not one Church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith but it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages 1 Corinthians 2 and6 uh through 16 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory oh I love that which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written iath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of men the things that God God has prepared for them that love him but he doesn't stop there but God has revealed them unto us isn't that wonderful by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man saith the spirit of man that is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which of God that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth compar comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the Natural Things the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ now that is a powerful reading there then he goes to Matthew the 13th chapter and 13 to 16th verse therefore speak I to them in Parables this is Jesus because that they sing see not hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaas which saith by hearing ye shall hear and not understand seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is gross is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but here again but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they he then he goes to John 8: 42-44 Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word you are of your father the devil remember the two trees and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it it is most evident from these scriptures that no man in him of himself can hear God the ability has to be given him of God Matthew 16-1 17 Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven putting these verses together we see there is only one group of people and that is a very special group who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age it is one special group that receives the Revelation for each age that group is of God because the group that cannot hear it is not of God uh John 8:42 44 like we've read the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the Revelation thereof is the group that was described in 1 Corinthians 2:6 these they are the ones who have the spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized Ed into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost to further bring out what we have just said and to all uh and to also use a scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about it is that is uh about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost Jesus says in John 6:45 it is written in the prophets and they shall shall all be taught of God but turn to Isaiah 54:13 when this was taken and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord the all of God are the children of God thus it is that EV that the evidence of being a true child of God whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one that is taught the word by the Holy Ghost to me that is so incredible you see you cannot be taught of the Lord matters of fact if you if you've uh let's just hold your place because we're going to come right back and finish reading but let's skip up here to page 152 and um let's see um we're going to 152 and uh we're going to go one two three four uh four lines down and we're going to start there in very plain language y'all got that all right in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each come forth uh in in the designated decreed season each member came forth uh as he each member become come forth it become expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternally with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas God once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and Jesus and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we somebody say even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken words seed manifest in flesh those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason that we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken well shout hallelujah hallelujah amen so so as we as we are going now amen we've got the two seeds they're they're now running continuity and the and the one seed is projecting that Eternal logos in flesh others are satisfied with just becoming a a a routine istic and is Satan a man that is very religious but Satan is receiving all the glory Satan loves the honor Satan loves The Prestige Satan loves for people to set in message uh churches without the life of God and just sucking in like a sponge all of the knowledge and makes them all puffed up and feel like they are they have it together don't be one of those kind of people we want the genuine life of God pulsating from our souls amen the word of God can you say Amen so it's not in the knowledge now are you understanding have I made that clear the difference between the Revelation and the knowledge the knowledge is all appear here and it has no effects on with with anything about us Revelation places you in the scripture to where you are God's very own body here on planet Earth that's powerful F amen that's powerful all right okay so so let's uh we're going to go back we're on page 140 and all the way down to the last paragraph now brother brandham is going to talk about tongues and and share why tongues is not the evidence he says now we can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't say in any age that that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophecy Etc aside as an Evidence the evidence is hearing and he's got that capitalized hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that is exactly what Jesus said he would do when he came John 14:26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written these men are recalled to their minds uh uh and and and said that let's see these men had recalled to their minds by the Holy Ghost the very words that Jesus spake that is why the gospels are accurate they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring all things to their minds but he taught them further on the truth they had already had that is how Paul received his Revelations he said concerning it I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it of man but by revelation of Jesus Christ Galatians 1: 111 and 12 he was taught by the Holy Ghost one one day when Jesus was upon the earth a certain important man came to him and this man said Rabbi we know you're a teacher sent from God but you will notice that Jesus Cuts him short he turned to Nicodemus and the words he spoke May well be paraphrased thusly I'm not a teacher I am the sacrificial lamb for sin I'm making possible the New Birth by my spirit but there is one there is coming one who is the teacher he's the holy spirit so when Jesus was upon the Earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he come back upon the church by his Spirit he became the teacher so so now he's making it clear now you cannot you see the Old Testament was already the laws of God and so the laws were being placed upon a people without the new birth and it they couldn't handle it they couldn't live it they couldn't manifest it and I I tell you you you when you see lots of times there's too too many people sitting in in in in in our church circles that don't have the new birth they sympathize with it they want it they know it's right but they can't live it and it's just it's just going to constantly malice going this way and bickering this way and that why why can't they stay on the straight and narrow is because they've never been reborn you've got to have a new birth or the word will never have its effect and that's why that's why all of you young people and and um uh and and the young married couples we don't want a knowledge we want a birth we want the power of the holy spirit so that we can truly Manifest this to to to to the generation that we're going to be raising up can you say Amen because only then can they tell the difference between someone that got it here and someone that's got it here how the world needs to see that amen our our workers need to see that our children need to see that uh everywhere we go they need to see that it's not here but it's right here and so Jesus Is Telling Nicodemus Hey listen I I I thanks thanks for thanks for your compliment but that's not what I'm here for I am here for you to be born again Nicodemus is saying now listen I how can I be born again how can I go back into my mama's womb the second time see he was a smart man he was trying to understand but Jesus was letting him know listen I am coming for a new race I'm the first of the new race I am the word made flesh and I am coming to bring many sons unto Glory there's going to be many after me that is going to be birthed of the word just as I was birthed of the word and they're going oh they're going to be my body here on the earth they're going to live my life they're going to manifest who I am in a many membered body oh don't you just love that amen now now he says here uh uh in the next paragraph he says to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches but only a Spirit-filled man can hear the Revelation for that age none other can no sir they cannot because it's exactly what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 26-16 now we ought to make now that's ought to make you rejoice there is a most peculiar Doctrine in the air that is causing much misunderstanding and hard feelings for when the Pentecostal say You must must speak in tongues or you haven't been baptized with the Holy Ghost they are either denying that the great men like Knox Moody Taylor um gforth and others did not receive the holy ghost or saying what they all secretly uh that they all secretly spoke in tongues and were not aware of what was going on now that is not true no sir this is that is gross error tongues are not the evidence of being spirit fi it is simply one of the nine manifestations me mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 there is no scripture that says you receive the Holy Ghost uh that that you receive the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking in tongues but it does say that after they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they spake in tongues and later on says that they prophesied today amongst many uh folks it is taken for granted that all who claim to to receive the Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues speak in a spiritual in a genuine spiritual tongue but this is not so for many people speak in a known tongue but under the influence of a wrong Spirit now uh let's let's say we are in a meeting and people are all speaking in tongues how can you know which tongue is from the spirit and which one is from the devil I have been amongst the Heathen where where they their Wizards drank blood out of a skull and spoke in tongues and interpreted and prophesied they can even write in tongues now if tongues is the evidence is the evidence he's capitalized the of receiving the Holy Ghost then every tongue would have to be of God but it has to be admitted by tongue uh tongues evidence people that there are false and true tongues for God has the genuine and Satan has the false so question is this who knows what is real who understood the language to know what's spoken who has the gift of discernment to know now when we get those answers we will have something to go on but until then we have to wonder about the source of the tongues you can see right now that if you back up a tongue's evidence and don't know what is being sad you have to finally come to the place where all tongues have to be of God that would lead us then to believe that the devil cannot speak in tongues that and that is not so no not for a minute any true missionary on a foreign field knows all too well that the Devils uh Devils speak in other tongues and the same as I know by know it by experience Pentecostal theologians admit that they have no scripture setting forth that people speak with tongues when baptized with the Holy Ghost they admit that they infer it from the the experience is set forth in the book of Acts where in three out of five times people spoke with tongues they also say without any Scripture that there are two kinds of tongues one is the tongue you speak when receiving the Holy Ghost and it is the evidence while later on if you believe you can receive the gift of tongues whereby you may speak often however they say having spoken in tongues as the evidence of receiving may never speak again uh you may never speak again once more we are anxious to know where this is found in the word if it isn't there then God has not spoken it and woe unto him who would add to that word but there is something in the word about this very subject that they ignore completely 1 Corinthians 13 it mentions tongues of men and angels these would be known and unknown tongues modern Pentecostals say that they can receive the Holy Ghost speaking in un known or Angelic tongues they have the cart before the horse for in Acts two the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard and understood now so so now he's he's he's bringing it out here and we're not going to get into we are going to get into the gifts a little bit more maybe this next Wednesday night but um but here's now here he's he's bringing this in that you you know the as he was just saying you know some feel like you've got to have uh uh you might just speak in tongues one time when you receive the Holy Ghost and um now the group that I came out of um they believe that if you had not spoken tongues within 24 hours that you had lost the Holy Ghost so you could get the Holy Ghost and then if you if you haven't spoken tongues within 24 hours you have lost the Holy Ghost amen how would you like to be under that kind of teaching amen you you understand how I was up and down up and down I I read something somehow or another I I I got I got a um uh something from a church page today where a a guy you know a guy had left the Pentecostal or the apostolic movement and he had come back home and and um and so he's uh so on on the thread he was asking I want you to pray that the Holy Ghost will keep me this time and and and one of the first ones is is is an older lady and saying son welcome back to the full the Holy Ghost can keep you again and I'm thinking again he the the Holy Ghost didn't keep him the first time so what makes him think he's going to keep him again right so so it it was it you see it's it's an in- andout it's a work related thing but when though you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother you are sealed until the day of your Redemption that's why we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a seal of God that there is nothing the devil can do to take you out of that oh there there ain't there ain't no religion can take you out there's no trial can take you out there is nothing that can take you out of that of that genuine walk with God can you say Amen so so tongues come and go are there real tongues yes yes there is amen but just as the there is a real knowledge and there is a heaven or a a Heavenly real knowledge and then there is the tree of tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen uh there is also real tongues and then there is there are these others you cannot put tongues as any kind of an Evidence you can only go to the word and that word birth is the only thing that God gave us as the evidence and and there there there is quite an Evidence there man you can hide it you can hide it from the preacher you can hide it from Mama you can hide it from Daddy you can hide it but listen the seed on the inside of you you know whether there is a genuine birth that has taken place on the inside and I believe I believe the world will know it amen there will come that time now let's go on down to the next verse it says now when God is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken it we had better speak too and say what he has already said he's told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost now here he's going to tell us was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that's the sign of the indwelling Spirit uh uh that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men and put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin that is powerful to me that deserves some marking right there that's a that's a powerful uh paragraph amen it says in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word of uh heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it reveal it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it I know it was a great Temptation it is a great temptation to refer back to the day of Pentecost and also to the uh to the day when the Holy Ghost fell in the house of Cornelius and then set those two identical experiences as the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but on each of the on each occasion the tongues were understood by the listeners this is a far cry from the modern Babel of confusion of Pentecostal meetings if this were not enough to persuade us to leave off such reasoning what will we do when we are confronted with the fact that people who have never spoken tongues have some of the other eight manifestations in their lives such as the word of wisdom Discerning of spirits word of knowledge Faith healing and even Miracles and this observation is even more interesting in the light that tongues is the least of the nine gifts and so we see people who do not nor ever have spoke in tongue T use greater gifts than those who do speak in tongues we must discount such a Doctrine even more completely than before so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the Bible has not said when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of the blessed person of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the Sea of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time this is exactly correct and if these ages bring anything out they surely bring and bear out this truth can you say Amen now now before I'm I'm thinking we're going to I'm going to stop right here on this and I just want to read I want us to look at a few scriptures before we close tonight because I want us to now when we go now brother brandham is going to he's going to he's going to now going to turn his attention on the next on the next uh uh Wednesday night he's going to start turning his attention to those who say I've received the Holy Ghost because I believe and then he's going to so he's going to start now you can't say I believe so I've received the Holy Ghost you receed the Holy Ghost after you believe and then he'll start going through uh through that so if you want to read that uh throughout the week that that would be good too but we'll go back through there but now brother I I want I want to show why brother brandham says it's an inside teacher not an outside external teacher it's an inside teacher and so let's look and I think this would be good uh if we turn there um I've got about six of them to to to to to give to you tonight before we close Jeremiah 31 and33 and if you want to turn and Mark that so you'll know um I want to give you some Old Testament scripture and some New Testament scripture Jeremiah 31 and33 and when you get there Say Amen praise the Lord it says but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saeth the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor every man his brother saying know the Lord for for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest saeth the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and will remember their sins now all right that now this is this is all going back remember what brother Bram was saying the all of God all the children of God shall be taught every one of us there is not Hallelujah I don't care who you are whether whether you feel like you're smart or whe you feel like you're the dumbest in the church amen you've got the promise that all of God's children shall be Tau and it's not not necessarily that you can that you're going to understand the whole Bible it's not necessarily meaning what we're not you you can it's not how many Bible verses you learn it's not how much of the message you can quote it's not it's the divine revelation God placed the laws inside you no one even has to tell you that it's that it was those when brother Brandon was over there in Africa and there was those 30,000 people that accepted Christ and was born again no one had to tell all of those naked women and naked men they were all in that Stadium he says brother brandham says all of a sudden the women 30,000 of them imagine that the women started they they covered themselves and separating themselves from men men separating themselves from women they were all trying to what was it the teacher moved inside they never heard a sermon never heard a sermon about it it was the Holy Spirit that moved in they didn't hear it here they heard it here and that's where that's where it is oh my oh we we we we we have to it's not the preacher shouldn't be beating us and having to beat us and having to beat us it should be a part of who we are on the inside the word God God's not a cowboy he's a Shepherd my sheep hear my voice and they follow another voice they will not follow it's that simple so when the Holy Spirit it's not that we don't grow it's not that we don't and it's and and and you and it's good to be able to take what you have here and to see it here and then you can stand up and say yes yes you see what I'm saying so we we but but if but you can have it here all day long and if you don't have it here then there's nothing that can there's there's there's nothing that it does does you no good well glory to God and I tell you what am man the seed of God knows those things now let's let's look at another let's let's look at another place um amen uh let's see I've got another I thought I had a praise the Lord okay so we're in Jeremiah 31 and then um uh why we let's go to Ezekiel 36 real quick Ezekiel 36 and 25 oh this is this is Rich so rich I love him amen I tell you I love him so much Ezekiel 36 and 25 he says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you will be clean from all this now this is this is before the blood of Jesus now and you will be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you and a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and then what does it do and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them oh bless the Lord he's going to put his Spirit within us it's going to ignite the seed of God then that living logos becomes part of you you become part of it now let's let's see what the Apostle Paul says here in the book of Hebrews the 8th chapter amen this is such a good teaching I I I I I didn't know whether we should wait until the others got here too because this is such a good teaching for uh for the Youth but it's good for us all I wish we had a few more people here tonight amen uh I mean not saying that we're not proud of you being here amen but uh uh but this is this is good so so so if if you like it then maybe y'all can encourage your uh your brother and sister that's not here you need to go back and listen to that amen praise the Lord all right Hebrews 8 uh uh 8 and10 for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days now let me just stop right here okay so in all in in all of the covenants that has been made it's it is uh or in where they're talking about this Covenant the New Covenant that is coming always talks about the house of Israel so many people want to try to put it I don't care whether it's it's it's Joy to uh where it says you know uh where where it's talking about your sons and your daughters and and the spirit will be poured out it he's he's dealing with Israel he's dealing with well amen the Covenant was given to Israel the the original Covenant was Israel's Covenant but and this holy spirit that is going to be poured out remember was given to the Jews that second Covenant was given to the Jews but the Jews turned it down and the apostle Paul says I now turn to the Gentiles so so what the co what Covenant that the the Jew turned down the Jew wanted to keep the first Covenant of law of Moses and God was given them the Covenant of Grace they refused that Covenant of Grace amen and of course we understand by the other prophecies that the Gentiles it was all a plan of God God blinded their eyes to miss that Covenant so that you and I can be brought in glory to God so when you read these amen it's it's got a compound meaning it is it's it's it's it's it's it's a a New Zion the the Heavenly Jerusalem amen all right so let's let's continue on this is the Covenant I will make the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws in their heart and write them or in their mind and write them in their hearts I will be to them a God and they will be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for all somebody say all shall know me from the least to the greatest again brother bram's already dealt with the all it's only the children of God it's only the elect of God they're the only ones that's going to see it and the Holy Spirit is going to ignite that seed within them so that they can hear let's go to the 10th chapter Hebrews 10 and 10 we want to we sure want to uh keep brother Donald in our prayers I as he's going getting those those um that those uh teeth taken care of today I know it must be painful uh Hebrews 10 and 10 by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all that's that water every priest standeth daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man after it offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God and from henceforth expecting till his enemies become his foot stol for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified so the sin question is dealt with Christ has come the blood of Jesus has wiped out all of your transgressions the blood has totally eliminated every Everything the the middle wall of petition that was separating The Sinner this the the sinful son from his heavenly father that middle wall is now broke down Christ has paid the price he has paid the price for your sin now the Father and Son can come together there can be a reuniting to where the the Fallen Gods the Fallen miniature Gods can connect with the God Amen and they can Reign here on this in in this life Adam is back with Father Again reunited again and are you understanding so Christ tore down the middle wall of petition amen now you always were a son but you were in sin and there was no way that the Holy Ghost would ever come on you because the Holy Ghost is Holy and you are a sinner well glory to God but when the blood came in and took care of the sinner problem now there's no guilt now there's no sin now there's no wrongs you are just as righteous as God Is Right the Bible we just read it he has perfected forever that one sacrifice totally took care of you and your relation with God now watch that amen that's that that that's that's exactly what Jeremiah and Ezekiel were saying now watch he says for by once offering 14th verse hath he perfected forever them that are Sanctified now watch what's the holy ghost whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us okay how do I know how do I know that my sins are forgiven because God has sent his holy spirit upon you it's no longer God on this side of the Great Wall amen and you on this side the wall has been taken down now the great Holy Spirit has come over and filled you with do you still have mind battles yep do you still do you still go through those days of of of brother you're going to have more mind battles now than you did back then you're going to have more trials now than you did back then because Satan knows that there is a miniature God on the earth that is going to wreak havoc to his kingdom and Buddy he's going to start fighting you like you've never been fought but don't worry you and Papa are back together you're not on this side and God's on this side he sends the Holy Spirit to you amen ah oh the devil says oh be you but you just tell that devil shut up you've got a weapon you've got the atomic weapon can you say Amen it says 15th verse whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws in their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin you know what he's trying to say is there where the sin is gone so Christ didn't have to go back and redy and go back and lay down his life again he is so confident God doesn't have a second plan God doesn't say I might need somebody else to die or I might have to do God doesn't have to he done it once and and he done it for all he saved you once and he is able to keep you the blood that God shed on Calvary is he's it's you'll never exhaust that blood there you I don't care how many times you fallen today and how many times you fall tomorrow and how many times you're going to fall a year from now I just want to tell you the sin question has been dealt with the blood of Jesus Christ has taken care of all your sins Oh Glory to God now the seed was always in you the seed there there was always that something in you but it couldn't live but now when the Holy Spirit comes back upon you now it's written in your conscience it's written in your heart well praise the Lord amen you love it amen hallelujah now all right now so the Holy Ghost want to I didn't bring my hany the Holy Ghost is is uh again what we've just read here on the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with tongues or prophecy it has everything to do with writing my law in their mind inscribing my word in their heart that's the promise you say yeah but I want to talk about the tongues and I want to well there there are the scriptures amen they're they're in Isaiah 28 and8 uh we'll turn there real quickly I'm not going to hold you uh too much longer but let's let's look here at at at Isaiah 28 and 8 and this is a good one for for for uh for you to have in your in in your Bible brother brandham uses this a lot amen now he's he's he's talking we're fixing to see that there's the promise it's a prophecy that is to come to pass it's a prophecy I'm I'm sending it but it's going to fall it's going to fall on nonseed and and and and so let's read for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge what's the Holy Spirit knowledge Whom Shall he make understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people amen now brother brandom talks about that about the stammering lips and he shows them how how how it happens and speaking in tongues is he says they they and and he and he gives those illustrations as you've heard um um uh many times he says he says to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye uh may cause the weary to rest this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the Lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken and we understand that that was a ful that the prophecy was fulfilled now the Holy Spirit came and they rejected it but the elect of the age did receive it the elect of the age did did can you say Amen now we so so we can see even in Joel's prophecy when when Joel amen you know the pouring uh uh my you know pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and the uh young man shall have visions and the old man and he says and and I will pour out amen as the former rain and the latter rain and brother brandham talk us he said now go back and look at the former Reign see what the former Reign says and when you go back and look at what the former Reign and you look at the meaning of that in there there in the Scripture it meant teaching so when the Holy Spirit was to come even fall in this last day the former and the latter Reign it would be a restoration of the teachings of the apostles amen then the latter Reign would come upon that and cause the word to live in you it first of all had to come in a profit form and in order for you to receive the word in its fullness and become word made flesh does that make sense or no amen so so I I'm thankful for that amen there Deuteronomy 32 and and and and one it says my do Doctrine shall fall or two 32 and two my Doctrine shall fall as rain my speech shall dis steal as the Dew amen I'm so thankful for that amen Hosea Hosea 6 And1 it says come and let us re or return unto the Lord he hath torn and will heal us he has smitten and will bind us up after two days he will revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight we went through the Dark Ages went through the Dark Ages amen but then all of a sudden here here here came two days started coming again and then the layot of see and age then the third day amen we were going to rise again after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord he going forth as prepared as the morning and he shall come to us as the rain as the latter and the former Reign unto the Earth in other words he's going to come with Doctrine and with power right oh that makes me want to shout he's going to come with Doctrine we're going to learn but it's not it's it's the rain the rain that falls is going to grow it's not it's not what you're hearing here it's it's it's living here it sees that are manifesting itself through us are you don't you just love that heyen amen amen thank God for his abundance of Grace to his elect how can how can the elect be deceived when the very seed Gene of God is buried within your heart amen oh yes many of times we've got to go through those trials and we go many of times we have disappointments and things and God God you got a hard heart you you know you got stuff over your seed believe me God's got a jackhammer and he knows how to Jackhammer Hearts Amen to make sure that the seed comes to life that's right amen don't Harden your heart never Harden your heart listen if there's anybody that should should should should should practice amen I told Mary back when she was uh when she was a girl I'm sure I don't I don't know if she remembers it or not but I told her I said you're soft Mary amen you've got a very soft heart don't ever ever ever let the things of Life Harden that heart you remember that amen don't let it happen because that's a special gift that God places and and if you harden that heart you'll miss out on your purpose amen and and and and and that's what we've all got to harden or we've all got to to to guard against God don't let my heart be hardened amen the scripture says that the the that the children of Israel had a hard heart of unbelief their heart was hardened they couldn't believe anymore they couldn't receive anymore their heart was hard it it was it wasn't it wasn't right but see God's God's calling for you and me you man to have very soft Hearts I want my heart to be soft so that the so that the sea disposition should be soft our our disposition shouldn't be hard Sten you know we we we stand because that's that's just the character of the seed on the inside of us but we're not we're not hardened people the only thing that makes me and you hard the only thing that makes you and I bionic is the seed that Eternal Jean seed on the inside but if you've got a hardened heart or you got a hardened disposition about you you've got a hardened stance you got a hardened personality well this is just the way well that that we we should we we've got to surrender our hardness and let his seed come living within us we've got to be tender and he's got to be strong I want I've got to keep a tender heart yeah sometimes I sometimes I get hit sometimes I get hurt so bad that I I I can't even I can't I it's hard I've been hurt so so bad that I I can't even hardly breathe I just feel like I'm going to smother feel like I'm going to suffocate I've hurt so badly but it's in those times that God has put me through those things I've noticed amen what is he doing he's he's breaking up the fellow grounds of my heart why because he wants his seed to live God's seed can't live in hard ground we need the rain rain fall on me Lord can you say amen amen praise the name of Jesus oh aren't you glad that God sees something special in you aren't you glad that God all sometimes amen as as we went through these last couple Wednesday nights on the on the trials and the hardships and the things you see those things are there to make sure that your heart is soft don't resist the master tonight let me just end the end by saying that as the musicians come let's not resist the master don't resist him in your life amen keep that heart that is so soft that's the only way that's the only way word is going to be made flesh that's the only way not not this not oh please don't let this come in your brain here don't let don't let this come into your brain that's not the intent of doing these Wednesday nights the intent of these Wednesday nights is to let you see that God's got a purpose bigger than just sitting in a church and aming a sermon he's got a bitter plan he wants he wants to he wants his loud he wants that the Lov of God to funnel down not in the body of Jesus Christ this time but to funnel down in your body in my body and live live is that right amen that's right that's what that's what brother bandam said amen as as Adam and Eve was walking out and he said stop stop stop I can't let you live I can't let you leave the garden like this I can't let you leave amen and he went and slew a lamb he says that great funnel that great L he says and then amen then he says and now I see I see I see another one I see God in Christ dragging that Crossen the blood oozing out and amen the blood spot getting bigger and bigger he says what was it he said it was the love of God love of God being expressed amen what are you you're the love of God being expressed not here here it's it's just you you're thinking like
