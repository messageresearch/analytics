times we might beat our backs with different things that different ones have tried Through the Ages to try to earn it nothing that they could do could get to God it took him coming down [Music] and being in a human form like us to pay the price so that way he could bring us up to him let's go ahead and open our Bibles and we're just going to turn to the front of the Bible Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 and we're going to start at verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them let's go ahead and pray Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we lord all we can say is that we thank you Lord and that we love you and we appreciate all that you've done for us Lord Lord as always were a needy people Lord whether there were written requests Lord I know that there are needs on every heart that's here Lord and Lord I'm just a mortal man I don't know what type of situations every every person is facing I know what don't know what type of worries or concerns or problems they may be dealing with but but Lord you know each and everyone Lord Lord we pray that you would just take control of the service Lord take control of my my lips Lord may I just say what it is that you would have me to say Lord may it be uplifting to the people may it minister to the needs Lord and Lord may we be able to to walk away knowing that that we didn't hear from from me we didn't hear from Harry Lancaster but we heard from from you Lord that you are the one to speak to us Lord Lord I pray that you would just take control of the remainder of the service and we just commit it into your hands the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats brother brandom in the sermon uh in 1953 questions and answers on Genesis he starts to describe and dramatize the way that brother brandom does what it was before creation he describes that it was just God there was nothing else and it was even he wasn't really called God yet because God means to be an object of worship so he was just the self-existing one and he was there and then brother brandom describes that you see uh the light of the logos come into being and he says it's like a a child playing in front of his father's house and this is goes on in this Timeless space since there was no time you have no idea how long it was this was the the condition and then God begins to brother brandom the way he says is God begins to think and begins to consider what he wants to do and what he wants to create and what he wants to make and till finally he goes to the point of beginning to say Let There Be and he goes through the process of creation and goes through the process of making everything that we know to be in the universe and he goes through this process and he and brother brandom obviously does such a great job dramatizing talks about this atom explodes and this happens and this happens and this little clinker is flying off here and this is flying off there and what is God doing well he's creating the Zodiac he's creating the first Bible in the sky and then he goes on and does this and does this and he goes through every one of these steps and then at the end he goes down and everything has been created before for he has all these different things but yet God's desire through all of this is that he wants to have fellowship with someone yes he has had the angels that can worship him that can praise him but he wants to have someone that he can visit with and talk with and have a relationship with and so he makes the decision let us create man in our image I want to create something that can fellowship with me that's in that's not less than or but it's like me I want to create something that it's in my image this is what I'm making and so I'm going to create ma male and female created he them as the scriptures say and Genesis 2 Verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I'll will make an help meat for him him so God had created Adam he had put him on the earth to to tend the garden to to take care of everything that was there yeah but the same desire that God had in himself for Fellowship he looked at Adam and he could see Adam is alone the same way that I have been alone for so long now Adam is in this same condition Adam is in the condition where he needs that fellowship and he needs that Fellowship because I made him like me I made him in my image and so the thing that I desire is what Adam desires if I desire fellowship if I created man because I want Fellowship then this man needs Fellowship yes he has the animals to rule over he has the garden to tend but he doesn't have anyone to talk to and yes I come down on the evening and I visit with him but he doesn't have anyone the rest of the day he doesn't have anyone that's that's there with him he doesn't have anyone that he's connecting to that he's relating to that he's building this relationship with all right and so he chooses to put Adam to sleep and and take a rib and he splits the spirit as brother brand describes he says he takes the male the Burly spirit and he puts it in the man in Adam and he takes that tender little delicate feminist spirit and puts it in the woman all right and now you have man and woman together and they are able to have Fellowship they are able to be together and the whole reason that they had that desire the whole reason that God would choose to give Adam this woman to give him Eve is because Adam had the same desire that he did because he had chosen to make God In His Image he didn't choose to make him like the bear or like this or like that take your pick of what animal was out there but he went no they're going to be in my image which means they're going to have the same desires they're going to want the same things they're going to have that same tug that they want to be able to have this relationship they want to be able to have communion they want to be able to have fellowship with one another brother brandom says in the sermon Fellowship in 1955 he says Fellowship wonderful thing now why does men like Fellowship why is it men like to meet with men women meet with women we all like to meet together the Le ladies meet together and sew and talk and the men go to a table and they have things in common they like to talk about that come from somewhere what makes you love your children because you're a father that's that's a strain a human strain that's the reason it proves that we have a heavenly father that loves we his children all the things is now made of things that was the Bible said there's nothing new in the world now in the beginning when God made man he didn't make him to be sick he didn't make him to have cancer he never made him to die he made him for Fellowship now in the evening when it was quiet God came down and had fellowship with Adam and Eve and in 1959 in uh dedication of building to the Lord Brother Ram says then being the Church of God God ordained a certain place for these people to meet in where there would be Fellowship because God longs to fellowship with his people and among his people now Fellowship is companionship it's a company it's one definition as you go down the the list of as you're in the dictionary of what the definition of Fellowship is one of them says it's a company of equals or friends and that one struck out to me a little bit because obviously we don't look at it as well I can have fellowship with God and we're equals no but it's a a company of friends now that we can go with I can be in fellowship with God because God has called me friend God Has Lifted Me Up God has put me in that place to be his friend to have Fellowship back and forth one another yes prise the Lord now we know that Satan hates Fellowship yeah Satan doesn't like it when we're all together Satan doesn't like it when everyone is being friend ly when everyone is getting along when everything is Flowing smoothly Satan doesn't like that 1 Peter chapter 5 at verse 8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world now we've talked many times and heard many sermons about Satan being a roaring lion brother brandom talks about it many times and this roaring lion if you you know take a little bit of time to look at how Lions hunt you know Lions normally go after while they will occasionally tar small smaller animals if necessary they prefer to get large very meaty animals that travel and hers they normally go after Wier beasts they normally go after I'm trying to remember the the list off the top of my head analou they normally go after these herd animals and so when they go to go after their prey they are normally looking for one that has straighted off by itself or those that are lagging behind that are to the outskirts of the herd they're not trying to pick the prey that's in the very center of this herd of animals you know one of the other ones they go after are buffalo buffalo are big animals they're not going to fight their way through all the other Buffalo to get to the one in the center that's not going to happen but they look for the ones that are on the outskirts they look for the ones that are a little weaker they look for the ones that are sickly they look for the ones that have DEC decided to wander off by themselves because they saw that mouthful of grass after over there and decided that that was worth leaving the group for they look for one that is gotten away from the protection of the group right Satan's always trying to find a way to get us to separate from each other to separate from fellowship for separate from fellowship with our brothers and sisters to separate from fellowship with God because that's when he has his best chances taking a prey while we're in the middle of the pack while we're there with all of our brothers and sisters around us while we're there feeling the the presence of God and and being right there in love with God we're not in much danger we have the protection all around us we are in the middle of the herd we're not the target Satan would love to make you the target but as long as you're in that spot the roaring lion isn't going to come after you there are other weaker options around the edges okay but if you start to stray out if you start to to get to that edge if you start to leave the company leave the group leave the presence of the Lord and get off on your own that is what Satan is looking for That's what Satan is waiting for none of us believe that the different types that are described in the Bible are used lightly I don't think that God when he was having Peter write this had him describe the adversary as a roaring lion just because well it sounds Fierce that's a that's a fierce description that'll work no I think generally when God puts a description in there there's a lot to it he doesn't when we look at creation God doesn't do things in simple ways yeah he likes to be very in depth and so the lion isn't just going well this is the the you know we're depicting that Satan's a very strong adversary and strong very Fierce like well no let's look into some details on what does the lion do how does he take out and he wants you alone he wants you separated he wants you away from the security of the herd of the pack of the family of God he wants you off by yourself in this great servant Moses brother brandom says Moses was back there waiting and now and there he was what did he do he went to work for his father-in-law Jethro and he was hurting his sheep out in the desert place there's a perfect picture here before us tonight of a Believer out of fellowship with God there he was no Fellowship not one thing in that 40 years was spoke that God did for him or any way any Supernatural he was out of fellowship and when the church gets out of fellowship with God Miracles cease signs and wonders cease Revival cease God just moves right out when you get out of Fellowship the thing to do is keep that's what I'm trying to say a while ago the love of God in your heart keep fellowship with him he these things just as don't think so and so Moses out of Fellowship no Fellowship out there in a strange country strangers not own people the people eth and he was a Jew and they're completely out of reach of God seemingly and God all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess that man makes out of the program of God God's going to straighten it out that's right and in the sermon I will restore he says so not only among the Pentecostal denominations but all denominations this great pal has broken down Brotherhood it did it with the Lutheran it's did it with the Baptists it did it with the Presbyterians it's did it with the nazarin it's did it with the Pentecostals it's always been that old worm in there to make them isolate themselves we got it you ain't got nothing what a Pity now isolate is to set apart from others isolation is basically the opposite of Fellowship to isolate is to go off and to be by yourself and so often that is what the devil is trying to drive us to do and particularly taking a few moments to speak to our front row group here That's what Satan will especially try to do to you as you're going through your teenage years as you were growing up as you were maturing Satan is going to do everything he can to make you feel like you are alone like you are different like you don't deserve to be in this place or in that place because I can't control my emotions I can't handle this I why do I always get frustrated why do I always get upset why am I always blowing up why am I always doing this or doing that I don't even deserve to have friends I should don't even deserve to be at church I don't even deserve God's love take your pick of which statement it is all right but but Satan will do everything he can and once you're past those years it doesn't mean you're immune to it but those are especially hard years as you're going through that time as you are maturing as you are growing as you are going through all kinds of changes in your body which are taking you to a great place this is what God has designed you to do this is what God has designed the human body to do but it is a Time time when you are especially sensitive it's a time when you are especially susceptible to it because all too often there are things happening that make it where there are certain parts that you can't quite control as much as you want to as much as you want to go okay I I'm not going to get so frustrated this time when I'm with my friends I'm going to I'm going to be able to I'm going to hold it together I'm going to do whatever and yes you still pray to God for self-control but it's going to be a hard battle in those years you going to go through a lot and Satan is going to keep trying to make you go off by yourself because he wants to isolate you he wants to pull you away from the friends that they may tease you but they're there to support you he wants to pull you away from the family that is there to love and and guide you he wants to pull you away from the church that is there to love and support you he wants to get you isolated because this is the young prey that he's going after these are the ones that he wants to take away God calls us to Fellowship God has designed us to Crave Fellowship but yet we go through those times in our lives when we're like I just need to be alone now there's different kinds of being alone God calls us to go get alone in your prayer closet and spend time with him that's a good alone if you can be alone with God you're not alone you're in a good place if you are alone with God Devil's not going to do a whole lot if you are right there with him but when you go on a go off by yourself and it's more focused on having a pity party it's more focused on beating yourself up because man I messed up again or I did this or I did that Satan's over there just rubbing his hands together going all right now I've got something to work with now I've got a place to go I've got someone that I can put some darts in I've got someone that I can take a strike at yeah and and like I said when we get to be adults it doesn't mean that we're immune from this we can no longer blame it on hormones going all over the place but we can fall into that same trap where we go man I just don't really want to be around anybody I just I don't I don't feel connected I don't feel whatever and I'm not leaving the church I'm just slipping on a little bit I'm just boy that looks a little bit Greener over there maybe I should go check out what that's like maybe I should go take a taste of this or do this and I'm staying in the Border I'm just right here at the edge Satan is always trying to find the way to get us to isolate ourselves sure and whether that's because we have hurt feelings from something somebody said that it rubbed me the wrong way and 99% of the time they probably have zero clue that they said anything to hurt you it wasn't their intention they weren't trying to but they said something that happened to connect to a memory or a piece of history or something that is in your head that got you all riled up and it's probably history that had nothing to do with them in the first place I'm not going to ask for hands but I could on how many of us have been there and done that and then later on you're realizing wait they don't know anything about my history hey I've only been here in Pon for six years y'all don't know about my history from when I was a kid unless I happen to share it with you so if you say something that hurts my feelings because of something that happened to me as a kid how can I blame you for it you don't know you have no idea but yet so often will allow that to start to pry us away from friends family church family will allow those things start to pull us away from fellowship and we'll let that little bit that little root of bitterness start to pull us away from God because that that hurt that we think is so focused on another human being is actually coming between us and God because I'm allowing that Grudge or that hurt feeling towards my brother towards my sister to now keep me out of fellowship with them but if God's in them that means my fellowship with God is not the place it was before it doesn't mean that I'm no longer in fellowship with God in some way at least but there's a fracture there there's a break that's come in place because I've allowed this old hurt I've allowed this old complex I've allow this old memory to come up and so we're not immune once we get past our teenage years as as adults we don't suddenly go yes I never have to worry about this anymore now the hurt feelings still come through they still happen but they are especially hard for the teenagers because so much of it is they don't understand what's going on in their body they don't understand what's going on in their head they don't understand why they're thinking these kind of thoughts and where in the world this is coming from but Satan is trying to isolate he's trying to pull us apart yes and hearing himm in 1957 brother random says oh brother when you isolate yourself from the rest of the Believers God will move away you've got to love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another when the Methodist and the Baptist and the Lutheran and the Pentecostal can stand arm in arms and March forward you'll see one of the mightiest outpourings of the spirit of God that you've ever seen the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another oh go ahead you just fight kill yourselves but let us unite in one big front watch what happens then watch what goes on now I know this quote brother brandom's talking about Methodist Baptist Lutheran Pentecostal let's just throw this one in message we can even go more into it when new life Outreach can stand arm in- arm he's not necessarily looking Satan is quite happy if we are fighting inside he doesn't even need us fighting with other message churches for just fighting here he's good he'll take whichever one he can get whichever way that he can drive division in whichever way that he can do to keep us separated from each other to keep us out of Fellowship yeah very true brother brandom talks about the fact that Satan Lucifer was right next to God when he was there he couldn't create but he was right there with God and so he knows what God's desires are he knows what God yearned for and he knows that we being made in God's image have those same desires he knows we have that desire for fellowship and so he wants to tear that apart he wants to set us a in a society where we can all just be sitting at home chatting with a person on the other side of the world and that's all the connection that I need and we've heard multiple times through different sermons as people talk about different studies that point out that even the world is now realizing this is not a good thing they're not getting good results from this having an a where all of your relationships are based on the internet is not a positive thing but yet Satan continues to move it more to go this is what life should be like you don't need to be in Fellowship you can be good on your own yeah you know when you look at Hollywood and you look at uh modern entertainment you'll find this thing that is described as the Lone Wolf pretty much any action movie that's ever been made is about the Lone Wolf I'm sure no one here has ever watched any of the movies I'm about to mention I haven't even watched all of them but I'll admit I've watched some of them but you've got like Rambo he can take on the world all by himself he doesn't need anyone to support him you've got uh Chuck Norris in any of the movies that he was in one man Wrecking Crew can take on anybody he's all on his own and you go through movie after movie or book after book and it's rare that you find one that it's about the team working together it's rare that it's about this group that is able to accomplish something it's more often presented as this is the hero who can do everything by himself it's up to him to save it and then he walks away from the town that he saved to find the next problem he has to fix and we have at a society where people begin to look at that as man that's that's what I want to be I want to be the lone wolf that can take on anything I want to be the L lone wolf that can face any enemy come out on top and then go to find the next problem yeah but even the very term Lone Wolf doesn't actually make a lot of sense wolves by Nature are pack animals if you start to look into it a lone wolf normally doesn't survive very long normally the only reason it's a lone wolf is because have been kicked out of the pack it's either too old or too weak to contribute all right and so it is struggling to survive on its own and it normally doesn't last that long but yet somehow we live in a society where now we've changed it to the idea of a lone wolf means that you're something special where if you actually look at it in nature a lone wolf is probably someone that's going to die in that long because they've left the pack they're not with the support and the security that they're supposed to have we have a lot of those kind of terms as you go through the English language I'm sure most most people here have heard the term uh pull yourself up by your own bootstraps yeah so that is a term that changed first off let's lay this out real clearly it is physically impossible for you to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps lay on the ground and then pick pick at your bootstraps and see if you can get yourself up it doesn't work and originally that's what the term meant if you study the language back a little bit trying to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps was to say you cannot do this it was to say that this is an impossibility it was to say that this is something that you are going to fail at but somewhere through the course of time it changed to be man I am just that good I can pick myself up by my own bootstraps and keep on going I don't need any help I can do it all by myself kind of fits that Lone Wolf mentality that you think I can do it all alone I can go out there and I can take on the world with no support and come out on top it's the kind of world that Satan wants us to be in it's the kind of world that Satan wants us to give into he wants us to give into that mindset that man I can I can do that I can take on the enemy I can handle whatever the problem is all by myself I don't need help I don't need support if I make a mistake I'll figure out how to get out of the mess I'll do this I'll do that and we give ourselves those type of the world gives itself those kind of descriptions like the Lone Wolf so they feel Fierce and powerful and strong instead of realizing maybe you're just a prey that has wanded too far away from the herd because there's still that roaring lion out there because the scripture doesn't describe the one person going off by themselves as the roaring lion the scriptures describe Satan is the roaring lion he's the one that's coming after us he's the one that's trying to get us isolated that trying to get us away from everyone amus 3 and verse3 says can two walk together except they be agreed in 1957 why some people can't keep the victory brother brandom says I believe the Pentecostal Church has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe the rest of you do too that claim it I believe your speaking in tongues is right I believe that your prophecies are right being a Baptist I believe it sure I do but there's one thing brother it's not keeping the right kind of time that's what I'm trying to say so it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come into the human heart there to make the thing run right the love of God God is love and unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of Love it'll become selfish and indifferent pull itself off off and isolate itself and cross over and fuss and stew but when it's anchored right in the middle of Love it'll Fellowship everywhere and that's right that's exactly what we need the church is dying for love brother in fellowshipping with God through reconciliation brother random says Fellowship God wanting to fellowship with man always wanted to do it the Old Testament all of it was full of the shed blood without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and when there's no remission of sin there's no Fellowship you've got to get away from sin before you can ever have fellowship with God because God can't fellowship with sin so you're born to sinner shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and how can you ever do it you just might as well quit right now to begin with you can't do it within yourself but there is one who died to bring you to Fellowship back not only to Fellowship but relationship with God to make you Sons and Daughters of God died for that purpose come here proved himself Emanuel omnipotent and when an omnipotent speaks the miraculous happens Satan spends his time wanting to break those yolks of Fellowship wanting to break the bonds of Fellowship that keep us together when we talk about the church being a mighty Army the Army works as groups even when you go into looking at a group like the seals the seals are trained to work together in a coordinated fashion there even though they might be the mightiest Warriors that anyone can think of or name they're not trained to go off on one by one they are trained to work together to accomplish the objective they are trained to know that I'm doing this and I know that that guy's watching my back and we know when we go after the next objective he knows he can go for it because I'm watching his back and I'm going to make sure no one gets him they're not trained to be onean wrecking Crews or any of these kind of things that Hollywood likes to depict they are trained to work together to accomplish their objective and they are trained to protect one another to accomplish their objective even when you go through and you look at you when you go in and you look at David's Mighty Men you have standing above all of them you have the three that stand out and they each one have something where it talks about them doing this one thing on their own to accomplish this great task but as you also read through history and commentaries and things you find out that often the three actually fought together that's one of the reasons they were called the three now they would be sent separately sometimes obviously these were great warriors of David he would use them but often they were together you weren't normally he wasn't David wasn't sending one man to take out 800 or 500 or however many if God allowed that to happen wonderful but that wasn't what they planned their battle strategy around you didn't go into it thinking this one person is going to take on the whole Army by themselves right and even then they didn't do it by themselves they had god with them this wasn't one amazing Warrior that could do it all on their own this was one man strengthened by God to do the battle Satan wants us to be on our loan Satan wants us to feel alone Satan wants us to think that we can handle it alone yeah Satan will take different routes on how we want to do it he may want he may want to drive you to be alone and feel so helpless like you can't do it but at the same time he'll take you if you if you want to go off and be like man I'm that good I can do it alone he'll work with that too he is quite happy to go after you if you think you're that stuff if you think that you're that strong he will be glad to face you oneon-one as long as the one-on-one means you're not bringing god with you Satan is always out to isolate and he'll use whatever method he can from the hormones in a teenager to the hurt feelings of an adult he'll use whatever he can to use that wedge to drive you apart to take you away from those that you need to have with you in the sermon Fellowship in 1960 brother brandom says now God wanted fellowship and if we no matter if man today is a fallen Son of God there are some parts of God still with that man in his Fallen State you take a man today that can split atom or molecule or whatever you want to call it and can drive a jet plane around the world in a few hours and you can see that he is something in him is a fallen creation now he cannot create anything but he can pervert what has been created into something to better himself and that shows that man never come from an animal life because animal continually builds the same habitation to live in but man makes him a better house a better way of living better clothes better transportation now all of that shows something behind find it even in his Fallen State he's still a Son of God fallen and then when he wants fellowship and when we want courtship and things like that it has to come upon a basis of an agreement now when God made man in the beginning to fellowship with him then this man was in perfect Fellowship in the garden of Edom he was in perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been on that day when God would come down in the cool of the evening and call Adam and he and Eve would come up and they would worship God and they would fellowship and commune one with another 1965 Satan's Eden and so God knew that we would be here but then he puts us in flesh so we would be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in Fellowship when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I became his son and was born of him I was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so that we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning right and we know that Satan is out to strike down everything that God made to pervert it to change it to make it into his kingdom he wants to pervert whatever is there and so he doesn't want us to have that desire for Fellowship he doesn't want us to be able to achieve that desire for Fellowship he doesn't want us to be able to satisfy that because he wants us to be filling that and satisfying ourselves in a different way he wants us to satisfy ourselves with the different types of relationships that the world give the different types of relationships that make them feel like they're connected in some way without there actually being that True Fellowship you know when you've got somebody that you're having real fellowship with that you are really in that kind kind of connection to You can disagree and you may disagree heatedly you may be both passionate about what you're disagreeing about but you'll still be able to get together the next day and visit some more and spend more time together you'll be able to still connect because you have more in common than whatever this thing that you're disagreeing about is and you know what this may be a topic that you talk about a lot you know we'll keep it light for a minute there are plenty of people that vehemently disagree about football you know there are OSU fans there are ou fans and they can Fellowship they may have some heated discussions about football but they can still Fellowship about other things they can actually Fellowship about the OSU you and which team's better and who who came out on top this year this that or the other and you can do the same thing with all kinds of sports and all kinds of topics going on well you know my team's the better one this year and why are you still supporting that team and you know all this kind of stuff you go back and forth on but yet they'll still get together and talk about hunting or golf or work or family stuff or church stuff or whatever it might be but when you have somebody that you can really fellowship with the disagreement doesn't make go I'm never going to talk to them again the disagreement doesn't make you go okay I'm cutting them off of my friend list or in this Modern Age I am unfriending you I don't even want to see what you post anymore we are done we are separated normally friends have disagreements and normally that's one of the things like if you have that really good friend if you're able to have that really good fellowship with somebody is one of the few people in the world that you will trust to tell you what you don't want to hear doesn't mean you like hearing it but that's the person that you will trust to tell you what you really don't want to hear and that's the kind of relationship we're supposed to have with God we're supposed to have such fellowship with God that when he comes down and he looks at you and he goes brother Merl you need to work on this area in your life and brother Merl is sitting there going man we've just had some wonderful weeks it's been great Services I've been in the presence of God I felt so close and now God's telling me I got to work on this I thought we were in a good spot but if if brother Merl truly has that kind of love and that kind of fellowship with God he's not going to like hearing it but he's going to be willing to accept it it's not going to drive him off make go you know what I'm gonna skip church this week I'm gonna go do this instead or ah I got a cough I I think I'm going to stay home whichever it might be he's because the relationship the fellowship is more important and that relationship has pointed out an area of his life that needs to be addressed that's the kind of relationship that we should have with our spouses yeah I will be the first one to say I hate it when my wife points out something in my life that I need to work on I don't want to hear it I want her to be telling me how great I am and how wonderful I am how you know boy you are an amazing husband you're a wonderful father all those kinds of things that's what I want to hear but if there's one person in my life that can see my flaws it's going to be the one that's closest to me and if I love her and I have fellowship with her and I have a good relationship with her I need to be able to take that and I need to know that she's speaking it out of love she's not looking at me going you know I don't like that he does that I just want him to be more the way I think he should be and so I'm going to tell him this needs to change if she's pointing out something I need to be trusting that she's pointing out something going I don't think God likes that in your life I think that maybe this needs to change to better our family or to better your relationship with God and that should work vice versa this isn't just the wives talking to the husbands and I guarantee my wife doesn't like it if I try to point out something to her either because guess what we're both human beings and human beings don't like correction we're not happy with it we don't enjoy it but when there's that relationship you know The Human Side may rise up just a little bit at that first moment going how dare she be telling me that I need to fix this or do that there's still this this flesh man that that causes problems but I should be able to take that from her because I'm in that kind of relationship I'm in that kind of fellowship with her okay now not just anyone can walk up to me and say hey you need to work on this in your life if I don't have a relationship with you why in the world am I going to listen to you why in the world am I going to trust what you have to say that's right but it's the same thing we get from God and sometimes that comes from I'm GNA hide down here sometimes it comes from the guy behind the pulpit sometimes pastor's up here and he's he's preaching away and he is delivering what God is telling him to say yeah and he's stomping all over you or he's stomping all over me I can't sit there and go brother Wendell has no right to be telling me that or we'll take brother W out of it whatever visiting Minister happens to be here that we don't have a relationship with it's somebody brother Wendell invited this guy in I don't know him I know nothing about him and how dare he be in my business but if I am in fellowship with God and if I have a relationship with God then I should be able to take that correction and yes I may the flesh man may rise up just a little bit while I'm sitting back there it may not want to take it it may not be happy about taking it but if there's that relationship there if I am still in communication with my Creator all right now if I'm not in communication with my Creator if I haven't been fellowshipping with him if I haven't been praying if I haven't been reading his word and listening to the prophet it's be pretty easy to ignore what's being said yes it's be very easy for me to start to isolate myself even more because there's no relationship to support this what's coming out to me and so now I've got hurt feelings that want to drive me off even further Satan will use anything he can he'll use your brothers and sisters around you to say something he'll use situations in your life that make you hey I had to work I had I had to work longer hours this week than normal I've got stresses from these bills or from this sickness or from this situation going on and I'm just tired I'm worn out I'm crabby and I've been so busy I haven't prayed like I should I've been so busy that I haven't been able to do my devotion time the way I should I've been so busy with this that of the other and it's like that herd of buffalo where that that weak or sickly starts to wander towards the side and it becomes the target for the lion all right because now it's getting off on its own it's not staying with the herd Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Ecclesiastes chapter 4 starting at verse 9 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 24 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching in another translation it says it is and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day Drawing Near we live in a world where people just keep getting more and more disconnected sister fresa posted something on the chat just the other day that talk one of the things that listed was the fact that you go back however many years and everybody knew their neighbor and now you live next to strangers we live in an age in a world where that's kind of the standard now is I don't know who lives next to me I don't know who else is in the neighborhood I don't know the parents of my kids' friends I don't know this that or the other and we get so isolated and so on our own and even in the church it's so easy for that Spirit to start to get on us to go hey it's not that important for me to get together hey I'm at service I'm at every service why do I need to go to the fellowships or why do I need to get together when the church is doing this or doing that now I'll be the first one to say I can't make it to every single birthday party we got way too many birthdays In This Crowd okay that's not going to work can't make it to every single one and I think most of us will probably say the same thing I can't make every single one but we can still try to get together and this just in the years I've been here I've always been so impressed at how good this church is with that but it's so easy for us to start getting wrapped up in whatever is going on and start to go well you know that's not that important it's not that big a deal you know getting together for lunch between services I will be the first one to say that can be a real hassle sometimes and I know all those that are driving from someplace other than paon e it can be a hassle to bring the food and get everything ready when you're having to transport it that far and if I forgot something I can't just run back to my house real quick can I get an amen from Sister Karen from those that travel a little bit it's not always the easiest thing to do and there are times where I enjoy that we're not meeting and I go back to still water and eat and go to my house and I relax there for a short time and then come back to church I enjoy that now and then once every six weeks or whatever it is we do but at the same time we're supposed to be staying in Fellowship we're supposed to be staying together which means that I should be working towards the goal of I'm going to do my best to be there sure there going to be times I can't make it there are going to be times things are going on I even have it on occasion where my job has the occasional meeting on a Sunday afternoon if that happens I'm probably not going to be at lunch so I'm going to head to Still Water to do my meeting and then come back things are going to happen where we can't make every single one things are going to happen where we can't make every single birthday or we can't make every single fellowship or we can't make every single whatever it might be and that's life God didn't put in the scripture that we're supposed to be at every single event that the church has but we are still supposed to have this desire and this longing for fellowship and that's connecting with my brothers and sisters and if that means that I'm figuring out how to get food from Missouri to Pon e that's what's going to happen if it's we're figuring out how to get food from still water which is not nearly as far as Missouri tupon we're going to figure out and we're going to make it happen I'm not always going to be happy about it I'm not always gonna think it was easy but yet you're going to have that desire to go I want to be there in Fellowship I want to be with my brothers and sisters I want to be around them no I can't make every single birthday but I can sure come to a decent amount of them and be there to be with my brothers and sisters to be in fellowship with them all right Satan wants to push us apart Satan wants to use everything he can to make us feel like we're isolated like we're separated and yes I'm going to pick on sister Karen some more it's probably easier to make sister Karen and brother Steve feel isolated all the way in Missouri than it is to make brother Caleb feel isolated living across the street or just down the street from who knows how many people in the church yeah there is a physical distance that affects it but there is still a fellowship that happens when we get together and we're able to share our little licks of fire together and we're able to talk about the good things of the Lord and talk about what's been happening in Life or talk about what's going on and our goal is obviously if I come in and I'm talking about life I'm hoping there's a brother or sister that can encourage a little bit if I'm talking about the stresses that are going on at my job or whatever it is hopefully there's a brother or sister that instead of just going man you've got a bad job hopefully there be somebody that goes you know what God's using you where you're at God's giving you a testimony through this situation God's doing this or doing that God calls us and God has given us this desire for Fellowship because it's the very desire he has God has the desire to be in fellowship with us he created man for the purpose of fellowship and then he chose to come down and clothe himself in human flesh because we had lost that fellowship and there was no way we could get back to him and God's desire for Fellowship was so strong that he was like I will pay the price myself I will create a body I will dwell in it I will come down I will die so that I can have fellowship with you again God's desire for Fellowship is that strong that not only would he create us to begin with but that he would then pay the price after sin had come in to spoil it he would pay the price to redeem us and bring us back so that we could once again have that Fellowship so that we could be in service and we could feel his presence among us and we could have those moments Weeping at the altar or those moments when we're just standing there praising God or those moments in our closet when we're all by ourselves and God comes in and is talking to us are those moments when God visits us on the job side or in the grocery store whatever it might be and just God drops down and just gives you that little to remind you hey I'm here and I want to spend time with you Satan wants to isolate Satan wants to separate us Satan wants to drive us apart Satan wants to do everything he can and part of us wants to look at and go well as long as I'm still connecting to God if I get sep separated from the people it's okay cuz that's people this is God as long as I'm here we're good but then we remind ourselves and we have to remember that God is in his people and so those people that I'm allowing wedges to come in between that's God there you know if I'm standing up here and I have an issue with brother Colby and so I'm avoiding him and I'm staying away from him I am also separating myself from the gifts that God has placed in that man I am also separating from the things that God could be using him to minister to some part of my life in right you know it's easy to pick on the ones that get up on this platform in some way if I have an issue with brother Colby or with brother Merl I'm probably not going to enter into the worship the same way because every time I look at them I'm going to think about whatever the issue is or whatever the problem is but it's no less real if it's a brother or sister that doesn't do anything in public you know Sister Carol in the back I don't really know how you have a problem with sister Carol but that's between you and God but you know if I've got a problem with sister Carol maybe it's not going to affect me the entire worship service but if I happen to glance over and I see she's got her hand up and she's entering in then suddenly I going what a hypocrite how could she do that when she said this about me and you whatever whatever it might be and now suddenly whatever I was getting out of the service just got thrown out because I got wrapped up into my hurt or my problems all right there's a reason that when we come to communion that we are supposed to be examining ourselves and that we are told if you have a problem with your brother or sister go make it right don't come up and take this if you still have odd in your heart against a brother or sister or you still have unconfessed sin against a brother or sister you still have this or that God doesn't take Fellowship lightly he doesn't take this as this is a once a year coffee meeting or this is a once a year whatever to God Fellowship is the very purpose behind creation Fellowship is why he made man because he desired Fellowship he created more than one because he knew that they desired Fellowship he could have just left it as Adam and if he had done that it would still just be Adam and him that's that's it but God knew Adam has that same desire he needs Fellowship as well so he needs his partner and each one of us is the same way we're not designed to be on our own we're not designed to be the Lone Wolf or to do this or do that God has designed us to have fellowship with our brothers and sisters God has designed us to have fellowship with him we can't think that we can handle it all on our own we can't think that we're okay and I know that is probably hardest for all us guys because we want to handle it on our own we want to be the big strong guy that I can handle my own problems I don't need to be bailed out I don't need help or support I can I can do it because I am a man but God hasn't made us that way God has made us to want Fellowship to desire fellowship and God has designed us to be in fellowship with him and in fellowship with our brothers and sisters this isn't something that we should take lightly this isn't something that we should just talk about Super E like oh yeah let's just let's get together for some fellowship it'll be great I mean it will be great that's that's a good thing this also isn't something that we toss around e like if I'm getting together with brother Miguel and we're going to have some fellowship I hope it's going to be about more than just what his latest electrical job was or what my the latest day at Chick-fil-A was like hopefully we're going to let our little licks of fire start to Fellowship a little bit and we're going to be talking about God and talking about what he's done to us recently and hey I recently was reading this verse and this stood out to me and I I've read this verse numerous times and I don't know why I never saw it before or I was listening to this message and brother Brandon was preaching and I know I've listened to this message before but I heard him say this and it never clicked before our fellowship is more than just hey you like coffee great let's have some coffee hey you like playing golf let's go play around to golf there's nothing wrong with golf I've played golf multiple times not multiple years so I don't need an invitation I'm I'm very Rusty but when we're out there with our brothers and our sisters doing whatever it might be you know I enjoyed listening to Luke and Paul as they talked about their hunting experiences and Luke especially talking about when he was out there with brother Wendell and brother Wendell talking about the Lord and different things and it wasn't like they had super deep conversations they weren't sitting out there you know talking about the seventh seal or whatever but it was just talking about the goodness of God and the beauty of nature that God had made or this that or the other but it was still that connection and that Fellowship going that is based around our creator the one who gave us the desire for Fellowship that's what we're fellowshipping about that's who we're fellowshipping around that's what draws us together is our desire for Fellowship pulls us back to the one who gave us that desire for Fellowship the one who started the desire for Fellowship Psalms 133 behold how good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the de of Herman and as the DW that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more how good and how pleasant is for Brethren to dwell together in unity well if we're there in unity that means we're having Fellowship we're having conversations we're connecting we're building relationships you know if you look at this ointment the incense the the special anointing oil that was created this was a recipe that was not allowed to be used for anything else okay if you were in Israel and you were caught with something that smelled close to what was at the temple you'd better be able to prove it's not the same or you were going to be killed this anointing oil was precious it was only for the temple that was the only place it could be the only ones that should smell like this were those that had been in the temple if you had been in the temple particularly as a priest when you left and walked away you would smell like you had come from there because you had been around those odors you had been in those Vapors for so long this was not something you could just pick up any anywhere this was something where you were going into the presence of God you were going into the temple that was how you got this this was not something that you went down to the corner market and bought this wasn't something that this uh oil vendor down the street carried multiple bottles of and so when the scriptures tell us that how good and how pleasant it's like the precious ointment that Unity that Fellowship is that precious it is so precious that you can only get it from one place True Fellowship only comes from God True Fellowship true Unity only comes if God's at the center of it whether that's the fellowship and relationship between a husband and wife whether that's the relationship in a congregation the only way that that actually is holding is because God's at the center of it you look at different situations Through The Years where places where there were Church splits and people got so many hurt feelings they had to go in different directions if they were holding on to just how precious that Fellowship was holding on to how precious that Unity is holding on to how precious the one who gave it to them was that's what holds a church together that's what holds a marriage together is the one who gave you that desire for Fellowship the one who gave you and created you with that desire for it if you're fellowshipping around the word if you're fellowshipping around God if you're fellowshipping around the one who gave you that desire you will be held together because God is at the center and he's the one who created it now I've said this multiple times and I'm going to keep saying it Satan hates Fellowship he wants to do everything he can to isolate you to drive you off to set you apart set you alone make you feel like you're not part of the group that you're not accepted that you're different that you're weird that you're whatever term you want to put with it he wants you to feel alone where God is sitting here and is going I want to be in fellowship with you brother Donald I want to sit down and spend time with you I want to sit down and minister to you God is going to each one of us and going hey I want some of this one-on-one time I want you to to get away with me for a little while I want you to spend time talking to just me hey with five kids my wife and I really really value anytime we can get just us to honestly at this moment we value anytime we can get where it's just us and Juniper she's kind of the age where we can't leave her behind too much but if we can get just us and her this is a good moment even if it's just running into the store we call those our Walmart dates leave the kids behind we could just go to the store for 10 minutes 15 minutes that's a great 10 minutes or 15 or whatever you know Juniper is not trying to interrupt the conversation she's just riding along so my wife and I can actually talk and that's the same way that I treasure that with my wife right now the same way that I value that is the same way that I should be valuing that time that I have with God was the ointment was special it was not something you can find everywhere and the unity and fellowship is special it's not something you find in every relationship it's not something you find in every Church body it's not something you find in every message Church body it's easy to start to take it lightly it's easy to start to take it as well this is common it's what we've always done here in Pony in the five six years I've been here it's what we always do we always get together this often we always do these many things together this is just normal so it's not a big deal if I skip it's not a big deal if I skip the lunches or it's not a big deal if I skip this or skip that because we always do them it's common Fellowship isn't common even if we're blessed to be in a church where it's something we do regularly it's not common when we look at the world it's not common the fellowship that we have with our spouses when you compare it to the kind of Fellowship the world has it's not not common the kind of relationship that you have with your children when you look at the world that's not common it's not common that a 15-year-old boy can talk to his mom about all kinds of subjects and yet that's what I get to watch at my house yeah my son talks to me too but watching him be able to walk talk to his mom and I look at the world and the way they're like my kids never talked to me I don't know anything about what's going on in their life it's like it's not common that kind of Fellowship is not common as much as we may be living in our little area and to us it starts to become common we need to take a step back and think about the blessings that we've received you know it's not common that we have this many young kids that can run up to elders and chat with them that's not common in this world you don't see little kids walk up to elders and hold conversations you don't see many Elders that would have the patience to talk to little kids like that you don't see many little kids that actually have any interest in talking to the elders these things aren't common but yet when you have God inspiring the fellowship when you have God at the center of the relationships The Uncommon becomes common it becomes the normal because this is how God works this is how God has designed us this is how God has designed the family this is how God has designed a church body to work and we enjoy how normal that is but we have to keep ourself from allowing it to become common to us and allowing it to become something that we can push to the side because it's not important I remember when we first moved over to this church building and I didn't have a lot of experiences in the other church building but I remember hearing different ones in the Cong congregation that all said I wish we had some of those same memories here I wish some of those same times that they had had pouring out their heart at that altar they like we want that here and I have had some of those here I didn't get any of those there I wasn't at that building long enough and I've had those experiences here but now I have to be on guard of going do I allow that to become common to me do I allow that fellowship with my God to become common that it's not as important to go up to the altar now because I've done it however many times it's not it's not that big a deal it's not that important for me to kneel at my Pew or it's not that important for me to do this or do that because it's a fellowship that we've done so many times and in so many ways same thing people will talk about with their spouse that their spouse can become common to them and so they're no longer trying to date their girlfriend you know it still makes me grin anytime brother W's up here and calls sister Fresa's girlfriend I'm like good that's how I want to be doing it as I continue to get older I wanted to keep being that that's my girlfriend and so I'm trying to find ways to make her smile I'm trying to find ways to make her blush I'm trying to find ways to do whatever to let her know that she still has my attention that she doesn't have to be concerned that I'm looking at any of the other women that are around or that I'm putting my attention somewhere else because she's still my focus it's the same thing between us and God we can let that relationship become common we can let that let that relationship become okay I know every morning morning I get up and I say a quick prayer to start the day you know I don't really have time Lord to be here for too long so let's let's keep this quick you know I've got a quick I can give you five minutes and then I got to be on the road to my job or to the job site or to whatever Lord I don't I don't have time this morning to read you know multiple chapters but I I can give you a verse I I can do that and get on the road hey I've been guilty I'm not I'm not pointing out at all all of you I have done that look I've even been bad enough to just get up and be like oh man I'm late and hit the road without any prayer or verses I've been there I've done that and it's easy to get wrapped up into life it's easy for the moms that their kids the kids wore her out she slept late now she got up and she's trying to get around to get everything done and she feels behind and she's so stressed out because things aren't going the way that she planned it's not going like routine normally allows man I just don't have time to pray today or I don't have time to turn on a message or I don't have time to do this or do that it happens there are days where I have rushed out of my house and I did not kiss my wife goodbye and she makes sure to text me to let me know um or she will text me later in the day and be like did you kiss me goodbye before you left sometimes I can say yeah you were sleep you just don't remember it but there are other times I'm like no I didn't it is easy to allow things to become common or to get wrapped up in business or to get wrapped up in whatever is going on it's easy for us to allow the fellowship and the relationship and the unity to become common so that it has less importance to us but in a world where Satan is doing everything he can to wreck that Satan is doing everything he can to push that apart this needs to be one of the things that we look at in our lives and go you know what I'm putting a lot of value on this the fellowship I have with my Creator the fellowship I have with my brothers and sisters this is important and if it means that I miss out on whatever okay because this is important this has value this is going to last this is going to hold me this is going to ensure that when my kids get older I still have a good relationship with them and they want to talk to me I talked to multiple people at chickf that talk about their relationship with their parents and like they want to be around they don't want them around when they are planning to come visit it's like a headache and a hassle it's more how quickly are they going to leave that's the normal in the world our normal is different our normal is I want my kids to enjoy being around me because we've had that relationship from when we were younger from when they were younger they knew they had parents that invested in them when they were younger that weren't so wrapped up in their jobs or wrapped up in their Hobbies wrapped up or whatever and I wanted to be that when I'm older that the presence of God is an old friend that I have experienced that I have been in it's not something I'm trying to search for when I'm older it's not something I'm still trying to find and I can say that because I'm growing up in the church I want this to be something that when I get older that's the normal I don't want it to be something that I'm having to hunt for and search for and be like well Lord I finally got time for you where are you [Music] God calls us to Fellowship because that was the desire that he had and so it's the desire that he placed in every one of us I'm going to do something a little bit different for me and hopefully brother wend will forgive me for this but I'd like to to copy brother Wendell for a moment i' like everybody to stand up and let's form one of our circles everyone circle around get your hands together everyone's I'm gonna one more quote in the mystery of revealed brother says one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it you stay right loving sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman orever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among one or talk make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another brother Nathaniel go ahead and come on down you can leave the the camera sitting on an empty spot if you need to and I know my wife's out there with Silas go ahead and bring bring him in if I need to I'll hold silus if they'll go ahead and come in this isn't something that we should take lightly even these moments being able to do this this is one of those where it's kind of common for our church I I mean I've seen brother wend do this so many times where we all gather together and sometimes we're in the mood to do it sometimes we're like oh he's doing it again but yeah this isn't even these are not moments that we should take lightly being able to gather together being able to hold one another's hands being able to to pray together and being able to just look across the circle and know I'm not alone however much God may have been what s I'm sorry however much Satan may have been hitting me all week and trying to make me feel s separate and trying to make me feel alone and cut off there are brothers and sisters all around me and there are brothers and sisters across from me we're just waiting a moment my my wife's coming out right now I think I caught her mid diaper change come here syus come on buddy this is this is not something that we take lightly this isn't something that we cre as being simple God created us because he had a desire for Fellowship God created us in His image so we have that same desire for fellowship and in a world that is so focused on your own self-care self-gratification fulfilling my own desires whatever it might be God is calling us and reminding us that he wants us to fellowship with him and he wants us to fellowship with our brothers and sisters Satan wants to drive us apart but God is calling us to be together I just want to take a moment to to pray like this and then brother Wendell can say whatever he feels he should say as we are dismissing Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we just Lord we thank you for your presence Lord Lord we thank you that Lord that you had a desire to fellowship with each one of us Lord Lord not only did you create us but Lord you went and then you paid the price to redeem us and bring us back lord you shed your blood so that my sins could be washed away so that I could be lifted up into your presence Lord Lord I Lord help us to not take that lightly Lord Lord my brothers and sisters that are all gathered here with me Lord I Lord help me not to to take them for granted Lord and help them not to become common to me Lord but Lord help me to have that desire to to fellowship with them Lord to love them to to share our licks of fire back and forth Lord You Lord you you said not to forsake gathering together even as we see the end time approaching and Lord we know it can't be far Lord help us to to stoke that desire Lord to to be with your children Lord to be with our brothers and sisters to be in your presence Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would forgive us of the many times we take it for granted Lord Lord all the times that all the times I looked at my Bible and then rushed out the door instead of reading it Lord forgive me forgive me for not focusing on that fellowship with you like I should Lord I pray you would just Lord bless my brothers and sisters here Lord I pray that you would Lord if any of them have felt alone Lord if any of them have felt separated if any of them have felt apart Lord I pray that you would Lord put them on my heart put them on another brother or sister's heart that we would just reach out that we would send that text make that phone call maybe if we're close enough just drive over and say hi Lord we thank you for this body that you've placed here in in P Lord I Thank you for my brothers and sisters Lord Lord I pray that you would just strengthen each one of us that you would draw each one of us closer to you Lord Lord that you would just help us to have fellowship and value that Fellowship more than we ever have before Lord we don't want to allow ourselves to be pushed off into isolation by the tricks of the devil lord I want to be in your presence I want to be in fellowship with my brothers and sisters and Lord I want to be there helping to protect and fight for my brothers and sisters Lord we just thank you for your spirit Lord we thank you for your presence Lord we just love you thank you Lord Jesus thank you e e e e e e e e e for
