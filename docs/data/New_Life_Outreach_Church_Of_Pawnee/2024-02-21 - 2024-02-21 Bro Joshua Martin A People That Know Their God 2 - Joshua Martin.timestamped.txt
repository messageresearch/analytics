[33:28] but Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[33:30] would not defile himself with a portion
[33:32] of King's meat nor with the wine which
[33:35] he drank therefore he requested of the
[33:38] prince of the Unix that he might not
[33:40] defile himself now God had brought
[33:42] Daniel into favor and tender love with
[33:45] the prince of the Unix and the prince of
[33:47] the Unix said unto Daniel I fear my Lord
[33:50] the King which hath appointed your meat
[33:52] and your drink for why should he see
[33:54] your faces and worse liken than the
[33:57] children which are of your sword and
[33:59] then shall ye make me in danger of my
[34:02] head to the king then said Daniel to
[34:04] melzar whom the prince of the Unix had
[34:06] said over Daniel hananiah Mel and
[34:09] Azariah prove thy servants I beseech
[34:12] thee 10 days let them give us pulse to
[34:15] eat water to drink then let our
[34:17] countenances be looked upon before thee
[34:20] and the countenance of the children that
[34:22] ate of the portion of the king's meat as
[34:24] thou see us deal with thy servants so he
[34:26] can see Ed to them in this matter and
[34:28] prove them 10 days and at the end of the
[34:31] 10 days their countenances appeared
[34:33] fairer and fatter in flesh and all the
[34:35] children which did eat the portion of
[34:37] King's meat th melzar took away the
[34:40] portion of their meat and the wine that
[34:42] they should drink and gave them pulse as
[34:44] for these four children God gave them
[34:47] knowledge and skill and all learning and
[34:49] wisdom and Daniel had understanding and
[34:51] all visions and dreams now at the end of
[34:54] the days that the king had said he
[34:56] should bring them in then the prince of
[34:58] the unic brought them in before
[35:00] Nebuchadnezzar and the king communed
[35:02] with him among them all was found none
[35:04] like Daniel hananiah Mel Azariah
[35:08] therefore stood they before the king and
[35:11] all manners of wisdom and understanding
[35:13] that the king inquired of them he found
[35:15] them 10 times better than all the
[35:18] magicians the astrologers that were all
[35:20] in his realm my what a testimony amen
[35:24] Daniel
[35:25] 11:32 and said as do wickedly against
[35:28] the Covenant shall he corrupt by
[35:29] flatteries but the people that do know
[35:32] their God shall be strong and do
[35:34] exploits amen you may be seated tonight
[35:37] like I said I'm just going to continue
[35:39] on my my thought on the people that know
[35:41] their God and we see that it was the
[35:44] favor of God that would separate these
[35:46] boys from the rest of the Kingdom they
[35:48] was the Covenant people they didn't
[35:50] choose themselves but God had chose them
[35:52] and since there was favor among them
[35:55] there was understanding that was was
[35:56] brought to them and that understanding
[35:59] would set them apart from the rest of
[36:01] the children and the Bible would say in
[36:03] Daniel 921 yay while I was speaking in
[36:06] prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had
[36:09] seen in the vision at the beginning
[36:11] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[36:13] about the time of the evening ablation
[36:16] and he informed me and talked with me
[36:19] and said oh Daniel I am now come forth
[36:22] to give thee skill and understanding at
[36:24] the beginning of thy supplications the
[36:26] commandment come forth and I have come
[36:28] down to show thee and and I love this
[36:30] part of the scripture for thou were
[36:32] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[36:35] matter and consider the vision the angel
[36:39] says I am come forth to give thee skill
[36:41] and understanding for thou are greatly
[36:44] beloved and since your beloved therefore
[36:47] understand and that word beloved means
[36:48] greatly loved and dear to the heart and
[36:51] so since Daniel was dear to the heart of
[36:53] God there was understanding that was
[36:56] brought to him cuz not everybody was
[36:58] visited by an Angel not everybody had a
[37:00] visitation but since there was a favoris
[37:04] over Daniel there was an understanding
[37:06] that was brought to them and I think my
[37:08] in this generation since we are favored
[37:11] among all of the other people we are we
[37:13] are dear to the heart of God we have
[37:15] been separated by understanding not by a
[37:18] head knowledge not by an intellectual
[37:20] conception but we've got an
[37:22] understanding in this generation that
[37:24] has separated us from the rest of the
[37:26] world and brother Brandon would say this
[37:28] now when mckz was on Earth he was
[37:31] nothing in the world but the Jehovah God
[37:33] made manifest by creation he was here
[37:36] like in a theophany Abraham met him once
[37:38] in his tent and we said this morning
[37:41] Abraham recognized him and he told
[37:43] Abraham what he was going to do because
[37:46] he was not going to leave the air of the
[37:48] world blind to the things that he was
[37:51] going to do may I stop here for a minute
[37:54] to say God still has the same opin
[37:56] opinion about his church you're not
[37:59] children of Darkness you're children of
[38:01] light and and and we who blessed are the
[38:04] meek for they shall inherit the earth
[38:06] and with God who acted to Abraham who
[38:10] was to inherit the earth and he would
[38:12] say I will not keep these things back
[38:14] from the man that is going to inherit
[38:16] the earth how much more will he reveal a
[38:19] secrets to his church that is going to
[38:22] inherit the earth and I thought that is
[38:25] amazing God says I'm not going to hide
[38:27] anything from Abraham because he's going
[38:30] to inherit the earth and brother Brandon
[38:32] would say what about the now the
[38:34] spiritual seed that is going to inherit
[38:36] the earth not because of a of a blood
[38:39] lineage but because of a supernatural
[38:41] lineage how much more is God going to
[38:44] reveal a secret understanding to that
[38:48] generation to that group of people so
[38:50] that's what it's going to separate the
[38:53] two groups is knowing their God by a
[38:55] revelation knowing their God by
[38:58] understanding this group is beloved
[39:00] they're loved by God you see Genesis
[39:03] 12:1 would say now the Lord had said
[39:05] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[39:08] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[39:10] Father's House unto a land I will show
[39:13] thee and I will make thee a great nation
[39:16] and I will bless thee and make thy name
[39:18] great and thou shalt be a blessing so
[39:21] Abraham's visitation wasn't to just call
[39:24] him out wasn't just to to bring standing
[39:27] but it was to call him out to produce
[39:29] exploits and I don't believe we're just
[39:32] here on Earth to to be called a message
[39:34] believer to say we believe Malachi for
[39:37] but I believe we're on Earth with a
[39:39] greater purpose than that we're not on
[39:41] Earth to fill up Pew but we're on on
[39:43] Earth to produce exploits the actions of
[39:46] Faith the actions of the Supernatural
[39:49] and that's what God was telling Abraham
[39:51] I am separating you I'm calling you out
[39:54] from your Kindred I'm calling you out
[39:56] from from your Homeland and I am going
[39:58] to make thee a great nation in other
[40:01] words this separation is going to bring
[40:04] a covenant and this Covenant is going to
[40:07] bring forth exploits and I think my God
[40:09] has given us a message in this
[40:11] generation that is separated a people
[40:14] that was called by his grace and it's
[40:16] producing the exploits of Faith it's
[40:19] producing the Supernatural and their
[40:22] everyday walk you see the people of the
[40:24] world is wanting a living God but right
[40:27] here in the midst of a chaotic time
[40:30] there was somebody that is beloved and
[40:32] is producing exploits oh Hallelujah so
[40:36] this visitation upon Abraham was God's
[40:39] favor upon Abraham brother Brandon would
[40:41] say now the first thing I want you to
[40:44] know that when God in Genesis 12 caught
[40:46] Abraham it was by elction it wasn't
[40:49] because Abraham was good it wasn't
[40:51] because Abraham deserved it and I think
[40:54] I'm so thankful it's not because we're
[40:56] good it's not because we deserve it but
[40:59] it's because we're close we're dear to
[41:01] the heart of God we come from his mind
[41:04] and brother Brandon will continue on to
[41:06] say it it was because God chose Abraham
[41:10] not Abraham choosing God it was God
[41:13] choosing Abraham and that's the way he
[41:15] calls the seed too now you not not what
[41:18] you want to be not him that willth or
[41:21] him that runneth but God that showeth
[41:23] Mercy is that scripture certainly it's
[41:26] not what you want to be it's what God
[41:29] chose you to be and I think my when we
[41:31] was running from the grace of God we
[41:34] didn't want nothing to do with with
[41:36] Christianity or the the life of a
[41:38] Christian you know he still called us he
[41:40] still chose us not because we wanted it
[41:43] to be but God chose us to be and it's
[41:46] not because we deserved it but it's
[41:48] because we are beloved it and once you
[41:51] realize you are beloved you realize you
[41:53] are called for a purpose and the Bible
[41:56] tell us I heard another voice from
[41:57] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[42:00] and be ye not partakers of her sins and
[42:03] you receive not of her plagues and so
[42:06] there there there's exploits that the
[42:08] world is producing they're producing
[42:11] sins and they're and they're receiving
[42:12] plagues but at the same time there's
[42:15] another group that is not partaking of
[42:17] their exploits but they're taking on the
[42:20] Supernatural and is producing the life
[42:23] of Jesus Christ there was an
[42:25] understanding that has called The Bride
[42:27] out of a church and plac them in the
[42:30] Supernatural you see like I said about
[42:32] Lazarus the last time because he was in
[42:35] a grave he lost all of his inheritance
[42:38] he lost everything that was rightfully
[42:40] his but the same voice the C his
[42:42] identity back to him restored him to all
[42:45] of his possessions it was because he was
[42:48] favored oh come on now not because of
[42:51] his name not because of his wealth not
[42:53] because of what he could achieve but
[42:56] because he was favored that brought the
[42:58] voice of Resurrection to his tomb and
[43:01] brought him back to his identity and his
[43:04] rightful inheritance and this the
[43:06] message has brought an understanding
[43:08] that I'm not meant for a tomb I'm not
[43:10] meant for a cemetery I'm meant to be
[43:12] brought to my true identity and with
[43:15] that identity becomes exploits with that
[43:19] identity comes the supernatural oh my
[43:22] but you see it's an understanding of who
[43:25] we are you know if you never understand
[43:27] who you are you're never going to
[43:29] understand what is yours you're never
[43:31] going to understand what belongs to you
[43:33] and you know I I remember growing up and
[43:35] just to tell a tell a quick story on
[43:37] Caleb I remember growing up and Caleb
[43:39] was always telling me I was adopted and
[43:41] you know and that really messed with my
[43:43] mind I thought I was adopted he said I
[43:45] they picked me up on the side of the
[43:46] road you know and I was growing up as a
[43:48] little kid and I thinking I belonged not
[43:51] thinking that that that I was loved and
[43:53] because of that second guessing in my
[43:56] mind I didn't realize I had a father
[43:59] that loved me you see what I'm talking
[44:01] about if you never understand that God
[44:03] has called you in this generation and
[44:06] loves you you you got a position inside
[44:09] of the Kingdom you're never going to
[44:11] rise to your full potential and if the
[44:14] devil can keep you from making this
[44:16] message God's favor on you you'll never
[44:18] see who you really are but this message
[44:21] is your true identity I'm not just the
[44:24] heir of one the Martin but I'm the care
[44:26] of Jesus Christ and everything that
[44:28] Christ had belongs to me and you see God
[44:31] seen me before I was ever in a fallen
[44:34] State God seen me in my true position
[44:37] you see why did Jesus say to Nathaniel
[44:40] and in John 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel
[44:43] coming to him and he and saith un saith
[44:45] of him behold an Israelite indeed in
[44:48] whom is no gal and Nathaniel said unto
[44:51] him whence knowest thou me and Jesus
[44:54] answered and said unto him before that
[44:56] philli called thee when thou was under
[44:58] the tree I saw thee and so before
[45:01] Nathaniel ever had a chance to come in
[45:05] contact with the supernatural God had
[45:07] already saw him before he was ever
[45:10] called by a minister before a preacher
[45:12] ever got up and and preached a sermon
[45:15] before you ever heard a message before
[45:18] you ever realized your position God
[45:21] already saw you and oh my that's a
[45:23] revelation that this message has brought
[45:26] to us that I wasn't I didn't become seed
[45:29] at the new birth I was already a son and
[45:31] since I was already a son there was a
[45:34] calling to me oh Hallelujah I don't
[45:37] believe that Philip went to Nathaniel by
[45:39] accident but he was led by the spirit to
[45:41] philli or to Nathaniel saying come on
[45:44] come see the Messiah it was because God
[45:47] already saw him that there was somebody
[45:49] else that was willing to spread the
[45:51] gospel and oh my every time the fivefold
[45:54] ministry get sits up and preaches a
[45:56] message preaches a word teaches a word
[45:59] and there's somebody receiving it it's
[46:02] because God already saw you before the
[46:04] foundation of the world before the
[46:06] addictions before the Fallen State
[46:09] before all the things you went through
[46:11] God already saw you and since he saw you
[46:15] he gave you an opportunity to receive an
[46:18] understanding oh my and that
[46:21] understanding is to produce exploits you
[46:23] see what did Jesus tell him he in John
[46:26] 1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him
[46:29] because I said unto thee I saw thee
[46:31] under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou
[46:34] shalt see greater things than these in
[46:37] other words I'm not just revealing to
[46:39] you that I always knew you but because
[46:42] of that understanding you're going to
[46:44] see exploits and oh this message didn't
[46:46] just bring us the Revelation it brought
[46:49] us the superatural it brought us the
[46:51] power of the resurrection and it's more
[46:54] than just it's more than just a head
[46:55] knowledge it's a reality in every one of
[46:58] our Lives you see brother Brandon would
[47:00] say this they say the days of Miracles
[47:03] has passed and all of these things let
[47:05] them prove it I'll give you an
[47:06] everlasting sign the super sign oh yes
[47:09] now he could have come an angel he could
[47:12] have come in whatever he wished to but
[47:14] he choose to come as Abraham's seed amen
[47:17] Abraham's super seed that's right that
[47:20] way he come that CH he chose to come to
[47:22] show in this last day God's Super Signs
[47:26] a super race oh yes not what you call a
[47:28] super race but what God calls a super
[47:31] race because they got what the
[47:33] supernatural power with Supernatural SS
[47:36] through a supernatural belief in a
[47:39] supernatural word he is saying what is
[47:41] bringing this Supernatural what is
[47:44] raising up a super race is a
[47:46] supernatural belief in a supernatural
[47:49] word this understanding that we got in
[47:52] this generation is the supernatural that
[47:55] is going to change our bodies one day
[47:57] that is going to change and it's
[47:59] changing our likes today or dislikes
[48:02] it's changing as the moing us into the
[48:05] image that he had before us oh remember
[48:08] that image he saw before the world began
[48:10] and he saw you this the message is
[48:12] shaping us into that image hallelujah
[48:16] it's the supernatural that has come with
[48:19] the supernatural word and he continues
[48:22] on to say from a through a supernatural
[48:24] belief in a supernatural word from a
[48:27] supernatural God he says you talk about
[48:29] super woo Supernatural God in a
[48:32] supernatural body in a natural people
[48:35] giving Supernatural signs Hallelujah a
[48:39] super race they that know their God
[48:41] shall do exploits great exploits show
[48:44] Supernatural signs of people Abraham's
[48:48] seed oh my and I love how brother
[48:50] Brandon puts it he says they say the
[48:52] days of Miracles as passed and he says
[48:55] let let them prove it he says if they
[48:57] say the Miracles was passed let them
[48:59] prove it and brother Brandon would say
[49:01] in another place the greatest Miracle is
[49:04] a life that has been transformed you see
[49:06] the world can the the greatest
[49:08] theologians the greatest atheists can
[49:11] debate scripture they can debate the
[49:13] message they can debate and say the
[49:15] cloud never happened that the pillar of
[49:17] fire didn't appear over brother
[49:19] brandom's head that it's idolatry to
[49:21] have a picture up and things like that
[49:23] they can try to disprove those things
[49:25] but the greatest Miracle the greatest
[49:28] Paradox the greatest exploits that
[49:31] Christ has on the Earth today is the
[49:34] supernatural inside of a vessel inside
[49:37] of a body let them debate pictures let
[49:40] them debate quotes let them debate
[49:42] scripture but they cannot debate a life
[49:45] that has been changed by a supernatural
[49:47] belief in a supernatural word that has
[49:50] come to a supernatural race let them say
[49:53] what they want to let them say this the
[49:55] this Prophet is false but it's changed
[49:57] our life it's changed New Life
[49:59] outreaches his life and and it's
[50:01] Authority oh come on now you knew where
[50:04] you was before this message came to you
[50:07] you knew where you was you was a drunk
[50:09] you was an alcoholic you was an addict
[50:11] you was a blasphemer whatever you was
[50:13] but the supernatural word had come to a
[50:16] people that was dear to the heart of God
[50:19] to bring forth exploits to bring forth a
[50:22] life that the devil don't know what to
[50:24] do with
[50:26] hallelujah oh it's the greatest Miracle
[50:29] they they they can't debate that oh how
[50:32] let him say what they want to but
[50:34] there's something that's happened inside
[50:36] of the life of the believer and brother
[50:39] Brandon would say the word the evening
[50:40] message must carry evening results oh
[50:44] that's plain and simple must carry
[50:46] evening results so the bride that God
[50:49] had in his mind that was spotless and
[50:51] blameless an invincible Army Marching In
[50:53] step and If This Were word has come to
[50:56] get his condition for that Vision
[50:59] there's nothing the devil can do to keep
[51:01] this evening message from producing the
[51:04] results that God had in his mind oh let
[51:07] him try let him say what they want to
[51:10] but something that's quickened on the
[51:12] inside of the believer it's the results
[51:14] of the word inside of a life it's the
[51:17] greatest miracle that is upon the Earth
[51:19] today hallelujah it's the evening
[51:22] message the the the supernatural word
[51:24] inside of a body producing the
[51:28] exploits oh it's not a gift it's not a
[51:30] personality it's the word hallelujah
[51:33] brother Brandon would say continue on
[51:36] that the evening message must sow
[51:38] evening seed not morning seed evening
[51:40] seed is that right midday scene the
[51:43] seeds back there was the nomination it
[51:46] died it perished but evening time
[51:48] message was show evening timeline and
[51:51] will show evening time results the
[51:53] evening message and he says Jesus time
[51:56] midday message showed midday results the
[51:59] beginning message uh uh showed beginning
[52:02] results made creation he he made his son
[52:05] in his own image the in the midday the
[52:07] evening time he makes a bride forward
[52:10] see by what his word how did he form the
[52:13] Earth he spoke it into existence by the
[52:16] word and so how is this coming to B how
[52:19] was it coming to pass by the word
[52:22] hallelujah brother Brandon would say in
[52:23] another place after 2,000 years the
[52:26] critics that try to put him to death
[52:28] down there is trying to do the same
[52:30] thing today but the same signs the same
[52:33] Supernatural sign still shows amongst
[52:36] Supernatural
[52:37] people it still shows amongst
[52:39] Supernatural people come on now if they
[52:42] can't see this message is because
[52:43] they're not called to it if they can't
[52:45] see this word inside of the Bride
[52:47] they're not called to it if they're
[52:49] putting the Greater Works upon the
[52:51] prophet they're not Supernatural enough
[52:54] to see it but I'm called by a
[52:55] supernatural Grace to have the Greater
[52:58] Works not in Malachi 4 but inside of the
[53:01] Bride she's producing the Greater Works
[53:04] a teenager is producing the Greater
[53:07] Works a young boy young girl is
[53:09] producing the supernatural side and he
[53:12] continues on to say which is the Seed of
[53:14] Abraham amen I feel good amen
[53:17] Supernatural you don't believe in
[53:19] Supernatural how can you believe in God
[53:22] Supernatural born by a supernatural
[53:24] birth by a supernatural power he says
[53:27] talk about super oh and in that message
[53:30] is super sign and it's a powerful
[53:32] message he talks about everything is
[53:34] super he says you don't you no longer
[53:36] have the little the little grocery
[53:38] stores but you got the supermarket he
[53:40] says we don't got the little highways
[53:42] but we got a super highway of five Lanes
[53:44] going each Direction he says the America
[53:47] built a super ship and says God itself
[53:50] can't even sink it and God put the
[53:52] Titanic at the bottom of the ocean he
[53:54] says Rel living in the time of super
[53:57] everything's super Russia thinks they're
[53:58] super but at the same time there's a
[54:01] supernatural people that don't think
[54:03] they're super they know they're super
[54:05] not what they can do but a supernatural
[54:08] belief in a supernatural word is
[54:11] performing the life of Jesus Christ oh
[54:14] man we can't help it we're just called
[54:16] to it you see brother Brandon would say
[54:19] and when Daniel saw a vision of that he
[54:21] said though they that and though they do
[54:23] wicked and shall do wicked in the last
[54:25] days but they that know their God shall
[54:27] do exploits in the last days speaking of
[54:30] this time know what know what exploits
[54:32] is exploits of faith will perform signs
[54:36] and wonders so they that do wickedly
[54:39] can't help but do wicked but the people
[54:41] that has called to this can't help but
[54:43] do it you see and I like how the Bible
[54:46] puts it in my opening scripture the
[54:48] Bible says Daniel purposed in his heart
[54:50] that he would not be defiled in other
[54:53] words he's seen some things that he can
[54:54] make changes on and then he purposed in
[54:57] his heart but then the Bible would say
[55:00] he requested of the prince of the Unix
[55:03] that he might not be defiled and that
[55:05] distruct me when I read that he didn't
[55:07] just keep it in his heart but then he
[55:09] started to make changes he put it into
[55:12] action and says the word I'm putting in
[55:15] my heart I'm purposing my heart but I
[55:18] know the word is going to contradict
[55:20] some actions it's going to contradict
[55:23] some things I'm eating here and he
[55:25] requested he put it into action and says
[55:28] the way I'm living I'm not doing anymore
[55:30] and I think my that should be our desire
[55:33] I'm not just going to put the message in
[55:35] my heart it belongs there but I'm going
[55:37] to put it on the outside as well I'm
[55:40] going to request if I need to go to
[55:42] friends and say I'm not talking like
[55:44] that anymore I'm going to make things
[55:46] right if I need to delete music I'm
[55:48] going to delete music if I need to
[55:50] delete pictures off my phone I'm going
[55:52] to delete those pictures it's not just
[55:55] staying in my heart but I'm going to
[55:57] request I'm put it in putting it into
[56:00] action that is the exploits in other
[56:03] words I'm not just keeping it here but
[56:05] I'm putting it here hallelujah he took
[56:08] the convictions on the inside that
[56:11] understanding brought then brought it on
[56:13] the outside and what I love about that
[56:15] is he started a bargain he says okay let
[56:19] our countenance let our countenance
[56:21] determine what we're doing right if
[56:23] we're doing it right or if they're doing
[56:25] it right and I think man that's the
[56:27] confidence of the believer okay let
[56:29] let's have a showdown you do what you're
[56:31] doing we'll do what we're doing and let
[56:33] our countenance let our exploits let the
[56:37] actions of Faith determine if this
[56:39] message is right or if your Creed is
[56:41] right oh I think if there's ever a group
[56:43] on the earth that is has a countenance
[56:46] that is liken un to the word it is the
[56:49] message of the hour if there's a young
[56:51] people that has the countenance of Jesus
[56:54] Christ here is this
[56:56] message oh man the Bible would tell us
[56:58] in Proverbs 15-13 a marry heart maketh a
[57:02] cheerful countenance so it all starts
[57:04] with the heart but you got to let the
[57:06] heart Express itself on the outside you
[57:10] see I read this last time brother
[57:11] Brandon would say now he has cried out
[57:13] in this last agage you have the word you
[57:16] have more Bibles than ever but you're
[57:17] not doing anything about the word except
[57:20] dividing it hacking into into pieces
[57:23] taking what you want leaving out what
[57:24] you don't want you were not interested
[57:27] in living it he is saying we don't want
[57:29] to I don't want to argue and to our
[57:31] preachers have gotten a and got that in
[57:33] their mind that the only reason they
[57:35] study is to argue and that's not the
[57:37] case brother brandom is saying you have
[57:39] the word you have more Bibles you have
[57:41] more the yeah you have everything right
[57:43] here but you're not interested in the
[57:45] exploits you're not interested in the
[57:47] word you see convictions can have strong
[57:50] arguments but I don't want to have
[57:52] strong arguments I want to have strong
[57:54] exploits hope this is making sense
[57:56] tonight I want to have what's on the
[57:58] inside coming on the outside you see and
[58:01] the Bible would tell us in John 15 and
[58:03] 16 you have not chosen me but I have
[58:06] chosen you and ordained you that you
[58:08] should go forth and bring forth fruits
[58:11] and that your fruit should remain that's
[58:14] whatsoever you should ask of my father
[58:17] in my name he may give it to you and I
[58:20] just love that he did he didn't just
[58:22] choose us but he ordained us and the
[58:25] word ordained means to appoint the set
[58:28] so he didn't just he didn't just choose
[58:29] us to put us on a Pew but he chose us
[58:32] and ordained us appointed us unto
[58:35] exploits appointed us under good works
[58:38] that those Works should remain and and
[58:42] just bear with me a few seconds here he
[58:44] links the good fruit and the third P
[58:46] together and you see many people get in
[58:48] their mind that exploits is the
[58:51] supernatural exploits is the spoken word
[58:54] and that comes with it but he is saying
[58:56] here don't be worried about speaking the
[58:59] word be worried about living the word he
[59:02] says and orain you that you should go
[59:04] forth and bring forth fruit that your
[59:06] fruit should remain that whatsoever you
[59:09] ask that's the third pole that's the
[59:12] spoken word but exploits ain't always
[59:14] the spoken word exploits is a young
[59:17] person living the word that's exploits
[59:20] exploits is the word coming inside of a
[59:23] m and prod producing the life of Jesus
[59:26] Christ to her children exploits is the
[59:29] Life coming in a daddy and going to work
[59:32] and producing fruit and the fruit is
[59:35] remaining not here today and gone
[59:37] tomorrow that's not what the Bible is
[59:39] saying but he called you and appointed
[59:42] you that your good works should remain
[59:46] oh man so the life of this word is
[59:48] bringing ain't just for today but it's
[59:50] for tomorrow and the same life that is
[59:53] there tomorrow is going going to be with
[59:55] us all the way to the coming of the Lord
[59:58] oh Hallelujah but you see many people
[1:00:01] think since they since they've never
[1:00:03] spoken tongues they've never seen a
[1:00:04] vision they've never prophesied that
[1:00:07] they're not producing exploits but
[1:00:09] exploits is the Life coming inside of
[1:00:11] the believer you see in the Bible would
[1:00:13] tell us in Ephesians 2 and8 by grace are
[1:00:17] you saved through faith not of yourself
[1:00:19] it is the gift of God not of Works lest
[1:00:22] any man lest any man should both for we
[1:00:25] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:00:28] Jesus unto good works for God hath
[1:00:31] before ordained or appointed that we
[1:00:34] should walk in them and so he's telling
[1:00:37] us here we're not saved by works but
[1:00:40] once we are saved we become his
[1:00:42] workmanship and we are we are appointed
[1:00:45] unto good works that he has for ordain
[1:00:48] for us to walk in and you know that just
[1:00:51] struck me that we're walking in them it
[1:00:54] it's flesh taking on the life of God and
[1:00:57] walking in it not professing it not
[1:00:59] confessing it but we're walking in them
[1:01:02] you see the Bible would tell us in First
[1:01:04] Peter uh 2 and9 but you are a chosen
[1:01:07] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:01:10] nation of peculiar people that you
[1:01:12] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:01:15] hath called you and the like how
[1:01:17] scoffield puts it he describes the word
[1:01:20] Praises as virtues or excellencies and
[1:01:23] as I read that you know that just and
[1:01:25] and I love definitions you know that
[1:01:27] just really stood out to me you're a
[1:01:30] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:01:33] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[1:01:35] should show forth the virtues of him who
[1:01:38] hath called you oh man if you ever get
[1:01:41] that Revelation that we're not just
[1:01:43] predestinated to be predestinated but
[1:01:45] we're predestinated to have the
[1:01:48] attributes of God on manif on display
[1:01:52] the same attributes that was in the of
[1:01:54] God is the same virtues that is inside
[1:01:58] of the Bride
[1:02:00] hallelujah oh man so since we are called
[1:02:03] to show forth it we are showing forth
[1:02:05] the virtues you see brother Brandon
[1:02:07] going say the True Church of Jesus
[1:02:09] Christ the bride is liken to pure gold
[1:02:12] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:02:14] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:02:17] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:02:21] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[1:02:25] she is to manifest oh man so that takes
[1:02:28] the pressure off of me and puts it upon
[1:02:30] the word that I'm not trying to manifest
[1:02:33] it I'm just reflecting what is what is
[1:02:35] inside of this word you remember brother
[1:02:37] brandom talks about the do and he says
[1:02:39] you wake up early in the morning and
[1:02:41] there's Dew on the ground and he says
[1:02:42] it's reflecting and sparkling and it's
[1:02:45] really pretty but it's not the Dee it's
[1:02:47] just reflecting the beauty of the sun
[1:02:50] it's reflecting another power and oh man
[1:02:53] we are his virtues we're his attributes
[1:02:55] we're his life and it's not because of
[1:02:58] us we're just reflecting the life of the
[1:03:01] word hallelujah and he continues on to
[1:03:04] say there was no fault in her she has
[1:03:07] she is all glorious within and without
[1:03:10] from beginning to ending she is the work
[1:03:12] of her Lord all of his works are perfect
[1:03:16] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:03:18] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:03:21] purpose of God oh man that's just
[1:03:24] powerful in her is summed up and
[1:03:27] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:03:30] purpose of God the true church the the
[1:03:33] the true bride her righteousness is his
[1:03:36] righteousness oh man and you see
[1:03:39] remember what what is the second the
[1:03:41] second fold of the three-fold purpose it
[1:03:43] was God in Christ and then God inside of
[1:03:46] the believer and and having the
[1:03:49] preeminence and you see the Bible would
[1:03:51] tell us in second Peter 1:16 for we we
[1:03:54] have not followed cting the device
[1:03:56] fables but when we when we made known
[1:03:59] unto you the power and the coming of our
[1:04:01] Lord Jesus Christ but we're eyewitnesses
[1:04:04] of his majesty and so he says we're not
[1:04:07] just following device fables we're not
[1:04:09] just following something in our
[1:04:11] imagination that ain't true but we're I
[1:04:14] Witnesses of his majesty and can anybody
[1:04:17] say that tonight we're not just
[1:04:19] following a prophet but we're
[1:04:21] eyewitnesses of the authority that lays
[1:04:24] inside of this word hallelujah and we're
[1:04:28] just we're just experiencing and
[1:04:30] reflecting the power of this message
[1:04:33] we're seeing evening time results and
[1:04:36] you see the Bible would tell us in
[1:04:37] Revelation 17- 14 hope this is okay
[1:04:40] tonight Revelation
[1:04:42] 17-4 and they shall make war with the
[1:04:45] lamb and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:04:47] for he is the Lord of lords and king of
[1:04:50] kings and they that are with him are
[1:04:53] called chosen
[1:04:54] and faithful oh man so he's saying the
[1:04:57] Lamb's going to overcome but he's not
[1:04:59] the only one that's overcoming but he
[1:05:01] has a called elect he has a Chosen Few
[1:05:04] that is faithful oh man that means I'm
[1:05:07] faithful in my calling if he seen me
[1:05:09] faithful then I'm going to remain
[1:05:11] faithful now if I overcome then I'm
[1:05:14] overcoming now Hallelujah I'm overcoming
[1:05:18] now it don't matter how hot the world is
[1:05:20] getting how you it amazes me there when
[1:05:23] Daniel whenever the three Hebrew boys is
[1:05:26] about to be thrown into to the fiery
[1:05:28] furnace number one and we've heard that
[1:05:30] as the children growing up number one
[1:05:32] the furnace was seven times harder but I
[1:05:34] never caught this I guess but the Bible
[1:05:36] would say in Daniel 3 and 20 and he
[1:05:39] commanded the most mighty man that was
[1:05:41] in his army he didn't just skip the
[1:05:43] weaklings but he got the most Mighty Man
[1:05:46] into the army the most Mighty Warriors
[1:05:49] and say hey bind them bind them and
[1:05:52] throw them into the furnace and I think
[1:05:54] man the devil didn't just send the
[1:05:55] scraps he didn't just send the worst but
[1:05:58] he said he got this most Mighty Man and
[1:06:00] says go and bind them but oh the devil
[1:06:03] didn't realize Nebuchadnezzar didn't
[1:06:05] realize you might bind them now but
[1:06:08] there's an understanding that has been
[1:06:10] poured out though if we don't bow God's
[1:06:13] going to save us anyways and with that
[1:06:15] understanding come the Fourth Man in the
[1:06:18] fire and loose their bounds and oh man
[1:06:20] the devil may try to crank up the heat
[1:06:22] he may send his Gra
[1:06:24] he may send pornography he may send
[1:06:27] gossip but there's an understanding
[1:06:29] inside of this bride that I'm not bowing
[1:06:32] my knee to any image I'm not bowing to
[1:06:34] any addiction but there's an authority
[1:06:37] that comes with understanding oh the lid
[1:06:40] of hell has been released in this age
[1:06:43] and brother Brandon would say all of
[1:06:44] hell has been loosed in this generation
[1:06:47] but at the same time all of Heaven has
[1:06:50] been poured out to the believer oh it
[1:06:52] ain't hopeless that there's still
[1:06:54] exploits in the midst of a chaotic time
[1:06:58] there were still exploits and you know
[1:07:00] and as you look around and sometimes it
[1:07:02] gets it gets discouraging because
[1:07:04] they're you you see a lot of Hypocrites
[1:07:06] you see a lot of naysayers you see a lot
[1:07:09] of lot of blasphemers turning away from
[1:07:11] the message and you wonder Lord is there
[1:07:13] really is there really somebody rising
[1:07:16] to the occasion and you know and and and
[1:07:18] I read this the other day in Romans 11:3
[1:07:21] and the Bible would say Lord this is
[1:07:22] Elijah Lord they killed thy prophets Dig
[1:07:25] Down thine altars and I am left alone
[1:07:28] and they seek my life oh man have you
[1:07:30] ever felt that way that Lord Oh all the
[1:07:33] Mighty Men of the devil is after me I
[1:07:35] feel I got I got a mind battle after
[1:07:37] mind battle after mind battle Am I by
[1:07:40] myself I don't feel like I have anybody
[1:07:42] to talk to I don't feel like I have
[1:07:44] anybody to confide in and then the Lord
[1:07:47] would say but what sayith the answer of
[1:07:49] God unto him I have reserved to myself
[1:07:52] 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to
[1:07:56] the image of Bell in other words Elijah
[1:07:59] you're not by yourself there is still
[1:08:01] some men there is still a generation
[1:08:04] there's still masam there's still
[1:08:06] daddies there's still young people that
[1:08:08] is not bowing their knee to pornography
[1:08:11] not bowing their knee to the pleasures
[1:08:13] of the world I have an elected people
[1:08:16] that is standing with exploits they know
[1:08:19] their God in the midst of criticism in
[1:08:22] the midst of Mind battles in the midst
[1:08:24] of it all they're still not bowing their
[1:08:27] knee oh man and the Bible would say in
[1:08:30] the next verse Romans 11:5 even so then
[1:08:33] at this present time also there is a
[1:08:35] Remnant according to the election of
[1:08:38] Grace oh so not then but at this present
[1:08:41] time and I'm glad he put that this
[1:08:44] present time because that that can be
[1:08:46] there back back on Paul's day that can
[1:08:48] be in Luther's day or that can be today
[1:08:51] anytime you read that and it says this
[1:08:53] present time time that lets you know
[1:08:55] that God still has a Remnant today he
[1:08:58] still has an elected that is not bowing
[1:09:01] their knee oh but and you notice you
[1:09:04] know hey God was sayy I still got a body
[1:09:07] I still got a people they might not be
[1:09:09] in the Limelight but they're still there
[1:09:11] Elijah you're not the only one that's
[1:09:13] fighting persecution they're fighting it
[1:09:16] but they're still standing and you see
[1:09:18] that's a paradox that's a paradox to me
[1:09:21] is somebody that is standing against the
[1:09:23] pressure
[1:09:24] you know cuz cuz any the world uh
[1:09:27] denominations can imitate gifts they can
[1:09:30] imitate speaking in tongues they can
[1:09:31] imitate prophesying but there's one
[1:09:33] thing that can't imitate that is
[1:09:35] standing against the pressure to me that
[1:09:38] is a paradox and brother Brandon would
[1:09:39] say that's a paradox to see the word
[1:09:42] come forth not gifts not prophesying but
[1:09:46] the word come forth and but the Brandon
[1:09:48] would say Paradox means something
[1:09:50] incredible but true that is a paradox
[1:09:53] something that's almost completely out
[1:09:55] of Reason couldn't it be so but yet it
[1:09:58] is that a paradox oh something
[1:10:01] completely out of Reason couldn't it be
[1:10:03] so but yet it is and you know whenever
[1:10:06] we talk of a paradox we we automatically
[1:10:09] think of Joshua and you know causing the
[1:10:11] sun to stand still or or we think of
[1:10:13] Daniel laying with the Lions we think we
[1:10:15] think of Elisha saying where where's
[1:10:17] where's the god of Elijah you know those
[1:10:19] were natural paradoxes but the natural
[1:10:22] Seed of Abraham the Bible would tell
[1:10:23] tell us in Genesis 22 and 17 that in
[1:10:26] blessing I Will Bless thee in
[1:10:28] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:10:30] the stars of heaven and as the sand
[1:10:33] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[1:10:35] shall possess the gates of their enemy
[1:10:38] and so the natural seed would possess
[1:10:41] many natural Gates and brother Brandon
[1:10:43] would tell us Moses came against his
[1:10:45] gate the Red Sea and he possessed it he
[1:10:48] says that the the three Hebrew children
[1:10:50] went up against the Gate of fire and
[1:10:52] they possessed it it was a natural seed
[1:10:55] coming up against Natural Gates and
[1:10:57] brother Brandon would say this Daniel
[1:10:59] possessed the gates of the enemy's Gates
[1:11:01] of lions the mtha could not eat them and
[1:11:04] Samson one time a bunch of people had
[1:11:06] fenced him in the city and when he did
[1:11:08] he pulled those great big Gates out of
[1:11:10] the Rocks put them upon the shoulders
[1:11:12] and walked out up top of the hill why
[1:11:14] was he he was still in the Covenant his
[1:11:17] locks were still hanging there that was
[1:11:19] a promise that was laying there he'll
[1:11:22] possess the gates of his enemy and we
[1:11:24] see that a natural people under a
[1:11:27] covenant was producing exploits against
[1:11:30] the natural people against the
[1:11:32] Philistines against the fire against the
[1:11:34] Lions but they never come against the
[1:11:36] supernatural there were never overcoming
[1:11:39] things and here brother the Brandon
[1:11:40] would say this we've had all of these
[1:11:42] things in the path of Abraham's Royal
[1:11:44] seed has come up that same path that
[1:11:47] Abraham come up but just before
[1:11:49] destroying of the world the super sign
[1:11:52] must appear again and an eternal
[1:11:55] Everlasting Resurrection sign that
[1:11:57] proves that the Royal seed could not be
[1:11:59] like could not be killed like Daniel and
[1:12:02] the rest of the prophets was the grave
[1:12:04] could not hold him the others conquered
[1:12:07] Gates of the enemy such as fire lion
[1:12:10] sword and so forth they conquered that
[1:12:12] but this Royal seed conquered death hell
[1:12:15] and the grave nothing could hold
[1:12:18] him you see he said the natural seed
[1:12:21] conquered fire they conquered they coner
[1:12:23] a natural enemy but the Bible would tell
[1:12:25] us in Ephesians we wrestle not against
[1:12:28] flesh and blood but against
[1:12:30] principalities against Powers against
[1:12:32] rulers of Darkness so he's letting us
[1:12:34] know that we're not going to come
[1:12:36] against the natural people so how are we
[1:12:38] going to overcome and brother Brandon
[1:12:40] was telling us here that while he's an
[1:12:43] everlasting super sign what is a super
[1:12:46] sign the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:12:49] after being dead for 2,000 years stands
[1:12:51] in the midst of us the same as he did
[1:12:54] then manifesting himself in the church
[1:12:57] in human flesh and so just like Jesus
[1:13:00] overcome the super in the Supernatural
[1:13:03] realm you know brother the brandom says
[1:13:04] they overcome fire they overcome lies
[1:13:06] they overcome the Red Sea but Jesus
[1:13:08] overcome death Hell In The Grave he
[1:13:10] wasn't just overcoming the natural
[1:13:12] things he was overcoming the
[1:13:14] supernatural things and then he says
[1:13:16] he's doing it today inside of the church
[1:13:20] human flesh oh so we're not fighting the
[1:13:22] Philistines we're not fighting for for
[1:13:25] our Mountain but we're fighting in a
[1:13:27] supernatural realm but just like the
[1:13:30] natural seed they perform natural
[1:13:32] exploits there's a supernatural seed
[1:13:35] performing Supernatural exploits oh you
[1:13:38] might not look like you're doing much
[1:13:40] but if you're overcoming you're
[1:13:42] performing the Supernatural and oh man
[1:13:45] that's what's something that's been on
[1:13:46] my heart lately is you may never speak
[1:13:48] in tongues you may never you may never
[1:13:50] prophesy you may never lay hands on the
[1:13:53] sick and they recover you may never have
[1:13:55] a vision but that doesn't mean you're
[1:13:57] left out that doesn't mean you're not
[1:13:59] performing exploits some of you may
[1:14:01] never do that I've never spoken tongues
[1:14:04] I've never I've never had a vision I've
[1:14:06] never had a a word of Prophecy that
[1:14:09] doesn't mean I'm left out but it's the
[1:14:11] supernatural inside of a super seed
[1:14:15] performing the exploits when you wake up
[1:14:18] in the morning with the sound of mind
[1:14:20] that is exploits oh Hallelujah as a mama
[1:14:23] when you're teaching your children about
[1:14:25] the things of God that is exploits
[1:14:28] you're not left out God has called you
[1:14:30] in this
[1:14:32] generation Hallelujah to perform the
[1:14:36] exploits and you see and when we look
[1:14:39] about how the Royal se but brother brand
[1:14:41] would say Jesus he come and he conquered
[1:14:43] the spiritual he conquered death hell
[1:14:45] and the grave and we look at Philippians
[1:14:47] 4:7 and the peace of God which path
[1:14:51] passeth all understanding shall keep
[1:14:53] your hearts and Minds through Christ
[1:14:56] Jesus and I think man you want to talk
[1:14:58] about a paradox it's somebody with a
[1:15:00] sound of Mind in this generation come on
[1:15:03] we're living in the day of insanity
[1:15:05] people are losing their minds people
[1:15:07] mental illness is peing but at the same
[1:15:09] time it's completely out of reason for
[1:15:12] somebody to have a sane mind but it was
[1:15:15] promised that I'm not only going to keep
[1:15:17] your hearts when I'm going to keep your
[1:15:19] minds and oh man I don't think we have
[1:15:21] to lose our minds come on come on now
[1:15:23] sometimes masam wake up and they feel
[1:15:25] like they're losing their mind you don't
[1:15:26] got to lose your mind sometimes daddy
[1:15:28] under the pressure FL through he's going
[1:15:30] to lose his mind but he promised to not
[1:15:32] just keep your heart not just keep your
[1:15:35] body but we're looking into the
[1:15:37] supernatural I know the Mind battles but
[1:15:40] when you're keeping your mind it's
[1:15:43] exploits hallelujah we're living in the
[1:15:45] day of insanity the Bible would tell us
[1:15:47] in Isaiah 32:18 and my people shall
[1:15:50] dwell in a Peaceable habitation
[1:15:53] and Ur dwellings and in quiet resting
[1:15:56] places my people shall dwell in a
[1:15:59] Peaceable habitation a Peaceable in the
[1:16:02] midst of chaos there's a habitation that
[1:16:05] I'm dwelling again and David would say
[1:16:07] be th my habitation where I continually
[1:16:11] Resort not occasionally not often but be
[1:16:14] my habitation where I continually Resort
[1:16:18] you see if you don't know what what what
[1:16:20] what what's going to be the outcome you
[1:16:21] can never rest you know I remember as a
[1:16:24] kid as a little as a little child I'm
[1:16:26] sure all little kids go through it you
[1:16:28] think there's a boogie man in your
[1:16:29] closet you know you think there's a
[1:16:31] monster under the bed you and you you
[1:16:33] think and and I always had vivid dreams
[1:16:35] and I remember waking up thinking there
[1:16:37] there's somebody in the room and I could
[1:16:39] never rest I was never in a Peaceable
[1:16:41] habitation because my my mind was never
[1:16:44] out of rest but the Bible is saying my
[1:16:46] people shall dwell in a Peaceable
[1:16:49] habitation your mind can be at rest you
[1:16:52] can go to sleep sleep knowing that
[1:16:54] you're going to wake up tomorrow and
[1:16:56] God's going to keep you you can wake up
[1:16:58] tomorrow knowing that God's going to
[1:16:59] keep your children it's a Peaceable
[1:17:01] habitation it might not look like
[1:17:03] natural exploits but it's supernatural
[1:17:06] exploits taking place hope this is
[1:17:09] making sense tonight oh my the Bible
[1:17:11] would say in Isaiah 26 and3 thou will
[1:17:14] keep him in perfect peace who's a mind
[1:17:17] to stayed on thee because he trusteth in
[1:17:20] thee his mind shall be in perfect that
[1:17:23] would keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:17:25] mind is stayed upon thee the Bible would
[1:17:27] say we have our anchor of the Soul both
[1:17:30] sure and steadfast which ENT entereth
[1:17:33] into that within the Veil The Bible
[1:17:35] would say in 1 Thessalonians 1 and5 for
[1:17:37] a gospel came not into you in word only
[1:17:40] but also in power in the Holy Ghost and
[1:17:43] in much Assurance you know I'd never
[1:17:45] seen that much Assurance before I guess
[1:17:48] always heard in power and the Holy Ghost
[1:17:50] but he says in much Assurance that's why
[1:17:53] we can have a sound of mind we can be in
[1:17:55] a Peaceable habitation because
[1:17:57] understanding has brought us a a very
[1:17:59] much Assurance the Bible would tell us
[1:18:02] the AP in Acts 20 and 24 but none of
[1:18:05] these things move me none of these
[1:18:07] things no matter what I'm going through
[1:18:09] I'm in a Peaceable habitation somebody
[1:18:12] is standing strong not being tossed
[1:18:14] around back and forth not buckling under
[1:18:16] the pressure but they're dwelling in a
[1:18:18] Peaceable habitation you see brother
[1:18:21] Brandon would say then will it be
[1:18:23] Paradox in itself to take the very
[1:18:25] nature of a boy that's bred between
[1:18:27] father and mother and yet in his
[1:18:29] intellectuals he is trying his best best
[1:18:31] to overcome it he can't do it he'll
[1:18:34] never overcome it Christ will have to
[1:18:36] overcome it when he lets Christ in then
[1:18:38] he's already overcome then it'll be a
[1:18:40] perfect Paradox when a man is born of
[1:18:43] the spirit of God a perfect Paradox is
[1:18:46] the supernatural in the Supernatural
[1:18:48] realm oh this making sense
[1:18:50] tonight and it's like I I don't know why
[1:18:52] this has been something I that's been
[1:18:54] dealing been dealing on my heart that we
[1:18:56] don't got to look for the natural
[1:18:58] exploits but there's Supernatural things
[1:19:00] that we don't realize when we wake up
[1:19:02] and our children have the right mind
[1:19:04] that's exploits you know and I always
[1:19:07] have that fear that that my children
[1:19:09] would you know that there would be
[1:19:10] something wrong with them but here I got
[1:19:11] two children that have their right mind
[1:19:13] that's exploits we Overlook the little
[1:19:15] things looking for the big things we
[1:19:18] Overlook what God's doing here looking
[1:19:20] for something major and we fail to see
[1:19:22] that in the Supernatural there's
[1:19:24] exploits taking place there's
[1:19:26] achievements of faith that is taking
[1:19:29] place you see uh Mama keeping her home a
[1:19:32] sanctuary for God to dwell so her
[1:19:34] children have a safe haven Haven that's
[1:19:36] an exploits and you know the and the
[1:19:39] Bible would say in judges 6:12 and the
[1:19:41] angel of the Lord appeared he talking
[1:19:43] about Gideon appeared unto him and said
[1:19:45] unto him the Lord is with thee the
[1:19:47] Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto
[1:19:50] him oh my Lord if the Lord be with this
[1:19:53] why then is all this befallen us where
[1:19:56] be all of his miracles which our fathers
[1:19:58] told of saying did not the Lord bring us
[1:20:01] out of Egypt but now the Lord hath
[1:20:03] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[1:20:05] hands of the
[1:20:22] asset and I'm the least of my father's
[1:20:25] house and the Lord said unto him surely
[1:20:27] I will be with thee Thou shalt Smite the
[1:20:30] midianites as one man and sometimes we
[1:20:33] all feel like that I'm the least I'm not
[1:20:35] the greatest I've got nothing to offer
[1:20:37] I've got nothing to show and you know
[1:20:39] and and and what I thought was amazing
[1:20:41] is the and the angel of the Lord told
[1:20:43] Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor and
[1:20:45] then Gideon turns around and says but
[1:20:47] God I'm po I'm poor and you know one
[1:20:50] definition of Valor Is wealth and that
[1:20:53] just struck me that God was seeing him a
[1:20:55] certain way but Gideon was looking at
[1:20:57] himself in a completely different way
[1:21:00] come on now the way and because he was
[1:21:02] looking at himself different than the
[1:21:04] way God was looking at him he couldn't
[1:21:06] perform exploits but the angel of the
[1:21:09] Lord was saying you're a mighty man of
[1:21:11] Valor quit looking at yourself this way
[1:21:14] I see you in a completely different way
[1:21:16] oh man young people quit looking at
[1:21:18] yourself in a in a different way than
[1:21:20] what God looks at you he's looking natur
[1:21:22] just saying I've chosen you for a reason
[1:21:25] M I've chosen you for a reason daddies
[1:21:27] I've chosen you for a reason I know you
[1:21:29] feel tired I know you feel like you're
[1:21:31] you're you're the least in the Kingdom
[1:21:33] but I've chosen you you're you're
[1:21:35] wealthy God sees you in a completely
[1:21:37] different way all Gideon seen was
[1:21:39] failures all Gideon seen was
[1:21:41] insecurities all Gideon seen was
[1:21:44] inabilities but what God seen was
[1:21:46] exploits what God seen was the
[1:21:48] supernatural oh when little church all
[1:21:50] you may be looking at is insecurity
[1:21:52] ities all you may see his complexes all
[1:21:55] you may see his inabilities but God is
[1:21:57] saying I see something different I'm not
[1:22:00] looking at what you can do I'm looking
[1:22:01] what I can do I'm not looking at how
[1:22:04] great of a husband you are I'm looking
[1:22:05] how I am through you making you a great
[1:22:07] husband making you a great Mama making
[1:22:10] you raise up a children of exploits quit
[1:22:13] looking at the quit looking at your
[1:22:15] failures look at what I see where be the
[1:22:18] god of Miracles where's the exploits and
[1:22:21] God would say Gideon you're looking at
[1:22:22] it right there you're the exploits
[1:22:25] you're the miracle you're the one that's
[1:22:28] going to perform the Supernatural and
[1:22:31] you know and and and watching my wife
[1:22:33] not too embarrassed her but as as we
[1:22:35] travel it gets stressful and I and I
[1:22:38] feel for her you know I was talking to
[1:22:39] brother Harry it's pretty easy for us us
[1:22:41] husbands you know we pack the car unpack
[1:22:44] the car we we go to sleep you know she's
[1:22:46] up all night with the kids she's getting
[1:22:48] things packed back in the suitcase you
[1:22:49] know and you know brother brandom calls
[1:22:51] the mother the fth gospel and just
[1:22:54] watching her as she's with as she's with
[1:22:56] uh with Ethan and and training him up
[1:22:58] and with Briel and you know it's to be
[1:23:00] honest as I heard the girl sing that
[1:23:02] song back there that has really done
[1:23:04] something to my heart I want to live for
[1:23:06] Jesus that's the Fifth Gospel in action
[1:23:10] that's exploits you might not have
[1:23:12] anything that you can point to and say
[1:23:14] I'm doing the supernatural but you're
[1:23:16] looking to the supernatural realm and
[1:23:18] say Souls that are worth 10,000 worlds
[1:23:21] those are exploits
[1:23:23] you may get weary you may get tired you
[1:23:25] may feel like like you're not you're not
[1:23:27] wealthy in the kingdom of God but God
[1:23:29] has chose you for such a time as this
[1:23:32] there's exploits that are being risen up
[1:23:35] oh you may feel left out you may feel
[1:23:38] like like the husband has the calling
[1:23:40] but God has called you but the Brandon
[1:23:42] would say it's Matthew Mark Luke John
[1:23:44] mothers it's mothers why does the
[1:23:46] gospels do the gospels explain the Life
[1:23:49] of Christ and how come we put mothers
[1:23:52] there because it's mothers that explain
[1:23:54] the Life of Christ to the children hope
[1:23:56] this is okay tonight th this was really
[1:23:58] dealing with my heart and brother brand
[1:24:00] I'm going talk about John he says as
[1:24:02] John was up on the boat with the
[1:24:04] disciples and he says he would start to
[1:24:06] testify and say I I know this is the
[1:24:09] Messiah I know this is Jesus and he
[1:24:11] would REM he would go into go into his
[1:24:13] memory and say I remember as a child
[1:24:16] mama would put me on her knee and tell
[1:24:18] me about Elijah she would tell me about
[1:24:21] about Jos and the walls coming down and
[1:24:24] brother brandham says John would make
[1:24:26] the connection between Jehovah and Jesus
[1:24:30] how come the Fifth Gospel and I think oh
[1:24:33] Lord I want my children to make the
[1:24:35] connection between Jesus and the Bible
[1:24:38] and Jesus in this message they're one
[1:24:40] and the same but what's making the
[1:24:43] connection The Fifth Gospel it's mothers
[1:24:46] that are with them every day that is
[1:24:48] with them that that's helping their
[1:24:49] scrape knees or helping their runny
[1:24:50] noses but at the same time there's you
[1:24:53] might not see something taking place
[1:24:55] naturally but look in the Supernatural
[1:24:58] realm and you'll see that there's a
[1:24:59] connection taking place there's a
[1:25:01] connection every time you pray with them
[1:25:03] over their food there's a connection
[1:25:05] that has taken place and brother Brandon
[1:25:08] was saying Little John was convinced
[1:25:09] that the Bible stories that mother told
[1:25:11] him about Jehovah that same Jehovah was
[1:25:14] manifested in a man called the Lord
[1:25:16] Jesus cuz no one else could have done it
[1:25:19] he was the creator he was convinced
[1:25:21] because of a mother you think you think
[1:25:24] of uh uh it was blind bmus brother
[1:25:26] brandom talks about blind bmus so it was
[1:25:29] blind bmus the mother that his mother
[1:25:31] would put her on his on her lap and
[1:25:34] brother Brandon would say he would she
[1:25:35] would wipe the tears off his face and
[1:25:38] push back his hair and start to tell him
[1:25:40] about Jehovah start to tell him about uh
[1:25:44] about how Moses split the Red Sea and
[1:25:46] the brother brandom dramatizes it he he
[1:25:48] says he she tells the story about Joshua
[1:25:50] and Jericho's walls follow falling down
[1:25:53] and now here's blind barus he's sitting
[1:25:55] upon the the ruins of that wall he's
[1:25:57] sitting there brother the brandom says
[1:25:59] he starts to think about the stories
[1:26:01] that Mama would tell him and I I could
[1:26:04] just imagine as he's sitting there he
[1:26:06] can't see he's just thinking of how Mama
[1:26:08] talked about Jehovah Mama talked about
[1:26:11] Joshua causing knocking the walls down
[1:26:13] Moses split in the Red Sea but he
[1:26:15] couldn't see he wanted to see this
[1:26:17] Jehovah he wanted to see this God and
[1:26:20] all of a sudden he heard a commotion he
[1:26:21] heard commotion and and somebody would
[1:26:24] come and tell him hey hey there Jesus is
[1:26:27] walking by and a connection would
[1:26:29] connect something would connect what was
[1:26:31] it it was the reality of
[1:26:34] Jehovah and the and and Jehovah the mama
[1:26:37] would tell him about come together and
[1:26:40] coming by his way was his eyesight did
[1:26:43] you ever think about that coming by his
[1:26:45] way his eyesight his Paradox his exploit
[1:26:49] come about because of a mama did you
[1:26:52] ever think about that mama ain't Less in
[1:26:55] the kingdom of God hope this is okay
[1:26:57] tonight mama ain't a door M mama is
[1:27:00] making the connection blind barus got
[1:27:03] his eyesight because of mama was the
[1:27:05] Fifth Gospel talking about Jehovah and
[1:27:08] there he is sitting there then Here
[1:27:10] Comes his isai walking by and oh man I
[1:27:13] could just imagine oh that's the one
[1:27:16] that's the god that split the Red Sea
[1:27:18] that's the god that brought down
[1:27:20] Jericho's walls that's the god that
[1:27:22] defeated of Goliath that's the God right
[1:27:24] there that's the connection mama's been
[1:27:26] telling me about you see brother Brandon
[1:27:29] would would say this on this spot a
[1:27:31] certain beggar by the name of blind bmus
[1:27:33] sitting at the gate he was thinking of
[1:27:35] those things and he sat there first
[1:27:37] thing he begin to think when I was a
[1:27:39] little boy I had eyesight and I remember
[1:27:41] when I used to play on the Hills Yonder
[1:27:44] and pick pretty flowers in Juda I can
[1:27:46] remember my darling mother how she would
[1:27:48] take me in her arms and stroke his
[1:27:50] little black hair from from his blue
[1:27:52] eyes and say barus you're the sweetest
[1:27:55] little boy and how she used to Rock Me
[1:27:57] In Her Arms and tell me Bible stories
[1:27:59] and he says you know America needs more
[1:28:01] mothers like that not so much about
[1:28:04] David Crockett and Elvis Presley Arthur
[1:28:07] Godfrey what about Christ the Bible
[1:28:10] there's more kids in the city that could
[1:28:12] tell you about Elvis than there is that
[1:28:14] can tell you about Jesus Christ and then
[1:28:16] you wonder why we got juvenile
[1:28:18] delinquency stabbing people to death on
[1:28:20] the streets and we become a neur age
[1:28:22] because we left God out if that's
[1:28:24] happening in the world what about here
[1:28:27] today there's the opposite effect
[1:28:30] there's some young children that is
[1:28:31] raising up with
[1:28:33] exploits raising up and becoming a
[1:28:36] paradox let our musicians come
[1:28:41] tonight if the world has their example
[1:28:44] God has his example there's going to be
[1:28:46] a voice on both sides there's going to
[1:28:48] be exploits on both sides let us be a
[1:28:51] Godly example Amen brother Brandon
[1:28:54] preaches a message and you know and and
[1:28:56] and teaching on
[1:28:57] Moses and it's a kid message and man if
[1:29:00] parents have I I listen to it and to be
[1:29:02] honest it it it I don't know I remember
[1:29:06] before I had children I'm sure parents
[1:29:08] can can testify I I felt bad having kids
[1:29:12] just because we're living in a crazy
[1:29:14] world they they didn't choose to be here
[1:29:17] and that really really was was on my
[1:29:20] mind that man where there's h sexuals
[1:29:23] lesbians there's there's drugs there
[1:29:25] it's it's a crazy age and here these
[1:29:28] little innocent children are being born
[1:29:30] into a crazy a crazy time and brother
[1:29:33] Brandon preached the message teaching on
[1:29:34] Moses and it's a kid message but it
[1:29:37] encouraged me as a parent if y'all
[1:29:39] haven't listened to it before really
[1:29:40] encouraged me brother brandom he he
[1:29:43] talks about Moses and he says the angel
[1:29:45] of God come to amram which is Moses's
[1:29:48] dad and he says because you've been
[1:29:50] faithful in your house
[1:29:52] and you've been a praying man you're
[1:29:54] going to be a part of my program and he
[1:29:57] says out of your seed is going to come
[1:29:59] the deliver her because you've been
[1:30:01] faithful and as Amron would go to jocked
[1:30:04] and start to tell her what the angel
[1:30:06] told her and brother Brandon and he says
[1:30:08] this is back in 50
[1:30:10] 56 and he said and joab would say no we
[1:30:14] can't have a child now they're killing
[1:30:16] babies we can't have a child this this
[1:30:18] ain't the right time for it and that
[1:30:20] really just struck me this ain't the
[1:30:22] time but then he would say but the Lord
[1:30:25] told me he would keep the baby and that
[1:30:29] struck me as a parent God has given us a
[1:30:32] promise we got a crazy world out there
[1:30:35] but God promised to keep our children
[1:30:38] God promised to keep our babies no
[1:30:40] matter what they go through if we just
[1:30:42] apply the token if mothers be their
[1:30:45] Fifth Gospel if fathers be an amran and
[1:30:48] keep their house in
[1:30:49] prayer and again and create an
[1:30:52] environment for God to flow through and
[1:30:55] brother Brandon would say and he would
[1:30:58] call all the uh uh he he would call a
[1:31:00] council meeting Pharaoh would and he
[1:31:02] said there' be some some old witch
[1:31:04] ladies with long noses would come up and
[1:31:06] say I know what to do we kill the babies
[1:31:09] brother brandom says it's the same today
[1:31:11] they're trying to kill our children I
[1:31:13] think man it's it's the lesbians the
[1:31:15] spirits that women are putting out there
[1:31:19] that are killing our babies killing our
[1:31:21] killing
[1:31:22] teenagers brother Brandon would say but
[1:31:25] you know if God gave us this baby God
[1:31:27] will take care of the baby God promised
[1:31:30] and God would take care of it and
[1:31:32] brother Brandon would say as Pharaoh was
[1:31:34] destroying homes killing babies and this
[1:31:37] destruct me brother brandom says here
[1:31:39] comes one of those old witches knocking
[1:31:41] on the door so I know you got a baby in
[1:31:43] there and they said the parents would
[1:31:45] say no we don't got a baby to give and
[1:31:49] that distract me the world of Hollywood
[1:31:51] with the spirits are coming through each
[1:31:53] hope coming through lives knocking on
[1:31:55] the doors and as it comes to our house
[1:31:57] we can say we got one but we don't got
[1:31:59] one to give we don't got any to give and
[1:32:02] brother brandham says we ain't got no
[1:32:04] baby to give you and he says they didn't
[1:32:07] oh man then then he says okay we'll come
[1:32:10] back later and brother brandham says
[1:32:12] there was a little secret place that
[1:32:14] amrad had prepared for the baby then
[1:32:16] here they come back kicking the door in
[1:32:19] but he says he put the baby in the
[1:32:20] secret place and here they come
[1:32:22] searching through the hole when never
[1:32:24] could find it because the secret place I
[1:32:26] think oh my there's a Peaceable
[1:32:28] habitation that we can dwell in a secret
[1:32:32] place not just for us but for our
[1:32:34] children whenever the world comes about
[1:32:36] knocking on the door influences are
[1:32:38] trying to come in homosexual Spirits are
[1:32:41] trying to break down the door break
[1:32:43] break down the bars there's a Peaceable
[1:32:46] habitation there's a secret place that
[1:32:49] they can't find him oh brother BR says
[1:32:51] they search through the home saying we
[1:32:53] know you got a baby in here we know you
[1:32:55] got one in here but brother brandom says
[1:32:58] it was a secret place they looked
[1:33:00] everywhere and couldn't find it oh man
[1:33:04] brother Brandon would say this she goes
[1:33:06] upstairs and prays Jehova you got ears
[1:33:08] Jehovah you got eyes you can hear you
[1:33:10] can answer prayer you gave us this baby
[1:33:13] you gave us your promise and you will
[1:33:15] keep your promise you'll keep that baby
[1:33:19] I'm confident and oh man and and like I
[1:33:22] said this has been just speaking to my
[1:33:24] heart that sometimes we can't point to
[1:33:26] Natural exploits but in the Supernatural
[1:33:30] children are
[1:33:31] exploits our marriages are exploits a
[1:33:34] sound of mind is
[1:33:36] exploits the brother Brandon would say
[1:33:39] and daddy would go inside the workshop
[1:33:41] and he says he's singing a song I think
[1:33:43] he was singing Old Time religion and if
[1:33:45] you listen to it he's sitting on the
[1:33:46] pull pit he he's knocking he's singing
[1:33:49] and you can hear the children laughing
[1:33:50] in the background but then you also hear
[1:33:52] some parents and you can just tell it's
[1:33:54] it's really striking home you hear them
[1:33:56] it's Amen and you can you can hear a
[1:33:58] little cry ever so often and brother
[1:34:00] brandom says he's building a little ship
[1:34:03] it hasn't got no Rudder hasn't got no
[1:34:05] sail hasn't got no cannons on it yet
[1:34:08] it's going to pack the most precious
[1:34:10] cargo that was ever packed by a
[1:34:12] ship then brother B he's reading he's
[1:34:15] preaching off of the the this scripture
[1:34:16] in Luke 9:24 for whosoever shall save
[1:34:19] his life shall lose it but who who
[1:34:21] whoever shall lose his life for my sake
[1:34:24] shall save it and and brother brandom
[1:34:26] says AMR is speaking to jocked it says
[1:34:29] but we got to get rid of it we got to
[1:34:31] give it back we got to give it back if
[1:34:34] we keep it we're going to lose it and
[1:34:37] brother brandom's just typing that out
[1:34:38] to the children if you keep your soul
[1:34:40] you're going to lose it but if you give
[1:34:42] it back to the one who gave it to you
[1:34:44] you're going to keep it but that just
[1:34:47] struck me as a parent that we can give
[1:34:49] our children back to God we're not
[1:34:51] keeping them and saying okay we're going
[1:34:53] to do what our want but since we're in a
[1:34:55] Peaceable habitation since we've come in
[1:34:58] contact with our God we gave our
[1:35:01] children back to our back to the Lord
[1:35:04] and not not and do what what Daniel did
[1:35:06] not just say that in our heart and do
[1:35:08] what we want bring Spirits in bring
[1:35:10] influences in but Daniel says since I'm
[1:35:12] purposing in my heart I'm going to make
[1:35:15] changes I'm going to request to make
[1:35:18] changes and this is what jocked and
[1:35:20] amran was doing we're not just saying
[1:35:22] we're giving it back to back to God in
[1:35:24] the heart but we're giving it to God and
[1:35:27] I than Lord we're giving our children
[1:35:30] back hope this has been okay
[1:35:33] tonight in the midst of a chaotic time
[1:35:37] brother brandham would say and and
[1:35:39] parents I don't encourage you just go
[1:35:40] and listen to this it just it really it
[1:35:42] spoke to my heart and brother brandham
[1:35:44] would say that as he they put the boat
[1:35:47] inside of the river he says when
[1:35:49] something is happening on Earth
[1:35:52] something is also happening in heaven he
[1:35:54] says God gets Gabriel and says hey
[1:35:57] Gabriel come here he says look down
[1:35:59] there see that's the man you went down
[1:36:01] and visited and said he was going to
[1:36:03] have the baby he says look look they're
[1:36:07] standing they're standing and he says
[1:36:09] okay I want I can't remember what the
[1:36:11] number I want like 10,000 angels to go
[1:36:14] down there go down there and watch over
[1:36:16] that cargo and one of the angels look to
[1:36:19] God and says where are you going to go
[1:36:22] he says I'm at the receiving end of it
[1:36:24] so I'm going to be at the end to receive
[1:36:26] it and I thought oh my if we just give
[1:36:29] it back to God away from the influences
[1:36:33] away from the pressure of the world
[1:36:35] there's 10,000 angels brother Brandon
[1:36:38] would say here would come a crocodile
[1:36:39] and Angel would say no here would come a
[1:36:41] whirlpool and the angel says no and
[1:36:43] there the carg would go through the
[1:36:46] midst of Le oosa our children are being
[1:36:49] raised in the midst of Le oosa and yet
[1:36:52] there're still
[1:36:53] exploits oh M you might not comp point
[1:36:56] and say oh yeah I've done this I've done
[1:36:58] that I do this but look up the exploits
[1:37:00] on the front row look up the exploits
[1:37:03] brother the mar look up the exploits
[1:37:05] look up look at Sister Sister Mary
[1:37:08] Sister Amy Sister Laura brother Adam
[1:37:10] those are exploits brother Mitch you got
[1:37:13] your children those are exploits sister
[1:37:15] totha you might not be able to look and
[1:37:17] say I've done this but look at the
[1:37:20] exploits sister Stephanie look at your
[1:37:23] exploit you know but the Tor sister
[1:37:26] April we might not be able to point at
[1:37:28] things but we can point in the
[1:37:31] Supernatural and say since I'm a
[1:37:32] supernatural seed I'm performing
[1:37:35] Supernatural exploits let's bow our
[1:37:37] heads
[1:37:39] tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[1:37:42] Father Lord this is what's been on my
[1:37:44] heart lately

[1:37:55] we good enough parents for our
[1:37:57] children lord they're so innocent they
[1:38:01] don't know anything Lord the only thing
[1:38:02] they know is what we teach
[1:38:04] them and Lord as a parent I ask that you
[1:38:07] would help us to be an amram a joabe

[1:38:32] there's a Fifth Gospel here that's tired
[1:38:34] and weary Lord remind them tonight that
[1:38:36] there's exploits that they can look at
[1:38:39] father there's a paradox living in a day
[1:38:42] where children don't know if they're
[1:38:44] girls or boys It seems impossible but
[1:38:46] yet it's true for there's there's
[1:38:48] children that's in a Peaceable
[1:38:50] habitation
[1:38:51] as we leave this place father may we not
[1:38:53] just purpose in our heart but may we
