[34:19] are unto
[34:20] him amen I I'm a firm believer that the
[34:24] greatest thing you'll ever do is give
[34:25] your all to Jesus Christ and one of my
[34:28] favorite quotes is the prophet of God
[34:30] saying that there was a said there was a
[34:32] reason I didn't give my heart to God at
[34:33] a younger age he said there was a spirit
[34:35] hung over me telling me just wait a
[34:37] little while longer he said but there
[34:39] was a God that was there waiting for me
[34:42] and he said the only thing had to happen
[34:43] was that Spirit had to be broken and he
[34:45] said then I could go out yonder and
[34:47] fully believe he was my savior and you
[34:49] know tonight I don't think there's a
[34:51] better thing we can do than allow the
[34:52] Holy Spirit to break Spirits over our
[34:54] lives that'll give us a liberty to go
[34:57] out yonder and believe God don't you

[40:05] somebody say shall

[40:12] has said out of his belly shall flow
[40:16] rivers of Living Water amen out of his
[40:20] belly shall flow Rivers not of stagnated

[40:32] the help of the Lord for just a few
[40:33] moments tonight if I would take a title
[40:36] I want to speak to you on this for a few
[40:38] moments here unclogging the channels of
[40:41] our heart unclogging the channels of our
[40:45] heart 1961 brother BR preaches a sermon
[40:48] called getting in the spirit he said now
[40:50] we got the people just clean out the
[40:52] channel how many believes that we've got
[40:54] the people he said just clean out the
[40:56] channel see the people's all right but
[40:58] get the channels cleaned out so the Holy
[41:01] Spirit can come in see all your
[41:03] fanaticisms and
[41:07] it the thing out brother brandom is not
[41:10] just saying something to be saying it
[41:12] but he's saying it on purpose that we
[41:14] have the people amen but what we need is
[41:16] the Holy Ghost we have the abilities and
[41:18] we have all the uh the things that
[41:21] someone would think we would need to
[41:22] have a church we have all that but what
[41:24] we need is the Holy Spirit to find a
[41:27] right away Amen to come into what we
[41:29] have and to manifest himself in the
[41:32] power amen of his word now I believe
[41:34] tonight that the word of God is in the
[41:36] church how many believes the word of God
[41:38] is in the church and I believe amen that
[41:40] the word will produce amen exactly what
[41:44] God promised it would produce if we can
[41:46] just get it amen in the right kind of a
[41:48] heart how many knows the Bible says amen
[41:51] that God desires a clean heart he
[41:54] desires amen a Sanctified heart he
[41:56] desires S A Heart That is not full of
[41:59] Filth or defilement or the things of the
[42:01] world the prophet of God said like this
[42:03] he said I seen not long ago where they
[42:05] went into the Garners of Egypt and they
[42:06] got some wheat that was put in there
[42:08] about 2500 years ago or more than that
[42:11] about 3,000 years ago it was put in
[42:13] there by Joseph and some of the weed had
[42:15] been laying there for all those years
[42:17] and it had been planted in the ground
[42:19] and it produced again he said no no
[42:21] matter how long this gospel lays here
[42:24] amen 2,000 years we've had m ERS and
[42:27] scoffers and same the days of Miracles
[42:30] is passed amen but if you put that word
[42:33] in the right kind of a heart it'll
[42:35] produce again exactly amen like it did
[42:38] in the first time amen because it's the
[42:41] word of God see it's got to come into a
[42:44] Channel of faith and as long as it laid
[42:47] in the Garner it didn't need nothing it
[42:49] was just staying there as a memorial
[42:52] folks I don't believe that God is
[42:54] Desiring the revelation of his word amen
[42:57] to just stand in our churches as
[42:59] memorials or just as statues or just how
[43:02] God used to move or how God used to do
[43:04] things but I believe this is the season
[43:06] where God is looking amen for Honest
[43:09] Hearts the prophet of the holy spirit is
[43:11] here and he is hunting out Honest Hearts
[43:13] to believe the spirit's message I
[43:16] believe this is the time that God is
[43:18] looking amen for Honest Hearts Amen to
[43:21] sew his word into amen that they would
[43:24] produce the results that the word is
[43:26] promised promise to produce well when
[43:28] you start thinking about this how amen
[43:30] that every year we go from January to
[43:33] December and then those 12 months
[43:35] brother Kobe there's actually four
[43:36] seasons right amen there's a winter and
[43:39] then there's a spring and then there's a
[43:40] summer amen and then there's a fall now
[43:43] we are just coming out of winter and
[43:45] we're looking forward to Spring amen and
[43:47] when spring starts coming around amen we
[43:50] start talking about a spring cleaning
[43:52] you know amen but what what are we
[43:53] really talking about amen we're talking
[43:55] about a time to clean out the closet you
[43:58] know amen go through all the shelves in
[44:00] the garage and amen go through all the
[44:02] buildings out back what we're talking
[44:04] about amen is cleaning out and getting
[44:06] rid of Amen unneeded stuff and making
[44:10] room for new things now you all know
[44:12] that the natural amen types the
[44:14] spiritual and I believe if we have a
[44:16] natural spring cleaning amen I think we
[44:19] ought to have a spiritual spring
[44:20] cleaning I think what the prophet of God
[44:22] called it was an oldfashioned house
[44:24] cleaning amen where the fire of God
[44:26] would burn in the church and it would
[44:28] burn out everything that did not belong
[44:30] there amen it would burn out every sin
[44:32] and every unbelief and every
[44:34] misunderstanding and every every little
[44:36] problem and folks I believe that what
[44:38] the church needs amen is the fire of God
[44:41] to break out in the church again listen
[44:43] I think it's time to quit and getting so
[44:45] down on ourselves and amen ready to
[44:47] throw up our hands and quit amen the
[44:49] problem is we need to let the Holy Ghost
[44:51] clean out the channels amen and when the
[44:53] Holy Ghost begins to move amen he begins
[44:56] to remove unnecessary stuff and I I'll
[44:59] tell you what's unnecessary is bad
[45:01] attitudes amen I'll tell you what's
[45:03] unnecessary is our alts and amen
[45:05] bitterness and grudges and unforgiveness
[45:08] amen but what is necessary amen is the
[45:11] love of God that passes all
[45:13] understanding amen what is necessary
[45:15] amen is the ability to forgive and to
[45:18] forget and to move on Amen I love what
[45:20] David said in Psalms 19:12 he said who
[45:24] can understand his errors amen cleanse
[45:26] thou me from Secret faults amen isn't
[45:29] that powerful David is praying and he
[45:31] said oh God would you cleanse me amen
[45:34] from Secret faults amen I tell you
[45:36] sometimes that's what we need to do is
[45:38] pray like David amen and say Lord let
[45:40] the Holy Ghost amen be a discerner of
[45:43] the faults and the intents of my heart
[45:45] and let the Holy Ghost clean out all the
[45:47] sacred fault now come on we we we we can
[45:50] get a little religious here amen but
[45:52] I'll just say it very plainly there are
[45:53] still hum humans in the church and there
[45:56] still mistakes and there still sins and
[45:59] I think it's time to remember amen that
[46:01] we don't just need encouraging sometimes
[46:03] amen sometimes we need to repent and
[46:06] amen sometimes we need to ask God to
[46:08] forgive us and God to help us amen I
[46:10] think it's time to come back to
[46:11] preaching the repentance of the Gospel
[46:13] amen and make the church a place where
[46:15] the word of God can find a right way to
[46:18] bless a heart and to save a soul David
[46:21] goes on in his prayer and he says Wash
[46:23] Me thoroughly from my iniquity amen and
[46:25] cleanse me from my sin sin he said
[46:27] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[46:30] sin did my mother conceive me but watch
[46:33] what he said he said but oh God Purge me
[46:35] with hisp and I shall be clean amen wash
[46:39] me and I shall be whiter than snow in
[46:41] Psalm 799 help us oh god of our
[46:44] Salvation amen for the glory of thy name
[46:47] amen and Deliver Us amen and Purge away
[46:51] our sins amen for thy name's sake are
[46:54] youall reading what I'm reading amen
[46:56] David who is a man after God's Own Heart
[46:59] he found himself in a place where he
[47:01] said help me oh God you are the god of
[47:04] my salvation and for the glory of thy
[47:07] name amen Deliver Me Lord amen this is
[47:10] the man that said oh God Amen I don't
[47:12] want to hide my secret faults I don't
[47:14] want to hide my secret failures but you
[47:17] are the god of my salvation Lord I
[47:19] invite you Amen to come and look at my
[47:22] heart look at my life look at my soul
[47:25] amen read me like a book over God cuz I
[47:27] don't want to be found unworthy I don't
[47:30] want to be found bound amen when the
[47:32] enemy comes in I want to have a liberty
[47:34] to fight the enemy he said Purge away
[47:37] our sins amen I'll say what a prophet
[47:40] said he said I do believe in a Purgatory
[47:42] he said but I believe it's right now
[47:45] amen you purge your own soul he said
[47:47] what does purgatory mean amen it means
[47:50] to purge when you see you've done
[47:52] something wrong amen get out there and
[47:55] clean it out of you amen how do you do
[47:58] it he said by confession amen and crying
[48:01] and fasting and
[48:04] praying now I know it's become a it's
[48:06] become a moery among a lot of people to
[48:08] really get sincere before God but a
[48:11] prophet of God said amen the lord gave
[48:13] me a vision the other day and he said he
[48:15] showed me I had the power Amen to bind
[48:18] that serpent he said but someone even
[48:20] laughed at me amen at that Vision amen
[48:23] and said why would you step out like
[48:24] that he said that's what I wanted all my
[48:27] life he said but then I begin to fast
[48:30] and I begin to pray and they said well
[48:32] what did you do that for I said in there
[48:34] he said amen that I was not sincere
[48:38] enough now come on we're not talking
[48:40] about o Roberts or Billy Graham or Jack
[48:42] Cole amen we're talking about William
[48:44] Brandon folks we're talking about the
[48:47] seventh angel but the spirit of God told
[48:49] him amen somewhere in his life there was
[48:52] an area he was not sincere enough after
[48:55] he come he said then I wanted to purge
[48:58] myself amen not wait till you die and
[49:01] let some try some priest try to purge
[49:03] you amen he said but Purge amen your
[49:06] souls how many can say tonight Lord amen
[49:09] I want a good oldfashioned purging Lord
[49:12] amen I want you to purge my soul I want
[49:14] you to purge my heart I want you to
[49:16] purge my thoughts Lord amen I want you
[49:19] to purge my home I want you to purge my
[49:21] church I want you to purge my faith I
[49:24] want you to purge My Worship Lord from
[49:26] the top of my head to the souls of my
[49:28] feet oh God I am asking that the god of
[49:31] David amen would come into New Life
[49:33] Outreach by the power of the Holy Ghost
[49:36] and would purges from the pulpit to the
[49:38] back door amen restore unto me the joy
[49:41] of my salvation and renew a right Spirit
[49:44] within me oh God don't hide my secret
[49:47] faults don't run away from me God Amen
[49:50] but since you love me enough to come
[49:51] down would you purge me oh God I want to
[49:54] be right in your eyes
[49:57] brother Ram preached that message
[49:58] several times and he called it a door
[50:00] and a door and what he done was he took
[50:02] time to clearly identify to you amen
[50:05] that there are many doors in the heart
[50:07] of a human being amen the reason those
[50:09] doors are there amen is because God
[50:12] wants to gain access amen church God
[50:15] wants to gain entrance amen he said see
[50:17] there's the door of Pride he said
[50:19] there's the door of that private life
[50:22] amen there's the Door of Faith amen all
[50:24] kinds of doors in the door of the heart
[50:27] no wonder Solomon said amen keep thy
[50:30] heart with all diligence amen for out of
[50:33] it are the issues of Life brother said
[50:36] if there is an ALT in your heart against
[50:38] anyone amen go to them
[50:42] now that's a prophet church if there's
[50:45] an A in your heart against anyone go to
[50:48] them now and be reconciled amen and
[50:51] forget all the past and if you've been
[50:53] having ups and down life amen remember
[50:56] some something has come into your heart
[50:59] and something has moved into those
[51:02] thoughts something has come into your
[51:04] heart and something has moved into those
[51:07] thoughts no matter who your enemy is
[51:09] amen love him no matter what's happened
[51:12] let it go after all you're in a fi with
[51:14] weeds we realize that but we must grow
[51:17] together see we've got to come up
[51:19] together amen for a good wh amen cannot
[51:22] put forth evil Waters and neither can an
[51:25] evil wh amen put forth uh bad Waters or
[51:28] good Waters he said a tree cannot bring
[51:31] forth corrupt fruit and good fruit at
[51:33] the same time he said so let's either
[51:35] make the whole well clean or let's make
[51:38] the whole well dirty amen one or the
[51:40] other amen church I think it's time to
[51:42] do what a prophet said either clean it
[51:44] up amen or just let it get filthier amen
[51:47] but ask for me in my house I am a Son of
[51:50] God and I have been given a right by the
[51:52] blood of Jesus Christ amen to repent of
[51:55] my sins amen to repent of my wrongs to
[51:58] repent of my mistakes and say Lord you
[52:00] said there was a propitiation Amen in
[52:03] the atonement for my sin listen can I
[52:05] say this you ain't got to Bear your head
[52:07] amen and let the well become dirty New
[52:10] Life Outreach I'm preaching to you you
[52:12] ain't got to Bear your head and let the
[52:14] well in this church become dirty there
[52:16] is a God in Israel tonight and his name
[52:19] is Jesus Christ and the minute you begin
[52:21] to call on him like David did he will
[52:24] come down in the power of His word in
[52:26] the power of His redemption in the power
[52:29] of His cleansing and change that dirty

[53:47] all of us Amen to go back to the old
[53:49] Landmark amen and clean out the RS amen
[53:53] what would happen if actually this

[54:41] expectation that go back to the place
[54:43] where the man of God studied and labored
[54:45] and he found the mind of God and he come
[54:48] out here and begin to preach and he come
[54:50] out here and begin to labor and there

[55:06] old Landmark where the power of God used
[55:08] to shake us from the pulpit to the back
[55:11] door I tell you what there's a
[55:13] possibility tonight for every one of us
[55:15] to put our walking shoes on and go back

[56:24] a cog in there am then the Holy Ghost is
[56:27] going to get backed up somewhere but I
[56:29] come by with good news tonight there is
[56:32] a stick of dynamites in the house of God
[56:35] Amen to bow out every channel to bow out
[56:37] every channel to bow out every channel

[56:42] Waters of God can break free in the

[56:46] perishing condition into a Revival of
[56:49] joy unspeakable and full of Glory yes
[56:53] sir God works through channels God
[56:56] prepares the channel and the devil does
[56:59] everything he can Amen to clog the
[57:01] channel channels become clogged which
[57:04] means they become blocked amen so that
[57:06] little or nothing can pass through do

[57:15] you've got to remove the accumulated
[57:17] matter you got to you got to remove
[57:20] what's accumulated in there I say this I
[57:22] believe another word for unclogging
[57:24] could be Revival
[57:27] I believe another word brother Wendell
[57:29] for unclogging could be Revival Revival
[57:32] is to wash all the trash and the
[57:34] unbelief out and let the people come out
[57:37] he said night after night and see that
[57:39] God is still God think about that
[57:41] brother Merl brother random was
[57:43] preaching to people who had spiritual
[57:45] arteries clogged by Theology and by
[57:48] denomination and tradition and forms and
[57:50] religion and fashion amen but the
[57:52] prophet stood there and he said there's
[57:54] a chance for a spirit artery cleanse
[57:57] where you can come out here and you can
[57:59] see God is still God and His word is
[58:02] still true and his power is still here
[58:04] oh folks David said it like this search
[58:07] me oh God and know my heart amen I say
[58:10] what what the Bible says in Malachi 3

[58:53] not turning around I'm going to March
[58:55] out of here and some morning because I
[58:58] refuse I refuse to let the devil clog
[59:01] the channels in the body of
[59:04] Christ sometimes you got to blow them
[59:06] things out and let the Holy Ghost come
[59:08] back in there because the channel of God
[59:11] is always
[59:13] open the prophet of God said the channel
[59:16] of God is always open he said so there
[59:19] is a genuine Faith he said you must come
[59:21] into the real channel of God to have
[59:24] that genuine Faith do you know know this
[59:26] we will never find the channel of God
[59:29] without the mind of Christ but can I
[59:31] tell you what Paul said he said but we
[59:34] have we're not looking for but we have
[59:38] the mind of Christ he said listen here
[59:41] is the secret of it amen the word is in
[59:44] the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[59:48] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[59:51] what he wants done with his word that's
[59:54] why the devil hates you because you have
[59:57] the mind of Christ you have the ability
[1:00:00] Amen to acknowledge thus sayith the Lord
[1:00:02] oh church I tell you what the devil
[1:00:04] don't want to hear he don't want to hear
[1:00:06] thus sayith the Lord Brother I'm calling
[1:00:08] them four blast words amen thus sayith
[1:00:11] the Lord but you know what I say I say
[1:00:14] thus sayith the Lord there's a
[1:00:15] possibility for a breakthrough I say
[1:00:18] thus sayith the Lord there is a
[1:00:20] possibility for an oldfashioned altar
[1:00:22] call where the Holy Ghost can clean a
[1:00:24] man up oh thus sayith the Lord there is
[1:00:27] a possibility to go back to the old
[1:00:31] landmarks I ain't lost my mind I've got
[1:00:34] the word of the Lord amen and here's
[1:00:36] what a prophet said she performs the
[1:00:38] command of his word in his name for she
[1:00:42] has thus saith the Lord well Church in
[1:00:47] Genesis 4 you will find Cain and abble
[1:00:50] amen at the altar amen and the prop of
[1:00:53] God picked it up in Hebrews 11 and four
[1:00:55] and he said by Faith abble offered unto
[1:00:57] God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain
[1:01:00] by the which he obtained a witness that
[1:01:02] he was righteous amen God testifying of
[1:01:05] his gifts amen look and by it he being
[1:01:08] dead yet speaketh listen Cain was just
[1:01:10] as religious as abble was they both went
[1:01:13] to church they both paid tithes said
[1:01:16] they both worshiped they both made
[1:01:18] sacrifice he said but Able by faith
[1:01:21] which is the revelation of the word of
[1:01:23] God he revealed made plain soed out and
[1:01:27] Vindicated he said see amen by
[1:01:30] Revelation he found the true channel oh
[1:01:33] Hallelujah by Revelation he found the
[1:01:36] true Channel you say well my church is
[1:01:39] it you wait just a minute amen God
[1:01:41] interprets his own word by his terms
[1:01:44] that he spoke in see Cain said I am
[1:01:47] religious I am a lover of my maker I
[1:01:49] offer thee this fine Al altar I offer to
[1:01:52] you this sacrifice Lord I built all
[1:01:54] these things up but because I love you
[1:01:57] and Abel said the same thing now it's
[1:01:59] the one that's Vindicated and the one
[1:02:02] that's proven and God come down and
[1:02:05] received Abel's sacrifice because by
[1:02:08] Revelation he had struck the CH Chanel
[1:02:12] of God Amen that was accepted listen
[1:02:15] friends what brought him to that channel
[1:02:17] it wasn't a handshake amen it wasn't a
[1:02:19] new church it was the blood come on
[1:02:22] Church the blood brought Abel into a
[1:02:24] channel where his sacrifice could be
[1:02:27] accepted in the face of his brothers
[1:02:29] being
[1:02:30] rejected oh I say to you tonight the
[1:02:32] message of the hour has reopened the
[1:02:34] true channel of Revelation in the church
[1:02:37] and the devil's done everything he can
[1:02:39] Amen to clog it up with Theology and
[1:02:42] man-made theories and problems and
[1:02:43] situations but I say God opened up the
[1:02:46] channel of the prophetic gift in this
[1:02:48] generation by the Fulfillment and the
[1:02:50] interpretation of his word and there
[1:02:52] ain't a devil big enough come on Church
[1:02:54] there ain't a devil strong long enough
[1:02:56] there ain't a devil bad enough there
[1:02:58] ain't a devil ugly enough or strong
[1:03:00] enough Amen to stop the channel that God
[1:03:02] is open in the house of
[1:03:04] God God sent this prophetic gift to the
[1:03:07] bride of Christ that is a prophetic
[1:03:10] class of people who has a prophetic womb
[1:03:12] Amen to bring forth prophetic promises

[1:03:23] your failures he said more about you
[1:03:25] than your mistakes he said more about
[1:03:27] you than your sins and than our unbelief
[1:03:29] and our oh come on church we might as
[1:03:31] well have church the prophet said more
[1:03:34] he said there is a blood and it's a
[1:03:37] powerful blood and it has the ability to
[1:03:39] wash a son and daughter of God and put
[1:03:41] them in position to bring forth the

[1:08:53] day brother so we minute times for years
[1:08:56] we got what we call a lie detector you
[1:08:58] put it on your wrist and set it across
[1:09:00] your head and you get in there and try
[1:09:02] to your best to make a lie sound like
[1:09:04] the truth it'll register negative every
[1:09:06] time because a human was not made to lie
[1:09:10] he said lying is a deceitful hard thing
[1:09:13] it's an evil thing no matter how much
[1:09:15] you try to impersonate and try to make a
[1:09:18] lie seem
[1:09:19] right they got a scientific instrument
[1:09:22] that proves that it's wrong and you can
[1:09:24] tell it with all the innoc since you
[1:09:25] want to but it's still going to register
[1:09:27] negative because there's a subconscious
[1:09:29] down in the human being and that
[1:09:31] subconscious knows what's truth and no
[1:09:34] matter what you're saying out here
[1:09:36] brother Josh that subconscious knows
[1:09:38] that it's a lie and it'll reg off of
[1:09:41] that subconscious why don't you take the
[1:09:43] word of God church and make it a lie
[1:09:46] detector and why don't you bring that
[1:09:48] lie before the word of God and let that
[1:09:50] thing die once and for alll
[1:09:55] come on folks why don't you bring it
[1:09:57] before the word and let it die one time
[1:09:59] you say how am I going to let it die
[1:10:01] I'll tell you how you going to let it
[1:10:02] die you're going to put it on the word
[1:10:04] and let the word rest through it a lie I
[1:10:06] don't care how innocent and how pretty
[1:10:08] you get that thing all concocted well my
[1:10:11] daddy was this and my mama was this and
[1:10:13] and I'm just trying to be the best I can
[1:10:15] and I can't overcome this and I can't
[1:10:17] ever be back and oh that's a lie folks
[1:10:20] but there's a y of them in the house of
[1:10:22] God there is a lie detector called the
[1:10:25] the word of God and when you start
[1:10:27] telling this word that bunch of hogwash
[1:10:29] it's going to speak out better things
[1:10:31] just like the blood of Jesus does it's
[1:10:33] going to say things like you never even
[1:10:35] done it in the first place it's going to
[1:10:37] tell you there is a sea of God's
[1:10:39] forgetfulness where the thing can be
[1:10:41] remitted and can be forgiven and can be
[1:10:44] thrown in the sea of forgetfulness never
[1:10:47] ever never ever ever to be remembered
[1:10:50] again there is a blood there is a blood
[1:10:54] folks there is a blood if a man or woman
[1:10:57] can ever get their thoughts and their
[1:10:58] testimonies and lives so lined up with
[1:11:01] God until the channel of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:04] would be perfectly one with God what
[1:11:06] would take place if a man or woman could
[1:11:08] ever get lined up there with the freedom
[1:11:10] from their hearts with Faith from the
[1:11:12] innermost listen many people come to the
[1:11:14] altar to be prayed for they have
[1:11:15] intellectual Faith they confess their
[1:11:17] sins and join a church by intellectual
[1:11:20] Faith they believe it in their mind they
[1:11:22] believe it because they heard it they
[1:11:24] believe it because they know it's the
[1:11:25] best policy but that's not what God
[1:11:27] looks at he don't look at your
[1:11:29] intellectual Faith he looks on the heart
[1:11:32] or on the inside God and when it comes
[1:11:35] from the heart all things are possible
[1:11:38] then your confession will meet up with
[1:11:40] your life and your life will speak as
[1:11:43] loud as your confession does but when
[1:11:45] your confession says one thing and your
[1:11:48] life lives another there's something
[1:11:50] wrong somewhere because you got an
[1:11:52] intellectual faith and not a Faith from
[1:11:55] from your heart amen and that's what
[1:11:57] shows the outside here is a knowledge of
[1:12:00] God but inside here is a demon of
[1:12:03] doubting let me say this one of Satan's
[1:12:06] favorite channels Amen to clog up folks
[1:12:09] is the channel of inspiration because he
[1:12:12] knows the word is always inspired no
[1:12:15] matter what I'm going through brother
[1:12:17] wend no matter what you're going through
[1:12:19] or brother Donald what you're going
[1:12:21] through sister Angie what you're going
[1:12:22] through the word is always is
[1:12:26] inspired can I say this to you brother
[1:12:28] Caleb there's never a second that the
[1:12:31] word is not inspired you do a favor for
[1:12:33] me okay take a second and split it down
[1:12:36] and break it down less than a second
[1:12:38] okay tell me later what it is I don't
[1:12:40] think you'll be able to amen it's so
[1:12:42] fast amen but can I tell you something
[1:12:44] the word is still inspired even in that
[1:12:46] little
[1:12:47] second are you hearing me in that little
[1:12:51] second the word is still inspired listen
[1:12:54] so what the devil does is the devil
[1:12:56] wants to clog the channel of your heart
[1:12:59] up to where you cannot receive the
[1:13:02] inspired word because when the two
[1:13:04] Inspirations comes together amen then
[1:13:08] you will see a result oh brother Kobe
[1:13:11] amen what could happen in this building
[1:13:13] tonight if we would let the Holy Ghost
[1:13:15] blow out the channel of inspiration in
[1:13:17] our hearts and we would say Lord amen
[1:13:20] from the corridors of Glory let the
[1:13:22] inspired word flow into this church I
[1:13:25] tell you what will happen it'll flow in
[1:13:26] your heart Josh it'll flow in your heart
[1:13:29] sister fresa it'll flow in your heart
[1:13:31] brother Caleb it'll flow all over this
[1:13:33] building and then we'll start seeing
[1:13:35] results we'll start seeing changes come
[1:13:37] but we got to say God let the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] blow Alpha Channel
[1:13:42] Lord you say brother Andrew what are you
[1:13:44] saying well I'm going to say this in the
[1:13:46] Old Testament how many will agree we're
[1:13:48] in War Sir do you know in the Old
[1:13:51] Testament amen there was a war tactic
[1:13:54] you know what that war Tac IC was it was
[1:13:56] the enemy would come in and he would
[1:13:58] stop up all the water channels because
[1:14:00] the enemy knew if he could just cut the
[1:14:03] supply of water off then the people
[1:14:06] would die the enemy knew Hey listen if I
[1:14:09] can just get them dry if I can just get
[1:14:12] them in a dry spot if I can just get
[1:14:15] them all stickery and I can get them all
[1:14:17] upset and bothered with everybody and
[1:14:19] everything if I can just get them in a
[1:14:21] dry spot there will be the death kill
[1:14:24] there will be the the place brother Luke
[1:14:26] that he'll kill the church you know what
[1:14:28] I say I say we ought to refuse to remain
[1:14:31] in a dry condition we ought to
[1:14:34] refuse amen I'm just preaching to you
[1:14:36] from my heart I didn't come to impress
[1:14:38] you I come to help you we ought to
[1:14:40] remain in the presence of God we ought
[1:14:43] to say devil I refuse to become dry I
[1:14:46] refuse to become a sticker in the house
[1:14:49] of God I'll tell you what happens when a
[1:14:50] church becomes dry it becomes unfruitful
[1:14:53] come on come on the people still there
[1:14:56] but there's no water amen listen folks
[1:14:59] somewhere we got to say God bring back
[1:15:01] the water amen well it's just Wednesday
[1:15:03] night who cares if it's Wednesday night
[1:15:05] or Tuesday night or Sunday morning or
[1:15:08] Sunday night or Friday night the water
[1:15:10] Remains the water on Monday the same as
[1:15:12] it is on Sunday we just need the water
[1:15:15] of God to flow in the Church of God
[1:15:19] againu hallelujah hallelujah the Bible
[1:15:22] said for now they died all these Wells
[1:15:24] and they kept stopping them up but they
[1:15:26] come and remove fence and they died
[1:15:28] another well and they strove not and he
[1:15:30] called the name of it raob booth and he
[1:15:32] said for now the Lord hath made room for
[1:15:35] us isn't that powerful there's been a
[1:15:37] spring cleaning amen now the Lord
[1:15:40] hallelujah now the Lord has made room
[1:15:43] for us he didn't just make room for
[1:15:45] Moses he didn't just make room for the
[1:15:47] pastor he didn't just make room for the
[1:15:49] Evangelist he made room for every single
[1:15:51] one of
[1:15:53] them and we Shout be fruitful in the
[1:15:56] land listen folks there is water in the
[1:15:58] well amen there's a place of restoration
[1:16:02] there's a place of repentance there's a
[1:16:04] place of redemption and there's a place
[1:16:06] where the waters can flow
[1:16:08] again in the public utility if you don't
[1:16:11] pay the bill they'll cut the water off
[1:16:13] and you know what'll happen you'll dry
[1:16:15] up around the house he said that's
[1:16:17] what's the matter with God's people
[1:16:18] tonight they just didn't pay the price
[1:16:20] and God cut their water off that's all
[1:16:22] go to any Desert you want to that's
[1:16:25] reason some of you Full Gospel Church
[1:16:26] members and so forth don't believe in
[1:16:28] Divine Healing your water has been cut
[1:16:31] off but now notice that's the reason out
[1:16:34] in the desert and everything you come in
[1:16:36] contact in the desert it's got stickers
[1:16:37] on it I don't care if it's a little o
[1:16:39] leaf or whatever it don't fo with it
[1:16:41] it's got a sticker on it where there's
[1:16:42] no water it gets
[1:16:45] stickers now come on Saints where
[1:16:48] there's water the same
[1:16:51] plant will soften up and make Leaves so
[1:16:55] what they done was they found out that
[1:16:56] they was without water and when you're
[1:16:59] without water you're without life when
[1:17:02] there's no water there's no life so then
[1:17:05] they said well what can we do about it
[1:17:08] now let me say this the Holy Spirit
[1:17:10] deals in a spiritual manner we don't
[1:17:13] enter the spiritual things by fear but
[1:17:16] we enter them by faith Paul said that
[1:17:18] Timothy God has not given us the spirit
[1:17:21] of fear but of power and of love and of
[1:17:25] sound mind amen the spirit of power the
[1:17:28] spirit of love and the spirit of a sound
[1:17:31] mind he said what we need then is a
[1:17:33] fresh baptism in and of the love of God
[1:17:37] listen folks Paul tells us there is
[1:17:40] Faith there is hope and there is Charity
[1:17:42] but the greatest of all is Charity amen
[1:17:45] I'll say this what we need is to allow
[1:17:48] the love of God to have the preeminence
[1:17:51] in the Church of
[1:17:52] God now I'll just go ahead and preach
[1:17:54] and I'm here I think it's time to quit
[1:17:56] seeing all the faults and failures and
[1:17:58] issues and picking nitpicking and gring
[1:18:01] amen I'll just say this Amen brother
[1:18:03] wend you can correct it when I'm gone
[1:18:05] amen I'll just say this I think it's
[1:18:06] time to love again amen I think it's
[1:18:09] time to love amen listen you don't want
[1:18:12] nobody judging you by your actions you
[1:18:14] want to be judged by your motives amen
[1:18:16] then why don't you return the same thing
[1:18:18] to somebody
[1:18:22] else Don't Judge Me by my actions Judge
[1:18:24] Me by motives this is what I meant to do
[1:18:26] and then somebody else oh God then
[1:18:28] somebody else makes a mistake and you
[1:18:30] done put them on a Hellbound train to
[1:18:33] Hell come on church but my Bible says
[1:18:37] that Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[1:18:39] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:18:42] Faith amen worketh by love listen folks
[1:18:45] you want to see more faith in the church
[1:18:47] get more love in the church amen faith
[1:18:50] is based on
[1:18:53] forgiveness now Paul says it like this
[1:18:55] he said that we would be grounded in
[1:18:57] love the prophet of God said we must
[1:18:58] approach God through that channel of
[1:19:01] love and faith I love what Paul or John
[1:19:03] says he said we have known and believed
[1:19:06] in in the love that God had to us God is
[1:19:08] love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:19:11] dwelleth in God and God in him so
[1:19:14] there's the spirit of power Sister Jesse
[1:19:17] there's the spirit of love but then
[1:19:19] there's the spirit of a sound amen mind
[1:19:22] or what the Bible would call Spirit
[1:19:24] spiritual sanity and the Bible said this
[1:19:27] the Bible said they come to Jesus and
[1:19:29] and I believe in The Book of Mark the
[1:19:30] 5th chapter the 15th verse they come to
[1:19:33] Jesus and they see him that was
[1:19:34] possessed with the devil and had the
[1:19:36] legion amen sitting en clothed and in
[1:19:40] his right mind and they were afraid now
[1:19:44] come on folks where was Jesus at when he
[1:19:47] found Legion he found Legion in the
[1:19:50] tombs do you realize Legion was a good
[1:19:52] man the Bible said he was brother
[1:19:55] brandham gave us some insight on his
[1:19:56] life and said he was a family man he was
[1:19:59] a hard worker amen he loved his wife and
[1:20:02] he loved his babies he said but he made
[1:20:04] a mistake and he said instead of coming
[1:20:06] home and making that thing is this all
[1:20:08] right instead of coming home and making
[1:20:10] that thing right you know what he said
[1:20:12] he said this he went in and told a lie
[1:20:15] and he said he went out the next day and
[1:20:16] he come back do you realize something
[1:20:18] brother Kobe Every Lie he told was
[1:20:21] matter accumulating in his channels
[1:20:24] Every Lie he told amen so clogged his
[1:20:27] channels up to the love of God had to
[1:20:29] pursue him in a
[1:20:32] graveyard are you hearing me folks quit
[1:20:35] underestimating the power of a devil
[1:20:37] don't you ever underestimate the power
[1:20:39] of a spirit listen to me spirits will
[1:20:42] take you places you never thought you
[1:20:43] would go demons will drive you places
[1:20:46] you never thought you would find
[1:20:48] yourself come on I'm just going to
[1:20:50] preach amen the devil drove him there
[1:20:53] because his heart got all
[1:20:56] clogged oh the pr of God said when I got
[1:20:59] outside Brother Moore said to me brother
[1:21:00] random that Maniac you had in his right
[1:21:02] mind after he got healed was going down
[1:21:04] the street acting like a maniac again
[1:21:06] running hard and screaming glory to God
[1:21:08] and everything I said well he was just
[1:21:10] clothed in his right mind then to
[1:21:13] worship see Jesus give him his right
[1:21:15] mind to worship he was crazy then to the
[1:21:18] people again because he had received his
[1:21:21] right mind listen when the channel got
[1:21:24] uncocked
[1:21:25] oh God when the channel got unclogged he
[1:21:28] could experience the love of God again
[1:21:30] he could experience the worship of God
[1:21:33] again he could experience the praise of
[1:21:35] God listen the Bible said that he had so
[1:21:37] scared his family that when he went home
[1:21:40] amen they ran and hid from himen I like
[1:21:42] that old song and then y'all probably
[1:21:44] heard at the Cathedral singing I ain't
[1:21:46] that old man no more amen ain't F old
[1:21:49] man no more amen why was he changed
[1:21:52] because he met Jesus and Jesus performed
[1:21:55] a spiritual heart surgery on the man and
[1:21:58] he was changed and there was a love of
[1:22:00] God flowing through his channels there
[1:22:02] was the inspiration flowing again what
[1:22:04] are you saying oh God I'm saying there's
[1:22:07] a chance it can happen again it can
[1:22:09] happen again I don't care how hard the
[1:22:12] arteries have become there's a
[1:22:13] possibility for the love of God and the
[1:22:16] peace of God there's a possibility for
[1:22:19] the waters to flow
[1:22:21] again we must allow we must allow the
[1:22:24] Holy Spirit to unclog the channel of
[1:22:27] Faith listen the devil loves to clog the
[1:22:29] channel of our purpose hear me now he
[1:22:33] loves to clog the channel of our Purpose
[1:22:36] with our
[1:22:38] failures he loves to do it sis he loves
[1:22:41] to clog the channels of our Purpose with
[1:22:44] the failures of our Humanity brother
[1:22:47] said what are we anyhow how do we get
[1:22:49] here what are we here for did you ever
[1:22:51] think of those things we are human
[1:22:53] beings what made us human beings what
[1:22:56] made us different from anything else on
[1:22:57] Earth as human beings listen folks I
[1:22:59] tell you what done it the purpose of God
[1:23:02] come on the purpose of God goes beyond
[1:23:05] amen our human purpose because the
[1:23:08] purpose of God brother Joe is an eternal
[1:23:11] purpose the purpose of God is
[1:23:14] irresistible I love this it is sure of
[1:23:17] fulfillment it is seen in his choice of
[1:23:19] instruments it is revealed in the gospel
[1:23:22] it is eternal in Christ I love this
[1:23:24] church and it is involving the
[1:23:27] overthrowing of
[1:23:29] Satan did y'all hear that the Eternal
[1:23:33] purpose of God Amen we ought to post
[1:23:35] that on our on our refrigerators is
[1:23:37] irresistible brother Merl it is sure of
[1:23:39] fulfillment it is seen in his choice of
[1:23:42] instruments it is revealed in the gospel
[1:23:46] it is eternal in Christ and it involves
[1:23:49] the overthrow of Satan when God chose
[1:23:52] you Samson he did not choose you to be
[1:23:55] defeated by the ones that he raised you
[1:23:57] up to
[1:24:00] defeat I love what Isaiah said the Lord
[1:24:02] of hosts is purposed and who shall disol
[1:24:04] it his hand is stretched out and who
[1:24:06] shall turn it back Jeremiah says the
[1:24:09] land shall tremble in sorrow for every
[1:24:12] purpose of the Lord shall be performed
[1:24:15] against Babylon to make the land of
[1:24:17] Babylon a desolation without an
[1:24:22] inhabitant my the Bible prophesied that
[1:24:26] when God got done with Babylon there
[1:24:28] wouldn't even be a person left to
[1:24:30] inhabit
[1:24:31] it the Bible prophesied when God got
[1:24:34] done with Babylon brother brother Miguel
[1:24:37] there wouldn't even be a Babylon and
[1:24:39] there wouldn't be nobody to inhabited
[1:24:41] there wouldn't even be nobody to rebuild
[1:24:42] it oh I feel like shouting right there
[1:24:45] church brother Ken I feel like shouting
[1:24:47] right there that God prophesied when I
[1:24:50] get done with you I'm going to destroy
[1:24:52] your enemies I'm going to destroy their
[1:24:54] complexes I'm going to destroy the Devil
[1:24:57] who pulled you into that failure who
[1:24:59] pulled you into that mistake there's not
[1:25:01] even going to be anybody
[1:25:04] left hallu hallelujah hallelujah I have
[1:25:08] appeared from thee under thee for a
[1:25:10] purpose Paul to make thee a minister and
[1:25:14] to witness now notice this we were
[1:25:17] created for a purpose to control to rule
[1:25:19] to praise God do you know the Bible said
[1:25:22] that we were made do you realize the
[1:25:25] Bible said this the Bible says we were
[1:25:27] made to be in the Dominion in the image
[1:25:29] of God you know what the problem of God
[1:25:31] said he said it like this he said man
[1:25:34] was made as a secondary God on the earth
[1:25:36] he was given power to control all things
[1:25:38] Adam was given these great Powers but
[1:25:40] then the power he was given to make
[1:25:42] yourself is where he fell now watch this
[1:25:47] Adam fell by freem moral agency and I'll
[1:25:51] just go ahead and say it it has caused
[1:25:52] us more trouble than we realize
[1:25:56] Adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:25:57] could stop he could speak to trees and
[1:25:59] they would obey him he said but now
[1:26:01] though the fall through the fall he lost
[1:26:04] that power then he becomes unconscious
[1:26:07] of the fact after losing his
[1:26:10] relationship and friendship and
[1:26:12] fellowship with the father then he lost
[1:26:14] that and all of his great channels
[1:26:17] become clogged
[1:26:19] up and he
[1:26:21] couldn't get through
[1:26:24] all these channels brother sister has
[1:26:27] become clogged up now what Adam was in
[1:26:29] God Christ has redeemed us back to that
[1:26:33] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:26:35] bring it back to its origin again Satan
[1:26:40] knows he will never defeat God so he is
[1:26:44] always attacking the closest thing to
[1:26:47] God he will never defeat the people of
[1:26:51] God but he's always attacking them
[1:26:54] because he knows they are the closest
[1:26:57] thing to
[1:26:59] God are you hearing me that's why if the
[1:27:02] devil can't get a preacher he goes after
[1:27:05] his wife and if he can't get his wife he
[1:27:07] goes after his babies and if he can't
[1:27:09] get his babies he starts going after his
[1:27:11] church because he's trying to find
[1:27:14] somewhere he can wiggle his way in and
[1:27:17] clog up the channel and stop the water
[1:27:19] from flowing in that church in other
[1:27:22] words all of the plumbing in the brain
[1:27:24] and the outlets and Faith had been
[1:27:26] clogged up with business Affair and home
[1:27:28] life and domestic things he said it's
[1:27:30] all become so clogged up that God can't
[1:27:32] operate through those channels that he
[1:27:34] made a man for but God so patterned the
[1:27:36] man the body of man then how much more
[1:27:39] has he patterned and set in order the
[1:27:41] body of Christ the church now you know
[1:27:43] what the prophet of God said the prophet
[1:27:45] of God said God has confidence in
[1:27:47] us he says there and reads a scripture
[1:27:50] where the Bible says in Colossians 2:15

[1:29:12] show of them openly amen Trum over them
[1:29:16] in
[1:29:18] it that's the god of David hey
[1:29:21] Hallelujah glory to God that's the god
[1:29:23] of David that he saido not hide my

[1:30:30] got a sword against you folks amen your

[1:30:35] when God died he disarmed our mistakes
[1:30:39] he disarmed our failures he disarmed our
[1:30:44] shortcomings and the only thing that hum
[1:30:46] that hindered the human race today from
[1:30:49] being Superior and controlling like they
[1:30:51] did in the beginning is because the
[1:30:53] power line to the outlet of God man the
[1:30:55] human being has been clogged up but the
[1:30:59] Holy Ghost is here he said to pass
[1:31:01] through the human heart by faith once
[1:31:04] again it takes more than water baptism
[1:31:07] to unclog those channels Saints it takes
[1:31:09] the power Ephesians 4 there's a
[1:31:11] five-fold Ministry I'll just say it
[1:31:13] because it's pretty fitting to say it
[1:31:14] here there's a five-fold Ministry of
[1:31:18] electricians and they're wiring the
[1:31:20] spiritual building of the body of Christ
[1:31:22] and he said when you get to a place
[1:31:23] place you're perfectly wired and the
[1:31:25] master electrician has okayed it by
[1:31:27] sealing it with the Holy Spirit the only
[1:31:29] thing is just turn on the switch then
[1:31:32] and there'll be a light show or flow

[1:43:28] fire thinking you ain't going to get
[1:43:29] burnt come on folks come on Saints you

[1:43:34] you're in you're a channel you're a
[1:43:37] channel in the body listen I'll just go
[1:43:39] ahead and say it for myself God forbid
[1:43:41] as Paul said that I should become a
[1:43:43] Castaway after the things I've preached
[1:43:46] I know I know we may not be shouting
[1:43:48] right now this ain't a shouting sermon
[1:43:49] but it's a digging sermon and I tell you
[1:43:51] why the devil wants us to skip services
[1:43:53] like this is because he knows the
[1:43:56] possibilities of a church that'll begin
[1:43:58] to dig again he knows if the water comes
[1:44:01] it's the same water that was with Israel
[1:44:04] it's the same water that was with Moses
[1:44:07] and it's right here with this
[1:44:10] church Samson stood there and you all
[1:44:14] know the
[1:44:15] story Delilah pressed on him daily I
[1:44:19] hope that's
[1:44:20] okay Delilah pressed on him daily and
[1:44:23] pressed on him daily and pressed on him
[1:44:25] daily Spirit of the Lord was upon him
[1:44:29] let me say this and and and and you get
[1:44:31] mad at me if you want to but every time
[1:44:33] that Samson laid his head in Delilah's
[1:44:36] lap he accumulated more matter in the
[1:44:39] channel every time he laid his head in
[1:44:42] Delilah's lap he was accumulating and
[1:44:44] clogging the channel oh Church to the
[1:44:46] point the water couldn't even get to him
[1:44:49] the muscles were there the Covenant was
[1:44:51] there the hair was there but one mistake
[1:44:54] amen he let his secret slip one time and
[1:44:57] Delila cut off his hair oh church I'm
[1:44:59] going to say it to you don't you let the
[1:45:01] devil cut your hair off don't you let
[1:45:04] the devil strip you and leave you
[1:45:05] powerless I say this I know it's old
[1:45:07] fashioned but hear me daddies get them
[1:45:10] altars back open in the house of God
[1:45:12] momy get them books back open shut off
[1:45:15] that stupid cell phone and raise them
[1:45:17] babies in the fear and admonition of
[1:45:21] God I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm probably
[1:45:24] getting out of line here
[1:45:26] but are you hearing me we need some
[1:45:29] water we need some water our young
[1:45:32] people got to have some
[1:45:38] water and Samson laid
[1:45:41] there and theila come right in and cut
[1:45:45] off his
[1:45:47] hair
[1:45:50] now I say this to you
[1:45:54] he laid
[1:45:56] there and she cut his hair off and she
[1:45:59] said Samson the Philistines be upon
[1:46:03] you brother Wendell you know that you
[1:46:05] preached
[1:46:06] it he woke up as any other
[1:46:10] man brother joshu woke
[1:46:13] up muscle still
[1:46:15] there Covenant was still
[1:46:18] spoken but there was no power
[1:46:24] you know what he did and this is what
[1:46:26] I'm closing on right here tonight
[1:46:27] because this is what the Lord spoke to
[1:46:29] my heart today you know what he did he
[1:46:32] said hey he said one of you young
