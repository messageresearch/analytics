I know [singing] I'll be just fine. He knows my name. [applause] I got to take a minute. This is not working. [clears throat] Nothing like listening to somebody tune. Battle scars and bruises they hardly count as cost. As victors fist the spoils the enemy has lost. Lifeless foes lay scattered on the cold and stony ground. Triumphant trumpet calls. The soldiers home word bound. Oh, look up. Redemption draw with nine. &gt;&gt; We're going out [singing] to meet him in the early eastern sky. We'll lay down our battle armor in [music] righteous robes. We'll sing &gt;&gt; forever. Praises to the Lord. He's Jesus, [music and singing] victorious king.

If you have your if you have your Bibles, why don't we just turn here uh to Revelations 19 and 7. Uh we're missing uh several this morning.

Trust everyone had a good time. a wonderful time with your families. Um, you know, this time of the year is usually when uh a a lot of you know, a lot of jobs stop and and uh so it's a good time for for for fellowship with families and and so we had we had a wonderful time uh there at the house ourselves and my wife's family uh came to Pawne and so that was really nice. Praise the Lord. Um, so also got to see Brother Joe. I guess I we we weren't here on Tuesday night. Was with brother Patrick and Sister Stacia and um uh so we but we got to eat breakfast with them yesterday and and uh that so that was wonderful to see them. Amen. Let's look here at at Revelations 19 and7 just one verse. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor uh to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to say thank you today for your goodness and your blessings. Lord, as as we um enjoyed the song service and enjoyed the specials, Lord, and and Father, we want you to to be everything to us. We want you to be expressed through us. And we just ask, Lord, that you would be here in a real special way this morning. Lord, I pray that you'd meet every need that is here. Lord, we know that you It's not in numbers. It's not in it's not in our efforts. It's in your presence. And Father, we want to yield ourselves to you this morning. Both the speaker and the hearer. And Lord God, I pray that the presence of your spirit, Lord, would would so touch hearts and lives both present and online, Father. And we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here today. Amen. So we um uh I'm wanting to just continue my thought. I guess um from from this last week and um I know uh last week was sort of a a strange Christmas message um but yet that's the that is the message. Amen. And that's God becoming flesh and the the word uh being made flesh, the eternal God. Amen. Becoming a man. And um so we we sort of dealt last week with Amen. Uh and just giving just laying in the scriptures. Amen. That that he Christ is not uh a second person of the Godhead, but Christ is God. Amen. He is God. He is um he is every bit. Amen. There is uh God created a body and God uh moved into that body. And and if you don't understand the Godhead the way that you should understand the Godhead, then you're not going to really truly catch the the real beauty of redemption. And so we talked about this Christ child. And last week we had asked, "Amen. Who is this mysterious child?" Amen. He was God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, Amen. Brother Brandham would tell us about a dream that he had had is, you know, his supposed mother being beat by his supposed father. Neither of them were his natural mom and dad, but Amen. Uh and and you know it had a uh this this man had a three- cornered stick and he was taking her by the hair of the head and just beating her down with it. And every time she had tried to rise back up, he had beat her back down. And &gt;&gt; and and um Amen. and and he would say that the that the church being beat down by trinitarianism &gt;&gt; and and and you know if you separate the one true God into three different uh gods, you miss the actual um reality of revelation of Jesus Christ because Jesus uh becoming was God becoming tangible. Amen. He come in order to redeem his germ thoughts. He come to express himself upon earth. And and so Amen. You you you you can only reflect God and and and and give yourself to God as you understand the real revelation of your salvation. You've got to understand the real revelation of of why you've been saved. And and so, Brother Brandham, the the as soon as he had woke up from the dream, the presence of the Lord come into the room and and and revealed to him the the the interpretation. And he said, "The woman represents the church of the world today. And I was born right into this mess, the mess that she's in. and and she was supposed to be of kind of a mother. Amen. But she is the mother of harlots and her husband is the denominations that rule her. And the three cornered uh block is the the false triune baptism unto a trinity. And every time she started to rise up, that means the congregations begin to accept the truth. He would drive her right back down again with that false doctrine. And he was so big that I was afraid of him at first. But when I came against him, I found I had great and powerful muscles. They were faith muscles. The outlet uh the outcome of the dream was that uh since God is with me and can give me such strength, then let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her. Now, I'm not trying to build a doctrine upon a dream, nor am I trying to vindicate any doctrine I stand for by a dream. The oneness of the Godhead is all the way through from Genesis 1:1 to Revelations 22:21. But the people have been blinded by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity. And that dogma is so universally accepted to uh that to try to see a one god person is all but impossible. But if people can't get can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it, they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for the seven ages. Did you get it? Now, I hope you or I'm sure you understand. So, so the prophet is letting us know. Amen. It's not it's Amen. We It's not a one God opinion versus a trinitarian opinion. It this isn't this isn't about opinions. This isn't about doctrines. This is understanding the real purpose of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is God becoming visible. GOD COMING DOWN in as and being a human. Can you say amen? AMEN. SO, SO WHY AMEN. DOES DOES SATAN distort the name of that one true God? Amen. He he he he does it. He attacks the deity of God. He attacks the body in which God lives in. Now, I I want us TO TO TO REALLY STOP BECAUSE this morning I I want to talk Amen. That mysterious child, Amen. came for a purpose and that was to be married. Amen. He come to be married to a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and and so you are part of that equation. JUST AS THAT BODY, THAT LITTLE baby in a MANGER WAS WAS SO MYSTERIOUS. It was so mysterious. So is the bride to the church. Amen. The church world looks at you and looks at me and and we look and WE WE WE'RE SO MYSTERIOUS AS TO WHY WE STAND OUT, BUT we are in covenant with the one who has called us. Well, can you say amen? So, I want to read you a few more quotes here as we get started. uh uh brother brother Brandham WOULD SAY NOW GOD'S SECRET MYSTERY he had before the world began. Now back in the back of uh part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve. He had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed. SO GOD IS IS DESIRING TO BE EXPRESSED. AMEN. We understand he was the great pillar of fire. HE WOULD COME AND REVEAL himself in in in a human form to Abraham. He would reveal himself in a human form to Moses. He would reveal himself in a human form in the fiery furnace. The these were THESE WERE LITTLE THEOPHANES. THESE WERE GOD SAYING, "I'M GOING TO COME TO EARTH &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO HAVE a race. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO COME. I'M GOING TO LIVE IN HUMAN BEINGS. And there's going TO BE A GOD RACE. WELL, praise the Lord. Can you imagine God going to work? CAN YOU IMAGINE GOD RAISING A FAMILY? Can you CAN YOU IMAGINE? YOU SAY, "WELL, THAT THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE." BUT YOU ARE THE TABERNACLE OF GOD. You are the very tabernacle that God has come and is living in. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He would say in another place, if people can't see the truth of the Godhead, I believe I just read that to you, they they'll they'll never see the rest of the truth because the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for the seven ages. Amen. Another place he would say that revelation is opening up to bring us strength. Now, IT'S IMPOS IT'S IMPORTANT. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO SEE WHAT GOD IS, WHAT HE'S DOING. NOW WATCH THIS. Look how this revelation how powerful it is. That revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name. It was in the midst of the last two churches or the two ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us. Yes, we knew he was God. How else could he be our savior? BUT TO KNOW THAT he was only GOD OR GOD ALONE, THAT HE WAS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. THAT THIS JESUS was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ, the father, son, and holy ghost, all one person. That's that had been lost since the first church ages. But now we are seeing it again. The revelation of who he was has come back. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "BUT THE REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD IS BACK and the true church can build in strength again." &gt;&gt; The revelation, Amen. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND the revelation, AMEN. THAT IT WAS GOD [screaming] DESCENDING. GOD'S DESIRE TO COME DOWN. GOD WANTING TO BE ONE OF YOU. YOU WILL ALWAYS LOOK at him as as something contrary to you. YOU CONTRARY TO GOD. YOU ARE NOT CONTRARY TO GOD. YOU ARE HIS very love. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS VERY HEARTBEAT. YOU YOU [screaming] ARE EVERYTHING TO HIM. WELL, glory be to God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO CHRIST, AMEN. GREAT IS THE mystery of godliness. God made manifest in the flesh. So So the mystery of the godhead is is is one of the greatest thing. BUT IT'S THE ONE OMNIPOTENT SPIRIT MANIFESTED IN FATHERHOOD, SPIRIT GOD IN SUNSHIP, SPIRIT GOD IN A BODY AS A REDEEMER. AND THE HOLY GHOST, CHRIST, THE HOLY SPIRIT in a redeemed bride. &gt;&gt; Now, the shepherds, Amen, those years ago were beside themselves because here here come Amen. the angels and telling them that the baby was going to be born in Bethlehem and and it will be happening, amen, in a he'll be in a manger and he'll be in in swaddling clothes. And the Bible says that when they got to them, amen there in in in Luke 2 and 20, the shepherds returned glorifying, praising God for all the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. God's word coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. The shepherds HAD HEARD IT, BUT WHEN THEY SEEN GOD'S WORD COMING TO PASS, it anchored something in their heart. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MARY, WHEN MARY WAS HEARD, WHEN THE ANGEL COME TO HER, AMEN. And and and and HE TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE THIS CHRIST CHILD AND IT WOULD BE GOD WITH US. And and and then he THEN HE SAYS AND AND TO COMFORT YOUR HEART AND TO LET YOU KNOW. HALLELUJAH. He says, "You go talk to Elizabeth and she'll be of child." And Amen. And and and then the angel appears to Joseph in a dream. And Amen. AND THEN THE PROOF BEGIN TO GROW in her belly. AND A AND THE STAR FOLLOWED THEM TO BETHLEHEM. YOU SEE, THESE WERE THINGS IT WAS THEY COULD GO BACK TO AND ANCHOR IN THEIR HEART that yes indeed, I'm the girl. &gt;&gt; And I I I I want that to really resonate to you here today. I want you to be able to look in the scriptures and to SEE THE PRESENT DAY TRUTH TO SEE GOD SENDING A PROPHET TO SEE AMEN EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS INVESTED AND CALCULATE THEM AND PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND SAY yes indeed I'm THE GIRL. I'M THE ONE THAT HE HAS COME FOR. OH, glory to God. I don't have to guess. I DON'T HAVE TO WISH. I DON'T I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT MY FAILURES. I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT MY INABILITIES. I'M GOING TO ACCEPT God's word concerning me. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. The Bible says that she pondered and hid these things in her heart. She thought about them, meditated. Well, glory to the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Jesus was that mystery even to his disciples. You know there there Philip says it would suffice us if you I if you would show us the father and he says have I been so long a time with you Philillip and you still don't know who I am. He that hath seen me hath seen the father. &gt;&gt; I'M AN EXPRESSION OF THE FATHER. WELL CAN YOU SAY AMEN? And then he looks at him. Amen. There in in in John 14 and 10. Amen. HE SAYS, "BELIEVEST THOU that I am in the Father and the Father in me. The words that I speak unto you, I speak NOT OF MYSELF, BUT THE FATHER THAT DWELLS IN ME, HE DOETH THE WORKS." SO WHILE THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY GOD IN THAT BODY, God was in that body. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only problem was in that day or the only good thing about it was in that day, Jesus had a revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; Jesus could look right there and says, "I don't care what the rest of you say. I AND MY FATHER are one." AND GOD'S WANTING THAT SAME KIND OF A FAITH IN YOU. I [screaming] AND MY FATHER ARE ONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, the devils are telling you you're not bride. Devil's telling you, you know, you you won't make the rapture, BUT YOU STAND RIGHT UP AND SAY, "LISTEN, MY FATHER DWELLS IN ME. THE PRESENCE OF [screaming] GOD HAS APPEARED TO ME. I AM EVERYTHING THAT HE SAYS I AM." &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, the fullness of the of the Godhead bodily, amen, in Christ. Hebrews 1 and3 it says he who BEING THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS glory and the express image of his person. So he was the express image. Hallelujah. That little Galilean, that little carpenter son. He was the express he was the perfect image of the invisible God. Can you say amen? Amen. COLOSSIANS 1 AND 15. WHO IS the image of the invisible God. JU UH JOHN 1:18, "NO MAN HATH SEEN God at any time, the only begotten uh son which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him." &gt;&gt; Okay. Now in our in our uh church age when God was wanting to reveal uh himself he's his first words there in Revelations 3 and14 unto the angel of the church of the leotans write these things saith THE AMEN THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE witness the beginning of the creation of God. Now, now brother Brandham would would tell us that man uh uh that this scripture is saying that God created Jesus and that or yes that that that God created uh you know him first before he created uh the creation and and and thus it would make him lower than the Godhead and then this first creation which would be Jesus and then he would he would create the universe. But brother Brandham would tell us God did not create God. &gt;&gt; God God did not create God. God created a body. &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED A BODY for him &gt;&gt; to live in. &gt;&gt; Just like you build a house for you to live in, God created a house, a tabernacle, a body. so that he could live in. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. Amen. Is that right? And all THINGS WERE CREATED BY HIM, and without him was not anything created. So, SO HE'S THE SAME ONE IN GENESIS 1 AND1 WHO SAYS, "AND IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS and the earth." IT'S THAT SAME ONE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO, BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US HE IS the beginner or he is the author of the creation of God. And and and AND HE WOULD SAY THAT GOD COULDN'T REVEAL HIMSELF IN THESE IN THIS MYSTERIOUS WAY. AMEN. REMOVE ALL the mystery until the very last church age. &gt;&gt; And then, amen. HE WOULD REVEAL HIMSELF IN A greater measure because he wants this church to know who she is. &gt;&gt; And the only WAY YOU CAN KNOW WHO YOU are is not looking in the MIRROR AND NOT FOLLOWING YOUR 23 AND ME AND NOT DOING THESE THINGS TO TO FIND YOUR NATURAL GENETICS. God wants you to know you have an origin &gt;&gt; that is greater than anything here of this earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Now, that you you've got an origin that is Well, Praise the Lord. I I I like that. Amen. I'm getting older and fatter and Amen. You You go down and look, you look Amen. My my my grandfa was heavy. My grandma was heavy. My daddy's heavy. Amen. and and and and and you know uh my my my grand my grandmother's mother was heavy and and and uh I'm heavy and and so uh uh you know so we fight those things, you know, and you can look back through our genetics and and there's just a lot of things I see in me that I wish I could scrub out, but I can't scrub it out. It's it's part of who I AM. &gt;&gt; WELL, COME ON. a lot of your complexes you have here. Amen. Sitting here this morning is because of your genetics. &gt;&gt; A lot of THE THINGS THAT YOU GO THROUGH AND and and and you you you just SOMETIMES OUR MIND FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE AND IT ALL GOES BACK THROUGH YOUR GENETICS. BUT WHEN GOD COMES IN AND SAYS, "LISTEN, AMEN. I HAVE GOT ANOTHER CREATION." AND HE'S NOT DEALING, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS WHEN HE SAID THAT HE IS THE HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE CREATION OF GOD. HE SAYS HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THE OLD CREATION AT THE BEGINNING NECESSARILY. HE'S TALKING ABOUT A CREATION OF HIMSELF, A BODY OF HIMSELF. [screaming] THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE THAT HE is going to live in. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. So, he's the author or the beginner of the creation of God. Hallelujah. He says this is a completely different creation than that which was immen 6,000 years ago. He says this is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created HIS OWN BRIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND this mysterious one that WAS LAYING IN THE MANGER CAME FOR A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO express himself and to have children. Well, glory to God. Now, amen. Brother Brandham would say, "As the spirit of God, he come down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born." I WANT TO REPEAT THAT. He created the very cells in the womb of of Mary for that body. It was not enough THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT TO simply uh give life to a human oam supplied by Mary. That would have been SINFUL MANKIND PRODUCING A BODY. But that would not have uh produced the last Adam of him. It was said, "Lo, A BODY THOU FATHER prepared to me." SO GOOD. NOT GOD, NOT MARY PROVIDED that body. Mary was the human incubator and SHE CARRIED THE HOLY child and brought him to birth. Now I want you to catch that now BECAUSE THE NEW BIRTH IS THE SAME WAY. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS NOT DEPENDENT UPON MARY. GOD CHOSE MARY TO GIVE BIRTH TO THAT CHILD. ARE YOU HEARING me &gt;&gt; now? He says it was a God man. He was he WAS THE SON OF GOD. HE WAS THE VERY CREATION THE the He was of the new creation. Man and God met and joined. He was the first of this new race. He is the head of this new race. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT US TO JUST JUST STOP. AND I I I'M GOING TO I you know, and I should have said at the beginning, none of this is going to BE NEW, BUT I WANT YOU TO CONNECT THIS WITH CHRISTMAS. I want you to connect you sitting here AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT TOOK PLACE. AMEN. When with that baby in the manger, IT WAS GOD WORKING HIS way into the human race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now, now there in Colossians 1:8, it says, "He is the head of the body, the church." Amen. Who is the beginning, the firstborn uh from the dead, THAT IN ALL THINGS HE MIGHT HAVE PREEMINENCE. WELL, bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if any man, and you can put those scriptures up, any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Oh, things have PASSED AWAY, BEHOLD, ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW. CAN you say amen? So, so though man was of the older order, the older creation, God is saying there is a new creation and it's going to be my very own bride. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just stay with me a little bit longer and then we're going to get into the good stuff. Hallelujah. Ephesians 2:10. We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus. Now, now here here is here is what the original says. Created in union with Christ Jesus unto good works. So everything that you are, Amen. in your in your Christian walk is found in that Christ child. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now when Jesus when Jesus was teaching his disciples to pray and he started out our father who art in heaven. Now Jesus spoke it's it's it's uh he he spoke uh uh uh how do you spell that? Uh hallelujah. Am a r a m a i c. Aramaic. That's what I'm trying to say. Amen. That was the that was the language there in the in the Galilee. And so most of the scholars believe that when he taught them to pray, Amen. our father. Now we have in there the Abba, Abba, father, daddy, papa. Amen. But the original it was the abun. Amen. Our abun who art in heaven. And and it's and it's quite an incredible thing because Amen. Um, abw blends father ab with womb. The word womb means womb. Womb. Womb of a woman. It puts the masculine and the feminine together. So, so when he was praying, Amen. the ab masculine wound feminine. Amen. Ab wound is mother father. Now, I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS for them and and because I'm I'm getting to A TO A PLACE. GOD WANTING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. HE COULD NOT JUST EXPRESS HIMSELF IN the deity form of Jesus Christ. HE HAD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN THE DEITY FORM THROUGH A WOMAN. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. SEE, WE WANT TO PUT IT ALL IN JESUS. BUT AND AND AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TRINITY THING, you're you're you're just YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT THIS SLOTMENT. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND IT IS GOD [screaming] IN us living his life. &gt;&gt; Now I thought this was this was in in incredible because the abun amen is that Aramaic word amen is not just a loose word. Now it you know father hearing it's it's just hard. They say it's hard for the English language to just really pick that up, but it conveys a deep intimacy and respect. Amen. And and and and IT'S IT'S IT'S FAR MORE AFFECTIONATE THAN THAN just the word daddy. AMEN. AND AND SO AS AS [screaming] GOD, HE IS THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE. AMEN. We sing the song. He's my mother. He's my father. He's my brother. He's my sister. He is all in all to me. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. He appeared unto Abraham and and he SAYS, "I AM EL SHADAI." &gt;&gt; WELL, EL SHADAI IS THE ALMIGHTY GOD, THE BREASTED GOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he was telling he was telling Abraham, "Amen, you're weak. You're old. Your name is Abram. You you've gone these these these many years waiting on a promise. Amen. Won't you come and take hold of my breasts? I've given you." Amen. Nurse on MY PROMISES. NURSE. I I'M GOING TO NURSE. TAKE MY words into your being. And the Bible says just a few VERSES DOWN, GOD CHANGED HIS name and made him well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AFTER HE TOOK THE PROMISES OF GOD, HE SAYS, "TAKE HOLD OF MY BREAST. TAKE HOLD OF MY PROMISES." AMEN. AND AND NURSE YOURSELF A STRENGTH. I KNOW YOU'RE OLD. I KNOW YOU'RE INCAPABLE, BUT I WANT YOU TO TAKE these promises. And by the way, Abram, amen, fatherless, your name is going to be called Abraham because you're going to be a father of many nations. &gt;&gt; SO, IT WAS GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN THE FORM OF A WOMAN. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He had it in him. &gt;&gt; Abom, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You know when God created Adam? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He created him in his own image. &gt;&gt; Good point. &gt;&gt; And when he created Adam, Adam had feminine and MASCULINE IN THE BODY. WELL, glory to God. &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS PREGNANT with Eve. Yeah, [laughter] &gt;&gt; ADAM HAD EVE ON THE INSIDE [screaming] OF HIM. &gt;&gt; ADAM WAS LIVING IN PERFECTION, BUT ADAM WAS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL HE COULD EXPRESS. [screaming] OH, GLORY TO GOD. GOD THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE. GOD THE [screaming] ALL AND ALL THE PERFECT GOD COULD NOT BE COMPLETE UNTIL HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CHRISTMAS IS. AMEN. UNDERSTANDING THE [screaming] EXPRESSION OF GOD. YEAH, &gt;&gt; there's no wonder when Jesus was laying there in [laughter] in the manger that angels from the highest heavens came down. Amen. PROCLAIMING PROCLAIMING TO THE SHEPHERDS. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS A GREAT HOST OF ANGELIC BEINGS COME MAGNIFYING AND WORSHIPING GOD. WHY? THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION. YEAH, &gt;&gt; that was Jehovah laying in that manger. &gt;&gt; That was Jehovah that the cows were &gt;&gt; loing at, &gt;&gt; the sheep were banging at. Well, praise the Lord. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, but that was not the Oh, that's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning. This Christ child would become the word in flesh. This This one would redeem you and me. Well, bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, amen. Adam was like his father. Hallelujah. When he created him, he created him with Eve in him. Male and female created he them according to Genesis 1:27. Amen. So, he he was like his father. Amen. He was male and female. Hallelujah. He was living in perfection. Well, glory to God. He was walking and talking with God already in the cool of the evening. And and it and IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THAT RIGHT RIGHT THERE IN THE SAME SCRIPTURES WHERE HE'S SAYING he's naming the animals. AMEN. GOD HAD JUST MADE FROM THE DIRT AND NOW GOD HAS HIM MAKING THE ANIMALS AND HE'S AND HE'S LOOKING AT THE TWO BY TWOS AND HE'S DOING ALL OF THIS. AND THEN GOD LOOKED AT ADAM and he seen Adam was lonely &gt;&gt; and and and Adam needed well praise the Lord. And he says, "It's not good that man should be alone, and I will make him a helpmate for him." Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God, WE WE YOU KNOW, AND AND AGAIN, THIS IS ALL THIS IS ALL this is this is all old stuff for y'all. I understand. But God didn't take new dirt like he done everything else. HE REACHED INSIDE OF Adam &gt;&gt; and HE PULLED EVE OUT of Adam &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK THAT FEMININE SPIRIT OUT OF ADAM AND HE PUT IT IN THIS NEW creation &gt;&gt; by the name of Adam. You see, Adam was Adam and so was Mrs. Adam. &gt;&gt; She didn't become Eve until she had her first baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Eve, Adam, WELL, WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO ADAM WAS LAYING THERE. GOD [screaming] PULLED THE RIB, CREATED THE WOMAN. AMEN. BROUGHT THE THE FEMININE SPIRIT, PUT IT UPON HER, AND CALLED HER ADAM. And and and and and this IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT G THIS IS WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. AMEN. Genesis 2 and 21. AND THE LORD CAUSED INDEED SLEEP TO FALL UPON ADAM, AND HE SLEPT. AND HE TOOK ONE OF HIS RIBS, AND CLOSED UP THE FLESH INSTEAD THEREOF. AND THE RIB WHICH THE LORD HAD TAKEN from the man, he made a woman and brought her unto the man. AND WHAT DID ADAM [screaming] SAY? AMEN. THIS IS BONE OF MY BONE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS FLESH OF [screaming] MY FLESH. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man. When I think about Christ, this mysterious one, THIS ONE THAT GOD HAD CREATED, THIS BODY, now Christ, think about it now. Amen. Think about it. Within Adam was that woman. He was carrying the woman. All the feminist qualities were residing in him. They came from him. Can you say amen? ADAM WAS PREGNANT WITH PROMISE AND [screaming] SO WAS JESUS PREGNANT WITH PROMISE. &gt;&gt; For the bride Jesus bride was in him. All all of the all of THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD, ALL OF THE DNA, ALL EVERY SON, EVERY ALL [screaming] OF THOSE thoughts that were in the mind of God were now in the body of Jesus. You know what that means, Sister Angie? You were there then. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] Brother Donald, you were there that Jesus. Hallelujah. Probably shouldn't preach this kind of stuff on the internet, but Jesus was pregnant with promise. He had you in him. Jesus had to go to Calvary. When Jesus went to Calvary, you were there in him. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to hell, you were there in him. When Jesus rose from the dead, you were there. As Eve WAS IN ADAM, SO WAS THE BRIDE in Christ. OH, COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. I DON'T CARE WHAT MISTAKES YOU'VE MADE. I DON'T CARE WHAT SIN THAT SATAN TRIES TO HOLD OVER YOU. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE [screaming] OF THROUGH ADAM, THE SECOND MAN, ADAM, JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WELL, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now, so Jesus had to be put to sleep. Adam had to be put to sleep &gt;&gt; in order to take the bride. &gt;&gt; And Jesus had to be taken put to sleep &gt;&gt; in order to pull the bride out of him. &gt;&gt; Pull the bride. You say, "No, no, no." Now, brother, he he put he put the flesh back together, &gt;&gt; brought him back out of his sleep. Hallelujah. Are you hearing me? And then ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT HAPPENED? THE VERY LIFE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; the feminist, the feminist side of God come down. Well, glory to God. You say, "Now, now it doesn't say that the feminist side of God come down." Listen, we've already got the groom. Now, here comes the Holy Spirit in his bride. The characteristics of the bride is not that of the groom. In in in other words, you're not the bride is not brash. The bride is not out trying to provide for herself. The bride is not out the the bride is meek. the the the the the the bride has been created, amen, to be a a companion suitable UNTO CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT A HELP ME IS. A COMPANION SUITABLE. Eve was a companion suitable unto unto uh uh uh Adam. AMEN. AND THE BRIDE IS A COMPANION. AMEN. HER DESIRE IS UNTO HER LORD. SHE COME FROM ADAM. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. CHRIST IS THE GROOM. CHRIST IS THE BURLY ONE. HE'S THE ONE THAT SAYS, "I'VE DONE PAID THE PRICE. I'VE PROVIDED EVERYTHING. [screaming] EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF. THE BRIDE IS THERE." AMEN. SITTING AT HIS TABLE, LOVING HIM, ADORING HIM, GIVING HIM HONOR AND PRAISE as only the bride can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; So though he was perfect, he was not complete until he gave birth or he expressed the attributes within him in their fullness. Hallelujah. He had to be delivered of the woman in order to be complete. Is that right? Amen. So is God all in all within him are those qualities. Brother Brandham says in very plain language, "The true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally, though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season. As each member came forth, it become expressed and took its place." I love that. I love that word expressed. HALLELUJAH. SO WHY HAVE YOU BEEN EXPRESSED? YOU'VE BEEN EXPRESSED TO DECLARE HIS DEITY, TO DECLARE HIS GLORY, NOT TO DECLARE YOUR NOT TO DECLARE YOUR WORTHLESSNESS, NOT TO DECLARE YOUR your you know UH UH YOUR SHAME AND NOT TO DECLARE those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. God knew you were born in your natural lineage. You were born in defeat. GOD KNEW IN YOUR BODY YOU WERE BROTHER JOHN. THERE'S NO GOOD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. As pretty as as as as as SISTER APRIL IS, THERE'S NO GOOD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON, GOD. &gt;&gt; AND AS HANDSOME AS THAT YOUNG FELLA RIGHT THERE BESIDE HER, THERE'S NO GOOD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. There's none of us. &gt;&gt; We fight depression. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We fight anxieties. &gt;&gt; We fight those things in our mind. And if you don't, if you're not careful, sometimes you can't separate the two. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you've got to &gt;&gt; you've got to you've got to separate the two. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because in your decreed season, you came forth. &gt;&gt; The new creation IS NOT YOU'RE STILL YOU'RE STILL LIVING IN YOUR BODY, but the new creation is that word made flesh in you. Well, praise the Lord. Now, he says each member come become expressed, took his place in the body. Thus, the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride. And though she is feminine designation, she is also called the body of Christ. It is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestined to him come from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body. Whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ. Well, can I hear a &gt;&gt; great big amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's because of this, BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, HER RIGHTEOUSNESS IS HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. HER ATTRIBUTES are his OWN GLORIOUS ATTRIBUTES. HER IDENTITY IS FOUND IN HIM. WHAT HE IS, SHE IS TO REFLECT. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAS, [screaming] SHE IS TO MANIFEST. And then he says, THERE IS NO FAULT. And I know sometimes you're looking at your wife and saying, "I just don't know." And sometimes you're looking at your husband and you're saying, "Ah." But when God when when your heavenly bridegroom looks at you, there is no fault in her. She is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending. She is the work OF HER LORD AND ALL HIS WORKS ARE PERFECT. CAN I HEAR A great big amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, IF MY WIFE COULD GET THAT from me every day that we live, if I COULD GET THAT KIND OF AFFIRMATION from her every day that I live, ain't going to happen because we're full of failures. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. AMEN. BUT I WILL TELL you the one that you came out of, Christ is saying, "You're all perfect." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? We've got to understand the Godhead. You've got to understand what God is doing. God in the great PILLAR OF FIRE. GOD IN THE PERFECT MAN. God in the redeemed body of the bride. &gt;&gt; And brother brother Brandon would put it this way. From beginning to the ending, she is the work of the Lord and all his works are perfect. In fact, in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "How can one fathom it? How can one understand it? Though we cannot do that, we can accept it by faith. For God has spoken it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SO THE SECOND MAN, ADAM, AMEN. He had the masculine and the feminine spirit. AMEN. HIS WIFE WAS IN HIM. HER EVERY ATTRIBUTE, EVERY ATTRIBUTE WAS IN him then. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why Adam could say bone of my bone. She's flesh of my flesh. Jesus would put it this way, and I love this. Now, catch this on the Godhead. Now, I quote this a lot, and you guys have heard it a lot these these last a little bit, but Colossians 2:9. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And we stopped there, but the 10th verse says, "And you are complete in him. You come from him. &gt;&gt; He was the EXPRESSION OF THE INVISIBLE. HE WAS THAT GREAT ABUNDANT, THAT GREAT GOD WHO WAS MOTHER, FATHER, MALE, FEMALE. HE COME [screaming] EMPTIED HIMSELF IN THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEN PULLED OUT OF CHRIST. that woman. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF PERFECTION. YOU WERE CREATED IN PERFECTION RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; The new birth is perfection. &gt;&gt; That's why God holds nothing against you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HIS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He is so He is so complete that the prophet of God Amen. The prophet of God tells us that that he is that that you are so complete in him, &gt;&gt; right? that you will not you will not come into the tribulation. They said, "Well, won't you have to be won't you have to go through the pur uh purification of the tribulation?" Brother Brandham SAYS THAT WOULD BE AGAINST EVERYTHING GOD. &gt;&gt; GOD TOOK CARE OF IT [screaming] ALL WHEN HE WENT TO CALVARY. &gt;&gt; AND SHE IS COMPLETE [screaming] IN HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. OH, GLORY TO GOD. LADIES, YOU'RE COMPLETE IN YOUR HUSBAND HERE ON THE EARTH. YOU HAVE A FAMILY. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING THEM IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD. BUT YOU THERE IS A GREATER PURPOSE. THERE'S A GREATER PURPOSE. YOU ARE THE VERY BRIDE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen? In this Christ dwells the fullness and you are now complete in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh the glorious union. Oh that glorious union. Bless the name of the Lord. Now Amen. Now the prophet would tell us that entire Bible is an expression. Hallelujah. Amen. He said God's great secrets he had before the world. back in the back part of God's mind. There was something he was trying and that he was going to achieve. He had a motive in doing it in order to let him be expressed. Amen. He wanted these attributes to be expressed. In him was love. In him was to be father. In him was to be son. In him was to be savior. In him was to BE HEALER. AND THESE ATTRIBUTES THAT WE see already expressed, they were in God. Amen. ON THAT HE SAYS, "AND THE ENTIRE BIBLE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE ONE GO." SOMEBODY SAY ONE GO, [screaming] ONE PURPOSE HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE IN THE ENTIRE BIBLE OUT OF ALL THE ACTS OF THE BELIEVERS IN THE Bible has been a type an EXPRESSION OF WHAT GOD'S GREAT GOAL IS. AND NOW in this last day, he's revealed it and SHOWED IT. THAT'S HIS PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT be able TO ACHIEVE TO HAVE HIS preeminence working in his church. and let the WORD OF GOD SHINE FORTH FIRST. No matter what any else looks like, I don't care if intellectuals say this, that, or the other. It h it has nothing to DO WITH IT. GOD'S WORD SAYS SO, and we are more than able to take it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, this glorious union, hallelujah. Now, it does require it does require submission just as it required submission from Mary. &gt;&gt; That's right. as it required submission. I believe God no matter what. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you're of a higher order than Mary. &gt;&gt; Mary wasn't the bride of God. &gt;&gt; Think about it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Mary Mary wasn't the bride of God. God created God. She was the human incubator. God created Amen. Uh uh the the the sperm and the egg. Amen. And here come Jesus Christ. She was not the bride. That's the reason why when brother Brandon would would would give the the types &gt;&gt; Hagar and and uh Sarah &gt;&gt; and and Mary &gt;&gt; and he would say Hagar was the first denominator or the you know coming out that was that was justification Luther and then here come here come Wesley he said that was Sarah and he says and now Mary though Mary says oh many say Mary she's she's it she said he She was the shuck. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Shuck. Mary said, "Be it unto me." Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, MARY WASN'T THE BRIDE of God, but you are. &gt;&gt; Mary had to go to the upper room to receive a new birth. &gt;&gt; Sure did. &gt;&gt; Sure did. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? Could you imagine that? After having the baby, raising Jesus. Amen. That was her boy. And yet she was up there in that upper room and had to receive the same new birth that everyone else had to receive. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO HERE YOU ARE TODAY. GOD'S NOT GOD'S NOT EVEN PUT YOU IN THERE WITH HAGAR. Thank God for that. He's not even put you in there with Sarah. Thank God for that. He didn't even put you in there. He didn't even put you in there with with with Mary. &gt;&gt; This is the greatest of all things where the word becomes flesh &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? GLORIOUS UNION. The glorious union. Amen. Where the word has a womb that it can pregnant. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Bride, groom producing promises supernatural. Yeah, that that's right. Brother Brandham says he wants to impregnate. Now, now when you receive the Holy Ghost, you that's not that's you're not giving birth. You're receiving the birth. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS IGNITED IN YOUR SOUL. YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. WHY ARE WE born again? SO THAT WE CAN BE IMPREGNATED BY GOD. AND HIS WORDS LIVE THROUGH us &gt;&gt; and become manifest through us. &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right here this morning? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I hope I hope I hope I hope this gets you. I hope this gets you right where it needs to get you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT THERE WHERE WHERE I HAVEN'T I can say, God, here I am. Amen. Would you receive the Holy Ghost? That's just the beginning. That's not the ending. That's not the ending of all things. YOU'RE JUST BORN AGAIN SO YOU CAN ACCEPT THE THINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; You're you're YOU YOU JUST BECOME BORN AGAIN SO THAT THE SEEDS OF GOD CAN COME INTO YOUR LIFE and live and manifest deity. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I SAID HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE CHOSEN THE SUN TO PREACH. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN THE MOON TO PREACH. HE COULD HAVE USED THE SOLAR SYSTEM. HE COULD HAVE USED THE ANIMAL LIFE. HE HE COULD HAVE HE COULD HAVE YOU DONE THE ANGELS. He could have done that, but he didn't. Amen. Why? Because the angels He wasn't carrying angels in his in his body. &gt;&gt; He wasn't carrying the sun and moon in his body. He created those things, but there was only one that he was carrying in his body. That's his bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen. When God used the when God used the type, he says he couldn't kill Sarah because she was part of Abraham. She was part of him. Amen. Though Sarah strug Well, praise the Lord. And then he says, "And God cannot KILL HIS BRIDE. HE CANNOT BRING JUDGMENT ON HIS BRIDE." AMEN. YOU HAVE TO &gt;&gt; FOR YOU [screaming] WERE INCLUDED IN THAT PROMISE. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why Amen. that that in the invisible UNION OF THE BRIDE. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, "AMEN, that you've got TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A WOMB. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A SACRED TRUST AND YOU JUST AS A A NATURAL WOMAN, AS YOU WOMEN HAVE GOT TO KEEP YOUR VIRTUES, you've got TO KEEP YOUR VIRTUES ONLY TO YOUR HUSBAND AND NOT COMMIT ADULTERY." HE SAID, "SO MUST THE bride &gt;&gt; keep her womb." &gt;&gt; Amen. unadulterated &gt;&gt; because God, &gt;&gt; he said, "What a sacred trust. What a sacred responsibility to a woman." Now, you see, she's a type of the church. Amen. You see why she's a type of the church, which is is the same responsibility. A woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood, her virtues, to her husband. The church has a sacred responsibility to prayer, to the word, to Christ, the same as the woman has. Amen. On doubt he says she's a type. SHE HAS THE SAME PRECIOUS VERSE USED by the spirit given TO HER TO PRESERVE THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD. Somebody say to preserve &gt;&gt; the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything of the world or anything. Stay virgin to the word as a woman IS TO STAY VIRTUOUS TO HER HUSBAND. IT'S A SACRED TRUST TO honor her Lord's word above every man-made creed, wisdom, denomination there is. The church has been given that creed. Can you say amen? Amen. The spoken word's original seed. He would say Christ has TAKEN HIMSELF THAT BRIDE TO BE PREGNANT WITH HIS OWN SEED WORD IN HER [screaming] WOMB IN her mind. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. M now I want to deal with this a minute. Now he's he's pulled you out. He's justified you, sanctified you, given you that. Now he's created himself this bride and only through you is the supernatural going to be expressed. That's the reason why we don't believe doctor's reports over God's reports. That's the reason why we don't believe what we see in our family. If someone's going astray, we we count that not. We look not at the deadness of Sarah's womb. We look at God's word. &gt;&gt; We're not going to look at anything else. That's the reason why, Amen. When we when we're when we're going through our our valleys and it SEEMS LIKE GOD IS SO FAR AWAY FROM us and it seems LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SO DRY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONSIDER THE DEADNESS OF OUR WOMB. WE ARE CONSECRATED TO GOD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WE'RE KEEPING THAT MIND PURE. FOR KEEPING THAT BECAUSE I [screaming] AM HIS BRIDE &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO IMPREGNATE ME WITH THE ORIGINAL SEED WHICH IS HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER HAD A woman that he could impregnate himself with. Eve committed adultery and brought us all down. &gt;&gt; Adam was to speak he was to speak the creative word of God. He was in the image of God. &gt;&gt; She was the womb. She children were to come forth through the womb of of of Eve without without sorrow. &gt;&gt; He was to speak and it was to happen. Well, praise the Lord. Now, here we are today. We're still in our We're still in this this fallen flesh, but God's got a creation on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; There's a soul that is made in his image. You are the feminist side of God. God speaks his word. It comes INTO YOUR MIND, DROPS DOWN INTO YOUR SOUL, AND THINGS TAKE PLACE. GOD'S WORD IS A SEED. GOD'S WORD MUST LIVE. GOD'S WORD CAN ONLY BE EXPRESSED THROUGH HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense here this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A [screaming] VIRGIN IS CARRYING CHILD TODAY. THE [screaming] VIRGIN WOMAN, A VIRGIN MARY IS CARRYING THE PROMISES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; In you, you are carrying the promise of a rapture. &gt;&gt; And all you can say is, "I don't know how this is going to happen, &gt;&gt; but here I am. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? WE LOOK WE SAY [laughter] I DON'T HALLELUJAH. But there there's a pull on the inside. There's something on me as as as as as brother Brennham was talking about Mary when God put those holy thoughts in the in the heart of Mary and begin to have her think and prepare IN HER HEART PREPARING HER WOMB. Brother Brandham said God knew who the woman would be. THE VERY DAY THAT ISAIAH SAID, "A VIRGIN shall conceive," God knew her name was Mary. God knew when she was going to have that child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then God be to prepare the womb. Womb womb. Womb. God be to prepare this. [snorts] Her thoughts become holy. Her thoughts begin to God begin to I wonder who that virgin would be. I wonder as the as the kids enacted the other day, [sighs] I what was it? It was holy desires calling her, preparing her because God was fixing to do something supernatural in her. &gt;&gt; What has God [laughter] What has God been doing in this last day? Send a prophet our way which is a lot higher than the angels. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A prophet's word is a lot higher than the angel's words. &gt;&gt; A prophet comes and what's he doing? Preparing our hearts. Preparing our hearts. There's seed that must come forth there that there's something that has to happen. Get ready. YOU'RE HIS BRIDE. HE'S PREPARING YOU. ARE YOU HEARING ME? AND THE WORD. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE'RE SEPARATING FROM ALL UNBELIEF. We are not going to commit adultery against the word. We're standing there. AMEN. WE CAME FROM [screaming] GOD. OUR DESIRES ARE HIS. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now Christ is taking himself a bride to pregnant with his own seed word in her womb, the spirit womb in her mind. Don't mix it with denominational trash. She's a virgin to him." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham would say in another place, Mary, the mother of Jesus in the city of Nazareth, the meanest city uh that there was in the land, but out there uh God chose a little lady to give birth to a son, an incubator, a womb. Amen. A baby had to be born by and he took such a person to do it. AND GOD WORKS THROUGH HUMAN beings to redeem human beings. He can take you and work through you to redeem humanity. you if you'll completely dedicate everything you are. If you're a young woman, dedicate your morals. You're a young man, DEDICATE YOUR MORALS. DEDICATE YOUR MIND. DEDICATE YOUR THINKING. DEDICATE YOUR HEART. DEDICATE YOUR SOUL. DEDICATE ALL you are. And let Christ work through that. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "BE IT UNTO me &gt;&gt; according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] DON'T YOU SEE IT? AREN'T YOU WANTING TO SHOUT HALLELUJAH RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WELL, [applause] he said, "Yeah, but you sort of prompted that one." AMEN. HALLELUJAH. THERE'S SOMETHING IN IN IN it in in the Eve that's looking back at her Adam and saying, "Oh, I came from you. I'm complete in you." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, it should be that way today &gt;&gt; with you wives to your husbands. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just look at him with those. Every time you look at him, your eyes just start going every which direction. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Michael amens it. You know it's the truth. Amen. That's right. But the first man, Adam, and we understand that his wife did not keep her womb. You say, "Now, now, Brother Window, you're you're mixing the natural with the spirit." Brother Brandham says she fell a long time before she committed adultery. &gt;&gt; Okay. The sin nature came in then, &gt;&gt; not after the act. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She gave birth to a thought that was contrary to his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's not give birth. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, everyone has a mind, but you're the only one of the new creation." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; His word can't pregnantate those guys out there. It'll neverate a rapture. It'll never A prophet's word could only come to those who God has predestinated &gt;&gt; and that seed drops into your heart. Now, it don't matter. It don't matter. Most most promises of God are so out there that you can't do anything about it. You You couldn't make it happen in the first place. And that's the reason why we ain't trying to work up. We ain't trying to make jump and shout, dance. We ain't trying to do none of that. And though I believe in it all, I love dancing. I love shouting. I love crying. I love it all. But listen, I'm not doing that to try to bring God's presence down. I am not. I am here saying, GOD, YOU STARTED THE work and you're going to complete THE WORK. YOU'VE GIVEN ME A PROMISE. AND MY JOB, MY ONLY JOB, SOMEBODY SAY, MY ONLY JOB IS TO BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY ONLY JOB IS TO LOVE HIM. [screaming] HONOR HIS WORD. HONOR HIS COMMITMENT TO ME AND SAY, "I BELIEVE YOU." &gt;&gt; GLORY TO THE LAMB OF GOD AND HIS SEED WILL COME TO PASS IN your life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he's taking the natural and the spiritual. Now, he would say that c can I have just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "You'll notice how that Eve was united with Adam. She become part of him." Did you notice she he created man male and female he created he them both male and female? Man was both male and female when it come to being in the uh spirit of feminist and masculine. Then God took from the from his side. Did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit. The body part of the woman was a was a byproduct. After the creation had been finished, God had taken the side of the atom of Adam, a ri. But not the spirit. The spirit was the part of Adam. For he was both man and woman spiritually speaking, masculine and feminine. Now, do you see the great picture? WE IN FLESH ARE DIFFERENT. WE'RE LIKE A byproduct created by holy wedlock in the natural. BUT IN THE SPIRIT WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, NOT some other spirit, the spirit of the living God. We are in his likeness, in his unity, in his perfect image of the living God, which makes uh because we become sons and daughters, not separated, the same spirit, same God, same person. We've been joined in wedlock to the eternal. You see how God planned it that we should be not different, but we should be him. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love it? He says on the day of Pentecost is let's see here not some other being of some other tribe but a real union the offspring of the almighty God by a holy union. Amen. Now the body comes from a mother and a father but the spirit come from God and God separated himself as Adam was separated. And on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire SEPARATING ITSELF SETTING UPON each member of that church. God putting himself together. I just love that. God putting himself together. &gt;&gt; God putting himself together. Bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God creating a bride. Members of the bride. AMEN. GOD PUTTING HIMSELF TOGETHER. Then with that group of people together, what does it do? IT BRINGS BACK the unified body of the Lord Jesus. TODAY IN THIS GREAT SEPARATION THAT WE'RE LIVING IN DENOMINATIONAL differences and things and what a pity and what a disgrace, but we're joined in heavenly wedlock to the eternal God. &gt;&gt; Someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. HE'S GOT A BRIDE THAT HE WANTS TO HAVE PREEMINENCE in that's going to take his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, these are the the these are two crazy uh uh uh Christmas messages, but I I I just wanted to this this is what Christmas should mean to us &gt;&gt; is let his word be born in me. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Let his word be born in me. See, in Pentecost, we we we we we received the I I I believe I received the Holy Ghost. I just I just believe that the Holy Ghost within me led me to this message. Yes, &gt;&gt; I just do. &gt;&gt; But all my jumping and shouting and even all all of those manifestations, are you even healings and miracles? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Just something was missing. &gt;&gt; But when that message came, it anchored me. &gt;&gt; I came from him. &gt;&gt; That's where I came from. I didn't come from the shouting. &gt;&gt; Shouting's part of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouts. &gt;&gt; I didn't come from the miracles. Miracles part of it. Sons of God performs miracles. I came from the word. [applause] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word WAS MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? HALLELUJAH. DON'T YOU JUST LOVE HIM? &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? See this here? HERE HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN [screaming] GOD COME TO THE BREAD WOULD SAY, "AMEN. WE WE'VE BEEN, you know, been been hitting along the Who is this? Melzdc." But but we we we we've been looking at the when WE LOOKED THERE AT THE uh uh here here come this this great eternal one. Amen. It was and he just had his the attributes the thoughts of God. They were the eternal thoughts of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And then he come into the word form. Amen. Jesus took on that that theophony of the word that word form and then he become flesh. Well, brother Brandham says now that was Christ. He said there was the the attributes the thoughts then he become the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The logos he could he could he could appear to Abraham. He can and then he then he come in the body of Jesus Christ. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He says now we were his thoughts at the beginning. We were there, but we skipped the WORD PART, THE THEOPHONY PART, THE ONE THAT knows that can. We just come to flesh to be tempted and tested to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now we're going back to the word. &gt;&gt; We were thoughts, &gt;&gt; flesh, and now we're going to the word. Jesus was thoughts, word, flesh. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? THAT'S WHY IN THE LAST DAY, GOD HAD TO SEND US A PROPHET WITH THE WORD BECAUSE THERE'S A BRIDE WHO CAN BE IMPREGNATED WITH THAT WORD. AND SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE THE WORD. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE A BODY CHANGE. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE THE MILLENNIUM. SHE'S GOING TO PRODUCE AMEN. BRAND NEW BODIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're pregnant. &gt;&gt; All right. If the musicians would come, Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; A LAVISH LOVE AFFAIR IS WHAT THIS IS. &gt;&gt; It's a love affair. &gt;&gt; Well, why would he call you his bride if it wasn't a lavish one? Come on. Hallelujah. If I can't if I can't enjoy my wife, there's times I don't. But there but and there's times she don't. But I'm telling you, our love together, we we we love one another. and and and if I had to go through life mad at her or her going through life mad, man, it would just be rough. She's my best friend. I love her. I mean, I love her. You love me. Amen. All right. Good. And baby, when I kiss, I I I I kiss with intent. That ain't little They ain't little pecs. I I love my wife. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Why can't we have that kind of a love relationship with God? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I come for I love him. I I I I love him with all of my heart. I love him. Is that right? Brother Brandon would say this is God's mystery of love expressed. Are you Am I making sense as far as the Godhead? This is not This is God. This is the only God who had masculine and feminism. Vivish, he expressed it through the man Jesus Christ. When he placed it all in him, then out of that Christ has come the bride. I believe miracles are in the making. You know why? Because a bride is not going to see herself as a The bride's going to see herself as the only lover of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; going to see himself. He can impregnate you with a word right now. You can give [music] birth. Let him do it. The prophet said the bride can't the the bride can't do nothing without him. &gt;&gt; He's the life. She's the womb. Well, do you love him? &gt;&gt; All right. I I hope I I hope this is okay here. I can say I want to have a child. I'm going to have a child, but I can't have a child. My wife [music] could say, "I'm going to have a baby." H I'm going to have a baby. She ain't doing it without me. &gt;&gt; But together, GOD HAS ALL [screaming] OF THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; He's looking for He's looking for a [music] heart &gt;&gt; that'll open it up and say, "Here I am. &gt;&gt; Here I am. &gt;&gt; Drop your life in my mind. Drop your life down into my heart." Are Are y'all saying it takes It takes mother and father. It can't be mama by herself. Can't be daddy by himself. It takes a holy union. And God has so designed this that he CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF. HE CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF [music] without his lady. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise [laughter] the Lord. So, you know what? YOU YOU KNOW WHAT MY JOB IS? MY JOB IS TO LOVE HIM, to honor him, to give him Hallelujah. Just like Just like you do to your husbands. You You honor him and you love him and you respect him. YOU YOU YOU RESPECT HIS WORD. AMEN. THAT MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, BUT YOU BUT YOU BUT YOU YOU'RE TRUSTING him as your leader. [music] &gt;&gt; And he can only he can only be a man as you give him that right. He can only feel like a man as you give him that right. It requires you. &gt;&gt; But when we come in and say, "Here I am, Lord. I [music] know you've got this." And then you go acting like you know he's got it. And you confessing like he's got it. And you're believing like he's [music] got it. God looks down to you. Jesus Jesus looks at you and go hey that's my girl. Is that right? [music] H that's my that's my baby. That right? You see he says it's [music] the mystery of great love expressed &gt;&gt; the husband and the wife. &gt;&gt; Well glory Merry Christmas. Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we playing [music] there, Brother Kobe? That your word be born in the manger. Let it live [music] in me. Let it scar. Live inside this [music] house of clay and mold me every day. Let your word be born in the manger. It was a tiny simple stable [music] all beaten and worn. so unlikely a [singing and music] place for his word to be born. He didn't choose [music and singing] some place special to reveal his majesty. Give him control. He'll be born. Let your word In the manger [music and singing] of &gt;&gt; let it live. &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing and music] live inside this house [music] of clay and mold me every day. Let your word be born in the manger. [music] Oh, [singing] outwardly I'm nothing, not much to behold. So unlikely [singing] the place for your word to unfold. But if I [music] &gt;&gt; and let him &gt;&gt; let him [singing] have his way. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. &gt;&gt; Glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; He'll change me. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, let your word. &gt;&gt; Let it be born. &gt;&gt; Live in me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it [singing and music] live. Give me Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it start. &gt;&gt; Move inside. [music] &gt;&gt; Express yourself to me and through me, Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; Let your word [music] be born in the manger.

Hallelujah. Oh, to magnify. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Holy. [music and singing] Now, now listen. I know. I know. I know this morning is is, you know, it's simple and and my my my thoughts are is this right here. the connection the connection of this this virgin [music] birth where the we're virgin to nothing but his word and I want you to take that home because sometimes when you're in prayer you're feeling just you know Satan fights us all in prayer. He fights us all in prayer. He really he really does it. And again the prophet of God says if he can't destroy the word [music] he will try to destroy the vessel in which the word dwells. &gt;&gt; So he can't destroy the word. &gt;&gt; So he [music] he works on you. And if he can get that element of unbelief. So, so what we've got to do is we've got we Listen, I don't care what it is. Leave out this building here this morning. Leave out this building. And I don't care. I I don't care if we're needing if we're [music] needing a new liver or if we're needing healed from cancer or if we're needing healed from whatever it is. If God drops those desires in our hearts, and it's strange [music] how God does it, but he does. He he he'll drop that little something down and and [music] begins to move. He and it's that way even in prayer when when the Lord is is is wanting to call you into a deeper prayer. All of a sudden, you wake up one morning and there's this little [music] something here that's I really I'm needing to talk to the Lord. He's dropping that in your in your heart cuz he's usually wanting to impregnate that heart with something. And so those those times alone with him [music] is important. Amen. Because we never know when that exact time's going to come when his Holy [music] Spirit just comes down in our heart. Something you've been believing for for a long time. They've been waiting. They had been waiting for 800 years for the Messiah to be born. But something started stirring strangely in Mary. Something strange. Is [music] there something stirring strangely in you lately? Is something stirring you? Is something even even for the rapture? Is there something [music] beginning to really stir you? It's it's that's the way God works. He's calling [music] us closer in the little areas of our lives. That's that's his word. That's he he's he's wanting [music] you to prepare the bedding grounds, as the prophet of God would say, prepare the ground for the seed to drop in. When using Mary, he said, "Now, see, Mary wasn't running around flirting with [music] the boys and doing all of this. Mary, there was something about Mary. she had, bought it, prepared her heart to receive that word. I I just I just can't help but believe [music] that we're a people of prepared hearts. Some someone told me, "Well, we don't we don't need to see the miracles." Yes, we do need to see the miracles. We're created to manifest miracles. &gt;&gt; We're we're we're his bride. We're his body. We need to see miracles and God needs to perform the miracles. He needs you to do it. &gt;&gt; You're already a miracle. The very the very fact that you're here in Lelay Osa and have a desire to please him and to serve him. Are you hearing me? [music] You come from him. That's a miracle itself. Glory. Glory to God. Brother Bradom says Jesus done okay until [music] they accepted Jesus. You know they Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But when he stood up and said I and my father are one from that day on they quit walking [music] with him. And I believe God's wanting to hear you say that. I [singing] and my groom. I and my Christ are one. He is free to use me. He's free to speak through me. Drop that seed. Drop that word. I've I've carried enough bitterness. I've carried enough this. Carried enough that. I I don't I don't want that in my womb. I want I want nothing but righteousness. I want his word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the famous lines [music] here. Amen. That that that every one of the messages uses it says they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head. Headship of Christ was his. Notice the harmony. Jesus never did anything until he seen the father. The father first showed him first harmony between God and Christ. So will the bride. He shows her his word of life. He shows her and she receives it and she never doubts it. Nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it again. Then I got a great big hallelujah. Here's the secret. The word is IN THE BRIDE AND THE MIND OF CHRIST TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. She does it in his name. She has thus sayeth the Lord. Then it is grammatized by the Holy Spirit. So the Holy Spirit waters till it's grown and serves his purpose. [music] They do only his will. And he says, "Amen, I'll believe that." No one can persuade them different. THEY HAVE THUS SAYAITH THE LORD or they keep still. Then they will do the works of God, FOR IT IS HIMSELF in them, continuing his word to fulfill as he did completing his day all things when he was here. He did not complete all when he was here, for it was not yet [music] time. It will now be accomplished through his [music] bride. All as I lift my hands and worship [music] and to magnify [singing] his name flow through me. Holy Spirit flow. Oh, let's sing it again. But we're SINGING IT WITH REVELATION NOW. All flow through [music] me. God bless you. [music] Thank you for your patience with me this morning. Flow through me. [singing] Flow through me. Holy Spirit flow through me [singing and music] as I lift my hands to worship and [singing] to magnify. Hallelujah. Flow through me. [singing] Holy Spirit, flow through me. God bless you. Aren't you glad that [music] you belong to one another? That we're all a great body. And it's always so [music] good to have brother Steve and sister Emily with us.

I didn't really want to say that because I might not get breakfast for the rest of the year. [laughter] And uh so so we us guys [music] like to crow a lot when it comes to our breakfast abilities.

[music] So, we had we we were we instead of instead of making the dough up, Brother Joe says, [music] "Listen, let's just go let's just go get our biscuits and and then we'll put them in there and we'll have this all done." Well, somehow or another, when those biscuits, they were left out or something [music] and they were just one big doughy mess. Amen. and and we were trying to cook breakfast that morning and I could see all the ladies [music] smiling as if the Lord either answered their prayer or they had helped the Lord answer their prayer. But uh anyways, so so we're looking we're we're looking forward to that. Uh it's going to be a wonderful time. So everyone else will be back into town by then and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um uh so that that'll be that'll be excellent.
