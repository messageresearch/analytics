you and we just commit the remainder of the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray [Music] amen all right let's go ahead and turn to Revelations chapter 2 [Music] Revelations chapter 2 and we'll be starting at verse one unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write the these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them liars and H has borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake H has labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God you may all have your seats when brother Wendell asked me if I would be willing to take the service tonight he asked if I would feel uh comfortable kind of continuing in the the church age book um and I told him I was willing to try so we'll see what happens um it's the I will be the first one to say I am not brother Wendell and so if wants to come in and clean up after me I am perfectly okay with that but we'll trust that the Lord will will guide us as we continue through it so starting in page 92 um of the the church age book we're still in the Ephesians Church age um we're beginning into the the section that's labeled the seed of of Nic atenism um and brother brandom starts out uh with reminding us or with defining what what is the nicians which I know brother Wendell covered previously but um in the church age book uh here on on page 92 it says what are these nicians the word comes from two Greek words niiko which means to conquer and Leos which means the Ley in plain fact somebody was doing something in that early church which was Conquering the leoty if the leoty were being conquered then it must have been some Authority there that was doing it and we'll drop down just to the to the next paragraph and it says now to get to the real meaning of what we are about to go into I must caution you to to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are opposite are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are are made of those two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the Ephesian church is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad two Vines make the church they are like the wheat and the tears growing up side by side but one is the true the other is the false now God will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived Matthew chapter 24 and: 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so way back there in the early Church of very short period after Pentecost the false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we find these Deeds of the nicians and that spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine until it is destroyed by God now have you got it all right now what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost in plain English that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit and the control of the spirit this was exactly what took place after Moses LED Israel out of Egypt the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire prophetic utterance Miracles and signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God selected and God ordained and God equipped and God sent men men with the whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move they rebelled and wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by then they wanted a king then they wanted to be exactly like the world and went into complete apostasy and Oblivion that is exactly how the first church age started and it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you now I want to say that I believe in leadership but is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and we'll start at verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature and of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they L lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so brother brandom as he's laying this out in the Ephesians Church age he's talking about how the Ephesian Church age began to move away from the god selected God ordained God equipped God sent men and began to move towards having men that would be ruling over them that would be taking authority over them where it wasn't supposed to be now brother brandom isn't telling us that we're supposed to go away from having men that are speaking or ministering he says very clearly that he believes in God sent men to the church he believes in holy a holy spirit-led Ministry he still ties it back and still says that I believe in the scripture where it says I send some Apostles I I send some prophets I send some evangelists pastors teachers he's not saying that we're supposed to get away from a Ministry but he's saying there's a difference between a spirit-led Ministry and a ministry that's simply there because they want the power and they want the authority and they want to be the ones that are ruling over and taking charge they don't he's not wanting it to be a Ministry that is there for political reasons a Ministry that is there because they enjoy being in a leadership position they enjoy taking charge they enjoy doing these different things now there's some called ministers that are good at leadership and that's one of the skills God give them there are others that are in Ministry that are not good at leadership right because God didn't put that on them that's right and that's fine what matters is the part that they are God called they are God sent they are God anointed and empowered to deliver the message amen they are the ones that are supposed to come to speak to the people that they are in front of to speak to the congregation that they're before what I'm ministering here is not necessarily what brother Wendell is ministering as he's at brother Isaiah Brooks church maybe he's talking on the church ages maybe he's not but he's ministering to a different congregation and so his call that God has placed on his life is to minister to the people that are there and the Holy Spirit anointing him can then use him to minister to the needs that are in that congregation amen we've seen that even as brother Wendell was beginning to go through the church ages when we would have some of these visiting ministers that have come through that they start hitting on things that brother Wendell was just covering in the church ages and it's not because brother Wendell told him hey preaching on the church ages it's because it's the Holy Spirit going this is what I'm ministering to this congregation this is what I'm ministering to the people that are sitting here this isn't necessarily what needs to be spoken to the church that's over in Tennessee at this moment this isn't necessarily what needs to be spoken to the church at Louisiana at this moment right I'm not saying they should never read the church age book but the ministry is designed to speak to the people in that congregation where they're at in that moment in that place that's one of the reasons that we don't go for the idea of someone telling us hey every church should be listening to this message right now because not every church is in the exact same situation the exact same issues or problems so they don't need to listen to the exact same message at the exact same time God has sent a Ministry and anointed a Ministry to speak to the people that are there that's what God sends and this Spirit of niotis is pulling the other direction to go no man should be deciding and we can instruct everyone at once we can say every church should be preaching on this subject on this day because that's what we've decided should be the topic for this year and then here's what you should preach in May here's what you should preach in June here's what you should preach in July it doesn't matter what your people are facing it doesn't matter what struggles they're going through what matters are we've mapped out for the Year this is what we're ministering and that wasn't the way God intended it God intended to have a Ministry a Shepherd that cared about his flock he cared about whether this sheep had been injured this sheep had been hurt whether this sheep was getting enough nutrition he didn't need to have just a generic message he needed to have something that was tailored to what his flock was facing and he needed to be able to minister to them right continuing on page 93 of the Ephesian Church age right at the very bottom of the page paragraph says but see what was happening back there that false Vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took Authority and vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old aonic system they became Antichrist for they disposed of his medeor mediatorship and imposed their own God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate it too we would have to be Stone BL blind not to see the same thing at work All Through the Ages and right now it is the worst of all what it was was organization that separated the people of God God's people are supposed to be one by one Spirit are they all baptized into one body and everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control and Bishops became archbishops and with imposing titles they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days of after Pentecost these Deeds were the beginning of apostolic succession from Apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to church membership as the means of Saving Grace the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist Christ by his Spirit was predominating the church now we're going to jump around just a little bit so we're actually going to turn forward in our church age book to page 197 because as we're looking at the nickan spirit this is talked about in multiple Church ages so we're actually jumping into the pergan church age just for a little bit here page 197 it's under the heading of the doctrine of the nicians you will recall that I brought out in the Ephesian age that the word nicotin comes from two Greek words Niko which means to conquer and Leo which means the Ley nikotin means to conquer the Ley now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which movs with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word- living men who lead the people through feeding them the word amen he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where priests or ministers are such mediate between God and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together nickan ISM destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants now this Doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age it appears that the problem lay in two words elders prors and overseers Bishops though scripture shows that there are several Elders in each Church some began ignatious among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man the Elder is the man Bishop is the office of the man Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord then we're going to drop down to the next pair paragraph in the Blue Book it'll be at the bottom of page 198 in order to clarify this even more Let Me Explain Nicko ISM in this way you recall that in Revelations 13:3 it says and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast now we know the wounded head was the Pagan Roman Empire that great political world power this head Rose again as the Roman Catholic spiritual Empire now watch this carefully what did political Pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered that was the seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth tore and devoured whom she tore and devoured could not rise again as when she destroyed Carthage and SED her to salt the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same defied and Conquer that is nickan ISM and God hates it and then we're going to do one more jump here and we're going to jump forward to page 369 we're going to the very back of the book into a resume of the ages I'm sorry we're actually starting at the very bottom of page 369 the third age revealed by the spirit of Prophecy that the worldly Church would adopt nianis as a Doctrine the separation of the clergy from the Ley Grew From the biblical truth of the elders Shepherds of local flocks ruling the flocks by the word to the Deeds of nicians wherein the clergy set themselves in rank one over the other which unscriptural formula then evolved into a priesthood that placed the clergy between man and God giving the clergy certain rights all the while denying the Ley their god-given rights this was usurpation in this age it became a Doctrine it was established in the church as the assured word of God which indeed it was not but the clergy called it the word of God and therefore the doctrine was Antichrist now we're going to flip back into the Ephesian Church age and we're going to go to page 105 Ephesian Church age page 105 now let this be known about halfway down the page a little over halfway now let this be known scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see it is there for a purpose 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works every word is given for a reason every word is given for a purpose it's not there just to play it's not there just to toy with it's not there because it sounds good it's given for a purpose and every and all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for proof for correction for instruction in righteousness amen so we can't move away from the word the word is where it all comes from nickan ISM pulls you away from the word to instead have a Ministry that is set aside that is set above you as this is who I Look to this is who I Look to for everything there's no need for me to be in the word myself because the ministry will tell me what I need to know the ministry will lay L it all out the ministry will make everything clear to me I don't have to look for my own Revelation I just have to look for what the ministry is going to tell me I don't have to go and study the scriptures myself because the ministry is going to say hey we're going to be spending the next month going through the book of whatever or we're going to take a n week study on the book of whatever take your pick we're going to take a two month study on the book of habach I I have guys that I work with that will talk about how the minister has been on this book of the Bible for this many weeks months whatever because they're doing a deep study in it and I sit there and go that's not a bad thing but surely somebody needed something other than that book within two to three months it's like a one to two week study great three months or two months on the single thing and you're not telling me anybody needed something beyond that outside of that you didn't need to deviate for this Sunday because God really pulled you this direction to minister to this need come on there's something off here the spirit of nicim pulls it to where there's a Ministry that is set up and everything I need comes from the ministry I'm no longer looking at Christ as my resource I'm no longer looking at him for my strength or him for my Revelation I'm looking to the man that's standing behind the pulpit or the man that's up on stage that's everything that I need even when you're not even when you're outside the Catholic system and you're not saying oh no they're not actually a mediator between me and you know I still believe Christ is my mediator but they're still looking at that Minister as a mediator whether they call him that or not that's what they're looking to him for that's what they're placing him as as he's the one who can get a hold of God he's the one who can reach out to it and how easy is it even for us in the message ranks to start to go these are some of my these are my favorite ministers man they can really get a hold of the Lord I I really feel most comfortable to go up for prayer if this brother's here come on I really feel most comfortable to go up with my need and ask them to pray for for me or ask them to anoint me with oil because I know God hears their prayer come on okay well do you believe the minister that's preaching that you don't like as much is still Spirit-filled is still God called God anointed then God hears his prayer just as much as your favorite preacher maybe he doesn't have the record behind him of all well-known Miracles that you're holding on to but then we remember wait are the Miracles because of the man or the Miracles because of God come now there are ministers that have a Ministry of healing have a Ministry of Breaking Chains all these different things absolutely I don't argue that in the slightest I'll be the first one to say I enjoy when brother Daryl's here yes sir I enjoy enjoy his ministry and I enjoy the sincerity he has behind his prayer yeah he doesn't have any when he goes to pray for someone you can tell he doesn't have a doubt that God can answer the prayer am but does that mean that some other no-name brother that I've never heard of isn't able to pray for me am I starting to fall into that same place where I'm starting to put more stock in the man than I am God that inspires him that leads him you know if I'm here and the spirit's moving and I'm feeling that pull or that tug that I should go up for prayer and I resist because well you know brother Daryl is going to be here next week I'll just have him I'll go up for prayer when brother Daryl's here or I'll go up when this minister or that Minister even if you're waiting going man I I'm going to wait cuz I want brother Wendell to pray for me if the spirit's moving and pushing you are you really going to argue come or are we allowing that Spirit of nianis that puts man above God to begin to pray on us yeah we all know the story brother brandom talked about of the sister that was out in the audience and she kept feeling a burden to go pray for this baby and finally she she gave into the pressure she went and asked the the mother if she could pray and the mother didn't go oh well brother brandom's going to pray or you know I'm goingon to i'mna I'm going to get in the prayer line she was like oh absolutely honey you can go ahead and pray and I may not be quoting it for but we all know the story and she prays for the baby then she goes up and she's sitting up in the balcony yeah and the mother and the baby get to come through the line and they come up to brother brandom the prophet of the age yeah come on and brother brandom looks at the baby and then begins to tell like oh no this Baby's already healed because because there was this sister it wasn't the favorite Minister come on it wasn't our Prophet come on it was a little sister that felt led by the spirit to go pray amen if God if brother brandom can share that kind of story he's going he's doing his very best to make it clear don't Elevate me don't Elevate the man it's the spirit and if the spirit's leading some no-name Minister that's up here or if the spirit's leading your brother or your sister that's beside you how are you going to sit there and go well I want to wait until this Minister's here or I want to wait until that Minister because that's who I'm comfortable with maybe God's trying to call us out of our comfort zone for a reason or maybe he's just trying trying to remind us that he's Sovereign and that he's the one that does the work that he's the one that will minister to the need that he's the one that performs the healing performs The Miracle yes we love these brothers we love brother Ron Spencer and brother Daryl and brother Donnie and brother Tim and brother pick your pick your name and we love the powerful Ministry that God has Behind these men but if we can believe that the man that's up here is spirit-led and spirit anointed and spirit called then God will respond to that prayer as much as any of the big name ministers that we may have that's right that's but it's so easy for us to fall into that and that is the spirit of nicka to ISM to start putting a man above God going that's who I'm going to respond to that's who I'm going to look towards that's where I'm going to get my Miracle God calls us to look to him for it and to look to his word the word doesn't change whether it's whether it's brother Wendell up here saying by your stripes I'm Healed whether it's me up here saying by your stripes I'm Healed or whether it's some other brother it doesn't change the word it doesn't change the god that said it and the god that will make it come to pass going forward to page to page 106 right towards the the bottom of the page we're going to start just a little bit into this paragraph he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of God death was anything that wasn't the word of God she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her God could have said don't pick more fruit off the trees than you can eat Satan could say look that is quite right you see if you pick too much it will rot but here is a method of preserving the fruit and yet at the same time you can pick all you want so you see you can have your way and God's way all at the same time the devil would have her right there he that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the whole law don't fool with that word that is exactly what happened in the Ephesian age before it ran out in about 170 ad and what did that tree produce the tree of knowledge produced death Cain killed his brother Abel the wicked killed the righteous it set a pattern it will keep that pattern until the restoration of all things as spoken by the prophets the tree of knowledge produce clever men men of renown but their ways are the ways of death God's people are simple but spiritual minded leaning toward God and nature calmly tilling the soil caring for truth rather than wealth the seed of the serpent has brought tremendous Commerce wonderful inventions but with it all comes death their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in war and in peace time their mechanical inventions such as the car kill even more in a time of Peace than do the invention of War destroy in times of trouble death and destruction are the fruit fruits of her labors but they are religious they believe in God they are like their father the devil and their ancestor Cain both of them believed in God they go to church they mingle with the righteous as do tears mingle with the wheat in so doing they corrupt and produce a nickan religion they spread their poison in every effort to destroy the seed of God even as Cain killed Apel there is no fear of God before their eyes but God loses none of his own he keeps them even in death and has promised that in the last day he will raise them up we're called to be different God calls us to to live by every word eve missed one word but God has called a bride that will hold on to the word and won't miss anything but hold on to every dot every tit let's turn forward to page 150 if we're going to be in the saman church age for just a moment page 115 we're about 2/3 2/3 of the way down the page second to the last paragraph on on page 150 down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thought of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that then we're going to turn forward to page 152 and we're going to start on the second line of the page these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member come forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in design destion she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in a one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manif manest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were're reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken 2 Corinthians CH 5 and starting at verse 16 says wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto to them and hath committed unto us the world the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him we're called to be different God calls us to live by every word when the world wants to go into this Spirit of nianis that allows them to follow what a man says instead of having to abide by the word and spend their time in the word to know what it says to know what God's telling them to do it's they can sit back and simply listen to what this Minister says they need to do or how they need to live or what they need to do but God's calling out a special people that are going to be ambassadors for him that are going to uh live in a way and show themselves in a way that is different that is going to let them be set apart you know when you have an ambassador and Ambassador has to be selected out of the people it's not just any random Joo that they pick to to send off it's somebody that has certain qualifications that can carry themselves in a certain manner that is going to be held to a certain standard you know they don't want the ambassador to go off and then completely assimilate with the country they were sent to they're supposed to still be representing who they came from and so when Christ says that we are ambassadors we are there to represent a different Kingdom we are there to represent and live in a way that's different we're not falling into the Trap of well we can just blend in with everybody else and we're good it's we are supposed to be set apart we're supposed to be living by the word that God gave us and if you live by that word you can't help but be noticed that's right right whether it's our sisters in the way that they dress whether it's the brothers and the way that they act on the job site when they don't get as upset or as frust frustated when they don't start cursing about every little thing when they don't do this or do that people look and go there's something different they may not necessarily be able to place their finger on it they may not necessarily be able to identify it completely but they're able to look and go this is not like everybody else this does not blend in this stands out there's something different and people may not know in that moment wow that's an ambassador of Christ right there but yet at the same time they're able to recognize there's something different because you're living by the word you're living by the instruction manual that you've been given to go this is how you carry yourself this is how you handle different situations how in the world can they be so calm and have so much peace when this is going wrong and that is going wrong and they lost their house lost their job lost lost their dad lost their mom lost their take your pick of what you could have lost you probably lost it all and yet somehow there's a peace somehow there's a calmness somehow people are looking at you going why aren't you freaking out right now yeah why aren't you pitching a fit why aren't you going through the route that job's wife told him why don't you just Curse God and die yeah and yet instead you're continuing to praise him you're continuing to thank him you're Contin to be grateful for what's left because God calls us to be a different people and God redeemed us because we were there at the beginning because we were that seed at the beginning and so it's the only way we could be redeemed otherwise we wouldn't be brought back to be brought back means you were there at some point and then left and then came back so when we're being brought back and redeemed it's telling us we were there at the beginning there's a seed that's inside us there's a seed that sets us apart and that seed is the seed word which is why we can't get away from the word which is why we keep going back to it which is why you can't be deceived it's why the scripture says that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible if that word wasn't inside you you could be deceived if that seed wasn't planted on the inside you could miss it you could mistake it but that seed on the inside that word on the inside is what holds you to go I can't miss this because it's the word here responding to the word I see in front of me it's the word here responding to the word that's coming over the pulpit it's the word that's inside responding to the word that comes out every time I press press play every time I open up my Bible every time I open up a message book it's the two responding each each other going that's where I came from that's what was at the beginning I'm not interested in just sitting under a man and following what he tells me to do I'm not interested in just sitting and going okay great we're going to study this for four months we're going to do this for four months oh great that's the message I should listen to today we've had the same thing begin to creep in here hey just because maybe this message would be good for me to listen to today God might have it where brother Michael this is the message for you today brother Harry needs what's in that one brother Michael needs what's in that one brother Colby needs what's in that one and brother Ken needs this one over here because we're all at different stages of the J Journey we're all in different places in our walk you know maybe this was a message that I've listened to over and over and over but today is the day that I'm called to get something special out of it today is the day that God's like I'm going to give you a little extra nugget out of it that you've never seen before that you've never caught before and it's not for brother Merl to get that nugget today he's got a different nugget I've got for him he's got a nugget over there or maybe he already got that nugget so he doesn't need to hear it again he's already got that one it's in his possession so he's moved on to the next thing I'm still getting this one back here cuz I didn't get it yet we're all trying to get the complete set we need all the nuggets and I missed that one so I have to go back to that all right well brother Dylan he already got that one so he's going forward and he's picking up this one over here now that's not to say that we can't listen to the same message the same day and maybe we'll grab the same thing but it also doesn't mean that God's not calling us to listen to different ones at different times because he has something ordained for each of us that's right I know we've all had it in our walk where we've listened to a message multiple times but then because of something that you've gone through more recently it hits a little bit different and you see the word just a little bit different than you have in the past and it gets you in a little different place and you see just a little bit different side of the equation you get to see a little bit different side of God's personality and how he works and I had never seen that before I'd never looked at it that way I know for me it was different when I started having children and I became a father suddenly I was seeing things in a whole different way when I would listen to a message and I would be talking about God the Father it meant something different because now I was in that place same thing when you went from being a single person to getting married suddenly there were certain things that stood out a little bit differently as you get a little bit older and your kids are a little bit older there's some things in the message and in the scripture that begin to to stand out a little bit different because they're not babies anymore now I'm starting to deal with teenagers and I've got to handle things a little differently and I've got to be able to respond to things a little differently than I did when they were babies when they're babies you can give them a quick spanking and you're on you're done they get a little older and there needs to be a little more talking a little more explaining a little more showing them the path and showing them the way for the baby it's you're slapping his hand to keep him from burning his hand the older one you're going that's hot don't touch it but I may let you touch it to find out how hot it is so you don't do it again but you begin to talk through it you begin to try to explain the fire that's around them and the things that could burn them in this world where when they're little it's just snatch them out of the street don't let them get hit and so the word opens up to us as we go through these different things in life as we begin to experience different things as you experience loss as you experience pain some of the scriptures that you had read over some of David's laments and different things they begin to mean something a little bit different because now you face some pain now you faced some loss you've seen things through a different set of eyes and now those words stand out in a different way than they did when you were a kid and everything was still pretty easy but God calls us to go back to the word God calls us to hold on to the word the world wants to move away from it the world wants to go well you know that was what the Bible said but that was a book from thousands of years ago go things have been we have to update and so we have this ministry to update to tell us what it means today instead of trusting that a god that is eternal could write a word over 2,000 years ago that still applies in a modern age that still applies to everything that we deal with does he call out cell phones by name no does he need to you can still find the same lessons that apply I know we've heard brother Wendell hit on it a few times over the past several weeks but any of those different things like you can still find scriptures that apply it may not have the term cell phone or internet but you can still find the lessons that apply to it you can still find the same things and the word is just as good today as it was 2,000 plus years ago in the sermon adoption brother brandom says now if the United States of this Fair land here sent me over to Russia as an ambassador of this nation to Russia they even if they have officially sent me to Russia all the power that the United States has is behind me my word is just the same as in the United States if I have been recognized as an ambassador and then if God has sent us to be his Ambassador all the power that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels and all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly an ordained sent Messenger to the people God has come to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatever you bind on Earth that will I bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that will I loose in heaven and I give unto thee the keys to the kingdom oh such great promise he's given to the church the nickan spirit goes and tries to put all the authority with the ministry all the authority goes to the pastor or the bishop or the Archbishop or the Cardinal or the pope or take your pick of which title that denomination uses but all the power all the authority goes to them but the scriptures say you're an ambassador for Christ and brother Brandon lays out clearly if you are an ambassador if you are called and chosen for him then all the authority of the scripture goes with you all the authority of the Kingdom that sent you is behind you that's why brother brandom could share the story of a sister praying for a baby it didn't have to be a minister it didn't have to be the prophet it just had to be someone that was willing to be led by the spirit to go God wants me to pray for this one now we know God uses the ministry we know God uses that office but but that doesn't change that there is an authority that goes along with each one of us as a member of the Bride we are the ambassadors whether we're called to be up behind a Pulpit or not we're still part of that and we still have the authority of the word behind us we're still backed by the kingdom that sent us the same as any Ambassador that's sent by the United States to some foreign country we're still backed by it as long as we're abiding by the word that sent us we don't get to go off on a tangent and say whatever we want but if we keep repeating the word and keep repeating what he said then every bit of authority that's in here is with us the same Authority that's behind any of those ministers when they're praying is behind any brother or sister here that's praying that's why you can have these mothers at home that pray over their kids and the kids get well because God's going to respond to that same prayer of faith whether it's a sister whether it's a brother whether it's a minister whether it's just a member of the congregation if it's the word and Faith applying the word God has to respond nicm wants to take the power away from the leoty wants to take the power away from the congregation and set it on these men that have placed themselves up above but God didn't call that of his people he called a people that would be able to move in the power of the spirit that would move when in inspired by the spirit that could move and whether you're a minister or not if the spirit is leading you to do this then you do [Music] it and you let God use you in that moment whether it's saying a few words on the job site whether it's saying a few words at the grocery store whether it's saying a few words at home whether it's praying for someone even if it's just you in the prayer closet praying for someone because they popped in your mind amen God can use that prayer because he inspired you in that moment to think of this person that's right and put them on your mind he might not have put that on any Minister's mind but instead he chose you right to go I want you to pray for this brother or you to pray for this sister and you may not even know what situation you're praying for you're like I have no clue what struggle they may be facing I have no idea what sickness may be in their body I have no idea what this might be but yet for some reason God keeps putting this person on my heart which makes it my responsibility right and God tells me in the scripture that I have the authority to apply his word the nican spirit wants to take that Authority away and give it to men and God sits here and goes no this is my bride yes there's a Ministry that they have a role to play and they can have gifts in that Ministry but I am not taking the authority away from My bride and my people if I'm leading them and calling them to do this the spirit moves in the leoty just as much as it does in the the ministry because that's his bride page 108 in the in the church age book we're in the last few paragraphs of the Ephesian Church age God's intention for his creation man is to express his word in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that is true is it not but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose Moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then was Satan foiled for he was the one who lived by it is written and the Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word then was this manifested perfect one given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God and now to these sons of God who by him overcame are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never more be any separation from him whether he goes his bride will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who is overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of the test Tony to Jesus Christ how we long for that day when the Crooked roads will all be straightened and we will be with him time Without End May that day hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ if the musicians will come the seed of nickis started in the Ephesian Church age and we know has grown to fruition in this leodan age where now you see it clearly that they want it to be all the power goes to the ministry and the men that are set above and set apart for some reason because they are better called better qualified better whatever you want to call it however you want to describe it but yet God tells us and the prophet tells us that the power and authority of the word is in the bride because we're abiding by the word we're not trying to follow some man-made Doctrine some man-made idea some man-made whatever the word is in us and is calling us back to the word to hold on to everything that he has told us where man where person after person throughout history failed in some way to hold on to the word God has said that there will be a bride in the end time that won't give up on the word that won't move away from it now that doesn't mean that in our flesh we won't still stumble we won't still have some sort of problem we're not suddenly going to be in perfection in this body but our very desire everything thing that's on the inside is to follow exactly what he has called us to what he has instructed us to what he has set in front of us that's our desire that's what we turn back to and when we fall when we trip we run right back to him Lord forgive me I didn't mean to you know I didn't want to do that you know I didn't want to end up in that state because I want to be where you want me to be I want to do what pleases you and if that what if what pleases you is that I'm the one who steps up and prays for a brother or sister then Lord that's what I want to do Lord if what pleases you is that I'm going to get up when the noname minister is up there because you're leading me to go to the altar or to go up for prayer then Lord that's what I'm going to do I'm not holding on to some man-made idea that I has to be at this minister or see this person in order to get what I'm needing I have to follow the leading of the spirit now the spirit could use a bigname minister absolutely I'm not in any way putting down any Ministry but I'm trying to make it so clear that it's the spirit of nickis that sets men above others that sets men apart where God is saying this is my bride and my bride has the authority amen my bride can apply this word and I can use the greatest or I can use the least because it's still my bride and that Authority is still there Amen brother Colby what can we [Music] sing will follow me I will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord and I will go Lead Me Lord and I will follow Lead Me Lord [Music] you have called me I will answer me Lord I will go let's raise our hands and sing that again Lead Me Lord and I will follow leave me

You've you chose us before the foundation of the world that that we would be able to see this Lord that we would be able to see your word that we would be able to receive that Revelation Lord we thank you for calling us Lord we thank you for choosing us Lord help us to to hold on to the word the way that we should Lord Jesus to to hold on to to every word that you speak Lord Lord help us not to to fall into that mindset of elevating one manner over another Lord or are thinking of someone higher than another Lord you've called us to be a body you've called us to be your bride Lord Jesus Lord you've given us the authority of your word Lord Lord may you help us to be more sensitive to follow the leading of your spirit Lord Jesus that that when you lead that we will follow that we will will fall in step to what direction you're taking us and what you would have us to do Lord Lord I pray that you would be with all those that weren't able to make it this evening Lord those that are that
