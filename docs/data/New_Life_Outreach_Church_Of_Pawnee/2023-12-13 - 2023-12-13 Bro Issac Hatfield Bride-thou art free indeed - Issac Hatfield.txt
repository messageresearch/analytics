had him back at our place in Ohio just a week or two ago and such a blessing to us him and brother Josh and always been a blessing and we just love them so much and uh just uh glad to have my little family with me now a little addition different traveling with a baby and we were just down in Branson and uh just the Lord made a way just to come on over and you we just thank the Lord amen and just thankful to be in the house of the Lord do you love them amen if you have your Bibles we'll go straight to the word and don't want to hold you long tonight we'll turn to two texts but we'll start in Galatians 4 vers 22 starting Galatians 4 verse 22 amen I'm happen to use brother Josh's Bible tonight because I went to a Bible Conference and forgot my Bible so that's a little embarrassing but he was gracious all right Galatians 4 and then we'll turn over to John 8 Galatians 4:22 says for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bond made the other by a free woman yeah but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the Mount Si which gendereth to bondage which is AAR for this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written Rejoice thou baren that bearest not and break forth and cry thou that travest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be a with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free yes and then in John 8 uh just a few verses here starting in verse 31 it says then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered and we be Abraham seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free then Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and then verse 33 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word and then down to verse 4 7 he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God am mean we could bow our heads for a word of prayer father we just thank you Lord for your grace father that you've extended to us Lord and Lord we look back father where we came from father when we realize it could only be the tender hand of God Lord that could guide us through Lord great trials and heartaches father of life and to realize Lord that it was all part of your plan father and you purposed it Lord and you ordained us Lord before the foundation of the world Lord to walk with you and father Lord we grew Lord through through all the the dirt and the Darkness of this life into Lord the revelation of knowing who we are father Lord that you've called us and elected us for this hour and father Lord we just ask that you come by this way Lord that if there be one that doesn't know who they are father that Lord they be in in the darkness Lord or deep trial maybe some sick in their body father Lord that you come by Lord in your great power and might and just speak to the hearts of your children Lord have your way we pray in Jesus name amen and you may be seated just want to take a short thought out of those texts on bride Thou Art free indeed uh free indeed it's just really been something uh just dealing with my heart on on freedom and how the truth has set us free and and what Freedom really means and brother brandom um preaches the message a Year of Jubilee and return and Jubilee and and lays under that thought of Jubilee and and how the children of Israel had an inheritance uh and Joshua was placing them in that inheritance each one where they belonged in their specific position and and no one could take their spot but there was a an adoption a placing of the children of Israel in each position but in the course of time they could lose their inheritance due to Poverty or different situations and and they could fall away from the right position but God provided a way that after 50 years there would be a jubilee and at the sounding of the trumpet there that they could return back to their inheritance that that had God had given them as children of Israel that they could return back and no matter what had taken place no matter where they found themselves God provided a way that they could return back to their inheritance and as we read in John 8 it said the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever and brother Brandon would take that scripture and show you that Jubilee isn't just for it's not for servants actually it's for Sons it's for sons that were children of Israel born Israelites not for servants that were that were bought or or selected but it was for born Sons you had to be born into it just the same as brother Brandon would take the S on Jubilee and parallel it with the adoption of the church that it's for born Sons those who before the foundation of the world were predestinated under this adoption that's who this Jubilee is for it's not just for anybody it's not just for the world or or the natural church but it's for born sons that could hear the sound of the trumpet and that they could return to their inheritance as children of God and walk free in the light that God God had called him to amen so it wasn't just for anybody but it was for somebody that could know the sound of the trumpet amen and Grace could return them to their rightful inheritance no matter how far they had gone away and brother bam said I believe this is the hour of Jubilee again only this time it's not not a priest sounding a natural trumpet right but it's a gospel Minister a preacher sounding forth the gospel declaring the Jubilee that if you're a Son of God if you can recognize the sound of the trumpet as a sheep hears the voice of the shepherd you can follow it and go free back to your inheritance as children of God for for man was not made to be a slave man was made to be free man was never made to be ruled over by man or to be ruled over by by anything else other than random would say that that you're a Freeborn servant of God you don't want nobody to be slaves nothing to dominate over us but himself mean that's the only Dominion that we have is almighty God over our lives no man is to dominate over us no Creed no Dogma no denomination you were never meant to be a slave to any of that the only headship that we have brother Josh is the word of the hour the message that God sent us he's our only Dominion he's our only headship no other headship no other rulership we not in bondage anymore but we've been liberated amen by the word of the hour and we're free we're we're not meant to be uh slaves or or ruled over by by these things and you can see brother Brandon's attitude on slavery for he would look out at a natural slavery how they would sell them he said just like a like a used car sell that they would just uh sell humans to other humans it was pitiful to to see that he said it should never be and and he would look to Abraham Lincoln as a little bit of a role model cuz Abraham Lincoln would look out on that and say he said I'll hit it if it takes my life I'll hit this slavery if it takes my life and brother Brandon would look out upon humanity and the unbelief that plagued sons and daughters and he said I'll hit it if it takes my life I will not stand here and let Sons and Daughters of God be caged by the cunningness of man but I will hit it if it takes my life I'll preach the word and Truth I'll preach it in Clarity I'll preach it without any opinion because there's got to be a people who will live free outside of this cage he would look and said the saddest thing I ever saw was that eagle in the cage beating its head beating its wings Against the Cage an eagle that was born for the sky Born to Be Free the saddest side I ever saw but not as sad as the the men and woman that would walk down the streets and here this Eagle was caged by Humanity Humanity put them in that cage he said I see men and women walking down the street but but they're not CA they're caged by the cunningness of man spiritually under religious C men who wouldn't preach the whole truth but they build a kingdom of their own and put Humanity in a cage and limit them to their idea but but not preach to them the full word that they could walk in Liberty but there was a prophet on the scene that could take the word and preach it in power in fullness that Sons and Daughters of God could walk in the liberty of the word not caged by any man amen it's a liberty Amen brother brandom uh had that about him he had that desire for freedom for Liberty to see children of God Walk in Freedom man was not made to rule over man uh brother Brandon would say uh you know uh that that man was not made to rule over man but on the day of Pentecost he sent the Holy Ghost to rule in the hearts of men he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I will send you a leadership I'll send you something to lead you you're not meant to be ruled over by man you see the children of Israel in the olden days when they would go through the desert am mean Almighty God would rule over them he would lead them into battle and brother brand say he was a king to them he was a father King he busied himself over them he took care of them he fed him can you imagine just being led by a pillar of fire through the Wilderness and he's fighting your battles a pillar of cloud he's drowning your enemies in the sea you can you imagine that kind of a a victory but then they looked out brother Josh and they seen the armies of the Philistines and they seen all these other armies and they had a natural King to leave lead them into battle and they begin to covet that and say we want a king like them to lead us into battle and said we don't want to change anything we still want to blow the trumpets we still want to sing the songs but we want natural leadership instead of the leadership of almighty God and when they did that they rejected the very thing that made them different it wasn't the trumpets that made them different it wasn't the songs that made them different it was the leadership of the Holy Ghost that made them different that's what caused the signs and wonders to follow him that's what caused them to be victorious in battle not just the priest or the singing But the leadership and of almighty God the pillar of fire leading the church is what made him different he said oh we'll still sing the songs we'll still quote the quotes we'll still dress right and do our hair long but we don't want that Holy Ghost leadership and they rejected the very thing that made them different and chose rather to be ruled over by Humanity they would rather have Saul the son of Kish to lead him and even though Saul couldn't produce what the leadership of God could produce but there's something about man that wants to be ruled over by man and they want to rule over man but Humanity rejects the leadership of God like this nation rejected real leadership of God brother brandom said and then astounded me when when when they were signing the Declaration of Independence he said there's not one Speck in my mind the son of God sat at that table it wasn't a speck in the prophet's mind that when this nation was founded the Son of God sat in the room when this nation was founded but they rejected it they rejected it for the what the world had to offer and we're not meant we've been freed from the rulership of man but but it doesn't do away say well if that's the case I'll just go out and I'll just listen to tapes I'll just I don't need I don't need Pastor I don't need the Evangelist but that's not what it means because almighty God set an order to this leadership brother BR said I believe in leadership but I also believe God has set men in the church who will lead and who who will take care of all order but but but because they're Spirit-filled men it's not really the leadership of man it's the leadership of God by the word through those men so you're not really subjecting yourself to any other leadership it's just God has placed man in the church to Lead You by Holy Ghost leadership amen so if you got a real god- calleded Pastor it's not a different agenda than what God has it's not a different a different a plan than what this message has but it's just the spirit leading through Humanity but almighty God is still our headship amen we're not meant to be prisoners to man or to church to church systems we've been called out of it we've been called out of the systems brother Wendell we're not meant to be ruled over by it um you know brother Brandon would talk to many people many times and say well you know are you are you a Christian said I'll give you to know I burn a candle every night I'll give you to know I'm a Methodist I'm a presbyterian I'm a Baptist that that has nothing to do with it is that people can get down at an altar and have maybe somewhat of a sensation uh in the denominational systems they would have an experience but they would get up and and they would have no love for the Lord they would have no real walk all they would talk about is well my church this in my church that because they really didn't never get the spirit of God they got a church Spirit instead of the spirit of God and there's a big difference between a church Spirit and the spirit of God but when God gets a hold of your life he'll change you it's spirit in you you don't love the world or the things of the world anymore you've got a different leadership it's the leadership of almighty God and it's a huge difference and I don't think we should water down the true baptism of the Holy Ghost just to just to a church Spirit just to belong to a group or pH a Pew but when you're born of God you're a new creature deity dwells inside of you it'll change your life it'll teach you how to walk it'll teach you how to talk it'll dissolve all doubts about this message because it's not a church spirit almighty God dwells inside of your being he's the one leading you it's not a church Spirit don't be deceived in your experience to be a Christian is to be Christlike me it's the Bride versus the church as we read the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman one is the bride brother BR said they'll not be heirs together they're not associated together they're absolutely two different promises two different times two different peoples all together one is the bride and the other one is a church no comparison in them at all just as Ishmael and Isaac could not be airs together the bride and the church cannot be hirs together it's completely different it's brother Ram said the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be HS together they are two different separate times two different separate people under two different separate covenants you're not under the same Covenant you're not you're not the same as the natural Church you're different and it's important to know who you are and what promises belong to you for for you're a special people you're his bride and you're under a different Covenant you're not under the law of Mount Si you're not under the law and the dictatorship of men but you're under grace you're his Covenant people you're you're part of Abraham's Grace Covenant because you're not just a you're not just a part of ishmail or you're not even you're not even didn't maybe necessarily come through the natural heritage of Abraham and Isaac but you're a part of that third son that Royal seed almighty God you're a seed of Christ because by one Spirit you've been baptized into one body it said Not seeds as many but seed which is one it's Christ seed it's the Royal seed it's the free seed you're free from the bondage of this world you're not a part of the church you're under a different Covenant that's why the Rapture is only for the bride it's not for the church you got to recognize who you are in the scripture what belongs to you if you want to recognize your true Freedom you must know know who you are not just talking about the freedom of the church not just talking about the freedom of the world this Freedom belongs specifically to the bride and so you must know who you are what you're in a of what promises you're under what Covenant you under it's a Grace Covenant and God only recognized the token Covenant people there's no comparison brother BR said there's no comparison in them at all and there's always a clash with that spiritual and that natural you see those two Vines go down through scripture there's always been a class brother Caleb there's been a class with Cain and Abel with Jacob and Esau and Joseph and his brother because because they were his half Brethren they weren't they they they they persecuted him because he was spiritual because he could see visions and dream dreams what was it brother wend was little petty jealousies got up and they persecuted him because he was a little bit more spiritual and they just couldn't handle that and so that natural Church always persecutes that spiritual church and you must know whose side you're on and what your types are for Eve is not your type but Eve is a type of the natural church that's why they that's why that's why they they you know they don't just take every word but but but but because eel it's a type of this natural church that that goes into Creeds and different things but it's not your type but the thing is they cannot beat their type because that's who they are and they can't beat their type because Eve is their type so if you realize who you are and what your type is then you can rest assured knowing that you cannot beat your type and Eve is not my type but brother wend Enoch is my Tye and Abraham ties me and rahab's my Tye and I can look through that scripture through the strain of Almighty God's seed and realize what God did through them brother Colby and I realize that's my type and mean that's the air that's the Covenant I'm under amen come out from amongst it and be separate touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you brother brand said I'm a segregationist I don't think anyone taught Fellowship better than brother brandham but brother Bram said I'm a segregationist he said you cannot be a Christian and be an integrationist now I don't know if I found the exact right definition but I found a definition of that it says to bring together or incorporate Parts into a whole to make up combine or complete to produce a whole or a larger unit as parts do and brother bam said you cannot be that and be a Christian he said I'm a segregationist he said not like slavery not like this the segregation of slavery where man rules over man he said but there is a segregation the bride of Christ is segregated from the rest of the churches you're a segregated people you're separate people you're not meant to mix with this world you're not meant to mix with the church in fact brother Brandon would would preach the invisible Union and he would illustrate it as law and Grace being marriage and divorce he said you're you cannot be married to both but that old husband has to be dead divorced buried you cannot have both you cannot be under but in fact you are the elect lady you are misg grac you come under a different Covenant and you're a free people you're a born people and you're a segregated people we've been called out of that to come into this message to come into Christ the fullness of this word it's not a false Unity brother Josh as brother Brandon would say they say in the m mude of counselors there is safety but he said it matters who you're counseling with he said Ahab that that proved to be a lie to the story of Ahab because they had 400 different ones that they sought counsel with and they all said to go up you know you're going to win but there was a Micaiah in the land who who couldn't speak that because he was he was a Son of God and and I think it was Micaiah forgive me if I got it wrong but but there was a prophet though 400 voices the multitude of counselors said go up there was a voice in the land that spoke differently and me when David was trying to to to to bring the ark back to the temple and they try to do it through through through through counseling with with the thousands of captains and the host and they counseled and they did it the the way the counselors thought they should do it they did it the way that natural man thought they should do it and here there was Nathan in the land a Vindicated prophet and brother bam said there Vindicated Prophet stood in their midst and they never even consulted them and an innocent man lost his life through the multitude of counsel sometimes it may become a false Unity though that scripture has a place that was not the place for it because they didn't even consult the Vindicated prophet and you can look out and no matter if there's hundreds or thousands of different opinions about this word or about this message and all the whole time there's a Vindicated prophet in our midst and you didn't even consult them when there's an answer right there and when you find this message it's the answer no matter what the multitude of World Council of churches has to say I have found my refuge in this Vindicated word I don't need to seek a second opinion or a third opinion I found my answer about water baptism and the godhead and the great Mysteries I found it in this word and mean that's the unity I believe in a Unity with the word a Unity under the shed blood under the shed blood there is fellowship this bride is in fellowship with her mate with the revealed word there's no divis ision amongst us for how can two walk together lest they be agreed how can you walk with someone else's opinion and this message you must walk with the word God is looking for men and women who will be prisoners to this word amen and for that matter I can't even walk with my own opinion in this message I've got to lay it aside every thought that I have contrary to this word belongs dead and buried it's a lie and it's contrary this message alone is my leadership it's my Heritage it's my it's my headship amen you must forsake every opinion amen every man must come God is calling every man to separation not just those who came out of the Baptist Church naturally but you may have been born in this message and God is calling every man to separation you see it might not be a denomination naturally but a denominational mentality that you carry right in a message church God is calling you to separation if it's contrary to this word you get under that little bit of legalism in your mind and the pastor may not even teach it brother Brandon didn't teach it but in your mind you get under this denominational mentality under a legalism or a formalism or a fanaticism and you must separate from that lay it down if it doesn't line up with this word then you must separate he said come out from among it come out from among and and be be born into this message and I will receive you amen you see the pilgrims had to come out they left their Creeds for the anointed word they left their Creeds for Religious Freedom and brother BR said God has separated us from all the dead religions and what did he do he opened us a new land a new message for this day you see CU I I can just maybe imagine that there was some that came out brother Wendell out of that land into this American land many of them were seeking true religious freedom many of them were seeking real freedom because they were trying to operate under that bondage and and it wasn't working and so they they responded to the call to the poll to come to freedom but I just wonder maybe if there was some on the boat that maybe just came out because their parents came out or or just because everyone else was doing it and they didn't really come out with that same desire but they just came out because it was It was kind of cool they come a little bit farther than they were but they brought their chains over on the boat and they brought their chains into this new land and they got over here and begin to operate under the same bondage under the same religious bondage and so that's why you cannot bring those chains into this message you see the Lutheran had to die out to that age to be born into the Methodist age the Methodist had to die out to be born to the Pentecostal age and brother Bram said don't bring your denomination over in the new message this is the word now don't bring those chains over into this new message those chains of legalism those chains of uh just to believe God sent a prophet and you're okay those chains of of of false baptism and all those chains they don't belong in this new message this is our freedom brother Josh this is our Liberty brother Austin this is not our bondage that's why we left those things behind is for freedom and for Liberty we didn't leave just to just to come into a different building you didn't build a new building just so you could have a better place just to sit but you built a new building so so you could you know you have a place where you could have have comfort and you can be established and we did not leave those systems just to come into a little bit better place but we left for Freedom we left for our Liberty amen and those chains don't belong here am mean if you want to stay Bound in those chains that's okay but this message is my Liberty it's my freedom I'm not willing to give up my only Liberty for a little bit of idea or a little bit of opinion I'm not willing to give up my only joy and my only freedom for a little bit of compromise this is my fre Freedom this is my joy this is the the very solution to my life amen and none no chains belong here amen just that chain in your mind that chain that tells you you're never going to make it that chain that holds you down from really worshiping the Lord those complexes that hold you down they don't belong in this new message this is the word now this is the word this is your Liberty those complexes those habits they don't belong in this message this is your freedom you've been called out of those things that's why God sent us that we could have a liberty we could have a refuge and they don't belong here you got to lay them aside sir brother Brandon said that's why I stepped away from the Baptist Church Hallelujah I believe my God ought to be worshiped in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost I don't believe in your old cold formal Creeds he wants to be loved look at him setting over there can't be loved he can't be loved because the way he's treated you see brother brandom had to leave the Baptist Church that he could worship God in power and demonstration he couldn't stay there he had to die out to those things but brother Brandon was an elect he knew the voice of the shepherd he knew the GU and he could follow amen and when that word came by his way brother wend when that light struck across your path those walls fell down because you were a son you see part of the Jubilee was that anything in a walled City could not be free if you if you had something in a walled City and you didn't redeem redem it back within a year then it couldn't go free in the Jubilee and brother Brandon would take that and talk about denominations that were walled up he said and if you're so walled up that you know the truth comes by your way and you say oh I've heard that before when that Jubilee comes it's not for you but because you were an elect there was something in you looking for that and longing for that because you were always an eagle though you were in a chicken yard th those chicken walls that were around you could not hold you because soon as that light flashed across your path that seed came to life and those walls fell down and you walked free amen because there was a seed something in you come out from among them is that if there ever was a coming out time it ought to be now God has ordained his people to act different from the world you're not meant to be fit in brother Colby it's becoming of you to be different it's becoming of you to be a separated people amen and if you if you reject that you've rejected the very thing that made you different if you you reject the the the reality of this message you rejected the very thing that makes you different almighty God that reality the moving of the spirit in your life that Pillar of Fire that's leading this church to the Millennium amen don't reject that don't reject that that's What Makes You Different you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light brother BR said were Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostals and what more we're all the same he said we are not the same we are a separated people holy onto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God and he says you're not of them we are not the same you're a separated people that that that the inheritance that belongs to them doesn't belong to you you are not HS with the Bond woman you're heirs with the free woman and when Joshua was leading the children to their inheritance he would have to command and we going to pass by Esau's Mountain but just remember that's not your inheritance don't fuss with them don't try to proelite them that's their Mountain but your Mountain lays beyond the Jordan you're not even on the same side of the Jordan as them you've crossed over into your inheritance you're always meant to believe this message you're always meant for this mountain you always meant for the third pole and the spoken word and the Rapture that was always your inheritance and because you were Sons this Jubilee was meant for you and it called you out of all your Creeds and your Darkness you heard the trumpet sound and it called your name you heard from your theophany when you recognize this message as Eagle food and you said I can return I can return to my joy I can return to my peace I can return to my inheritance I can return to the reality where I know my name is on that last book of life God put it there and no man can take it away you have a right to return to full blessing it's your land that Esau's mountain is not for you don't fuss with them don't stop there and take a pit stop go on pass them to your land you can't help that they can't see it they were never meant to see it but blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears brother Austin for they hear jubile is for the elect it's for the sons it's not your inheritance but oh to you where the deep is calling to the Deep to you where just going to church wasn't enough to you where just sitting on the and the front row wasn't enough it was a deep calling I got to get to a reality brother Colby is that right there's something that was in you since you were a child something in you that was different than the rest of your friends out in the world it was something in you tugging you pulling you you were always different that election that election in your life proving that you were never meant for this chicken yard Amen brother Josh you were always meant to be a preacher of this message brother Wendell you were always meant for this message but one day you heard that trumpet sound and and because you were a son you could return to your Jubilee amen we're not meant to we're not meant for these things uh it just doesn't feel right to be under bondage for a Son of God or a daughter of God it just doesn't feel right there's something about it says there's a better way that legalism that tries to creep in brother Josh uh it's it's like it's if legalism and that those mind battles it it feels like an eagle beating its head against a cage thinking if I make a mistake I'm going to hell if I mess up I'm going to hell if my dress is 1 in too short or too long I'm going to hell under that legalism that that I got to do it I've got to I've got to have my hair long just to set a rules and regulations and not a love it's a cage but for an eagle he doesn't belong in that cage you're not meant for that cage of legalism and brother bandam doesn't just keep it just a just a dress length but he keeps it to the spiritual even dancing and shouting he said there's a legalism there that said if I don't shout I'm not going to make it if I don't speak in tongues and I don't have the Holy Ghost it's a legalism but this bride has been called out of legalism into full Liberty into full adoption into full placement in the word for your hour because your name were written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world whether you shout or not it doesn't matter if you dance or not it doesn't matter you've been liberated by almighty God when he called you as a son he put your name he spoke it with his you're just asur to make it as he made it oh because the spoken word will not return void but when Jesus Christ came and died on that cross before the foundation of the world he was the lamb slain nothing could stop him from dying on that cross and nothing can stop you brother Austin who was spoken before the foundation of the world as an attribute of God and sent into this Earth Hallelujah you say I've never spoken tongues brother Isaac I mean I believe it's available I believe you can but even if you don't you don't have to lay awake at night wondering if you have the Holy Ghost because you didn't speak in tongues we've been loosed of that this message freed us into the reality of the word amen it's not resting on that it's the person of Jesus Christ that has come into your life he dwells inside of you he's your guide he's leading you into all truth amen but I sure love to dance I sure love to shout because I am free I sure love it I sure enjoy it Amen brother Brandon said if they shout all right if they don't all right if they do this all right if they don't all right for God has already said so it has to come to pass amen he said we find out after this dis dispensation it lasted on he said that LE this this was amazing to me he said that legalistic dispensation lasted until the Royal seed came but he taken all the legalism upon himself and paid the price of redemption and God's church is back in Grace again not under the law and legalism it's under grace and the promise of God the true Seed of Abraham and mean we don't operate legally we didn't come to church tonight legally I mean you may have come with sickness brother Josh may have had a hobble through the door but there's something in them it's a love for his Lord It's a relationship and mean and maybe you've been in that place before I mean I've been there as a child I always enjoyed a good excuse to miss church I always you know if I was a little bit sick and or someone if Mom was staying home I'd be a good volunteer to stay home but now I'll I'll drive across the country just to be in a meeting I'll drive I'll drive day and night just to go to church something changed I broke loose of that cage and I found a relationship with my savior and now I'm a love slave a love slave to this word and me we don't operate under legalism brother BR said the he said you you come to the legal side he said there you come to the legal side again if I did this if I did that he said never go to the legal side it's negative amen and forgive give me if it's too much reading but this is so good the positive side is what you want and now brother brandom's telling us which side to go to and that's good enough for me he said never go to the legal side he said the positive side is what you want it's already a finished work Christ died and the sin was killed when he died and if God for ordained you to eternal life all the father has given me will come to me there you are can't be lost you're secured forever for by one Spirit we're baptized into one body and one one sacrifice he has perfected forever there you are there's no way for us to lose correctly now don't it make you feel good amen don't it make you feel good he said never go to the negative side never go to the legal side remember who you are amen now I'm not just trying to make it so loose this is the freedom of the bride and mean this may not apply to the church this may not apply to your neighbor but for the bride you've been loosed from legalism you've been loose from formalism and fanaticism you have found a way that the light has lit upon your path and you're walking in a fully revealed word Amen brother Brandon would type that to Ruth the stages of the church he said Ruth worked through the stages of legalism trying to find favor with Boaz he said like the Methodist you know that was built upon works and and even he said to the stages of Pentecost that that you know you got to do a certain thing you got to shout or do a certain thing but Ruth came to that place with Boaz where he became her Kinsman and she was no longer depending upon work to find favor but she had reached the favor with Boaz and then she could rest Ruth could rest and this church is resting you're not wondering if you're going to go across brother Miguel you're not wondering if you're going to make it you've worked through those stages and now you're resting oh he's your Kinsman he's redeemed you you're loosed God sent us a message to call us out of that confusion God sent us a word amen calling from both sides to come out and he gave us the spirit of Truth John 16:13 it says how be when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen aren't you thankful for a spirit of Truth God sent a spirit of Truth he didn't just send a message to call you out but he gave you a guide he gave you something to lead you he didn't just leave you hanging on the outside of the the denominational cities but he gave you a guide to lead you and he said what is he leading you into he's leading you into truth what is truth it's the word and me brother man said for he shall speak he shall not speak of himself but what he hears will speak when he hears he'll speak other words he'll be the one that will reveal the thing you see that Spirit of Truth is the revealer God sent a spirit of Truth he did not leave us comfortless brother Josh but he sent us a guide in this last age uh spirit that could tie all the loose ends together of reformers in days gone by because there wasn't an open word brother Brandon said that explains why all the mistakes has been done down Through the Ages because the seals were not open but he said now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word there's been a spirit of truth that has revealed these great mysteries in in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished the spirit of Truth is the revealer he's revealed these words words he's revealed these truths and brother Austin we don't have to question baptism and godhead and serpent seed we're not wandering around the Wilderness anymore the spirit of Truth has revealed it and that re that revealed truth brother Miguel is what sets us free that's the type of Freedom I'm talking about I'm not just talking about it up one day and down the next I'm talking about the truth has set us free the truth that set you free to worship the truth that set you free to live under this message you're not living in fear you're not living in bondage you're not living in confusion God is not the author of confusion but God has sent a guide to lead you and guide you this is not a Revival of feeling free this is a Revival of being free you're not just feeling free we didn't just come to church tonight happy because of a feeling this is the Revival of being free you know you're free because the truth has set you free am mean there's no more confusion I like what brother Wayne said in the Bible Conference we don't lay our head on the pillow as night at night wondering if we've been baptized right that's not a fear for us we're not in the cage any longer the truth has set you free you know you're baptized right you know you're going in the Rapture you know you're the bride you've been properly identified by the message of the hour properly identified by the spirit of truth brother Brandon would wander through that Wilderness on his honeymoon he took his wife up there he he did a little little trick a little two and one I'm going to take you on my honeymoon and combine it with my hunting trip amen and I'm going to try to kill us some deer so we'll have meat for the winter and so he got out there uh meat for the year he was trying to kill a deer so he left his wife and baby and he went out into the woods and here he was just kind of thinking of of what a guide he was and how he can never get lost and you know how how how he could never you know he could never end up lost in that Wilderness cuz he knew he knew the woods he was a real guide and but he began to walk and he got his deer but all of a sudden a storm began to roll in and he begin to begin to kind of get a little turned around and he begin to see a mark and and maybe tried to find his way back and then all a sudden he' come back to his deer again and there his deer was hanging and he come back he did that two or three times and he realized that he was in what the Indians call the death walk uh he wasn't he wasn't getting anywhere he was lost and he could try to convince himself that he was okay but his subconscious just couldn't couldn't agree because the subconscious doesn't lie he knew he knew he was lost he knew he was in a problem he knew he was in a real trouble but he just began to hear a voice I'm an ever presentent help in the time of trouble I'm an everpresent help in the time of trouble and he began to walk and all of a sudden he got down on his knees and began to pray to the Lord and repent for thinking that he was a hunter for thinking that he was a GU say Lord forgive me I need your help I need to find my wife I need to find my baby and there he got up and he began to walk again he said okay I've got to make a decision I'm going to go this way but all of a sudden a hand took him by the shoulder and began to turn him around and the fog cleared back and he saw that Hurricane Mountain he would have went the wrong way but a hand turned him around and he began to walk with his hands up and he would feel Limbs and think it was a wire but it wasn't and he said see it couldn't be on certain sound that trumpet had to be a certain sound but then he found that wire and he grabbed a hold of it and he could Rejoice because that wire was going to take him home it was no longer Waring with it it was no longer wandering he could Rejoice because he found a hold of that absolute and that absolute would take him all the way home he found a hold of a word that would not fail and I think my there in his Humanity brother Josh he would have went the wrong way in his Humanity he was fixing to go the opposite way and a hand turned him around and I think my that same hand maybe was in the room when he was preaching the seals and he said I was about to make a huge mistake I was about to come out with this what I saw in my Humanity I studied the the commentaries but I was about to make a huge mistake until the Holy Spirit came in the run and turned him around you see there was a natural man that could get lost but there was a spirit of truth that was leading them and guiding them that wouldn't let him walk the wrong way but he preached a message and he set a straight in nrow path that a bride could come behind it and follow it in all truth in the full truth that we have an absolute we're not wondering if we're going to make it we got a hold of that wire brother Wendell and it's taking us home it's taking us us all the way to the Millennium it's an absolute it's the spirit of Truth and it's guiding you into all truth and it's giving you a freedom of Freedom a Liberation you don't have to be in a cage anymore the truth has set you free the truth has declared who you are it's the reveal truth amen you're free and I'm free tonight I'm free but what am I free to be I'm free to be a prisoner I'm free to be a prisoner to this message I'm free to be a prisoner to this word I'm free you say well if I'm sealed if I'm free then I can just go and listen to all these other voices I can go on these websites I can study the other man because I'm I'm free I'm sealed but that's not what it's about you're getting back into legalism again it's a love relationship as brother Brandon would say I don't worry about my wife when I leave I'm not worried that I I can't do something wrong or else she was going to do something wrong it's a love relationship and I don't just lean on this message because I have to it's a love relationship I have found the one who my soul loves it's the revealed word I don't have to listen to any other voices I don't desire to go out and listen and look at other things I have found the one who my soul loves it's the word it's an absolute and brother Brandon said there's something about an absolute it seems like when when when people find an absolute that negative side just goes away because you have the word you you have the positive anden you're not wondering or questioning you've got an answer and you're led by the spirit of Truth amen amen the sons and daughters follow it brother Brandon would say but you see it says even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive and mean as we read in John it said he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God and in 1 John 4 said we are of God he that he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you see brother brandom in his early Ministry taught that the baptism the evidence of the Holy Ghost uh uh what would be the uh fruits of the spirit and love and different things but but he said God corrected me in a vision one day and showed me that it wasn't just love or it wasn't just the fruits of the spirit but it was to receive the word for your day would be the true genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost for for it blew my mind but he said the Pharisees had a million times more fruits of the spirit than Jesus did because they had I knew the fruits of the spirit wasn't the evidence but but it blew my mind when we said the the th those priests and things had a million times more fruits of the spirit for they were gentle and kind but when the word came into the building he he broke up the services and he kicked them out and he braided whips and that was the word and so fruits was just the evidence then then then then the the Pharisees and the the religious sect would have them be but when the word came in and me that which had received the word amen it it followed obedience to this to the to the father amen and you see there's a difference between just just a human compassion and a Divine compassion uh you know just the fruits of the spirit might say oh uh Don't Preach it so hard you might hurt someone's feelings uh be a little gentler you got to show love but Divine compassion does the will of God Divine compassion doesn't compromise with any word amen this word brother Brandon said the now the word doesn't use any compassions it has got to be obeyed stay with the word no matter how bad it cuts amen but human compassion is different but I thank God for men of God like your pastor that can get up behind this pulpit and preach the word and sometimes you may get offended and sometimes you may not always understand and thinks that he doesn't love you but the reason he does love you that's why he does it because he's got more than human sympathy for you he's got Divine compassion for you to do the will of God to preach the word of God Amen he's been loosed of that halfway religion that halfway yoke of bondage into the Liberty amen and because that love that love will produce correction amen the Bible says thy rod and thy staff comfort me and brother random say that's the hard preaching of the Gospel it come comforts you because you know he loves you enough to correct you and because you are Sons you have the ability to receive it you're built to receive that correction because it comes from the word amen and that's the evidence you see this Jubilee is for Sons but the very evidence of the Holy Ghost is that you can receive the message for your day you're in the word all the way and me because you are Sons you could hear this message you could receive this message and you can't separate the spirit from the word because the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the word so how could you receive the spirit of the word and not receive the word but when you receive the Holy Ghost you would receive this message it would be an Evidence Onto You amen because that Jubilee was for you you recognize the sound of that trumpet you recognize the sound of this message because it wasn't for the bondswoman it wasn't for the servants it was for sons and you've been marked you see those who those who turn down the word they got the all in their ear that they could never you they they were marked that they can't hear the Glorious gospel no more but brother BR said when a man when a man turns down the gospel truth St Marks and wearing his ear he deafens them so he can't hear the truth no more but it said uh but but but but you can't get away from the mark for brother man said God marks his when they come God God marks his by vindicating his promised word through them you've been marked but you've been marked by God you've been marked where where where these signs shall follow them that believe believe and and these Greater Works shall you do anden you haven't been marked where you can't hear that word no more but you've been marked where it's manifested through your life amen and you cannot be deceived because you're a part of the elect why can't you be deceived because you are the word you are the very word and you cannot be deceived amen and we see that this is a free bride we see that this bride has been loosed but to the individual sometimes in the message they can be bound and Paul taught us that that stand fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage you see brother brandom someone asked him one time said I was married uh to a woman and the first marriage was good but they were divorced and she'd been married again and again and he's wondering if if he should return to her or or if he's free and brother Bram said you are free stay free don't go back again no sir she's married somebody else stay away from her that's right and brother Brandon would would show us in the invisible Union that that old nature is dead that old law nature is dead that old man is dead and when you get the Holy Ghost brother Austin and you know that you met God on those sacred Sands and that devil tries to bring that past up and tries to get you to go back and check that seal go back and check that but brother said don't dig him up he's dead that old Nature's dead don't try to resurrect him he's dead and when God fills you with the Holy Ghost and he kicks that door shut you're sealed and you don't have to go back and keep checking that seal he's divorced he's dead you're a new creature in Christ and do not return again to that yoke of bondage do not return again to that yoke of halfway do not return again to that yoke of partial word we've got full word we've got full life and you don't have to return to that yoke of bondage it's a free Church you're not yolked up with anything amen sometimes that yoke of fear comes upon you and it's a heavy yoke it weighs heavy that yoke of fear you wake up afraid you go to bed afraid you're afraid you're going to miss the Rapture you're afraid this message is isn't for you you're afraid God doesn't love you you're afraid you're going to go to hell it's a heavy yoke it's a heavy yoke but God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and you don't have to give place to that devil we've been commanded don't give place to that devil you see that Devil's trying to get in but but so is there a true God trying to get in and that devil trying to get in and sometimes I think maybe because of our Humanity it's so much easier to choose the lower route it's so much easier to choose the lie because you think that's what you deserve you think that's really what your future is going to be and so you choose the lie and and then all a sudden because you were afraid he begins to pour condemnation on you because that yoke of condemnation I many times follows that yoke of fear it seems to me that they sometimes paired together because you're you're afraid and then you're condemned for being afraid you think I'm a Christian so I shouldn't fear I shouldn't have these mind battles and all of a sudden you can't hardly pray to the Lord all of a sudden you can't hardly talk to them because you think my I'm supposed to be a Christian but maybe I'm not and that yoke of condemnation begins to build and that yoke of fear begins to build and so you begin to get under this this weight of the world is going with you everywhere you go a great cloud of Oppression when you were always meant to be an eagle you were never meant to be in that cage and you're carrying that lie around wherever you go that nobody loves you that the pastor doesn't love you that you're not going to make it that the Rapture isn't for you because it's so much easier to accept the lie but what does the truth say about it have you ever looked and saw what the word said about it God has not given you the spirit of fear and brother Miguel there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus not going to be but you are now in Christ you are are now sons and neither will there be con condemnation for you which have received the re the word shall not come into condemnation you've already passed from Death onto life you've been loosed by the perfect blood and because it's a perfect blood it's a perfect loosening so why who could condemn you who is he that condemneth this bride who is he that condemneth amen this this Blood Bought Born Again bride of Jesus Christ and mean but the truth sets you free brother Austin the truth declares that you are not under condemnation you are not under fear and mean and the truth is greater than your mind battle the truth is greater than your lie the truth sets you free the truth declares who you really are your identity lays in this word who you were before the foundation of the world Amen that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about a freedom that comes from this truth amen you don't have to be bound in in in in those dark cages uhh the devil tries to bring those traps they try to get you into some dark places but don't give place to the devil there was a woman in brother Brandon's meetings and uh uh the quote I have the quote in there but he said there was a burning in her press there was a burning he said what is that he said that's a devil trying to get in there that's a demon trying to get in it was a burning sensation and he identified it as a demon trying to get in and it amazed me because he said trying to get in it wasn't in and it wasn't just out but it was trying to get in but then in another quote he talks about the holy ghost moving through the building that that that warm filling and and just paraphrasing uh but it's there he talked about he said that's the Holy Ghost trying to get in you see don't give place to the devil it matters who you let in you got a choice that you don't have to you can re resist the devil and he'll flee from you and let almighty God come in and then you can move forward then you can climb into your inheritance you see you were always meant to be a son but you got caged up but you can return at the sound of the Jubilee trumpet which declares that you are free and because you are a son you hear that trumpet and you realize I don't have to stay under that yoke of fear or condemnation you can go from Waring with it to rejoicing you maybe used to be a slave but now that birth changed you from a servant to a son the birth made the difference and now the devil cannot get to you I mean brother Brandon would even say since then uh talking about that Taskmaster he said he's bluffed me lots of times but he's not been able to touch me since because he's just a bluff is that I can hear his whip cracking and popping and so forth but it don't do no good because he can't get me amen and sometimes we forget that sometimes we think that when we become a Christian that all that will go away and then you hear that whip snap and you gra you go right back to that slavery and you think that's where you belong but you realize that it's different now because now he can't get you the Goodman of the house is standing at the door and you're sealed in and the devil's sealed out and you spend so much time waiting for a door to close on you you go through prayer lines and you're just waiting you're just waiting for the preacher to tell you that that you're going to hell and and discern you and tell you that you're full of devils and you're never going to make it all your life you're walking in condemnation waiting for that door to close but it's a lie and you don't have to live under that lie Amen brother Brandon would say uh we are Sons he said because you're born again and you let the devil kick you around like a football stand on your ground I mean you don't have to stay under that amen I like this when he said a the devil can Hell and Hell can keep me from Raising ain't a door he could shut in my face at that morning the seals have been broken hallelujah amen it was there all the time and when you find this message you can take off every other garment and put on the Garment of of this message brother kby you can take off that Garment of fear you can take off that Garment of condemnation you can take off that Garment of of false Doctrine and you can put on the Garment of this message but you can't be married to two at the same time you've got to divorce that old garment amen and God has given us a liberty he said I'll give you the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness I'll give you Beauty for Ashes he didn't say in addition in addition to I'll give you Beauty instead of Ashes I'll give you the oil of Joy instead of mourning you got to kill that old thing take off that Garment of heaviness take off that Garment of morning and put on the Garment of this message which has given you your Liberty amen you can you can you see past it you see when you're in a situation for me anyway it's so easy to walk in the wrong thing and look back and think why did I do that hindsight is 2 20 as they say it's you can walk in fear for so long and then look back and say why did I fear and brother Brandon say one day on the other side of Eden will get back and say why did I fear look at the joy I missed but when you're in the middle of it sometimes it's hard to do that but you got to be able to look past it brother Brandon when he disobeyed the Lord on his Africa trip the Lord is telling him to do a certain thing stay in Johannesburg and do a certain thing but there was a whole host of men persuading them a different way and me and he knew what was right he knew in fact he he come to the point where he grabbed Locust leaves off the tree and threw them on their feet and said okay but we'll face trouble the whole way and they did they went through trouble they went through storms and situations and and and it was a horrible time until brother brandom even contracted an amoeba he got so sick he couldn't hold meetings he was sick he they diagnosed him that that if it got to his brain or his heart different things that he would be dead within I think it was 10 hours and here he was was laying on the bed thinking my I've disobeyed the Lord Lord would the Lord would just turn his back on him wouldn't even wouldn't even communicate with him like he like he used to think what is of my future what is of my meetings what's going to happen I disobeyed the Lord what's my future going to look like and he went through this for long long times but one time the Lord visited him in his room and he come he said as you've been thinking on this about your future and he took that stack of look like typewriter paper and threw it up he said your future is clear here here he was brother brand and then he visited him five times in one setting said he usually only come once but here he come five times which to me I thought it was a pretty significant number but he said your future is clear and that am meba will be gone and he began to discuss him about his meetings and different things but but there was a God he was a prophet that disobeyed the Lord he' walked in the permissive will but the Lord would not take his life but there was a Grace that said your future is clear and I I I just think of my brother Brandon talks about Sarah as we begin to close he said remember when Sarah first heard that man which she is a type of the church when she heard that scene that take place to Abraham she actually laughed about it in her heart and she disbelieved and doubted it ever being so is that right at that time God would have rubbed her name off is that right but he couldn't she's part of Abraham they're one and he said and if you've really not been excited not worked up in Emotion not got some church Creed but really receive the Holy Ghost and you're really part of Christ and still a little skeptic in your mind God will not shove you off from that because he can't you're a part of Christ he will bring you to the truth my what a Grace Sarah should have been rubbed off I mean she should have died under that law but there was another Covenant she was part of Abraham and almighty God could see farther than that he could see farther than her mistakes and see I'm going to bring forth my seed to her womb I'm going to bring forth my seed in God look at you before the foundation of the world he saw your weaknesses he saw your mistakes he saw your failures and your faults but he still chose you why did he choose you he could look farther he had the ability to look past he had the ability to see past mistakes and failures and see but they'll have a desire for this message they'll have a desire for a jubilee have a desire to fly amongst the Eagles and so I look past that I'll look farther than that and I'll put their names on the LSB of life and call them to be a part of this inheritance call them to be a part of this Jubilee maybe you didn't even always know if this message was right maybe there's been times where you said things that you should have never said but because you were a part of Abraham because you were a part of almighty God he could look farther than that and the Grace Covenant could keep you when the many have walked away from this message many fell way to disbelief why are you still here because there was a hand on your life that could look farther than your mistakes farther than your questions and plant a seed in your life God got to you brother Josh before that lying Spirit could ever get to you and he predestinated you and your spiritual womb was already sealed before the foundation of the world and he slit that wedding band of unmerited predestinated Grace on your finger and you cannot fall away because you're a part of Abraham I'm thankful for a prophet that could see farther he could get above the clouds he said I can see where denominations are going I can see where the bride is going I can see I can see because he was a prophet he was an eagle he was a Seer and he could even go so far beyond the curtain of time that he could see 90-year-old converts were young again his horse Prince was there his dog Fritz was there as the musicians come he could see farther he was always scared to death because he think my I'm just going to be a spirit floating out and that was only as far as he could see for quite some time but one day the Lord let him see farther than that and said you don't want to miss this it's the greatest thing everyone's the the same age you can go up and hug your sister and it's just there's just none of that Humanity there it's glorious it's glorious don't miss it I'm going to fight I'm going to press the battle man but don't miss it you say what about my future you see there is a hell there is a hell for The Sinner there is a hell for for the wicked but brother Brandon said but he said the wicked shall be cast into Hell and Hell into the Lake of Fire separated from God what a terrible thing that will be but with the righteous it shall not be so they don't have to fear they have been redeemed by God they are in his bosdm they are the Overcomers and who is he that overcometh he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ why will this overcome this believer escape and go into the Realms of eternal life and Bliss because Jesus paid a price to Ransom us from sin he filled the gap of Separation we who which are far off are now made nigh by the blood and will never come into condemnation they will never be in that Lake of Fire they can never be lost for he will he will lose none of them brother Caleb not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except Jesus where Jesus is they say what's my future as a bride brother Isaac your future is clear your future is wherever Jesus is there I will be also why because this Spirit of Truth was a God and he didn't just reveal these Mysteries but he showed us things to come he said if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you onto myself that where I am there you may be also he said when Jesus prayed brother Bram said Jesus only asked for one thing and his prayer to us the father you know what that was he said that where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship and he's gone to prepare a place for us he's gone to prepare a place where the River of Life flows through the homes amen where the tree of life is planted in every yard what is it the spirit of Truth has told us of things to come and he's declared onto us that oh little pride you're free indeed this is your future you're you're going through a hard time now you may be in a battle now you may be facing sickness now but I can see farther than that there's a future home there's a millennium but now can you see farther than that can you lay down your natural eyesight and look through the the the the the film of this message and see who you are one time the sister had a dream she had a dream that she was walking in White Sands but there was black clouds all over her and and she said my sent him into a nervousness what's wrong what's wrong and I think it was about a year her and some some of her family even were under this nervousness and brother brandom began to talk to her he said no sister the white sand show that you're walking in Purity and righteousness it's just black clouds it's just the nervousness that took a hold of you it's a lie but the true stuff sets you free you see from that moment she would never have to walk under it again and how long are you going to walk under a lie brother Brandon would come in contact with people all the time thinking they had send away the day of Grace and all he would have to do is say no the very fact that you're you're hunger and shows that you haven't and they could walk under a lie for so long but there come a time where they come in contact with that Spirit of Truth and it set them free it's the truth that set you free amen and and my heart maybe there's a that that an eagle in a cage breaks my heart to be in a cage of confusion and to know I I've been there a little bit knowing thinking you know the bride is free and I I want to be a part of it so bad I want to be a part of this Rapture so bad I want to be a part of this Millennium and future home so bad I know it's real I know it's real but but is it for me I just don't know do I have the Holy Ghost am I going to make it you living in a cage of confusion amen but I I know amen that God is not the author of confusion you don't have to be confused conf used about this message you don't have to be confused on whether or not you have the Holy Ghost there is a guide there is a spirit of truth that can show you he can lead you into the truth you can know that you know that you know that you're going to make it that your future is clear that you're full of the Holy Ghost that you're a part of this Millennium and future home that you're under a Grace Covenant that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I believe that Spirit of Truth can set you free free amen could we stand brother wend if you'd come God bless you amen he which the son has made free is free indeed a child of God you unravel me with a [Music] melody you surround me with a [Music] song of deliverance from my enemies till all my fears are gone I'm no longer a Slave To Fear thank you Lord I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to

child of God I'm no longer slave to Fe I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I like what brother Brandon said he said you were helpless caged as that eagle said you're just as helpless as can be unless somebody would come by and open that cage to let you out he said Jesus Christ did that in calling you he opened the cage to let you out and when you feel that call in your heart calling you to a higher plane calling you out of that cage amen that very very calling open the cage as you could walk out amen do you love him tonight God hallelujah I'm free I'm free
