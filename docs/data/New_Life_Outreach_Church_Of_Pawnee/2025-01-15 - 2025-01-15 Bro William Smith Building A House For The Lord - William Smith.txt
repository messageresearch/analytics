but if we can open our Bibles to acts 7 we're going to go to acts 7 and then we're going and go to Ephesians 2 and thank you Minister uh the the the piano yeah there you go thank you I still get nervous uh but uh it's we have our sister back home and sister uh we've been doing it for by herself we have another sister there sister Hannah that started playing the guitar and and so uh so I've been trying to make sure I say sisters instead of sister and uh cuz it's it's without that and a song leader it's hard for a preacher all right and uh and so I want you all to know them young men right there and that sister that plays that piano you should be praying for them it's a gift and we got to have that gift because that's what changed ches that atmosphere so that you and I can get into that atmosphere and worship Our God and I really do appreciate each and every one of you and it was good to hear Brother Kobe sing dece me but here in Acts 2 I mean acts 7 excuse me in 47 he goes but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in Temple made with hands as said the prophets Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will eild me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest if we go to Ephesians 2 and9 I started another series there and and we're taking the whole message of this statue of a perfect man and just breaking it down in different ways of how brother brandham brought it out and we know that that statue of a perfect man we know that that's Christ but in this Christ wants a body all right and so here in Ephesians 2 and9 it says now therefore ye are no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growing unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom we also are built together for inhabitant of God through the spirit praise the Lord you may be seated I would like to minister just for a little while building a house for the Lord okay all right building a house for the Lord here in statue of a perfect man brother Bron was saying he was now God or the Bible says here that Stephen spoke of Solomon building a temple and the most high don't dwell in the temples made with hands for Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol and where is the place of my rest but a body hast thou prepared me you can turn me down if I need and where is the place of my rest but body H has thou prepared me he said amen there you are a body has has thou prepared me God dwells in a statue of a man reflecting himself unto that being now when he was when I read this I was thinking how can I build a house for the Lord yes because the prophet of God says he's already done it yeah so what is our job to do today what are we got to do to prepare a house that God can have rest in okay okay this flesh was born in sin shape of iniquity yes sir it was going to hail if something didn't come to redeem it God in his mind prepared you to be Sons and Daughters of God but he not only designs you to be that he designed you to be a house so the Lord can come and live in sure yes sir individually but this individually is more than just Sons and Daughters of God it takes the body of Christ to be the body that God's going to dwell in you are material in the thinking of God every one of you has gifts in the body yes my heart is a gift my kidneys are a gift if my kidneys are sick the body's sick and so this house has to be prepared but before this house can be prepared it has to be on the right foundation and with the right foundation then you take the word of God the materials and build God a house in the gra what we what he's done you and I do so he goes a body has thou prepared me God dwells in a stature of a man reflecting himself in the being perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting okay so don't let the devil ever tell you that you don't have nothing in you to be Christians God created you to be Christians he created you to be Sons and Daughters of God it doesn't matter how you came to this earth he's got something downside of your heart it's called a soul and that soul is going to prepare a place that God can dwell in Hallelujah so where is God God came off his throne right he came into a body he was promised that he was going to be a redeemer he came to the Earth in a little body you were preach on Christmas too I guess on you were the stinking stable yeah Christ come to a stable that was stinking with cows and horses and all kinds of things you were born and shaping of iniquity a bunch of lies and junk of this world unbelief but he didn't let that stop him to come down into your heart and to make you know that who you are today God himself come down to manifest himself in you you should be sitting in your seat saying God is the one the reason why I'm sitting here today is because of him and if we can realize that the reason why we're breathing this evening is because you are in the his Redemption plan and he's broken word through you hallelujah hallelujah now who's the statue of a perfect man Christ has been here and gone yeah yeah come on yes yeah he says I got to go back to my father y but I will send you the comforter and that comforter has to go somewhere it's just not on the space of the time that's why the Bible says you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and if they have any sins they are [Music] forgiven exactly what Jesus did Lazarus come forth he had to come forth now where is he at statue of a perfect man Hallelujah he's in you and if you don't believe that you need to find an altar somewhere and find God because the Bible clarifies that he works only through the body I might be the toe but one of you might be the brain you might be the heart yeah but without that toe you're going to walk funny and if your heart ain't working right your blood ain't going to go like where it needs to go your lungs are going to start failing your everything's going to start failing if the heart ain't pumping but when I'm hurt first thing I do I go find something to make it feel better the only thing that's going to make the church feel better is God himself and we cry upon him he's the one that's all D to take care of you and I hallelujah hallelujah because why bless the word says so praise be to God a foundation is what we need to start our house this Foundation has been made go in you can go to Genesis and follow the history everything in Genesis all the way down to Malachi 4 Was preparing Christ to come everything in the Old Testament was dentifying that little Ruth needed to be redeemed and it had to be a close relative to redeem her Israel without you can't be completed because the Bible says God has a bride amen and boas had his eyes upon a lady and he wanted her but he knew that there was a closer uh kin so he had to go to the elders and when he got to the elders because he knew the nature of that Kinsman he was selfish he wanted everything for his glory and if it wasn't going to be glory he didn't want nothing a part of it but so he started out Naomi she's back oh she is isn't she she needs a well I'll redeem her he got him he hooked him because Boaz knew that he was a stiff neck legalistic Jew no Grace he had his his own thinking and he goes to redeem her you have to redeem Ruth you've got to give her a portion of your wealth yeah you've got to give him a give her a portion of your inheritance yeah and he says I don't want her you take her yeah and Boaz stood there in the midst of the elders and says this day you are witnesses and he kicks off the shoe and throws it to him and says I redeem her okay and I will fulfill the kinsman redeemer yeah praise the Lord in the Old Testament was lining up who Christ was right from Matthew to Revelation it's Christ Building a Church yeah and in this church there was many members bodies and he had to start right there before he can build the house we know that contractors have to go out and get all the material the prophet of God saying they had to go out and get these materials they had to go get the wood they had to go get these things he had to prepare but see he couldn't get the material he couldn't get anything unless he has the blueprints all right the blueprints was going to tell him exactly what they going to need for that house that beautiful house on the back page couldn't do nothing until that first page was taken care of first the itemizer of all the material and when he got that all figured out then he started digging ditches to put a foundation in before he could build a house that's what the prophet of God come for he was a master builder he was anointed to come this age and bring you back to the material that's going to give you a house so he can live in I want you to find some place that you can build a foundation of something will take you there besides Jesus Christ I want you to find something that'll give you that much satisfaction you find it and then come tell me I've done everything brother Brown said I was big enough to do and some things I wasn't big enough to do I've tried but I have have never found nothing yet that's ever touched the place of the lifegiving flow of the power of God the holy spir the holy ghost coming down upon me brother that night the anchor my soul in his Everlasting salvation there is nothing out there that will ever satisfy you Church except Christ we can act all kinds of funny we can walk in the graveyard at night and whistle but you're still scared but in Christ you don't have to worry no more because he's going to give you Eternal rest on Earth today you don't have to wait till you get there but the manifestation of God is going to be in a bride and this bride is going to produce Jesus the word for this hour that Royal Seed of Abraham came out through a gentile bride and she has everything she needs in her now hallelujah it's on the property you just got to go out there with your blueprint and pick up the right stuff you go out there and pick up and say okay I'm ready to go and the material is still over there you're not going to build a house yeah because the first thing you should have grabbed was a shovel and started making ditches all right to make a foundation but when you realize that your foundation is built on the word that's your foundation and when you realize it that's the word that you could build your house on there's not a devil in hell they can take it away from you because that has been proven to be the foundation that God has built for you and I to conquer every devil everything that comes your way you got it just on that Foundation Hallelujah bless the Lord and so now he's telling them let me please show me but then he goes on and he goes this eternal Sal ation it's peace like a river peace like a Eternal salvation it's peace like a river peace like a river oh church he keeps repeating this now I repeated one more more than I should have but I did because it is it feels that way to me have you just been out there one day and God just dealing with your hearts maybe your sisters are washing dishes and things and all of a sudden the presence of God just comes down and you just oh everything is fading away when the storms are coming you should have rest knowing that you're in the harms of God that he's going to take you through it stop looking out here the circumstances look back and see the footprint that Jesus has got you in his arms and he's walking you through that trial he's walking you through those things keep your eyes on the blueprint because storms do come we have to stop building and we got to go through these storms until the storm goes but a man or a daughter of God is not going to sit home and wait till the storm goes they're going to find something to do to be ready to start building again and so now peace like a river Something Happens live or die what difference does it make we're going to be in his presence turn back to a young man and woman living that way forever and forever eternity so what have we got to worry about there's no perfect there's no perfect happens outside of that that's why it's important to read your book it's important to you young people to get into your Bible and read and find out the promises of God but brother William I read it I just don't understand come to church be sincere to God say God this blueprint I just don't understand it can you bring somebody some architector to come and tell me how to build my house cuz I don't understand and he'll send you a preacher that understands the blueprint all right and he'll come in and he'll open it up and say this is what you're doing wrong this is what you need to be doing you're taking the wrong tools to do the job with screw drivers are not going to put a nail in but this mortified nail gun that's hooked to that air compressor will do the job for you you don't have to just swing a hammer anymore you can grab that air compressor by the hose and go click it into a this little thing that has a handle on with a trigger on it and go little Spanish guys up them roofs Lord have mercy that'd be done already but see God has labors to do the right job and he has called you to build him a house Hallelujah he's got the material laying right there GL only thing we got to do is get into the blueprint and find out how to build a house and if you don't understand come to church say Mr architector Pastor I'm stumped I'm having a hard time with this and watch the great master builder will come down and say hey through the anointing and tell you exactly to Build That Wall hallelujah hallelujah cuz why he's peace like a river amen first he's it's his way second it's the truth the third it's the light fourth it's the only Eternal found found foundation and fifth he's the only Eternal happiness and joy six he's the only lasting achievement he is praise be to God why yes he's been proven he's been proven yes he's been up in the high mountains and he was tempted and he used what the foundation word it is written it is written we have the right to use the same words against the enemy amen he has to come off your foundation what is that foundation with a bunch of snow on it's nothing you don't go home for 4 days until it comes off you go out there with big shovels and you scrape that devil right off your foundation it takes work it takes prayer it takes Agony it takes these things to make you get to a place because when the foundation is built and you start putting walls up you're saying hey I can see something here remember when we started this it was nothing but five acres with a bunch of nonsense on it a broken down house snakes yes a bunch of rats everything you can imagine was in it yeah but we had a vision yeah and you started cleaning and you started taking things down you started seeing something come away from this piece of property that wasn't belonging there because it was given to you it's your inheritance it's yours to build a house of God up on it and you worked on Mondays you worked on Tuesdays but you didn't stop you came to here and you started working them evenings and them evenings and the sisters prepared food for us and what happened all the worldly stuff was off all the dead trees were gone and God sent a backo operator and he started digging ditches glory and we're on a foundation and it's holy because of work yeah they saw Abraham's Faith by his Works Abraham saw the word and he had faith that he was going to have a baby yes but his faith proved what he believed in you guys believe that we're going to have a church now we never believe that we was going to have it in one year but we did it or you guys did it I was all Ed up but God is faithful God is here to make you perfect through the blood he sheds blood on you God can't see you except sees Jesus hallelujah it's not your little mistakes that you make he sees it's because the blood's already covered you from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head he's in love with you amen I love it when he sees you he just gets embarrassing she loves me how was it nobody but you make him somebody because you worship him you love him and the reason why you love him is because you're starting to see the fruits of the spirit living in you and more you love him the more he's going to give to you and before long it's going to fall on other people and when that happens you're fulfilling scripture the word of God through your life because now he has got a place to live in that he can produce the word through your lips okay this sinful body he's slapping the devil in the face cuz he thought you had you at Birth but Christ come well Glory through a spoken word and spoke the seed in a virgin born child of God and she produced Christ through her womb God was produced through spoken word through a body so that he can feel your trials all right through your pain boys you know he had to go to church too but he likeed going to church cuz he knew his father was don't you like bragging about your daddy he's cool a he you can look back and say man my daddy got muscles you guys can look and say my daddy he's got the looks you can look up daddy up there and say wooo he's got the big truck what is it that's your daddy you're proud of your daddy even if he gives you a good old spank and you still love him don't talk about my daddy it's because there's a love affair there and more we get in the word we find out how much Jesus loves us and it's so so much easier to serve a God that you love it's not because you have to it's because you want [Music] to praise the Lord amen hallelujah and so here he goes I like this he say if a contractor laid out a plan for his men to build a house such and such way and each man ignored the blueprint that they build the house according to their way they could thought each man should build it the kind of a a house it would look like what would it look like without blueprints we'd be taking a lot of walls out something wouldn't fit we be buying more material cuz all that material that you put up has to come back out how many times do we forget the blueprint and we say oh we're Christians I know what to do and we go on and we do this and do that and we have to go oh man we got to go tear this house back down stick with the word and you'll have complete rest quit thinking so hard we've got to get into Unity more than anything that the church need is to get into the unity of the word because the unity brings other people into that unity and if we got Unity because if you have all the seals in you and you understand them all you can still split hell wide open but when you have the unity of the word laying down into your heart is because now you are doing exactly what God wants you to be and you have Heaven backing you up little police officers when you're tired of the devil say stop right there Devil he's got to stop not because of you it's because of who you belong to when he recognizes that Faith immediately cancer starts dying sicknesses start dying you young people quit thinking that nobody loves you because there's people out there that don't love you they don't love me so I stay away from them I go to the one that died for me the one that gave me a family to live with to come back to Pony America and be here and knowing that you guys love us amen we might not get to see each other very often but every once in a while I get a text from one of you I get almost a text almost every Sunday through brother wendle praying for for me you don't know what that does for a man is starting out these young people are starting out to be Christians loving God we should be encouraging them go and help them build the house show them an easier way to build it but stay with the blueprint amen amen praise be to God but these guys they they went out and built this it'll be a crazy house but see if we go according to the blueprint then you'll be in the rest because he'll be living in you then praise the Lord second Peter 1 and two it says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and our Jesus Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this he might be partakers of a divine nature what is this nature it's the Holy Ghost the word being planted into you changing your old nature out and putting him there because my Bible says when a woman and man gets married they're one when we get married to the word Jesus Christ we're one so the word is who now it's you from the foundation down deep in the ground way deep down there all the way from there to the last single upon that house it's a house it's his property yes that house is holding the master and whatever you say you bind from Heaven it'll be bound in heaven if you loosen it from Heaven it'll be loosened from Heaven you bind it on the earth it'll be bound but if you loosen it it'll be loose through your lips your Authority because now you are M Jesus Christ I got a quote with brother man say that's where we got to get to to realize that you call her Jesus Christ the word the bride how many of you men will let your wife go to the store and you're with her and some guy come up and start trying to talk to her first thing you do is hey buddy how you doing hey let me show you this um this stick over here she didn't say I do to you you don't have her ring on your ring on her finger it's mine stay away from her hello if you'll stay in God's business you won't even have to tell the devil to come out of your headache that's right because he's going to say okay devil that's enough get out and he'll have to leave why are we wrestling about these [Music] things we need to get into the Altar and cry out to God and get every wor word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God every promise in the book is mine and stand there and say devil no more I am through with you devil and March to your possessions that he given you for this body and then he goes on and he says having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust here's your materials come on now and he says here he say besides this giving all diligence adding to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity this is the framework of the house faith is the foundation each one of these are the layers of each one of this house until the Capstone of Love Comes upon it and it's shingled over it's sealed no storm can get in oh church we got to get the place and build this house so the Capstone can come falling down upon it and the storms of life can't ever hurt it no more oh it'll beat it up a little bit on the outside but you open your garage door and you grab a little bit of tools and you go out there and you fix it maintaining it right some of us have built the house but you're letting it fall apart because you got too much nonsense in your brains thinking well I've been a Christian for 50 years I can sit back and relax and watch your house fall apart all right but it takes a maintaining amen that's right to keep it up you've got to get out of the bed and fight what's yours from The Winds of the world okay because it'll batter us because life is hard sometimes but sometimes we got to sit back and have a little patience say all right we got to take care of it this way and the way to take care of this situation is by the word and watch the correction happens and it won't cost you a dime little heartache but it ain't going to cost you a dime so all these millionaires you won't have to worry about it because all the millions and dollars is going to burn so I'd rather put my treasures in him because if I'm in him he said he'll be in me the hope of glory will be in me and if he's in me I'm a conqueror in Christ Jesus for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of of our Lord Jesus Christ woo 1 Corinthians 3 and 10 it says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another buth thereof yeah but let every man take heed how to buth thereof upon for other foundations can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus [Music] Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold and silver and precious stones wood and Haze stubble their Men's Work shall be made manifest for they for the day shall declare it because if because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work in what sort it is if any man work abide which is hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but himself shall be saved yet so as five fire oh my let's St let's stick with the blueprints here storms are raging but you got it in you Hallelujah when a carpenter goes to build a house how does he do it lays Out All the lumber first he's got in his mind just what he going to build God had before the world was ever had to speak of life on it he had everybody laying right there did you hear me he had everybody every one of you he's talking to Church laying right there if it didn't where did it come from that's the reason he was twisted it and rolled it and turned it he would have it to the Sun this way and make potash and turn it back this way and the other ones he to make it a little faster and he just kept boiling it out here until he created Earth he created the heavens and he created all the stars he created the sun he created the moon those are types of the of of Jesus Christ and the bride right there what was he doing he was making a paradise for you and me to live in total rest a body that he can come down to and visit anytime he wants toless complete rest he turned it back th this way he did make these things for one purpose and that is to show his glory glory to you so that you can see that all these things he created for you was nothing compare to when he created you because he didn't marry that he's marrying you you ladies look across and see your little little hubby he married you husbands look across see what you married I told the church back home the greatest thing side salvation brother Brown said it was your wife how many can walk out this door tonight with her leave in her here and live with yourself you guys would be get in about a week some of you burn water some likes the microwave cook something supposed to be 20 seconds 3 minutes boom thank God for our wives huh Hallelujah that was free what we got to fear about we should be the freest and happiest people people there is anywhere we don't have to guess about it God in our mix and proves it that's right it's according to his word and his Spirit now let's take it our bodies before there was even Earth was finished Beyond form our bodies that were lay living in right now was laying on that Earth Earth in potash and so forth when he created the Earth you were there and after the Earth had been shaped and all of it lay in there just a breach desert never had life on it never was nothing called life but all the materials was laying there to make a body and I can hear God say to the great Holy Spirit go forth now and Brew Over the Earth and now we have to use imagination here as we make a drama the great Holy Spirit went forth spread forth its wings over the Earth and begin to bre Brew for a purpose and that was to bring forth something to project what God was all right I want to run what was he projecting you because the heaven of Earth was coming down into you to perform all miracles show me any in the Bible where God himself made a made a miracle without a human body he brought the pillar of [Music] fire but it took a person to be a walking Bible to prove that that light was there because some of us didn't get to see it but it had to be inspired by the Holy Spirit into you so that you could believe so that's why he had to create a soul that was from him that when it was energized it was going to produce the word wow manifested the Holy Spirit through you yes building a house for God is the greatest thing you could ever do and that is to get rid of all the junk the love of the world out of us because this thing's sticky this is so sticky it's just like those those um I can't remember the bushes but you walk by them and them them arms would just run out there and grab a whole to you and snag to you you guys know what I'm talking about and I mean they stickers they just grab a whole Tu and more you pull the more it gets on you but see how to get rid of that is you get a torch with a bunch of butane and you light that torch up and you go and you burn it all the way to the ground then you get your tractor and you scrape it off and you just keep on going until it's out of your distance so you got to take this flesh and burn it by the word of God so it burns the world out of us and that's why it's so important to cry out to God and let God come in there and burn everything that Satan has done at the beginning out of you cleanse you let him scrape you a little bit clean you up you're going to look a lot better when this five acres cleaned off you can start from that end or start to that end and drive by this is the Prest building on this road why because it was men and women that wanted to to do their very best to build a house of God so they can come and worship the Lord so what about our own flesh shouldn't we start taking care of it a little bit more right praise the Lord all right a house the foundation is first what is the foundation Christianity faith in the word of God the foundation then you begin to grow then start you begin to add to that Foundation now building a house I'm almost through now building a house you put your uprights and everything else the contractor here could tell us all about it but brother Ram goes on and goes he could he could teach you how to build a house but see but I going to tell you how to build a spiritual house where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself he wants you to reflect reflecting rather he said of his being and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the Son of God now we're supposed to do his work he said he said he that believeth on me St John 14:7 he that believeth on me the works that I shall do also you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ more you put him in you the more you're going to reflect the love more you put into you you're going to reflect that Foundation that was built you're going to reflect the virtue you're going to reflect all all these attributes that God prepared for you to be because he was the great Foundation he was every one of these words that I just read a little while ago that you can have in your house this fleshly body here but see it's more than just your flesh Church remember you are a part of a church you are a part of a body that members come to to come to make one body called The Bride spiritually that's why we can't look at one another and see our faults when you see a brother in The Fault you lift him up but you don't know what he's done to me what' you do to God back in your 20s drinking and cussing and storming around and fighting and drinking and all kinds of wh Ming and things like that you're slapping him in the face every time we do something like that we're selfish if we don't have the love of God in us we don't have these attributes we need to find an altar and get these attributes in our house quickly tear it down start over build this house according to the blueprint and you will be a powerful Church the B says amen then after we lay the foundation secondly we add to that Foundation we add to the house Faith Peter said here add to your first you have faith then you add virtue then you add knowledge then you add Temperance then you add patience then you add godliness then you add brotherly kind then you you add charity house that you are building is it's this is your materials that you need to build your house very simple just got to be in prayer you know prayer is like studying do you know that I know I just blew your way because more you do it the more you want to do it because you're going to see results the more you read the Bible more results you're going to get the more you die out and let the word of God flow through you you're going to walk through this church and somebody is going to get touched Lord if you come in the church this kid right here is looking at me right now going what is he a problem because it brings a spirit in and so the people are looking at that Spirit instead of hearing from the master table but if you walk [Music] in GL Hallelujah man got Smiles on their faces it's not that hard prepare yourself before you come to the house of God and watch God use your gift to bless your friends Lord I told the church on Sunday I said brother BR made a comment he goes when you come under the head ship of the Holy Spirit you don't have no enemies you don't have no enemies because love conquers all of it you're looking at Somebody That Jesus Christ died for GL to God how can he be your enemy we cannot look at the people in California that all that are getting the Judgment Hallelujah God's coming soon you should be on your prayer borns asking God to save their souls lord they're my brother my [Applause] sister we get so caught up that we're somebody we ain't nothing but a bunch of sticks that can burn but if we have those virtues laying in this house the heavenly father is going to be there and we are going to help somebody Hallelujah are you going to build God a house tonight
