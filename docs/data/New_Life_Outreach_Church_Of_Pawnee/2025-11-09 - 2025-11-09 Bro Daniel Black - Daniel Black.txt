This is [singing] the moving day for us to move a little closer [music and singing] where the streams are flowing. Move on, brother. [singing] Move on. [music] Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, you're getting up there when it's in your mind when the preacher says that the young people stand, you start to move a little bit. And if you get to where I'm at, you don't move much more because your kids are no longer the young people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I remember when I first got saved, I was 19 years old. You know, most of you know brother David Gadman. [music] You really He's known all over the place. He's one that was befriended me for three or four years. Kept telling me, "You had to come to church. When you come to church," I said, "Oh, someday, David." I used to tell [music] him, "David, we were both the same age, hung out together." I used to tell him, "David, you going to tell you something? If I were getting saved, you I always love my rock and roll. You ain't taking [music] it from me." But you know what? God has a different plan. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And he takes when I You try to do it on your own and throw the rock and roll out. I tried that too. I'm going to listen to Christian music. That don't work either. &gt;&gt; When he does it, &gt;&gt; he does it right. &gt;&gt; Now, now we have I was as a young [music] man 19 years old when I gave my life to the Lord. And [music] now I've been married for almost 43 years, have four children, grown. The youngest, today's Matthew's, my son [music] Matthew's birthday. He's 32. So when your youngest is 32, you're like, "No, I'm not young people anymore, but I'm heading to it." I like what brother Clark used to say years ago. Said, "If the Lord carries, I'm closer." Look at young people say, [music] "Lord Terry, I'm closer to it than you are because we go long by the way of the grave." &gt;&gt; You just pray for us and good to be here today and thank God for what he's done. &gt;&gt; We mess this up. Just blame it on me. You know my [music and singing] knees, all that's unspoken. You hold the pieces of all that's [singing and music] been broken. Even when a [singing] meloyy won't [music] come, even when my words are not [singing and music] enough, you will be my song. You will [music and singing] be my praise. You will be my voice when I'm lost for words to say. [music] You [singing] will be my strength. You will lift me up. &gt;&gt; You will be my portion [music and singing] and my redeeing love. You will [singing] be my [music] soul. &gt;&gt; Before I [music] call, I know you'll [singing] hear me. When [music] hope is [singing] gone, still you are near me. Even when [music and singing] the answer is delayed, [music] even through the darkness, [singing] I will sing. &gt;&gt; You will [music] be my song. You will be my praise. You will be [music and singing] my voice. When I'm lost for words to say, you will be my strength. You will lift [singing] me up. [music] &gt;&gt; You will be my portion [singing] and my redeeing love. You will [music] be my soul. [music] &gt;&gt; Before I call, I know you'll hear [singing and music] me. When hope is gone, still you [music and singing] are near me. Even when the answer is delayed, [music] even through the darkness, I will [singing] sing. &gt;&gt; You will be [music] my song. &gt;&gt; You will be my praise. You will [music] be my [singing] voice when I'm lost words to say. [music] &gt;&gt; You will be my strength. You will [singing] lift me [music] up. You will be my portion and my [singing and music] redeeming love. You will be my song. You [singing] will be my praise. You will be my voice when I'm lost for words to say. You will be my [music] strength. You will lift me up. [applause] You will be [singing] my portion. in my [music] redeeming love. You will [singing] be my soul. Oh, [music] Praise the Lord.

[music] And if we come with a heart that is hungry and we're pulling on the word of the Lord, God can move that man totally out of himself, off his notes and everything to come and meet your need.

If I start picking out, I won't we'll just be here to the end of the service. So, I just want to say God bless to every one of you. I kind of a privilege to be among you today. [music] Um I just love the Lord. I I really do. And uh going to let our musicians be seated if you'd like to. And really appreciate the songs that we heard today. And uh I sure didn't expect to see the Wheeler family today. God bless you guys. It's good to see you. I said I wasn't going to do it and I did it, didn't I? [laughter] I just uh well, human frailty, I guess, you know. But I just want to say that I love every one of you. I just I I truly love the Lord. And I believe that if you'll come expecting today, the Lord will go meet you right on your eyeball level and meet you with what you have need of today. Uh I want to speak to you on a thought this morning. called to cross over. Called to cross over. And uh St. John chapter 5:es 30 through32. And uh just want to read this in the name of the Lord and pray that he'll help me to get myself out of the way because my kneecaps are about buckling together uh from nervousness, you know. But uh I pray that that'll never go away, you know, that we'll always be nervous in his presence because it's a holy it's a holy place. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John 5:es 30-32 he says I can of mine my own self do nothing &gt;&gt; as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the father which had sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. There is another that beareth witness of me. And I know that the witness which he witnessth of me is true. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we love you. I thank you for your word, Lord. And Lord Jesus, this it is the only thing in this world that will stand, Father. Everything else will pass away, but Lord, your word will always be there, Father. Lord, that's what we want to stand on today. Father, I ask you, Lord, to anchor us to it, Lord. We love you. Be with us now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. You know, Jesus did not come out and just go around telling everybody, "I am the Messiah. I can do works. I can do these things." Uh God confirmed who Jesus was. God was the one that bore witness of who he was. And you know, it's one thing for man to say that God is with him. It's another thing for God to bear witness that he is with the man. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't want to just have a church that has God's name on it. I want God to put his name on me, &gt;&gt; you know. And we on his seal, brother Brennham talked about the seal of approval. When they put a seal on a cart, he said they wouldn't put it on the rail the seal on the cart until everything was right. Sometimes there would be jars moving around and different things and reasons why he couldn't put the cart the seal on. But once he put the seal on, it was sealed to the day of redemption, sealed to its destination. And you know, the people put seals on just about anything today. They'll put, you know, their name on anything because they don't care about the product that they have. They don't value what they're doing. And, you know, that's a representation of whatever that name is. But, you know, God is is so much greater than that. God's not going to just put his name on anything. God takes value in his name. And I believe God takes value in his word. God takes value in his people. And, you know, I believe that God's word is holy. How many you believe that today? You know, I believe that if we would reverence God the way the much as we could reverence God, the more God would come into our midst. You know, people will honor a judge and different things because, you know, when they step into that courtroom, that judge has the authority to cast them into prison. That judge has the authority to do great harm or great things for them. You know, but there's a heavenly judge. There's a great judge that's holier than all. You know, I would that we can walk in the fear of the Lord of acknowledging I am in the presence of a holy God. You know, he's so holy that he told a man one time, "You got to take your shoes off because you're on holy ground." I believe that same God from back then is the same God that's here today. If we will reverence him and reverence his holiness, you know, the most religious people in the world thought God was with them because they held the words of a prophet. How many knows that's true? In St. John 5:es 37-47 it reads and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and you have not his words abiding in you. For whom he hath sent him you believe not. Search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me. and you will not come to me that you may have life. I receive not honor from men, but I know you that you have not the love of God in you. I come in my father's name and you receive me not. If another shall come in his own name, him you will receive. How can you believe that which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor cometh from God only? &gt;&gt; Do not think that I will accuse you to the father. There is one that accuseth you, even Moses in whom you trust. &gt;&gt; For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he wrote of me. But if you believed not his writings, how shall you believe my words? These were a religious people of the day. This is not just some people that were living a dirty life or something like that. These were a people of a reputation in the town, in the city. If they said, "HEY, WHAT ABOUT SO AND SO?" THEY'D SAY, "THAT'S A GOOD MAN. That's a GOOD BROTHER. BUT THIS was a man that was AT FUNERALS. THIS WAS A man that went to weddings. This was a man that kissed the babies. THIS WAS NOT A TERRIBLE PERSON. These were MEN THAT WERE UPRIGHT standing men. And these are men that had a testimony IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THESE ARE MEN IF YOU WERE TO ASK FOR FOR ADVICE. WHO WOULD YOU GO TO TALK TO? I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO THIS GUY BECAUSE THIS IS A GUY THAT'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. BUT YET THESE MEN HAD JESUS CHRIST STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM. BROTHER AND SISTER, THEY WERE HOLDING THE WORDS OF A PROPHET OF MOSES AND SAYING, "I'VE GOT THE TRUTH." BUT THE TRUTH WAS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. BROTHER, I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME WHERE I'M SAYING, "I'VE GOT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IN THE VERY ONE, JESUS CHRIST, STANDING RIGHT IN MY MIDST." AND I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM. &gt;&gt; I WANT HIM TO PUT HIS SEAL ON MY LIFE. NOT ME SAY I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER, BUT GOD SAY THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE BELIEVER. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO. &gt;&gt; YOUR GREATEST [screaming] CALLING YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE IS TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. IT'S NOT TO BE A PREACHER. IT'S NOT TO BE A SINGER. IT'S TO BE A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. [screaming] BECAUSE WHEN YOU HEED TO THAT, YOU JUST SAY, "THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD." [laughter] YOU'RE CLINGING ON TO HIM BECAUSE YOU'RE WALKING WITH HIM. YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM. AND THEN IF GOD WANTS YOU TO DO THOSE THINGS, HE'LL LEAD YOU TO DO IT. BUT DON'T SEEK AFTER THOSE THINGS. SEEK TO FOLLOW THE SHEPHERDS AS SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THERE ARE SO MANY PREACHERS THAT ARE LOST WHEN THAT DAY THE PHARISEES SADDUCEES STANDING RIGHT there lost &gt;&gt; and didn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you when you are anchored with God, &gt;&gt; anchored with your shepherd. I know and who I'm following. &gt;&gt; I want that. I want it so much. &gt;&gt; I want it so much. I don't want to be something that's fake. I want him to be in my midst. You know, I heard a story one time. You were doing a book club. You'd read books about so everybody read the same book and you'd sit in the room and you would talk about your theory of what you think the book means. And everyone had their theories what they thought it mean. And this one man back here says, "Well, I think it means this." And they said, "Well, who are you to say that? I wrote the book." The author standing right in their midst and they got their own opinions and the very one that wrote the book was in their midst and they were trying to criticize him. You don't even know what you're talking about. So, I wrote the book. [applause and cheering] A &gt;&gt; lot of people sitting around the message. I THINK IT MEANS THIS. I THINK IT MEANS THAT. AND the whole time the one that wrote it &gt;&gt; is right in our midst. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, I want that. &gt;&gt; I want it so bad in my home where he is with me where I can say, "The Lord is my shepherd." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These men, these religious men were claiming to hold the words of Moses. And Jesus said, "I won't be the one that accuses you. The very prophet you claim to follow will accuse you." &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Many people say the they would have followed Moses, Elijah, or Jesus back then, but what they do now is what you would do then. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's good. &gt;&gt; So, it behooves us to dig into the scripture and to see who we are and what that we're standing for. And I want to ask you this question and I want you to think about it throughout this service. What are you seeking &gt;&gt; from the honesty of your heart? I want you to think about that. What am I seeking really? Am I seeking healing? Am I seeking a this? Am I seeking that? What really am I seeking? I left my water back there. Is this my water in this cup here? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I get thirsty. You want some? I shouldn't do that. St. John chapter 6:es 26-40. This is a little bit of scripture reading, but please just follow with me and let's see what the I heard a brother say one time, brother Jess Tramble, he said in your when you're in a service, he's you realize there's enemies coming at him while he's preaching the whole time. He said, so try to look through that and see what is this man trying to say to me. What is the message? And so do that this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 6 26-4. Jesus answered him and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor not for the meat with perish, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you, for him hath God the Father sealed." Then said they unto him, "What shall we do that we might work the works of God?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he hath sent." &gt;&gt; They said, "Therefore unto him," What sign shall thou then that we may see and believe thee? What dost thou work? Our fathers did eat mana in the wilderness, as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven." &gt;&gt; For the bread of heaven is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life into the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore, give us this bread. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall hunger, shall never hunger. He that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you that you also seen me and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I come down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; brother and sister, the meat of the father is to do the will of the father. not to try to do different things, but I want to do your will, Father. What is your will for my life? And if I was to ask that across this building of you to write on a piece of paper, how many of you know what the will of your life is? &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's the most important thing in your life is to walk in the will of the Lord. We don't want to just walk in the will of the permissive will, but the perfect will of God. And Jesus said, "This is the meat." How do we do the works of God? He said, "Seek to do the will of the father." How many of you want to see God working in your life? You know how you're going to do it? Seek to be in the will of the father of following his leadership because God wants to lead you. You know, a guide whenever you we need a guide AND A GUIDE, HE don't want to make it to where you can't follow him. THE GUIDE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM AND SO MUCH MORE. THE HOLY SPIRIT WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW. HE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM. HE WANT HE DON'T WANT TO TRIP YOU UP. HE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HIM. BUT YOU SEE, WE HAVE TO SEEK AFTER HIM. BUT THE ENEMY WILL PUT ADVERSARIES AND AND TRIALS AND ALL THESE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE TO COMPLEX YOU TO TO FEEL YOU BEAT DOWN WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT, BROTHER AND SISTER, SEEK TO BE IN THE WILL OF THE FATHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO PAY THIS BILL. &gt;&gt; I NEED THIS HEALING in my family. I NEED THIS TOUCH IN THE LORD. DON'T SEEK FOR THAT. DON'T SEEK FOR THE HEALING. DON'T SEEK FOR THE NEED. SEEK TO BE IN THE WILL OF THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU do that, he'll do that automatically. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said, he says, "And this is the I'm sorry." Scripture says, "And this is the will of the father which hath sent me, that all which hath given me, I will lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day. &gt;&gt; And I want to say it again, brother and sister, seek the will of the father. Whether you are a young person in this room or you are an old person in this room, it don't matter what it is that you are facing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen to these words. Seek the will of the father. what in in this circumstance that I am in God, what is your will in this &gt;&gt; because sometimes his will is not what we want it to be. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's absolutely the opposite of what we want it to be. &gt;&gt; But you know, you want to work in the will, the perfect will of God because God, you know, no prophet, no minister, and no person can do the works of God. You cannot. If I was to walk to brother Window and I said, "Brother Windle, I want you to do this miracle for me." As much as he loves me, he can't do it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he can't. &gt;&gt; The only one that can do it is God. &gt;&gt; Only thing he can do it. SO IT DON'T MATTER WHAT IT IS. We can try, we can preach, we could shout, WE CAN JUMP UP AND DOWN, WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THING. It won't work. Brother Bam talked about how that you have electricity in this room. &gt;&gt; We have enough electricity in this room that we can light the world up. But just screaming and shouting at the electricity, electricity, light up, electricity light up. RIGHT? IF IT'S DARK IN HERE, ELECTRICITY, SPEAK IN TONGUES, ELECTRICITY LIGHT UP. CAUSE THIS ROOM TO LIGHT UP, IT'LL NEVER WORK. &gt;&gt; In the SAME SENSE, IF I NEED TO GET WATER FROM THE DESERT OVER TO THIS OTHER from the water from this oasis, SO TO SPEAK, TO TO THE DESERT, I COULD SCREAM AT IT. I COULD SHOUT AT IT. I COULD SPEAK AT IT. GET THE WATER OVER THERE. GET THE WATER OVER THERE. SPEAK IT. IT'LL NEVER WORK. NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. BUT IF I WILL WORK ACCORDING [screaming] TO THE LAWS OF ELECTRICITY, BROTHER, SISTER, WHEN YOU FLIP THE SWITCH, THE LIGHT COMES ON. &gt;&gt; IT DON'T MATTER. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHOUTING. IS NOT ABOUT THIS. IT'S IT'S ABOUT WORKING ACCORDING TO THE LAWS. AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH GRAVITATION. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH ELECTRICITY. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH THE POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WANT THE POWER OF GOD IN YOUR MIDST, YOU HAVE TO WORK ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE [screaming] WORD OF GOD. SO GOD'S NOT GOING TO MOVE ON IF YOU GOT SOMETHING THERE THAT'S OFFENDING HIM. SOMETIMES GOD WILL ALLOW SOMETHING TO COME OVER YOUR LIFE THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY HUMBLE YOU TO NO PEACE BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR THIS MINISTER TO GO PULL THAT OFF OF YOU WHENEVER THAT VERY THING THAT'S ON YOU IS TO GIVE YOU A WEAPON TO GET YOU BACK TO THE PLACE OF GOD? &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS GOD ALLOWS IT. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. SATAN IS ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS UNLESS GOD ALLOWS IT. &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO HAVE HIS APPROVAL. SO NO MATTER WHAT'S [screaming] COMING AT ME, THAT DEVIL CAN LAUGH ALL HE WANTS TO. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU DEVIL, THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS MY GOD ALLOWED IT AND IT'S FOR A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD IS THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT YOU WILL BEAR FRUIT AND YOUR FRUIT SHALL REMAIN. &gt;&gt; A SHEEP DOESN'T HAVE TO MANUFACTURE WOOL OR PUMP UP WOOL. THAT THAT SHEEP don't have to say, "BOY, I HOPE I CAN BEAR WOOL TODAY." HE DON'T have to do that. &gt;&gt; You know what he's got to do? Eat the grass &gt;&gt; and drink the water &gt;&gt; and live with the shepherd &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? You can take a sheep. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He has all the potential to bear the wool. &gt;&gt; But you know what? If he's not in the right prov right environment all the time and if he ain't eating the word of God, if you're not keeping yourself in the right environment, that sheep will look sickly. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happened to a lot of the church of God. They look sickly &gt;&gt; when it comes to the manifestation of the word of God. It's not because they don't have the potential. That sheep's whole system inside of him is a sheep. Everything inside of him is already there. Every all the things that he needs to do to bear wool is already there. And I'm here to tell you, every single person I'm talking to you right now, every divine promise of the word of God is already inside you. &gt;&gt; All you got to do IS BELIEVE. THAT'S THE ONE THING, BROTHER, LISTEN TO ME. THAT'S WHAT SATAN IS TRYING TO ATTACK SO HARD AGAINST THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR OF PEOPLE AROUND THE CHURCH IS TO KEEP YOU FROM BELIEVING. &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST WEAPON YOU HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW WHY YOU KNOW WHY DAVID WAS ABLE TO KILL THE LION AND THE BEAR? HE BELIEVED HE COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS ABLE TO SLIDE GOLIATH? HE BELIEVED HE COULD DO IT. &gt;&gt; AND YES, THAT'S WHY GOD'S TRYING TO GET HIS CHILDREN TO SAY, "YOU CAN DO IT. [screaming] YOU CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST ME. YOU CAN DO IT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT HIS LIFE INSIDE YOU. &gt;&gt; If you have it inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Some of the greatest miracles I've seen God do is when I didn't feel like I had an ounce of faith. &gt;&gt; When I felt like I had nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then God would do something and I was like, "How in the world did that just happen?" &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We must seek to be in the will of the spirit. You know a military is if a military is going to to take a mountain, every soldier has got to get in the same will. &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Daniel? That soldier cannot just take it up in himself and say, "You know what? I know they're want to take this mountain right here, but I said, let's go take this one. Let's go get it." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He's got a gun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's got the the hat, got the combat boots. Let's go do it. I'm I'm going to go to you. I see this other mountain over here. I said, "Let's go take it." And he can go fight that. Even though he's got all the He's got the message book. He's got the Bible. He's got everything. I'm going to go take this mountain. &gt;&gt; He's got one thing wrong. &gt;&gt; God didn't tell him to do it. &gt;&gt; He did it. He's trying to do it himself. And when you try to do it in yourself, you will be alone &gt;&gt; and you'll face the consequences. &gt;&gt; But listen me, when God tells him, you go take that mountain, &gt;&gt; you go do that, you got the entire army, navy, air force, &gt;&gt; everything that is in the database is behind you. &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Daniel? You can't just go out there and say, I'm going to start laying hands on everybody I taught in the name of Jesus Christ. The name of Jesus Christ. Name of Jesus Christ. You can do it all you want to. And hey, praise God, maybe something will happen. But I'm going to tell you something. When God tells you to do it, &gt;&gt; when God tells you, you go pray for that person. &gt;&gt; You go lay your hands on that person and you pray for that person. When you are doing that, what is that? It is all of heaven backing you up and saying, "I am backing you up. God, I will answer the prayer." It's not just you, brother. Listen to me. You, every one of you, I'm talking to you tonight. You are a soldier for the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord has not called you just to sit on a bench and fill space and blow air. God has called you for a purpose that God can use you. God can lead your life. God that you can testify the Lord is my shepherd. You'll be there sometimes, brother and sister, God will tell you, you pray for that baby. And you'll think to yourself, who am I to pray for that baby? Don't matter who you think you are. Pray for the baby. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here to tell you when you do that, brother and sister, you can move a mountain that no great preacher, not even brother Windle may move that mountain because he didn't tell brother Windle to do it. He told you to do it &gt;&gt; because it's obedience. WHENEVER YOU ARE WALKING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? You are seeking the will of the father. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME. YOU AND YOU SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE GIANTS ON TOP OF YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. I GOT TO PAY THESE BILLS. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THESE BILLS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Give me a testimony. Okay. Well, back my wife and I, we were so strapped. We didn't know how in the world we're going to pay our bills ourself. And in yourself, you're like, God, how are we going to do this? Lord, we help you help do it. And then talking to somebody at work and they were saying, "I've got such as financial burden." Talking to a man and uh he said, "I just don't I hate my job. I don't want to do my job anymore." And I said, "I'm going to tell you what my God answers prayer. I believe we can pray and God will show you exactly where you need to go. My God is awesome." Few months ago, here I'm tell, Lord, how am I going to help my prayer? But here we over here speaking faith. You know, you ever felt that way? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I told him, I'm telling you what, my God answers prayer. God will beat everything that you have need of. I'm telling you, he's he's just awesome. didn't sell him a car, but I got to talk to him about the Lord. &gt;&gt; He comes called me back about three weeks later. He said, "Hey, you going to be available? I'd like to talk to you." I said, "Yeah, absolutely. I think I'm going to buy a car from you. Come see me." He said, "Well, I got to give you a testimony, Brother Daniel." He said, "I didn't know what we were going to do when you told us that." And he said, "I took what you said. I told my wife said, "Let's just pray about it. We believe God's going to answer our prayer. God will meet our needs. I'm telling you, baby." He said, "This man was just telling it like it is." I think mind you, a few months ago, I was like, "I don't know how we're going to do this." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, I I told him, I said, I don't know. I said, I need to we need to take what he said and we need to run with that. I believe that a guy he don't even ever talk to at his church, a big goes to a big church apparently. A guy he never even talks to had been calling him and said that uh he said uh for about two weeks he called me over and over and over and he said I finally picked up the phone and called him back. I'm so sorry. I've been busy. He said, "Hey, I'm going to open up a new company." He said, "And I want you to lead the company." He said, "I'm giving you a new car. I'm giving you this finance. I'm giving you this. I'm giving it." He said, "Daniel," he said, "I NEVER THOUGHT I DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR IT." HE SAID, AND I SAID, "THAT'S MY GOD. THAT'S MY GOD." HE GOES, I GO, "OH MY LORD." [laughter] &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IN YOURSELF, YOU FEEL SO BEAT DOWN LIKE I DON'T GOT AN OUNCE OF FAITH AT ALL THAT I CAN DO IT. BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUR IT'S NOT FOR YOU, IT'S FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. [screaming] WELL, A BODY DOESN'T LIVE FOR ITSELF. IT LIVES FOR THE REST OF THE BODY. AND LISTEN TO ME, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU WANT TO HAVE VICTORY IN YOUR LIFE? START LIVING FOR THE BODY. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO THE CALLING THAT GOD PUT ON YOUR HEART BECAUSE GOD WILL WORK IN A DEEP CALL TO THE DEEP. GOD WILL INSPIRE YOUR HEART TO SAY A CERTAIN WORD AND SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE HUNGRY FOR THE VERY WORD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; It's a deep call to the deep. &gt;&gt; And praise the Lord, the man got a new car and got him a new job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes whenever you feel like you ain't got an ounce of faith in the words that you're speaking, you don't even know what lives you're changing. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'm fixing to get back on my text. I'm going to share something with you. The greatest witness that we give in this life is when we don't know people are watching us. &gt;&gt; It's easy to walk up right whenever someone's seeing us and let me put my head up and only believe. All things are possible because everyone's looking at you. &gt;&gt; But brother and sister, your greatest witness is when you don't know anyone's looking at you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And you are going through the grind &gt;&gt; and you're being a believer. &gt;&gt; You're living the life of a believer. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, every person I'm talking to right now in this life, you will go through trials. Well, you feel like God answering my prayers. I can't feel like I can't get no ground. I'm here to tell you God is trying you in front of the people. That's right. &gt;&gt; God is trying you to show the world what it means to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's easy to be a believer and everything's going to good. &gt;&gt; Brother Window, if I give you a million dollars, come here, buddy. Give you a million dollars. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the smile on this man's face. [laughter] I ain't got it, buddy. It It's easy. It would be easy to praise God. IT'D BE EASY TO SMILE. GAVE ME A MILLION DOLLARS. Praise God. THERE AIN'T NOBODY in here wouldn't BE SMILING IF I DIDN'T. THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, HE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A MILLION DOLLARS IS. IT'S STILL smile cuz I GAVE A MILLION DOLLARS. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD GAVE US SOMETHING WAY BETTER THAN A MILLION DOLLARS. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US HIS FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE US HIS FRIENDSHIP. GOD GAVE US SOMETHING THAT'S SO VALUABLE, SO MORE VALUABLE THAN ANYTHING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE COULDN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT HE GAVE IT TO US. &gt;&gt; I THINK ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES ABOUT THE ARK. GOD DOES STRANGE. HE ASKED YOU TO do strange stuff sometimes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You think about when HE TOLD NOAH, "NOAH, I WANT YOU TO go build an ark. I'm going to cause rain to come from the sky. I want you to use this ark and I want you to use gopher wood." I want you to think about how ridiculous that must have looked to the people around him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to go use water that so I'm going to use wood that soaks up water and I'm going to build up an ark, build all these animals on. It looks absolutely ridiculous. &gt;&gt; But what was God showing him? In order to prepare that ark for the flood, the judgment that was going to take place, you'd have to take another tree and beat the life out of that tree and then get that raisin and you would heat that raisin up. And because that gopher wood is so [snorts] thirsty, you could take that life and you can pour that life right into that gopher wood. And that gopher WOULD HAVE JUST SUCK IT RIGHT UP on the inside of it because it's so thirsty. You know, HE TOLD HIM, "YOU PITCH THAT THAT THAT ARC FROM THE INSIDE OUT." AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE IT WAS THE PITCH THAT IT SUCKED INSIDE OF IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT MADE IT STRONG. [screaming] WELL, WAS IT A TYPE OF JESUS CHRIST? THEY BEAT THE LIFE OUT OF JESUS CHRIST. BUT YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I [screaming] THAT ARE SO SO THIRSTY FOR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. WHAT DID GOD DO? HE TOOK HIS LIFE AND POURED THAT LIFE INSIDE OF US. IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF US THAT SAYS, "I WANT THAT." &gt;&gt; Listen to me. You find yourself, you know why a person smokes and drinks and does marijuana and does the things they do? You know why you do that? It's because you are thirsty for something. &gt;&gt; There's something inside of you that wants something. You're thirsting for something and you're trying to fill that call. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Don't give that to things to the world. Give that to God when you have that. Don't turn on another television show. Don't turn on another music. Listen to me. When you feel that THIRST ON THE INSIDE of you, IT'S BECAUSE GOD HAS GOT A DEEP CALL INSIDE YOUR HEART. He wants to put his life inside you. &gt;&gt; And listen to me, it's the voided parts that he feels that's what made it strong. &gt;&gt; The pitch &gt;&gt; and God wants us, God does it by a calling. Go listen to me. It never changes. God always leads his people by calling. &gt;&gt; He'll put a hunger and a thirst in you. hunger and thirst for righteousness because whenever you're hunger and you're thirsting for something, you're going to eventually get up and do something about it. Listen to me. God is g he he will put a hunger and a thirst for you. If you have this hunger and thirst that I want more, &gt;&gt; I want more than what I'm settling for. Whenever Moses was calling the people out and they were going into the promised land, listen to me. Those people at at first they were crying, Lord, let us go worship God. Let us go worship God. I want to get out of here. God help me. And their calls reached a profit where God began to call the people out. But along the journey, somewhere along the way, friends, they got comfortable and they said, "You know what? Let's just build houses. Let's just do the things we're doing. We're just praising God. We got the words of a prophet." They were content. They didn't want to move forward. And listen to me in the same thing in the spiritual of the message of the hour. Many people been called out of the denominational system. You come out of those things and you going good. We're praising God. We're in the message of the hour. But they've got comfortable. &gt;&gt; We are not meant to stop here. God has called us all the way into the land to where you can positionally know who you are calling you from that to that other land. Brother and sister, &gt;&gt; am I preaching to myself today? Y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It's a hunger and a thirst for a move of God. I pray that I don't ever get to a point to where I'm just can't intently just going to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, we got a calling in our life, a calling in our midst to where we can reach that other side. But in order for you to get to the other side, you have got to be tried. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; There can be times whenever you see other people falling to the side, falling to the side, falling to the side. They used to worship God, praise God with you, and where they at? They begin to fall to the side, but you haven't fallen to the side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to praise God whenever you're in the mountain tops. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So easy when you got the million dollars, brother Window, the smile, but it's whenever you I don't even know how I'm going to pay my bills. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to do this. &gt;&gt; What is it? Cuz you'll see somebody else that don't even try to serve God and God meets their needs. &gt;&gt; You see, they don't even try. I talked to a man yesterday. Don't even try. You know, he'll go out and do everything and uh and smoke and drink and do everything else and just say, "I just love it. I know I shouldn't be doing I do it anyway. Went to the gambling joint and come back with $6,000. So look at here. $6,000. What I want two two. The devil will try to use that to dangle that in front of you and say, "You know what? &gt;&gt; That's good, brother." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't want the $6,000. &gt;&gt; I want the fellowship of my Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Because that is more valuable than any money. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? That $6,000 ain't going to be worth very much anymore pretty soon. It's our fellowship with the Lord. Listen to me, brother. That de Listen to me, brothers. That that devil, the way he'll try to get you to do or sister, he'll try to put that you had that fence around your house. &gt;&gt; And it's a privacy fence, right? And so they don't see what's going on inside your house. But you know what that devil will get you to do? Wonder what's on the other side of that fence. &gt;&gt; What's it, you know, you got your beautiful WIFE OR YOU GOT your beautiful HUSBAND RIGHT HERE. YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT WHAT GOD GAVE YOU, BUT THAT DEVIL will dangle that across that fence. What if what's on the other side OF THAT FENCE? &gt;&gt; WHAT IF I begin to peek through the THROUGH THE THROUGH THE WOOD AND BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE? THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST TOOLS OF THE DEVIL IS TO TRY TO HIT YOU a person. What are you missing? &gt;&gt; What else is over there? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that devil will dangle dangle dangle dangle WITH THE WORLD. THE SISTERS OF THIS WORLD. YOU HAVE GOT A A COMBAT WHERE THEY FIGHT EVERY DAY WITH THE SOUL OF THE WORLD WITH GLAMOUR AND HOLLYWOOD AND ALL THESE THINGS OF WOMEN THAT DON'T HAVE CHILDREN. WOMEN DON'T DO THAT. THEY KEEP THESE PERFECTLY PHYSIQUE BODIES IN FRONT OF AND [laughter] THAT TRY TO TORMENT THE WOMEN THAT'S THE SISTERS THAT ARE TRYING TO CARRY THE HOLINESS IN THIS HOUR. WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO? DEGRADE THEM, MAKE THEM THINK THEY'RE NOT PRETTY, YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH, YOU'RE NOT THAT. AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING? TRYING TO DANGLE IN FRONT OF THE SONS of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. where sons of God will get their eyes off of something that's so beautiful, so pure, SOMETHING SO HOLY THAT GOD GAVE YOU AS A GIFT. AND YOU HE'S GOING TO YOU'RE HE'S GOING TO TRY TO TURN YOUR EYES OVER. LOOK AT THIS WORLDLY THING. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; It's vice versa for the man and the woman and the man. &gt;&gt; Satan does not change his tactics. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Eve had everything that she needed in Adam. fellowship, a man of God, a man that loves the Lord, a man that was upright, a man that treated her right. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? Dangle this other guy out there, the serpent. &gt;&gt; Dangled this guy out there to get something else. Listen to me. That's how he did it back then. The devil's trying to do the same thing now. And listen, listen what brother Daniel's trying to tell you. God has given us a pure, absolute, holy message. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has shown us what's true. And rather than staying with what's true, that devil is trying to get you to turn your eyes off of that pure thing over to something else that's more pretty, something that's more beautiful, just a beautiful worship. We don't have to preach against the way you dress anymore. We don't have to preach about those things. We don't have to preach against hair anymore. We don't have to do that anymore. That stinking devil trying to get it to relax. I say pray to your p your pastor, your preacher. Keep preaching it straight, BROTHER WINDLE. DON'T DEVIATE ONE WAY. KEEP GOING FORWARD. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT DEVIL IS TRYING [screaming] SO HARD TO TEMPT FROM WHAT'S PURE AND HOLY THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO YOU TO SUBSTITUTE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. WE LIVE IN A WORLD TODAY, BROTHER AND SISTER, WHERE THE WOMEN DON'T WANT TO HAVE BABIES ANYMORE. THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE BIRTH. WHY? BECAUSE IT CHANGES THEIR FORM, CHANGES THE WAY THEY WALK. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU LOOK A little different when you have a baby. &gt;&gt; I figure I get at least one amen. You feel different. &gt;&gt; YOU IT MAKES YOU WALK DIFFERENT. IT MAKES YOU ACT DIFFERENT. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A BIRTH. &gt;&gt; AND I'M [screaming] HERE TO TELL YOU, THAT'S THE THING WITH THE CHURCHES TODAY. THEY DON'T WANT BIRTHS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; JUST TAKE THE FORM OF THE CHURCH. JUST START DRESSING LIKE THIS, ACT LIKE THIS, and you're part of the body. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN TAKE A A HEN CAN LAY EGGS, A BUNCH OF EGGS. YEAH, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HAVE ALL THESE EGGS AND BUT IF THAT HEN HAS NEVER BEEN WITH A ROOSTER, THAT HEN CAN SIT ON THOSE EGGS UNTIL IT CAN'T EVEN STAND ANYMORE. IT WILL NEVER HATCH ANYTHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT HEN HAS GOT TO BE WITH THE ROOSTER BECAUSE THE MALE IS WHAT CAUSES THAT [screaming] THAT THAT HEN TO BE ABLE TO NOT JUST LAY AN EGG, BUT LAY AN EGG THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BEAR BIRTHS. [screaming] AND LISTEN TO ME, BROTHER AND SISTER. WE DON'T WANT JUST CHURCH MEMBERSHIP. WE DON'T WANT JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE COMING TO CHURCH. WE WANT INDIVIDUALS [screaming] THAT WILL GET WITH THE ROOSTER JESUS CHRIST THAT WILL DRAMATIZE YOU ON THE INSIDE OF YOU WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A GENUINE NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MESSAGE AROUND THE MESSAGE. [screaming] PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING BORN AGAIN. YOU TAKE THE FORM OF A CHURCH, THEY'LL SERVE GOD FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY QUIT. [screaming] WHY? THEY NEVER GOT BORN AGAIN. COME ON. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU GET BORN AGAIN, YOU CAN'T GO BACK. [laughter] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING YOU NEED TO GO BACK. YOU'VE BEEN TRANSFORMED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? IN GARDENING, YOU CAN TAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT A A PICKLE IS? It's a cucumber. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TAKE THAT CUCUMBER, &gt;&gt; PUT IT IN THE SOLUTION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And you pull it out. It'll smell like a a pickle. You can taste like a pickle on the outside. But bite into it. &gt;&gt; It's still a cucumber. &gt;&gt; You got to put it in the sauce a little longer. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Pull it out. Smells more like a pickle. Still tastes like a pickle. Still a cucumber. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, you let it stay in the solution. &gt;&gt; You let it terry inside that beautiful juice. And that juice that it is carrying in will be the very juice that transform it from a cucumber into a pickle. And then once that thing is transformed into a pickle, it can never go back to being a cucumber. Even though it even if it wanted to, but why would it want to? &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's the way it is with the son and daughter of God. If we will carry IN THE JUICE OF THE HOLY GHOST, BROTHER AND SISTER, NOT JUST FOR ONE DAY, NOT FOR JUST TWO WEEKS, NOT FOR JUST ONE YEAR. STAY IN HIS PRESENCE. SEEK HIS WILL. OH, GOD, [screaming] TRANSFORM ME FROM THE INSIDE OUT. I WANT IT TO BE. WHENEVER SEE ANYTHING BITES INTO ME, IT SAYS THAT'S A SON OF GOD. THAT'S THE real deal. CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST HAVING THAT PICKLE WITHOUT PRESSURE, YOU YOU CAN FOOL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; You can FOOL PEOPLE. YOU TAKE THAT CUCUMBER and stick IT IN THAT JUICE, YOU CAN fool people and think that's a cucumber. It's been transformed. But you take you cause things to break that thing open and you'll find out what's on the inside. And listen to me. Whenever we are tried, brother and sister, whenever you're going through the fire, you're going to be crushed sometimes so squeezed so hard you can't. You feel like all the life is being squeezed out of you, but all that's coming out is the rose of Sharon. &gt;&gt; Sweet savor of the Lord. Something inside you said, "I don't know why I'm going through what I'm going through, but I know one thing. I love the Lord. I love him. I just want to SERVE HIM. HE'S BEEN SO GOOD TO ME. Everything I've got's gone. I I don't know what I'm going to do about him. But one thing I know, I love him. If he cast me into hell, I love him. If he takes me up there, I'll love him. LISTEN TO ME. THAT'S ALL GOD WANTS. HE WANTS A GOD, A PEOPLE THAT LOVE HIM. NO MATTER WHAT, GOD, I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO SERVE YOU, LORD. LISTEN. WE DON'T WANT TO TRY TO BE SOMETHING BIG. BE SOMETHING SMALL. YOU KNOW, A BE A LITTLE SPLINTER THAT GOD CAN USE TO START A FIRE. DON'T TRY TO BE THIS BIG DESK. BE SOMETHING SMALL. BE A LITTLE SPLINTER. SAY, "GOD, LET MY LITTLE SPLINTER OF MY LIFE BE A FIRE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE." LORD, LET THEM BE THE BIG FIRE. I DON'T NEED TO BE THE BIG FIRE. I JUST WANT YOU TO BE LIFTED UP. LORD, IF I IF THAT THAT'S MY MISSION IN THIS LIFE IS JUST TO BE A SPLINTER. I WANT TO BE A HAPPY SPLINTER. I WANT TO DO IT [screaming] WITH PRIDE. I WANT TO DO IT WITH JOY. NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING, WHAT IF YOUR CALLING IS TO HOLD THAT DOOR OPEN FOR THE CHURCH, [screaming] DO IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO IT WITH THE LOVE OF GOD. EVERY DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP, PRAY, "LORD, LET ME BE USED BY YOU TODAY. HELP ME TO REACH SOMEBODY AT THE STORE TODAY. LET ME BE THE LIGHT TODAY." &gt;&gt; LISTEN to me. THAT'S OUR CALLING. &gt;&gt; THAT IS YOUR CALLING as a son and daughter of God to express the mercy that God put in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man the other day, yesterday. Lost everything. He was real bitter at verses. I was selling his brother a truck. Had his brother with him and uh forgive me. &gt;&gt; He was a free will Baptist pastor selling him a truck. He said, "That's my brother over there." I said, "Oh, okay. Awesome." And I know he kept staying kept standing away from me. He didn't want to talk to me very much. And uh after a little bit, I just tried to be kind to him best I could. And it come time to finance part where he went to the finance office and I just kept trying to spread my kindness over to him. I got him to sit down at my desk, thus to talk to him a little bit. And I could see this stone cold around him. And I don't know how to explain it, but God's presence began to come down right there where we're at. And I I told him, I said, "I'm going to tell you something." I leaned my chair back. I said, "I don't know what you're going through, but my God loves you. And this man's turned his eyes just into tears." And he said, "I know he does. My brother tells me that all the time. I know he does." He said, "But so many things have gone wrong, and I don't understand why. All these different things." I said, "Buddy, I don't know why bad things happen. I'll be honest with you. I honestly don't know. There's some things that we won't know till we get to that other side. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said, "But one thing I know I love him." &gt;&gt; And the man turned his chair. He liked that. Just tears in his eyes. He said, "I know it sounds crazy, but I want to be angry with God so bad." He said, "But something inside me makes me love him." I said, "That's because you're a son of God." &gt;&gt; Listen to me, brother. We need to be reminded sometimes you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. You are a daughter of God. I know you've been going through a trial. I know you've been going through these things, but listen to me. My God loves you. &gt;&gt; My God has not forgotten about you. He knows right where you are. He will get right eyeball level with you. He will meet with you. I want to challenge you today that when you leave this place that you will not just leave like another church service, but may you be inspired by the love of God inside your heart that you will give that love to somebody else. Spread the blanket of love around somebody. Spread the blanket of grace around somebody. It's not we're right AND YOU'RE WRONG. WE'RE ALL wrong without him. &gt;&gt; We need him. HE'S THE ONE THAT DID IT. HE'S THE SAVIOR. HE'S THE SHEPHERD. ALL WE [screaming] GOT TO DO IS FOCUS ON HIM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENNHAM TALKED ABOUT THE MAN TRYING TO SELL A HAMMER. HE SAID, "YOU DON'T GO TO THAT GUY AND SAY, "GET THAT JUNKY HAMMER OUT OF HERE. USE A man's hammer." He didn't really use say that's that's basically what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's all about presentation. When you do that, be that's a nice hammer. Oh, that's nice. Can I see it? Oh, that's a good hammer. Why don't you try this one? It's all about presentation and listen to me and selling, brother and sister. You know why a lot of people don't sell the product? They're not selling it right. They're not demonstrating it right. Let me show you something. When I was little, I used to love using a spit stone. I thought I'd use my knife and I [sighs] Anybody ever do that? There one of you. This whole congregation. Two. What a shame. Three. That's one of the greatest joys of my life. little spit stone. I'd take that knife and I'd put that thing on that stone, brother and sister, and I'd just glide that thing just ever so gently, and you There's something else that works even better than spit, and that's oil. When you put that oil on top of that stone, you can slowly glide that knife across that thing. Just slow, ever so gently, and you do at the right angle because you can use the the right stone, the right knife, but when you do it wrong, you'll run that blade. &gt;&gt; And the message of the hour is a stone. It's a revelation. Got the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you can take that word with the message of the hour. And if you go at that thing with the wrong angle, you will run the effect of that knife. And brother and sister, we do not want to do that in ourselves of taking this message because we're using the wrong approach to other people and you're hurting them more than helping them. &gt;&gt; But when you do it the right way, brother, you can take the word and the message of y, it'll make that thing cut deeper than you ever thought. You'll see scriptures and it's like, "Oh my gosh, I have seen that my whole life. I've never seen that before." What it is, it's the approach. You got to have the right approach to the word. And listen to me, brother and sister. You you want the right approach to the word of this message in your life in holiness. When we will approach it in the right way, we'll get the right effect. &gt;&gt; I want to say this very clearly. Listen to what I'm saying. You can use a perfectly good knife, a perfectly good stone, but when you approach it the wrong way, you will run that blade. And that's a lot of people have done that. They've hurt people rather than helping them &gt;&gt; because of the wrong approach. Listen to me. Jesus was kind. But there come time he pulled out the whips. &gt;&gt; But who did he call out the whips to? The people that were defying him. You listen at different times where brother Brener preached on certain things. He would hammer those women just as hard as can be. Boy, you look at another he's just as kind as can be. What is it? Because he is the situation that he is in. And sometime there'd be a woman playing the piano that maybe her blouse wasn't exactly right, but he said she's got the right spirit. He didn't bash that woman. She had the right spirit. Listen, listen to what brother Daniel's trying to say to you. Let's strive to have the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you get the right spirit, everything else will work out. &gt;&gt; Seek to be in the right spirit. Lord, help me to have the right demeanor to where someone's around me, they say, "You know what? I may not agree with what you have to say, but you got the right spirit." Do y'all know if somebody else that someone said that to? &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham, I may not agree with you, but you sure got the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, if we're following that same message, we should be the same fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham talked about on that other side, he said it was a love beyond sublime. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that happens on this side. We don't just all of a sudden get transformed from this old bitter thing that we are to the sweet loving thing over there. It happens on this side. It's a love that comes. A love that bulls out for the starchiness that all this stuff comes. You know what brother Ram said will bull all that out. Love, a divine love. A love that will just come inside you and burn out and bull out. Because I'm tell you what, when you're in his presence, you can't look down on anybody. Am I telling the truth? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about when in order for him to pray for somebody, he said, "I got to be able to get in their shoes. &gt;&gt; I got to feel what they're feeling." &gt;&gt; Because when you can really get their feeling, you can meet the meet the meet it on their level. And listen, I'm challenge you as your brother today. Strive to have that love for your brother and your sister. &gt;&gt; Because the devil will anoint people to irritate you. There's some people you just love to be around. Just love it. Like be around s brother Robert, sister Banna. Just just just love them. Cut from the same cloth. You get some other people like man. Praise God. A little that goes a long way. I don't mean that in a bad way. Point that to oursel. We don't want that to be us to where we got to be careful because we put off an atmosphere. We put off an atmosphere and that atmosphere is what you think about, what you talk about. There's some people you're around them and you say, "Hey, how you doing?" And you just ask the wrong words cuz you're there for 15 minutes of telling you everything that's wrong in the county. &gt;&gt; I had a brother one time. He's still alive. Bless his heart. [laughter] I didn't mean it like that. He's a good brother. But I had I worked at a tire shop. And he'd come to say, "Brother Daniel, I want to talk to you." Said, "I we need to we need to pray about a prayer request." I said, "Okay, yeah, absolutely. We'll pray about it." And he began to tell me everything that was wrong about the person. And it it wasn't he wanted prayer. He wanted to talk about somebody. You know, these words, when you speak bad about somebody behind their back, it's not killing them. &gt;&gt; You're killing their influence. &gt;&gt; And listen to me. We should never sit in a room and let our brother's name hit the ground. &gt;&gt; Cuz when we do that, it's just like murder. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me about the love of Jesus Christ and then the same mount start running your brother down in the dirt. &gt;&gt; And I love this brother. I I don't mean this as a bashing. I'm the only way I know how to get the point across. Okay? Every day come back to, "Hey, brother Dan, want to talk about this?" Didn't have a thing about prayer request. I want to talk about somebody. So, I let him get through his spill about what it was. I said, "Hey, brother, we're going to pray for this need and then we're going to pray for you. We're going to pray that God will help you seeing all from seeing all the bad stuff in everybody. And we began to pray and we prayed for him and I prayed God to live him. But you know what? He never come back and do that again. Sometimes in an awkward situation, it's very awkward whenever someone wants to run somebody down. When you have to stop and say, "I don't want to talk like this." &gt;&gt; It's very uncomfortable. But let me challenge you. Do it. &gt;&gt; Hey, turn the conversation. Hey, say something nice about them. In time someone starts talking bad about that brother, you find something nice about them. You speak something good about them because that is your brother. That is your sister. And we are running this same race trying to get to that other side. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. That right there will fix a lot of problem in churches &gt;&gt; is stopping that gossip &gt;&gt; because bad gossip, there's good gossip and there's bad gossip. That's probably not the word. It's probably testifying, right? Talking good about somebody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But listen to me. when you're using the bad words and bashing somebody. That's why I love you guys. I know that if someone tried to speak bad about brother Daniel, my brother say, "Hey, &gt;&gt; he can't sing worth a lick, but I like it." [laughter] You got to find something to say like, "Well, I got that." [laughter] This is one of those icky situations. I'm trying to get out of it. Amen. I believe the bride does not persecute bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. doves. You will not see them. I remember we lived in Elma, Arkansas. I be I was watching I was going to the there were time just sitting there talking to the Lord and I think I was whittling a stick at the time sitting there just cutting sitting on the front porch. I was looking up over there and I saw this uh dove sitting out there and just being what it was just being a dove and you know the what however the noise they do just being as them and just so beautiful. Have you ever noticed that doves are so elegant, so beautiful, and all of a sudden these other birds come over there and tried to attack that dove? &gt;&gt; And that little dove finally just flew straight away and just got away from him. And the Lord spoke to me and said, "That's exactly the way it is with us. You're trying to serve the Lord the best you can and people come over there and try to pick at you and pick at you and pick at you. It's not them. It's a stinking spirit &gt;&gt; that comes on that person. &gt;&gt; When that person's tearing you down, it's because there's a spirit on them. They don't mean to do it. It's a spirit on them. &gt;&gt; So, don't look bad at that person when they're doing it. Pray that God will help them with that spirit that's trying to come on you. But listen to me. If you entertain that spirit long enough, that spirit will come on you. &gt;&gt; Spirits travel. Spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; They just change dwelling places. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. We don't want those things. We we want the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; where that Holy Spirit will come and you bring a refreshment to somebody. &gt;&gt; We don't be a bitter cactus. &gt;&gt; You know a cactus, you know what's wrong with a cactus? You get close to them, they pick at you. They stick at you. I remember when I was when I was a boy, I was riding a horse. We used to I got to tell the whole story. I was country. We lived in the country. I was riding in nothing but my boxers on top of this horse. No rains, no nothing. I'm just free. I'm riding this horse way in the back and I go real sharp around the curve and it was a racing horse and it had literal horsepower. When he would take off, you would literally hit the ground. So, you have to hang on to it. I was riding this horse out in the wild doing my own business and it did a sharp turn and threw me inside this cactus &gt;&gt; from head to toe cactus and my mom had to hold me down. Every single one of those and it was a tough lesson for me. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you I didn't do that again. Sometimes God will allow you to get thrown off the horse and throw you into a cactus &gt;&gt; and you got to endure the picking of the cactus. &gt;&gt; Now, I can say, "Oh, God, forgive me. I didn't mean to do it." No, God forgives you. But he don't take the cactus out. &gt;&gt; You got to endure it. You will reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. If you want you want good things to happen in your life, sew good things. &gt;&gt; You can't sew bad seed in your life and expect a harvest of good things. It's not going to work. &gt;&gt; You know what? You'll reap what you sow. You can say, "God, forgive me." You You know what? Whenever you get into a lot of debt, you can say, "God, forgive me. I love you, Lord, and the Lord forgive you." You can call that credit card, say, "Hey, I'm going to tell you something. I gave my heart to the Lord, and he forgave me of it all." That that credit card guy ain't going to say, "We do, too. Bless God. I wish they did." &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm eyeball level with you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Lord. PRAISE JESUS. HE SET ME FREE. [laughter] Credit card says, "Yeah, your payment's due on the 15th." You still got to reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll sow bad seed and you still got to reap it. &gt;&gt; But the difference is you're back in fellowship with your maker. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, listen to me. That's the most important thing you have in this life is his fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he can wipe it away anytime he wants to. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the Lord can do it. He can wipe away any he wants to. But don't focus on God wiping your debt about focus on Lord, I want your fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I just want to read one more scripture and we're we're going to try to close. Okay. In Isaiah 55:es 8-11, he says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven runth not thither, but waterth the earth, and make it to bring forth in bud, that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing there, I sent it. And I want to say this to you, brother and sister. God has sent you for a purpose. And you will fulfill your purpose. His word's not going to return to him void. Your mission in this life, you are right where God wants you to be. God knew exactly where you are right now. You're right on time with the Lord. So right here, right now, no matter what your circumstance, say, "Lord, right here, I want to be in your will." And you let God reach the target. Amen. Let's all stand. I want to read another scripture in St. John 15 16. He says, "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of my father in my name, he will give it to you." And one last quote, he says, "Now you got truth, but you've got to come to it in a different than just a big hilarity. You know what I mean? Just something to be hollering about. and I believe in hollering about it has got something to holler about. But be sure you approach that with the very depths of sincerity. If you live a different life than what you should live, keep still until you get that life. Get it get that life gets to living you then automatically. You know a sheep isn't asked to manufacture wool. No, he can't manufacture it. These gifts cannot be manufactured by emotion. This church cannot be manufactured by organization. A sheep bears wool because he is a sheep. He can't help bearing wool for his whole system is made to bear wool. But we but must be what we are on the inside out. You take any apple seed and any whenever you put that seed into the ground, it's going to bear apples. And every apple that will ever be produced is already inside [music] that seed. And listen to me, that's exactly the way it is with us, brother and sister. Every divine promise of God is already inside you. I believe this with all my heart, including our body change. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to do it. that little apple seed. He can look at that whenever that seed, you can you can talk to that little seed if you were and say, "You're going to bear just the prettiest big apple tree you've ever seen. You're going to bear fruit. You're going to bear apples. You're that you could talk to that seed and if that seed was to be able to speak to you without a doubt, he'd say, "I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can do it. I I don't feel any faith. I don't feel anything." But you know what? the person that's speaking to the seed, he already knows what it is capable of. He'll say, "Yes, you can. You can do it because I'm going I'm the one doing it." That person can put that seed inside the ground and put it in the right environment. And that seed may feel like I don't have the faith to do it. I don't know what I don't know how I'm ever going to bear an apple because I don't feel like an apple tree. But you know what? When you put the seed in the right environment, brother, sister, THERE IS A POWER THAT HAPPENS on the inside of that seed. AND IT CAUSES A TRANSFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY. And listen to me, that's the way it is with a son or daughter of God. WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT, THE WOOL WILL COME AUTOMATICALLY. THE FRUITS WILL COME AUTOMATICALLY. THE MANIFESTATIONS WILL COME AUTOMATICALLY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A POWER ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. EVERY PERSON I'M TALKING TO, YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL. WE SING A SONG. WE'VE GOT the power. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's him. It's the YOU HAVE IT INSIDE OF YOU THAT CAN CAUSE HEALING, THAT CAN CAUSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPEN. BUT THE GREATEST THING, BROTHER and sister, is your transformation of a body change. &gt;&gt; If I was to ask you, so tell you right now, you're going to have a body change. &gt;&gt; You're going to take a rapture. &gt;&gt; It's so easy in yourself, I don't feel like I can do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I can do it. I don't have any faith. I don't have this. I don't have that. I don't have it. It don't have a thing with what you have. It's God. Listen to me. That shepherd's the one that saves the sheep. We forget that somewhere along the line, we think that we're the one that's saving oursel. No, it's him. &gt;&gt; He's our shepherd. And we will listen to him. He will lead us to the still waters. He will lead you to where? To the grass where you can eat the word. And whenever you eat that word, brother and sister, the fruits will come automatically. And I'm telling you, I believe this with all my heart. I believe it's so simple. People are overlooking it. The simplicity of the rapture is going to be so simple. It's not because we're trying to pump something up. You're walking in his presence. &gt;&gt; Just like that cucumber sloshing around in that juice day after day after day after day. and thinking, you know what? I don't know if I'm ever going to make it. And the whole time you're staying in his presence, his presence is changing you. You're taking a body change already. You don't look like it. You don't feel like it. Every time you're in his presence, every time you're in his presence, he's transforming. [music] He's transforming. He's transforming. You know, I want I want the real Holy Ghost. You know, people say, "I want the Holy Ghost." And they'll think because I shout or I ran or I spoke in tongues. I did all that. Oh, praise God. I got it. I really want it. I really want it. And they feel like maybe a lot of times they feel like they didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Don't look for emotions like that. Don't look for sensations like that. If you get them, praise God. I get them, too. Don't ever if God tells you to run, run. &gt;&gt; Tells you to shout, shout. &gt;&gt; But listen to me, brother and sister. The key is stay in [music] his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what we need is Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what I mean Pentec Pentecost is not organization. Pentecost is an experience. &gt;&gt; And brother the prophet said this. We we read the Pentecost where the Holy Spirit will come back down on top of the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will lead [music] the individual. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Where he is leading you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you a person can grieve the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit don't go far. He's just right on the branch. He's not far. He wants to come back. He wants to be in your midst. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Something happened and spooked him. You can have a little dove there and I can walk. I could do that and that's that that devil will fly away cuz I spooked it. And there's a lot of time people have griefed the Holy Spirit away from theirel, away from their home, away from their family. I'm going here to tell you something. He wants to come back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That dove of the Holy Spirit wants to come right into your home. He wants to drop down and he wants to fellowship with you lip to ear. Listen to me. He wants you. He wants to come back more than you want him to come back. But you know what? You got to come his way. God cannot God well he cannot live in a a life of sin. He cannot live in a life of filth. He cannot live around a bunch of bickering and arguing. God can't live around those things. Brothers and sister, we shouldn't have those things around our home. The devil will try to do that to cause havoc around the home. What's he doing? Trying to grieve the Holy Spirit away. Listen to me. We should have that that dynamics of the love of God. I'm We need that love more than you more than I can ever express in my mouth. We need that love in our homes and where to where that presence is there because you know what that dove for many homes he's taking its flight. &gt;&gt; But he wants to come back. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask every head to bow your head if you don't mind. Just right where you're at, just humble yourself before the Lord. And I want you to be honest with the Lord this morning. Don't think about anybody around you. No, nothing else matters. All the stuff outside, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters. The only thing matters right here, right now. Are you in fellowship with your maker? Do you have that dynamics that brother Daniel's been talking about this morning of that love of God or something happened and it's caused it to take its flight? Humble, but right where you're at. Do not look around. Humble yourself before the Lord. And I wonder if anybody say, "Brother Daniel, I don't know what's happened, but that love, I feel like it's just moved away, but I want it back. The Lord sees your hand." I believe God honors your honesty. I'm here to tell you, God sees the hands. God sees your honesty. And I'm telling you, he wants to come more than you want him to come. I'm going to pray with you and if you would just pray and if you want to touch the person right beside you and let's just pray together. Father, I humble myself before you this morning. Lord, Lord, I love you so much, Lord. Lord, I thank you for calling me to your word, Lord. I thank you for your mercy, Lord. Lord, you've seen hands that went up across this building, Lord, that said, "Father, I didn't mean to do it, Lord." But something happened along the way, Father. And Lord, I feel like I've just I don't have you like I used to have you, Lord, but I want you, Lord. I want you in my marriage. I want you in my home, Lord. Oh, God. I want you in my workplace, Lord. Oh, God, I ask you, would you walk the aisle, Lord? Every hand that's up across the building, Lord, would you touch those hands, Lord? Oh God, that you would bring such a divine love into their hearts, Lord. Lord, that you'd go through every door, every chamber, Lord. Father, we don't want you just for a savior. We want you to be the Lord of our life, Lord. Lord, Lord of my family, Lord of my Lord, be my guide, Lord. Lord, with so many people falling to the left and to the right, oh God. But Lord, let that not happen to me, but ask for me in my house, Lord. We want to serve you, Lord. Oh God, walk the aisle, Lord. Touch hearts, Lord Jesus. Lord, come in in your gentle way that you want to come, Lord. And Lord Jesus, bring a restoration, Father. Oh God, we love you today. Ask brother Window to come forth. If anyone has, you do not have to come to the front right there where we prayed. But if you see, Brother Daniel, I really would like the ministry to pray for me. We want to open that up to you. If anybody would like to come, ask brother to come forth. to worship and for the [singing and music] so my soul longest is after [singing] thee. &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone are my heart &gt;&gt; to worship you. You [singing] alone are my strength, [music] my shield. To you alone, [singing and music] my spirit heal. [singing] &gt;&gt; You alone [music] are my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. [singing and music] to worship thee. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; You're my friend [music] and you are my brother. [music] &gt;&gt; You [singing] are my king. I want [singing] you, oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; you [music and singing] alone are my strength, [music] [singing] my shield. To you alone does my [singing] spirit yield. [music] &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone are my [music] &gt;&gt; I long to worship &gt;&gt; as the presence of the Lord is [music] here this morning. Brother Daniel had made a statement. He leads by calling. He leads by hunger. He gives [music] desire. He points it out because my sheep know my voice. And if the Holy Spirit is [music] calling you today, he's given you his word and there's something there that's saying, "I I long for that." Right now, let's The festivities can wait. We've got all day, but right now, the master [music] is calling. And if he's calling your voice or calling your name, you sure don't want [music] to push that off. And if you want Brother Black to be to pray with you, I I would say [music] that would be a wonderful time. That would be that would just be what God is looking in this service today because a surrendered heart to the Lord, a surrender to his will is everything. And I know for you young people, there's [music] there's always a lot of things to pull you one way or the other. Many many times we don't understand the we don't understand as a young person a lot of the anguish and things on the inside of us. We [music] we we but when you follow when you find Jesus and you really [music] really put him [clears throat] as the shepherd of your life, it's it's the greatest thing. Turmoil will still be there in all of our lives, but there is a peace [music] that comes with a surrendered heart to the Lord. Elders, we need him, too. We need him in [music] every stage of our lives. &gt;&gt; And so, a new commitment to the Lord as we sing [music] again. Make that commitment to the Lord. Whether you come to the front or as I see the spirit of the Lord is dealing with young and old here today. Just make it make this [music] the service. Lord, I'm just going to make a fresh commitment to you. I I know I've got purpose right here. Maybe you're in the [music] trial, but I can see that my life has purpose. No matter where you are, God is with you. He's leading you. Father, we want to look to you here this morning. Oh God, we give ourselves to you today, Lord Jesus. We want you to be pleased. And as the man of God was ministering this [music] morning, Lord, we could hear your voice. We could hear we could hear purpose. Father, we don't want to just be here just to be here. But Lord, knowing that you've got a divine call and we must surrender or surround ourselves with your presence or we become stickery and prickly and but oh God, we want to be ooze and Lord Lord we want that pickle solution to be through and through Lord Father to where we become exactly what your purpose is for us. Take every sin, take all lukewarmness, take everything out of our hearts that's not pleasing to you. Father, we need you today and we love you, Lord, with all of our heart. We're giving ourselves, we're opening ourselves to you, Lord, because we want to be pregnant with you by your spirit, by your word. We thank you [music] for it, Father. Oh God, we love you. Oh Jesus, we love you. Father, we thank you for it. Lord, you alone are my heart's desire and [singing] I long to worship you. To be [singing] like Jesus. [music] to be like Jesus. [music] On earth I long to be like him [singing] all through life's journey. [singing] &gt;&gt; Yes. From earth to glory, I only ask to be. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Could we take it up a couple of keys? To be [singing and music] like Jesus. to [singing] be like [music] Jesus. On earth I long [singing] to be [music] like you. [singing] All through life's journey [singing] from earth to glory. [singing] I only ask to [singing] be like one more time. Oh, make the commitment to be like [singing] Jesus. Hallelujah. To be like, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. On earth [singing] I long [music] to be like him. All through life's journey. Yes. Yes. My Lord. From earth to gloryy. [singing] I only [music] ask to [singing] be like you. I only [singing] ask to be. [singing] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Is that what you want to [music] be here this morning? Lord, I give you my [singing] heart. I give you my soul. I live [singing] for you alone. [music] Every breath that I take, [singing] every moment I'm away, Lord, have your way [singing and music] with me, Lord. I give you my heart. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, [singing] I live for you. [music] &gt;&gt; Every breath [singing] that I take, every [music] moment I'm awake, Lord, have [singing] your way. Let's try a verse there. Hallelujah. This is myire. [music] &gt;&gt; It's my desire, Lord, to [music] &gt;&gt; honor you, &gt;&gt; Lord. With [music] thought of my heart [singing] I worship you, [music] oh Jesus. All [singing] I have [music] within me, I give [singing] you praise. All I [singing] [music] adore is in you [singing] [music] all together now. Lord, I give you &gt;&gt; give you my [singing] heart. &gt;&gt; Give you my soul. &gt;&gt; Give you my soul. &gt;&gt; I [music] live [singing] for you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Every breath [singing] that I take, every moment I'm away, Lord, have [singing] your [music] way in me. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. [music] I love him here this morning. I appreciate the word of the Lord. God's always right on time. [music] &gt;&gt; His words are just they he just never ceases to amaze me how the Lord knows exactly where we are and what we have need of. And I was thinking the other day or as he was talking about sometimes the Lord uses you when you're feeling like you're the most unspiritual. [music] And um I I gave the testimony here the other day how that Katrina [music] had had text me with a scripture and said that she had had me on her heart during the night and prayed [music] and sent me that little scripture. And she says, "Now it makes you you're making that sound like I was really spiritual." [music] And uh she said I was having nightmares [music] and I was it was it was not a good night for me and I just started praying for people and you come across my heart while I was praying [music] and she said but I was nowhere spiritual. I didn't feel a [music] thing. And uh and I told her, I said, "But the thing is, the Lord gave me my healing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I was I was laying in bed hurting. &gt;&gt; I had been hurting for weeks, hurting, and the Lord healed my tailbone. [music] And there she was the most unspiritual. She says, [laughter] "Amen." [music] And she was praying for me to get her mind off of the nightmare she was having. And here the Lord and the and and and the Lord used it to minister to me. Isn't that amazing? Because God sometimes when we're in our situations, maybe if she would have sleeping good, I wouldn't have came across her mind. Hallelujah. But I came across her mind and she prayed [music] and God used her as the agent for me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it works, but all I know is it works. &gt;&gt; All I know is I was the guy in all of the pain [music] and then why he didn't touch the rest of my back. I don't know that neither. But I do know that when he does things, he he he's God. &gt;&gt; That's right. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just say thank God to know how the reality of his promises and [music] the blessings of his promises. Amen. So we appreciated the word of the Lord here today. [music] Amen. Yes. Give the Lord a hand clap. [applause] Praise the Lord. [applause and music] We um so we're going to uh dismiss here. We've got we've got uh dinner here on the grounds and [music] and um we do have the tent with a few tables in there for for uh some that can't handle [music] the the uh the cold.

Father, again, we want to thank you for the for the wonderful service here this morning, the wonderful message that you've [music] given us, Lord.
