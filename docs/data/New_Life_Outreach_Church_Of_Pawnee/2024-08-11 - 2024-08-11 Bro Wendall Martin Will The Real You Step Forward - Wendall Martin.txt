how pretty you know it's just it's just something how the presence of the Lord can just make all the difference in the world the rain on the outside rain on the inside and so we're sure thankful for that today amen let's look here in the book of uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and then if we could have some monitors up here uh on the on the platform that'd be nice praise the Lord um uh 1 Corinthians 15 and we're going we'll start at the 48th verse and um we'll read three verses there amen the Lord is good to us amen um it says as is the Earthly such are they also that are Earthly earthy and as is the Heavenly so are they also that are Heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption and let's just go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you for your blessings thank you for these wonderful songs Lord that you have placed in our hearts and lips Lord that we can sing to you we thank you Lord for the anointing that is here Lord and and for the moving of your spirit Upon Our young people

kids to go and and father we thank you for the for the vision of the leadership and the and Lord all of the Lord the the laborers there just ask that you would bless them all you would keep your hands upon our our youngans Lord as they as they make their way back home and Lord just ask that you would be with those that aren't here today that that want to be here Lord but they're sick and listening in I pray father that there would be an anointing just come in each one of those homes and and that you would bring healing and encouragement father thank you Lord for bringing brother Dylan through his surgery Lord and and we're just asking for a speedy recovery father asking that you would help him with the pain this morning Lord we just ask that you would be here as we Minister your word that you would be in every word every line that you would confirm it to our hearts and father we'll give you glory and honor we love you Lord with all of our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated this morning amen as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly and uh I I I've got a a a crazy title this morning but amen I my my title could the real you step forward amen and back in the uh in the ' 50s they had the U the videos of uh or they they had a um um a TV show that was called tell the truth and uh uh and so uh there would there were three individuals claiming to be the same person and and so one was real and then two others were Impostors and so there would be a panel that would try to identify which one was the true amen and separate that individual from the ones that were claiming uh to be him or her and so when all the guessing was over and and and everyone is trying to figure out who this person is then they would ask the person with the real uh you the the individual stand up and and so then they would uh truly be able to ident identify who the real person was and and um I I I thought of this as I was uh thinking along these lines as I've been studying Amen in a world of Impostors there is a real you in in a world of Amen it's not what the world tells you who you are amen but it's it's who you genuinely are with within now amen most uh everyone in in the land are are going to put the value on the Earthly uh house that you live in and so they they put all uh of the attention all of the focus on your uh uh on your flesh and and and those concerns and that's the reason why amen uh all of the sin all of the all of the things that are that are out there uh today is appealing to your flesh everything is appealing to your flesh Satan puts his focus upon the physical your physical body amen and so and and and but we understand that there is you were created in the image of God Amen you're your your creation you are a a amen a being that lives in a physical house amen and that physical house has a name it it might wend Martin or it amen but the real you is living inside that house now Satan would try amen to to bring and cast doubt upon that body in which God Lives amen he always tried to do that with with Jesus if thou be the son of of God Amen the body of God then he makes his appeal to the flesh he tells he tells Jesus that amen he he he says command these stones to be turned into bread you're hungry amen but Jesus would always come back with the word and say it is written and and then he would he would make his appeal again and takes him on the Pinnacle of the temple and says uh amen you you know if just cast yourself on the ground and then the angels will will pick you up if you be the Son of God and then the third time he takes him and shows him all of the kingdoms of the world and says you can have them he was appealing to his flesh he was appealing to that body and he didn't realize that the God of all glory lived inside that body amen so he he was doing everything that he can to to attract amen through the pride of life amen the the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh doing everything that would appeal this but he found the wrong guy because it was God living inside that house so while he was trying to appeal to the house amen he could not make his appeal because God lived in that house he was dealing with God can you say Amen now amen do you realize that evil Spirits they those Devils doubt who you are amen they doubt who you are and they try to get you to cast doubt in in your own mind in your own heart amen but brother Brandon would say do you ever think that inside of our body is another man did you know that there that there's another man inside our body he he would say Amen this Inside Man now if it is of god it's the spirit of God that's inside our being so so I want you to really catch this there is a there is a body amen you you live in that body but that which is on the inside is the spirit of God because the genetics of God are within you those your spirit rotated off of God as I'll I I'll give you a quote here in a minute amen it's the same spirit that that that God had when he resisted Satan is the same spirit that you have within you amen and I I I think that's just wonderful amen I I was going to try to find that just real quickly amen it was further on down in the in my in in my notes here but let me see if I can find it amen that spirit of God that something is within you I I I'm I'm glad for that now if you're going to win a battle amen now brother brother Brandon would say here's my analysis of that he says I think that people today that are possessed with this Spirit the spirit apart of these Angelic beings spirits that rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven so in your body amen is the spirit of the Living God amen you are you always were a son you are a son you will forever more be a son Satan doubts it and so he wants to do everything he can to to get to that God on the inside of you amen now if uh uh I I I want to say that you some would say well of course when you are amen uh a born again at an altar then you become a Son of God I say you always were a son you always did there the life the genetics of God within you were were in you at your birth amen so Satan does not want you to wake up he does not want the real you to come to frusion he wants to dampen you by the things of this Mortal life brother Bram would say Amen there in the church age book we have read it a couple times now amen he says the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells amen so now now I want you to understand this what has Satan been trying to do to you all of your life it is trying to hamper the life of God on the inside of you amen why do we have the pornography and why do we have amen all all of the the the the the lust and the and the claes and the pleasures of this life amen today trying to stop the spirit of God from coming to reality in your life well praise the Lord Amen brother Brandon we talk about how the Demons of hell all of these demons will come together amen and and they'll they they'll work in harmony to try to take out the spirit of God here on the earth yes amen now you you you've got to I I want you to stay with me in my thoughts here this morning because amen I I want you to understand that the only Jesus that this world will ever know is is is his Earthly body which is you and me here this morning the spirit of God is in his Earthly body today as it was in his Earthly body in Jesus Christ amen before the coming of the Lord you will never see amen Jesus Earthly body amen the physical body of Jesus Christ the spirit of God lives in human beings today and that's my intent I want that real you to step forward and claim who you are amen I know there's a lot of Impostors I know there's a lot of Amen mimics out there we're not worried about the mimics I want the real you to step forward and it ain't your pretty hair and it ain't your it ain't your good looks amen it is the spirit of God that rotated off of God in the beginning now Amen brother Brandon would talk about evil men and harmony with with the devil amen and and and and he would say anything to blight his name anything to ruin the confidence of the people not knowing that they were possessed of the devil do that they were working in harmony with the devil trying to blacken the name of the son of God Amen those spirits will do that now amen I I I I brother brother Brandon would also say he says now amen he said now if thou be the Son of God he's always doubted it and he still teaches others to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt it he taught Moses he taught all of them to try to doubt it and he's teaching you to doubt it also amen so I I I'm building my platform he's going to try to teach you to doubt the spirit of God in a body amen and if he doubted the the spirit of God living in the Virgin born son of God how much more is he going to doubt the spirit of God living in your mortal flesh amen if the perfect virgin born son and Satan was there to doubt and teaching others to doubt amen then that same uh spirit is here to anoint the people and will even anoint you Amen to doubt who you are but you've got to come back to scripture and then you will find out I am not a wannabe I am the real I am not a wannabe well praise the Lord amen now now we again again we live in a in in a in a society amen that that uh H H that is appealing to the flesh amen we live in a society that shows partiality to a flesh amen if you're poor amen you're treated as poor if you're rich you're treated as Rich if you're amen a politician or if you're this or that amen but I want to say that has nothing to do do you realize that God says that your flesh he will show no respect to your flesh whatsoever amen there in Romans 2:11 it says there is no respect of persons with God and the Amplified it says God shows no partiality no arbitrary favoritism with him one person is not more important than the other amen there in in 1 Peter 1:17 he says if you call on the on the father who without respect of persons judges according to Every Man's work amen now now now I want you to understand this we want to we want to try to amen H H uh lift a a a one person status amen or one person up in our mind or favor a certain person based on their status amen we want to do that that is not the way God works that's righten he doesn't work that way amen we want to say this one is favorable to me this one will bring a a a good good standing in the community this one will help uh uh amen help me in in in my step up the ladder or however you do it amen but God does not judge you or anyone in the kingdom of God according to their person amen your flesh will never will will never earn anything with God Amen and it should not earn anything with one another well can you say amen amen now now there in in Galatians 3 and 28 it says there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus amen the he told there in James 2 and one he says my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons if there come unto you uh come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man and V reignment and you have respected or respect to him that weareth the gay clothing amen man or the nice clothing and say unto him amen sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit under my footstool are ye then partial in yourselves are you become judges of evil thoughts now now what is what are the apostles trying to say as God is looking upon you so must you look at one another you don't look at each other according to the flesh because the flesh is not what God is looking at the flesh is only the house in which God lives in right hallelujah amen so we're we're not we're not interested in Amen in in in someone's person someone's Earthly rank amen but our interest is in the Lord Jesus Christ and that gift on the inside amen that's right uh uh there they there they're in Jude 1 and6 now Jude is talking about certain men that have crept in and the 16th verse he says these are are murmurers and complainers and walking after their own lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage amen but God's not looking to that so so so once again here amen I am saying it does not matter your position in the church when it comes to God it does not matter whether you are poor it does not matter whether you are rich it does not matter whether you're a preacher it does not matter whether you're amen just someone that comes to the congregation amen there is there is nothing that is held in any higher advantage in the kingdom of God other than the grace of God Upon Our Lives and that eternal Gene seed that is within you amen it's the genetics of God within you that makes you who you are amen now Hallelujah y'all can say Amen this morning if you agree amen or I I raise your hand and I'll try to explain it even better now so what we want I want to get this to the get our point across that the that this body cannot and will not ever earn anything with God if it's not going to earn anything with God that I say that we should not put much emphasis on this old body right amen now now we put a lot of emphasis on it but this is a house that you live in amen and just as your regular house has to have painting and and it has to have Renovations and after a while it has to be tore down this house that the spirit of God is living in is someday going to have to be amen put into the ground it's going to have to be bulldozed down because God can's not going to live in this house forever Hallelujah but the real you is going to move to another house amen well praise the Lord amen now Jesus had said now amen there in Luke 16 and4 and and and the Pharisees also who were Covetous and and heard all these things and they derided him and they and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knows your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is an Abomination to the sight of God there in 2 Corinthians 5:16 amen now it begins to talk to us amen it's the Apostle Paul says wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new amen now he's putting the difference now the seed that was within that body has come to life it has been born a new that man has all authority in the Kingdom of Heaven amen now you're still living in that body but you are a new creation amen you are still living in this body here you still have to comb it you still have to feed it you still have to bathe it you still have to do these things but your power comes from that new seed or that amen that seed that predestinated seed before the foundation of the world and it has now just been or uh uh energized can you say amen Amen brother brenon would say Amen this in the in the church age book he says now it says that Heath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means you were right there with him somebody say hallelujah hallelujah in mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world he says that gives an eternal quality to the elect and you can't get away from that amen he goes on down he says these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for more known of God and were in the mind of God and thoughts of God in very uh plain language the true bride of Jesus Christ was in the mind of God eternally amen though not expressed until each came forth in their designated decreed season as each member come forth it become expressed and took its place in the body so now I want now Hallelujah you're living in the body somebody says amen this old good-look body is good brother W amen but this is not who you are the life of God is on the inside of that body and there's where your Authority lies Hallelujah well praise the Lord some say well if I could just get into prayer and I think prayer is is important but you're just as powerful when you're struggling in your prayer life as you are when you're when you're uh in deep prayer you're just as powerful because it's not your prayer that does it it's not your fasting that does it it's not your church attendance that does it it's the genetics of God living in that body now there's going to be many people amen that put all the attention on the Flesh and they can pray every day of their life amen they can they can make a habit of doing these things amen and there are so many Traditions but yet if the seed of God is is not there they are just as weak as they were before they started because the genetics of God is Not In That Body amen can you say amen I I know many of people that has read the church age backward and forward and that can quote it but today they're out there amen they're as lost as lost can be they they were not powerful they might have been powerful in mind they might have been powerful in their body they might have been powerful but they were not powerful before the enemy the devil because only the spirit of God can defeat the Devil amen so it's not your prayer the act of praying that defeats the devil it's not the act of coming to church that defeats the devil it's not the act of singing songs that defeats the devil it's who you are on the inside of you that makes you powerful all right can you say Amen now amen now he would say so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest In the Flesh those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God hallelujah now now brother brother brandham would ask amen he he would say now amen as as he begin to to talk about the old Earthly Tabernacle here and And he as as we look here at at 2 Corinthians 5 and 1 and the Apostle Paul says Paul says we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved now what he's dealing with here he's dealing with your body amen that if this Earthly Temple Al mortal house amen if it falls apart we have an eternal building of God a house not made with hands that is eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven now he is he is he's bringing out clearly this house you're living in right now is has fallen apart and it's time time it's going to be time to move from this house into a new house and he says that new house will never fall apart that new house will never have aches and pains it will never go blind and have back aches amen that new house will be but you do not change you are just changing houses you know what that should make you and me do today that should give confidence Amen to say I don't care what my house looks like my soul is determined to believe God my soul has been Hallelujah I I you know we we try to separate our soul from God you're came from God as we just read that quote you rotated off of it amen as brother Brenham talks about the about the stars and about the galaxies amen he says these were were clinkers that that rotated off of the sun it came off the Sun and here you and I stand today as powerful as we are amen though we're living in this flesh living in a fallen apart body yet in our souls we are H we rotated off the clinker of God rotated off the pillar of fire amen there's an eternal quality about you and you just came to Earth Amen in flesh Amen to manifest your purpose but you were always with God you were always part of God you never you cannot separate yourself from God can you say amen hallelujah he says if we earn to be clothed upon amen the third verse if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for that we that are in this house do Gran being burdened not for that we should be unclothed amen we don't want to we don't want to be without a house we've got to have a house you have got to have a house the spirit of God must live in a body got to live in a body Hallelujah so he not wanting to be unclothed amen but now it says uh we do grow being burden not that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now brother Brandon would say this old Earthly Tabernacle here you know what it is it's the the body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once wear amen now that you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang it in the closet for you've got one better you've got a better coat if it's more up to date than the one that you used to wear that's wore out what it is that garment you are the inside of that the Garment only does what it Bears your image amen what but you don't need it anymore you hung it up it's a rag and that's the way this old body is it's bore the image of the Heavenly yet it's not you you are on the inside of the body now I want you to catch this you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body and that what makes the outside come into subjections because the inside is pulling it bringing it in line with the word of God you're inside you yourself your being this body is just a coat now what did he put there when he says you the spirit of God now he he he he messed up there brother wend you I'm not the spirit of God did not you rotate off of God did not you are you not part of God are you not in the image of God are you not as Eternal as God you the spirit of God lives in that body amen now he says now someday what will you do with it amen for for you it was only a garment for a while this is what the Earthly garment this body your real body the real self is on the inside of this coat that you call William brandham or Susie Jones or whoever it is someday it will hang in Earth's Hall of memory of you and and you'll put it out yonder in the grave and somebody will put up a stone here lies Reverend so and so John so and so or so and so it'll lie there is a memorial of you but people just seen you in this a the people just seen you in this but and what you was the real you was on the inside well praise the Lord someone shout hallelujah hallelujah do we we don't put we don't put the respect Amen on this here because this here hallelujah now now you you Hallelujah someone shout hallelujah amen coming to church does not make you powerful amen amen and the preacher does not make you powerful H H singing in the choir preaching a sermon does not make you powerful we're we we're not going to we're not going to to to to uh amen give any advantage to anyone's person that person is death that person this person up here will die and go to the Grave the only thing that is powerful in you is the life of God that created You In His Image thank can you say Amen now that you always were even when you were a even when you were a a sinner you were still a Son of God even when you were were out there painting the town red you were a Son of God you always were a Son of God living in this Mortal body Hallelujah you don't become you always were you you're just as Eternal as God was if you believe this message brother Brandon would say you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in the flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are Sons we heard his voice we cried out as the prodigal save me oh my father I'm returning to thee a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son but the son is always who you were amen amen now there's a reason why I'm taking this this line of thought because it's the adoption of sons in this last day that has been promised and some people think that the adoption is something that you earn you never will earn adoption in this body right but the sun is simply coming to maturity to understand who he is and will bring this body under his control all right well glory to God I said glory to God it's the nature of the word that is living in within you Hallelujah well praise the Lord amen oh it's the nature it's it's the nature of the word it's it's the there there's it's the pulsating of it's who you really are that is on the inside it was there in SE form amen and yes it had to become energized but it was always there that's who you always were that's who you always will be right and the guy that does all of the fleshly works can work and work and outwork you and it'll never make him powerful before God for God respects no man's person he respects no man's house he respects no I don't care whether you claiming that your house is a mansion amen God does not respect your house amen you might be the most beautiful girl around amen you don't have to have any Cosmetics God does not respect your house amen you might be a a famous preacher amen that everyone else is oh my God does not respect the house God God respects the person on the inside of that house amen now that individual that come from God and is going back to God now it's the nature what is your nature it's all inside the seat of God Amen now those who are dominated by sin there it comes out out of their house amen it reflects out of their house they're they're Den they're dominated by sin amen they think about sinful things they do sinful things but those who have been born again and controlled by the spirit of God Amen the scripture says they're full of peace and they're full of joy and they're full of righteousness in the Holy Ghost can you say Amen that person that lives on the inside of well glory to God Amen I I I I always appreciate he man I I've I've you know I I um think about the the guy that that uh dad talks about uh uh Uncle Elden used to work for you used to work for this this this big trucking company and and and I believe it was Uncle L it might have been somebody else but amen and and a big big trunking company and so uh uh uh so whoever this was I believe it my uncle that that that pulled in and and they they backed it out you know and uh that they took the stuff out and and U uh he pulled back into the yard there and and there's this old man that there in that there in the in the in the trucky yard and he had his old overalls on hadn't shaved and he was just sitting out there on the docks or standing out there on the docks leaning against the building and and and and my uncle says hey Pops I'll give you five bucks if you go out there and clean out if you go out there and clean out my uh uh uh my trailer amen and so he said sure man five bucks I'll take it so he goes out there and he cleans the whole thing out and uh so when he's through he comes and he gives him his five bucks amen and some others that were standing around uh he they pull him off to the side and they said you're an idiot they said who you know who this is he's the owner of this whole thing amen he's the owner and you've just you paid him five bucks he signs your checks you see amen that man was he see he looked at him as a bomb standing out there when he was the owner and I just want to let the devil know you might think that there's a buom living in this house but within me is the owner and the possessor of all things and while you've got this world on a temporal hold I'm a Son of God I possess all all things though I'm living in this little mortal body you see Satan has always been the respector of persons he was respecting and lifting up the high priest when Jesus was on the earth and he was putting down Jesus amen Jesus he says oh you you're you're you're uh born of fornication amen you're an illegitimate child and they were always pointing to his person always pointing to that body always pointing to amen what you know when he would say destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up and and there he turns around they said how are you going to do this amen how are well can you say Amen Jesus says before Abraham was I am and they look and says hey come on you're not even over 30 years old or over 50 years old and here you are but you see they did not realize that the God of all glory was living in that house oh can you say Amen they were so into respecting the persons so into respecting the high priest and the positions of the Pharisees and the positions of the Sadducees and the positions of the scribes they were so into all of their Earthly positions that they did not recognize the Lord Of Glory was living right next door to them in a house can you say amen amen when Jesus was there and and and even his disciples as they were out there on the water and they they're about go all over the place and they Jesus is asleep and amen the god the god in that body wasn't a bit wasn't a bit worried amen God lived in that body and that body was peaceful Hallelujah but they finally wake Jesus up and says do you care lest we perish he said man the storms are taking us under and you're sleeping on us Jesus gets up and yawns and stretches for a minute and he says oh ye of little faith how long amen and he puts his foot on the brow of the bow of the ship and he says amen peace be still now that was spoken through this mtle decaying house brother bradam says the reason why they said you're not over 50 is because he looked like he was 50 he was he was old he was amen with all the the visions and all of the pressures and all of the things that he had gone through Amen in that mortal body he looked like he was an old man and there he was a young man amen but when he stood there it was the god of glory and what did the disciples say the disciples says what manner of man is this for even the winds and the waves obey him well I want to tell you he was more than just a man it was the God of all glory living in that man now I understand amen I understand that that that that within him he was the god Tabernacle in a physical body singular but I'm here to tell you today it is that great God since the pillar of fire separated himself on the day of Pentecost he is still giving a portion of himself and energizing your seed you are just as powerful because God lives in your house it was that being that Abraham or that that Adam was at the beginning living in an Earthly house brother bradam would put it this way he says now there's something that's wrong in the beginning God created you to master to be the master of every situation that's the origin that's authentic that's God's word there was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it that is what you were created for right but then Satan started pointing to the body Satan started pointing to the house Satan lured Eve away from the promise and started well glory to God Amen and then when mat brother Brandon would say and there is where man fell when he found how to recreate the body of man amen through the sexual but that was not the way God origin Ally intended now we're that does not change the fact that they're sons of God does not change the fact that you're decreed for every season it does not change the fact it's just that your house is now tainted it's wore out it's your mind is is measurable falling apart but within that house somebody say within my house my house is the holy spirit Spirit amen now I know some's going to say you're you're you're really bad I remember amen one time I was preaching and I said amen don't call me sinner call me Mrs Jesus Christ and and a man stopped amen and says listen you're going to always be a sinner amen you're going to always and you are don't put yourself up there with Jesus Christ amen I said I am the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ Christ took my shame that I could become his righteousness I am his bride I am am the reason he came in a house to begin [Applause] with now that's authentic that's in the fundamental foundation for Faith and that's a hard message to listen to because of the uh uh it's but I'm want to tell you there's not a there's a powerful message that Foundation that fundamental foundation for Faith and I would say it's worth amen turning it up and listening through all the screeches uh trying to understand and then read along with that because I'm telling you brother brandham gave some Secrets the entire message start to finish is like blow you away blow you away on what brother brandom is saying through a prophetic eye amen but then in in perfect Faith 1963 after the seals of being born he says now notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances now now I want you to understand remember this at the beginning God created you to master every circumstance that's the origin that's authentic that's God's word nothing can happen unless you were the master of it he said now something's wrong amen but now we come to perfect faith and he says perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it just watch when you believe anything do anything you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it it Masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness the Lord reveals that this certain thing's going to happen you speak it and you go on you're not judging the circumstances according to sight feel smell and hear and taste you are judging it by the inward mind of who you are well praise the Lord I said hallelujah amen do you realize that no matter what you are this Earth this this outside body and the circumstances I don't care if the rain is hitting it if the snow is hitting it if the Sunshine's hitting it amen I don't care if the wind's blowing against it the shingles are falling off and amen it needs to be painted and everything else amen that it does not affect the man that is on the inside of the house the man's on the inside of the house is the powerful one not the house I I'm going to keep on saying it the man on the inside of the house is the powerful one come on church amen and the Apostle Paul there in in the Book of Romans the8th chapter he says now we're not of the spirit or of the flesh but we are of the spirit we're not walking after the flesh we're walking according to the spirit he says if the spirit of Christ the the the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken it will Quicken your mortal bodies can you say amen amen there there Romans 8 and5 it says they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be now how does this peace come amen how does this life come it comes from a inward man who is satisfied with who they are now as I begin to try to bring my pieces together peace does not come by anything Earthly because this world is controlled by sin and death nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing you say h I just got promoted what promotion you talking about your house or the man living in the house with the promotion might come more money but it doesn't bring more peace it doesn't bring more happiness it doesn't bring anything like that so the promotions of this flesh does very little for you amen but the nature of the spirit within you Finds Its peace in him praise the Lord therefore you can stand as God stands and say Amen or as as the Apostle Paul amen as as as as that they had been 19 days I believe it was on the on the Seas and and the boat was falling apart and everyone was fixing to take their lives and Paul says fear not take not your life we're all here everything's okay amen for the god whom I serve has visited me last night and told me that everything's going to be okayu told me everything everything going to be okay and they're all said well who are you he says no no no no listen to me amen if you you're going to have to cut the lifeboats off cut them all off amen the ship is going to sink that is that is true but I'm here to tell you if you stick with me amen there shall not one of us be lost all right there shall not one because the god whom I serve sent an angel to me last night and told me that worked well praise the Lord what was he saying oh yes this this thing here goes back and forth but I've Got Confidence in my god I've Got Confidence well can you say amen amen you see words in themselves have no value amen anyone can confess the words of God anyone can confess it but it's not just not just the words that's being said it's it's the sons of God it's the person that lives in your house that is speaking those words that makes those those words come to pass right amen now they they're in James James told us amen James says that you can't tame that tongue that tongue will not be tamed it's it's it's it's it's going to say what it wants to it's going to do well praise the Lord amen and James says and it's because of the inside amen the fountain wherever the fountain is it you can't have good water and bad water coming out of it at the same time and if we've got the power of the Holy Spirit within us it is to dictate what we think what we say how we react in every situation of Our Lives well come on church amen yes there is another law on the inside of you I understand that that's your spirit man it's the nature of the flesh that's how you think that's how you that's how that that's how amen you live in this body can function but I will say that the soul of man is where the god of Glory that Eternal Jean seed that rotated off of God lives and there's where there's where the authority comes from amen we we preached here we've taken a few services on that confession he's the high priest he's the Apostle and the high priest of our confession the Apostle is the one the originator it's the one that that brought the confession together in the first place and now then he is the high priest of that confession amen he is interceding that the word of God can come forth so he is the Apostle and the high priest the apostle was the originator he is the he is the author and the finisher of our faith if you want to just bring it into our terms amen the author and the finisher he is the he is the he he he is the Apostle the originator the anointed one of God that got you started and he will be that amen faithful high priest to the things of God concerning you and will take you to your finished line confession where is that confession you are brother bradam would say you are there are two omnipotence Hallelujah we want to put God as being the only omnipotent brother Brandon says that's not correct he says you are are omnipotent because you came from God Amen he says so when God the omnipotent and the son the omnipotent comes together and confessing what God has said he said nothing will stand in that man's way Hallelujah is that right amen that's right brother Joe sent something uh uh uh yesterday and and went along with what I was preaching here this morning so uh I I appreciate him putting that on there amen the devil has no power over you but he wants to get you to doubt who you are amen and so when he does he starts he starts putting in these these thoughts and he starts putting this in there and your words and before you know it amen you're bringing the curse on yourself because you are a son of God and your words matter that's right someone say I'm a son I'm a son and my words matter you can bring a curse upon you by not speaking the way God says to speak by not believing the way God Satan has no power over you unless you give it to him but you are you have peace and righteousness amen by the blood of Jesus Christ by that new birth that is within you can you say Amen now Jesus would say there in in Matthew 12 and 33 he says either make the tree good his fruit good or else make the tree corupt and his fruit corrup for the tree is known by his fruit oh Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things so Jesus is putting it here it's all starts with who you are are on the inside right an evil man from an evil heart brings out evil things and the seed of God from the very life of God speaks the words of God and brings peace can you say Amen now now now watch this the very next words and Jesus but uh 36th verse but I say unto you that every Idol word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned oh no no no brother when no you I come to church every not that he respects nobody's person remember he's not a respector of persons we he said now you guys respect persons you bring the rich and the poor and all that that God says that that don't work with me now now now what I'm talking about is the guy that's living on the inside now let's talk about that because you're powerful not by the house you're powerful because of what lives inside that house yes amen amen well praise the Lord God don't want you being religious God wants you to be powerful God's not created you to look pretty God's created you to be powerful God's not created you to have your name on a roll somewhere he's created you to be powerful can you say Amen I've always told the boys I don't care where you work what you do you're powerful it don't matter it's not it's not a bad deal to work underneath somebody it's not a bad deal to be to be the boss it does it does not matter amen your rank yes it might help you a little bit with your money Amen on on on on what you on what you make and things of that nature but that does not determine who you are you're powerful because of what God created in you before the foundation of the world can you say Amen right brother bradam says you want all power he says you want you want me to show you how to be powerful he said you think powerful is running up and down the aisles he me in dancing he said I say power is that something on the inside of a man that'll control his tongue that'll control his thoughts that'll control him himself he says that is power amen yes what's he talking about because in you lives the all powerful one can you say Amen Now power is within you and the authority comes out of you the power is the Eternal God within you you're not powerful but you've been given the authority to speak what that word of the Eternal God has placed so when he says now when a when a mortal man take the Divine words upon human lips he says that is the same thing as deity itself speaking for it is God in that man well Glory teach my words teach my mouth teach me Lord Ecclesiastes 12:9 moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yay he gave good heed and sought out and said in order many Proverbs the preacher sought to accept or to find out acceptable words that was written and that which was written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise are as Golds and nails and As Nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which which are given from one Shepherd can you say Amen gold what what is what what is a cattle prod gold get you right where you need to be and there also was Nails that'll keep you anchored can you say Amen now as I get ready to close brother brandom when he's talking talking about the position of the believer in Christ and that is the that is the title that I'm of the of the sermon that I'm quoting from the position of a believer in Christ and so brother brother bradam is talking about position he's talking about Authority he's talking about sunship and he's given the reason as to why sons of God can go through life powerless Hallelujah you say a Son of God can go through life powerless yeah yeah yeah if he's going to put all of his attention on the house instead of the person in the house Hallelujah I'm here to tell you your house is you know pretty cute out on those on those pews but those houses mean nothing to God all right now he says now now the whole earth the whole room here is full of the power of God enough to make this boy sitting here in this wheelchair walk make this woman walk make this lady in the stretcher walk make all these people along here walk make the blind to see but the first things you have to do is get the Holy Spirit flowing in the right category do you believe it it's here what if you had an artisian well over on this mountain and a crop burning up over on this mountain and you sit there hollering and and and you hollering oh you great gusher water gushing water you great gushing water go over there and water my crops oh you great gushing water go over there and water my crop you'll make yourself horse and it will never move all right you can scream you can cry you can shout you can run you could speak in tongues you can jump up and down you could sing songs you could preach the gospel but until you work in harmony with the Holy Ghost you'll make yourself horse and get nowhere amen so now now now he's saying in the room on the on wait the problem is not the glory of the Lord on the earth the glory of the Lord is on the earth as he's promised the glory of the Lord is to cover the Earth as the water covers the sea amen it's this is it this is this is it we're we're in the glory of the Lord you say this don't look gloryful to me this is the greatest time brother brandom says if I were if I were to pick any age if I had my choice of any age Jesus on Earth and then all the Seven Ages I would pick this day because this is the most glorious time this is the coming of the Perfection of the Bride this is the rapturing of the church and he said the church will be more powerful in this day well dear God I don't see it it's here it's already been demonstrated through the pillar of fire that was over brother bram's head and brother brandham declared him to be here we know he's here to many of us put it on that house that Kentucky house too many put it on that Kentucky house so God died whenever the house went died I I we can't respect we God does not put any kind of a Glory thank God for the call thank God for the gift thank God for the house it was what God used to show himself and reveal himself through amen yeah but you and I are here we've got all the glory of the Lord on this mountain and crops burning up on this mountain brother Brandon would say now you've got something to do amen he said that water will water this crop if you'll work with the correct laws of gravity it'll pull that water right around there and water that crop if you'll work according to the laws of gravity that water will run but you can't jump it over there the Holy Ghost will heal every person in here if you work according to the plan and will of the Holy scriptures there's enough Christians in this city today even Christians in this building here to close the heavens o over Phoenix but you've got to work according to the will of the spirit can you say Amen now brother bradam would say he said I I I stood and a meeting one night and I heard an evangelist praying for for a sick person and he said God I command you to heal this person who command God see it isn't it isn't it it's isn't even intelligent because that God he does what he wants to are are you hearing me so he is saying you're not demanding God but you're coming in line with with the law of God so some people's demanding God you got it God you got it God you got it brother bram's already told us he's already healed us he's already delivered he's already done that stuff now we've got right we're Sons we're Sons we are to operate amen and Rule and reign with that word can't command God you ain't going to do nothing like that no sir but we're lining up with God it is God's will to heal it is God's will to deliver it is God's will to bring happiness and peace well praise the Lord hallelujah how you know what I'm going to do I'm going to quit looking at God as if amen he that he's limited to the house I say right now God is living in this house Holy Spirit flow through me live through me heal through me can you say Amen yes good the real you step forward now I know you're pretty and I know you're goodlooking and I and I and I I I appreciate you coming to church this morning Hallelujah but the real you is more powerful than Beauty could ever give it's more powerful than any status can ever give the unlimited God lives and a abides within you shout yet Hallelujah the glory of the Lord yes yes Hallelujah this old coat that we're wearing amen it's going to be put down but on the inside you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body Hallelujah do you love him amen yeah if the musicians would come amen he says there to be a son you had to be in gene form the only way you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to have to be that to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life the spirit life tonight that was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation someone say manifestation manifestation how are you being manifest you could not be manifest except through a body and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed some someone say now I'm expressed I'm expressed living in that old body and and and the world's looking and saying H look at that Shack that can't be God but God lives in the shack God lives in the shack oh hallelujah oh come on now well they're not even known by anywhere they're not even known by this one or that they're not known it don't matter the God of all glory lives in that Jack [Applause] I when looking over my notes I came across I came across another one and and um I I I don't even I don't even know where where it's at and I think I put it in here but uh but brother brandham he he's he's he's talking about amen the the Holy Ghost and he says now and and and I'll bring it tonight just read it to you because it it sounds totally out there he says the Holy Ghost is a temporal gift he said your soul is the real gift baptism of the Holy Ghost is a temporal gift and your soul is the real gift and [Music] and then he goes on to explain it says it's the soul the genan seed of God that the Holy Spirit comes upon the spirit is falling upon All Flesh the guy next to you might not have the soul the genan seed of God the image of God but the Holy Ghost is causing him to jump causing him to act making him religious that's a temporal gift for that man what he's missing is the soul with the gerti seed so the spirit is falling upon the just and the unjust but I'm so thankful for God's seed on the inside that has been energized it's not a temporal gift for the believer because he has a soul in the image of [Music] God we're not we're we're we're what I'm saying is temporal see what I'm saying is is we're living in a lot of craziness where these these bodies come temporal to church and the spirit falls on bodies and people say woo and then they go to the next meeting and they bring their they bring their houses and the rain falls on the house and they shout and speak in tongues and they ha but God respects no persons it's the same Holy Ghost but power is not what's falling on the roof of the house power is the man living in the house power is the Holy Ghost germinated seed on the inside of you you're powerful and you ain't powerful because you feel like you are you're powerful because the genetics of God on the inside of you yes [Music] now my thoughts this morning is this if you're looking in the
