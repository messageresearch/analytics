everyone uh had a hopefully he had a little bit of a nap or something and um amen we um sure appreciate all of our our sisters and the and the work that they do and and so uh when they when they take off on these uh however long it is fifth or sixth Sundays uh we you know it makes you makes you think about them and and um just want every one of you ladies to know that that we love every one of you and thank you for all of your love to our families your husbands your children the church amen we truly do love you and appreciate you can the church say Amen to that amen amen let's look here in James the 5th chapter and the 14th verse and um this is a familiar passage of scripture and we're going to maybe continue on a little bit on expectation tonight and um um we'll see how far uh we get along I um man we're um I've just learned a long time ago when the devil starts raring up his head I um Hallelujah I'm still a fighter and we're all fighters and we're just we just have to resist that clown he wants to try to get you to turn around and I preached on expectation this morning and I'm going to preach on expectation again tonight but um so um I've I've had um my my stomach's just been a little upset these last few weeks and and um it's not sickness I don't uh but you know it's happened three or four times where it just it gets you know my stomach just gets really sour and um and so Hallelujah and but uh but we're Overcomers and um and so he just picked the wrong day to do that this evening so I'm only saying that because somebody had prayed for us tonight and so I just thought I'd let you know I'm not dying I'm just uh amen but if I end quickly or uh amen praise the Lord all right James 5 and 14 um 13 is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any married let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord the prayer of faith shall save the sick the Lord shall raise him up and if he ha committed any sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much El Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit amen can you say Amen to that let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your love today thank you you for your such Bountiful blessings to us and Lord we come with expectation tonight to see you and we're asking Lord that you would just be in everything that is done and said pray Lord that you would father just um let your angels be among us here tonight we give ourselves to you now in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen amen God bless you you may be seated under expectation man for the supernatural I begin to think as I have have prepared um sometimes the greatest Miracles come amen out of desperation lots of times the greatest Miracles come most of the time I must say that the greatest Miracles are are when there are uh when when you are getting desperate it seems like desperation clears the air for us to see what's really important amen many of times we don't really we get caught up in the Affairs of life and we get we we get to a point to where we get little too self-sufficient and as we get self-sufficient we lose sight of the supernatural amen and so and that's and that's been that's been the that's that's been the cycle of of generations you look at all through the Old Testament amen there was the cycle of death and Revival death and Revival it was a it was a cycle that went amen um uh the God would send Revival and then they would then they would be on the mountain for a while then they would go back down and then God would have to get them in Des eration and then and and and things would would come and so amen of course we're we're living in the in the uh New Covenant but with the New Covenant we're we we we we've got more of a stability our stability is found in that new birth amen they didn't have the new birth in the old Covenant so amen they were still dealing with their they were under the law of sin and death amen so a prophet would come bring them back in line with the word of God and then amen uh they would they would stand there and repent and say I will not do it again and I'm going to serve God and then after a while they would begin to Veer back off and amen and and and then uh go into sin and captivity and then desperation and so amen but we're living under a new the the new law it's the law of life that is found in Christ Jesus our lord amen this this new law is a law that that overcomes sin and death amen they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost back in the old Covenant but you have been washed not by the blood of bulls and goats but you have been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ God's perfect sacrifice amen and so when you've got God God's perfect sacrifice and the Holy Spirit comes back upon you that brings about an eternal quality to the elect you've got there is an eternal quality and brother Brandon that's actually a quote amen that it brings about an eternal quality that lays within you and so though we don't I don't believe there should be backslidings and going out in sinning but amen and and I I think that once we're set free from alcohol we never have to go back or once we're set free from drugs we never have to go back when we're set free from from from uh um uh uh you know any kind of a sin whether it be uh uh hate or malice or whatever we don't have to go back I believe what God does he does perfect I believe the loosing when God looses you through his blood the prophet said it is a perfect loosing you can stand stand in freedom but you're still living in this flesh amen now you're not under the law of sin and death amen you're under the law of life in Christ Jesus but that does not take away amen sicknesses that the devil tries to throw on you amen a depression that the devil tries and he'll he'll try to bring these things in and and and and even get you busy with family life not necessarily sin per se but to get you out on the way from expectation of walking in that Supernatural realm amen but this is where we've got to understand that when we're walking in this super or when we're walking in this flesh we are not walking in the flesh but we're walking in the spirit the Apostle Paul says now amen we once lived and we once walked after the flesh but we are now walking after the LA law of life that is found in Christ Jesus can you say Amen so as we're walking in the law of life we're living in the law of life we we we greet one another in the flesh we go to work in this flesh we cook supper in this flesh we we raise our children in this flesh but we're living according to the law of life in Christ Jesus and that's where the expectation comes from the expectation does not come from this yes it does not come from your nature it comes from that soul that has received a new birth amen and so amen many of times God brings about and allows situations to come in the natural so that we can see God real in the Supernatural amen one of the one of the greatest things that we could amen uh see and if you wanted to turn there here tonight o over in the book of 2 Chronicles and the 20th chapter I've always loved this uh uh passage of of of scripture Austin um was was admiring my uh this these Pages here amen earlier in the office and and talking about all the different colors and everything and and uh amen but a lot of it is is uh I've preached from this subject a lot over the years and so I've highlighted different portions and re highlighted different pors as we're as we're going through it but this is this is quite a uh a testimony of of natural people and how that the supernatural came and was involved I I believe we're serving a supernatural God folks and and this Supernatural God has not wanted just to want want to just be here in church on Sunday morning and Sunday night God wants to live with you and walk with you God's interested in what you're going through and I know I know I I I know that sometimes that amen things are prolonged sicknesses are prolonged uh uh um uh you know pains are prolonged but I'm here to tell you amen after a while that Soul begins to kick in and Desperation begins to kick in and say God I'm going to sit right here until I see the supernatural in my life I I tell you it's one of the greatest things amen it was one of the greatest things it it's it's it's in it it's it's something to say what God done to bring us out of the world but in this journey going over and children of Israel was right there at the Red Sea it was the Red Sea that looked so impossible and looked like there was no hope and no way to come through that God came through and showed himself real can you imagine amen they weren't walking through slime and and and and and and M they they walked across on dry Ground God supernaturally but you see it took a group of people that were sitting there in in in in desperation saying God if you don't come on the scene I'm going to die my children are going to die we're going to we're going to fall amen but God can oh Hallelujah you know what God Said Moses why you crying unto me I've already delivered you why don't you just speak to the people and go across Moses is saying now wait a minute have you have you have you have you seen the Red Sea he says speak and go across and when he spoke the waters parted God performed the supernatural so is God showing himself real amen coming in the natural realm to show us who he is amen now if if you were to Amen to look there in this 2 Chronicles the 20th chapter amen the children of Moab are are are in trouble and the children or the children of Moab and the children of Ammon have have come to war against Jehoshaphat amen and if you were to read and I'd like to just read read just take a little bit of time tonight and read some of this amen and and if you just start at the first verse and it came to pass that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon with them other besides the children of ammonites uh come against the Jehoshaphat to battle And Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat uh saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the seed on this side see on this side of Syria and behold they be in uh whatever that word is which is in ingod and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they come to seek the Lord amen so so desperation begins to create a hunger how many knows that when you're when when the desperation begins to come or when things The Impossible begins to come amen that that that that's when you really begin to call on the Lord you call on the Lord when things are a little amen when when there are are situations that you just can't get around amen but you see when they didn't know what to do Jehoshaphat being a Godly King he got all of Judah together and he says we are going together in prayer and we're going to call unto the Lord amen and the scripture says that he set himself third verse when he feared he set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all of Judah and then Judah gathered together now the fifth verse it says Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court now I want you to understand this I want you to I want you to just see the heart of Jehoshaphat because whatever he done he got God's attention and and he and he says that amen the sixth verse and and said oh Lord God of our fathers art thou God are not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of of the heaven of the Heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art thou AR not thou God who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gavest it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying now there's a godly man that is calling on the name of the Lord if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry in our Affliction when thou wil hear and help and when and now that behold the children of the Ammon and Moab and mount seir whom thou uh wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt they turned uh but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou Hast given to us uh given us to inherit now what is he doing he is remind when he's praying he's not praying his problem he is praying God's word he is reminding God you gave the promise he's living in the natural but he's reminding god of the Supernatural That's Right he is saying you're the one that gave the promise now I I I want you to really look at that because some of you may be looking at an enemy that is trying to kill you amen maybe physically maybe spiritually amen maybe maybe trying to take one of your children and and you're not going to be able to to win in the natural amen he didn't call all the guys together with the swords and the Spears and he didn't call all the Army together he called the church together and called them into prayer desperation caused them to reach out to the one who had called them at the beginning oh glory be to the Lamb of God I believe God is honored amen when we we when we come to him we knew one thing Judah knew one thing that they were of the Seed of Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies and stood in Solomon's Temple he stood right right there and he said you promised that you would hear our prayers you promised when Solomon built this that if we should call upon your name you would hear Oh Glory to God you see God cannot lie so if you put your trust in God's word that's an anchor that's an anchor in your storm God can not lie that's right God can roll back the Seas God can create amen the Stars God can create Heavens God created the Earth God can do anything but God can not lie it that's one thing that God can't do he can't tell a lie he can't tell a lie amen so when God says something when you're in your storm when you're going in your and you're in the Whirlwind and and maybe the tornadoes coming near you God's word should be your anchor it should be your tornado shelter it should be your bomb shelter because God's word can not fail a natural people expecting the supernatural God that's right now now it's not just the figment of your imagination you can't go up to God and say all right I'm expecting Supernatural help amen Trump can't go up to God and expect super Supernatural help amen Biden can't go up to God unless he's unless they're the elect is that right but when God calls you and God ordained you just like Israel you gave us this land you sent us here you said you would fight our battle you said that when the enemy comes in and if we would come to this Temple you would hear from Heaven that that that word was all all they needed to hear amen that word was all they oh Church of God if you could put your confidence in the word of God Allelujah that's the reason I say I don't care about the big name preacher here and I don't really care about all the opinions in the message amen God gave us a clearcut message he gave it to us through that seventh angel and it doesn't matter what anyone else says it really doesn't matter what you say it don't matter what I say it don't matter what amen what a a preacher says there is one absolute and that's God's word and that's what that Prophet brought us back too is the absolute of God's brother I'm here to tell you heavens and earth are going to pass away but you can depend on the word the enemy is going to come it's going to go it's going to come one way and it's going to flee seven ways because God's word is our absolute we're depending on that can you say Amen now God loves to test his people amen lots of times you're in trouble amen M it's not because you backslid many times you get in trouble because God's testing you and God's wanting to show you amen the strength of that Supernatural seed on the inside of you amen he wants to he already knows what he's got on the inside of you he wants you to know what you got on the inside of you he already knows what he's put him there amen well he knew Abraham he knew Abraham was going to make it but he tested Abraham's Faith well I want to say tonight I'm so glad that God has confidence in his people to test his people I'm glad that amen that he was proud of joob I'm I I'm glad to read that in the Bible where the Bible says amen where where God told Satan he says have you tried my servant joob he's perfect and just and amen there is none like him in all of the Earth and amen these you I'm going to tell you he ain't going to fail Satan says oh yes he will I'm glad to hear God brag on me and I say when you're in the trial and Satan's coming against you why don't you just lift up your head lift up your hands and say God is bragging on me God's bringing me to this point to show his work in me I am expecting the supernatural God in my life amen I'm in this trial because God ordained it amen God's sending me through it God's allowing it and I am expecting God to move in a supernatural way that's right amen can you say Amen now whether it's the fiery furnace or the Lion's Den or the am man or the Red Sea or whatever you want to look at here tonight amen no matter what you want to look at the Supernatural is always there God puts you in a natural situation to reveal the supernatural in your presence amen what it is is amen though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou somebody say thou art with me right thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou you see what it does is it separates the men from the boys it separates amen the wannabes from the real the church member from the true me uh true uh uh elect can you say Amen so God loves to test now as we have read here amen Jehoshaphat he was afraid but he feared but he set himself to seek the Lord now I I think about Jeremiah the 31st chapter in the 9th verse and it says and they shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them and and I I I think that sometimes we we we we think that that's means it's going to be just a lot of Sorrow I don't really look at it in that way I I I there's going to be sorrow involved man but there's going there there there's going to be the situations that you're going to be in in your lifetime that you're going to need God and the way that you fight is going to be on your knees the way you fight is going to be a desperate prayer before God we we we we've got too much where it's just a little lay me down to bed uh prayer it's it's just a little it's just a the prayer meetings aren't really prayer meetings anymore it's just saying a few a few dry words but God wants us to come into the supernatural realm and the supernatural realm is going to require amen it's going to require a battle and the way you fight the way you fight is by desperation and I'm sorry but there's very very few times where tears are not part of desperation there's very few times that you're calling Amen to God and just with a dry eye with respiration but there's something that is wrenching your gut whether it's over child or amen a a wayward loved one or a job or or whatever and and and and and and it just seems like you're being squeezed it seems like the enemy is is is really hitting you hard and the sad thing is amen many of times according to what God uh told as David said he says my very own friends have persecuted me my very own amen those that are the closest to me when Jesus was standing there he says in the the house of my friends did I receive these scars uh uh receive these wounds you see God allowed those things to take place it was it was uh it was it was Joseph's very own Kindred amen that were jealous of him and persecuted him and sold him but you see every one of these things amen it was for the supernatural to to be expressed be expressed in and through them oh can you say Amen you see it takes those things it takes the agony it takes those things to to come and amen and and and and and it and and it and it hurts and it causes the friction on the inside it causes the headaches it causes the sleepless nights it causes those things but I want you to know when you're looking unto him the one who gave the promise and you place your heart upon him the one who said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll love you with an everlasting love then you can know amen that the great Shepherd is with me while in the valley and I will come forth you can put your confidence in that word you got to get desperate and sometimes desperation comes sometimes am man as as we were to finish reading they shall come with weeping and supplication will I lead them and I will cause them to walk by the rivers of water in a straight way and wherein they shall not stumble but it requires it requires the uncomfortable situation that God puts us in in as as his sons and his daughters are you understanding what I'm saying he puts us in these situations because He is wanting to show himself strong and I I I want to tell you amen Joseph Joseph is a man that has been proven by God that God was with him Joseph was one Moses was one these Great Men the three Hebrew children all down through scripture it took these pressure to bring about that desperation and that desperation created weeping and supplications and that caused them to walk by the rivers of water in a straight way wherein they would not stumble supplication in the English it means a humble sincere appeal it means an urgent request to somebody who has the power to Grant a request now I I want you to think about that because amen it's an urgent request to somebody Allelujah we know that there ain't nobody you can't pick yourself up by your bootstraps and there's no one here on the earth that can pick you up so you're looking unto God who has all power Amen to Grant your request in the Hebrew it means to seek favor to implore to beg plead for favor brother Bram would say when you get desperate about this thing times something will or get desperate about this saying something will take place you're not desperate enough oh well I join the church and that settles it but you be desperate about it you have to really need God Jesus said blessed are they that that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but as long as you're satisfied hear me now as long as you're satisfied with the things of this world how can God ever speak to you you say God's never spoke to me why he wants to but you're too filled up with the things of the world see so that's why God puts us in those situations s that are uncomfortable that's why God allows things to happen sometimes in family sometimes in job sometimes in school sometimes amen uh between husband and wife God allows things that if we will reach out after him it will bring him into this realm Hallelujah when you're getting sick and amen the enemy is coming in and he's and he's and he's trying to get you to you know uh uh uh stay home from church or trying to get you to worry about amen this or that and you can just stand right there and say you know what I've got something greater than this situation God has allowed this situation I'm I'm here to tell you I I know the flu might run around I know that amen Co ran its course I I know that there's a lot but I'm here to tell you I I I ain't going to get it unless God knows that I'm going to get it first and if God allows me to go through that Valley then God's given me the assurance that I'm coming out of the valley if God has allowed me to go through sickness go through cancer go through whatever you want to fill in then I've got a promise that he is my healer he is my deliverer can you say Amen so what he does he brings things our way so that we can get rid of a lot of junk in our lives true Hallelujah junk God don't want you putting the junk in storage God want you to get rid of the junk amen don't don't don't he's Wan you to get rid of the clutter in your life not not at another storage building Hallelujah he wants us he wants us to to come to where it is nothing but him that we desire now it was it took Moses that was 40 years in that Wilderness it took that as I said earlier this morning Moses had got to the point he didn't think it was possible Moses didn't gave up on the idea Moses wasn't going want to have it he just brother brandom says he totally forgot about it he just Hallelujah and that was about the time that God shows up and says all right now I can do something with you right because now and then he's over there saying I stutter too much I can't I oh glory to God what was it it was God getting him to a point to where he would rely wholly and totally upon that Supernatural Rim can you amen amen now now he says he says uh uh he we uh we find out that Isaiah Isaiah got desperate and he screamed out and confessed his sins confessed the sins of his people and when he got through confessing he heard a noise up above him and he looked up and there was a chair there were cherums flying back and forth through the building Wings over their faces Wings over their feet flying with wings crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty something was taking place Isaiah got desperate God come on the job can you say am man so so God when he got desperate God come on the job I like I just love the way that our Prophet talks he says now when he came and he seen and he confessed and then he saw the Supernatural and then he knew that God come on the job he was ready to do do something can you say man it reminded me as I as I read that it it reminded me of of this quote too I I've Loved this quote over the years he said Paul Paul said none of these things bother me for he was tied to an absolute Christ every true achievement is tied to an absolute and my absolute is the word and everybody else that's really born of the spirit of God their absolute is God's word I'm tied to it I laid my hands upon it it took my place I've identified myself with him we we knew that he promised to identify himself with us and that brings that genuine faith not your own faith but his faith something that you don't control he does it can you say amen he says then and only then is the promise made to you now I want us to as we look at at this chapter now we can see amen that they have no power now that 12th verse he says oh God man he he he says Thou will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee and all of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones with their wives with their children isn't that just beautiful Hallelujah when desperation comes bring the whole family bring it all bring them all in and say guys I want y'all to see what God is fixing to do God's fixing to do a miracle then if you would read from down from the 14th chapter man and and down to the 17th chapter then God comes upon a prophet a haziel or je uh jezel amen and and and it in the 15th verse he he says hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem Thou King of Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord oh Hallelujah Be not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff z z and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeruel now I I I I just I just want to stop here for a moment and say you know there's a lot of lot of talk in the land right now about gifts and uh some's asked me what side do you follow I believe in the all nine spirits gifts I believe every Son of God will believe in all nine spiritual gifts I believe that if God's got a gift Among Us and there's Visions or interpretations prophecies tongues and interpretations I believe they're going to be accurate I believe the supernatural wants to speak to and through the people I believe that if God can do this take a just a just a minor prophet here under under the Bulls of goat bulls and goats and can come and tell them exactly where the enemy is going to be and how to defeat it God's big enough to do that again today but I don't believe in I I I don't believe in this vague prophecy thing this vague where where it could come to pass or well it will come to pass because there's really not a way for it not to come to pass I've got a problem with it yes sir I've seen a lot of that in the in the nonsense I came out of God's got a bride the prophet said there's going to be the nine spiritual gifts in this bride I believe it's going to be here I believe that it is here but there's going to be sons and daughters that know how to use it we're not just going to be blabbing come on and we're not going to be giving vague predictions if God wants to tell us hey go down to clicks tomorrow morning at at 10:00 because there's a guy down there that's going to need salvation and the Holy Spirit has said that and and the Lord is and and and he's moved upon me to tell Kobe that he's going to lead somebody to the Lord then Kobe can go down there at clicks tomorrow morning at 10:00 amen and and and find the man there lead the man to the Lord because God is spoken amen we don't need no guessing and God don't need you guessing God's big enough to talk and if he wants to talk he can be precise that's can you say Amen so true I think we need to I think we need to not just takeen every little thing that comes through and and and you know there and and and and listen I just want to make my stand for right here where I stand and let let you all know where I stand I am not against the tongues and I'm not against the prophecy and I'm not against visions and dreams but I don't want to ever go back to Pentecost the the denominational Pentecost I came out of God wants to speak he can speak and I and and and brother brandham says and when he speaks and when those when those gifts are in the church it will bring fear among the whole congregation well glory to God so God is a why not expect you say well well no one can be that accurate well then shut up and quit prophesying but if you know that it has been a promise that has been given in this day how many believes that it is a promise then I can expect the supernatural gifts running through our little church right here I believe we can expect God to speak in tongues I believe we can expect God to to uh to to uh have prophecy the Apostle Paul I mean he dedicated three chapters to it there in the book of Corinthians he believed in it brother Bradon believed in it but we want the original I want my expectation of the super I don't want Hallelujah God's still using humans God's still speaking through humans but it's still the supernatural voice of God well can you say Amen you see desperation I believe there should be a desperation to see those gifts to see those gifts in operation in the church that's right there should be those desperation for God to move but I'm not seeking gifts I'm not following hallelujah amen I I I've seen too many of gifted men that really you and they were gifted someone said well you know I I someone made a comparison to me to a spiritual man here one time I said well you know that guy over there man he's the Lord speaks to him all the time and uh I said well not all the time time he speaks to him lots of the time but he's hitting his mest well you know you don't really you know I mean you're a good preacher and all but I I I just figured you'd be I said well who who's telling you that God don't ever speak to me what right you see I'm not using a gift to make anyone fear me or follow me we don't use gifts to put ourselves on pestal that's right that's right you watch those men that are constantly making people fear them because they're gifted and can see in their lives that's a shame right but you see it's it's these it's these genuine gifts of God and I know the man was you know he missed it half the time maybe more than that can you say Amen well you can't say Amen to that but you agree that you want to hear you you want something to be real when you're in desperation you need to hear from God Amen but God ain't want you in your desperation Amen to call up uh uh this brother so and so because he's using the gifts all the time I got to get to him matter of fact I I mean I just got to tell you amen I praise the Lord I I I I remember uh h a man calling me up and said brother window you and I've have got to fast and pray I'm coming up I'm coming to Pony and we're going to fast and pray for a week and I'm I'm said we are he goes yes yes I'm Dem I need help and and I I want to come up to here I know you know how to pray and I want you to fast and pray with me for a week and and he says and then we got to get a hold of uh brother so and so because he's gifted and so and and we got to get him cuz then we'll hear from the Lord I said well why why do you need to hear from him and he he said well I don't know if anyone else has got that's gifted like that and and Hallelujah you see that's way Pentecost that's way we were in Pentecost we had to have someone constantly prophesying over us constantly having a vision about us constantly saying a word over us and it got to the point where we didn't even have to have it from the Lord just long as the pastor was saying something nice about us amen hallelujah see you over there struggling and I'm praying for you woo thank you Jesus that was just Hallelujah we want the Supernatural and we can expect the Supernatural That's right brother I want God in there I want God right here I've done I've been telling well it's all it's already the in the 1 of March amen but I've been saying it all year let this be the year where mountains are thrown into the sea let this be the year that that Giants fall let this be the year of the supernatural in the church let this be the year where the congregation is rising up under the power and the demonstration of the supernatural in our midst can you say Amen jeos Jehoshaphat this was a spiritual group of people they knew that God was going to be the one doing it they weren't following and seeking the gifts they were seeking God who gave the promise and then a prophet Rises up among them and tells them hey the enemy is going to be over here and you're going to see this and and and and he's and he's and he's telling the 15th verse he you know he he he's saying that a man Be not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multiply for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the Cliff of zys and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeru and you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand still see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out of against them for the Lord will be with you well glory to God so now so we're finding that there can be gifts and these gifts when they're operating am man it's going to be God Among Us we don't want no humanism among us we don't want no good impersonations you know what brother brandom says he says if you miss it once he says you need to repent because you have lied he says you've got to get that lying devil off of you don't say that brother wend we're trying to get speakers in tongues we're trying to get prophesizes you're going to have everyone listen the Holy Spirit can come on you and he can overtake your body and he can speak thus saith the Lord yes now we're not a prophet we're not a word Prophet but God does have have prophets prophets Minor Prophets not correcting the prophet but God can prophesy prophetesses God can God can have women as prophetesses he can have boys and girls as prophesied come on we read we we read back there uh uh you guys that remember what I was reading about brother sharan's family and how God moved upon an 11-year-old boy and told him and they got up and and and and prophesied that that persecution is coming and to leave uh whatever land they were in and to head and to head to the United States or or to head they didn't even he didn't know what the United States was y y' y y y'all were here on that Wednesday night y'all remember that it was 11year old boy that had stood up and saved and and the few that went with them that that that listened to him now it was it was a few years later amen it was as a matter of fact the boy was no he was now a young man I believe in his 20s and and then he had came up and the spirit of the Lord come back upon him again and says it's coming we've got to be ready and and then uh and we find out uh that that the family that that was the the the grandfather of brother shakaryan would have been slaughtered if he would have stayed there so God hallelujah knew that brother shakarian was going to have to send brother brandom around the world and so he he protected the seed of of brother shakarian brought him over to the United States and of course we know the history the Full Gospel businessmen and all of that and but that was all prophesied by a child right a boy that knows nothing about anything now if God can use a donkey God can use anybody well praise the Lord but desperation is Lord anybody can play music pretty good or good musicians can play music pretty good good song leaders can lead songs pretty good and not have a lick of anointing a good preacher can get up and make a good speech and not have a bit of anointing you can have everything going on in a church and not require any anointing where it's all just a bunch of it's just just a political Affair just a we don't want just a a we don't want just a a a human Lodge we want this to be the place for the Holy Spirit we want this to be the place where our babies God can fall on our babies and rise up and say hey the enem is going to come against you tomorrow well come on brother Ram donees said it he says they'll rise up and someone will rise up and say brother I give you your crops I send water oh he says in a dry and Barren land and the sun has has has taken it all and amen and everything and he says and a man will rise up in the church and will say brother I give you your water for your crops and God will come down and and and and and and bring Deliverance well I I I just want to say amen I I I believe we can see that I believe we should see that but it will only come when we're desperate for the supernatural amen it will only come when we are willing to set us and our children and our wives and our little ones all before God and say I want the supernatural God in our midst amen now you say can that happen today there has never been a day like this day never been a day it's not coming Maria it's not coming it's here amen it's not coming it is here amen the only thing we're waiting on is the coming of the Lord and the brother brandham says what we this church will be the finality of this church will be glorious [Applause] I'm expecting Sister Amy yes how that song goes I'm expecting amen anticipating a move of God Amen a move of God I'm going to bring every one of those Devils under my control I'm going to bring every one of you say well what you know amen you're saying me and I and all that well what I can do I'm going to do and I can I can I can create an atmosphere that's one thing I can in this body there's one thing I can is watch what these eyes are looking to and watch what these ears are listening to and watch I can do that much I can do a little bit of fasting until prayer comes back I can do that now God I'm asking that you open my eyes you're the only one that can do that can you say Amen you're the only one yeah bring these situations you're in your situation right now and maybe God has allowed it for you to be in that situation God allows that because God's got a supernatural for you amen God's not wanting to promote speakers and not he's not wanting to promote men he's wanting to promote his spirit in in our lives well can I hear a great big amen amen now so we find from 14 to 17 we just read it where the prophecy has been given and then from [Music] 18 unto um I I would say 18 on down to the 24th chap verse now now we're finding worship now we we see this worship and I would say it's it's from 18 well let's just read it Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the coites of the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high now I want you to I want once again when you know that it's accurate brother brandham brother brandham had even said this and this is this is something that I and and and I I I want that Supernatural presence of God and I and I want I I I I I want us to to to have where God is genuinely speaking because then we can have a a confidence but brother brandom uh before I go any further brother brandom you remember the girl that had the dream and and she would come back to brother brandom and ask I I I'm waiting for my interpretation you remember that and and she would come and and and brother brandom says come here honey he says says you don't want brother brandom just giving you an in an interpretation he said I think I might know what that means but you don't want me because when it comes down to when you need to hear from the Lord you're going to want to know that what I say is coming from the Lord he said so if I told you something and and it's not from the Lord It's Me guessing but if the Lord tells me I promise you I'll give you the interpretation of that dream Now isn't that just wonderful you see because he says you're going to need to have confidence in me now as we read this here and again I just love this chapter as as it's all marked up amen Jehoshaphat 18th verse bows his head all of the Juda and they're worshiping the Lord the Levites 19th verse stood up to praise the Lord and Israel with a loud voice 20th verse they rose up early in the morning they went into the wilder wilderness of tocoa as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God and so shall you be established believed in his Prophet so shall you prosper when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they begin to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount seir and they come against which were come against Judah and they were smitten the children of Ammon and Moab stood up stood against the inhabitants of Mount seir and utterly D slay and Destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir everyone helped to destroy another and when Judah come toward to watch to to the Watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and beheld they were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none escaped and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which were stripped off of them for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much can I hear a great big amen amen do you love him amen can we expect it yes I think we can expect it if you go on down there to the 27th verse and they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem the musicians can come Jehoshaphat in the Forefront of them to go again to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them to Rejoice over their enemies and they came to Jerusalem with suies and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Lord and the fear of the Lord fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel well I am expecting anticipating I'll let you sing that I'm expect anticipating the of God oh

did but I don't I don't want us laboring late at night all throughout the week and then so if we think that we can sort of help out and where we're not going to where we can rest up a little bit more towards Wednesday night that would probably be a blessing if if we could do that so um I I don't know how uh um uh that you know Caleb takes care of the Cs and and the numbering on the chairs and all of that kind of thing and so but if you're going to do that tomorrow night what time were you wanting to start that 5 okay so if we done something like it 6 if I I would say now I yeah I I I would say
