Worship You amen you got to worship on your lips this morning a praise this evening amen that's what we were created to do is to worship him in our actions the angels can only worship Him by songs but we can worship Him by Our Lives you know the Angels didn't know what it was like to be bound didn't know what it was like to be sick but you do so you've got a true heartfelt worship cuz you know what it's like to be heading to hell but God set you free you thankful for that this evening you thankful for the blood amen if you have your Bibles tonight I've got two portions of scripture Luke 1 and 1 and John 14 and2 amen you love the Lord this evening amen that's got a simple subject tonight and I won't hold you long and I went a little long this morning so I won't hold you long tonight U but Luke 1 and 1 and before we read can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're we're thankful for your grace Lord and and the blood that's that you shed for us Lord you gave us Lord such a remedy father to bring us separation father and that we can live a life above reproach Lord God as we come into this service Lord a new opportunity father father God I ask that you would speak to the hearts tonight Lord speak through these lips of clay father Lord I ask that your spirit would come and confirm your word to the hearts father may it edify father Lord may it be not just be another sermon that we hear tonight or another service that we come to Lord but God may we leave this place renewed Lord and energized by your spirit we ask these things in your name amen amen Luke 1 and one the Bible would say for as much as many have taken in hand a set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most likely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having a perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou Hast been instructed and John 14 14 and 12 I like how he's putting that that a perfect understanding is bringing a certainty John 14 and2 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do he shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever things ye shall whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son amen you may maybe sea tonight and if I just had a simple thought tonight it would be a reflection of the word and one definition of certainty as I I pointed out a perfect understanding uh brings a certainty one definition of that word certainty is firmness and you know so it took a perfect understanding to bring to us the firmness of the word that we might not that we may know the direction we're going and brother Brandon would say the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on and I believe that before anybody can ever move or have real confidential Faith it's first have to know where they stand how to stand and after they make their stand I believe that's essential for you cannot just headlong plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you are plunging and you've got to know and if our faith is set in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction and you know and I like how brother br is putting that the church can never progress until it knows the grounds it's uh progressing upon and so it would take a perfect understanding to give uh positively in a day that there's there that there's negative all around us and I I Clos this morning talking about how we're living in a negative world but there's a positive world that is the word that has been giv to us and we can see that we're living in a day where there's depression anxiety you know no one has a good day anymore you can ask somebody going down the road you know you're having a good day well this happened to me that happened you know this went wrong you know nobody has a good day anymore we're living in a day where it's negative our our our speech is negative you know we're tearing this down or or this ain't right it's a negative world where you can't even believe anybody's word anymore you know but in the midst of that all God has given us a perfect understanding to give us a firmness to know that this one's word may fail this here might not happen the way we want it to happen but there's one thing that is firm that is the word of God and I believe that we have a we have a positive word in this generation that has dissolved all of the doubt and has put us upon a solid rock and brother Brandon would tell us in Redemption has two parts are coming out and entering into two first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you've got to come out of the world to enter into Christ and you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith there cannot be one thing in your way you really to really have genuine Faith you must leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind to enter into Faith so before you can move into Faith you got to come out of doubt and that's why we needed a positive word to dissolve the doubts to let us know we can move into the firmness of the word and I believe we're living in a day where the bride is no longer an infant bride but she has grown into maturity and that's why the the uh uh the devil fights so hard against this message because I believe this message is our adoption it's the placing of sons we're not just an infant bride wandering around wondering where we're going wondering what to say but we've come to a place of maturity where we know the grounds we are progressing we know that we're we're being placed into our inheritance being placed into our adoption where the word all of Heaven is backing you up and so we see that the and since this is the casee the devil is coming so hard against this message and brother Brandon would say they want to say the days of Miracles has passed and so forth let him go ahead and say it but let us do the service for the Lord they hated him because they were jealous of him that's the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people and the same as they're doing now if they can destroy the influence of the message before the people they've got the thing whipped and so we see what the Devil comes and read what he's after when he comes with doubt when he comes with Skeptics when he comes with criticism he's trying to destroy the influence of the message in our lives you know he's trying to destroy the positivity and that's why there's all these other websites believe the sign you've got this one that's left the message but if you go and look up these these these these guys as life that has left the message there's no reflection there's no reflection of the word you know there there their children are lesbians and there are there was a pastor that had a big old church that has left the message now was daughters are lesbians he's he's drinking beer now his wife was cut cut her hair living in shorts now you know you see they're trying to destroy the influence while they're being on to by they're being uh where they're being influenced by another life but you see we can see the direction that they are going that should put a determination in our life that this message is the truth what they God has no ly but what we have is the life and we see that if the influence of the message is ever destroyed then we're willing to be influenced by something else we're willing to be influenced by what this one says about us or what that one says about us you know but if our influence is on the right thing then it don't matter what anybody says it's what the word says like I was saying this morning and the blood speaks positive things so it don't matter the negativity around us if our influence is on the right thing then we don't matter what they say about us and brother Brandon would say it's a chain you're hanging over hell with it and that's the only thing that'll carry you through when the believer becomes a make believer and lives on one word that's contrary to this word he cuts his fellowship with God and one leag broke and remember your faith in this word is like a chain a chain is its strongest out its weakest length that's right it's the strongest cuz that's all it'll hold and if there's if there's something in the word that's puzzling to you something that you have heard different but they say but they say thee or or that was for the apostles and things that was for a day gone by when the scripture says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't let that be a weakness fortify it hold it up and wrap your life into it because that's the only thing that's going to take you to take you over the Flames of hell that is right and I like how brother Brandon puts it if there's something puzzling to you in the word don't let that be a weakness and I think that that that is some good advice if you run into something and you don't understand don't dwell on it in a way where the devil's going to come and say yep the message is wrong you know oh see here because brother Brandon would tell us we have the devil's we have the answer to the devil's question so I believe this message has every solution to every problem but if it's something puzzling to us and if we're influenced by the wrong thing that question is going to turn to doubt you know cuz one question leads to another question but it's okay to have questions it's natural to have questions but don't let that question turn into doubt because once it turns into doubt then your chain is going to be weaken you know cuz brother Brandon would say this word is what is going to carry you over the Flames of hell and so if your change starts to get weak then you're going to fall right into right into despair right into doubt right into discouragement but if you can remain in the influence with no doubts with no negativity you've got a road that you're walking you've got like I said this morning it's the King's Highway that we are walking upon but you see the Bible would tell us that the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe but in order to remain safe you got to dwell in it you know and so faith in the positive word is is carrying us over the flame of hell but we got to make sure our our our chain is strong and you know brother Brandon would say and and and I said it again that the scripture says that the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him so in another world where these five senses do not declare five senses only contact this world if you had no feeling you couldn't feel nothing feeling wouldn't be nothing to you that would be in another world if you had no sight then then then what you look at would be another world you know nothing about it so these five senses is the only thing that God L us that let us use and he says now there was another one called Faith but by faith you walk up a ladder and finally you can get so high until you break into another world which is a vision there you can see and that's so incredible cuz he's saying if you can't see the things that are in front of you are in a another world because you can't tap into that Dimension but if you can see the things that are in another world become clear to you and he says that's the way it is with faith faith you climb up a ladder and you get so high that by a vision you can see what is in another world that's why we have to hang on to our faith because it's faith that Taps into the Unseen World and we and this is simple brother Brandon would tell us that there's pictures going through here there's radio wav right that's going through this building right now but it's in another dimension and you need an instrument to tap into that Dimension and bring it into reality and he says that's what a radio is that's what a television is it Taps into those dimensions and brings those pictures into reality and he would say the promises of God are going through the building right your healing your deliverance the Holy Ghost but it's in another dimension so we needed an instrument which is Faith to tap into that Dimension and bring it into reality and brother brandom says faith climbs up the ladder and looks into another world and by Vision you can see what is there oh my that's why you cannot be dissolved in doubt because it's your faith you know like I was saying this morning brother brandom says hisp would apply the blood and he says it's your faith that applies the token you know so it's your faith that connects you with the supernatural so if you lose your faith you lose the connection that brings you up a ladder where you can see the Supernatural cuz you know you can't see your rapture right now but it's faith that says it's there you can't see the body change right now but it's faith that says it's mine so we cannot allow the influences of Doubt allow the influences of negativity tear down the faith that God has given us in this generation you know brother Brandon would talk about the carnival and would say if you're at the carnival and we didn't have money to get into y'all remember the story says if we didn't have the money to get into it he says what we would do is we'd go to the fence and we would look for a little knole you know and he says I would jump up and grab the top of the fence and would pull myself up and look through the hole but you wasn't able to see it but I was and so you would ask me what do you see and I would tell you that he would tell us that I see a giraffe or or I see this and he would come back down he says then you would ask again well what else is there and so he would jump back up grab a hold of the fence pull himself and look again and would say well there's an elephant there's this there's that and you see brother Brandon was able to see those things in this type we wasn't able to but our faith in his report would put us there oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would go so high brother brother Brandon would type prophets as Eagles right he says those Eagles would go so high and he says John the Revelator and all of them would see all the way into the millenni him and would report it back they were Eagles that would go up so high and would report what they saw but it's our faith that lifts us up that ladder where we can see the same things that they saw oh if he seen Victory I see Victory if you seen the holy ghost in the age I see the Holy Ghost if you seen a Rapture I see the Rapture I'm not allowing my faith to be dissolved in the doubt but I'm allowing my faith to dissolve the doubt oh Hallelujah but we see what the Brandon would tell us if we lose Faith all of our hopes is gone and if we lose Faith all of our spiritual reality is gone oh my so if you lose your faith our spiritual reality is gone and and and and you notice that it was Jesus that would pray for Peter and would say the the devil desires to have you that he can sift you like wheat but I have prayed for you that you lose not your faith how come he didn't say that you lose not your mind or lose not your courage or or lose not your health or lose this or lose that he knew if he would keep the faith his health would be okay if he keeps the faith his mind might be battered his body might be torn but if he keeps the faith there's nothing the devil can do to destroy him but I believe that he didn't just pray for Peter but he prayed for you he interceded and he's interceding now on your behalf that you lose not your faith oh he didn't say it wouldn't be easy that the cross wouldn't be heavy that the struggles wouldn't be hard but he prayed that you will lose that he will lose not your spiritual reality which is your faith oh Hallelujah that he may sift you like wheat he desired to have you and I'm so glad he's just Desiring the the devil desired to have your mind Desir to have your children desired to have your marriage but if the the faith is there there's nothing he can do but desire and you notice brother Brandon would say to to you my brethren that is standing here tonight you did the only thing you can do when you're convinced that you're wrong then you're convicted of sin something You' done wrong there was only one pardon there was only one way of Pardon and that's through the cross and you've walked up here tonight before the all this people and accepted him as your savior he says and then that was you being convinced that you're wrong convicted that convicted and convinced that he is right convicted that you are wrong and and you know that really struck me that this can happen in the positive as well when you're convinced then you're convicted you see a god a conviction me message convictions don't come by accident it's by you being convinced and you don't become convinced by accident it's you getting all the doubt I hope this okay this evening I know it's slower but you see it's you getting all the doubt out that you can be convinced so it can produce convictions you see you you can look at our elders here brother Merl or or these Elders that are among us you know they didn't get here by accident it was by some convictions you know it was convictions that would stand against the tide convictions that was stand against the pressure and that and we can take a take example as young people that how did they do this it wasn't easy the pressures were hard but they were convinced of it and I say if there's ever a time to be convinced of the message H is today if there's ever a time to get into the tapes for ourself H is today and not just listen to a tape but hear it you know cuz you can listen the the definition of uh of hearing is to do it unconsciously you know you can holler somebody and they hear you but to listen to it you got to make a choice you know so let's not just hear the words of a prophet but let's listen to it let's apply it let's take it more than just an idea or an opinion and put it as an absolute I believe this message is the absolute to the bride it's not an opinion it's not an idea but it's our ticket out of here it's the way that is going to get us Rapture Ready you believe that this this evening but you notice Nicodemus would tell Jesus no man can do these things andless God be with him and you can almost have pity upon Nicodemus because he would realize something different about Jesus but this is more than a man this is more than more than just a a a human human ability but but God has got to be with him but you notice that there was another influence that had convinced him otherwise because the Bible tell us that he would come to Jesus in the middle of the night he was ashamed to be identified with him because he was still tied by another influence and it was because of these influences that Jesus would be upon the Earth God made flesh and they would not recognizing and you see if we're influenced by other things the realities of the world will be right among us but we will not recognize it you know like I was saying this morning that the blood of bulls and goats were types and shadows of the Redeemer to come they could not they would cover sin but they could not divorce sin but whenever Jesus would come he wasn't a type he was the reality he wasn't a form he was the person he wasn't pointing to something but all that they were pointing to was met up in Jesus you know brother Brandon would preach the Masterpiece and would say after after Adam had felled in the in the garden God went back to work to create another Masterpiece you know and brother Brandon would say he would start up the foundation which was the Patriarchs Joseph Jacob Isaac and uh and and Abraham he would move up to the body you know which was the prophets and all of these were pointing to one to come and whenever Jesus come upon the Earth the portion that Abraham had was now in him with fullness what Isaac had was in him what Jacob had what all of these other ones had was in the fullness but because of another influence Nicodemus was in the presence of the fullness and could not recognize it oh my we can be in a message Church hear a message preached but if our influence is from another world or from another another Direction the fullness of the word can be in our midst with the resurrected power with the power to shave and to and to deliver but we will not recognize it if our influence is from somewhere else but you see here stood a perfect reflection of God himself when you seen Jesus you seen the father if you wanted to see the father you looked at Jesus and brother Brandon would say remember he was betrayed all times back through the Old Testament we find him being The Rock in the wilderness that was smitten Rock in the wilderness I am the rock that was in the wilderness but that was the stone that had not come to his Perfection yet but in type form it followed the church to draw from it that he could draw and to give life to those he could give life to but he was The Rock in the wilderness he had not been made man yet he was only a type and so the types they would have in the wilderness Was Made Up in Jesus the Mana that fell in the wilderness was in Jesus Jesus would tell them your fathers ate of the man in the wilderness and are every one of them dead in other words the type that did not have a sustaining power it could quench the hunger but they got hungry again but he would say I am the bread of life that has come out of Heaven if you weat of me you look at the rock that was smitten in the wilderness was a type here was Jesus saying I am the Fountain of Life in other words all of the types through the Old Testament was met in the fullness oh what the Rock had was in the fness what the Mana had was in the fness The Brass serpent was in the fullness the the the Aaron or Moses's Rod was in the fullness and I say little church we're not following a type in this generation we've got the fullness oh what justification had was made up in sanctification what sanctification had was met in 1906 the restoration of the gifts but we're not stuck there we've had to move on to the fullness of the word oh my we're not just Justified we're not just Sanctified we're not just restored to the gift but the life of the word the literal life of the word has come to a body and is reflecting itself oh Hallelujah that's why you got to move on we're thankful for justification but you got to be Sanctified you can't just stay as Sanctified you got to move on to the Holy Ghost but you can't just stay there there's a fullness there's a word that has been given in this generation oh Hallelujah but but the Brandon would say they did it because they didn't know who he was they they didn't know the Vindication of God's word wasn't standing up there on that day now it was that one day excuse me that was right it was that one day just keep them lws and things but the same laws they was keeping was pointing them to a time that he would come to be this man that he was supposed to be they had this part but they didn't take the other part but the Brandon is saying the portion of truth that they had was pointing them to to the fullness and brother Brandon would tell us that all of the denominations denominated around a portion of truth but left the rest of the truth you know if they would just realize what they're hanging on to was pointing to something greater to come you know if the pente costs could never realize that the fullness of the word has come you know brother Brandon would tell us that it's like a man who can write a check but has no money in the bank or the man can write a has the money in the bank but don't don't don't know how to write the check you know here they are they've got portions of truth but they're not willing to move on to the fullness that God has brought in this generation and you know brother Brandon would tell us that here God would enveil himself but then they would Avil him again not by by not by a natural Veil but by a spiritual veil of Creeds and of traditions and brother Brandon would say just like God went to work to make make another Masterpiece in Jesus he would go back to work to make another masterpiece upon the Earth and he would say the church had started there at Pentecost that's where the church had began and he says then it went to the Dark Ages whenever had not see a Rome the church would denominate right and he says he go through the Dark Ages he would have to go into the ground because the corn of wheat if it don't die it abides alone right where the brandom says the life would go into the seed or go into the ground but the life was still there and I think it's so incredible they were persecuted the first church was persecuted they were burnt to the Stak they were crucified the devil was trying to do everything that he could do but the life was still there and brother Brandon would say that it was like the wheat plant youall remember the wheat plant and brother Brandon would says God will bring this life through the reformers and he would say this here a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself it's through a certain process during a certain period of time that a Single Seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come into a plant which will in turn be a barrier or carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in multiplied form oh like the seed that would go into the ground would come through a process back to the originality but it multiplied for oh that's the day we are living in and brother Brandon would say he would go through a process say he would say here whenever the seed would go into the ground then that life would move into the stock and he says which was Luther the First Reformation and then he says that life would move from the stalk to the tsel which was Wesley and he says then that life would keep on moving it would move into the shook which was 1906 the restoration of the gifts but then he says that life would move on again to its originality to back back to what it was when it went into the ground and brother Brandon would say this like in Israel perfect type if we had time I just got a few minutes left but in a perfect type in the beginning everywhere the pillar of fire went was life and God was that light and I don't care if it was midnight whether it was a good selected place when that Pillar of Fire moved the trumpet sounded and Israel moved with it he says hallelujah when the trumpet sounded Martin Luther moved on with it he organized not himself but the man after him God took the life out of that brought it laid it in the grave then out come wesling he saw that great big organization so he sounded a trumpet of sanctification see more of the word when he did out they moved out right out of Luther right into Methodist and when the Pinnacle saw it they sounded a trumpet it's time the return of the gifts see what they did they sounded a trumpet how they come and then they organized but remember after the husk that's three stages that we know of there was nothing left but the grain oh so after the third stage it's back to its originality again so justification made way for sanctification sanctification made room for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made room for the Holy Ghost himself the person to return back to the word oh Hallelujah that's the day we're living in church we're not living in the first we're living at the end time where the word has come back in its maturity and it's getting a bride ready for Rapture oh hallelujah it's getting a pride to produce the promises of an invincible Army of a spotless Pride it's not your works it's the word back in its originality inside of a body oh hallelujah we're reflection of what this word is not of what you can do not of your ideas we're reflecting the power of the word oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say uh how would the bride be brought back to the side of the word because he said it was smitten off of the word he says how would it get back to him he said but Malachi 4 he was to restore back to the original I will restore saith the Lord so the way we're getting back to the originality was by or the original word and brother Brandon would say the stalk and the TOs and the Shu was never the seed but it looked more like the seed as they progressed but he would say that the Shu will look so much like the seed but it would start to pull back and whenever you would pull back there stood The Original Seed oh my but the brandom would say now what did it say what did he say in Revelations 10 that would take place why was the trip the Tucson to open to the to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel message the whole word of God would be made manifest the seal that what that uh that what all the stock has left off and why and all about it would be manifest in this time is that what the word said then we see it then here we are where are we at the only thing that the there was only one thing that is the Harvest is here she is dead ripe she is ready now for the coming oh brother br going say the alpha has been become the Omega the seed that went into the ground has come through the process and is now back in its originality oh Hallelujah brother brandom you know he would have the vision he would have the vision of the preview of the Bride y'all remember that and it was it was sort of neat because we was in Jeffersonville uh a few months back or or whenever it was and we was able to go to the shopping center to where this was at it was sort of neat you know hearing brother brandom tell this and reading it and here we are at the location of it you know brother Brandon would have a vision and he would say there was a man there was a voice with him that would tell him I'm going to give you a preview of The Bride you remember that he says here would come the bride and he would say it was they were long dresses no makeup lone care he says there were just beautiful and he says they were marching on they were looking up and marching and then the voice would say I'm giving you a preview of the church and he says here would come the church we all we all know the vision here would come the church you know they were ugly they they were dressed red and he says then the American church will come and here would come the American church he would say they were naked dancing the worldly music and his heart would begin to break you know is this all that we could produce you know and then he heard the voice saying the the the bride will come and previe youw again oh my and here would come the bride and he says they were dressed the same and he says they were all in different different garments but they were all modest and he says you notice that the Bride come twice but the church came once he says how come because the same bride the same seed that went into the ground in the beginning is the same seed that has come back in its originality in the end time oh my the devil has tried to destroy this life but he has not got enough power to keep you down he may throw complexes he may throw insecurities but there's a life on the inside of this bride that is reflecting the word and you know he would say that the Bride come twice the church came once and he says you notice how come they were all dressed differently cuz he says that represents the bride around the world of many different many different nations he says this one may have been German you know I'm so thankful that it ain't just Americans that it's going to make a Rapture that it's making up the bride but it's there maybe in Russia or in Germany or in Australia wherever it is it is all making up the same word making up the same bride oh Hallelujah but you will see that whenever Jesus was upon the Earth what would he would say he would say go to the upper room and tell you're end doed with power upon High then the life would go from one person to multiple people and brother Brandon would say here he Has Come Today he says not in a man but now in Men In other words not just one person but it's in a multiplied form and I believe we're more than just the church but we are the literal spoken word of Jesus Christ and you know the Bible would say that they looked at Peter and John and perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men but they took notice they had been with Jesus and I said let me be that let that be my testimony I might not have much I might not look like much I might be look like ignorant and unlearned but let them take notice that I have been with Jesus and what what would give this what would give this reflection I think it was Peter and John that would walk by the gate beautiful and would say silver and Gold Have I None but what I do have I give unto thee they was just a reflection of what Jesus was they didn't have anything to offer but the supernatural oh man I see that's what the bride has might not have much to offer but we've got the supernatural we've got the supernatural in our homes we've got the supernatural in our marriages we've got the supernatural when we go to work the supernatural goes with us you know brother Brandon would say the angel of the Lord accompanies the message over and you know I always listen to messages at chur or when I'm working and that's comforting that whenever I'm at work the angel of the Lord's with me when I go through a trial the angel of the Lord is with me that's why we play those tapes because that is the Angel of the Lord that is accompanying it if it's young boys play those tapes young girls play those tapes it ain't you're not too young to get into the into this word and get a revelation you know I remember I think I was probably 15 or 16 and you know here would come the the Je 's Witnesses you know would come up and and would try to debate you know and I remember this finally okay I'll talk with you and he he had a pamphlet you know and he would say okay you know what do you want to talk about out of these out of these these subjects and I said let's talk about the godhead you know and here we go I was a teenage boy running around in circles around this guy and he would say you know what let's have another meeting I got to go I don't have enough time today he would go back and he would come back again the next week with some more material we would go round and round he will leave again come back the next week you know and here we was mowing I think it was a few weeks later I was out Mowing and here comes some more Jehovah's Witnesses you know and they would come up and would say hey we're talking and he they would say what do you want to talk about I said well I think I got water baptism that time I said well let's talk about this one and we started to talk and she stopped and she says wait what's your name and I said I'm Josh Martin she goes oh I've heard if you have a good day it was a teenage boy that had got into the word for himself not an adult I was I wasn't even preaching much at that time but it was somebody that was under the influence that was able to handle a sword and that's what we need today is somebody Under the Influence that is able to handle a sword if the spirits come against you you're able to handle it if lust comes against you you're able to handle it it ain't how much you can know it's how much Revelation you can get come on now you can know all of it but if you don't got a revelation of it if you're not influenced by it it's not going to do much for you oh Hallelujah but we would see that God changes his mask but never his nature and brother Brandon would say whenever whenever Moses or whenever God was veiled in Moses he was the Living Word to the people and you know whenever Moses was veiled when God was veiled behind Moses the supernatural accompany right here with the the the frogs were brought into existence the lice the water was turned into blood the supernatural fire followed where he was veiled whenever he was veiled in the prophets It Was Elijah I think that would say no there's not going to be no rain nor due till I call for it the supernatural will accompany him because God was veiled in him and oh my and the same thing today brother the brandom says God changes his mask but never his nature and so if God is veiled inside of a body today that means the superatural accompanies it oh hallelujah or our skins have been changed and and I know I went over some of these things I think a few Services ago and by the brand I would say that whenever the the the Shak Glory was Behind the B your skins he says it was once animals behind those skins but now with those Skins are a housing place for the glory of God and then he says so can your skins be changed into the housing place for the glory of God oh hallelujah what would happen behind those Badger skins it was dead Aaron's dead Rod right that was dead and old and all dried up but in the Shina Glory it would Blossom like it did at the originality oh the church we might have been dead we might have been in Creeds but in the shakina of Glory it brought back the same life that went into the ground at the beginning oh the works that I do you shall do I will restore sayith the Lord and brother Brandon he would preach the restoration of the brid tree it would say it was four death Messengers that brought life brought de death to the tree and he says now it's for Life Messengers that has brought the life back to the tree and it's give me a few more minutes and and I'll bring us to a close and but the Brandon will tell us that these four death Messengers one took the fruit one took the leaves one took the bark one took the life but he says the roots was still there and he says God promised to restore and I think it's so incredible that he would say and four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree to you get it he says amen for God said I will restore he's going to restore it how but death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley sanctification what was the third Pentecost by the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word what the word and then brother Brandon would would go on in the message and would call up the fourth light he says there was three lights justification sanctification the Holy Ghost but he says now we're in the fourth light and then he ask what is the fourth light and he would say the word made manifest oh and I thought that was so incredible and he says what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh the fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification being planted sorry sanctification being planted the baptism of the Holy Ghost organization ations died out and Christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap so what is the fourth it is the word made flesh the proof of the Resurrection sign what was the resurrection sign y'all remember whenever they come to Jesus and would say give us a sign and he would say as Jonah was in the belly of the well for three days and nights so will the son of man be in the belly of the Earth for for three days and nights and so in order for there to be a proof of the Resurrection sign the body had to come to life right cuz we know that the spirit was alive the body was in the grave but Jesus he would go brother Brandon would tell us he would go to he would go to hell right and preach to the to the souls that was in prison he would go up to Paradise right so God didn't die the body died so in order for the resurrection sign to have proof the body had to come out of the Tomb oh Hallelujah and what would happen the body come out of the Tomb and would meet the Tom that was walking on the road to EMAs right what would happen as he broke the bread they realize he's doing the same signs that he did before he died before he went into the ground he's doing now after he resurrected again oh and brother brandom says the fourth light is the word made flesh the proof of the Resurrection sign what's that mean brother Josh the life of God has come back to the body the bride of Christ has resurrected out of the tombs of organizations out of dogmas out of traditions and has the same life oh just like Jesus broke the bread before he went into the ground after he came out of the ground he broke the bread the same way he had the same signs oh when the first church that went into the ground the second this last church that is risen up again as the same life oh brother Brandon would say it be a continuation of the book of Acts were a reflection of what this word is oh Hallelujah his body there had to be a body proof that he's alive you're his body this evening you're his mouth you're his hands you're is feet your is life upon the earth oh Hallelujah your is life upon the earth oh but the Brad of Messiah as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although tied in many places he was the first fruits of those who slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there have to be a sheath wave again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one to come to maturity the that the first one that proved it was the wheat and it proved that it was the Sheep Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time the first time there would come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of a dark denominationalism will be a message but the further that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and is being waved over the People by the same signs Wonders that he did back there oh I just love the full maturity of the word back to its full power the full maturity but like like a pastor had said Wednesday it's the Living Word the Locos it's the Dynamics coming to the mechanics you know brother Brandon would stress that so much you know and he would say I think it what what what what the rising of the sun he would say we've got the mechanics down we've got the word down but where's the Dynamics and here brother Brandon was saying the full the word is coming as maturity with its full power oh my that's what I want this evening is power not just word I want the supernatural I trust that's your desire this evening as well let our musicians come this evening I want the Supernatural that's what the bride age is it's the it's an anointing calling you out and placing you oh not placing you in ideas but placing you in your adoption placing you where you're manifesting the the sunship of who you're meant to be manifesting oh brother Brandon would say this though many how many false impersonators rise from Janus and jambers with all their gimmicks to do everything that Moses did never shook him or Aaron at all they know like job they knew knew who their inspiration come from they knew it was thus saith the Lord you know when I heard that that really that spoke to my heart they knew where their inspiration came from they knew it was thus sayeth the Lord we know where our inspiration has come from it hasn't come from Jeffersonville it hasn't come from Jerusalem it has come from th thus saith the Lord you know brother Brandon would say that Moses would write he would meet the pillar of fire and by Revelation he would write the four books of the of the Old Testament you know the four the the first books he would write up by Revelation and then he would say that the Apostle Paul would meet the same Pillar of Fire in by Revelation would say that je Jesus of the new or Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new he would say Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote what they saw but the Apostle Paul would write by Revelation because he metant the pillar of fire and then he would say the same Pillar of Fire that wrote the old and the New Testament is here today interpreting what the word says oh Hallelujah the same Pillar of Fire that gave Revelation to the Apostle Paul to say Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new is the same Pillar of Fire that says this message is Christ this message is your adoption this message is your inheritance it's the manifestation of sons coming to their their position and saying hey satan get off my land get out of my house get out of my marriage I've come to who I am I've come to Mater he to maturity I know who
