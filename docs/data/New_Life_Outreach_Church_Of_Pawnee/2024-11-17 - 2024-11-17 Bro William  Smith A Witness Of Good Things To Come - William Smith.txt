[Music] [Applause] bloodline [Music] Hallelujah you believe that this morning this evening praise the Lord if we can all [Music] stand to me I believe that has to be a revelation in every Christian amen every believer cuz when you know that there's not a devil out there that's going to hurt you you might go through your trials and you might go through your tribulations but when oh Jesus gives you that Revelation nothing can take it from you praise be to God if we can open our Bibles to acts one and then we're going to go to Proverbs 14 I sent my scriptures to our sister but I don't know if she got them I did it too late probably but hopefully she can catch on quick here but here acts 1 and8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samar and into U and unto the uttermost parts of the earth let's go to Proverbs 14 we like to start about the 25th verse here in Proverbs 14- 25 it says a true witness deliver Souls but a deceitful witness speaketh lies in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of Refuge the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just love you Lord there's a lot of emotions knowing that this is our last service here as a member of this great church the Lord I'm a witness and Lord I just pray that you bless each and every heart I've had many here lately Lord send me texts tell telling me how they appreciate me and sharing what we've done in their lives and Lord I pray you bless them because it wasn't me it wasn't Sharon it had to been your holy goodness in our lives for us to to be able to do that Lord and Lord I ask you Lord to take this little thought and Lord I pray you bless each and every heart that's in this place and Lord let us be great Witnesses Lord of your Holy Ghost Lord we just ask these things in your wonderful name amen I would like to minister tonight if we could for a little while a witness of good things to come brother brandham preached a message called Witnesses and he said here he says Jesus here was appointing his apostles for the qualification of the holy spirit before they were were to be go excuse me let me restart that over the qualifications of the Holy Ghost before they were to go be Witnesses so there is a qualification for a a man or woman to be a witness of the good things to come amen I'm so thankful that I see a lot of witnesses here today I believe that God has touched each and every one of you even you young people but we have to make sure that we know what we're talking about it's not just reading your Bible and coming to church but it's a life it's something that's down deep in inside of your soul that's anchored between you and God that not a devil in hell can take it from you because there's things that God's going to have you do that other people are not going to understand because lots of people have to reason things out into their heads God doesn't want us to reason things out he wants us to have faith in the word and if we have faith in that word it it's going to make you do things that you would never do at all because God is doing it and brother random talked about this court of witnesses has to know something just anybody can't come in and be a witness it's got to be somebody who knows something yeah and that's the way it is when a when are witnessing of the Lord it takes somebody who knows something so Jesus thought said this that before they could become his Witnesses they had to wait in Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high then they would be the witnesses of all over the world in jerus Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and so even the disciples as they followed him three and a half years they saw a lot of things happen they were eyewitnesses they had the ears to hear they had the eyes to see exactly who Jesus Christ on Earth in that three and a half years what he was doing all right they were eyewitnesses of Jesus Christ in the fullness yes sir but they still denied him right before he got crucified so it takes more than just being an eyewitness you have to have an experience in what you see and so he goes on and he says here and he says he goes and he says in the court or let's go to Acts 2 acts 225 first it says for thou shall be his Witnesses unto all men of what thou Hast seen and heard and then brother Braham keeps going down and he says in the courts there is two kinds of WI witnesses that will stand that's ey or ear now if you're sitting in a room and looking through a glass and see an accident your witness your word is no good okay because you were looking through a glass I believe that's what's happening with the denominations today there they're witnessing something but they're not in actual involvement of the word of God because they're on a Creed they're taking a Creed instead of the word of God they're seeing the good things they're reading the good things but it's not coming to life into their life they're hoping that this is happening they're hoping that Trump is going to do something great they're hoping because he's saying Jesus this and Jesus is that but if we don't get watch out what we're saying and looking we're going to follow that same group thinking that he is something special he is just a man that has been voted in by a population of people right and we know through the word of God that this world is doomed right they're witnessing something but they never had the experience of the Holy Spirit coming down inside of their soul and showing them the true word right and we're so happy to see people saying Christian things but you can go on there and see there's people that are hating so much hate the devil is hating the people movie stars pops off and says oh he ain't going to get it no no no they have to watch what they say just like what you and and I have to say they're witnessing something but they don't have the real because they're looking through that glass our children has to have an experience just like you and you and Mama and daddies so you have to teach them how to get Jesus in them that Holy Spirit you've got to be an example you have to walk this walk and talk his walk with thus sayeth the Lord right amen amen and he says here and he goes and he says your word is no good because you were looking through a glass you have to be right there close to really know what you're talking about before you can be a witness you have to hear it or you have to see it before you can be a witness on the court or a case in the courts you can't say Miss so and so told me or Mr so and so told me Reverend so I like how he's put this Reverend so and so told me he's a witness but are you are you a witness all right you've got to hear what comes across this pulpit and take it home and dissect it and and and get into the word yourself and get the same Revelation from God We Trust in brother Wendell with all of our hearts but he can't get you there he can lead you there he can bring you to the word but now you have to eat the book and when you eat the book then you become an eyewitness of the good things to come and when that comes into your life and when you start seeing the manifestation of God living inside of your life through testimonies through things that God has done for you amen then you're not going up and going down and going up now you might go through a trial you might go through these things but you have thust sayith the Lord knowing that he's holding your hand and if you know that he's holding your hand you're not going to worry about cancer you're not going to worry about sickness you're not going to worry about your bill because you're going to trust in God if he wants you on the street then just trust him am for my God said he doesn't wants you on the streets yeah he wants you to be a witness he wants to show you that you are his children and he works through his children that great body Hallelujah so therefore no man can exactly Witness to the resurrection of Christ only by the Holy Ghost you have to be a personal witness yourself being there knowing something about it knowing what you're talking about and God help us to see that day what when men will be just what they are you know I say this now with all respect it isn't your City full of bootle joints yeah that's hurting us yeah here's what's hurting us more than ever is people who are professing to be Christians and not living it okay that's the thing see there's not a correct witness that's so true so if we're going to be a witness to God we've got to be living the word and to live the word is getting into the book getting into the message of the hour coming to church you might not like something that's going on in the church but you're not here because of that you're here to hear what comes across the pulpit what the word of God is helping you and I you could be at work and you can hear all them guys cussing and you can be listening to to the tape but you're not not going to go to work because that guy's cussing see we we we start picking and choosing what we want to do that's not a witness of God if you say that you're a man of God and a girl Christian girl or a mama that's a Christian you're going to come to church and show that person that's a hypocrite a real Christian by living a life in front of them all right then you'll have a witness behind you knowing oh that brother's got something and I've said some bad things about him but he's a real Christian you could be their savior with the Holy Ghost okay that's in you what we say out of our mouths hurts or blesses what we think doesn't hurt the other person it hurts you that's true because what we think we say if we're thinking on the good things of God we're thinking what God had done for us we won't be thinking and looking at other people and seeing bad things because now we're a real witness of the good things that come glory amen Proverbs 14:5 it says a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utterly lie we have a lot of them in the world today they call themselves Christians and they're cussing and they lie and they tell their bosses that this and that but a real Christian lives on the word of God and he's a he's an ambass he's a man or a woman that's standing in the place of God Walk in on the earth with the Holy Ghost living inside of him to show The Sinner that they need Grace what they've got in them that's a witness that's a true witness hallelujah hallelujah they can't witness until they have an experience and when they have an experience then they become a witness automatically because they are born again and all of the things of this world old things have passed away and all things have become new then you become a witness unto Jesus that's what that's what the three steps all about justification saves you sanctification cleans you up cleans you and then the third is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it gives you the power to be Witnesses of what you receive in your heart amen if you receive the Holy Ghost you're going to produce the word you're going to produce every sign that is in the promise in the book every promise in the book is mine and so I should be able to prophesy and witness of every bit of it all right because now I have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads and guides us to all truth we're not all going to understand the same thing but it's going to take brother Michael and me and brother wendle and brother Ken to talk things and talk about things and have an experience together as brothers cuz maybe brother Ken has something that I don't got maybe brother Michael has something that don't God maybe I'm looking at something wrong and I come to brother Wendell he says well this is what I see in the scripture what is he doing he's not kicking me he's Lifting me up to be a greater witness Hallelujah I want to be a greater witness I know that you want to be a greater witness and to be a greater witness you have to eat the book to become the book you got to eat it hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God Jesus knew before these Apostles could ever go out and be a correct witness that they had to have an experience what they were witnessing about okay wouldn't that be nice today if every Seminary did the same thing if every Christian did the same thing would just come to church and say now I accept Jesus as my personal savior I'm going to stay right here until I get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then I'm going out to be a witness see things would be different don't you think so he would not have that loose scattered testimonies if we're going to be witness and have testimonies we've got to be living oh church we make mistakes but that's what the Holy Ghost is there for to patch you on the back and say hey get right but right before you do it he grabs a hold of your heart and you go yeah Mama I didn't take the trash out cuz you would have said no I I took the trash out or I did this mama yeah but see when the Holy Ghost comes and starts messing with your spirit what is he doing he's protecting you and when he's protecting you from the sins of the world he's telling you don't lie don't do that don't smoke that cigarette don't do this it's because he's working on your conscience and when he's working on your conscious you should be able to say okay Lord hallelujah yes Lord do you know before you even come to God God was working on your conscience when those kids at school were trying to teach you to smoke and do things like that your conscience started going uh I know that's wrong I can't do that that's God tapping into there trying to protect that person yeah hello amen but what happens is we shun it we shun it because we let things that we're feeding off of make us grow into something that we shouldn't be we're feeding that black dog more than we're feeding the white dog the reason why we ain't Overcomers is because we're feeding the black dog more than we're feeding the white dog amen and so now he's saying scattered testimonies I don't want a scattered testimony I want to be on fire for God I want people to see that it ain't brother William doing nothing except believing and God God's doing the work through him I want people to see that brother William's real and those that have been texting me telling me how much I've done for you God bless you you don't know what that had done for me you should be telling other people in here that that's not leaving you should be doing this all the time to one another encouraging instead of put a knife in them all the time we need to encourage amen one of the greatest Witnesses in the Old Testament God encouraged him when Moses died he went to he went to Joshua and he put a jagger right into his heart no he encouraged him you're more than conqueror you go across here and I'll be with you just like I was with Moses he had an experience cuz God spoke to him and when he speaks to him now he can stand there and look at Israel and say we're going to go across and we're going to kill our enemies because now he's a witness of something that he seen or he heard wonderful praise be to God bless the Lord we can see here is here's the one of the greatest people God had Witnesses in the Old Testament and one witness was Noah Noah was a witness because that he had heard the voice of God in warning that telling him that there was coming a flood and that he must build an ark and prep preparation of the Ark was to get ready at once and he was to prepare a place for a safety for the people what did our Prophet do for us he broke the seals he opened up the church ages so that you can see the spirit behind all these churches he has come and given you a word that you and I can grab a hold of and you can be an overcomer of the things of the world because the Holy Spirit comes down inside of you and gives you the power to be great Witnesses of things to come your whole life is a journey from now until the day you die or you go in a Rapture you have to come to a place that he's everything to you everything Jes if your job is more important and you spend more time looking up businesses and all these kinds of things and you're trying to find more tools for your for for your businesses and you're trying to do this and do that you young people you're on there looking at a bunch of nonsense you're not going to be a good witness to God even if you say it out of your mouth you might as well be told now you're a liar because the Holy Ghost only brings us to the word it's not going to take us and do this over here and justify it he's going to condemn it because we're going to be Witnesses of something are you a hearer are you a seer or are you looking through a glass we need to fill that glass down and get out there among the word and get into the church and hear what God wants for you and for me Hallelujah these great Witnesses we got witnesses in the New Testament we got Peter you couldn't tell him how to fish cuz his daddy taught him when he was little he was one of the greatest fisherman out there he knew that this side of the boat you ain't going to catch nothing but when Jesus come and said Peter throw it on this side but Lord throw it on this side Peter he saw thus sayith the Lord speak well Glory all right and when he pulled up that net he was a witness he was a witness oh god of what God can do yes yes am Paul was a witness Paul was a studied man of the scripture yeah he was a man of cleanness he did exactly the law he lived by the law he did everything he could do but when he went to Damascus he was knocked off of his horse he was blind he couldn't see but he can hear yeah God blinded him so he can listen to the spirit of God saying Samuel why are you fighting against the Pricks who are you Lord I'm Jesus Oh what should I do Lord go to Damascus and you're going to meet this one and he's going to lay hands on you and I got a work for you to do Paul said he had to Die daily he said he had to die out to all those those things he had all of his teaching he had to throw in the trash can to become a witness to God yeah he had to clean his whole closets out he had to clean his bathroom out he had to clean his underneath his bed out he had to clean his kitchen out he had to throw all the beer out and all the wine out and everything else out and all of his stinting and all of his history he had to throw it out and say Here I Am Lord and God made him a witness of the good things to come bless church I don't know about you I haven't watched very much stuff until the last since uh the uh Trump wins and I've just been watching everything that people are saying like look God's back in the White House God's this and God's that God's this no God's in his people and they are the ones that are going to be Witnesses of the coming Rapture it's not here to make America great again because it's not going to even if that man can take2 billion dollar off it's still going to be in debt it's still going to be debt to the world but brothers and sisters there was one that paid the debt he paid it for all of us we just have to claim it and grab a hold of the world word of God and let God take you an ey on Words Christian soldiers yes yes we're fighting a fight good things are going to come those that believe and when you believe God's obligated to give you testimony he's obligated to show you that you're a witness [Music] Hallelujah and God has a witness Hallelujah so he was called and he went out and prepared an ark he prepared it 12 years of preaching get in the boat the boat wasn't even ready but he was preaching get in the boat be saved the rain's coming he's going to flood the Earth yeah they called him a crazy whack called him everything you could believe but he heard he was a witness of the word the voice of God speaking I'm warning you I'm warning you go pair a boat so you can have safety for my children prepare your boat they're going to make fun of you you sisters are going to make make fun of you CU you got long hair they're going to make fun of your children they're going to make fun of your boys because they're not maybe some of them are not athletic maybe they're just they're just good kids but people like to make fun of our children they're going to make fun of you at work brother Kobe Caleb don't use this here's what the brother said this morning let God fight our battles be a witness yes just like Jesus was when they were beating him and putting Stripes upon his back and putting nails in him and laid him on a cross your cross my cross he was a witness of scripture being fulfilled Hallelujah in God's eyes it was already done now the good things are coming now it's being manifested on Earth 1900 years ago oh Jesus now we have the same holy ghost that was in him the same spirit that fell on him when he was born The Same Spirit that fell on him when he was being baptized is in you today The Same Spirit God Almighty living inside of you let's get this personal God living in you the hope of glory the one that saved you that came to Earth in a body to give you eternal life forever more bless oh Hallelujah now he's here in the form of the Holy Spirit I can see him you can see him you can hear him when you look at a real man of God a real daughter of God that's living scripture you can say there's Jesus in leather yeah why cuz that person is dedicated to the Lord yes every day they're dedicating their lives before they go to work they're dedicating themselves at lunchtime they're dedicating themselves at night before they go to bed with their family they're getting ready for good things to come they want to be a part of that witness they want to be a part of that testimony that they were raptured off Hallelujah here they are the great Witnesses we see here in the Old Testament the three three Hebrew children they love God they loved it they dedicated themselves to the love of God without the Holy Ghost Church they dedicated themselves and when that King says you look at this image and worship it they didn't do it why because they were a witness of something they heard or something they saw Yes in the scripture yes yes and as they were standing there and they put judgment on them you're going to the fiery furnace they said well praise the Lord we're going to go in there we're going to burn up and go and be in the presence of God because I'm not going to bow down to your image or he's going to save us and that King looked in there and he saw four not three a witness of good things to come because they had faith in God they had something that was more real to them they didn't care if they're going to die they believe the word they believe that God was going to take them and give them a testimony and not only a witness and a testimony when they came out they were put it up up here instead of down here why because those that believe in God those that live God God will manifest his holy spirit in their lives and signs and wonders will follow them that belief bless the Lord praise to God oh glory to God that's the reason tonight that many of the Christians hasn't got the victory is because their sins has separated him from the blessings cut them off out in all directions places along and our hearts are hanging on the webbing waggling trees oh church we need to quit looking at everything else except the word the word will set you free the word will get you on track but man I messed up brother William God can fix that mess up that quick that bloodline that our precious brother sung this evening that blood when you come underneath the blood Satan can't go in there no more he can't touch you because you're washed every sin is washed oh he's got it in his brain but it's not in God's brain it's not even in heaven it's all in Hil Satan's going to be tormented of what you could f yes every bad thought every bad stuff is because of him not you okay when you get under that blood every judgment is going to be on his shoulders not yours cuz your witness is the good things to come because why you came exactly what your pastor has said justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we should be seeking a refilling of the Holy Ghost every time we come to church that's true very true so it takes the six days a week prepare your yourself for this we've got to come to a place that we're going to be Witnesses or liar Witnesses okay I want to change a little here I want to give you my testimony at the end of the service here and I pray that blesses you all now you get re you get the Holy Ghost now you're a witness now you're serving God you're reading your Bible you're listening to tapes you're coming to church and more you come to church the more you're getting hungry God bless you young men that are just going to brother Wendell's study and not talking about trash but saying hey what about the Holy Ghost what about the baptism of the hly that's hunger that's something in these young people that some of us old folks forgot we should be hungry for this word we should be so hungry for the word of Fellowship around the people but what happens we get we get caught up in things and we go find a corner somewhere and we hide ourselves we don't want to be around anybody because I'm going to fix it myself brother William every time he did that I fail on my face but I want to be a witness and to be a witness I got to get out of my closet and get out there and be a witness of the things that I've heard the things that I've seen amen and so if God's living inside of me I'm going to tell somebody how my fire got lit it doesn't take a whole bunch you see somebody at the at the job you see somebody at the store and you know they're having a bad day walk up to them say hey I know you're having a bad day I'm praying for you I don't know who you are but I'll be praying for you you can spark something in that person's soul that he'll say wait a minute I need to talk to you you you can lead somebody to God in the grocery store you can lead somebody to on the street corner you can lead somebody at work but we get so caught up in our own self we're not being Witnesses those disciples you want to go find out with the disciples they lived when they got the Holy Ghost when they were up in that upper room they were waiting and they waited and they waited and they waited and they waited but when that Holy Ghost come it changed every one of their lives they had to go tell somebody about Jesus they had to tell somebody what the Holy Ghost was here for and what they do they went back to the Old Testament and showed them the things that why they were drunk because it was already prophesied in the Old Testament now the thing the good things to come is coming it's here we're just manifestation of it you are children of God God Has Come For You manifesting The Bride in you the hope of glory I should make you shout I don't know about you but when that little lady said I do I was on CL number nine I looked in the mirror and said ha I got Jesus on my side it don't matter about looks it looks it's what's here that counts the beautiness came out and she saw that beauty then she fell in love with this old big old [Applause] guy oh I had some good Lookers but if I would have got one of them I'd have been the most miserable person on the face of this Earth but when he gave me that [Music] woman when she dots her eyes and flops my eyes around I do anything for her cuz I know she's at home she's taking care of the house she's taking care of my dog she's taking care of her daughter she's taking care of things and when I come home I see the hard work that she's doing she tells me I'm so tired I just don't know if I can move another movement well let's go get something to eat boom she's in the car let's go why it's time to bless her it's time to let her be a witness of the things that she has done the good things that she's seen the things that she is responsible for God blesses her God will bless you and so now we all got the Holy Ghost and he's just blessing us like crazy you got a job he's blessing you you got your little house he's blessed you got you a nice pickup nice car he's blessing you you got girlfriends you got a great church he's blessing you way my and she saying I'm blessed by girl you until she says I do then you're blessed but when the Holy Spirit comes down inside of you now he's going to try you now he's going to prove not to himself not to anything except evilness and everybody that has a mind in their mind they're all going off their mind okay if he's going to be a Christian let me see Satan's going to sit there and say Merl you're a biggest liar Merl you this Merl that Merl this Merl that and you're going to sit there and do what the scripture says a norm and you sing the songs of Zion but you're in this trial and you don't know how you're going to get out of it God blessed you and blessed you and blessed you with the this job blessed you this and blessed you with that and blessed you with this and then all of a sudden the blessings stop and now you got to carry on with joy unspeakable and full of glory and he's not there you don't see him you don't feel him but you keep walking you go to church you do everything that possible you can do and nothing's getting right everything things falling apart you don't understand why that God's not doing this he's did this now I have to have this done and this done and it's not happening my house is not getting sold what's going on hun I I I don't know I I I don't know why can't you get a job over there brother William something's going on what's what's happening what's happening all these houses that you got that was a lot cheaper than what you're buying is it's yours and and then you can't get a job so you can't get it then you hear people say well maybe you just ran out there a little too far your pastor says you just walked out there on faith really did you really walk on faith people called me and told me that but I know what he did because it wasn't me I didn't pick the phone call I didn't text them they called me they're the one that choose me I was an eyewitness of it they spoke to me and says we want you as our pastor I know what God told me in main he said prepare yourself I got a work for you to do I come back home and I told those three right there says in a year from now I'm going to be gone I don't know where I'm going but I'm going somewhere one year later a little church needed me need can't even hardly talk make everybody laugh most of the time in the church can't even say my abc is right but I kept going brother wend kept encouraging me my father-in-law kept encouraging me brother Emanuel kept encouraging me my brother kept encouraging me I kept reading my word and it kept it was it was just encouraging me encouraging me and one night coming to church I went to take a shower I looked at my wife and I said dear God's testing us I don't know what he's why he's testing us but he's testing us I don't know how we're going to get there but we're going to get there I go and do the shower and my wife gets a text from her aunt in New Mexico the one that helped me she says how are you guys doing the soon as you can I want you to call me so Sarah said well I got time now I'll call her she goes you got a you got a cousin that has been here and they asked about you how are you guys doing in Arizona and she said they haven't got to Arizona yet she goes they haven't what's going on well it's getting to be winter their house ain't selling he can't get a job because he's not there and things like that I tried even when the signs on those uh internet when I was filling out those applications at the very bottom the very smallest word says if you don't live here don't put an application in but I did it anyway cuz I was trusted but I was in that Valley wondering why is what Lord do I need to get more sincere am I am I doing this wrong or what am I doing wrong she goes she wants to talk to you she wants to help you sh goes well we really appreciate that but she goes no if she wants to help you you better let her help you so Sharon text her she say I'll call you Saturday Saturday come no call Sunday call Sunday come no call Monday night she texts and says can I call you so she calls so she gets on there and goes how you guys doing well we're doing pretty good just packing and you know trying to get ourselves over there she goes well I want to help you she goes I want to buy you guys a house and he said uh what do you mean says I want to buy you a house I want to invest my money in property I don't want to put my money for the government to take my money she I want to invest in something I want to invest in you guys I want to buy you guys a house she say you got two options I will not charge you no interest at all you go find you a house I'll buy it she goes I do not want you to buy no double whites I don't want you to buy any houses that got trash on on the side of it trash around it I want you to be in a nice place so that if you guys ever do finish paying it off or you get to a place that you want to make money you sell it you take the money off of that and go get you something different so she said the first one is you can uh borrow the money from me I'll uh set you up you just just pay it until it's paid for if you want to put your money from the house you can put it on there if you want to if you don't just keep it and use it for something else you just keep paying it until you want to pay it off or rent to own you tell me how much you want to pay down for uh monthly payment in over there is over $250 $2,500 a month for a just a two-bedroom house it's a trailer house house three bedroom two bass you're looking at 3,000 and more I couldn't even afford that she says she goes either one you want to do you do it I said we want to do the rent to own she goes rent it for 5 10 years and then she says after that you can put your money on it and then we can change it over to the other way but I'm still not going to pay you charge you any interest at all and she says when you're ready to buy all the money that you have given me will go on the price and take it off yeah you're doing me a favor by putting my money into something that the government can't touch yeah and you're my family and I want to take care of you God blessed me with all this money I want to bless back nobody called her all that time of going over there and spending money trying to find a job trying to do I was doing it like brother wendle says I was out in faith I'm going to go get a job I was doing everything I could to get over there but see God wanted to be the one that gets the glory he's the one that called me God is the one that told me to go there God has put it on my pastor's heart God is the one that gave me a house he gets all the [Applause] praise I'm not worthy of it but I will tell you this I love my God I want to be a greater witness than I was the day that she says she'll buy me a house because I know my God real my God's real to me he will supply our needs if we can just trust him we've got to stand upon his word if he says something do it if the word tells you to be the best to be best the best be the best the word says get the worldliness out get it out Church don't be that witness of liars that false ones let's be real you don't have to fight your battles you don't have to do anything but trust God he will lead you and guide you and bless you with what you need and when I get brother wle there we're going to dedicate that home to the Lord because he's a part of it you guys are a part of it because you prayed for me you prayed for my girl you listen to me and you seen my heart you were a part of God going on the scene and helping brother William and sister Sharon through the time of need in that Valley where I I knew I wasn't sinning I knew I was right with God I knew I was doing everything right with god brother wend was nervous my father-in-law was nervous when what is going on the Lord's did this Lord's done this Lord's done this but through your prayers through 11 years of Prayer of saints there in Pint top Arizona praying for a pastor all right a winess of good things to come came by their way God loves you Church don't let nobody say that your prayers never be answered they were answered that Sunday that uh Monday night I went last weekend we went and seen five six houses and we picked as a house figured it was going to be a week or so but brothers and sisters sisters the very next day they were already talking about selling it to us we put a bid they counter clocked counter clocked and God's so good he I'm getting all the furniture too brand spanking new furniture with tags on it I'm still Blown Away brand new wash washing machine brand new dryer brand new beds and a snowblower to go on top of that I can get out of my parking [Applause] lot and I gave my wife a castle because God vindicates his children we need to get humble we need the word in our life so strong that nothing will move you when you're in those valleys cuz see sometimes you're in those valleys it's not because you're sinning you're walking in those valleys because God is waiting for the right time to give you a blessing so that you could be a witness of the good things to come God loves you Church brother William loves you and I know I preached hard here sometimes and preach you into heaven and preach you out of into hell and I preach you back into heaven but let me tell you something it's because I loved you all right I know where I come from and sometimes our hardheaded needs to be brought low sometimes we need to be shooking up real good brother W knew how to do it to me I'll always be fa thankful for him thankful for every one of you some of you and I we buted heads some of you buted heads with me but we love each other yes yes yes why because we're Witnesses of that Holy Ghost we're a WI witnessing of the good things to come and as long as you're Christians as long as you're serving God you're going to have more good things to come and you're going to be a part of those comings you're going to be a part of those blessings you're going to have a testimonies of testimonies when you know it's all God and not yourself you can stand on that word and say Satan this is my ground this is my inheritance am get off and he has to get off because why you died out to all the things of this world and you've been baptized in the name of Jesus and you get renewed when you come to church you find out more power you find more goodness you find more grace you find more faith you're in the closet and you're praying and you're seeking God God blesses you he takes the worry out he takes all this out and when I went over there last Saturday a Sunday morning and told them what happened their mouths dropped going oh my goodness and I said the same thing to them as I so told to you guys it was your prayers cuz I'll be honest when I was in that Valley I was trying to make sure I had everything right and I was going through it I was going through it couldn't sleep at night walk in that walk in that it's amazing I don't have to pick up a floor up and put a new floor because I kept walking over and walking over and walking over but it was you that
