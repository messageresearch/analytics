with them be with brother Joe Sandra Lord and and Lord just minister to them Ministry healing even now oh God I'm asking that your anointing would be upon the speaker and the hearer today is my prayer in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here today amen I want to speak for just a just a a few moments this morning on Amen a maybe a a a simple Le subject but amen the title possessing every promise I I'm I'm believing that we are looking here this morning at possessors amen we're we're not Spectators but we're possessors we're not amen um looking for something to come but we are living in the promises of God and I think if we're going to possess it matters what we're looking at and how we're looking at it brother Brandon preached the sermon on look and he says you can be looking at the same thing and yet not seeing the same thing amen you're not perceiving the same thing and so when God says to look unto me all ye ends of the world he is he is calling out to the elect amen and he's and he's and he's telling us amen there there is a there is a Redemption that is going to be coming up amen look to the Redeemer all of the redeemed look to the Redeemer because I am coming to redeem you to restore you to to bring you back can you say amen amen what you see will determine if you're seeing just Christianity as religion that's as far as you will go if you're seeing uh Christianity as just a a a sermon that's as far as you will go but if you see Christianity as Redemption and taking us back where we fell from amen then we will go there can you say Amen so Abraham amen now just to give a little bit of a background Abraham was given the Divine promise that he would possess the land that his seed would possess that land now lot followed Abraham and lot could not see what Abraham saw because uh even though it's the same land even though they were living living on the same property lot had a different eyesight than Abraham had why because Abraham was given Revelation by God lot had not had a revelation by God now I I want us to look at that because if if we're going to possess God's got to reveal to us what we are to possess amen you you there's there's no way you can get there without God revealing himself unto you amen and so we a as as we look there lot followed Abraham but his eyesight was not the same so there come a time when when lot lifted up his eyes amen there there in in Genesis 13 and 10 and and it talks about lot lifted up his eyes and he beheld Sodom and Gomorrah he beheld the well-watered plains he beheld the things of of of of ease and comfort well praise the Lord but you see Abraham's sights never left the word of God God gave him that promise and he would never ever leave that promise amen that's right so so when when and matters of fact when Abraham uh lot departed from Abraham then God appeared unto Abraham and said now you lift up your eyes amen you lift there in the 14th verse and the Lord said unto Abram a after that lot had separated from him lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art all the land you see I'm giving it unto you amen oh aren't you glad for that now lot wanted to see it but lot couldn't see it lot have he come from a different stock he come from a different amen he he was he was looking after the natural Abraham was looking after the promise of God God and I say today that's what separates Church natural from church spiritual amen one is looking at the natural but God has called you and enlightened your eyes to see the supernatural amen yes Abraham was living under a promise he was looking at the Unseen amen and and and you know he wasn't concerned about lot because he knew he was going to possess it all anyways he wasn't concerned about all the all the prestige that lot was going in amen lot's you know so lot's motives was I will take Abraham's motiv was I will give hallelujah amen you see lot going after the ease Abraham chose to stand with the word of God in in the hardships but God came through once lot is finished lot is finished but Abraham's promise was sure secure to his seed well bless the Lord amen Sodom could not take away the faith of Abraham Sodom could not take the faith out of Abraham's seed and I want to say today that the promises of God that get that that fell on the day of Pentecost is still the same promise that God has for you today amen it's the same promise it whatever whatever Pentecost had at the beginning is the promise that you have today now now now we've gone through a Wilderness experience we amen Israel went through 470 years of of uh amen you know you know as they when they come up to kades Baria when God is talking to Joshua there it had been 470 years since the time that God had revealed himself unto Abraham it was it was 470 years amen and since that time now God had already give the land in between that time now they've went into slavery they they amen they dwelt in another land they they they they were not possessors but the time come that God says I'm going to take you back to that original can you say amen and it's been 2,000 years since that original Pentecost since the since the power of the Holy Spirit fell back there in the book of Acts but the promise has been that you are coming back to that original that's what restoration is all about hallelujah amen now if I drop that if I drop that Bible on the floor in order to restore it amen I've got to pick it back up I cannot pick up another book and say this is restoration amen this is replacement this in order to restore I have to pick up the original and and go back well bless the name of the Lord and God didn't say I'm going to give you a replacement he says I'm going to give you the original I'm taking you back to that original experience that original Pentecost that original promise that I gave at the very beginning amen well praise the Lord amen and so if Abraham was told every place the SES of your feet shall trod you shall you you shall have amen then when God appeared unto unto uh uh uh Joshua there as we just read he told him the same thing every place you go the promise is still yours no man shall stand before you nothing shall stand against you you shall possess because the promise is still true Hallelujah the promise is still true it was time to go back somebody say it's time to go back amen Moses had brought them out of Egypt and they had gone through the Wilderness and and God had delivered them you know a mighty hand and and despite Egypt being you know the greatest nation on the earth and though the king had the best of the militaries and though amen it seemed like it was utterly impossible yet the kingdoms of this world could not call back the promise that God had given unto Abraham amen at the very beginning can you say Amen so it's to Abraham and to Abraham's seed that the promise was given to amen now I want you to look at that Hallelujah now now now there the the Bible even talks about you know Paul talked about Pharaoh amen and and he says Amen in the ninth chapter 20th verse and we're just going to break in here amen when he's talking about the king he says NE but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus can you say Amen so so so Pharaoh no matter how how much he had no matter how great an army no matter how great a nation if God gives a promise God Is Bigger Than Pharaoh God Is Bigger Than deception God Is Bigger Than sin God Is Bigger Than sickness God Is Bigger Leia God Is Bigger when God is ready to take you back to where you belong I want to say in this day of restoration there is no devil that can keep you out of it there is no power that can keep you away from it you are the chosen of God you're the ordained of God there is no sin there is no sickness there is no power there's no principalities that can separate you from the power of that Divine promise now Israel had been in the wilderness for 40 years now now they had been going around in circles amen despite God's manifold Miracles a and blessings just as the church has been going around now amen we've we we've gone around the mountain of justification and sanctification and amen we've gone around we've been in and out amen you know struggling to believe and amen and and and and despite everything that God has done through the history of the church it it seems like amen that that that the chanity has has just got to the point where they they just can't believe they amen they want to believe they they want to overcome they they want to conquer the mountain they amen but there's just something in them that's not going to allow them to come all the way back to God's word but but that's not you that's not the elect God has called you to possess now God wouldn't call you to possess if he didn't give you a faith to overcome God wouldn't call you Amen to rise up above it God wouldn't call you and tell you to go across that Jordan and tell you to go kill those Giants and tell you to go do those things if he was not going to anoint you with his holy spirit to do it you're no match for the devil you're no match for this end time but I want to tell you the devil is no match for the power of God that is anointing this Bri the devil is no match for the power of God that rests on the inside of your bosom can you say amen amen I want you to understand unbelief is actually Rebellion against the word of God when God's word says go and unbelief says I can't for you to sit there in that unbelief and say the Giants are too great amen we're not able to take the land is to rebel against the word of God I say tonight there's got or this morning there's got to be a Joshua there's got to be a Caleb that'll stand up and say give me my Mountain well glory to God I feel like possessing mountains this morning I I feel like taking over all of the all of the stuff that the enemy is squatting on I I feel I feel like taking every promise that God has given us amen I will possess that land hallelujah amen now they had chosen the unbelief instead of Faith they grew stagnant amen and complacent and they complained and grumbled about their circumstances Hallelujah we be not able we be not able but I tell you today there's somebody that says we are more than able well praise the Lord hallelujah amen the Joshua Hallelujah the Holy Spirit is here saying come follow me I'll place you in that land amen I I I love it there in in in Deuteronomy amen 11 and 23 it says then will the Lord drive out these nations from before you and you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves and every place where on the sees of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even until the uttermost sea shall be your Coast amen and what did God tell there in Joshua 1 and2 every place The Souls of your feet shall tread upon now if you'll notice he is telling Joshua the leader that but in Deuteronomy he's telling the church that Joshua is the leader that's taking him into the promise but in Deuteronomy God is talking to the church and says if you follow the leader I've given you you shall possess you shall take greater Nations than you you shall in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you'll speak in new tongues in my name I will Empower you to possess well glory to God hallelujah amen I say there's a deep fire this morning that is burning in the bosom of Abraham's seed saying I must possess now you say now brother W I'm so thankful I'm so thankful for what God done in the meeting but I'm just afraid I I'm going to slip back or right you know maybe I didn't get everything that I was after I want to tell you it's not dependent on six preachers it's not dependent on any one man it's not dependent on A Gifted Man it's not dependent on a man that has Visions or a man that dreams dreams it's not dependent upon a prophesier it is dependent upon one thing and that is the one that gives you that promise amen he gave the promise I don't care whether you're all alone and there's no one else to call the word of God is still yours and you can possess I don't care whether you're feeling out and everyone is forsaken you you can take the word of God for yourself and possess every

started coming up in Luther started coming up in W they kept on coming on up Amen in Pentecost and here we are you know why can't we believe God's promise why can't we believe the Supernatural is Among Us why can't we see the supernat well praise the Lord amen he says that's right he says you better get in there quick if you're going I'm fixing the cloth in just in 5 10 minutes amen he says notice the great masterp of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be they if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way the husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and that's what God's Masterpiece amen uh that was that was God's Masterpiece and now all the true

himself in the bride Alpha Omega hallelujah amen the the Omega Church oh has passed by once again now now in the middle brother bradam he man he said now uh uh there was a voice that says now we will rever re review the churches they come I noticed them coming up and when they come up each one of them look like got worse i' never seen such filthy bunch in my life and he said next and I heard a noise and and oh here comes that American group and and he says now I'm an American and but but this made me sick I I'm not eloquent enough to in in a mixed audience to say what was taking place you you'll have to read between the lines but the women were coming the leader of them was a witch and she had a long nose and a big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes uh down here just a top uh uh just a strap and just a little half inch strap and that moved up and went went around like this and then each of the women had something on order on an order and many of you years ago you you used to remember when we used to cut the old paper you know the newspaper and make a fly bush and and how many remembers it he says you know I think it was used in carnivals you know and hanging down frch paper lace paper and they they were holding something like that below them like this and and holding below them and all their parts was exposed and each one of had hair cut up real short and frenzy looking uh things all over it like that and real shortcut hair full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like a street prostitute and they were walking with this paper in the vulgarity and the paper was what was holding in in front of them and and when they passed the review stand in the back of them to where they were going in in their foremost in their back part how they were acting and I said is this the church oh my is this the church now now brother Bram is looking he's sick to his stomach and he says out of all all that I've done every all of my preaching everything that we have tried to do and this is all that I've got to present to you is this everything and he and he and he and we we go on down and she says and there she went they were singing this here twist and Rose songs and you you know whever what you call it and singing and going and and I said is that the church I was standing there in my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion is nothing else in the world but she is the World Council of churches leading them right down the road where she was going and they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos and still beating the music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies on one side and then on the other and and carrying on like that and as I started to bow my head he said wait the bride must come again oh church if you if you only had hope in what we're seeing outside here you would you would have a sick stomach too because the elect of God is longing for Purity and Holiness and godliness and Promises of God oh come on Church they'll never have the promise of God they're trying to take care of everything in the natural they're the lots of this world but the vision goes on and the and the one beside him says amen now he says wait the bride must come again I looked and here they come again they passed by sweet looking little ladies they all had uh uh they was all looking right at me as they passed I noticed each one was dressed difference one in in the back had kind of had long hair hanging down had it rolled around like this and might have been a German or something and I watched them as they as they started leaving two or three of them in the back started getting out of shape or out of step and I was going to holler at them and was trying to get them back in step and I seen them as the vision just faded out and changed from me amen another place he he says now I've seen all the different ones there amen they were from all the nations of the world he says this was the church now watch he says now here is the interpretation of it amen KN not knowing until a few moments ago amen he says I look uh look like just recently see did did you notice the Bride come into view twice the seed and the second seat both of them exactly the same the reason they were dressed in different parts she come from All Nations and it'll make up the bride each one had long hair no makeup real pretty girls they were watching me and they represent the bride coming out of all the nations each one representing a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word of God can you say Amen so what was God trying what was God showing brother brandom there's coming there's coming another bride she's not a replacement but she is of the same bones same word Same Spirit same anointing as the first so the Alpha and the Omega has has has come back together again you know that's that's an amazing thing Hallelujah do you know that your completion according to the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter that your Perfection your completion will bring the dead of the last 2,000 years back up from the graves do you realize that your faith that you are standing in and the and the pent and the Pentecostal blessings that God is restored to us will literally the power of Pentecost will raise up the dead once again yeah praise the Lord hallelujah there's no one after you to come you're the church there's not an eighth age there's only one age can you sayen now what are we doing we are taking the word of God and we're believing it for what it says hallelujah we're believing it Hallelujah now if if God wants to do something and something happens that's not in the Bible I guess that's fine but I'm here to tell you I I I I'm I'm just I'm just going to believe all the promises that God's put right here in this book I the restoration faith has come to believe whatsoever things God has wrote you well can you say Amen man now in Pentecost we used to oh my oh we we we it was such a roller coaster ride we were up and down and in and out and we always looking for somebody I I sat on the front row you know amen and I I was always always praying every every service God send somebody with with uh a word of knowledge for me give somebody a vision for me Lord show I I need to hear from you and God was good to me amen God God would uh uh lots of times times God would send somebody and say the Lord laid you on my heart and and and and and it would so encourage me it would be so wonderful amen but what I found is that I was dependent upon somebody else's Faith somebody else's gift somebody else's amen uh spiritualness to help me I need and when and and and then it it only worked for so long and then I was back down in the Molly grubs again I was I was back down again but you see amen when you come over into the new land it is your land it's not some gifted man's land it's not some preachers land it's not some no no no no it is your land and you have been commissioned by God God said every place the SES of your feet shall Trad upon shall be yours he didn't say Amen go find somebody that that that that can prophesy to walk on your land he didn't say Amen go get somebody amen that that that that is a Gifted Man thank God for all the gifts I believe in the gifts how many believes in the gifts but we're not looking at the gift uh the gifts we're looking at the Gift Giver I'm not following a man I'm not following a spirit well praise the Lord if you're looking to me amen and you're depending on me and you're wanting me you're depending on my spirituality I mean I'll pray for you I love you I appreciate you but that is not what God has in mind God has you in mind possessing your own land oh come on that's what this church is we're not following a witch we're following the power of the Holy ghosten that's right now amen we we want to look it's it has been coming amen the bear seed was sewn in the ground up come a little blade then there come the little stock then there come the little tassel then there come the Shu Hallelujah but the seed has to rise what's in the seed the seed is everything that went into the ground Jesus said except the corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abides alone he's talking about him s I've got to go into the ground but if I don't leave if I don't Ascend on high amen you're going to be looking to me all the time instead of the Holy Spirit coming back upon you and overcoming the mountains yourself through the Hallelujah Jesus says that's not that's not the way it is he says now I'm going up there to intercede for your faith I'm going to send the comforter back to you I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost H so that you can defeat the Devil anywhere anytime under any condition Hallelujah can you say amen amen God's been expecting those seeds amen Jesus Christ died Jesus Christ gave his life but the and he and he and he and he went to the grave and he took care of the sin problem he has ascended back upon High what is his desire that the life of God that was in Jesus to come back in the church and bring many sons like himself unto Glory I'm I'm fixing to start preaching myself happy about right now amen oh yes amen we come back the Royal seed Jesus Christ the the Royal Seed of Abraham amen he planted he was he was planted he died the life that was in him came up through that weath plant and now there's a people that says I'm not staying in this Wilderness anymore I've got a faith to rise that's right the Bible says Caleb was of a different Spirit yes sir Caleb was of a different spirit and he rose up and he says I will possess what glory to God can you say Amen so it's not in the good it's not in it's oh thank God thank God man I love I I love to shout amen I'm probably one of the one of the biggest am manners here in the church I love it amen and I I I you know what I've got something in my heart I I'm going to let the preacher know that I I I love it Hallelujah I I I just I just love it I love singing I love rejoicing I'm just one of those kind of guys that sort of wears my feelings on my sleeve you know amen I I I just I everyone knows what I am when they're looking at me amen but you see amen that that's not that's not that's not me that that that's that those things are all good but sometimes I don't feel like I don't feel like shouting sometimes I don't feel like amen and sometimes I don't feel like well praise the Lord but the promise is still the same and I've got to stand upon the word of God and believe that promise regardless and stand upon that word hallelujah amen so sometimes I'm shouting when I don't feel like shouting sometimes I'm saying amen when I don't feel like I am not letting my feelings dictate me I I am coming amen I'm just trying this mic here amen it seemed like it's going in and out doesn't it hallelujah amen but you but the the the promise of God is is is yes it's true it's Amen and the Holy Spirit now remember now if we're going to go by the emotions and we're going to go around the cycles and we're going to go and we're and we're just going from revival to Revival then we're still in the wilderness if we're just going to go from move of God to move of God Miracles and things like we're just going to keep on we just we're going to keep on going around in the wilderness and that's not God's design that God is Not Hallelujah don't put a mailbox in the wilderness you got to get on the other side and claim your Mountain then put your mailbox amen get on that side of Jordan claim what God God's given [Applause] you is that right amen you got to claim what God what God's given you there now amen so we when we looked when we looked and and I wish we were having a little bit of a you know a little bit of a a talk yesterday and and and on the amen you know the the Pentecostal experience I'm all four I'm all four uh gifts I'm all for the manifestations I'm all I'm all for amen uh the the the uh the wonderful things of God but I want to tell you you are never to look to the gifts amen now we need those gifts they keep us clean they they they they purify our souls there uh uh the Bible says or brother brandom says he says you the in the adopted Church there will be the gifts and he says and it'll keep that church clean that's right and anas and Sur fire is will start dying again and there will be a lot of things going on Amen the church there will be a fear brought back into the church is that right it's not in the hitting and the missing and the ups and the downs and this that and the other no no no no no no no no our we are going into that Land Of Promise where he is establishing us into the power of that Divine Holy Spirit to conquer Every Mountain every devil in our in in our way can you say Amen conquering amen hallelujah hallelujah well someone says well we don't need the Holy Ghost anymore and brother Wendell I don't really like you talking about the gifts and I don't really like listen listen listen with the Holy Spirit comes the gifts and brother bradam says that the true genuine working of the Holy Spirit could not happen through those 2,000 years because the Holy Spirit had been bound at the at the door of Creeds amen amen he he says he says this he says now he says also the church has been bound has bound that church for 2,000 years has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under martym back there and under the church ages it's been bad not at the river of Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of some man-made system but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said and those two meet one another in the Battlegrounds Lucifer and and and and Michael amen like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years amen uh and and he and and he goes on down and and he says uh he says the Holy Spirit has been bound by those denominational Rivers almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human FES well glory to God oh what they had in the book of Acts what they had in the first there's coming a church that the holy spirit is going to take control of in the last well I'm glad to be a part Alpha has become Omega ah you're not a wanabe you're not a GNA be you are sons of God now now that's what John said back there in the first church he says beloved now are we the sons of God it was not we're going to be it never said you're going one of these days and that same holy spirit is back in the church and I'm standing up here saying beloved now are we the sons of God hallelujah amen sons of God aren't you glad for that amen what what did the scripture say Amen Jesus says he says there in thir uh Matthew 13 and 16 blessed are your eyes for they see your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not amen heard them that's right amen they they they were longing to see it they were wanting to see it but they never could see it Hallelujah and I say that this Wilderness church member experience has long and long and long they long to see the power of God come come back into full Authority in The Believer there was a Few Good Men right yes now now now hear me and and I'm and I'm not going to hold you too much longer this morning this is this just just sort of preaching my my my heart for a few moments and but you look look in the old look look look past this day let's go beyond brother brandham and let's let's let's look Beyond look in the history there was Smith Wigglesworth a man that people look to there were there there were great men the Billy Sundays there were uh uh uh Knox and and and these these these great great men of Faith but it was sporadic because the Holy Spirit could not rest on the church as a whole God would raise up certain men with that were gifted but in the last day God didn't just Raise Up A Gifted Man he sent us a Joshua to position Us in that land so that well praise the Lord in the wilderness there was only a few gifted men that would come in amen there was there were 70 that were anointed to prophesy there and they helped with Moses right yes sir and there was all the bickering and all the fusting and all the fighting all through that that the Wilderness all in that church amen hallelujah but Joshua came to put the people on their land so that they could possess their promise so that they could take their Mountain so they could build their house oh come on church amen and so it has been All Through the Ages we've had great men rise up and they were wonderful but our Prophet did not come to pull to himself the gift of God came in his life to get the people's attention so that they would believe him that's right the angel says if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer he said there's going to be the first pool it's going to be healing there's going to be the second pool pull it's going to be discernment all right but then there's going to be a third pull and it's going to be the bride's inheritance the first pull was William bram's gift second poll was William bram's gift amen that's never been promised to you but in that third poll was when the book was open and you were commissioned take that book oh come on Church take that book someone and say well the ride's got a first pull and a second pull that ain't my yet that you you can gimmick that that's what they tried to do outside there they tried to gimick it man trying to hold the hand old Roberts had power in his right hand and then there was everybody had all these Powers everyone was looking to men that wasn't the purpose the purpose was not to look at William brandham yes God was with him and gave him those two pulls so that the world would know that God was with him but his commission was to open those seals that's declare those seals as the lamb opened them can you say amen amen and what's that to do to empower you to go to your Mountain possess what you want I'm no longer subject to emotionalism I'm no longer subject Amen to the ups and downs or the gifts or this that and the other I am in possession of every word of God Hallelujah do I love it when someone prophesies over me or has Visions I sure do and some people say well that don't happen anymore well I'm sorry it happens to me it does amen hallelujah i' I've had prophecies over me just in the last this year people's had Visions amen over me and I accept him I'm not building my house house on it that's not my promise my promise Is possessing the gates of the enemy but I guarantee you it's a wonderful thing to have I love hearing from the Lord I love someone coming and saying I feel like the Lord's got something for you come on I was out I was out going amen when I was out you know I I I got a I got a an an obsessive personality and uh man you know addictive type personality and uh I I get I get on something and buddy I'll just I I'll go you know and uh uh so I'd got doing those shoes and uh man we had one truck we started a little truck and little trailer and then then got me then got me another a U-Haul and then I got another U-Haul and then I got a a big old dly big old 30 something foot trailer and goose neck and and I'm I'm I mean I'm I'm just man I'm I'm counting the dollar signs and uh dad says Wendell I I don't I don't really know if that's really the Lord's will for you you you're a pastor I said oh Dad I can I can do this I I I can I can handle this you know I got a phone call I got a phone call from from somebody not even around here he says and I mean they were Stern they said brother Wendell I was woke up this morning with a and and and with with with grieved in my spirit that you would put things in front of God you will be held accountable and I mean he's he's just laying it on me he says and then when he's through all right good day and I'm going whoa so I'm wondering what's going on and brother I'm going to tell you right now before you know it my little world started crumbling one of my trucks were stolen I just I just put 20 something thousand do worth of inventory in that stolen up there in Omaha Nebraska amen lost that the other truck that I had you know 12 $15,000 worth of merchandise was in Oklahoma City and it was left out in the rain uh and and and ruined everything in that praise the Lord and before you know it I wasn't smirking at that little admonition prophecy or whatever it was I are you hearing me it got my attention the Lord was letting me know that hey this ain't just happening on accident right so I believe in those things but I don't base my decisions on those things I don't base my I don't base my relationship with God on those things those things come and and got my attention and if I would have examine my heart I would have known that it was God talking to me well glory to God y y'all understanding what I'm saying but you see but you see I I don't base my myself salvation on that I base it upon the promises of God and I want to tell you right now if you're standing on every word and with every word I think there'll be a lot of shouting going on in the church I believe there will be a lot of things I still believe God speaks in tongues I still believe God does all those things God still performs Miracles God still does signs God still does the whole thing he does it all he is still God amen praise the Lord I think there should be some excitement in the house of God I think there's can you say Amen you know why buddy when you're killing Giants and you're standing on their heads or you're holding on to the head and you got you got you got your big old gl's head amen and you're holding it up buddy that that you that that's bragging material right there that's rejoicing material right there hallelujah hallelujah am why because you're Victorious you're possessing the land God's called you to this it is yours you have a right to that I say today whatever they had in the first is what the um uh whatever they had in the Omega is what they're going or in the alpha is what they're going to have in the Omega they spoke in tongues in the alpha they're going to speak in tongues in the Omega they had Prophecy in the alpha they'll have Prophecy in the Omega they had overcoming power there people dropping dead in the Omega the alpha there'll be people dropping dead in the Omega because we're getting closer to the Lord and there's going amen we've got to stand up every word of God that's amen praise the Lord as the musicians come Hallelujah aren't you glad for that now what did God say e Ephesians Ephesians 3 and 2 says if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given me to you word how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a forign few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men but is now made but is but is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and the prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel can you say Amen now amen I I think about the power of this that is to come the atonement is is is a powerful thing the atonement has removed every hindrance or every resistance or every it's it's bulldozed the every wall that separated you and God the blood of Jesus is God's tide it's God's detergent it's God's [Music] bleach and the blood of Jesus so washes all the all your sins that you can be so sinful here this morning and a minute later you can be totally clean with absolutely no stains on you you can be so totally washed from your defilement the blood of Jesus is so pure so powerful and I know they claim that you this
