========================================

[Music] is should choose for me [Music] oh [Music] praise the lord god bless you it's good to see you all here amen when you have weather like we've had and a day yesterday like we had you appreciate each one who was able to make it in we're gonna let you be seated for just a minute and say god bless you it's very very good to have you here um i told you wednesday that we were gonna have brother john come and give us just a little quick report on his trip over to japan and let us know what's going there so we'd like for him to come at this time and take five minutes or so and then we'll stand and sing another song and go into the word god bless you brother john god bless you everybody it's good to be home and really nervous as usual so just pray for me my wife says my voice gets real high when i get nervous so i apologize in advance uh this is uh my second time to japan so uh it was just a real blessing i unfortunately wasn't able to go with brother craig this time but since it was such a short trip um you know we had brother danny and brother nestor heading over there they're just in a one-time zone apart and so i think brother craig's lord willing is planning on going again in may during golden week so um it was kind of nice the just the last minute when i was booking the flights you know it just had a little check about flying into narita and i realized you know brother danny and esther are flying into a different airport and so i kind of read it at the last minute and uh got a decent price and everything but i was able to meet everybody right there in hanita so this is just us when we first got there i took some pictures and we ended up arriving about within five minutes of each other so it was a real blessing we had um we had brother junior here on the on the far right and then brother emil next to him and of course brother nestor and brother danny and sister ruth on the far left there and they're always there to greet us and to you know take us around and be excellent hosts went back to hotel jose kind of came in the afternoon there and was able to rest up the next day we were able to meet with some of the believers there uh sister landland in the front here of course you just fireball for the lord and uh we were able to sing some songs and uh brother junior actually had a this isn't the same guitar he had a little backpacker it was just a little tiny guitar that we had right there at the at the hotel and just were able to sing some songs and had a little discussion heard some stories from brother nestor and all of his missions trips it was just a real blessing junior is a just uh he's kind of like a brother franco and uh you know just every all these brothers that do so many things he does everything there so he's the technical guy he's the music guy he's he's just uh just a real servant for the lord and i believe the lord's got something special for him so we're praying for brother junior just a sweet brother and of course the very next day we head down to the camp in yokohama so uh everywhere you go it's either a taxi or a train or a bus and uh just totally different than what you're used to you know once we got down to the camp this is the group that had gathered there most of them you probably know from before but there was you know brother ruse and sister emil are always reaching out always witnessing and so there's a few folks that they had just talked to that that invited to the camp and were able to come and enjoy the messages and and some of the fun things we were able to do here we actually made mochi so i know whether nathan probably would appreciate this but we're pounding mochi here and it's quite the exercise it's just a short grain rice that uh you you work it you steam it and you you uh mash it and then you pound it and it becomes a real kind of a interesting gooey gummy kind of a it it sounds i'm making it sound bad but it actually was very good of course it it kind of had a smell like uh cream of wheat but the basically this this bowl here has some some of the toppings so you'd roll this into different types of toppings so there was a soy flour and a i think a sesame seed and a sweet bean and so it just kind of goes with a little bit of everything so it's quite a treat there this is brother fedomar and his wife grace and their little daughter gianna she's just cute as a button i know my my little daughter fell in love with her too so but uh brother fed is actually from the philippines and uh the lord's placed him there for work and while he's there he's been helping the believers there with bible studies every week and he and brother emile are kind of taking back and forth and preaching a little bit and so they're they've done their first communion just recently and it's been really good so brother fed's just been a huge blessing we had another treat we had this i believe it's called adabo it's a filipino dish it's actually this chicken on top of the rice it's a special barbecued style so we had a little of that and we had some japanese curry in the back and some vegetables that all the food there was really good i just really enjoyed myself only had one little incident and it wasn't anything major just they kind of told me after you know we had a little last day we were there we went to a authentic japanese restaurant and on the side and they had a little sushi underneath some stuff you know and so i'm like well you know i'll try it it's i'm not big on sushi but uh but it was actually very very good and you know after you get past the thought of i'm eating raw fish it was very good but the food was just excellent and uh the next morning i i found out that well you're really supposed to drink a little green tea or maybe a little uh wine or something to kill that stuff that you've just eaten i'm like well that would have been nice to know the night before so anyway of course brother uh brother nestor there uh he he he opened up the uh the tabernacle of god and typed it to the to the christian and uh it was just a real blessing to the camp there and then brother danny spoke uh the next day um i'm sorry we had two services there at the camp the very next day this is the very next day we took a picture of everyone there that was that was left anyway and uh before they'd all lead headed out we ended up uh taking a train again and several of the believers came back with us to funebori this is this is nearer to tokyo and this is sister zhang jing on the left here she's always supporting the meetings always in attendance she's a chinese sister that's been in japan for many years and been in the message for a few years and and uh just a real godly sister and we're just glad to have her in our meetings and sister ruth of course sister ruth is is the primary japanese translator at this point we've she's always been there especially in the tokyo area she's they're living in yokohama and they've always been faithful to come and translate on the trains this is uh brother danny and brother nestor of course and on the right here is brother brother mark raito and he's also a philippine brother and i think the chad had mentioned that they had a a uh song leader there from the philippines and so he's gifted in leading worship and and so he's been a real blessing to the believers there he's there for school and work i think he's working on his doctorate so um this these are the meetings in funaburi uh we kind of you know brother brother danny made the the type about you know we we've kind of messed up the room you know we came in it was everything was perfect it wasn't set up really good for services so so we kind of moved all the tables around and shifted all the chairs around and finally you know brother brother danny at the end of the services uh you know i said there he preached on the restoration uh the message of restoration and he says you know this room we've got it all messed up but before we can leave here we've got to get it all restored and so it's just a beautiful thing and i really i really appreciated brother nestor's teaching it's just back to the fundamentals and the basics and it just blesses you all over again he went through the church ages and spent you know one service about two and a half hours uh the first three church ages and uh so we had a full day this was on sunday and we had this the services from nine in the morning till nine in the evening it's a full solid day of services um sister landland again with her daughter yusi she's about i think she's about 13 years old and on the far uh left of course is sister sister jung jing again and then in the middle uh next to sister jung jing his sister naomi this is rusin emil's daughter she's been translating perfect english perfect japanese and so she's just she helps out a lot during the preaching so she'll she'll she'll uh and i believe she's also beginning to translate messages so uh next to her is sister rebecca and she is also a japanese translator but she's also chinese so she she was translating into chinese for the chinese believers that were there and this is her little sister winner and she's about 14 i believe so again we're going back into the seven church ages and extremely long day brother brother nestor i believe was extremely tired and i know we had our meals right there in the room we hardly left it all all day but at the end of the day you know brother nestor had preached his heart out he was just spent but you know at the very end of the service brother danny was talking about the message of restoration and was wanted to go into some question and answers we thought well we'll break and we'll come back well instantly you know questions start coming up right then and so we just kind of kept going rather danny was rolling with it brother nestor said no he's doing a great job i'm going to sit here this brother is brother george now brother george is a nigerian he's a pastor and he's starting a church there in japan another brother that bruce and emil have witnessed to and uh he wanted to come and join the program that we that we had at the camp and he liked what he heard so much he said well you know i have to pastor the church on sunday but maybe i can come some day sunday afternoon and so he came for the for the services sunday afternoon and just he said he was extremely blessed and he had a lot of questions and so he started asking questions you know what about the the foolish virgin what about the you know the trinity and what about the baptism and and so it was just really good and we had i had a little interview with him afterwards and he just thoroughly enjoyed himself he said he's really gonna dig into the we gave him a little usb stick that had everything on it has all the messages from 62 on it has all the text it has all the sermons that everybody has preached in tokyo up to this point brother franco has done an amazing job of cramming all this stuff on a little thumb drive and and so i appreciate brother franco and uh so pray for brother george he's he's seeing things for the first time and he's just uh really excited about it so of course the end of the the day we're extremely tired so naturally we went to denny's so denny's is our our favorite hangout and so uh the next day of course we had a little down time i was extremely tired and i slept in that morning and kind of missed our breakfast and uh brother nestor and brother danny went out and and uh were able to see tokyo a little bit and the next day of course we're heading out to the airport to leave and of course brother emile and sister ruth met us there always there to to greet us and uh so this was right before we leave on the airplane they came and visited with this fellowship just had some testimonies and told us a little bit about the their previous church and those kind of things is just a real blessing you know we we got there it was about in the 50s i mean it was really nice and of course brother nestor and brother danny are from the tropical zone and they're all shivering bundle up with you know scarves and hats and we ended up having to make a stop to get long johns at the local mall you know and uh and so you know it was it was a it was kind of an interesting thing but but you know i told him it was probably a lot colder here and so i was kind of excited about it i was kind of open jacket and having a good time but you know we realized i'd like to read a little scripture in first timothy 6 and verse 19 it says laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life and it's talking about uh the rich how they lay up i believe we're spiritually rich people and i believe that was the emphasis of this trip was laying up food for the japanese believers and so you know sometimes i feel like it's an insignificant part to uh to just go and take some footage but really that footage comes back brother franco works tirelessly for months to put all that together to be able to send it back over and for the believers to be able to feed on that and you know it's uh it's just a tremendous blessing and it's exciting to see how you know we've we've started to give them the message in their in their hands and they've started to eat it up and started to translate i believe just since we were there last there was another six or seven messages that they translated so we're just praying for more translators praying for the lord to just open the doors and it's a just a monumental task when you think about how many there are but really you know there's god knows exactly what he's doing um you know i've kind of been ignoring my notes but uh something something i appreciated was you know the they're they're uh they obviously are are very hungry and they're they're also streaming services sometimes to stream our services or other brother services and i realized when i was there that you know when when we pull on the gift that god's given us it doesn't just bless us but it blesses those that are online that are going to see this later and it's a huge blessing so remember that you know we're not just pulling for us we're pulling for everyone that might get that see i believe god's given us this gift for a purpose and i believe it's not just for us so um some amazing things right now in japan in in april there the current emperor is actually going to abdicate he's going to step down before he dies this is the first time this has happened in almost forever this this family i believe has ruled since 660 bc and so this emperor is stepping down making huge waves uh everybody's unsure they're uncertain about the political landscape they're they're expecting good things but summer summer you know just a lot of turmoil about it and uh shortly after this in april the end of april this is when the golden week i know brother brother uh with craig will be going about that time this is when the transition is going to happen and uh shortly after that is when the pope was going to be visiting japan so we also knew they've told us that every time the missionary brothers have come there's always been earthquakes it's kind of in the earthquake zone but there's always been earthquakes while they're there and there was some there were some minor earthquakes while we were there this time but not only that we also had a comet not a comet but a an asteroid that came through brother brother dean pointed this out to us that in the south of japan streaked across the sky is extremely bright you can look it up online i was going to try to put a little video on here but if you look it up online the japanese fireball and it was a huge fireball come across the sky you know we don't really know i don't want to say i know what these things mean but i know that the lord's doing something in japan and so i'm just excited for the people there i'm excited that i was able to be a part of it and i appreciate there's been so many of you that are that have told me specifically that you appreciate uh me going and you've been praying for me and just so many who just told us how they were praying for the services there and praying for our trip and i really appreciate that i appreciate brother chad for giving us the opportunity to go and i just pray that you would support the missions i pray to just pray for the people of japan and i really appreciate this time i'm just going to turn it back over to brother chad thank you so much god bless you let's all stay look at stan i appreciated that i love the updates you know so many times people go and they come and things happen and you don't always get a good scope of what's going on and i'm sure brother john probably feels totally inadequate to share with you exactly what it's like what you feel and what you experience but i thankful for the taste that we got amen and i'm thankful that he took the time to share that with him and for the support i'm thankful for the work that he does amen it's not easy to leave your family and take the flights and and when john's there he's working the whole time he's not just sitting back and relaxing even when people are eating meals he's catching pictures of people eating their meals in video so his job is there to record everything and he does a fantastic job we appreciate that and like i said before we appreciate brother franco for the all the hours he puts in just to make sure that all that was gained is not lost that it goes back and they can chew on it again and these things are wonderful and we appreciate your support your prayer support and all that appreciate brother john's family being willing and able to do without him for a week while he goes it's a team effort we all work together we just appreciate you all and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to john chapter 5 and i would like to sing a song together as we turn there but what was that song you mentioned yeah i sing this song all he wants is you [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] he wants all of your hearts all he wants is is [Applause] oh want all of your heart all i want is all of you [Music] praise the lord thank you thank you let's turn to john chapter five we're going to continue on where we've been and search the scriptures this is now part six and we want to look at the the life of rahab amen and we'll just pray that the lord leads us and whatever he wants comes out amen we want to yield ourselves completely to him and we just want to thank you all for coming today and making your way through the snow and we know it was much worse even further south and especially if you get south of i-70 so there's a lot that couldn't make it and we just trust that they're streaming in which means everybody here has to pull double duty pooling amen because amen the ones that are streaming are depending the ones that couldn't come in and are tuning in are depending on us amen and i'm just appreciate each one of you and we're thankful for you being here also i want to say thank you to brother jim rast but the gym rest started plowing snow last night at midnight and worked all night and he thinks i think he's at home in bed right now but we can say god bless by the gym we appreciate him very much also appreciate blake and and david they came over and cleared the sidewalks this morning and it's just wonderful we can walk in the church and we can be here and we appreciate everybody who does their part amen let's read this scripture together we're going to read 2 and then we'll let you be seated chapter 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me now if we could go back to luke if you turn with me back to luke 24 i'd like to read one scripture out of luke 24 we know this is the as the road to emmaus just one verse verse 27 and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded to them all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen so starting back at the beginning at genesis moses the first five books of the bible and all the prophets that's all the word he expound unto them and in all the scriptures all right we have to understand he didn't just tell them all the scriptures that concern him no it says he expounded unto them in all the scriptures he took the entire bible to date for his text amen i like jesus on the road to the mass i'd like to take for my text the entire bible that's what jesus did on the road to emmaus amen it says beginning at moses and all the prophets expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself that means he went back in every type and in every shadow and in every character he started pulling out amen the things that was concerning him that was in all the scriptures how many would have liked to been on that trip we've been on a similar one friends we've walked this road with a prophet in this day and let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this time that we have with you oh god we pray now that you would come down lord and and take complete control of this vessel standing behind this desk lord we don't want to hear the thoughts of a man we don't want to hear the words that come from from a man's mind but we're here to hear from you lord and you have chosen the foolishness of preaching and we accept that way lord and we trust you in it we just pray that you would do what not the natural things but the supernatural things this morning that you would speak through these lips of clay that you would take a gift that you've ordained and placed inside a vessel and that you would pick it up lord with your own hands and you would begin to break the bread of life and open our eyes that we might see you lord we might see you in us in this day we might understand like we've never understood before the revelation of what's going on we trust you and ask you have preeminence in all of us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated if we could turn to matthew chapter one we just want to read the beginning matthew chapter one again i'd like to say wednesday night we we looked into the life of tamar and i realize as we move on from taymor that we could probably stay there for quite some time there's so many little nuggets in there and and i'll tell you this and and it's probably absolutely the truth i believe it to be the truth but if time continues on as it is and god allows us to remain in this condition without the translation of the body we'll come back to this and understand it better i mean we looked through tamar and all of a sudden things were popping out and it was amazing that we could see those church ages right there in genesis 38 it was amazing the things that were there but what's more amazing to me is the things that's still hidden there and you know it's there but you can't make anything up you can't pretend you can't take your own intellectual knife and whittle something down and make it fit in a place that doesn't belong we can't do that and so until revelation comes you just have to leave it alone you can read it and you can look over it but how many times have we read it and looked over and never saw what was laying right there in plain view i mean it's like we're walking over diamonds that are laying on the ground and we haven't realized that they're diamonds amen and one day it just strikes you funny you're at a certain angle the light hits just right it sparkles a certain way and you realize that's a diamond i've been walking past for years and that's what's happening as we walk through the scriptures amen i've said it like this as the eagles catch an updraft they just begin circling amen and every time you circle you go higher so you go back through tamar again you just go higher you go back through the shadows and types and you just go higher more revelation more revelation deeper understanding something moving from our head to our hearts amen and becoming who we are and so so we move on from tamar not because we're done but because we're moving on because we're following the spirit amen but i'm sure we'll go back at some point so let's read in matthew chapter one starting at verse one the book of the generations of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharas so that's where we were talking last time pharaz and zarah of tamar and phara has begot ezram and ezra and begot abraham see what we're following now is we're following the line of the princes of judah amen in the each generation there's a prince in judah and out of them is coming another prince and another prince and another prince and this is the generation of jesus christ and the natural as he's coming down this natural lineage of judah because we learned wednesday that the scepter was in judah the governor the ruler must come from judah and so we can see that god is doing something special in judah and we saw through tamar how he brought in this woman and and how you know she has to go through these three stages but never receives the seed till she comes to the fourth and the fourth stage is not another son amen we know these stages were justification sanctification the baptism of holy ghost and these were all works of the holy ghost right justification is the work of the holy ghost sanctification is the work of the holy ghost the baptism holy ghost is a work of the holy ghost amen but she's not coming to another work of the holy ghost but she's coming back to the holy ghost itself not to another son not to another work not to another stage of grace and remember she's gone through the stages of grace through the three sons and now she's coming back to the grace giver amen not a stage of grace but back to life itself back to the originator of the sons back to judah and in that she produces another prince in judah pharas so out of her comes fair as the continuation of this lineage where the scepter must rise out of comes through this whole scenario and we can see so clearly now that it's just the church ages on display it's just the coming of the bride it's just more so as we begin to look through here amen it's always going to be this way and as you look through the shadows and types amen can you imagine like we said on the road to emmaus that beginning at moses and all the prophets amen he showed them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning himself so he shows them in all the scriptures but they're not just repeating scriptures they're not just repeating stories something different happens in each shadow something different happens in each time and it's pointing out other aspects of himself amen other traits other characteristics so that he can be fully identified because brother ben said he was always letting the secret out amen he was constantly unfolding the secret but never letting it out in full through moses and through david and through all these ones they were all showing it in a type they were showing a different aspect of redemption a different aspect but they could never show the whole thing until jesus himself comes and he can show the whole thing and the same thing with the revelation of the bride amen each one is showing a type or a portion they're telling the same story over and over but each one's painting with different colors amen and never could the whole thing been shown until you get to the capstone of this masterpiece this mystery masterpiece which is a masterpiece family amen and the masterpiece wasn't finished when jesus was expressed on earth and went to calvary no that was the first part of the masterpiece family that was fully expressed but out of him was taking a piece off of the original and began to form amen another amen masterpiece another part of the masterpiece which is the woman amen because it's a masterpiece family so christ is the masterpiece but it's christ male and female makes up the masterpiece all the way back amen to the mystery laying in genesis chapter 1 of the man and the woman and the masterpiece so now along now as we look back amen we look back at all the scriptures in all the scriptures if the bridegroom is there the bride's there too this is such an interesting thing we've come amen at the end of time when we thought that we've had thousands of years to study the bible we've come through the man age amen and when you come through the man age it was god giving men wisdom amen to print the bible to get to the interpretation of the bible to bring us out of the of the of the death camp of the catholic church doing away at the bible so god sent an anointing amen which is the was a man anointing which is the intelligence of a man so that he can print bibles read bibles amen and break that stronghold of the catholic church but the problem is they went too far on that anointing and refused the eagle anointing and wanted to stay with the intellect and wisdom of a man and began to then interpret the word by intellect god gave him that anointing to bring him back to the written word to move him away from superstition to move him away from fairy tales that the church had made up and come back to the written word so he gave him the intelligence to print it to distribute it to translate it to read it and come back to the word amen and that should have brought them right to the eagle anointing to give them the prophetic vision to see the story in the story to see the shadows and the types amen and not just get hung up on the correct print and the correct spot the ink blotch is all making sense and then it's more than just the ink blotches getting in the right spot it's more than just having an accurate translation that's important but we come to the eagle age not to get an accurate verbatim translation from the latin into the english that's not what we're after we're not looking for an exact verbatim translation we're looking for the revelation of what that scripture means it's more than a correct translation now we had to come through the stage of correct translation which is the man age that's important but the problem is they stuck right there and now they're arguing over correct translations and arguing over versions of the bible and arguing over critical uh text and all these other stuff textual criticism and all this arguing over and all it was supposed to do is get the word right back in place and then so the prophet could come and give us the proper interpretation of it all so now we come back to the end of this and we've we've been looking for thousands of years and studying and putting the bible together and and it was it was put together and it was lost and and then god brought it back amen through the dark ages and in all all of this we see jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ the redeemer the redeemer the redeemer but we come to the end of time and a prophet comes and says i want to show you more of the mystery there's been more mystery laying there praise god i never know how this is going to go but we're just when when we look down we're going to go in just a minute over to joshua amen and we're going to start in joshua chapter 2 and start looking at the life of rahab but when we get in there this is not something i was going to go into but i just want to share this right here when we get into this you're going to find out that they crossed jordan and in order to cross jordan amen there's some instructions that that that the captain of the lord's army gave unto joshua and joshua carries this out and so now they've got to take the word that the prophet brought god's word that the prophet brought was put into the ark amen and the ark could only be carried by the priest so now the word was brought by a prophet but that word could never move forward there's no moving forward without the priesthood so without the ministry amen and we found out that it's a god called ministry not a man called ministry because when when moses had chosen when god had directed moses to choose aaron and his sons to be the priest and then everybody went into a tissy saying how can you pick your brother we're all we're there's 12 princes 12 tribes why didn't we get a vote why didn't we i mean i feel like i could do just as good a job as aaron could do amen i feel like that i'm just as qualified or i'm part of i'm you know i'm a son also i'm a prince in israel also i feel like i have just as much opportunity and so and so god says every man bring his staff bring his rod amen representing a tribe bring them in and scribe your name on here and lay them in the sanctuary amen and god come in and he says the one that that blooms and brings forth and buds that's the one i've chosen and they bring him out the next day and aaron's rod bloomed amen it budded and it bore fruit amen the rest of them were dead dead dead dead dead but one could bring forth fruit amen in the ministry the true god called ministry can bring forth fruit amen not by their own power they're just a dead stick but the presence of god overshadows the gift amen and there's a certain lineage amen and now it's not a family it doesn't pass from father to son to father to son but by god's own choosing and predestination he has chosen where it's at and now he comes over a dead stick that's incapable of doing anything on its own this is really good for preachers to remember a dead stick amen that had been picked up that had fallen dead somewhere that must have been it may have been an almond tree at one point a limb or a branch off an almond tree that was now a staff or a walking stick for aaron it was dead it could not produce life there's nothing it can do but this one is the one that's ordained amen and then the sanctuary of god in the presence of god he can overshadow a dead stick and not only bud and bloom it can bring forth fruit again so there's no way we're going to get away from a fifo ministry no matter how many people in the ministry mess up no matter how many preachers fail no matter how many people they deceive no matter how many lives are derailed because of preachers we're never going to get away from a five full ministry until we come to the translation of the body it's god's ordained way so now they come to cross into the promised land moses has brought him this far the prophet of god has given them the word of god amen they've got it he's given them instructions they know what to do with it and now joshua amen is coming and he's given instructions now joshua is giving instructions to the levites and they're saying we've got the cross but jordan is overflowing its banks in the time of harvest amen so now you you you ministers you take the ark because you're the ones that carry the ark and we've got to make forward progress amen and mo and joshua tells the people stay back stay back and you watch keep a distance and watch where they're going because you've never been this way before you be careful that you don't get ahead of the word be careful that you don't get ahead of the ministry don't jump out there in front of a levite be careful that you watch and see what happens because this is god's way and we can't change god's way and so they go down and they they they take the ark and they go down in the jordan and they're supposed to go right into the water they're supposed to wade right into the water and they go right into the water and when they do the the water stops flowing down from the mountains in jordan and it pulls back and now everybody crosses on dry land so now as long as the ministry is in the river amen they can pass through as long as they're holding the word in place they can pass through and pass through and pass through until the last one gets across how long are you going to need the ministry until the last one gets across and when the last one gets across joshua says now come up out and when they come up out amen the water flows back over now i told you all this not to tell you that but to tell you something else so pay attention now before the priests come out of the water something happens now remember we're talking about the mystery of christ that was laying in the bible and now we've had years to explore that jesus tells the disciples on the road to the mass and he teaches them in all the scriptures of things concerning himself remember i said we've come to the end now and in the end there's a prophet of god here to go back over the same scriptures and show that there's a bride there too there's a bridegroom we've known there's a bridegroom there we've known he's been there in types i mean we know it types this and types that but he goes back and shows that there's a bride there too and we come down to the to the revelation chapter 10 and we know that there's a seven thunders and we know john was told not to write the things that the seven thunders had said but to seal them up and so we know that there's something else that's sealed up that we saw the opening of the seals in symbol form but when the thunder spoke something was sealed up that wasn't revealed and so you know you have you have two sets of seals brother branham says you have the seals that were broken simple form white horse red horse but then you have the interpretation or the revelation of what those seals was in the seven thunders but john was forbidden to write so they were sealed up and they were not written and brother bam said see like in jeremiah go back and read it in jeremiah because when jeremiah was going to redeem a part of land he paid a price in silver the price of redemption to redeem a part and they took two documents to record the transaction and the deed and everything that went along with redemption of the land amen which is a type of the word and they had one that was sealed in a vessel and one was open you have an open record and a sealed record and when the time came for them to come back out of babylon he does this just before they go into babylon just before they go amen into the dark ages and they fall into the babylonian catholicism and denominationalism but when it's time to return back to the land there's two documents that they have to compare and when they compare these two documents and the two documents line up it proved who's in the redemption what's included in the redemption who has redemption rights who bought it who sealed it who did everything and it's in these two documents now you have an open document that anybody can read at any time but there's a sealed document and this seal can only be broken by somebody qualified to break the seal amen and the seal will signify who's qualified amen and they when there's a qualified person and all parties amen all parties are on the scene that's required to open this document then the document is open because somebody could have misinterpreted the open document somebody could have tampered with the open document but this one that's been sealed amen sealed before the church went in to the church ages sealed before it fell into adultery amen and went into babylonian before that this was sealed and if you pull it out and these two records match now you know who's in the redemption who paid the price who did the ceiling who opens it up now everything is revealed with these two documents one's open one sealed one's there one's a mystery so now this isn't even about hey rahab god bless you we love you you're doing a good job pulling for everybody else amen amen there must be somebody on the internet somewhere spilling coffee on themselves right now amen getting excited praise god so now when you when you pick up this story now let's just go let's just go to joshua chapter 1. see these things that the prophet taught us they've been laying in the bible the whole time see now the prophet's not making stuff up and this is why we have to be so very careful with the message because it's so easy to hear the prophet say something that's different than the way we believe it to be in our minds and we automatically subconsciously without even knowing it or doing an autocorrect to what he's saying and not on purpose not because we're trying to be deceitful not but just because we've always understood it a certain way he says something and automatically we bring a correction to what he says but we're not trying to do wrong there's no attempt to be evil it's just i didn't understand it that way instead of taking exactly what he says we take what we think he says so when we go that's why that's why we said it again i'll say it a thousand times brother bam said above everything else pray for revelation because that revelation all of a sudden you'll read you'll be reading the message and you know you've read this message you know you've read it dozens of times you can see where you've marked it up and then all of a sudden you read it it's like what did he just say i've never read that before i mean i've read it but i've never read it and it's all in the wording sometimes it's all in the wording and it can be hidden in the wording and it can be hidden in a seventh grade grammar it can be hidden there and all of a sudden you know you've been correcting it to proper grammar when god never wanted it proper grammar god never wanted to be correct he didn't want to be modernized he didn't want it to be uh proper grammar he wanted it said just like it was said but because of our education amen we've been correcting the grammar automatically unintentionally and sometimes you're going to go back and just take him for what he said hallelujah so now let's come to joshua chapter four i don't even have notes on this so i don't i don't i'm just gonna have to find it okay they're getting ready to cross over chapter 4 verse 4. then joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe a man and joshua said unto them passover before the ark of the lord your god in the midst of jordan and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord then it passed with it when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel forever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 12 stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spoken to joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up 12 stones watch this and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan in the middle of jordan and the place where the feet of the priest which bear the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day so let's pay close attention to this we're coming across he tells 12 men which are out of the 12 tribes each of you bear up a stone and take the stone across jordan with you and we're going to build a memorial so that when your children's children ask what mean these stones you can tell them about this crossing this day so now there's going to be a public record made and and joshua takes those 12 stones they erect those 12 stones and they become a pillar amen and that pillar becomes a monument for all of israel to know that this is where it crossed this is where we crossed on dry land this is what happened but because there has to be two records why does there have to be two records because of revelation chapter 10 that's why joshua had two records sealed in an open this is the open record so now before the priests come out of jordan joshua goes back in to where the priests are standing on dry ground in the midst in the middle of jordan and he takes there and he builds a pillar of 12 stones in the midst in the middle of jordan and when he's done he tells the priest now to walk out and the waters flow over it and now there's a mystery hidden in the waters [Applause] there's a mystery hidden in jordan in the waters in the word is laying a mystery amen there's the record that's public everybody can see it everybody can look at it and then you can hear that joshua also put 12 more in the river but you don't know what they are because all you heard was that seven thunders uttered their voice and they were told not to write you don't know what it looks like you don't know what orders it's in you don't know which names are where on those 12 stones you don't know because it's hidden in the word you have a public record and you have a mysterious hidden record and jeremiah and the price of redemption had a public record and he had one sealed in an earthen vessel sealed away from sight with a seal put on and nobody could see that one they believed it was there they could look at the earthen vessel you could look at jordan you could believe that seven thunders uttered their voices but what is written in the clay vessel what is stacked in the middle of jordan they've told me what it was it's in the word but it's going to take something supernatural amen to reveal what's there hallelujah now you see the message brother branham came amen it came and it wasn't so much that brother branham came it was that the redeemer came the sealer came because it's got to be the one who's able to break the seal until you have somebody on the scene and all the conditions are met for breaking the seal you cannot break the seal but you've got to come to a time into a place where all parties that must be present are present [Applause] hallelujah and you have to have somebody with the authority to break the seal so you tell me who's got the authority to break the seal on these seven thunders the same one who uttered them the same mighty angel that came down in revelation he's the only one with the authority to break those seals and tell us what those seven thunders are and they found out that brother man thought they would be seven additional seals or seven additional mysteries but he said i found out that was wrong is something that's already got to be hidden under the waters in jordan it's already there it's been there the whole time amen it's never moved it's always been in the word amen but it takes a prophet to tell us what's there it took the one who parted the waters amen he's the only one now that can tell us what's under the water and who parted the water it wasn't joshua it wasn't the levites amen it was god himself and he's the only one that can tell us what's hidden under the waters you can look at jordan you can fish in jordan every once in a while you can bring a lure across it and bump something and you will wonder i wonder if that's one of those 12 stones or not but you don't know you can read the bible you can ponder at it you can wonder i wonder if that's the mystery i wonder if that's it i kind of feel it amen all sudden jordan gets low one year and there's a certain funny little ripple in the water out there in the middle you wanna i wonder if that can be them amen you can't know until the revealer shows up and tells you what's there they can be probed at they can be felt around that but not revealed until this last day so all the way here in joshua you've got this open and sealed mystery you have this open and sealed monument because what are the seven thunders they are the revelation of the sevens contained in the seven seals what's contained in the seven seals the mystery of redemption how he would redeem who would he redeem who falls into what category and redemption it's all laying there amen so what was this monument the monument was the redemption of the people coming into the land who's included the 12 tribes how did they get here right at this spot through jordan through the cross the monument tells the story of redemption and that's what the thunders are telling us the mystery of redemption hallelujah so that was all bonus material praise god so we find out in matthew chapter 1 i'll just read it to you don't have to go back because i made you turn to joshua already and we're coming right back to joshua too but it says that judas begot fair as in zero of tamar and pharaohs begot israel and ezra and begotten aram and abraham began a minidab and a meaning that begot nehe's son and nassen begot solomon now it's interesting that so many things happen between pharah's coming and solomon coming because pharas was there pharaz was one of those that went down with jacob into egypt so pharas goes goes down into egypt when jacob goes when joseph summons for his brothers to come amen he's one of that generation that comes judah comes pharas comes and all of them and then these are all there these generations are all laying there in bondage so it's amazing we have this story of this woman tamar that shows up but you notice they don't show they don't mention another woman until you get to salman who marries rahab and what happens between tamar and rahab they go down into egypt the type of the world they go into bondage this is all typing the church again she goes amen into the church ages she goes into bondage she comes under cruel taskmasters of demons that are forcing her into a forced religion into all kinds of creeds and dogmas and ideas of man and work systems and all of this stuff and they go down in there amen and they're brought out with a mighty hand amen and they wander through the wilderness but now we've got solomon and solomon is coming into the land which means solomon is part of this new generation this new generation not dying in the wilderness not in bondage down in egypt but this new generation is going to take the land so now you have a prince in judah that's part of the generation that's going to see the fulfillment of the promise given to abraham abraham's covenant for this natural land now he's coming into the covenant and when he comes into the covenant he's got to have a wife as he comes into the covenant what kind of wife do you think he's going to get when he's finally coming into the promise given to abraham the same kind of wife that christ gets when he's coming into the promise when he comes back and he restores all that adam's loss he's coming in he is the christ see he is the royal seed he is the benefactor of the promise that's given to abraham and when he comes back in to pay the price of redemption to buy back all that adam lost when he's coming into redemption now as he's coming in to buy the land he's going to have to have a wife amen and he's got to have a certain kind of wife what wife do you think he'll pick he'll pick the harlot in jericho hallelujah amen that makes me feel so good i didn't have to be in a perfect lineage i didn't have to be in the perfect spot i don't have to be third generation message believer to make it i don't have to have a clean life i don't have to always believe the right thing i could have been in idolatry in the catholic church i could have been wrapped up in all kinds of immorality i could have been in every way amen but when solomon comes amen he's coming as the prince of the tribe of judah he's one of the twelve princes he may have been the one that was carrying one of the twelve stones across jordan for all we know but one of the twelve princes of israel he's a prince in the house of judah and out of him is coming the lineage of christ amen and now he's got to have at the time of redemption the time of the fulfillment of the promise the time of crossing jordan amen at this time he's got to have a wife and he cannot take an angel he cannot take a cherub but he's got to go back and he's got to take a gentile woman trapped in the system of denomination and bring her out with a mighty hand so when you see christ and solomon coming into the land when christ is coming into the land he's going to have to have a bride so what kind of bride is he going to have hallelujah oh we're still preaching out of the first six verses of matthew the bible brother branham said it's a love letter you've got to read between the lines the only way you can understand the love letter is to be in the same mind as the one who wrote it you cannot you know i use this analogy before you could be walking through the store and you can find a folded up piece of paper with a heart drawn on the outside and you can pick it up and you can read it amen and all of a sudden you're reading about some sweetheart amen some man writing to his sweetheart and he's writing and he's expressing between the lines little innuendos and little phrases that only the two of them will understand he'll be like remember that day we went to the park oh what a day that was well you're reading in like i don't remember going to the park i have no idea what was what's what's so exciting about this and you can see three exclamation parts at the end so you know there's something amazing about that day in the park but i have no clue what it is he further on and he says you remember what i told you the other day my plan for the future amen everything's working just right on track i got a job and now i'm able to put a down payment on an apartment and very soon what i promise you is going to come to pass and he says remember when i told you what you meant to me and remember when i used and he might use a little pet term that only she understands you can pick up this letter and start reading this letter and you can start giggling because it's silly doesn't make sense and this is funny to you it's a joke or to you it's nonsense or to you it's uncomprehendable but if the one it was intended for ever picked up that note she would be able to read all the things that are not written she would know what the three exclamation points mean she would know what the plan is she would know what having a job in a down payment mean she would know what the pet term represents she would realize everything that he's writing because she's been in contact with the sweetheart amen he's whispered sweet nothing's in her ear amen and she's been the revealer of the secrets to her and she's got the same mind he has and now as she reads the same thing anybody else can read it means nothing to them it's a joke it's silly it's meaningless it's pointless but to her it's a great revelation it's telling her things that only she will know now she's seeing things that only she can understand talking about the past explaining the present and words for the future all in the same notes that's what this is [Applause] tons of people can pick it up they can become code breakers and start breaking down the code of the three exclamation points and breaking down the code of the fragmented sentences and the little pet words and oh he called her he called her booboo well b is the second letter in the alphabet oh and i that's how people read the bible back in the the etymology of this word goes back into the greek and that's how people read the bible but the bible is not to be discerned that way the bible is not to be interpreted the bible is written for the believer and only the believer will understand the bible i heard this term this term was thrown around one time and it absolutely infuriated me and it's okay to be angry i have a lot of good bible verses that says god was angry and if being angry was a sin then god would ascend it's what you do with anger that's whether he said or not amen so being angry but i was infuriated with this term somebody said message people just don't know their bibles very well you mean because i don't have them memorized in order you mean because i i will misquote the bible and quote it the same way brother branham did you mean i don't know the bible because i don't know it the way the baptist scholar knows it because i don't know the greek words and i don't know the structure and i don't know who wrote it i don't know the year that this letter was written you say i don't know the bible because when i repeat stories i tell them the way brother branham told them you're telling me i don't know the bible the only one who can know the bible is the bride of jesus christ she's the only one that can know the bible is the bride of jesus christ so don't tell me message people don't know their bibles they're the only ones who can know their bibles true believers genuine predestinated elect seed of god are the only ones who can know their bibles that's why schools will fail understandings will fail books will fail that's why we don't write a book on the doctrines that brother branham brought i could say i'm going to write a book all right i'm going to write a book on the documents that brother branham brought he already did that it's called the church ages book you don't need to write another one but i'm going to write a book the problem is you're trying to hit a moving target because he's continually unveiling the word to us it's going deeper it's getting richer we're seeing it i don't just see it here but now i see it here and here and here and next year i'll see it here here here here and here i'm seeing it all over the place my eyes are becoming open i'm he's constantly unveiling himself in a greater intimacy and a greater intimacy with his bride so if you try to write a book on the doctors or the teachings of the message it's like trying to hit a moving target you're going to have to put a revision on there every week revision 2572 revision you just you can't get it amen just stay with the message amen stay with the bible and let god unveil it let god reveal it amen praise god at some point we're going to have to get started into this message today i think we should have snow storms and a limited crowd and everybody pulling double amen we should do this every week amen so we find out that judas begets pharaohs of tamar and he does this at the same time the same time joseph gets betrayed by his brothers rejected betrayed denied and sent out rejected sent out is dead so the same time christ is rejected tamar comes on the scene see how perfect this is when christ is rejected by his brothers when he's assumed for dead when he's been sold for nearly 20 pieces of silver he sold for 30 pieces of silver in the new testament now when all this happens now it's time for christ the prince of judah to get tamar and now no women are mentioned for quite a while there's no women mentioned but until you come to solomon and so now as they go down into egypt and they they get down there under hard labor and under taskmasters and all these things now when they come up now when the new generation comes up the prince of the house of judah when he goes into the land now he goes in unmarried amen but through him coming into the land he must reproduce in the lineage again because this is the lineage of jesus christ so he can look around at all the wonderful tribes and all the wonderful church members and everybody that's doing wonderful coming into this land but he cannot have one of them because there's a predestinated woman sitting there and that predestinated woman is a woman with a bad reputation a woman of ill fame the wrong woman in the wrong place at the wrong time is the right woman in the right place at the right time hallelujah many of you that have been been coming to the message amen from outside weren't raised this way but come in you were in the wrong place at the wrong time living the wrong kind of life in the wrong system or in no system at all amen but god found you right there because you were in the right place at the right time amen and you were born in the message you're still in the right place at the right time amen you got to recognize this isn't about rahab this isn't about tamar this is about me i'm looking into the mirror of god's word and this is me and so now solomon coming into the land has to have a wife amen and he has a wife by the name of rahab and salman begot boaz of rahab hallelujah let's go back to joshua chapter 2. in the message brother beam says as i was with moses so i will be with thee from 1960. i want to draw a picture maybe it isn't right but i want to make a point by it we have no history of rahab we know that she was a prostitute let's think she was raised in a home that was a real poor and she became ill-famed so brother bran was starting to dramatize the story he said we have no history of rahab we know she was a prostitute let's think now he's starting to dramatize starting to go into her life and make a drama out of it said let's think she was raised in a home that was real poor and she became ill-famed and she's a beautiful young woman she went into the streets to make her crippled mother and father a living no way for her to work only sell the morals of her body but i can imagine all the time she knew that was wrong this is my worldly journey he's talking about it doing things reprehensible things that are shameful things that i wouldn't tell you about but all the time i knew deep down something was wrong amen it meant going to parties and trying to have fun but something was wrong something was telling me it was wrong this is rahab maybe selling the mortals over her body but i can imagine all the time she knew that was wrong there was something in her told her now that's not right to do that she knew it wasn't what was in her amen that was more than a conscience amen there was something godly in her because she was a predestinated womb she was predestinated to be in the line of christ and her womb was predestinated to receive the right seed to bring forth the right product and yours is the same way you as a little child amen sometimes things would go wrong there was a sensitivity sometimes in you that wasn't in others amen there was a desire somehow you felt a little different or a little on the outside or a little never fitting in what was that that wasn't you that was a life down on the inside of you amen this bible's a mirror now there's two ways you can preach the mirror of god's word you can preach it this way so you can see where you don't measure up and make corrections yeah you can do that or you can look at it to find your proper identification who you really are when brother branham told the story of the little boy who went with his mother into the city never been there before and never seen a mirror before and he goes up the stairs and he he's confronted with another little boy and he raises his hand the boy raises his hand and raises this one and makes a funny face and finally he looks back and says mama that's me that's exactly what's happening as we go through these four women and the first six verses of matthew we're saying that's me oh that's me and that's me and that's me and that's me i can see myself in the mirror of the word it's reflecting back to me who i really am not what i've been identified by in the world not what school teachers told me or parents told me but who i really am she knew it wasn't one day she heard that there was a god that was moving her heart began to tremble why why did her heart tremble than everybody else's in jericho that trembled a different way their heart trembled out of fear of losing what they had her heart was trembling in order to gain something she didn't have they're both their hearts trembled but for two very different reasons in jericho they were trembling because they didn't want to lose their great city they didn't want to lose their great denominational system they didn't want to lose their power and the prestige but this little woman had no power no prestige no great name her heart was trembling because she had everything to gain and nothing to lose she found a messenger she found a messenger from that great move that told her what was going to take place what did you say now joshua had signs joshua had the same sign that moses had exactly rahab didn't ask to see joshua sign she just heard it a type of the church a type of the true church that's been pulled the way of prostitution i'm methodist today baptist tomorrow presbyterian the next day pulled away in prostitution but all of a sudden a little preacher enters the city and said there's a god that lives that lived yesterday and is the same today his power is just the same he does the same works that he did when he was here on earth his agents are on the road now rahab the harlot known as a harlot that's the key known as a harlan hallelujah you are known as part of the world but you're from above you were just known as part of the world rahab the heart known as a harlot she was a type of the believer today the real believer she didn't say now i hear that joshua can do signs because he's a successor of moses i'd like to see some of those signs and if i could see those signs then i'll be then i'll believe it well he didn't absolutely have to show these signs because she believed it anyhow she wasn't a thomas she believed it now moses when he had signs he went down and performed those signs but the sign isn't the thing that took them to the promised land it wasn't the sign was the vindication of the commission and rahab believed it without seeing anything the sign didn't do anything amen the sign was a vindication of the commission it was god backing up his vessel and backing up his vindicated choice but the sign didn't move anything it was the word that moved them the sign didn't bring him out of egypt the word brought him out of egypt the sign didn't the sign never healed anybody it was faith in the word that healed the people and now you have a little woman she's typing the real believer the church of the day amen one with a faith seed inside of her doesn't have to see the same thing that took place in brother branham's ministry before she'll believe she'll believe without seeing i wasn't even born i wasn't alive i have no hope amen i saw a 20th century prophet deep calls to the deep if i hadn't seen that i'd still believe it wasn't the video of the sign that caused me to believe that was just vindicating that's the sign of the messiah that was vindicating the vessel god was backing it up but it was the word that i believed in hallelujah she didn't need to see josh she didn't have to meet joshua she didn't have to leave or joshua to come to her she believed what the messenger said about it let's look at joshua chapter 2 verse 1 now we know a little bit of the history of rehab in joshua the son of nun sent out of shedding two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there come there came men in hither tonight of the children of israel to search out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wish not whence they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went i what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to jordan and to the forwards and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate so now joshua tells these two spies to go spy out that i'm going to jericho and and it's amazing when they come into jericho to spy out the land you have to ask yourself what they're looking for what are they looking for because the bible doesn't tell us that they mapped out the dimensions of the walls it didn't tell us that they looked at the garrison they counted the number of soldiers the only thing the bible tells us is they went into rahab they went to her house it doesn't tell us anything else that happens in jericho except that they found what they were looking for lord said when i return shall i find faith on the earth amen they were to spy out the land they were to look out jericho what were they looking for the bible doesn't tell us anything all it tells us is what they found and what they found was a harlot woman that believed their message it depends on what you're looking for amen because it didn't matter the size of the walls it didn't matter the number of the troops it didn't matter the weapons on top of the walls it didn't matter what kind of devices they had it didn't matter how thick the gates were it didn't matter how many layers of gates it didn't matter the secret passages it didn't matter the secret codes it didn't matter the carriers it didn't matter nothing mattered amen because god was going to bring it down supernaturally without any effort of man they didn't need to know how many people how many troops how many weapons how thick the wall that was unnecessary information but all they needed to know was is there a believer in here hallelujah and they found one and the message the token from 1963 says then rahab said i've heard that i don't want to perish with the unbelievers no sir no judgment had to follow it because they was right in line she knowed it so they made a way for her to escape him they must have beli they must have believed that their own big denomination jericho was able to resist the wrath of god see their own big denomination so brother ram takes jericho and types it with a big denomination amen and now they come into the land and the first obstacle they meet in taking the land taking back the word is this great big giant denomination the mother of all denominations amen and it's got to be taken down but it's only going to be taken down by the word of god my obedience to the word and they had confidence in their big old denominational walls and they had confidence in everything they had built as a system amen but the system was coming crashing down joshua chapter 2 verse 9 and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you how did she know that did she believe abraham's promise she said to the man i know that the lord hath given you the land the king didn't know that the preachers didn't know that nobody else knew that but the little harlot woman knew that there was something in her that could believe said i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the waters of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan saihan and all whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our heart didn't melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath hallelujah this little woman she's stuck in some system of idolatry she's stuck in some big denominational system but in her heart she doesn't believe in the system she doesn't believe in the teaching she believes their message amen she believes what moses told him she believes what god told abraham she's believing the whole word and she's identifying amen the response of the demon powers that are on the other side of jordan they said they are all trembling because of you she started signing when you crossed the red sea and destroyed the the nations across jordan amen the terror fell upon us amen we're all trembling because of you amen all the demon forces in the land that are keeping them off the land are afraid what are they afraid of they're afraid of somebody coming into their god-given position because they know they're there on squatter rights amen they're there because of the fall in the garden but if somebody will come based off the word of god and come according to the instructions of a prophet will begin to move back into their proper god-given position amen everything before them has to fall and now the demon powers are trembling oh if they could only caught this revelation about 40 years earlier because when the spies crossed the land to spy out the land amen they used only their intellect to discern the possibilities of taking this land they made the statement in numbers 13 verse 30 and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once caleb and joshua were the only ones who had faith in the word of god and they all with human eyeballs they all saw the same thing they all saw giants they also walled cities they all saw armaments they saw the same thing but they believed two different things one could only go by what they saw but another one could see into another dimension and could see what the word could produce [Music] caleb stealed the people from moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are more than able to overcome it he is not looking at himself matched up against the inhabitants of the land because they're giants he's only looking at one thing the promise that was given to abraham that's been confirmed through this prophet that's brought us this far that's the only thing he had his eyes on we are more than able to overcome it he wasn't talking about his human ability he wasn't talking about his strength of his arm or the sharpness of his sword he was talking about the promise being fulfilled in him we this day are more than over overcomers we're more than able to overcome every demon power every sickness every obstacle that we face today we're more than able not because of our strength but because of the faith we have in the word that's been restored the promise there's nothing withheld from the children of god not even the change in our bodies has been withheld it's been given to us when the thunders were preached the faith for it has already been delivered amen we just got to have the courage to walk into the [Applause] promise the change in the body amen faith for the change in the body or well the word that we need to change our bodies is not something that's coming in the future it's something that has already been preached and given to the bride that's why when it come to take the land they didn't need a new promise the promise was already given to abraham they didn't need a new promise they needed faith in the promise they already had and so a prophet was sent to the land and that prophet was coming with the pillar of fire to renew their faith in an old promise not to give them a new promise and we've had a prophet come in this day to renew our faith in an old promise not to bring us a new promise but give us the courage under a pillar of fire ministry to walk back in and possess our land the inhabitants are scared to death we were more than able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said i'm still in numbers 13. we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we says who brother branham tells us that the opening of the sixth seal two hundred thousand thousand demons under the sixth trumpet come out of the river euphrates and brother bennett said where do they go and to the armies of hitler and stalin and mussolini we got that so those demon powers have fled out of euphrates that was holding them back and have went in to physical military might and geniuses geniuses look go go look at germany scientific geniuses making weapons of warfare demon anointed armies that could sweep through europe so fast that astonished everybody what was it demon forces brother bam says where did they go after world war ii they went into the ecclesiastical system the demons didn't go back in the euphrates they went now into the church system two hundred thousand thousand how many bride do you think on the earth today a dozen a couple hundred maybe a few thousand i don't know how many demons per bride [Laughter] and brother benham said they all are trained on taking you out 200 000 000 demon forces with one goal in mind to shut down the bride and to take her out i'd be scared to do the calculations to guess how many demons are gunning for each individual member of the bride at one time but guess what we're more than able we are more than a match amen you know what's happening as you hear the word and identify yourself in the word and say that's me and i'm not going to back down i'm not afraid of cancer i'm not afraid of flu i'm not afraid of sicknesses i'm not afraid of any of these forces or powers i'm not afraid of false teaching i'm not afraid of accusations i'm not afraid of anything moving forward you know what's happening two hundred thousand thousand demons have terror trembling in their heart because they're only here to rule in satan's eden amen because of the lack amen of the redeemed taking their position and that's the only reason that they have any free reign at all is because the children of god have not fully realized their potential you know why that's why they want to take the message and move it back into denominationalism and take the message and pull it back into a holding pattern where we're waiting for something we're waiting for something we're waiting for something and someday something's going to happen why because these demon forces are scared to death for you to actually take footsteps of possession on the promises that are in the word but we're not afraid to move forward amen because although moses isn't here joshua is the levites are carrying the ark what ark the word that moses restored the moses that moses brought not a new word not a different word the word that came through the ministry of moses now on the shoulders of the levites is moving into the land and demons are trembling and they will stop at nothing to try to keep you from moving one step forward they will bring discouragement misunderstanding sicknesses financial crisis you name it they'll try anything to stop you from moving forward but there's caleb's in the land today there's a generation that's rose up amen after the wilderness journey that's saying we are more than able to take it [Applause] but there was some right with them caleb believing the word caleb confessing the word caleb ready to march forward there was people right with him that spied out the land beside him that went over and said it is the truth think about how close this is the 12 with caleb and joshua went over into the land and they saw the same things and they said it is true everything moses said is true it surely is a land that floweth milk and honey they brought back great cluster of grapes just to prove that it's true it's the truth but we can't do it we're going to have to wait he says we're not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we you mean a demon is stronger than a redeemed son of god how about 10 demons how about 10 000 demons how about a hundred thousand demons how about a million demons christ in me christ in me i'm more than able to overcome because he that's in me is greater than he that's in the world it doesn't matter how many you stack up how many symptoms you lay down on my sheet at the doctors it's not going to faze me because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world it says then they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel an evil report these were children of israel these were these were on the same level as caleb they were they were his brothers they marched over and witnessed that everything the prophet said is true every the promise is true it's there but they brought an evil report against the land and the evil report is they said something different than what moses said because moses says i'm taking you to possess the land and they said we can't possess the land evil report not a false report not a mistake an evil report an evil report and they said they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof look how many people left the message look how many people tried to go that way look how many people look how they were on fire look how zealous they were look how eager and where are they at now it's a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature you're more impressed by the squatters on the land then you are your brothers because you look around in israel there may not have been anybody with great stature they might have looked pretty pitiful i mean the weapons that they got are stuff that they're picking up along the way piecing things together i mean they don't have uniforms that match they're wearing the same clothes and shoes they came out of egypt and as they were slaves they're wearing slave clothes slave shoes because their clothes never wore out and their shoes never wore out so they're still dressed in slave clothes slave shoes picking up whatever weapons they can find along the way and they look across it trained armies and beauty and glitter amen john marveled when he looked at the false church and you marveled an admiration and wonder because it was beautiful it was perfect all the ducks were in a row everything was in order amen and you look around at the church and the day that john was there meeting in homes and hiding out and a few little people here and a few little people there here they are their greater stature than we we've heard it said some people in the denominations live a better life than you live have we heard that some of them love god more than you do and they're doing more works for him than the bride is there's some over there with greater stature than we hallelujah no sir no works program is outworking the bride the bride's not doing her own work she's not doing works that come up in her mind or make her feel good about herself or make her feel like she's a christian she's only doing what the father shows her amen only doing jesus christ could step over invalids and mothers with sick babies and go to one man who wasn't going to die in his condition had it 38 years and he talked to him and he raised him up and healed him forsaking all the others that were at the pool of bethesda because yeah because he only did what the father showed him you can't outwork the bride if you're doing the works of the father you can't be more sincere than the bride because her sincerity is based on her love of god in the word amen not a love of an idea not a love of a system not a love of a fairy tale not a love of a church or something some brotherhood but it's her love for her husband the revealed word of this hour you cannot love her you can't out sincere her you cannot work her because she's doing the true works with the true love in the right place hallelujah don't look with carnal eyes around that's the problem with these spies they looked with carnality and we're measuring things carnally say they're a greater stature than we please you've never seen me but the prophet said you've never really seen me if you ever really see me you wouldn't say that all you see is me placed in a humble little vessel of dirt and minerals and product taken out of the earth that's all you see but if you ever saw me you wouldn't make a statement like that hallelujah their greater stature and there we saw the giants the sons of enoch which come which come of the giants and we were in our own sight problem we were in our own site as grasshoppers what can we do there's just a few of us what can we do one christian the weakest christian on his or her knees makes demons tremble we don't look carnally we don't look humanly amen we look spiritually we were in our own sights as grasshoppers and so were we in their sight that's where they made a fatal mistake thinking they knew what somebody else was thinking of them they were taking their own image of themselves and projecting it into the eyes of somebody else we were in our own side as grasshoppers and we were also in their sight you don't know that what did rahab said we all tremble because of you and your god we know she's rahab in jericho amen over by the jordan river we know what god did when you cross the red sea news travels fast friends we know here's a harlot woman in jericho over over by the banks of the jordan river and she said we have heard we know about the great thing that god did when you come out of egypt and you come across the red sea on dry land we know that hey and they believed it too and their hearts trembled and terror was upon them if only these spies could have seen the real condition they'd have marched in there with joy if only this bride can see the real condition of the armies of hell the real true condition of all the demon powers and satan himself why is he rage what is he howling about because the mystery is being revealed what's he so angry about why is he so hostile amen why is he so hateful and hostile and working overtime and meant to shut down the bride why because because he's afraid friends he's afraid his insecurity is showing because as he was secure and he was setting satan's eating and he had no threat nothing to worry about he'd leave you alone because what threat or humble little you you're the biggest threat he has that's why he's working overtime to shut you down let's go to joshua 2 let's skip down to verse 23 so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered unto our delivered into our hands all the land for even all of the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us so this new generation that comes up to take the land they catch a revelation that the first ones missed and the revelation is is the demons afraid of me not me afraid of the demons it's the denominations and the false teaching the false understanding that's afraid of me i'm not afraid of them they're they're faint because of us the same ragtag group that made it through the journey for 40 years the same group that picked up armament along the way the same group amen that that has passed through amen living on manna bread from heaven this same group that comes through who thought that didn't measure up to the stature of the inhabitants who thought that they were grasshoppers and they believed the same thing this same group of people now come to another revelation that brings them back to the promise of abraham and they look at them and they receive a revelation from the harlot woman that says they're afraid of you i tell you little bride you have nothing to be afraid of no power formed against you shall prosper [Applause] they are afraid of you the enemy is afraid of you the demon forces the false doctrine is afraid of you you're not afraid because you realize they're afraid two hundred thousand thousand demons trembling amen trembling why not because i'm in a baptist church not because no trembling because i'm seeing myself in the mirror of the word and i'm recognizing that footsteps are my possession and this word is my possession and i can have it all from genesis to revelation and everything in there that i need i can have it today [Applause] hallelujah i love it let's go back up to verse 12 and keep dealing with rahab here now therefore i pray you swear no i'm sorry yeah now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness into my father's house and give me a true token now she's looking for a true token one that's going to withstand in the day of judgment not a little token that makes me feel better not a little shaking not a little crying not a little speaking in tongues but i want a true token that's going to keep through the day of judgment not emotion not a sensation amen and no doubt when she got a true token she had emotion and she had sensation she was thrilled she was excited and then she was probably quite exuberant when she realized the true token amen there's nothing wrong with that but the exuberation is not the token the excitement enthusiasm is not the token she's looking for a true token verse 13 and that we will save alive and that ye will save a life my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all the that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let thee down by a cord then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain let the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned afterward may you go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst led us down by and thou shall bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all their father's household home unto thee and it shall be them whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house unto the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according unto your word so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window hallelujah so now she wants a true token she's heard the message she believes the message now she wants a true token and she receives a true token the scarlet thread and she's told he said when we come into the land bind this in thy window and you'll be saved all that are in your house shall be saved outside of this token their blood is upon their own head that's why the foolish virgin have to give their own blood for purification because they're outside the place of the token he said now in this token this score if it's here if it's here we come into the land all that are here will be safe and they left and she immediately bounded in the window now her token is on display not in the bedroom not in the bathroom not in the kitchen not in your prayer closet but now the scarlet thread amen her token of her redemption and salvation now must be on the window where everybody outside can see it that's why in this hour our token is the literal life of jesus christ and it's not in our prayer closet amen it's not just at home and it's not only a church but it must be bound in the window of our house of our life so everybody can see the token is on display 1960 the message as i was with moses so i'll be with thee brother brown says this great harlot rehab became a believer i took her history here not long ago after she was considered and brought into the faith because of her belief in god she was brought into israel faith a proselyte she courted a general in the army of the israelite army watch what god did for that woman they moved up in the bethlehem and they had a son and this son they called him boaz and out of boaz he married ruth and ruth and boaz came jesse out of jesse david out of david came jesus hallelujah why faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of hearing of god that's god of heaven and earth and believing on him believing what this is what gets really important believing what because she says we all know speaking of all those in that big denomination we all know what god did at the red sea we all know what god did across jordan destroying his army we all know that and we all tremble so it wasn't believing the parting of the red sea it wasn't the believing of destroying of ogg and beijon that's not it's the works you can believe all of the works that's not a problem amen but she believes something different something more not different something more than just the miracles and just the signs and just the wonders she believed something more than what everybody else in jericho believed believing what the commission that god had given to a man named joshua believing that commission amen she believed the joshua commission she believed the commission the man got everybody in jericho believed in the red sea crossing the deliverance out of egypt the killing of pharaoh's armies the destruction of oghan beijing they all believed that but they didn't believe the commission and the difference was believing the revealed word for your day not just the miracles and signs and wonders in the ministry of a prophet they didn't that wasn't it it was believing joshua's commission and what was his commission his commission was go in and possess the land that belongs to you because of a promise that i gave to abraham that was the revealed word for that day and the rest of them believed the miracles but didn't believe that because they believed they had a right to the land and would not accept the commission but here comes a little woman that believes the miracles signs and wonders but also believes the commission that this land is given to your hand god gave it to you because of abraham your abraham seed and she's believing the revealed word for her hour which gave her access to a true token and that true token gave her family access to salvation by believing more than the signs and the miracles by believing more than the story of the prophet by believing more she was now believing the commission the very reason for the exodus the very reason for them to come across jordan she believed the word for her day we gave her access to the token the message perseverance remember she was like the rahab the harlot when the spies went over to spy out the land and rahab saw them that was her first opportunity she had it was her first opportunity she said see she said say bring joshua over here and let me see him let me size him up he's a great big handsome fellow does he have curly hair well you know i might believe him to be the leader of god's band she didn't want to see joshua she didn't want to see any of his or his miracles she said i heard that god's with you and i want to go with you too amen she was persistent i don't care what the rest of my people do how where they're dug in how much they're fortified god's given you this place and i want to go with you believing something different then it's believing something different than great miracles in prayer lines but believing that god has given his mystery truth the revelation of the seventeenth and he's given that land to the bride and the bride now is possessing that land the full word and i believe that and i want to go with you too that's the revealed word for our day friends a lot of people believe in prophetic ministry a lot of people believe amen that there was a great exodus and a great destroying of pharaoh's army and a crossing on dry land a lot of people believe in the destruction of two armies a lot of people believe that but there's more than that there's a bride that's coming in to possess her inheritance amen and it's given to her and it's falling under her feet day by day by revelation by revelation she's taking her position and this rahab said that's the truth and i want to be part of it hallelujah hallelujah brother brother goes on to say i was with moses so i'll be with thee now she didn't have to see a sign that joshua could do with his hand or with a stick she believed believers don't have to see anything they're believers and seeing won't make them believers and not seeing won't make them unbelievers they're believers he said i heard and i believe and now i'm asking for mercy oh how we could put a lesson right there i'm asking for mercy for me and my house look at the roman that night that pulled his sword and was going to kill himself the philippine philippians jailer paul said to you do yourself no harm we're all here what can i do to be saved believe on the lord jesus christ thou on thy house shall be saved why thou and i how certainly thy house shall be saved with thee why if you've got faith enough to have yourself saved you can have faith enough for your family to be saved why because it's all by faith you say well they're out drinking it has nothing to do with their works it's all by faith faith can move mountains faith can move people you have faith enough for your family to be saved yes thou in thy house look at rahab rahab said have mercy upon me spare me i don't want to die with these unbelievers i don't want to die as an animal i want to die in the arms of jehovah i believe you're god because he's the god of heaven and earth he does visible things he makes things real i've never seen him do it but i believe it anyhow she never seen joshua she just heard of joshua she'd never seen god she'd never seen any of the works of god she just heard others had seen it and she believed by hearing it now i said i want favor for me and my father my mother they're both old crippled up i've got some brethren i want to have faith for them and the spies the preacher said yes he's come this way and we're going to take the land now if you want to get them saved get them in the house they can't stay out there and be saved they've got to come in here if you want them to save from the judgments you want them to say from the fiery wrath they've got to come in here hallelujah if you believe it go get them and get them in here for will will not be responsible if they're in the streets but if you'll just get them in the house we'll be responsible hallelujah where that where that little red cord was to hang down the window will be responsible if you put them in the house oh brethren if there ever was a time we ought to get our loved ones in the house it's today the household of faith amen not to the building not in this church building not into your house amen but into the household of faith amen how do you bring them in well i've told them and i've told them quit telling them and start praying with faith believing that god's going to move them in if you believe that they're your heritage and you believe with all your heart they're given to you start saying god move mountains move obstacles bring them into the household of faith because outside of this is destruction outside of the household where the token is on display outside of that there is utter destruction going to take place brother rem says in the token 1964 he says the new testament means new covenant the blood life catch this not the blood the blood life this is so important the blood life the blood life itself is the token what is the true token i want a true token i believe the message i want a true token what's a true token the blood life itself is the token what is the blood life the life that was in the blood in jesus christ that life of god that gave him blood that gave that gave him life when the blood cell was broke that life was able to release and come back on the believer again amen and it's not the chemistry of the blood brother ben said that went down into the ground into the soil in judea amen but it's the blood life amen that life of the blood coming into the believer the blood life itself is the true token hallelujah that's the true token the life out of the blood is the token remember the old testament the actual blood of the lamb had to be applied here it is the token of the blood it is the life from the blood that's in the person for the token the new token is the new life that comes through jesus christ when his blood was shed to sanctify a church and fill it with his presence that he might manifest his word and his promise to the people i want to go back here and i want to look at verse 15 again chapter 2 verse 15. my my my my my praise god we've been so far so far yet to go but let's just read here in verse 15. then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may you go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land that thou shalt bind this line of the scarlet thread this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou dost led us down by and thou shalt bring thy father my mother my brethren and all thy father's house down into thee so i want to read two portions again she let them down by accord through the window down verse 18. when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou just led us down by brother bennett said in the token november 28 1963 notice there was given to her a token a red token that scarlet string that she let the people the spies down out of the window was to be a token here's a great mystery the token she had that she was given was a token she already had the token she was given was a token she already had but the river said that scarlet string that she let the people the spies down out of the window was to be a token god would not god would not destroying it god's destroying angel would not come near her as long as she had the token but what if she said oh let them down oh i let them down done a good deed so now to keep anybody from criticizing me and seeing this scarlet rope hanging out here i'll pull the rope back up then the judgment angel would have never passed over her house she had to have the token displayed and it remained there there was something in rahab's house that she had something she may not have been able to explain something that maybe had laid in the corner for years something maybe she had carried from childhood something that she had in her house that she couldn't explain and it was this rope this cord why do you have a cord i don't know why i have a cord there's a cord in my house i don't know why it's here but there's something that she's had with her and then when the spies come along now amen when it's time to believe the word now to believe the word i'm going to take this chord in my believing the word and doing a service to the word i'm going to put this chord into action and i'm going to throw this cord out the window and let down the spies and the spies will say if you amen tie this scarlet cord this line of the window that that loud let us down by when we come into the land your house will be spared i want you to listen to a couple quotes brother branham brings and how can i overcome it's just like a lily a lily i think is one of the most prettiest flowers that there is i'm very fond of these great calla lilies and pond lily i think there's nothing hardly as pretty as great big pond lily call it water lily how it's radiance now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond now you're going to start finding out where this cord come from and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in and is in it right then when it's in the mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's black it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy in that slime that it's living in yet it's pressing its way through the mud the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time i think that's an overcomer that once in sin once did things that was wrong don't worry about it now hallelujah is the devil trying to make you worry about it don't worry about it now did things that was wrong don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again see god by his predestination sea has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on top of all of that it has overcome it doesn't express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither do you and your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in you didn't express nothing but there was a seed in there and i got it and it got a chance to press into the light and now you're in the presence of jesus christ the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what i mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily you always was a lily but it couldn't nobody could tell you didn't look like nothing amen but until you pushed your way up through slime and muck and black water in stagnant stinky places and you come into the light and begin to express what you always were in the beginning he says and who is this melchizedek and when you become subject to that spirit he's speaking of the holy spirit when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to the spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened hallelujah what is that spirit what is that new birth it's that seed that was always there from before the foundation of the world amen when it comes into the light amen it strikes it and it comes to life amen and what is that spirit is nothing in the word more than the seed word being made manifest quicken to life christ is the mystery of god revealed how do you know because you're a church member christ is living through you so pregnant with the spirit that you're prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that because you're a prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated glory he can't take hold the womb of life is closed anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no word can get no world can get in oh how we'd like to stay on this for about an hour i'm sure you understand christ and his alone already finished the seed was there the seed was all ready when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us into eternal life and as soon as this life-giving flow that seed laying there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold rahab was a harlot other seeds come in just wouldn't take hold seed after seed after seed after seed from all kinds of sources it wouldn't take hold amen this source and that so it wouldn't take hold amen until she come into the line of judah till the prince of the tribe of judah had entered into the promised land she was predestinated to be a womb that would receive only one seed it didn't matter how many kinds had to wash over there was something laying down inside of her amen and that thing that was laying down outside of her would only be receptive to one seed it didn't matter baptist seed catholic seed presbyterian seed holiness seed amen none of that seed was going to bring forth life rahab was a harlot where are her children when she prays she prays for her father's house and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that they have she doesn't ask anything for any of her children because she's a predestinated womb that will only conceive in the line of judah [Applause] amen because there's a bride on the earth no matter what she's believed no matter where she's been no matter how much she's corrupted her mind amen no matter how many seeds washed in they wouldn't take hold because she's predestinated to receive one seed and that's the seed word that comes through the lion of the tribe of judah and when she comes in contact with the lion of the tribe of judah now there's a conception and in that conception what does she bring forth boaz the kinsman redeemer she the harlot amen the harlot of jericho she brings forth the kinsmen redeemer the type of christ laying in the book of ruth that brother branham will go back and show us what's happening in the seals happened here because rahab the harlot when they come into the land come to the kid the prince of judah and together that was the predestinated seed in the predestinated womb to bring forth the redeemer [Applause] do you see yourself adam was given a bride to reproduce himself christ is given a bride to do the same we've been playing a harlot assumed to be a harlot labeled as a harlot with the world but none of the world's seeds could take hold because we had a predestinated wound that was only receptive to the prince of the house of david only recepted to the king to the king of the king tribe and when that came in it produced the kinsmen redeemer hallelujah when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predest before the foundation was redesignate us into eternal life and as soon as the life-giving flow that seed laying there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seed was drove out see like that now now what is rahab is she a harlot now now she's a princess because now she's married to a prince in judah she's went from harlot to princess and one of the mothers in the line of christ i want to read just a couple more quotes and then we'll wrap up brother i'm saying jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if there is nothing in the heart to receive it then there is nothing there how can you get blood from a turnip there is there ain't no blood in it so how can a man believe when there is nothing in there to believe with how could rahab believe unless there was something in there to believe with the voice of the sign 1964 this is always god's way of making his voice known to his people he sends his prophet and gives a sign and then takes his voice that's been spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man and they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day oh if people could only see that if they could only stop just a moment and realize that you see there is no way to make them believe it there is there is no way a man god himself can't do it make the people believe it you've got to believe it and if there's nothing there to believe with how can they believe no matter what you do there was something in rahab that was always in rahab living the life of heartland knowing it was wrong she was stuck into this life there was something always in here and when she would begin to hear the testimonies that were coming through of the red sea crossing and destroyed something in here would begin to stir but then brother bam said the preachers got in one day began to tell her the message of joshua and and she believed it and she recognized this true and she says i want to be part of this i want to live i don't want to die i believe and they go she goes to do a service her faith gets her an action what she believes produces her condy and she takes that cord that's in her house and then she throws it out the window and she lets the spies out the window and she's saying my house my family my salvation and they said the cord that you let us out the window by tie that in the window and when we come what did she ask for a true token what's what came to quicken that seed inside of you and what was that seed that seed was the life of god amen laying dormant or inactive inside of you i say dormant inactive but it can't be dormant and active it's the thing that's moved your whole life you just weren't aware of it it's the life of god it's the very life of god attributes of god down on the inside what's going to quicken it to life the life of god the spirit so when the word comes to the word when life comes to life when seed comes to seed it springs the life and goes into action there is something that rey have always had but she didn't know what it was she didn't know what to do with it she didn't know how to find a true token but that true token was when that life on the inside of her when she would recognize the word for her day she would recognize the commission amen and she would she would she would call out for it amen that thing would spring the life and they they identified that's a true token when the life comes to quicken that life when the spirit of god comes to quicken the life that's laying inside the soul that's the new birth that's the blood life coming into action and that's a true token why is it you could believe and others couldn't how is it that you can list all of your inabilities and you can list all of the reasons why you shouldn't be a seed of god amen some of you can make a pretty good list i can make a really nice list i could list you all the justifications and the reasons why that i should not be a seed of god because i did this and i did that and i did that hey you'd have a hard time beating rahab i bet her list is longer than yours but there was something there all the time doesn't matter how many reasons you can say i was in the wrong place at the wrong time doing the wrong thing so was rahab but little did she know she was in the right place at the right time doing the right things because she had to be carried over into the new testament in place in matthew chapter one in her perfect position in a perfect place for the perfect time to express something that only she can express and now you and i are here and we've all traveled through all kinds of muck and mud and slime and dark waters and stagnant things we've come through all kinds of stuff why because we were the right person in the right place doing the right things to express this great love story in our day i thank god i thank god for his word let's all stand musicians if you'd like to come praise the lord amazing in the day that the spies came into jericho there was a little harlot woman and only one little woman that was given the secret to escape the coming judgment judgment was coming it couldn't be stopped it was ordained it was prophesied it was coming nobody could stop it but there was one little woman of ill fame of a bad reputation one and she was given the mystery secret of salvation for that day to be saved from the impending destruction and the only way that you could be saved in that day from the judgment that was coming to jericho was to believe her and go into that house where the token was that's it you could pray you could offer sacrifices you could run out the gates and throw yourself down before joshua but there was only one way that anybody in jericho was going to be saved from the coming destruction and the only way was to believe this woman and come under the true token that she was displaying hallelujah god has taken us from rubbish from wasted product of life and he's made us a princess in the house of judah he's taken us from nobody from the scum of the earth from obscurity and he's placed inside of us he's placed inside of us a true token and now that true token is displayed in the window as seeds come to life the life of christ on display and now this woman holds the secret to being saved from the destruction that's coming you don't realize instantly this woman became the most important person in jericho in a moment's time she came from being desired for one reason the wrong reason to now she became extremely desirable for the right reason don't sell yourself short don't believe the evil report don't believe that you're small in stature and their stature is greater don't believe that they're stronger that's an evil report amen but those demons that fight you those spirits that come against you every day they're afraid of you they call you all kinds of names because of the way you used to live and the things you've done they label you harlot and they label you this and they label you all of that but none of those labels fit anymore i doubt solomon when he come to his wife after the wedding amen and little boaz is born he's bouncing bowls of his knee he's not saying hey harlot come here and hey harlot come here and i doubt solomon will let anybody else in the camp of israel refer her refer to her as the harlot from jericho because she through marriage has changed her identity and she is no longer the harlot of jericho she's a princess the wife of solomon amen the chief in the house of judah and she's his wife making her tops not bottoms and making her critical to redemption because without her there's no boaz and boaz is the kinsman redeemer you're not just people with jobs who come to church in lima on sunday that is not your identification you're not just this kind of worker in that kind of work and not just a mom or just a dad you're not just a family you're more than that look in the mirror of the word and let the word tell us who we really are through tamar through rahab through all the times it's trying to show us this bride in this day i said god let me live that way brother brandon preached convinced they're concerned are you convinced this message is right are you convinced that you have a true token in your life are you convinced this household of faith is the only place of safety i'm not talking about a building i'm talking about church a group of people i'm talking about the household of faith the house of god then if you are you better get them in now now is the time to exercise your faith now is the time to pray sincerely and earnestly now's the time to ask god give me a revelation for the salvation of my family quicken it to my heart because if you give me a revelation nothing's going to take it away that means they're mine if you quicken it to me not as a hope not as i wish but as a knowing nothing will take it away from me god i want them in bring them in go to talking to them go into praying for them going to creating an atmosphere because you've went from being nobodies to the most important people on the planet today do you know why one nuclear bomb hasn't fallen on america yet is it because she's undeserving no she's more than deserving is it because she hasn't committed any atrocities in the world no she's committed plenty of atrocities why hasn't one nuclear bomb fallen on america because you're here why hasn't the full wrath of the tribulation broken loose because you're here you got to quit getting up in the morning and saying i'm a mailman you're not a mailman you're a son of god who carries man you got to quit getting up in the morning and saying i'm a welder i'm a fabricator i'm a banker you're not any of those things you're sons and daughters of god here to further the plan of redemption here to declare the truth amen of the gospel that's what you are and you may carry mail you may 10 babies you may keep a house you may work at a bank none of that is who you are that's not your identity your identity is not who raised you your identity is not what city you grew up in your identity is not your accent that's not who you are you're sons and daughters of god instrumental in the plan of redemption with a predestinated wound that could only conceive when you came into this word amen and when you come to christ now you've conceived to bring forth the redeemer [Applause] start living life with a true identity not a false one now when the guy next to you at work asks you to pray for him you know you're the source why did he come to you because you've got a connection he doesn't have you've got a relationship nobody else in the workplace has amen start having faith in that and when people want to tap into it let them tap into it let christ be seen hallelujah let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord you're so good to us lord your mercies are new every morning lord we know that these things are an impossibility in human flesh but yet when we look down to the scriptures it was always an impossible way through impossible people unlikely individuals in insurmountable obstacles and that's where you showed yourself that's where you displayed your attributes that's where you showed your great love story and if you did it in tamar and you did it in rahab you can do it in me i'm in no worse of a situation than they were and i'm in no more of an insurmountable circumstance than they were and if you should choose that way to display your great love story then you can choose this body of flesh right here lord and i give myself to you lord that you might take me and have preeminence inside your bride now lord and live your life display your attributes live this story out before all lord we deny our own thinking we deny our own natural identity and we take your name jesus christ to be our identification we love your god and ask your blessing to be upon us give us your love and your grace your strength let your spirit be our guide lord let your life flow through out of us through through us out to others that others might come to this household of faith and find escape from the judgments that are coming we love you lord be with us and guide us keep everyone safe on the roads as they travel thank you for another opportunity to be here lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you let's just sing that song we've been made more than conquerors overcomers in this through the blood of jesus christ
