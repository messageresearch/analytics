lord and we appreciate by the chad giving us the opportunity to come to share the words of life with you thank you musicians amen uh so uh we just like to just go ahead and get into the scriptures and uh see what the lord will do for us this evening i was up in uh toledo working this week and i was just thinking yesterday as i was working at one of the paul's house at his house and uh a little thought come on my mind it sounds a little strange but it just won't leave so i guess i'll preach it uh my title is what the devil has in his mind what the devil has in his mind i was just it just come out of nowhere where i ain't going to say it come out of nowhere i don't believe god just give us stuff out of nowhere but i just uh i said well i just been studying on it and looking at some things that's what we're just ministering by god's grace what the devil has in his mind you know many times we talk about what god has in his mind and uh but sometimes i guess it's gonna do us good to look and see what the devil got in his mind i believe we already know what the devil has in his mind i do believe that so i don't think we'll be ministering nothing new uh that you haven't heard already but we'll just see what the lord will do amen let's go to isaiah chapter 14. isaiah chapter 14. this is a very familiar scripture let's go to verse 12. he said how are they falling from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou i said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit amen you may be seated amen what the devil has in his mind you know um we thank god for his grace and mercy allowing us to be here this evening and we just want to share a few things with you because we surely is in a present time amen it's a lot of negative things you could talk about but you have asked yourself what does good doesn't does talking about negative right it's no faith in it there's no virtue in it there's no help in it amen so we want to talk about the positive things because i believe sometimes if you talk about negative stuff too much it's like giving the devil glory giving him some victory and we don't want to do that i remember um i can't i hope i got the story right i can't remember what war it was my pastor was telling me about it one time how many you ever heard i think this lady i think it's called tokyo rose anybody ever heard of that tokyo rose from understanding when the war was going on i think with the japanese and so forth tokyo tokyo rose was a woman on a radio announcer and on the radio broadcast whenever something goes bad a american die or something like that they just broadcast it on the radio another american down this what doesn't happen this way it don't happen but that was a design to keep for her to keep talking making statements like that so people could hear it to discourage them amen it just kind of reminded me just recently when uh this war was going on while still going on with ukraine you hear all kind of the stuff on the news and and and this and russia is doing this and it's a while it looks pretty bad for ukraine and then i got friends in ukraine and uh you know when you hear what the news saying you say you shake your head before you crane just just and that the other but i called one of my friends he said brother don't listen to that nonsense on y'all uh broadcast he said we're fighting amen he said we we're doing what we got to do i said well praise the lord so sometimes when you can hear certain things you really need to dig in and see what is truth and what is not truth because the things that you listen to it actually influences you can we say man so but we want to hear about positive things it also reminds me i remember uh i went to a museum one time and they had a display in the museum and it's called uh psyops and uh and it was kind of interesting to me and i began to read some of the uh the statements that they had upon there and it was kind of amazing and this is uh it's been many many years ago so i probably can't remember all of it but they had a plane that america has it is designed for psyops which psyops mean psychological it means psychological warfare and in this plane i was reading the listings they had everything in there that they could tap into wherever they whoever they're fighting they could tap into their radio communications and they can they're radio waves and it's just a plane just totally designed for psyops i said that's interesting and then uh so when they can break in somebody else's radio thing and start talking to the people and try to tell them you need to surrender you need to do this and we're going to kill you and then it can mess with people's mind and then they had a display on there where uh this plane would drop leaflets and uh when the soldiers that they was fighting against this plane would drop leaflets down there and tell them we're going to drop this bomb on you and the soldiers that's walking would pick it up and they would read it and then they keep on walking then they'll drop another flyer then after we drop this bomb we're going to drop this one and then they would pick it up and they would read it and then they would literally drop another flyer and said don't try to dig into the ground because the bomb that's going to come out of that is called the bunker buster and they begin to describe how far it could go down in the ground so if you go down in the ground we're going to drop this one on you and then all of a sudden they just start dropping their weapons and they start raising their hand just from leaflets they didn't even have to shoot a weapon they were defeated in their mind so it was over with that's why god sent us a message today to explain to us the greatest battles that is fought is in the mind because once you lose in the mind everything else falls right into place can we say man you see that was the tactic that the philistines used on the children of israel in the saul and saul was afraid soldiers was afraid but if you really look at that story uh god had all of that laid out perfectly because you remember when they wanted the king they wanted somebody to fight for them standing for them so god let a war come to let them show this is the man you choose to fight for you but he's just as scared as you are so god allowed that to happen so he could bring david on the scene can we say praise the lord but you remember goliath he defeated them not throwing the spirit amen not shooting the arrow nothing he defeated them with words he would say amen they lost the battle in their mind and they was totally defeated but when david came the words that goliath was speaking couldn't penetrate david's mind because david had an experience he just pushed it all out so when david looked at goliath he already seen goliath defeated so that's what we ought to do amen by god's grace because he said that we are more than conquerors our enemy been defeated a long time ago at calvary he done it all but we have to believe that can we say praise the lord but you know satan he is a bluffer and he's very good at extremely good at it so we have to understand what satan tactic is so now i'm going to talk about some things and uh just uh but then we'll flip it back around because sometimes i know you can preach sometimes about something on one side too much and you'll be like hmm come on bring it back branch it out so i believe in the balance amen and i remember years ago i used to hear people talk on prophecy brothers preach on prophecy about what's going to happen to america and all these things and they told me everything that was going to happen to the america and you can leave a service depressed you're telling me everything that's gonna happen but then but you gotta you gotta remember you gotta bring it in but the prophet said before one bomb could fall he's gonna take his bride away so that balances it out yeah she got it coming but let me know what's going to happen to me i'm going to get i'm coming up out of here amen so i don't want to be depressed say man that's the same as correcting your children you correct them not to depress them is that right when you correct them then you got to give them a ray of hope yeah you did wrong all right you got to acknowledge you did wrong you shouldn't have done this but then you know after you well sometimes you got to spank them after you do your business then encourage them just tell them you're better than that you know i expect more to you than that i'll listen to it brother i can't remember who you just told me recently he said man sometimes when his parents used to tell him i'm disappointed in you he said that was worse than the weapon say i'm disappointed in you those things cut and they hurt but yet leave encouragement so i believe god had left us with a message of encouragement this message come to encourage us not to depress us so when people around the message i'm not trying to be funny when they're living in a realm of depression something is wrong they need to check their revelation amen they need to check and see what they believe because god did not call us they haven't given us a spirit of fear can we say amen but power and love and the sound mind that's what god gives you so anything opposite of that is what the devil gives can we say praise the lord now what's interesting about this scripture here we're talking about what the devil has in his mind which we know uh we know the words of thoughts expressed before it become word is actually a thought but then when you speak it if it and it come word then it manifests whatever your thoughts was we understand that how the prophet went over this million times god said let there be light and there was light and it come to pass but you remember before earth and all this come to existence it was all in god's mind but now it's just being played out and it being manifested amen so satan had thoughts also in his mind what he wants to do amen satan thought did not start here on earth satan thought started when he was in heaven is that right and that's what we actually just read satan telling what i'm going to do but what's so interesting when when you look at the scripture and you go to the message satan's eden the prophet said god eaten was established in righteousness satan eden is established in sin because satan is sin god is righteous and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and satan establishment is in sin and religious sin i like how he just added it in in sin religious sin he said now notice how he deceived his deception as he said he would then he said he promised to do this then he refers to isaiah so what satan was saying in isaiah i'm going to be like the mohawk satan was making a promise otherwise i promise you this is what i'm gonna do god got promises and the devil got promises but the only difference is god promises this to bless you satan promises to bless himself that's the only difference can we say amen even when you look in the scripture satan say i will be like the most high i will ascend it to heaven i will exalt my throne i will sit upon the mount all of those are satan's eyes but then when you go to the book of ezekiel god got eyes god said i will take away your stony heart i will give you a new spirit god said i will do this i will call you from the nation but the only difference satan eyes is for himself but god eyes is for you god said i'm gonna do this for you i'm gonna take care of you i'm gonna change you but satan said all of my eyes is for me so that's the difference then he says here he said now he said now now what i'm looking at here i listen to ask the prophet ministers and speak he's actually telling us what's in satan's mind he's telling us amen now now how many of you have got facebook oh come on i ain't gonna preach against you you got facebook raise your hand on your facebook when you hit the home button what comes up what's on your mind right yeah just well i promise you after service over you're gonna go before you post something on facebook that's what the title is on the top what's on your mind then you start posting stuff and everything you're posting is what's on your mind right praise the lord so when people put things on facebook they're just telling what's on their mind whether it's good or bad they're telling what's on their mind and it's so sad how bad facebook don't actually got people like to post their problems on facebook i'm going through this y'all pray for me and this and i'm going i'm going through this and then all of a sudden they might go to a meeting one day they don't kind of in a in a good mood then they go to a meeting somebody just walk up to him i'm praying for you they said ain't nothing wrong with me no that post that you put on them i'm praying for you are you okay then you get offended i'm a strong christian not me don't mean no you put it there they're just responding back what was on your mind what you posted that's the only thing they do people put so much of their information on facebook too it's really sad to people know you that don't actually know you praise the lord i guess i better leave facebook along cause there's some people's church and they get offended when you talk about it but let me tell you something friends different things could be used right those things could be used wrong it's just the bottom line of the whole matter but anyway back too much the scripture here now i want you to notice is this also the prophet says in satan's eden he said now he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would ascend above the clouds and the stars and he would sit there like god and be above the most high then he says and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats so what satan had in his heart and his mind when he was in heaven what he promised because the prophet said there he promised what he was going to do but now he has succeeded he said he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats but now he's gonna explain how he did it he said by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of god's promised word to that age so for satan to fulfill his promise he has to attack god's promise and that's what he done notice what he said the value he said he had explained the way in every age the value of god promised were to that age so whatever god promises in the age that's what satan is going to attack to get the people to disbelieve what god has promised in that age can we say man satan they gonna attack you today and tell you and argue with you about noah built the heart what are you want to do that for can we say amen then he ain't interesting that because that doesn't pass so he ain't worrying about that but when satan is going to attack now he's going to try to show you that god is building the bride can we say man how many do you believe god is building the bride god has a bride god is creating his own bride how do god create his own bride by the word that's why when you go to the book of ephesians he said he gonna have a church without spider-rancher he questioned her by the washing of the water of the word but what is the purpose to present her to himself so the bride that god wants he's created her for himself to present her to himself can we say amen but satan want to explain away every promise that god has done in an age he want to try to explain it away from the people that's why he get people to say ain't no such thing god's going to send a gentile prophet that's not really true that god didn't really promise that but god did promise this it depends on where you're looking at so satan won't explain all present day promises that god has given us today he want to explain it away from the people like he said he won't explain the value of it can we say amen see people don't understand the value of the word of god the value why god sent a prophet it's a value in that command kim is that right it's wealth in there it's a pro it's a purpose for that so when we catch those revelations even like uh uh you know me myself you got all kind of different site attacks on the message and all these sort of things it don't bother me people get offended when people say things against the mess and stuff it don't bother me what people say because they can't take it from me there's not a devil out of hell can take this message from burly williams you can't explain it out of me because didn't nobody explain it in me can we say man i've been born again i don't care what i can't explain it don't matter to me i know what i believe so the devil can't shake me from none of those things and people say i just don't believe the message i say well you're an unbeliever then they get mad how can you tell me i'm a believer i said well god promised you to send a message in this day god promised that the bible you said you read and god promised it so if you don't believe that that makes you an unbeliever ain't gonna argue with them there ain't no need because if we're in a time rather of maturing this is maturing time but you got to remember we have to go through things in life to help us to mature now let me just keep reading this he said he succeeded he has success in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threat now let me go on down it says also in god power transformation he said satan's purpose from eden was to make his own self an eden exalt himself above the stars of god god would worship him sons would worship him he said and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this brought it into the church he's which i won't go in details he's any of you listen to these tapes know about it that's exactly the hour we're living in and you remember in god in this evil age he said there's never been another age into this age where satan is called the god of this evil age reason why he's called to god because all the way from genesis he done succeeded to this age that he has actually become god of this evil age so he has fulfilled what was in his mind way back up there in the heavens he has successfully fulfilled it today but we see how the prophet going into details how he did it can we say man he said satan has done it through educational programs now normal preaching ain't nobody gonna say oh come on that's nonsense educational program yeah that's exactly what he has done through school through education amen through seminaries through preachers satan has actually have been able to do these things so the prophet is just really just breaking down what was in satan's mind and how he done these things then he says he said a better fit a better this a better day he said not knowing all the time they are walking straight unto death blinded leading the blind blind leaders of the nations blind leaders of science blind leaders of the church blind leading the blind jesus said let them alone they'll both fall in the ditch he began to break down everything how satan see you and i we just know and isaiah he said how i'm going to exalt myself above god how i'm going to do all these things but god's son is submerging this in time to break it down how he's able to succeed to get his desire fulfilled now you and i we never how many you don't find many places preaching against education like the bride does can we say man but we know there's a balance education is all right as long as it don't get in the way of god because you got some smart people and they don't let their intellect get in their way with god paul was a smart man extremely smart man then the disciples weren't smart man so god could use both smart people and not so smart people as long as they got the holy ghost amen he's their teacher to teach them and guide them what to say what to do so these things are okay now you know satan satan don't brag so much how he had succeeded because one one deceit that the world normal nominal don't look at that the biggest deceit actually today it is through religion see many talk about uh sin on the streets and seeing out hearing prostitution and all this stuff but they don't understand what religious sin is satan is hid behind that so deep that's what people don't catch i was talking to her in the well i was talking to my my niece and i made a statement to her i said you're looking for the devil in the wrong place i said you're always looking out on the streets and stuff you don't know he stands behind pulpits but let me read some something just dropped in my heart but i want to read this first you know satan done black so much he's so thankful of his eating in the world when they have their little gathering and somebody don't make some kind of achievement uh some accomplishment you know they give a toast you know what i'm talking about they say we would like to give a toast to our brother here accomplishment tip hit the glasses together what a great accomplishment when satan brought forth his great accomplishment he said i got to give a toast and he did the prophet says right here christ and mr god revealed he said the bible in revelation said this great city ring over all the kings of the earth said she was a what is that he said a woman that claims to be a lady and commits fornication she had a cup in her hand of toast to the world so that cuff in her hand come and drink of this cup of my great achievement that i have accomplished to deceive you a toast to the world when i read that i said that ain't nothing but the truth filled with the filthiness of the abominations of a fornication and she had daughters the protestant churches to everyone come out of her with her same false doctrines baptism he just began to break all these things down all of these things that was in satan's mind he's actually displaying it through false ministries through false religion all of it is coming out now and we see that right now let me just backtrack a minute because i'm not finished but i want to explain something that just fell in my heart and it's going to be to young people i had something to just recently happen and uh it's just very disturbing when you many take it lightly when the prophet talk about comic books many people take that very very lightly he said comic books is setting children's mind up for a blast that's what he said but you know everybody don't read comic books so the devil what the devil has done in this day they have taken the see now i come from them times i was a cartoonist i lived and breathed comic books i actually used to could draw out of the comic books better than the man that drawed it himself but being an artist this is what i know when you draw something you come under inspiration are you drawing it so i had to get real inspired to draw these gruesome looking pictures and stuff but i called it art and it was beautiful but i had after entering into a room of inspiration to be able to draw that so it's spirits behind it now everybody don't read comic books so what the devil has done i guess in the last couple of years he took what was in comic books and made him live people yeah spider-man movies superman adventures see satan ain't no fool he knows you know people ain't going to read comic books because it ain't no interest in many people but then he thought putting billboards up coming soon thor coming to let it get some people mine can we say amen now to some people it don't affect to some people that do but i'm here to tell you the spirits behind those things are actually real they are real now i know myself i preach a lot about what you watch what you see what you hear affects you i preach on things like that a lot and i know sometimes people get tired of me saying it but i'm not going to get tired of saying it because i know the importance of it amen because people just don't really understand how spirits work sometimes let me explain something friends it's very crucial to know without a shadow of a doubt born again you're full of the holy ghost because i'm going to show you a big deceit that the devil has done and i'm gonna read to you what the prophet said and he's expressing what's in his mind satan is so all of this music and all this garbage they got out here on the internet what you think commercials are for they just pop up out of nowhere and all of them got music behind them what you think that is for to get in your subconscious do you ever think it just is so amazing you can walk into a restaurant and they play the music you used to listen to satan ain't no fool he know exactly what he's doing i have been with brothers before just recently we went to a restaurant the music was playing he started going and then he caught himself yeah oh yeah you remember this science says music is the only thing can enter your subconscious without your permission science says that but look at the deceit satan is expressing everything wanting people to worship him i want to be like the most high he's doing it today let me read this to you i know i changed the service a little bit but that's okay because this just dropped in my heart tell your young people don't play with the wrong stuff if it's questionable leave it alone as soon as the question come up you say i just leave it wrong because who's throwing that question to you that's god wanting you right there just leave it alone walk away don't experiment don't explore just leave it alone this isn't questions and answers they asked a question about uh uh where did the spirits go that was in that man that the maniac or got her in now he said in that man well you know he's talking about how the man hung around tunes making script his clothes off he said them spirits are still here he said now and that man was some of these spirits that was cast out in the swine that got here now he's talking about the man that was uh gonna kill him he referring to him first and he now he's identifying some of them spirits was in that man because you remember he told but the man said he could have kept me just as real easy as he wanted to he's strong he could have killed me but the thing that i love about this so much when he came up to the prophet even god told him not to move then he said he said since you challenged uh challenged god you the one gonna bow down but you as a preacher before that he beat him up can we say man but you remember before this man in the bible before they got to it many tried to bind him many tried to change it but when he met jesus that's when he so now when that spirit that man came to vote around he knew there's a representative of jesus christ who's on the earth can we say amen so it's the same parallel but he says here is some of those poor people out here in these insane institutions beating their heads against paddle bar sales remember devils never die devils always live but there will be a time where devils will have to die they will become totally annihilated but now they are alive he said and they work from generation to generation upon human beings some of them in the form of cancer some is in the form of epilepsy some is in the form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerfulness until they can get into a person they have to operate through a person which brings to another thought he said that the holy spirit covers the earth but it is almost helpless until it gets into you and to me and listen to what he said god is depending on you and i depending on what tabernacles he can get in so he can also display himself depending on us did he say says here the earth he said it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate now here's what i want to get to he said the devil wants to take us over to operate under him so when he gets the mild form he starts in sin he's going to talk about how satan maneuvers to try to do something small in somebody's life and keep them there he says this if he can hold them just in a righteous man he ain't talking about a righteous man if the devil could just put something in their life they could even be a righteous man he said a good man and just let him go ahead try to be a try to be good like that if he could hold him like that until he's dead that's just just what he wants to do he got it because no matter how righteous you are how good you are how moral you are how clean you are how honest you are you'll never get to heaven until you're born again [Music] so the devil can have somebody living righteous clean pure but it could be a sin that stuck there in their life where they couldn't go no further than that they get the baptism of the holy ghost and satan said i can just keep them there until they die they still come to me that's why i make the statement make sure you know you're born again because when god is sealed in the devil is sealed out but temptations still come but you got something inside of you to help you fight those temptations amen people want to say you don't know what i'm going through it's hard you can be born again full of the holy spirit still you go through things still you got trials still you got bowel but you've got something inside of you to take you through them can you say amen go back to the parable when they talk about two houses the rain descended the floods came can you say man and beat upon the house did it then that was built on sand then they talked about the other one built on a rock but they got the same problems rain descended floods came beat on both houses but the only difference one fell one did so christians we go through same problems in similar fashions that the world go through but it's just the only difference we stand they keep falling i don't say they fall they keep falling because we're already falling these things are important praise the lord the devil can just keep you there hold him like that until he's dead that's why so many people are so religious now the devil made them so religious he know they ain't got no holy ghost but he keeps them so religious and they'll say well i don't do this and i don't do that i don't do this i'm okay none of us don't care until you feel with the holy ghost then you're okay until then we're just religious i know that sounds a little blunt but it's time to be blunt because many get discouraged because they see people falling why are they falling because the house wasn't built right when god builds a house it won't fall it might need remodeling and some repairs on it but it won't fall can we say praise the lord amen got them dropped in my heart and share that with your friends satan is up to no good when i say no good no good how many you know what no good is it's no good his whole thinking his whole makeup his whole desire is no good and people are underestimated in john 10 even though it talks about a thief but we know it refers to satan also it says jesus said i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pastor he said but the thief cometh not i just like the way jesus worded it in other words he's telling you the thief cometh not in other words he got nothing that's on his mind but this to steal to kill and destroy in other words he got no other motive and ejected but kill steal and destroy now you say how could you apply that to satan being the thief you know what the the what it says he come to do kill steal destroy all you got to do is compare that to peter when he said the devil going around like a rowing line seeking who he may devour that word devour means destroy so he's still talking about the same person that's the only thing the devil got in his mind kill steal destroy want to steal your joy destroy your life and kill you now i'ma say something friends when it comes to this message when a person been in this don't come in contact with the word of life the trueness of this message and the devil knows that the devil loves it when he can get somebody to fall in this message he loves it more for somebody to fall in the message than out there in the number of the churches he loves it more he said why you say that brother bernie i said it to say this the devil will get more glory for himself in a backslider than just killing somebody oh i know you're thinking out of all of the problems sampson caused those philistines why didn't they just immediately kill him so we got him now to just kill him no they want to kill him they want to make sport mockery to be able to display him where's your power now oh look at you weak you're nothing now that was more glory for the devil than having samson in that situation the same thing today if you can have somebody backslidden and the devil can get people to point and they went to church all those years look at him now i guess god ain't real i guess this message ain't real i guess the holy ghost can't keep you i might always go ahead and live any kind of way too they fail they feel satan like yes yes those are facts that's why i preach on now more than ever you must be born again which you don't become teachings people don't really want to hear no more come on give me some seals brother break some seals down to him all of that comes with it but where's your foundation when you can have all of this knowledge i know many don't have a clear revelation on the deep mysteries of god and then fall i've seen it friends that's why i got to be here first must be born again the devil what's in his mind jesus said when he speaks in luke 8 about the seeds he said those by the wayside are they that hear he said then cometh the devil it taketh away the word out of their hearts i like the way he put it they hear the word he said but then come the devil and take the word out of their hearts because the devil knows if he can get the word out of a person's heart he got him you could have the word in your heart not be born again but on your way can we say man and because you're keeping the word before you're loving the word you're on your way there to get the holy ghost but if the devil started getting you to doubt the word and snatch that out of your heart i got you can we say praise the lord and peter 5 8 be sober be villager because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour to me that's some strong reading it tells you what's in his mind his very purpose he ain't looking for nobody to love satan ain't looking for nobody to love he looking for somebody to devour that's what's in his mind can we say amen then when it comes to job god went right to the point when satan came it says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord satan came also among them it's and the lord said and to say once cometh down god already know where he come from god already knew what his purpose was i'm glad god acts and so satan can reply so you and i know what's in satan's mind then satan answered the lord he said from going to and fro in the earth walking from walking up and down in it but what is his purpose now god's gonna bring god exactly what's in his mind satan just told god oh i'm just minding the business going up and down to in front of her you know just enjoying the scenery that god will go right to what's in his mind listen what god said and god said and say how do i concerted my servant job he went right what was in satan [Music] look how satan put it just you know just just walking around ah god said no i know your naughtiness i know what's in your mind and i'm gonna call it out you considered a joke hello you remind me of some of these slick bars when you're acting what are you doing oh are you doing nothing ah i'm just you know standing over here no you're not you're scoping a lot of times god lets you just peek in their mind uh all you do look in their eyes they're looking for a girl looking at her conscience to see if she's going through something so they can spread their nice little words i call them predators he said brother birdie that is pretty cold nope that's what a predator does a lion might be the strongest they sell the jungle but he's smart too he look for a weak wilder beast you don't want a strong one he'll he'll just watch them get going and then you see a weakling yeah he'll jump on the wheaton and that's what prelaters do god went straight to satan's mind you consider my servant job there is nothing like him in the earth perfect and outright man one that feared god and the sewage evil i wish i could be building that congregation conversation god is telling satan that say i say wait i could just see satan with god telling him that god said hey no lock him in the earth satan yeah right i can change that god just bragging on job and like the prophet said could he do that about you i'll say yes god can't brag on his bride why can't god brag on his bride because the prophecy went forth she will not fall like eve have fallen so god can brag on his bride see she ain't going to fall do whatever you want to do to say she ain't going to fall i just love it satan says here satan answered the lord and said the job feared god for naught this is picture here friends job is minding his business enjoying his wife just just having a good time and he don't even know god and satan talking about it come on you and i don't understand what we going on in the other rooms the conversation still goes on they still go on saturday i can make nothing fall guards no you can't can't do it say you say all right move that head you got how to move it i'll move it go ahead i preached on his years ago and i remember preaching on removing the hedge that wasn't the title but i used that statement because you got to catch the impact of how much courage and faith god had in job he had so much faith in job till he was willing to move his protection from job and prove to the devil job can beat you without me helping you helping him that's why that's why everything's going wrong with pressure now god don't move the hedges from the bride and telling satan she ain't gonna fall she don't need me to help cause i'm in her she got what's inside of her that's gonna whip you say so i'm just gonna stand back i'm just gonna watch [Applause] that's the confidence god has in his bride friends have not made it he said has not thou made an hedge about him see how satan unstudied this brother he already know the boundaries what god done done he do the same thing to you and me he know he knew all about you and about his house and about all that he had on every side satan knew job family satan knew he even knew i can't even touch the children because of job i can't even touch his house because of job that's why it's so important for us parents that make sure we're in favor with god doing what we're supposed to do in our home god will take care of your children god will take care of your house you just stay right with god he does it that's your proof right there even when satan children went out and party i mean children wouldn't party job prayed for he said pray adventure they might sin and the prophet said that's what a good parent should do you never know what your children are going to be getting into involved but you can always pray and keep them before god say god i commit them to you i never seen a time like it is now where marriages is being destroyed never seen a time like this but it's happening because of pressure pressure let me tell you i don't understand why people think their marriage can survive without communication your relationship with god can't survive without communication he wants to fellowship with you he wants to talk to you he wants to communicate with you and if that be so with god that also is in the natural and i'm talking about communication not complaints communication about communicating talking to one another it makes your marriage healthy when you talking to one another a lot of times people don't understand why when i say something it hurts my wife feeling when i say something to hurt my husband feeling it just really tears him up and i said that's good hey what you mean that's good it's not actually good what's bad when there's no feelings then you'll become indifferent when she say something to you whatever you see something her whatever just rolls right off that's bad but when it can hurt at least know that there's feelings still there you see what you said hurt me and if you got physically i didn't mean to what was it now you can communicate about it gotta communicate but chad i'm gonna have to say i'm always close to note because it ain't working let me just give some stories i just give some stories how many you ever read this quote i probably don't preach to here but i say it again this is one of my favorites when that little girl boy left her and she kept screaming johnny i know johnny loves me ain't nobody ever read that quote i know johnny loves me i know johnny loves me you gotta remember what the prophet said he hurt her he broke her heart he said but then she formed herself in that world she made that work she was he was married to another girl but still she said i know johnny loves him i know johnny love she created that world i think present stage of my ministry or ever present from every present ever present water from the rock the prophet said there's enough power in you in me you can go create your own private world and live in it he said but there's if it wasn't a law to it you could do it your powers is in you now i'm here to tell you you also have the power in you to create the wrong world create the wrong world as a pastor i see time after time after time dealing with people i just begin to realize they created a wrong world that they live in it and as far as they are concerned everybody else is wrong because they are not in their world them things will get you keep you and grip you a man can do it a woman can do it you can create those wrong world but i like what he said when he was talking to this girl god showed him a vision he said some transaction happened between her and that boy and when he told her she snapped out of that world and then he said now that you're out of that world look towards calvary so it took a supernatural element of vision to make a snap out of that world and i find that the same thing it takes something to strike a person's heart to pull them out of the world that they don't form themselves in it because when you get yourself in worlds you actually become right in your own world and it's right to you [Music] back in april my wife it was her birthday but in february my daughter called me she said daddy we gonna give mama surprise birthday party she said you play a major role in it that's okay she said we're going to do at the fellowship hall at the church and you got to get her there without knowing it's a party i said okay so i can do that that was in february then here comes april get close to her birthday but no see what i did as soon as my daughter told me that i think it was the next day i called my wife i said you know i said this year for your birthday i said i don't need you to make no plans she said why that's because i

my wife she was there all weekend but then we got close to her birthday nobody was saying nothing her children wasn't saying nothing see one thing about mamas when the children playing say something make them happy the daddy might get a little grace but when the children don't say nothing they can get pretty rough sometimes so i said niece l okay because this is going to be on a saturday i said uh i got us a room up here at this uh motel here and i said we're gonna go there and i said make sure you drink your dress and we'll go from the restaurant or something first what we're gonna do first that's first thing we gonna do go to a restaurant he said oh yeah and i'm saying to myself i said now lord you're gonna have to give me some grace i said now lord the only scripture i can think of as a rehab said she didn't know what them spies were but she knew exactly what it was so you're going to give me some great blow outside repent out of all this one it's a surprise she said okay so we was in the motel so friday she started moping around sad looking in her little planner i said what's wrong with you nothing let me tell you something friends about marriage life we tell lies sometimes oh brother burly yep when you know something is wrong with you your husband or wife say you okay i'm fine and you know you're not fine now it's okay if you're going through something but your faith don't come to a level you see your way out now that's okay but you're just miserable you can be you can't you tore up inside did you say i'm fine come on listen you sure you're fine yes okay are you sure

said listen she said i'm okay no you're not let's listen i said now if i knew you was gonna be doom and gloom in this room here cause we could have stayed at home you could have done it at home you got to make it look good because it's a surprise she said oh bernie okay she said she said well my children ain't saying nothing to me burly or nothing she said but at least tomorrow you have plans she said so i'm looking at that what she did she done created a world and stuck in it i'm talking about that depression was in the room just strong i could just feel it i just went to sleep because it wasn't gonna be nothing i can do to change it so saturday came got up that's all right gotta be that two o'clock she said okay okay then i see her putting her dress on smiling trying to make herself happy but she was hurt because the children didn't even call and say happy birthday she was doing the best she can i just like the lord have mercy i said i'll be right back she's okay i went to walmart you know these little rags most of the black people wear them on their head they call them do-rags i only bought a couple of those i came to the motel i laid them on the bed started opening them up what are you doing because you know i'm bald headed you don't wear those i said oh this is not for me it's for you she said for me i see y'all from the blindfold you get it to the bread i promise wherever you take me i won't look to forget that's oh no no no no no i got those things man i wrapped them around the head it's about a 20 minute drive to the church i wrapped them around the head you know we sat in the car i wrapped them around there can you see you know see my wife smart so when i started leaving out of the motel i knew what she was going to do she was going to calculate every turn and try to map out where we're going so i just circled around the motel that throws everything off i just circled around then we got the driver and she said how long it's going to be forget that i said it ain't that long it ain't that long and it was a lot of tension because everything kate was not doing right this didn't do what they potentially start going and then my daughter said dad you got to come a little come a little late she said mama remember beside you knowing my phone run i had kind of blanked out a little minute she was sitting there i said hello she said daddy you got to come like i said what nick i said she did what happened what happened i said she just wants some money see the man besides him you just come a little later i said all right so we went on another scenic route i just circled around the berlin where in the world we had then i got close to the church when i was getting close to the church i see my son pass go in the little direction what are you coming with attention then i pulled up to the church and then we got gravel in our parking lot she said see the bird i hear gravel that sounds like gravel i said yeah what restaurant got ground i said nishi i said we're going to get on some pavement it's just it's a lot of cars out here that was true there was a lot of car she said all right the people walking by knew that she just sitting there and then uh all right you know i had pulled back to the back with the fellowship hall i said you ready they restocked the door i can't so you stay right there i'm coming open the door open the door when she put her foot out she said this grass what kind of restaurant got crashed i said nation just hold on my hand just hold my hand i'ma i'm gonna walk you through it this is so it's okay it's okay then we got in the fellowship hall people all around then we got in she was just doing like this and when i took that regard surprise she was shocked and she just said all of these beautiful people people was everywhere she just started walking like a zombie we they had a table for us she was just doing right there they always sat down she said burn i feel so bad i said you ought to i said look at this world you created now look we done this for you i said but you let your mind go so many places doom and gloom because it's a world you created we do the same thing sister never let the devil come to you and say your husband don't appreciate you children don't appreciate you they don't appreciate what i do around this house don't let the devil do that to you because i'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen you're gonna start walking around your house i call it zombie mode and not saying it to be funny you will be in your house functioning without an anointing you just go through motions cook he likes this thing they like because you're in your own world nobody appreciates me now because when you feel appreciated you just cook then you excited because you you feel appreciated but when you get in that wrong world everything come down same as a man when you don't feel appreciated look at the children look at that they always want something buy me this and buy me that but they don't see where it comes from what i have to go through to get it and stuff man you creating the world and when you create the world it caused you to respond wrong you start being negative and bitter because it's your world you create it and you think everybody got to come in it ain't right that's not right we ought to live in a world of faith believe in the promises of god knowing who we are that we are the bride of jesus christ that's where we ought to be living not in the doom of gloom see it's all kind of worlds i can name all different ones i know it's getting a little late there's a different world we create and they'd be wrong a lot of people create worlds just by looking at services on the internet then they create a world against their own church why our church don't do that look what they do in their church we don't do that then they come in their church own little world only thing in church is their body not the spirit children do that stuff boys do that girls do that create worlds and they be the wrong ones everybody she got a girlfriend she don't got well she got a boyfriend well that's around the message too don't know who thought that that homosexual spirit won't come around message believers i don't know who thought it won't but that's the main place to try to come because we got to remember it was so bad they wanted angels as close as you gonna get around angels around the blood of jesus christ they wanted them that's how bad it's getting and people don't realize this stuff talk to your children talk to your daughters talk to your sons if you gotta talk about cushion they might get tired of hearing them but still keep planting them seeds and let them know the program of god your son your daughter god you can you can live a half to have a happy life happy healthy marriage you can have it just just put god before everything put it in and sometimes you might seem like it ain't doing it i promise you the scripture said train them the way they should go praise the lord worlds i'm a pastor i've been guilty of creating my own world oh yeah i've done it so i'm not just putting fingers i can preach from experience church don't really appreciate me i don't know well they don't want me i just leave i can leave i got no problem leaving except creating the world creating it but then all of a sudden you say but oh that service right on the money thank you dude come out of that world i appreciate that so you create these worlds man is that correct that's why it's good to appreciate one another tell one another i appreciate you i was just reading the text my wife had sent me she said brother i thank god for you being my husband and my pastor that made me feel pretty good you're my husband you're my pastor but these worlds we create friends they are real may god bless you my everything changed but this is what's in my heart praise the lord if you got problems i like to tell the young people if you're struggling you got problems don't keep it to yourself talk to your parents be honest with your parents even if it hurt them just just say mama i i need to talk let it out don't try to handle it by yourself let it out praise the lord my son he tell me some things what he used to do when he was a child i just shake i couldn't believe you done stuff like that he didn't laugh about it wasn't bad stuff daddy he just some of this stuff in his imagination he's a daddy he's a man he said i know i got in trouble one day he said you came home that particular day he said he was eating your dinner see my son my youngest one i always knew when he was in trouble he won't eat and that boy loves to eat whenever he won't come to the dinner table and eat i know he don't got in trouble in school it never failed he just loses his appetite is it dead it's when i seen you eating your food when you put that spoon to your mouth he said you're seeing your muscles on your arm he's like oh this man gonna kill me that's the boy you crazy he's a but daddy he's the one that you just can ready to get me up with him and then one of your friends popped up and said hey you want to go fishing he said then you say yeah let's go he said then you looked at me and said i'm gonna get you when i come back he said that i went in my room and i prayed to god you will forget just pray he i guess god answered his prayer so god got ways to make children pray so god answered his prayer i think i forgot but he could tell me those things but i had to ask myself what did i project to make him feel that way though that i'm some kind of brute father what did i do so i don't want to project nothing like that i want to know yes from your father but when i have to correct you i will because that's my job that's my duty and the correction is not to kill you it's to help you because that's the parent's duty children be like ah yeah no the bible said let them jump it won't kill them they scream they care but it won't kill children and nothing but this day is a bunch of psychologists they can play with your emotions huh they can say some stuff that throw you off track they can do it i just never forget even my son one day he just messed up my son imma have to i'm not disciplined i have to discipline he really did something bad he pleaded so bad daddy no daddy dad please he starts saying mercy mercy he said that mercy with so much compassion till it start bothering my mind the scripture comes in my mind he that show no mercy receive no mercy that's not passion that he will it really messed me up but i had to push all that reason aside as a son you stepped over grace you stepped over grace i have to be a disciplined parent i have to i have to do it can we get the law of the hand i'm going to stop for the chad more coming up so i better stop may the lord bless you it's a little late but i got a lot in my heart but trust me god changed the service and i just prayed something was said to help you because that's my i'm telling you pastor that's my only interest if i can't help nobody i won't i won't do i'd rather not do nothing i can't help say something to help that's my whole motive energetic all it has been to try to help people see them watch them grow in the lord that's what have been my motive in the jedi since i've been in this message yeah you get misinterpreted sometimes that your legalists are hard i'm over all that kind of stuff because i know what's in my heart this is what i know you can't play with spirits don't play with the devil let's just borrow hearts musicians should come maybe we could uh pl you play that song draw me near you know that song brother drop me near i think that's a wonderful song for us that we want to be drawn nearer to him i know i do and he's the one that does the drawing he pulls on us and i'm so thankful that he does if i'm asked a question how do you know god loves you i said man the way he beats me the way he corrects me i know he loves me he's a true father let's pray father we so thank you for your word [Music] things just changed lord but that's okay i think about what the prophet said that any minister knows when you want to change the direction they know to leave the notes alone and that's what we did lord because some things i just really felt need to be said and i know it's not going to return void it'll go exactly to where your purpose is to go the father i just poured out my heart this evening trying to show even what's in satan's mind is up to no good it's deceiving to get people to feel religious but not born again sanctified but not filled with the holy spirit satan is such a deceptive deceiver in these things but i'm so thankful oh god for predestination that everything is into your hands oh god it's not me choosing you you chose me and i'm also thankful for the scripture that whenever you start a good work lord you're also gonna finish it and we're going to be just like paul we're fully persuaded that we commit to you lord that you'll carry it through so father we thank you this evening and i pray that you just really dealt with the heart of a young person to let them just be careful of the things that's surrounding them because we got choices nobody can force us to do nothing we also can say no we have choices and maybe we just recognize hey i'm a son of god i might be in this blood to see an age but i'm not a layer of sin i am a son and daughter of the lord jesus christ so father i just commit everything to you and into your hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen may the lord bless you oh chad god bless you my friend thank you god i am [Music] i have heard that voice and it told thy love to me but i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee drawing nearer near blessed lord to the cross where [Music] [Music] [Music] me now to die service [Music] let my soul [Music] up with us dead fast hope and my will be lost in the draw me nearer mirror blessed lord to the cross [Music] leading sounds [Music] amen god bless you you know what we saw tonight was god take a man in his hand and turn him from where he thought he was going to go to where god needed him to go amen pay close attention to those things don't let that don't let the uniqueness of what god did here tonight be wasted grab the portion that god spoke to you and hold on to it god was trying to get our attention and and you know i know more than most people know and i know how needful that was and i can't even tell you why but i knew what god was doing and i know it was needful and i know that we need to pay attention that we don't allow our circumstances and our own mind to create our own perception of reality but we need the word to constantly wash that away and give us reality what is reality this message is reality the word of god is reality what god says about us is reality not what we're thinking other people are thinking about us that's not reality the reality is what god thinks of us amen and we need to stay true in the real realm the only reality is god's reality everything else is false amen when we find ourselves getting caught up into these things we need to come back to the word and say god wash my mind away i'm getting discouraged i'm getting angry i'm getting upset because of what i'm thinking about amen but god wash all that away and let me think on your word that will bring me joy bring me peace and erase all of these things the devil's playing with in my mind so i know beyond the shadow of a doubt what brother burley went into when god took him and turned him was important very important and i trust god will let the message hit home until we'll come back to the real reality and also what did the warning he gave to the young people let me tell you you're going to get out into the world as you go to college and school and into the workforce you're going to face more and more things and more and more opportunities to come in contact with stuff and i'll tell you don't play with any of it don't play with any of this world is so enticing it's so entertaining and they've learned how to capture amen the minds of human beings with with little snippets of entertainment and funny things and little video clips and all that stay away from all of that stuff it's trying to suck you into more deeper and further and it'll play with your mind but now's the time to consecrate yourself and separate from those things and say i want my mind preserved for the word of god i don't want my mind full of little funny clips and snippets and this that and the other thing but i want my mind focused and full of the word of god if you do that from the time you're young you won't be standing like me and like these others who wish that we could erase things that we saw wish we could erase things that we heard and we constantly have flashbacks from old things that we saw and things we experienced but you have an opportunity to not have to deal with that i say preserve your mind for god this is a special generation this is a special age this is the end of the end and you've been called to manifest at this time amen preserve your mind for the word of god because you're going to see the greatest thing that god has ever done is he doing now and the devil will try to get you off course and play with your mind amen tonight was unique it was needful i'm brother i'm so thankful brother burley was here and as a gift in such a way that he can be so sensitive when god turns him he can move and he can follow regardless of what anybody else thinks because i as a pastor know it was needful amen take it home take it personal amen don't waste what god did here tonight amen how many will be praying for brother burley and
