========================================

we are standing on holy ground and i know that there are angels or [Music] jesus [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth [Music] to be like all through life's journey [Music] [Music] as brother chad comes this evening praise you [Music] [Music] praise you [Music] praise you [Music] let my love oh lord [Music] praise [Music] oh let my love [Music] breathe [Music] um [Music] praise [Music] let my love [Music] [Music] oh praise god amen how many are happy to be here tonight man it's good to see you let's take our bibles while we're standing go to hebrews chapter 11. i'm going to continue on with some things that we've been talking about but i'm going to back up and kind of hit a foundational element here the lord has just been leading me this direction all day for a couple days now so we're going to look at building on a strong foundation and we're going to talk about this and we're going to begin here in hebrews chapter 11 the foundation of faith hebrews chapter 11 and i want to go to verse 1. let me get caught up here hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's bow our heads lord jesus we ask that you would bless us now lord that you would minister unto us god that you would break the bread of life to us your waiting children lord as we've come tonight let it not be a routine or a tradition but lord let our hearts come full lord wanting to hear from you and may you meet us in a special way tonight and speak to individuals who have needs lord and only you know the needs and only you know how to take the word and place it right on top of that need lord and we ask that you would do it lord for you're the great physician we pray god that you would anoint these lips to speak your word and anoint our ears to hear in our hearts to perceive all that you have for us in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen and i hope i don't disappoint you i don't have a great message on prepared on political things and the inauguration and because this is kind of old news now you know we've known what's been happening and we know that there was inauguration an inauguration of a new president and vice president and for the first time we have a female vice president united states and um you know we've had three wednesdays in a row that's been interesting you know we've had two wednesdays back we had a great uh riot in the capital and then the win the the last wednesday we had an impeachment of the president for the second time and then we've had an inauguration of a new president and the first female vice president united states and i say we've had three big wednesdays and but you know you know i spoke about this before when it looked like the election was going to go to um uh joe biden and kamala harris and i laid down the quotes and i spoke about that before and i feel the same way that i did then that brother branham told us the fulfillment of that prophecy was the catholic church it was the catholic church coming into america he said she's already on the throne but i do believe that god has natural types of spiritual fulfillment and god is very well allowing and it has been for the last decade or so that women have been rising to power in america as a symbol of where that catholic church is so now is not the time to be a believer in the prophecy it was decades ago we should have been a believer in the prophecy is that right now is not the time to be a great message believer we've known this amen and now now's not the time to get on board it was the catholic church brother brethren said it was the catholic church right the deception kamala harris is not the deception are you deceived by that nobody's going to be deceived that not even a nominal christian is going to be deceived by that but it's that system that's behind it it's that system that's working it's that catholic system that's taking over control of the world and if anything god is showing it on the outside what's going on behind closed doors so because of that because we've known where we stand on this and because of what brother branham told us i don't have a message on politics i just have a simple message on faith amen because we are the seed of abraham children of faith faith seed of abraham and that gets us everywhere we go if you know i mean there's going to be i just warned you there's going to be buzz buzz buzz buzz all over the place about this and you your phone may already be lit up and you may be getting pictures in this and that and that i'd say hey this is old news we know what this is amen god is god's prophecy is still marching on amen the plan of god is still moving forward and i still want to want to know what he wants me to do today and i still want to know how he wants me to act in this situation how he wants me to live in this environment in this world and how that christ wants to be known in the formation of his bride and so now is the time for us to rise and shine like always amen and we we go to this scripture entitled this building on a strong foundation the lord's been drawing my attention back and i just assume that there's a need somewhere in the assembly because he won't let me get off into other things and i want to be preaching you know i told somebody i want to preach on the capstone but i'm preaching on the foundation amen and and this is for us we have need of these things but if we look here at verse 6 hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith it is impossible to please him and that statement i want to hone in on right now without faith it's impossible to please him because i want to put the devil to flight right now because how many times have we exhausted ourselves trying to please him by our own works and our own efforts and our own thoughts and our own this and our own that trying to find favor with god through a works program that we worked up ourselves or a good behavior program or some way to get in good with god to please god amen an old denominational way of thinking an old leftover carryover idea from the denominations that i must be a good boy and i must do right to please the lord but the scripture is clear that the only way to please him is by faith and my faith is what pleases him amen so brother brendon even told us that that you know works is faith expressed the works does not bring faith works is an expression of faith and brother brahm says yeah brother of them said that god sees our faith man sees our works man can see our faith by by the outcropping or the working of our faith but god god sees the works but god sees the faith behind the words and it's not the works that please him although we have a desire to do whatever he wants and obey his commandments and walk in his word amen but it's the faith that pleases god and so this is the foundation that we want to focus on is faith if we turn to ephesians chapter 2 i keep your bibles handy because i want to go to a lot of scriptures and maybe we'll just slow down and do this as a bible study maybe ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 very very very familiar scripture but i want to lay it in right here for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast now focus on eight now we are for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen so without faith it's impossible to please god and i'm not say i'm saved by grace through faith and that not of myself it's a gift of god so i have a gift of god to believe in god and the only way to please god is to believe in god but i have a gift of faith that didn't come from myself it came from god so i have the mechanism already inside to please him not the external works or the or the the conjectures of my mind or the labors of my arm amen but there's something that he placed inside of me a gift that came from him and that gift expressed is the only way that i can please him so you see god god has not and like i said i want to establish a foundation amen it might be for the youth it might be for an old timer it might be for a newcomer but i want to establish this on this unmovable foundation because god is not basing his salvation on the fickleness of mankind or your ability to do something right or think right or or you're the hope that god will extend himself amen brother bam talks about this all the time and it's not god hoping that you know if i come down and save the world and make a sacrifice there might be somebody that would believe it amen but he already knew who would believe it before amen this plan was finished in his mind i mean we were already there so god has not based it on your fickleness but so many times we get discouraged and we get down amen and we we start to in our own minds question our sonship and we're basing it upon the flesh man and by basing it upon the flesh man amen we already know who our greatest enemy is it's the guy you look at in the mirror every morning that's your enemy that's the one that that is born in corruption and coming into the world the wrong way it's born and sin come into the world speaking lies and must have its atoms changed must be glorified and so but we base too much of our faith on that what that guy is doing i understand what i'm saying and then we begin to waver and we begin to meander and we begin to question our sonship and whether or not we're saved or whether or not we've had an experience with god and we'll go and we'll put a stake down and we'll walk back and pull the stake back out acting as though god is depending on us for our salvation but god didn't base it upon us he based it upon himself and it's going to be it's going to be received by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it's a gift of god and that faith is the only way to please him and so we need them we need to focus on the thing that matters most is what is this that god has put in me that believes him regardless of what happens whether i like myself today or hate myself i still believe god whether i've done good or i've done bad i still believe god whether things are going right or going wrong i still believe god no matter what happens there's something in me that that that believes this word that believes this truth that can't walk away that that can't deny the truth of the word what is that and where did that come from and we need to get back on a solid firm foundation brother bam says in adoption he's preaching adoption this is part three he says by faith are you saved that's your faith in god the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you clean how do you say saved by faith are you saved in that by god's foreknowledge calling you you are saved and the blood makes an atonement constantly keeping you clean god made a provision for your salvation based on his will he willed it and he determined it before the foundation of the world amen and god had already wrote your name in the book and he was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world that would pay the price of redemption but also be the atonement to keep you clean amen because god knew that although his although salvation was determined by god's foreknowledge that in this flesh you would need something to keep you clean so he in his foreknowledge provided amen a sacrifice for the atonement amen he provided a mechanism whereby you could be saved by faith he was going to ensure that the faith was going to be locked into the seat and he could unlock it by the light of the hour amen so he had programmed everything to work but in this life coming a wrong way through a fallen condition you are also going to need a blood sacrifice to keep you clean as you walk through this earth so that being said brother branham making the statement this way it's as if god knew that you would you would come to the realization of salvation you would come and be awakened to who you actually are but after that awakening there would still be stumblings and failures and fallings and backslides that would require blood to keep you clean on the journey so when we when we come to a place where we have need of that cleansing blood to keep us clean why do we go back when god has already provided this for us because he knew beforehand that we would need this blood to keep us clean because he knew what kind of journey we would be in why when we come to a place where we need that blood to keep us clean we go back to doubting whether we're a child of god or not see the statue of a perfect man is built on the foundation of faith faith is the foundation and and i wonder sometimes in our own minds if we've tried to climb in the statue of a perfect man before we established our foundation and made sure we knew who we were don't try don't try to climb don't try to come to anything until we can come to the realization that by the grace of god i am what i am and then build from there let's look at this in second peter ii peter chapter 1. this is where brother branham gets his scripture that he uses for the stature of a perfect man ii peter chapter 1. verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge so when it comes to the divine nature he begins with faith because everything for us starts with faith and the message of the statue of a perfect man brother bam says notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here he's drawing the pyramid i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be in when you're a skeptic of the bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you you just might as well stay back until first you believe it what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise but first it's got to be faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is faith is the substance of things hoped for it's your you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for hebrews 11 see the evidence what is it what kind of evidence a holy evidence so what kind of evidence is faith a holy evidence what kind of evidence do you have that you're a child of god a holy evidence why because i believe you know it sounds so it sounds so trivial but there's a difference between intellectual faith and real faith the real genuine faith of the heart is not an intellectual faith it's not trained it's not taught it's not schooled amen but it's something that comes from deeper on the inside it's not the mind but deep inside there's something that says by the grace of god i am who i am amen i know that i come from god and i go to god amen i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be let's go to romans 4. i'm just laying these scriptures in and i want to lay them in tight romans chapter 4. we read this just a couple weeks ago and i'm going to read it again romans 4 chapter 1. what shall we say then that abraham our father has pertained the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of dead now this scripture these scriptures are so familiar they're so familiar to us we've taught on them so many times that i don't want to blow by them because these things are going to become intricately important later because when jesus shows up on the scene and he begins when he has his ministry there two thousand years ago amen he is he's walking around and he's seeking he's come to seek and to save that which was lost so he's looking for something that belongs to him that's lost amen he's not trying to take something that's not his and make it his he's looking for his own and while he's looking for his own amen there's a mechanism by which he's going to be able to draw his amen and he's going to draw his by the revealed word for the hour by the manifestation of the word will draw the elect sheep amen but it wasn't who it looked like it should be because it was not the pharisees and the sadducees and the religious leaders of the day there were some who believed but the majority didn't believe amen but it was the harlot and the prostitute and the tax collector and the fishermen and all these ones that had no ability to live the kind of life that a pharisee was living so jesus was going to come on the scene and and as he's going to come on the scene he was going to totally disrupt normal thinking and we'll watch we're going to watch that as we move on but he's going to totally disrupt normal thinking but he's going to take us back to the fundamental faith of abraham because here you have a nation of people that consider themselves children of abraham seed of abraham amen keeping the promise of abraham and heirs to the promise of abraham and we find out that it was actually very few of those millions that were there that they were actual seed of abraham they thought they were genetically they thought they were by a natural heritage amen but they were not the faith seed of abraham so now you see so he goes back to abraham's justification to show that it was it predated the law abraham's justification abraham's choosing and his justification was before the law it was before circumcision and he's going to go back to these scriptures and show us that what was it that justified abraham amen it was abraham the fact that abraham believed god that was his justification and now they had gotten to a whole system and a whole organization and a whole set of rules and conducts and orders and beliefs that they had to have for justification so that so that the harlot couldn't attain to it and the woman caught in adultery couldn't have came to it and zacchaeus couldn't attain to it but when when jesus brought it back down to those who who be those who believe god who are of god or are my sheep he hear my voice he brought it right back to where abraham was he bypassed all the things that man had made it all the traditional understanding all the church and religion and jesus took it right back to the same thing that abraham had now the harlot could have and the woman caught in adultery could have zacchaeus could have and a fisherman could have and a tax collector could have and if that's the case you can have it and i can have it amen and anybody that's out there living in any kind of sinful condition can have it the same way it's a faith amen that's a gift that come from god the ability to recognize god in the day that you live and say that's nothing but the truth so now paul is now he was part of that system he was a pharisee of the pharisees concerning the law he was blameless amen but when jesus christ came to him he had something to blame him about in the system he was blameless amen but he was persecuting jesus christ he was persecuting the manifested word and jesus had something to blame him of and so now paul he's doing the same thing he's taking the gospel back to its original back to the foundation back to abraham now verse 2 again for abraham we're justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness what else did he do he believed god how did he believe god he had a gift of faith he was a predestinated sea gene of god and he had the capacity within him when he heard the voice of god for his day amen he had the capacity to hear it and to receive it and to believe it amen and it was accounted to him for righteousness now him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin [Music] amen our sins are covered amen and righteous has been imputed on us by faith amen and god will not impute sin to that man but sometimes we impute it into ourselves by wrong thinking and wrong understanding on the scriptures blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin i just want to just share something that was just come to my heart i remember as a boy growing up in the pentecostal church i remember giving my heart to the lord and coming to an altar and crying and wanting to serve god and wanting to be saved i remember that experience amen and i remember going out and doing something wrong and i remember having to repeat that experience again and i remember going out and failing again and i remember having to come to the altar and repeat that experience again you see the problem was it was wrong teaching not that the repentance was wrong but that i was i was literally afraid that the time between that i the the time between that i failed god and failed his word to my death if i didn't have an opportunity to repent that i would die and be lost forever that's the way it was taught that's why people run to crash scenes to try to get somebody to pray for last minute just repeat after me or run to a parent's bedside just to get them to hear the word repent make this right you know because because they they think that that you can have something and then lose it and then in order to be saved and to go to heaven you have to regain it again before your death now when it comes to repentance and reconciliation and makes things right that's all true but when it comes to your salvation that's not true amen because that you if you're a child of god an election of god you were ordained before the foundation of the world you can no more be lost in god can be lost the message of the hours brought us correct teaching to wipe away that denominational teaching but unfortunately some of us had that ingrained in our mind before we came to the message and it takes a while to wash all of that out we may have got it from parents and we may have got it from preachers and we may have got it from one another we may have got it from our own human reasoning but we have to go back to the foundation that if i have ever been a son of god i have always been a son of god and i will always be a son of god that despite my failures my shortcomings my my personality things that i hate my my mistakes amen if i was ever part of god i'm always part of god and god is not losing himself and what could even give me the capacity as a total failure in life to believe that i can be part of god because there's something more than my brain amen there's something more than my willpower something more than my strength that has inside of me a desire for god it keeps bringing me back to him and an ability to accept his word the way he brings it in this day it's more than my mind it's more than my upbringing it's more than even my own will my will has failed me to be a son of god but the the faith inside of me has not failed amen my will and my desire and my passions to be a son of god to be a good christian to be a message believer all of those have failed me every one of them have failed me but there's one thing that hasn't failed that little c gene on the inside has never failed we got to come back to that foundation and quit being tossed about by every wind and every little happening and everything amen because we're never getting on to the place we need to be because we're constantly fooling around with first base we're constantly fooling around with well what am i am i this am i that and you know i say let's settle the question say god am i yours amen am i yours and and put the stake down when god comes and reveals himself to you and reveals who you are to you drive that stake down and don't dig it up again and don't go back to the foundation move on with god we have some of us that have that have hung around amen on the foundation way too long where we had an experience with god we had a change in our heart we had a literal change supernatural event that took place in our lives that moved us from one direction to another amen that put our heart and affection on god amen but because of wrong teaching something had us question that and we haven't been able to stop questioning that and because of that because we become so fixated on that we're not even able to do the greater works or what god has put us on this earth to do he didn't put us here to stay at the foundation but we're supposed to grow into the head in all things and become the image of jesus christ so let's keep reading verse 9 cometh as blessing this then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised and he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also what he's doing here is he's unbraiding the jews saying that that it wasn't just in circumcision it wasn't just for all the jews that have come to the law of circumcision and come after father abraham and the natural no he says abraham got this before he even got circumcision so it applies to all and he can be the father of all let's go to verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for their where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they are as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promised promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification so the fact that righteousness was imputed for abraham to believe was not just for abraham but it was for me and it was for you amen who can believe the way abraham believed abraham believed against hope he believed in hope against hope he believed what seemed to be impossible he believed the word of god when it was impossible for him to perform the word of god he believed it nonetheless when his body could not cooperate with what god had said he still believed the word when sarah's body would not cooperate he still believed the word and that faith in god and god alone without his ability amen oh let this come home friends let it come home abraham had no option but to believe god because he had no ability to perform the promise oh i wish we could get weak and feeble and needy and incredible and unable amen and quit trying to think that we can do something and if we do it right amen we'll be all right and get to the fact get to where abraham was when the promise came abraham and sarah tried to use a little intellect and a little reasoning and try to help god out and all they did was produce an ishmael but when they finally gave up on that and realized there's nothing i can do amen there's nothing i can do to make this happen amen and i believe anyways i believe without any ability in my body i believe without any ability in sarah's body and i believe without any workaround a handmaid or a he believed against hope i believe god is perfecting his bride and i believe god is perfecting me without my help amen i believe god is going to use me to do the greater works without my help amen he's going to do it because he said he's going to do it he's going to do it because he's promised to do it he's going to do it because it's his will and because he's able and all he needs is somebody who can believe and hope against hope amen who can believe i can come to the very nature of jesus christ and this body amen i can come to the very reflection of christ in this form how are you going to do it it's not going to be any of my old way of thinking or any of my old habits or any of my old attempts they all failed it's going to be a complete surrender to him and let jesus christ live his life through me it won't be me it'll be him i've already proved i can't do it abraham proved he couldn't do it in fact there was a time in abraham's life where he still could produce the promise but sarah couldn't and that was a deceptive time in the deception of him being able to do something about it but his wife not they came up with a plan that would work god's will amen by their own reasoning and she gave hagar because he was still capable and she wasn't and it looked like it was going to work amen but it wasn't amen that wasn't the plan of god and it was failure but praise god when he had no more hope when his stream of life had dried up and he couldn't even produce through a through a maid anymore the promise that's when he still believed if you've tried and failed and tried and failed and you've come to the point where he says i can't do it then you can express the faith of abraham now now's the time to believe in hope against hope amen to have hope against all hope now i want to read something here in romans in the last verse because i don't want our minds to go to the wrong place and verse 24 it says but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead so the the key is always to believe god that's the key always to believe god but i want to go to a couple scriptures so we don't lose sight of how god works let's go to matthew chapter 10. so you have to believe on him who raised up jesus from the dead so you have to believe in god matthew chapter 10 verse 40. he that receiveth you receive with me and he that receiveth me receive with him that sent me so there's still a modern day way to believe god let's go to luke chapter 10. luke chapter 10 verse 16 he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despises me and he that despises me despiseth him that sent me so we have to believe on god but he says if they hear you my disciples they hear me if they hear me they hear him that sent me if they despise you they despise me that despise me despise him that sent me so you see today there's still a voice of god on earth today there's still a voice there's still a word that's going out that's coming from god declaring a promise of god amen and you still have to believe on him who raised up jesus from the dead but believing on him you have to believe on who he sends to do the works of god you have to believe on who he sins and jesus was sending his disciples and if you heard if you heard who he sent you heard him if you heard him you heard who sent him and then you have the faith of abraham but if you despise who he sent then you despise him the new spies the one who sent him and you have not the faith of abraham so we can't leave this couple thousand years ago we got to bring it up right now today there's still the testing for the children of abraham let's go to john chapter 8. john chapter 8 and verse 45. and because i tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god the only way to hear god's word is to be of god let's go back to john chapter 6 and verse 35. there's much that we can say here but i'm just going to drop a couple points in and move on there's a lot we could say john chapter 6 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that you also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one that which seeth which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day this is interesting this is an interesting bit of language because don't just read the bible and just miss it but in order to be saved and raised at the end time you have to see the sun well this will destroy denominational thinking because if you have to see the sun and the sun was only in one form in the flesh form of jesus christ two thousand years ago well i haven't seen that amen unless i look at a an artist's rendition or whatever no but you can still see the son today because he is still manifest amen he's manifest on the earth and you can still see the sun and you must see the sun report of them but of all that the father's given him he will lose none that is his commitment and that's the father's commandment amen that's not your desire this is something we have to come down to and come let it come home and let it drive deep into your heart amen it's not you that wants god as god wants you amen the only desire you have is a reflection back of the desire he had for you and so we've got to we've got to realize that he came looking for the lost sheep the lost sheep didn't find the shepherd amen he came he left the 99 to find the one he he's the one who came he sought you out he found you you were his before you were lost but now you're found amen it wasn't adam who was calling out for god it was god who was calling out for adam setting the stage for what he would do for his sons for the rest of the bible and so we've got to come to terms with the fact that god will not lose his sheep and if i have something in me says i'm one of his sheep i will not be lost no man will pluck him out of the father's hand no one will pluck him out of the son's hand there's no sheep is going to be lost so we need to come to terms with that and know how to see the son in our day and how to hear the voice of god how do we hear the voice of god in our day amen you hear the word made manifest how do we see the son we see the son of man amen made manifest he's here today still working let's go to mark chapter 2. now i want to get into where i really wanted to get to mark chapter 2. i'm still i'm wanting to hammer this foundation down so hard and i feel like i could preach this every day to myself because we we got to have confidence in the word of god and our own actions our conduct and our own speech it betrays us sometimes it betrays the unbeliever in our minds because we speak in a way that leaves god out of the equation we speak in a way that puts our salvation on our own shoulders we speak in a way that puts our own keeping in our own shoulders and and we've got to get away from that language and get back to the language of the bible if if you have failed miserably today that means you're a son or daughter of god who has failed miserably today so could i repeat that for you you're a son or daughter of god who has failed miserably today that's still a good place to be you're not losing your sonship you're not losing your place in god that was established before before there was a molecule before there was stardust before before god was even god before he was an object of worship before there was anything to worship and before there was anything in the visible realm when there was an invisible god dwelling alone with his thoughts you were there and you were part of him amen and this message has come to bring us back to that realization so that we're not shaken amen by everything that goes on around us so that we have confidence in god how how is it that we're going to walk in this life amen how is it we're going to overcome things are getting darker amen there's going to be it's going to become more difficult as time goes on and we've realized it's not gotten easier it's getting harder but we've got to have something solid under our feet to keep moving and know that we're a child of god and god will provide for me and god has called me in this day and if he's called me in this day there's something he wants to accomplish and he will accomplish it and all i have to do is stand still and let god be god i gotta quit doubting i gotta quit questioning i just got to say god is god and i am his and i'm part of the program and he's going to do what he's going to do we're going to see i'm going to see the supernatural how do you know because i have no capacity to move this mountain he's i'm going to believe in him and he's going to do it amen because this is his plan his program this is his calling this is this is his this is his great drama that he saw in the in his mind before anything was ever made and i'm just going to trust in him you see we can never get to the faith to move a mountain if we're still not sure who we are and if we still are are doubting our relationship with god based off our conduct but we got to go back to a security that helps us to overcome all of those things mark chapter 2 verse 1 mark chapter 2 verse 1. and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noise that he was in the house and straight may many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they came unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was born born of four and when they could not come nigh unto the unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broke it up they let down the bed therein wherein the sick of the palsy lay when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sycapals his son thy sins be forgiven thee there's a reason that we read this so pay attention we're going to read the few stories like this but he says son thy sins be forgiven thee what did the man do what good works what acts of kindness where did he go make something right what pendants did he do where was his evidence where was his fruit what did he he knew that this was the power of god and he knew that god was in that man and he knew he and his friends knew that they had to get him who was sick of the palsy to that man because god was there amen and when i got there amen he knew that he would be healed that's why his friends peel back the thatching and the tile of the roof amen to drop him down because they already know that there will be results because they already know who's there and when jesus saw their faith he looked at the man that was sick and he says what did he say thy sins be forgiven thee based off what based off the fact that he could believe keep reading but there were certain of the scribes sitting there reasoning in their hearts why did this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only and immediately when jesus perceived in a spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason you these things in your hearts whether is it easier to say to the sick of palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know that the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion now listen they were amazed when that man took up his bed and began walking they were astonished they were amazed but i tell you what's more amazing was jesus looked at a man who did nothing didn't sacrifice something at the altar amen didn't make a pledge didn't make a vow but he just acted upon the faith that was in his heart and he got in the presence of jesus and jesus knew what was in him and what motivated him to get there and before he had an action before he had a conduct before he had a promise he would look at him and says thy sins are forgiven you amen to me if i could have one or the other i'd say leave me on the bed and forgive my sins but people are we're so fickle we're as human beings we're so caught up in the natural that we miss what's the greatest thing of all that this man didn't have to go to the temple he didn't have to give turtle doves he didn't have to he didn't have to slay a goat or a sheep all he had to do was recognize the living word for his day amen and by acting faith amen and when jesus saw his faith he immediately declared his sins forgiven and if that worked there does it work today amen is he still the same god operating by the same law is it still the same thing abraham had or is it something different today and i'd like to go on the record saying it's the same salvation it's the same imputation of righteousness it's the same god with the same plan as he's always had he's looking for somebody that can recognize the son that can see the son that can hear the voice and that can say i believe i believe it's the truth and i know it's the truth and he can look and say your sins are forgiven you not because you folded your hands not because you came to an author not because you acted out you may do all of those things that's fine but what he's looking at is that faith is what he's looking at somebody that'll believe him that'll seem for who he is for where he is for what he's doing listen the room was full of people and nobody else did he look at and say thy sins are forgiven me [Music] oh if we had the right revelation i'd have climbed up on the wall and said lower me next i believe i believe if it'll work for him it'll work for me that's the kind of believer i want to be friends i want to see god working and i want to jump in let's go to luke chapter 7. verse 44. i'm just going to go through a couple stories i just want you to see how clear this is in the scriptures these are basic things these are simple things but they're so fundamentally important to everyday life that if we move off of this foundation in everyday life we're going to wind up disheartened and we're going to wind up heartbroken and discouraged and depressed and uncertain and we're not going to take god at his word we're not going to claim the promise and stand on it we're not going to speak to the mountain because we're going to be we're going to be all uh uh in turmoil and caught up and uncertain but we've got to come back to this foundation and say no matter what happens i'm a son of god i'm a seed of god i'm faith seed of abraham god will never lose me he's done found me i'm in his hand amen and no man can pluck me out amen no matter what's going on around me i've got confidence in him and i've got confidence in what he wrote in the lamb's book of life amen it's been unsealed to me who i am and my name in that book and now nothing's going to change that see you can't become the master of circumstances till you know who you are luke luke chapter 7 verse 44. this is the house of simon and the pharisee and the woman come and she washed jesus feet she anointed him with oil swash them with the tears wiped it with her hair we get down to the end of the story it says and he turned to the woman and he said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gaves me no water from my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head though gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou that's not annoying but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven to catch that her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much to whom little was forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace it wasn't the oil it wasn't the tears it wasn't the hair those were all outcroppings of her face those were all that was what the spirit was moving her to do that was the inspiration she was under and she had faith she knew who this was she believed amen she believed that this was god god was working right here this is what's going on in our day and she gave everything she had to and she threw herself at his feet under inspiration of the holy ghost amen the inspiration is what everybody else saw amen they saw the oil the ointment the the hair and the tears amen but what jesus saw was her faith and he didn't say your sacrifice has saved you or your words have saved you he says your faith has saved you see how simple it is it's so simple we as human beings try to complicate it it's so basic so simple so easy that we get in our own heads and mess the simplicity of the gospel knob and then we handicap ourselves because of that luke chapter 18. luke chapter 18 verse 35. and it came to pass that he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging and hearing the multitude passed by he asked what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passed by passed by and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much more the more thou son of david had mercy on me and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sign and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith have saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god see he was crying out to the son of david he recognized that this is prophecy being fulfilled the pharisees wouldn't say that amen some of the other in the malta wouldn't say that but there was a blind man there who caught a revelation and said this is the very prophecy being fulfilled in our day and he cried out thou son of david and they were trying to get him to be quiet but jesus heard what he said and he said bring him to me he said what do you want he said i want to receive my side he said then receive your sight that you're saved your faith has saved you see he he had the capacity to believe that this was the day for the prophecy to be fulfilled others were doubting others were questioning others were mocking and saying horrible names about jesus but here was a little blind man amen who said down in his heart he said this is the son of david this is the prophecy this is the messiah god could see his faith there was a little woman who knew down in her heart that if i could but touch the hem of his garment i could be made every bit whole amen you realize friends this isn't it it's not that that she was repeating when anybody else had done this wasn't five steps to salvation this wasn't this wasn't the romans road to the sinner's prayer amen this was a spontaneous reaction amen an inspiration of the holy ghost amen where there was a seed on the inside that could recognize this man can help me and something is telling me that if i could just touch the hymn of his garment i could be made every bit whole this is real salvation this is real christianity this is not this is far beyond formalism and far beyond repeating after me and far beyond this step and this step and this step amen it's it's something that's down inside of an individual amen she may not have known she had that kind of faith amen the blind man didn't know he had that kind of faith the woman that washed jesus feet she may not have known she had that kind of faith but when she come in contact with the living word for her day something inside of her said i gotta get to him i've got to wash his feet amen when when blind bartimaeus was sitting at the the gate in jericho and he heard who was passing by amen that spontaneous well of faith came up and said thou son of david this is my chance this is the word for the hour this is the prophecy this is my time i'm calling out to you oh god save me do you think it'll be any different for us in this day amen what do we need to do whatever god is moving in your heart to do but to recognize who is here amen the prophecy is being fulfilled the word is made manifest you can see the sun you can hear his void the voice of the lord and you can respond in whatever way god is inspiring you to respond but he will see your faith and impute unto your righteousness and what makes us think it should be different than what abraham had or different than what the woman at the well god are different than what mary magdalene received or different than what blind bartimaeus got it may have come in a different way for each of them but it was based on the same thing it was based on their faith in the living word of god your story may be different in my story the inspiration that hit me i wept some dance one ran amen some brother branham went down the road jumping in the air and beating the air and shadowboxing your story may not look like my story but somehow i recognize this is him this is him amen and he can save me he can heal me amen this is the truth and he recognized my faith amen and he saved my soul don't complicate it friends don't make it difficult amen make it make it your story the reality that struck your heart the realization of who's speaking in this day the realization of who's present among us amen what this prophecy means what this word being fulfilled means amen and love it amen give yourself to it cry out to it whatever you have to do but just let him know lord i recognize you this is you and i love you don't worry he sees your faith even if nobody else sees it he sees it let's look at luke 19. luke chapter 19 we'll read verse 1. and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus come to the place he looked up and he saw he saw him and he said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house and he made haste and he come down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner and i'm going to stop right here and say jesus he never if we read through the gospels read through the scriptures we never have record of jesus complaining about sinners and we don't have jesus campaigning against abortion trying to close down all the beer joints do you understand jesus wasn't trying to stop prostitution and he wasn't trying to stop gambling do you have you read the bible jesus wasn't trying to bring a governments about you see the fallacy of denominationalism and christian thinking jesus's complaint his frustration was the unbelief in the religious systems he didn't talk about the prostitute and how horrible that was and the drunkard and how terrible that was he addressed the religion that was holding the people back from the truth that was what was horrible to him jesus could look at the system and he could complain about the pharisees and he'd call them he you know he didn't tell the prostitutes she was of her father the devil he said that to religious leaders because the prostitute was one of the sheep he was looking for and when he come in contact with that prostitute she believed him amen and he knew that she was a child of god but the pharisee was a child of the devil because that he was rejecting the word made flesh we have to be careful that 2000 years the denomination doesn't taint our understanding of the bible so now they're all worried and upset because jesus is going to the house of a sinner but jesus only that which the father showed him he knew this was a lost sheep he's only he's only sinner temporarily because he's really a believer he just doesn't know it yet he's really a child of god he just hasn't had the opportunity to express it yet you see what i'm saying so he says verse 7 again and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner and zach he has stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost he made the declaration listen it looks almost like he made it based off zacchaeus promise but listen jesus declared salvation coming and zacchaeus lost before zacchaeus did one of those things that he promised to do what was it what was it that zacchaeus was doing amen it was the same thing the woman that the well was doing it was the same thing the woman that washed his feet was doing it was the same thing blind bartimaeus was doing he came in contact with the living word and it changed him and he stood up and said i don't want to be like this anymore i'm going to make everything right and it wasn't the declaration of making it right or the action of making it right that brought salvation to his house it was his ability to recognize the lord jesus christ and and change amen and have a change of heart and want to be different what if zacchaeus forgot one of those people he cheated jesus already made the declaration salvation has come to this house because he believed not because he got every penny paid back just right and he didn't forget and he had good letters and he went back and after he made it all right and proved that what he said was true and then god says okay now i've come back and i've checked and forgot this and you're off by 10 cents but that's how we think sometimes we've i've talked to i've talked to a lot of people brothers and sisters i've talked to a lot and my heart just breaks you have people get twisted around by the devil and and they've been saved they've given their heart to the lord had an experience with the lord and ten years later they're wondering about i don't remember if i went back and repented for everything i ever did wrong it's like are you kidding me do you think god is requiring that you remember amen when you were 10 years old and you took your brother's hot wheel never gave it back to him amen you're repenting for your unbelief you're repenting for not recognizing the lord and when you recognize him you're giving yourself to him it's not going back and saying i took this from you and i took that from you and remember the other day and we've had people who questioned their new birth they may question whether or not based off something they remembered that they hadn't made right and they thought they made it right should i go back and make this writer should i go back and say something just believe him just believe him if he moves on your heart to go make something right go make it right but don't base your salvation on that if god brings a conviction on your heart and he brings a memory to you something that you need to go and reconcile go reconcile it but don't put your salvation in your walk on the lord on hold and say i i i'm not even off first base now i thought i was the third base i thought i was rounding the home but i'm not i'm not even off the starting line i got to go back and make this right and then i got to come back to the beginning just believe him just give him your whole heart just believe him just believing for who he is in this day believe the lord and if he moves on you to make something right make it right and just let that be your father dealing with the son but don't go back to doubting whether or not you're saved or born again amen because i remember that when i repented i don't know if i fully repented i might need to get baptized again because i remember that i didn't fully amen the devil is just twisting people up jesus didn't do these people this way when he saw their faith he said you're saved your faith has saved you you're saved by faith saved by grace through faith and that are yourselves it's a gift of god amen and after you realize you're a child of god born again amen by the spirit of god and if your father says there is something back there i want you to make right you say yes father i'll go make it right because i'm your son and i'm born again and amen and i'm believing all that you told me the devil's played too many games for too long we've got to come back to this kind of belief this kind of faith what the lord demonstrated he said you know you don't see jesus getting frustrated with the harlot and the drunkard do you do you see that in the scriptures anywhere do you see him going up to a bunch of and said what is wrong with you why don't you guys get your life together what does he do he does what his father tells him to do and the manifestation of the hour attracts the seed of the hour because his business is to gather the lost sheep not to come up with a program that'll transform bad lives into good lives and reform people's attitudes and approaches and behaviors he's there to seek the lost sheep and the only way to find the lost sheep is for the manifestation of the word for that hour the living christ will attract the sheep and they'll be saved by faith but who does the lord get frustrated with if he doesn't get frustrated with the drunkard and the prostitute and the tax collector who does he get frustrated with listen this may sound odd but he gets frustrated with his disciples doesn't he you know there's a lot of scriptures i've got you can pull my notes off and go do them but i'm just gonna we're just gonna talk because we all know the bible he looks at peter one day and he starts to try to get the disciples in the program of god he says you know i'm going to go to jerusalem and the son of man will be evenly mistreated and he'll be killed rise again on the third day and peter says far be it for me he begins to rebuke the lord he begins to rebuke the lord says the lord forbid for me he says get thee behind me satan now he didn't call the prostitute satan or the drunkard satan or the tax collector satan it was peter because peter was still relying on his human thinking he wasn't getting with the program of god he was not getting in the rhythm of the word the word was speaking but he was still using his intellect he was still using his reasoning he was using his human affection and he wasn't just getting with the rhythm of the word he had two disciples when when there was a city who refused to receive jesus there's two disciples said shall we bring fire from heaven down and burn them up and he says you don't even know what spirit you're of because they're not getting with the program he says the son of man is not has come to save life not to destroy life see jesus is not worried about what's going on out there he's worried about the children of god coming to the word of god and manifesting the life of god you don't even know what spirit you're of and then he he goes to the disciples and he gets in a ship and they're they're going from one side to the other and a storm comes up and the the storm beats vehemently on the ship and now there's no hope that they're going to be saved and they wake jesus because jesus is asleep in the boat and they wake him and says do you not care that we die and he says oh ye of little faith how long must i endure this he stands on the bow of the ship and he speaks to the storm it says peace be still he he has peter he comes to peter walking on the water one day and peter says if lord that you bid me come and he says come and he starts coming then he begins to look around and he begins the fear and he begins the doubt and he begins to sink he says lord save me and the lord reached down and picked him up and walked him back to the ship because he's a son he's not going to let him drown he's got work to do when he gets him back there he says why for did thou doubt o thee of little faith jesus wasn't frustrated with the unbelieving world he was frustrated with those who were supposed to believe and we're doubting he was frustrated with the church that was supposed to receive him when they wouldn't receive he was frustrated with his own disciples who had given the word he had demonstrated the sign of the messiah he had showed him that he would provide he would provide bread and he would stop storms and then he could pass through crowds and still they get to the next trial the next trial they begin to cry and fall apart and oh don't you care about us won't you save us and he says why do you have such little faith he gets frustrated when a man with an epileptic child comes and says lord pray for my child i asked your disciples but they couldn't cast them out because how long will i be with this perverse generation this unbelieving and perverse generation where was jesus frustrated with not the ranked center he was frustrated with those who were supposed to believe and i just want to close by saying i don't want to be the kind of disciple that he's frustrated with i want to believe amen i want to stand on the foundation of the world i want to believe that what he said he'll do amen i want to believe that when if he called me i'm his and he'll take care of me and then if he says that he'll not lose one sheep he's not going to lose this sheep amen if sickness strikes he won't lose me till this purpose with me is done on the earth amen if if financial crisis if family troubles if church troubles if government troubles if whatever troubles come amen i'm not going to begin to say oh god amen where are you don't you care that i drown don't you care that we die but i want to have the kind of faith that says god i'm watching to see what you're going to do because you've got promises that won't fail i believe you amen i believe you're that i am who you said i was and i'm not going to change that statement amen because i get into trouble or a hard time or things go wrong but if you said i'm your son i'm your son if you call me sheep i'm sheep and that makes you my shepherd and i have a shepherd i shall not want see it wasn't it wasn't the prostitute on the side of the road that upset jesus it was his own disciple who saw the manifestation were close to the manifestation the word saw the supernatural provision and still grumbled complain whined misunderstood you know i said we come back to a foundation faith the foundation of a statue of a perfect man but i said it's going to take this kind of faith every day to overcome the obstacles of the day i can't give up my sonship because everything goes wrong i can't doubt the delivering power of the lord just because he hesitates to deliver for a moment i can't doubt i can't start listen we're all human beings we're all frail we fight the same enemy i can't start going down the road of god hasn't answered my prayer there must be something wrong in my life there's something i've done and i don't know what i've done but he's mad at me now you might not say the word mad at me but that's our attitude you know i want to be the kind of son that says i've got a heavenly father and if there's anything hindering the word in my life he'll show it to me i don't have to guess or be fearful i don't have to go back through and comb through my memory bank and say oh it was the paper clip it was the paper clip from work that's just human reasoning that's just us trying to figure out why things aren't working and we have no idea things might be working perfect when they got in the storm things were still working perfect you know we don't want to we don't want to start off in faith and drop back in reasoning we don't want to start off believing god for everything and fall back to well i wonder what's wrong something's wrong i've done something wrong just say god if i've done something wrong show me i'm your son i believe you'll show me and if you show me give me the strength to make it right but until then i'm going to believe your word you're going to heal me you're going to deliver me you're going to bring me through this you're going to bring me through the valley of the shadow of death because you are my shepherd and you have not left me because the word says you won't leave me it doesn't matter what i feel the word says you won't leave me it doesn't matter how i feel but the word says you're my good shepherd the word says that i'm in your hand the word says no man shall pluck me out of your hand i'm not even able to pluck myself out of your hand i'm going to stick with the word i want to i want to get to a place where i can have that kind of simple faith that the woman who washed his feet had i mean i doubt she didn't have it all thought out she didn't even bring a towel right blind bartimaeus didn't have time to think it all out he just acted by inspiration and faith the woman at the well she didn't have time to plan what's going to happen if i meet somebody who answered my questions today but there's something in here that can respond by faith to the situation and i want to live by faith in who i am and who he is and that who this who the word is and what day we live in and what hour this is and what my position is in christ i'm seated in christ in heavenly places how is he not going to take care of me he's in me and i'm in him how is he not going to provide for me how will i go hungry how will he not heal this body how will he not provide for every need he's in me and i'm in him i'm seated now in heavenly places i'm part of his bride how will he not take care of me and if i need corrected he'll correct me amen but i don't have to correct myself and i don't have to imagine things that are wrong i just trust in him and walk forward and keep believing that he'll provide everything and that he'll move every mountain and apart every sea because he's my heavenly father he's my husband he's the word made manifest today and i believe him i want to have the simple faith of zacchaeus the simple faith of the woman that washed his feet the simple faith of the woman at the well the simple faith of blind bartimaeus i want to have that kind of faith and i want to have it every day i want to build on the foundation and i want to grow into the head into christ i want to grow into the stature of a perfect man but you always listen no matter how high you grow in the statue of a perfect man you're still on the foundation of faith no matter how far you go you're always on the foundation of faith everything is based on faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of god if you have the capacity to believe this word not from your head but from your heart then you should be able to trust god let's go to john chapter 10. i want to read two more scriptures and then we're going to close john chapter 10 verse 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me listen if that doesn't make your heart swell right now i don't know what will i was his sheep before before what before i was born he found me i didn't find him he the one who he come he come searching me out saying chad chad where are you chad chad where are you he knows me and i follow him it's already programmed into the plan i'm going this is the nature of sheep and shepherds 28 and i give unto thee eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one if you're his sheep he knows you and you follow him and no man can pluck you out of his hand and no man can pluck you out of his father's hand and his father is greater than all and he and his father are one let's go to luke 15. musicians if you'd like to come brother ben if you make your way up please luke 15. verse 4. luke 15 verse 4 what man of you having a hundred sheep if you lose one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it he searches until he finds it it was already his sheep he's not looking for new sheep god in this day christ is not looking for new sheep he's only looking for his sheep but he'll leave the 99 and go after the one and he will search until he finds it he won't lose one listen we have a heavenly father we are sheep of his pasture he gave us something to believe with let's have confidence in that tell the devil to leave he says to resist the devil and he shall flee when he comes with all the doubts and questions and starts questioning your foundation and whether you've done right or why things aren't working out for you just go back to the simplicity of saying but i know this is him and i know i belong to him hallelujah don't frustrate him by how many times has he delivered you how many times has he provided for you how many times has he fed you how many times have we come service after service needing something from god and god gives it how many times have we needed god to answer a prayer we had no solution to the problem and we just waited and waited and all of a sudden solution came without effort sometimes without planning it come from outside of our scope of imagination but god just resolved the issue that was in front of us without our efforts how many times has he done that so the next time you get in the boat and the waves are beating don't be like the disciples don't make him say why how long do i have to bear with you or you little faith but let's grow up into mature christians and say lord you've done it before and you'll do it again amen nothing has changed between me and you i still believe you for who you are and i'm still your sheep amen and if you did it before you'll do it again amen i don't want to be like the disciples he was frustrated with i don't wanna i don't wanna let reasoning and fears and anxieties amen take away the truth that i hold in my heart that he is my god and he is my shepherd and he is able and though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death he'll not leave me thou art with me we've got to grow up and start acting like adults at some point amen we start have to start acting like a mature bride of jesus christ and quit being children you got to come to a place where our whole world is falling apart when everything it seems like is going wrong amen we've got to get to the place where we say but all is well all is well you know the the woman who made the little room for elijah and she gave him a child and that child died she goes writing to elijah she has a dead baby a dead baby when she gets to elijah says is all well she says all is well listen elijah was the manifestation of the word for that day and when she came to the living word for her day she knew all as well and i want to have that kind of faith that no matter what's going wrong i want in my heart to say all is well and my mind is screaming a million reasons to protest i want to shut the mind down and say all is well amen this may be a valley of the shadow of death but it only proves that he's with me the scripture's still true amen my position is still true amen my sonship is still secure amen his love for me is still in place nothing has changed everything is still as it was i'm not going to let this circumstance rob me of faith i'm not going to let the circumstance rob me of my security amen my security comes from the word let's all stand i tell you this is a simple message as simple as simple a message you can get but it's one that if we could catch and live it'll change every day no more running around amen no more ringing hands no more amen losing our minds in every difficult situation no more speaking such horrible things when things are going wrong there's so many times i've had to repent for the words that come out of my mouth in the trial i mean words like don't you care don't you see i'm probably not the only one who's cried that out midnight one o'clock in the morning god don't you see don't you care don't you know but i don't want to be like that anymore i want to say god i know you see and i know you care and i know you're watching over me and give me the strength to pass through this trial because i know when i'm tried i shall come forth as gold i know this is for good i know this is for my benefit i know this is for your glory lord because you made these promises to me and they're still true it's a simple message but oh it's not simple it's profound if we could live this way every day then you'll see the greater works then you'll see mountains move then you'll see things change no more whining no more complaining but just a quiet confidence a steadiness that says god is still on the throne i'm still a sheep and he's still my shepherd and though it looks bad all is well all is well let's bow our heads and pray your heavenly father lord i don't always understand why why you have us preach certain things at certain times but i know it's you lord and i know it's meeting a need right now and wherever that need is lord i pray that you'd come and pour supernatural divine oil bring a healing and a confidence and a security to those who need it lord forgive us father forgive us for our little faith forgive us lord for constantly coming back and whining and doubting and questioning but god help us to grow into mature believers lord wash all the unbelief away lord move away all doubt and all insecurity lord and let us live lord on the bedrock of foundation foundation of faith lord believing you trusting you recognizing you oh god we love you lord and we thank you for the day you've called us in it may be troublesome on every side but it's a good day prophets and wise men have longed to see this day and have it but we get to see it lord and it may be troubling to the flesh and it may be difficult amen on the emotional realm but all they would have longed to be here if they could but you've allowed us to be here help us not waste our opportunity lord for we only get one opportunity in this life let us not waste it and squander it with feebleness and weakness lord and in our soul but help us to have confidence and steadfastness and security in your word help us lord to stand fast and watch you work help us to take all of our confidence off of ourselves and put it on you lord if we could just transfer all the responsibility and all of the pressure and we could just lay it on your shoulders where it belongs and just let you care for us lord if we could just have peace in the midst of the trial if we just have peace in the midst of the storm knowing that you got everything in control lord it would be a testimony to all around us help us father forgive us increase our faith oh lord move away every doubt forgive us of our unbelief help us with our own belief but help what's in the soul to come out move the reasoning away and the doubts in the mind and the questions about move it away lord let your light penetrate through all of that and your word may bring a greater manifestation of what's already inside of us lord we yield ourselves to you lord we commit ourselves to you afresh have your way with us in jesus christ's name amen i just want to say just give an observation and take it for what it's worth because my observation may be wrong but sometimes when we begin to question based off the circumstances our ability to overcome the trial whatever's going on you just name it you just pick your trial and we begin to doubt whether we'll get through it past it around it or we can overcome or we'll be overcome by it or when we start to have all this turmoil it's a clear indication that we're operating out of flesh rounds and that we're actually putting our confidence in our ability to overcome and it's a good indicator when you start to see that when you really say i don't know how we're going to get through i don't know how i'm gonna do this i i don't see any way possible i just don't know what i'm gonna do i can't overcome this when you start to talk like this you've you've put your confidence in yourself and i say that's the time to say oh god forgive me it's all in you you bought me i'm not my own i belong to you you purchased me with your own blood i am your child i am your bride i am your wife you chose me you selected me you called me you told me to come unto you i've done what you said and now i realize i can't overcome i can't fix this amen but you can and you will i don't know how you will i don't know how you'll make it all work out but i believe you will we sometimes we express where we are by the things we're worried about in our attitudes we need to check ourselves sometimes and say am i depending on me to get through this or am i trusting in him we need to go back to trusting in him and then quiet down little bride settle down it's okay everything is under control amen let's just sing brother in jesus above
