TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's good to be together again and may the lord bless us as we look into his word amen let's take our bibles and turn to daniel chapter 12 together i want to start on the revelation of the seven seals we go ahead and bring that first slide up that's all right brother franco and uh i just want to take our time and look at this i don't want to rush through it and i i really want to dig in and see what's here and i'm going to read some quotes through that will explain to you why i really want to spend some time here on the seals if you've been a message believer for any length of time at all you've heard the term seals right and you've probably heard it over and over and over again and we just want to make sure we take the time not to breeze over that like as if we already understand everything there is understand about that because that was the greatest thing that ever happened in the ministry of brother benham he's pointing to it he's referring to it he's talking about it even for the rest of his ministry so the revelation of the seven seals was a major thing it wasn't just one-week services that he moved on it was much more than that to the prophet of god it should be much more than that to us we just pray that god would reveal it to us the way he wants to and let's look together in revelations chapter 12 verse 8 while you're yet standing verse 8 says and i heard but i understood not and then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so daniel wanted to know he heard but he didn't understand and he wanted to know the interpretation of these things and and he says go thy way daniel for the words are sealed up till the time of the end have we come to the time of the end we've come to the time when the words are no longer sealed up it says many shall many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand hallelujah brother branham told us that daniel saw this opening of the seven seals amen and here he's here he's asking you know for more information he says no it's sealed up till the time of the end but he's telling us at the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried so at this time when these things are unveiled it has an ability to purify amen and make white and and he says the wicked shall not understand but the wise shall understand that's why we don't say i don't understand those seals they don't mean anything to me boy we need to pray for revelation and say if it was important to your prophet it was important to you that you would bring a prophet on the scene and you would build an entire worldwide ministry just so you could open the seals i don't want to say i don't understand it i don't care i don't need to understand it you said the wise will understand and i'm saying lord give me revelation so that i can be one of those wise to understand what you want me to understand amen let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless his word dear heavenly father we thank you god that we could be here today lord we pray that you would just open the words to us lord we can open a bible we can read black ink on white paper lord but without a revelation from you it will do us no good nor we've come to the time lord where you've opened these things and you want us to understand i just pray that you bring us a spirit of revelation lord that we might see you as you are we might see lord what you want us to see and god that we might be made pure and white and rapture ready lord by these revelations we ask that you would do this for us in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen you can take your seats let's turn to the book of revelations revelations chapter 10 this passage in daniel 12 when revelations chapter 10 go right together the same thing hallelujah it's one thing that that the prophet of god has done for us by revelation is he has connected the bible and he's made it one book he hasn't it's not 66 books it's one book amen and and it's just amazing once you see the theme running through the whole bible and that's really where we want to get into this this morning revelations chapter 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice is when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so we're seeing the same thing that daniel went through is now what john is going through verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets hallelujah i can't i can't read that without being happy i cannot read that passage of scripture without being thrilled that the mystery of god is finished amen as he hath declared to his servants the prophets you see right here we understand that that there is an opening of this sealed book and i'll go to the next slide this is the way brother branham describes this or at least as best as i can understand from the message that there's one rolled up and sealed on the end and another one wrapped around that and and we see that when john looks in in revelations chapter 6 chapter 5 he sees the lamb take the book in chapter 6 he sees him tear open the seals but when he opens the seals there he opens it in symbol form so the mystery comes out from god and after it comes out from god it's manifest in a symbol of white horse and red horse and all of that but what the symbol means the interpretation of the symbols wasn't given at that time so what we see is the book is unsealed in revelations chapter 5. that's why in revelations chapter 10 he comes down with an open book and and and then seven thunder's utter and brother brahm tells us the seven thunders are the interpretation of the seals of the symbols those are they're revealing what the symbols mean amen but then john heard that john knew what the thunders were he knew what the revelation of the symbols were but he was told not to write it now he's told before write everything that you see all right you're in the vision write everything that you see but he comes to this is write it not why because it must be sealed till the time of the end amen until the the voice of the seventh angel then the mystery of god could be finished so something else had to happen so we find out now we have a sealed book coming from god the lamb takes it and unseals it in symbol form the thunders roar and reveal the symbols and then the book is sealed up again that's why brother branham says it was sealed on the inside and on the back side two sets of seals because you see two sets of seals see a set of seals broken in revelations chapter six and you see a set of seals you see it sealed again in revelations chapter 10 until we come to the revelation of the seven seals in 1963 and then you hear the seven thunders which is the opening of those second set of seals we got that so many times we read the message that could be so confusing i mean you know what's confusing and i'll just i'll say it this way i may have said this before is what's confusing about the message what's confusing about all prophecy is you're not seeing what the prophet seeing if you were seeing what the prophet seeing you would understand exactly what he's saying and this is true when you read in in i think it's mayhem i can't remember exactly where it is in the old testament he starts talking about these chariots and they have lights and they're jostling about and going to and fro and it's really difficult to make out what he's referring to these lights and they're jostling about in the way and oh i don't understand what he's saying until brother branham says what the prophet saw was a vision of the outer drive of chicago now the minute you can see what he's seeing you know what lights on a highway on the outer drive in chicago would look at at night on a busy highway you could see the chariots with lights jostling about in the way and all of a sudden clear as a bell i know what nah's talking about you see and that's what's so difficult until you can see what the prophet's seeing he's telling you as accurately as he can tell you what he sees but until god can give you a revelation so you can see what he sees it's all mystery and darkness and it looks like it looks like he's contradicting statements and they're not they're just different pieces of information about the same thing so he says those two sets of seals he talks about the seals on the inside and the back side there's not 14 seals it's seven seals but it was broken symbol form amen then it was revealed to john but john was told not to write to seal the thunders which is the revelation of the symbols and then the last breaking of the seals in 1963 the seven thunders was to break those seals and reveal the details or the interpretation of the symbols when you see what the prophet sees it's a piece of cake now when he said that that second set of seals piece of cake but before it's like what there's is there seven or fourteen and it's only ever been seven same things over and over it's just amazing so brother branham gets into the to the seven seals here and we're gonna read some quotes and and talk about some things he says the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seven church age the last church age all the loose ends through these church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broken the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of his coming i love that quote i just that just settles you right down and put you right in position amen it's so good so we want to look at these seals for just a minute and and i want to take a a uh take my time i'm trying very very desperately to take my time we've got plenty of time we've got plenty of services we can take a month on this if we need to and so i i just appreciate you being patient with me i just want to make sure that we we step through this together he says in the breach the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and being it's on the back side is because it's wound up the seal mystery is on the inside and only says the white horse writer the black horse rider and what more on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from genesis to revelations a complete plan of the redemption is revealed in the seven seals now this is an interesting statement because if you take the seven seals the information that comes forth is the white horse rider and the lion anointing and the red horse rider and the ox and brother brenham lays that he takes those those horse riders and he lays it right over the church ages all right and he goes through the church ages and and then he goes to souls that are under the altar of referring to the jews from the time of christ onward and then he goes into the sixth steal which goes to the two witnesses the seventh trumpet and the calling out of the 144 thousand so if you look at that it would look to you like the seals cover the time from matthew mark luke and john until revelations but he's saying these seals are the complete plan of redemption is revealing these seals it's from genesis to revelations so these seals have the mystery of the entire bible not just the new testament church not just the experience of the new testament believers but there's a there's a plan of redemption there's something that's locked in these seals that when it's revealed will reveal the entire plan of redemption from genesis to revelations hallelujah that'll pop your pee brain it pops mine because i've been looking so much at details i got the details okay this horse rider he wrote in this period and this horse rider he wrote in this period and this is what he did and and i was just looking at the information within the seals and i wasn't backing up to get the big picture of what it was all about and that's what i hope we get to i hope we can get to the big picture he says again now we go to breaking these seals you're going to see it's plumbed back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the bible lays in these seals now if you take that with the understanding of just the information that's locked into the seals as far as when the horse riders rode and the anointing when you do that how can every mystery of the bible be in those seals if he's talking about something that happened just to the gentile church it's got to be showing more than just what happened to the gentile church every mystery of the bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken till that time brother branham says here in souls that are in prison now but one day he rose from there come forth there was the book at it was still in the abstract owner god almighty and john looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mysteries was in the seven seals when these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible are we catching the theme it didn't unlock the history of the new testament church it didn't reveal what the devil was doing to the gentile church it unlocked amen it opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it so we understand now that god has had a book of redemption and this book of redemption had the record of the redeeming of the entire seed of christ the whole the whole seedline of god was in this and he said this book was written before the foundation of the world he said the bible was written and he said the bible and the book of redemption are the same thing and this was written before the foundation of the world amen it wasn't written when isaiah began to pen and ezekiel began to pen and matthew and mark and luke and john when they began to write it that's not when the bible was written that was when the bible was transcribed but the bible was written in the mind of god before the foundation of the world the book of redemption was written and sealed amen in god's mind before the foundation of the world and that means if you're part of the book of redemption if you can find yourself in the bible then that was recorded in heaven before the foundation of the world before there was dust or stars or even space or time or anything else that materialized that way before that you were already sealed under those seven seals and that means nothing will unseal you from that book of redemption hallelujah the revelation of the seven seals it's here to awaken us up the strip spiritually amnesia away from us so we can recognize who we are where we came from what we're doing where we're going what is the whole purpose amen hallelujah that's what the that's what the ministry of brother brahm came to do came to wake us out of spiritual amnesia came to pull the scales back off of our eyes so that we could see a bigger picture than just i was born in 1970 something and i lived this many years and i married so and so and had this many children if that's all that we can see we've got to take the blinders off because there's a lot more to you than that there's a lot more to your purpose here than that purpose we've got to find out what is in the mind of god and he has given it he's unlocked the mystery of god it is finished it is unveiled and now we have to receive it by revelation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now just so we can read here what brother branham says about each of these seals now if you notice when he gets into the sales i mentioned this before but when he goes to mention the the information or the details like the white horse rider it's the antichrist spirit it begins to ride through a saying and becomes a doctrine of the nicolaitans and the first church age he starts to lay that out when he lays that out and explains all of that he can do that in usually about 10 or 15 minutes if everybody understands what i'm saying he can give you that lump of information of what this is and where it was in the church age and what it did he can give you that information in just a few minutes but listen to what he says here in the first seal did you get to study in jeremiah how he wrote that many of you taking it down last night how them seals were wrote and placed away for keeping until he returned after the 70 years of captivity we ministered on that several weeks ago and talked about the open and closed book of jeremiah but anyways he goes on to say he was to return back and claimed his possession and i certainly like to study it there's no way to express it all because it's an eternal word it's an eternal book and therefore we just have to kindly hit the high places and today in studying i've written down many scriptures so you can study it and also in the tapes we'll reveal much of it as you study it he goes on in the second seal and he says now then if amos says in the other scriptures that go with it if you remember on this we're just striking the highlights of it when i get in that room there and that anointing comes in if i could write down what all goes on i'd be here for three months on one of the seals hallelujah i can tell you right now i can't spend three months on one of the seals we need a greater revelation we need god to open our eyes if the prophet of god said if i would write down everything that goes with it when the anointing comes and i see it when he unfolds it amen and i see it he goes if i'd write it all down i could spend three months on each seal i said god we need more there's something else in the seals for us there's more for us lorne hallelujah i'd be here for three months on one of the seals so i just strike the places and let it out just what it would seem to be that wouldn't choke the people but yet not enough to hurt them but just so that believing it would it seasoned the thing you know what i mean so here he's telling you that each one of these seals has a massive amount of information with it and i'm just sprinkling out just a little bit and just hitting the high places oh i'm excited that means there's more there's more revelation there's more word this is the mystery of the entire bible this is the whole book from revelation genesis to revelation all sealed up in these seven seals it's got to be more than what i can explain in 30 minutes it's got to be more than what i can share with somebody in a simplistic way and say well is this white and red and it's got to be more than that there's something more to this amen hallelujah i love that he says and god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him he said it's hard if you don't you have to depend on the holy spirit because this bible is wrote in riddles you just can't sit down and read it like a newspaper it's hid that's exactly what jesus said he said it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and it's revealed amen it's hidden and it's revealed it's not learned amen it's not through much study it's hidden and it's revealed and it's hidden from the wise and fruit and revealed it unto the babes what babes the seed line of christ that's who it's revealed to yes sir he said so so you can't sit down and read it like a newspaper it's hid and i would say you can't sit down and read the book of the revelation of the seven seals like you read a newspaper you can't get off of it the information like you get out of a newspaper there's got to it's hid amen the word of god is hid and it's revealed praise the lord i think that's so amazing because brother branham came and he was a word prophet you can't make him anything but a word prophet and a word prophet speaks like a word prophet and if you go back and you read all of the word prophets those word prophets were speaking things they would be laying down a prophecy and they would be jumping thousands of years in their sentences and you're reading and you think all of this has to happen at this period of time or all has to happen to here and they'll be speaking about a specific period of time and they'll throw right inside of that prophecy a prophecy pertaining to something 2000 years later because that's how a word prophet speaks because the bible is written in mysteries the bible is written in riddles you can't just read it like a newspaper that's why seminaries in schools and in bible schools and bible classes is never going to do a thing to get you to understand god amen it comes by revelation and the revelation is to the babes hallelujah praise the lord so he goes on to say you can't sit down and read it like a newspaper it's hid yes sir how would you ever justify god when he told moses up there now don't you make any engrave an image it's a commandment don't you make anything like heaven any angel or anything else don't make any engraven images and yet on the same day told them to mold two angels out of brass and put them right at the mercy seat where mercy's at see he had him up on the mountain mount sinai and he gives him the ten commandments and he tells them not to make any graven image no graven image of anything that's made on earth no graven image of anything that's made in heaven don't make a graven image and then he tells them to make a graven image hallelujah hallelujah you can't read the bible like you read a newspaper see he says see you have to know god and his nature before you can understand his word he has the key to that word himself he's the only one can handle it and open it and so he's the one that has to reveal it and so now what we find out is is brother branham is is very clear you have to know god and his nature before you can understand his word who better to understand the nature of god than the expressed attributes of god who can better comprehend god and understand god than those that came out from god they they're the only ones on this earth that can receive revelation and understand the nature of god because at one time they were in god they're part of god amen there's an eternal sieging of god down inside of your soul if you're a child of god that came from god it's the word and when the word comes it connects to the word not to your mind not to your brain not to your understanding but it's the word connecting to the word that eternal coming to the eternal amen and it quickens that seed to life amen now those are the ones amen that that that could understand his nature if you didn't come from god how will you overstand his nature hallelujah god is good brothers and sisters that's why when somebody come up to brother brown and say brother ma'am you just don't know your bible very well he said that may be right but i know the author awfully well and i'd say which would you rather know which would you rather know the ink splotches on paper amen there's a lot of people who memorize the ink splotches on paper and have no idea who god is who christ is they think jesus christ was only the man that walked the sea of galilee and they don't know he's the word they don't recognize him today when he's being made manifest when he's here among us in the revelation of the word they have no idea who he is they don't know his nature they don't know him but they've memorized whole chapters out of the bible they've read the bible multiple times they know the greek they may be able to read it in the original manuscripts but it doesn't mean anything unless you know his nature and if you don't know his nature you won't know him and the best way to know his nature is to have his nature hallelujah i would i would rather know him amen than know about him amen you can quote me dates and dispensations and and have everything neatly tucked together but i would rather know him than know about him but all the children of god want both they want to know him and they're hungry to know all about him that's why we want to know because we love him hallelujah praise the lord i get excited so we find that the seals have been opened now nobody can open the seals but the lamb himself nobody you can't brother branham couldn't nobody could it had to be the lamb and the seals are broken and they were preached and the revelation was given out but you still have to have the lamb to break the seals he still has to give revelation of his word amen praise god i want to look at two vines now this may seem like a diversion from the seals but it's not this is the this is a fundamental principle that will help you understand the seals have to understand that there's two vines there's satan and then there's christ hallelujah the latest in church age out of the church age book he said this is the end time both the true false true and false vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripe and tares must be bound for the burning they're all joining the world council of churches that is the binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two spirits are at work in two vines he didn't say there were four five six spirits on the earth two didn't say there were five or six vines two two spirits two vines amen praise the lord we're gonna get into some fun stuff it says that day on calvary and sin did not start on earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same bases he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble so you can't say sin began at the garden of eden sin began in heaven amen when lucifer rebelled against god and disobeyed the word of god that's where it began that's where your other vine begins so there's two vines but the two vines begin right there and then the two vines spill down upon earth and then you're watching this whole bible is the record of two vines so if you read this it's a record of two vines and that's what the seals does is begins to explain to you the nature of two vines and the tactics of two vines and the way two vines operate and you begin to see what started in heaven is passing all the way from genesis unto revelations where finally one of those vines is cut off and destroyed it's not the true vine it's not the eternal vine it's another vine that's cut off but brother ram says this and the sea does not air with the shock notice see how close it looks matthew now now we've got to be very very careful here in our minds and see that this is a principle that's laid down and this principle is not going to change it is so deceptive that it would deceive the very elective possible and in brother branham's day he's pointing to the pentecostal church the pentecostal church and and it's got all the manifestations gifts of the spirit they're doing all of these things and you've got to be careful but brother branham said they said in another hundred years if time goes on the pentecostal church will be farther away than the catholic church is and we've been 50 years since that time just over 50 years since he made those statements amen and so it cannot be that the pentecostal church is going to deceive the bride why because they're on their road to becoming as bad as the catholic church amen they've gone down further there must be a closer deception than the pentecostal church because the elect is not going to be deceived by the denominational system amen hallelujah god is good i want to read a couple scriptures if you can turn with me let's go to isaiah 59 no i'm sorry that's not the one i want ezekiel 28. let's go to ezekiel first ezekiel 28 verse 11. this is going to be a perfect example of how a word prophet speaks and and we'll get to see here firsthand ezekiel chapter 28 verse 11. moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and send him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god so here he begins to speak and he there's an earthly king that he's going to speak to and he says he says take a lamentation against the king of tyrus and he starts talking about lucifer who's been in eden why because what is the anointing working in that king it's the same anointing he's not addressing the king he's a joint addressing the anointing in the king hallelujah son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and send him thou saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty we're talking about lucifer he's not ugly he's not a horned creature with a forked tail and dressed in red that's not lucifer lucifer was an angel he's a covering cherubim we're going to read a description of him and you're going to be mesmerized now you can see why john when he looked at the false church that had been built by lucifer when he looked at it he was awestruck he was astonished because it was so beautiful when you look at that false church decked in jewels and gold and and precious stones and all of these things it's a beautiful sight to behold and when he looked at the woman that was riding the scarlet cutter beast amen he was mesmerized by what he saw he was astonished at what he saw amen until the angel woke him up he said thou see us to some and perfect in beauty perfect in beauty i think that means perfect in beauty it's beautiful he was he is beautiful thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created to iniquity was found in thy and in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with the violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast this profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee that thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic there therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them that behold thee and they that now they they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore hallelujah he was created so he can be destroyed but we find out he was full of wisdom perfect in beauty all these precious stones were in him and he walked on the mountain of god amidst the fire of stones amen this is this is this is an amazing being if you would see him you would be astonished you'd be mesmerized you would be transfixed if you saw this creature amen not a hideous creature laying in a ditch half drunk and on drugs and in the house of prostitution that's not him amen that's not the image of lucifer that's not the image of the devil that's the that's the false image people would like to paint trying to get you to think that the devil is in the house of prostitution the devil is not in the house of prostitution we'll find out where he is here in a moment let's go to isaiah 14. isaiah 14 verse 12 14-12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning how art thou cut down to ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the height of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit so we find out where his desire is his desire is not to be amongst the sin and the muck of the world his desire is to sit in the congregation of the lord his desire is to rise above the stars of god he wants to he wants to rule over the seed of abraham he wants to be in the congregation of the lord on the sides of the north and that's where the lord said he would put his throne so what he's trying to do he's trying to take god's place god's not in the house of prostitution god is not down in the gutter drunk and on drugs that's not god wherever god is that's where satan's trying to be where god has established his kingdom where god has established his throne where god is dwelling in the midst of that that's the place lucifer's trying to take don't be deceived and look around at the sin and muck of the world that's just human nature in a hybrid condition allowed to go its own way with no restraints but lucifer is not working there lucifer is working wherever god is working that's where lucifer's trying to get in that's what the scriptures is telling us amen we we deceive ourselves and we become deceived with sunday school stories and images and coloring book details of the devil and all the evil things and all of that stuff oh my goodness that that's not where he's working that's not where he's spending his time that's not where he's giving his effort once he's deceived the people away from the word of god they'll run their own course amen under a hybrid condition in a fallen world he doesn't need to keep working on them to get them all the way into the house of prostitution all the way in all he's got to do is break them off the word and they'll go and they'll go according to their nature some will become drunkards some will become womanizers some will go after business and wealth some will be corrupt in politics they'll just go their own way all he's got to do is break them from the word and so what is he trying to do he's trying to take the place of god and break them off the word amen hallelujah let's go to revelations chapter 12. revelations chapter 12. verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so we find out he waged war in heaven amen he did not want to be cast out of heaven he wasn't itching to get away from heaven he wanted to rule over heaven he wanted to rule over the sons of god he wanted to be the king over all the creation he wanted to be in god's place amen that's why he become the vicar of christ because he wants to be in christ place that's why he became the antichrist spirit because anti is against or in place of end time means for anti or anti means for so it's like if i give you something in exchange for something so if i want to sell you this for a dollar you give me a dollar for this and your dollar becomes anti-controller got it it's a replacement it's in place of and that's what lucifer is trying to do he's trying to become in place of oh hallelujah it's so much closer than we've ever thought not over there and over there and over there but if you want to find out where the antichrist spirit is trying to work you look in the mirror because christ is sitting on the throne and who wants to sit on that throne none other but lucifer christ has come to the throne of my heart and lucifer wants to sit there he wants to beat him to it he wants to push him off of it amen but praise god i've been sealed with a seal that won't be broke until the day of my redemption hallelujah oh god is wonderful let's read a couple quotes here in the fourth seal prophet of god said what what is this all coming to now we've just about 12 14 minutes here i guess look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle amen there's nothing new under the sun there's nothing happened that hasn't happened before amen this battle started in heaven it spilled out into the earth and now we're coming right back to the battle again you see it in revelations 19 when christ comes on his white horse and in the heavens are open he saws him on a white horse and his name is faithful and true and all we know all the description and it says in the armies of heaven followed after him what are they doing they're coming down to destroy him in the battle of armageddon because michael defeated him in heaven cast him out of earth and now he's coming with the redeemed saints back to have a final battle with him here's what the prophet says the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to the earth then he polluted eden then he'd been polluting ever since and now the battle in heaven it's coming to the battle on earth and it's to be finished on earth at the time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrowed them just run out and when they did dropped right down into eden and here started the battle down here god had his children all fortified up in his word and eve stuck her neck out said i believe you're right maybe and there it went it's been ever since so now what you're seeing is the pattern remember when i said you find the pattern the pattern repeats and so now we find out that something goes awry in heaven and there's war and the devil and his angels they fight against michael and his angels and he's cast out and he comes down the false vine drops down into eden before the vulspine comes there's only one vine god wanted one vine he wanted an earth and inhabited by sons and daughters of god he desired one vine but now the second vine that's cast out of heaven comes down to earth two vines start in heaven two vines work through and what you're reading when you pick up your bible is you're writing a book of war the entire book is a record of this war that started in heaven spilled into eden and will wind up finally in the battle of golgan magog and you read it from genesis the revelations this is a war this is a battle this is a fight between two forces one of them is the false vine one of them is the true vine but you find where the false vine went the false vine came down and he didn't want to he didn't want to uh uh indwell the animals he didn't want to take over the serpent life what he wanted to do is he wanted to inject himself in the woman he wanted to put himself in the church he wanted to become material like god was wanting to become material and now satan can't create all he can do is pervert but he realizes what's going to take place god wants to become materialized upon the earth he wants to be a family of sons and daughters attributes of god dwelling on this earth but what is lucifer trying to do the same thing god's trying to do only he does it in a perverted way and bypasses the word amen so he comes down and deceives the woman why didn't he just deceive the serpents why did he start a serpent race of people why didn't he take over and become the lord over the serpents and wage war that's not what he wants he doesn't want the second place he doesn't want the next best thing he's trying to go where god's trying to go he's trying to dethrone god now where is god thrown today where is his dwelling place where is he trying to bring multiplication of himself at it's in the true vine in the true church where so where is lucifer working he's not working in the denominational systems he's got them bound up they're under their own mind they're going their own way he's trying he's trying to replicate himself again he's trying to do whatever god is doing hallelujah the seals is a whole lot more than just what happened way back there the seals is about what's happening today brother branham said when that white horse rider wrote amen we know that the rider changed horses back in the early church he changed from a white horse to a red horse but he said that horse rides all the way to eternity and everyone now the second horse rides he rides so you don't think that he's now only on the black horse or now only on the pale horse amen that he changes horses yes as he moves through his progression but those anointings is still here they don't change they're still here amen first thing in battle in heaven was a battle hallelujah i love it god if you find the pattern pattern repeats right so he god he said god had his children fortified behind the word what do you think they were fortified in heaven with the word lucifer whatever he did here is what he did before what he's doing now is what he's always done he's not doing anything different it's the same thing over and over and over again he deceived a third of the angels they were deceived they had the word they were living in the heavenly realms but a third of them were deceived by believing his lie and they so believed it that they would fight against michael and against the other angels whatever deception that was they fully believed it a hundred percent they believed it and what came and deceived them they lived in a helmet heavenly realm they lived in perfection amen they lived in an atmosphere of the word praise the lord what kind of deception a hideous creature with crooked teeth and and horns coming out of his head would have never touched those angels they lived in a realm of the word amen they lived in the word made material no sin had entered in yet what was it it had to be something so close so close that would deceive them in that realm hallelujah he says in christ is the mystery of god revealed now in the last days lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid church a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of born again men building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ's little bitty flock what is it that he did he did that what is it that did that fallen angels the bible said it was fallen angels who listened to lucifer instead of christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close fallen angels what kind of angels luther wesley catholic pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the angels did and has fell into them into organizations like lucifer's main hold at nicea and what have they done organized the great ecumenical association of ministers to make an image unto the beast as the bible said and building a christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like it see lucifer at his work i'm trying to bring you the threefold revelation or mystery of god so you find out i'm gonna read a little bit more in this quote but lucifer is always trying to take god's place always trying to deceive the stars of heaven amen the sons of god he's always trying and when he can't do it through his tactics his next tactic is to destroy them so if he can't deceive them he'll kill them hallelujah and you think that old spirit's dead it's still alive friends if he can't deceive them when they no longer can be deceived when they can't be tricked when he can't rule and reign in their life without them even knowing him do you think the false church knows that it's lucifer who's on the throne they have no idea they think they're worshiping god just like cain cain thought that he was worshiping god and none of his worship was received by god he had a worship that was totally in vain amen the denomination system has a worship that's totally in vain because they've left the word they if you leave one part of the word you leave all of the word when eve left one part of the word she left all of the word and they've left the word they've left it in allowing women preachers they've left it in allowing homosexuals they've left it in various ways they've left it in women cutting their hair they've left it in men's smoking and drinking and gambling they've left it in every way that you can imagine they have left the word amen so now now that he's trying to get the true church to leave the word he's trying to bring deception and when he can't do that he kills them it's been a pretty steady pattern all through the bible if you read it so now what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like eve did fallen angels did wesley was a man of god but what followed him fallen angels got into it what was the angels first creative beings of god but fell for lucifer's wisdom fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from men of god who has sent went forth to establish truths in the earth before the truth could go on and proclamate and get get onto the real revelation of christ fallen angels come in and took it over and made denominations out of him that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded do you get the reason of the seven seals being unfolded is because there's a pattern the pattern is god brings the word through a messenger amen after that satan comes right wherever god is remember he's not working somewhere else right wherever god is that's where he comes and fallen angels get in and turn him into denomination amen and it happened every age pattern follow the pattern over and over what happened in eden happened in israel what happened in israel happened in the early church and it happened all the way through same pattern never changes but now he's going to do something different amen he's going to bring back a restoration of the full word and he's going to sew open the seals so that this pattern will not repeat because there's going to be a people on the earth that finally have the final victory over lucifer and it's going to be by revelation of the mystery of the entire word they're going to understand about the battle in heaven the origination of the two vines two vines from genesis to revelation all the way to the false vine is destroyed and the battle of gog and magog never to be resurrected again there's going to be a people on earth who understand that that see his tactics know how he works they're going to withstand his every effort to overcome them amen and he's going to be so mad at them he's going to try to kill them but before he shuts her up she'll be taken up hallelujah hallelujah that's why he unfolded the mystery of the seven seals and so that there could be victory in this battle they did it because this is war this is two vines battling it out through time amen that's the reason he unfolded the mysteries is because of the battle because of the war in heaven is the reason why he unveiled the seven seal mystery oh praise god has there ever been a people on the face of the earth that's had the bible just exposed like we have we understand you grab any scripture and you enter there and once you enter there you can go anywhere in the scriptures from there why because it's one book it's talking about one thing amen it's the battle in heaven that spilled onto the earth that battle is being played out all the way till the false vine is finally defeated and what's going to defeat that false vine it's going to take those mystery truths and the seven seals that's going to give her an understanding of where she's at she's going to resist the devil she's not gonna he's not gonna have any way to stop her because if lucifer would have kept going or if if luther would have kept going he'd be here if wesley would have kept going he'd be here why the word continually unfolds under the anointing of the holy ghost and if they would have stayed on they would have went all the way to rapturing faith but what stopped them from coming to rapturing faith was the deception of the false vine so what's he trying to do now he's trying to stop you from going to rapturing faith because when you come to rapturing faith he's finished because this is war this is a battle this is not this is we're not playing games this is not playing church this is not about pretending that we're believers amen this is not by saying i'm a believer i go to a good church i'm going to be okay and i trust if i do everything right i'll come up and god will be thankful that i lived holy for him and believed his message and he's going to let me come into the kingdom there's nothing to do with that it's about war it's about war that started in heaven war came down to earth and where now we are soldiers enlisted in that battle if you read the bible the whole bible is talking about warfare even the new testament put you on the whole armor of god be thou a good soldier hallelujah this is not we're not playing church friends we're here to defeat the devil and god called you to come to this age to be in the body that you're in to be placed where you're at so that you can defeat him in every one of his the tactics you can overcome him until you can come to the place where every part of that church should have come to pentecost when it first came out if it would have stayed on it was supposed to defeat the devil and come to rapturing faith but something slipped in and sent it down the wrong path amen through the restoration they were supposed to do the same thing they were supposed to come up hold on to the word till it unveiled unveiled unveiled all the way down through till they come to rapturing faith but something crept in and deviated them off of that path but there's a prophecy that says this bride won't fall she can't be deceived why because he's unfolded the seven seal mystery he's took the veil off of the whole story and now we can see and i trust by the grace of god as we go through this our eyes will become more and more and more open till the devil has no more room to work in our lives but he'll be utterly completely defeated and we will be the people that does not get deviated from the truth we do not get sidetracked from what god has called us to but we stay true to the word and the word only and we don't deviate on one word until we go to a body change and then he's angry because when that when that new testament church resurrects and raptures he knows he's done that's what he's trying to stop he's trying to stop that at all cost he's trying to stop it in you every day he's trying to stop it in me every hour of every day he's trying to stop you from coming to rapturing faith but he don't stand a chance because there's a prophecy [Music] she will not be deceived she will not fall eve fell the hebrew church fell the the new testament church fell but this one won't fall she's predestinated not to fall why because the mystery of god is finished because he's opened the seals he's revealed the mystery of the entire book hallelujah we're not going to be deceived amen don't think it's because one big thing is because you're extra special or extra smart it's because of the word eve was indestructible behind the word she stepped from behind the word and you see how gullible she was how easily deceived how quickly she fell and how utterly she was fallen it's the difference between the word and not the word your strength doesn't come amen from might nor power but by the spirit and the spirit in the word is the self-same person hallelujah that's why the word brings the spirit to produce the word this is not legalism this is not half to this is receiving the revealed word by revelation and that word is spirit and it is life and it lives its own life it overcomes on its own but it's got to be received as truth it's got to be accepted and we've got to surrender to it completely he says again in christ is the mystery of god revealed and here is lucifer at his job again today and remember the antichrist is not communism the antichrist is so close like the real thing till of the deceived the very elective possible jesus said matthew 24 the elect if it was possible lucifer again lucifer again is breaking god's unity in man he's limiting the word of by his limiting the word of god to reasonings let's read that again lucifer again is breaking god's unity in man by his limiting the word of god to his reasonings what he thinks that's right and what he thinks he breaks the word of god hallelujah friends that's how he's breaking the unity with god and man so what brings unity with god and man it's the word and he breaks it by reasonings hallelujah brother branham says in the church age book in the chapter of the revelation of jesus christ he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now listen to this really close but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes satan revealing his works so what does the book of revelation do it exposes satan and reveals his works hallelujah that's what the book of revelation does it exposes satan and reveals his works and then in parentheses it says attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he has cast into the lake of fire so is he still doing the same thing yep he hasn't been cast in the lake of fire yet so what is what is satan's works like we said before satan's works is not the bar room it is not the drug house it is not the the casinos that is not satan's works satan's works are the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word you want to know where the devil's working that's his works that's all of his works that's a hundred percent of his works and that's always going to be his works he is attempting the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word that's what he's always done and that's what he always will do he's not doing anything else friends don't get caught up in in the in the fairy tales about the devil and lucifer and all of that he's beautiful he's full of wisdom he was a worshipping cherub he was he was a mighty mighty mighty angel and you think you can go toe-to-toe with him with reasoning the angels in heaven couldn't go toe-to-toe with him in reasoning when they lived in a glory unlike any that we've ever known they lived in a dimension that's far beyond this one in a world amen that was in perfection by the word of god how in the world do we think that we stand any match for him whatsoever it doesn't really matter what we think or what we know or any of this what matters is the word the word will always defeat him the word has always defeated him and the word always shall defeat him regardless of what we think about the word it's the word that's why he says the bride is going to have the word amen only the word not the word plus anything else but the word hallelujah right down to the time he's cast in lake of fire he hates that he cannot stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now get this he's saying the book of revelation exposes satan and his works so that book of revelation when the seals are peeled back and we begin to understand what's it revealing it's revealing his works it's revealing the way the way he works the way he attempts the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word it's in the book of revelation the book of revelation reveals and exposes him hallelujah she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her she will do what eve couldn't do because eve all she had to do was stand on the word that was given to her the revealed word for her hour and if she would stood with the revealed word for her hour satan would have never got to her and she would have never fallen and now all we have to do is stay with the revealed word for our hour and if we stay with the revealer for our hour there's no way satan can touch you you'll never be defeated and you'll never fall she will be he will sorry satan will be powerless before her why because when he come to eve as long as eve would stick with the word there was nothing he could do he could try and he could begin to talk to her again and reason with her but if she would just say what she had been heard what she had heard what she would say would have been told to her if she would just say that and nothing else there's nothing else he could do he'll walk away he could come back a week later he could try it again but if she just says what was told to her he can't do anything he can't do anything until she's willing to deviate on the word that was given to her and when she's willing to deviate on the word that was given to her then he could destroy her deceive her beguile her hallelujah i don't know about you but that makes me want to listen to the message that makes me want to pick up my bible and say god you're the author i know you i know your nature i have your nature would you open this book to me lord let me see you in the pages of this bible let me know how to defeat my enemy oh praise the lord satan will be powers before he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them hallelujah we got to quit looking in the mirror we got to quit trusting in our senses we got to quit all of this stuff and come back to faith in the word we believe it it's the word whatever it says it looks impossible it's still true it looks like it doesn't even fit it looks like it looks like it might even be wrong i believe it i don't understand it i don't have to understand it i believe it amen because faith always produces the word just taking the word and believing it not reasoning it not questioning it not trying to figure it out not reading a hundred different commentaries from the false vine you realize there's two vines two spirits [Music] two vines two spirits we have to understand that two vines two spirits and the one is the tree of good and evil and the other is the tree of life let's look at these vines you have lucifer and michael the tree of good and evil the knowledge of good and evil the tree of life you've cain and abel you have balaam and moses you have judas in jesus praise the lord these two vines were always so close judas and jesus were like that you have to recognize that judas was there through all the healing campaigns judas was shouting and singing just as loud as any other disciples shouted and saying judas was there amen judas himself cast out devils they came back from the expedition god cinema and they came back and he said and they said all of them said that they rejoiced because the devils were subject to them he said rejoice not that the devils are subject to you but rather that your names are written in heaven so judas even had his name recorded in heaven judas was a good disciple not a bad disciple a good disciple he was so good that in the last supper when jesus began to tell them that one among you is going to is going to deceive me they're going to sell me out one of you is going to betray me none of the disciples guessed judas not one of them guest judas they had all lived so close to the lord they ought to all live such a life but by the time they got here that the the the thousands had left them the hundreds had left them the 70 had left them and only the real believers were left and they're sitting in an upper room after having gone through so much judas walked so far in the word he could perform miracles he could cast out devils he could say amen to every word that jesus preached he could be right with him he slept with him talked with him ate with him fellowship with the disciples withstood persecution withstood trials amen was there when they wanted the stone jesus was there when the 70 walked away and he stayed so good was judas so close that when he said one will betray me nobody looked over at judas they all said is it i they couldn't think of anybody left in this room after all we've been through after all that's happened which one of us is it me lord that was the question that's how close this vine comes cain and abel come from the same womb they were raised as twin brothers under the same parents experiencing all the same things walking together but when it came time to take the revelation of the word they showed their colors amen so brother benham said about about judas when it came time amen when it came time to show his true colors and go up into the upper room to receive the holy ghost he showed his true colors he could come so far but couldn't go all the way we have to recognize that this antichrist spirit you're gonna say it's out there and out there and out there but he wants to be right here his desire is to be right here that antichrist spirit is coming after me and coming after you every day every single day but we have a secret the seals are open we can see him in all of his tactics here's what brother brahm said in the second seal now satan raises those up watch the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about satan he says in in the first year i'm going to jump to another quote he says in the first seal the antichrist is a smooth fella just watch how smooth he is he's smart yes sir just takes the holy spirit only thing can outdo him it's the only thing that can outdo him is the holy spirit and the second seal he says watch the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about here satan where we're unfolding him right here just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is he's right in the seals in the second seal he said look at the shrewdness of this fella where we're unfolding him right here just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is hallelujah we've got a secret friends we've seen the unfolding the stripping down and i just say if that prophet could take one of those seals and go for three months i'm saying god if this is the this is stripping down lucifer amen if this is the unfolding of the seal so that we won't repeat the same mistake so that the same pattern will be broken in this last bride she will stand she will not be deceived she will not fall she will not give up her birthrights if that is all because of the opening of the seals i say god open the seals more and more and more and more to me that i can see my position that i can find out that this isn't this isn't what i thought it was this is war this is this is a battle between christ and lucifer and i'm in the battle i'm part of the battle i'm a soldier amen and paul says no shall soldier entangle himself with the affairs of this life that he might be a good soldier and i'm saying oh that's me that's my position why am i still entangling myself with the affairs of this life i'm a soldier in this army i'm part of this battle and i've already been given the battle plan of lucifer and so now i know his secrets hallelujah oh praise god lord help us help us to see it lord help us to see it brother says in the unveiling of god in 1964 he said he said the reformer's taken on a veil until finally it come down through the lutheran age down through the other age when finally it come out and complete just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done and what's been left off that the church will be not without understanding he's he's come down here at the end a prophet arises on the scene amen to to show back here and reveal what's been done and what's been left off that the church will not be without understanding god has given it to us friends and i'm excited about it praise the lord i'm going to go through just a couple of these and i'm not going to get in i'm not going to get into these because we don't have time we're going to minister on these for the next few weeks you'll be praying about this and bring your rev bring your seals book when you come this is the black one bring your seals book when you come and we might just read passages right out of the seals book so you can mark it you can take it home and you can have it so bring your seals book and i'll call out the paragraph references when we get there so we see that this what we see in the first four seals is what we're going to spend some time talking about next week is these first four seals is a battle plan it's a battle plan of satan and it's a counter-attack or a counter-operative operation by the by christ himself so we find out that first comes a white horse we're not going to get into the white horse but brother brahm tells us it's the antichrist riding out in the first age and he begins to describe what he does and how he does it but he tells us that that in between these and now if you will take now revelations 10 1 to 7 i've been referring to remember in the last messenger's age what has to happen all of the mysteries of god would be revealed the eagle amen now you see the four beasts that rode that was perfectly right you believe that and now here's each age or each power that rode behind it and there is the scripture that shows what the enemy's writer did that's been revealed in these seals and also it's been revealed now that each beast power that god sent out to combat it hits exactly on the dot up to the eagle time look at the terminology brother branham uses the writer comes out but the beast power that god sent out to combat it amen he says in isaiah 59 19 when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of god shall lift up a standard against him so when we find out when these horse riders come down through you of white red black and and pale there's something sent to combat it there's something when the enemy comes in god raises up a standard and he does it through lion ox man and eagle and so we want to spend some time understanding what all that means not what it meant back in the church ages but what it means for me today how can i take this and overcome the devil today the fifth seal he says now as antichrist went forth on his beast of ministry there god sent forth a beast to combat it now watch and every time the beast rode on his horse the antichrist wrote on his horse on his beast to announce his ministry god sent his beast also in his own mask to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist god sent a certain type of power out to meet him and then when he went out again as a red horse another color another power another ministry god sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church sent the third one again god sent his third beast to come and announce it he sent the fourth one so we see the reason that these beasts comes it's not just interesting all this is a lion that's neat and an ox what is he doing he's raising a standard against the antichrist antichrist is coming in a certain way with a certain method with a certain approach on a certain power and there's another power that's coming from the throne of god because where do these four beasts come from these four beasts are the guards of the ark they're guards of the word amen they're guard they surround the shekinah glory of god they're around about the throne of god and these four beasts these anointings are coming from the throne of god to hold the church up to raise a standard against the antichrist spirit god has not left us to do this on his own on our own but he sent an anointing hallelujah an anointing from the throne of god so that we know that the lion was in the first age and it was sent to combat the white horse rider then we have a red horse rider and you can you can read that we'll read that next week and the ox comes to combat that now it's interesting it's interesting and i want you to start thinking on this and we're really going to dive into it next week when when the antichrist changes tactics and comes with a different beast christ changes tactics and comes with a different beast so that he's not still trying to defeat the red horse with the lion but he's coming to combat the red horse with the ox that's very interesting that when when when lucifer would move on and when he would change amen god would change i mean god's not changing but he's coming with a different anointing to combat a different power hallelujah what is this it's the battle plan it's the war he uses this weapon god's got this weapon he brings a tank god's got a tank he brings a ship god's got a ship god has a way to overcome every one of lucifer's tactics every power that he'll ride in your life every tactic or approach that he takes in your life god already has an anointing that will defeat him that will combat him that will hold the church that will stop him in your life all we have to do is realize what is his tactics what is he doing how is he working and then i can judge my life and i can find out what it is i need from god to fight the devil you don't always need the lion you don't always need the ox you don't always need you need whatever god can send from his throne to fight the devil hallelujah praise the lord then he comes on a black horse amen representing the dark ages and famine and then he combats that with a man this is an interesting one and we'll get into it more later but you know we're taught so much to rely on revelation and not intellectual understanding of the message but yet he uses a man anointing because a man he says is cunning and shrewd and sharp and he used he used that mind to defeat and he's not talking about what man has conjured up himself he's to use a man anointing to show that there's an intelligence in the word there is a revelation by the word that exposes all the trickery of the devil that there's actually a word intelligence there's a word intellect there's a word reasoning not a human reasoning not a human intellect but from the word and he types it with the man anointing and it brings spiritual and scriptural understanding and that's how they defeated and they came out of the dark ages riding against the fighting against the black horse how did they come out of that they came out of that with scriptural understanding revelation on the word amen that's what brought it back then we find out it's the pale horse which is death which is combated by the eagle somehow whenever you say ego just makes you feel good eagle yeah i don't know what it is it's the anointing that's upon us church it's what god has given us to fight back in our age when you say eagle you just know it eagle eagle he calls his children eaglets in this age because the ego can fly away in one of these days these eagles are going to fly away this is the battle plan we notice that these are not four horse riders even though we accidentally say that many times but it's one rider on four horses that's why it's the battle plan because lucifer comes in and he comes in the antichrist spirit riding on a white horse but his intention is never to stay on the white horse right he already has a goal in mind he already has a place that he wants to get to this is his plan of attack this is why when the seals unfolded it this is why he's been stripped down this is why the bride's not going to be deceived because this is his plan and method of attack he doesn't want to stay on the white horse he wants to move to the red horse but he doesn't want to ride on the red horse forever he wants to move to the black horse and after he's accomplished what he needs to accomplish in the black horse his ultimate goal has always been to move to the powerhouse and that's the way that's the battle plan of lucifer but god has a counteractive plan that'll stop him in in the defeat him the bride has a method to defeat the devil god's not stopping lucifer he's letting him ride on something happened in heaven we don't understand what it was exactly there was war something went on up there and it spilled down onto the earth and for whatever reason we don't really know why god didn't destroy lucifer when he rebelled in heaven why you can ask yourself why isn't he god can he do anything he wants i mean if i was god and he deceived a third of the angels and rebelled against me i would just smoke him and he'd be done but god works by his own laws by his own design by his own will and god has a purpose in everything he's doing and he operates according to his own word and and somehow either god couldn't or he wouldn't or he shouldn't or i don't know why but he didn't destroy lucifer when lucifer fell and now it come down to earth and the battle broke out on earth again but we find there is coming a time when god is able willing whatever he is going to ultimately destroy this false vine permanently and for whatever reason god is operating this way either by his perfect word his will for his own justice and righteousness i don't understand why but god has limited to this realm he has made it come down to this earth and all of this has to come come to pass so that he is able to be righteous and to be holy and to completely destroy lucifer if that's the plan then you and i are instrumental in the destruction of lucifer he couldn't do it then or he wouldn't do it then or for whatever reason it didn't happen then but it's going to happen now and we're soldiers in this battle god shows us in revelation 19 the raptured saints come back robed and robed in white robes riding on horses they come back to fight the battle why because they're the ones who've been fighting the battle we fight the battle here on earth amen we go on a resurrection and a rapture we come back in revelation 19 and we go to the battle of armageddon with our lord something something is depending on you and i the will of god the plan of god the righteousness of god the holiness of god it has everything to do with you and i defeating the antichrist every day it has everything to do with you and i because we've come to the full measure of the word we've come to the full stature of the bride we've come to mount zion showdown friends we've come to a critical place and we're a critical people there's no more covering for ignorance there's no more god winking his eye at the ignorance of the people that's not this day anymore we've come to full restoration of the word we've come to a full unveiling of the mysteries that are in this bible we understand now that there was war in heaven we understand now that the false vine will be terminated at the end of the book of revelations and we know that we have a position in the body of christ that we are part of the army of the lord and we know that we have something to do in this battle i tell you what that makes me that makes getting up in the morning a whole lot easier that once i realize that i'm part of this that this is hinging on my success it's hinging on me and i realize that the seals unfold the whole mystery and the seals unlock the mystery of lucifer and show me how to defeat him all of a sudden i've been reading my seal book around the clock why because i'm part of this war i'm in this army i'm in the final stages of the final battle that's going to absolutely destroy him i want to be a good soldier not one that's entangled himself with the affairs of this life but i want to be one that's focused singularly focused on the battle singularly focused on the battle plan one that's going to be overcoming by the word amen praise the lord i i'm not interested anymore in what's going to happen to me i know what's going to happen to me amen i'm going in a rapture what happens between then and now i don't know but i'm going in a rapture i'm part of that army i'm a soldier i mean i've been given the full battle armor i have the sword of the word i'm here to defeat the devil i am here amen i am here to finish off the bride age i am here to be the full measure the coming to the head of the bride i am not here to be defeated i am not here to repeat the mistakes of luther and wesley and pentecost i am here to go all the way to the finish line i am here to utterly defeat the antichrist which is the devil now tell me i'll lose my job i don't care now tell me that we're going to take your life i don't care because i know my purpose on this planet now i know i came from god i know the war started in heaven i know it's been going on for thousands and thousands of years and i know it's going to end and i know i have something to do with bringing it to an end now all of a sudden it doesn't matter to me what's happening in this life whether i have money or don't have money whether i'm sick or healthier it doesn't matter to me anymore because now i know what my purpose is i'm not afraid now of not having retirement i'm not afraid now of not having a good job i'm not afraid now of what will happen to my children there's no fear because i know my position i know my purpose i know where i came from and i know why god has me here and i know why he's unlocked the seals and i know why he sent the messenger and i know why i'm standing here in 2017 hallelujah it's because i'm part of the armies of heaven and i've come down to this earth to make my choice so brother brenham said you've come down to be tried and tested and to make your choice and somehow in making my choice you know god can't be defeated his attributes can't be lost but somehow god chose to do it this way where i would come down with no recollection of being with the father before no understanding of that other dimension just an attribute fallen into fallen humanity fallen flesh fallen spirit to where i have spiritual amnesia don't know where i came from and god chose to do it this way because the attribute which is a portion of the original the word is all that's needed to overcome the devil not your memory of your heavenly realm not your knowledge of being with the father before but what you needed was the word and the word would awaken you to all of that and start bringing back your position i was in the mind of god i was i was in the book before the foundation of the world what's happening the word is awakening the word the word is stirring the word and we're coming back out of spiritual amnesia recognizing what our purpose is on this planet it's not what i thought it was but it takes away all the anxiety about life and it brings it right back to one purpose my purpose is to defeat the devil and i've been given everything in the revelation of the word to defeat him by how many is going to fight let's all stand together god bless you my friends there's no people on the planet i'd rather be fighting with amen it's so exciting to know he's deceived generation after generation after generation those that stood and were the remnant bride that came through each church age they didn't even fully understand what was going on around them they didn't even fully comprehend what the battle was all about and who was in and who was out and what was happening to them but it's not so today because we've come down to the finish line and he's revealed it to us and now not only do we know who we are where we came from where we're going but now we know our enemy brother venom said when you're going to fight somebody you need to study them study how they fight how they take a lick how they punch what are their weak spots what are their strengths and that's what the seals have done friends it showed us the fighting tactics of lucifer and showed us what anointing from the throne were fighting i'm so excited to get into it if you'll just be praying with me next sunday we'll go a little bit farther and we'll just go and keep going and keep going as god reveals if we want to if god wants to take a month on each seals i say let's take a month brother bram said he could take three months i hope we take three months but i know there's more there for us to overcome with hallelujah god bless you if musicians want to come brother jim if you'd like to come let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord god we can't express thanks enough saying thank you is not even worthy lord of what we owe you lord what we feel towards you for god you've called us but you've not just called us you've equipped us lord to this battle lord i just pray now that you would come and you would minister to us lord help us lord to stay away from that false vine let us stay to the true pure word that you've given us in this day god give us lord of your spirit to overcome by and god i pray that you would open our eyes to things that we have missed open our eyes to the things that we have need of to overcome in this age for god we call on you lord for revelation your prophet told us you can never pray for revelation enough lord there's never we can never underestimate the need for revelation god i just say that you your prophet said that he could have went on for three months on one seal and i'm asking father that you would open that to us lord that you would open what you showed him lord what you were revealing to him and those seals i pray that you would give it to us father and you said in your scriptures lord if if an earthly dad would give good things to their child if they ask how much more our heavenly father should give to those that ask and father i'm asking that you would give us that portion that brother venom wasn't able to speak in the seals wasn't able to write down all that was revealed to him i pray that by your word that you would reveal it lord that you would give it to us lord it's laying in that message somewhere lord i pray that you'd show it to us god give us that overcoming power give us that ability withstand the devil in every one of his tactics we just yield ourselves to you and ask that you would take us lord that you would shape us into your image and use us lord for this great battle we surrender everything to you god we say we free we ask you forgive
