[1:34] and we'll see where we get to and see
[1:35] what god will do amen
[1:37] amen let's turn to john chapter 5.
[1:42] john chapter 5 and we'll start reading
[1:43] there i also want to remind everybody
[1:45] that we've got watch night service
[1:47] next or this coming monday this coming
[1:49] monday night
[1:50] so if you have a special you'd like to
[1:52] sing we still have room for some more so
[1:54] if you'd like to see
[1:55] brother mike bauer and let him know and
[1:57] he'll keep that coordinated for us
[1:58] also we're going to serve communion at
[2:00] the end of the evening
[2:02] and so just keep that in mind
[2:05] also last year last time we did the
[2:07] watch tonight what we did is we let all
[2:09] the parents
[2:09] with the little toddlers if you'd like
[2:11] to get them in bed clothes and bring
[2:13] them a blanket or a sleeping bag and a
[2:15] pillow you're more than welcome to
[2:16] we know it's hard on the little fellas
[2:18] and you might as well let them sleep and
[2:20] like we said last time we
[2:21] want to see moms and dads and
[2:22] grandparents and pillows
[2:24] and sleeping bags and pajamas but the
[2:27] little toddlers amen would be wonderful
[2:29] and then you can just carry them out to
[2:30] the car and take them home and put them
[2:31] in bed
[2:32] it'd be a long night for those guys so
[2:34] also i wanted to
[2:36] let everybody know and get you up to
[2:37] speed on sister miriam dean harp
[2:40] was it there was a prayer request the
[2:42] sunday before last about her stepfather
[2:44] amos wrestler and and brother amos
[2:48] passed away last week
[2:50] they had a memorial service on friday
[2:52] sister barbara rissler his sister
[2:54] miriam's mom
[2:55] she had been single for quite a number
[2:57] of years
[2:58] and she was actually married to amos
[3:01] wrestler's brother so if you can keep
[3:04] this straight in your head
[3:05] a long time ago she was married to
[3:07] amos's brother
[3:08] while she was still young and with young
[3:10] children she had babies and diapers at
[3:12] the time
[3:12] her husband passed away and sister
[3:14] barbara lived alone all of those years
[3:16] well her brother-in-law amos he lived
[3:19] with his wife and several years ago his
[3:21] wife passed away
[3:22] and as god would have it the two of them
[3:24] came together
[3:25] and she ended up marrying her husband's
[3:28] brother
[3:29] many many many years later 30 some years
[3:31] later
[3:32] and she only got to be with him for just
[3:34] under two years
[3:35] and so now she's alone again so i know
[3:37] that she would cover your prayers
[3:39] and i know that it'd be good if we could
[3:40] just hold her up in prayer
[3:42] they had a memorial service this past
[3:45] friday
[3:46] down in evening light and they're going
[3:48] to bring his body up this weekend
[3:50] to hershey pennsylvania for a burial
[3:52] that's where he's originally from
[3:53] from so i know the family will be out

[3:57] them

[3:59] sister barbara especially

[4:57] bring them together and there would be
[4:58] such a rejoicing lord over the life

[5:02] for you lord i pray that you would take

[6:02] praise in jesus christ's name we pray
[6:05] amen you can be seated as you're seated
[6:08] if you could turn
[6:10] to john chapter 10.
[6:14] god bless you brother larry it's good to
[6:15] have you back brother larry just made a
[6:17] trip to mississippi
[6:18] at the passing of his mom so we've been
[6:20] praying for him and we're glad he's back
[6:22] safely with us
[6:23] so continue to hold him up in prayer as
[6:25] well
[6:26] john chapter 10 verse 30
[6:31] i and my father are one
[6:35] then the jews took up stones again to
[6:37] stone him
[6:38] amen a statement that makes us rejoice
[6:41] in the day that he was there talking to
[6:43] the jews
[6:44] was a statement that made them so angry
[6:46] amen they called it so
[6:48] blasphemous they thought it was such
[6:50] heresy
[6:51] such blasphemy that they would take up
[6:53] stones to stone him
[6:54] and all he was doing was telling the
[6:56] truth
[6:58] he said i and my father are one amen
[7:02] and he was telling exactly the truth by
[7:04] the revelation that he had
[7:06] he could place himself in the scriptures
[7:08] he had he had no spiritual amnesia amen
[7:12] amen we have come into this life with a
[7:14] spiritual amnesia
[7:16] but god has sent his word and that word
[7:18] is to break that spiritual amnesia off
[7:20] of us
[7:21] so that we would realize who we really
[7:22] are where we come from
[7:24] where we're going what our purpose is
[7:26] here on this life
[7:27] you know we talked about last week
[7:29] brother branham got to the point in
[7:30] communion
[7:31] he said i realized i as i am not the
[7:33] child of charles and ella branham
[7:36] amen and it doesn't matter what names we
[7:38] read on our birth certificate
[7:40] that's a record of a natural birth amen
[7:42] but that's not our beginning amen
[7:45] our beginning was not when we were
[7:47] birthed from a human womb on this earth
[7:49] that wasn't our beginning because we
[7:51] were with him before the foundation of
[7:53] the world
[7:53] amen if not we cannot already have
[7:56] eternal life
[7:58] but that eternal life is his own life
[8:00] which was with him before the foundation
[8:02] of the world
[8:03] amen and we come into the life of
[8:04] spiritual amnesia and the word is
[8:07] breaking away that amnesia
[8:08] so we can start to see i see who i am
[8:11] amen and i'm seeing
[8:12] brother branham said this bible is a
[8:15] mirror
[8:17] a mirror a mirror amen and we've used
[8:20] that so many times amen
[8:23] so we can look into the mirror and see
[8:24] what's wrong and fix it in ourselves and
[8:26] evangelists have used that
[8:28] amen but no longer that's the way i want
[8:30] to look at this i'm looking in the
[8:31] mirror to see who i really
[8:33] am my true identity is placed right here
[8:36] in the bible
[8:37] and when it reflects back i can say hey
[8:39] there i am there in that scripture and
[8:41] i'm there in that scripture
[8:42] and i'm there i mean like we talked
[8:44] about sunday in the story of ruth amen
[8:46] the gentile woman
[8:48] who's coming back and her first husband
[8:50] is dead hey
[8:51] we're a gentile woman in that first adam
[8:53] nature has to die
[8:55] and it's dead amen and now we're going
[8:57] to be married to the kinsmen redeemer
[8:59] amen i look in there and say that's me
[9:02] that's a story about me
[9:04] right now i'm part of this story
[9:07] that's not about people amen who lived
[9:09] thousands of years ago
[9:10] that story is about the bride today
[9:13] that's about this
[9:14] this many member body going on right now
[9:18] so the word come to break our spiritual
[9:20] amnesia but jesus christ was never
[9:23] in spiritual amnesia i mean remember as
[9:26] a 12 year old boy
[9:28] he was disputing with them in the temple
[9:29] and they were astonished and they were
[9:31] amazed at the things this 12 year old
[9:33] boy was telling them
[9:34] amen and mary and joseph had taken a
[9:37] day's journey and
[9:38] they had left and three days later they
[9:40] find him they return back to jerusalem
[9:42] and they find him
[9:42] and she looks at him and she says thy
[9:45] father and i have salty with tears
[9:48] here's a 12 year old boy that does not
[9:51] have
[9:52] spiritual amnesia because she just said
[9:56] thy father
[9:56] claiming joseph as his father and joseph
[9:59] was not his father
[10:00] and here he is he corrects her but he
[10:02] corrects her from a standpoint of
[10:04] perfect vision
[10:05] he says did you not know that i must be
[10:07] about my father's
[10:09] business he knew exactly who his father
[10:12] was
[10:12] and he knew what his father's business
[10:14] was and he knew what his purpose on this
[10:16] earth was
[10:17] and here he is he's portraying the word
[10:19] as a 12 year old boy
[10:22] hallelujah so now
[10:26] he comes to the place where the the
[10:28] pharisees
[10:29] amen god
[10:34] it's always the preachers
[10:37] who are fighting jesus
[10:40] i mean it the the harlot and the
[10:43] prostitute
[10:44] and and the tax collector and the
[10:46] fishermen and they're the ones not
[10:48] having a problem
[10:49] in fact the common people heard him
[10:52] gladly
[10:53] and his popularity was so great then
[10:56] when he got on that little donkey and
[10:57] come riding into
[10:59] in jerusalem everybody the multitudes
[11:02] the masses of people
[11:04] were screaming hosanna throwing down
[11:06] palm leaves amen as he made his
[11:08] grand entrance into jerusalem so it
[11:10] wasn't the problem with the common
[11:12] people
[11:12] the problem was with the preachers and
[11:15] it was the preachers
[11:17] who got these same people who were
[11:19] shouting hosanna and throwing palm
[11:21] leaves
[11:21] they talked they got them a few days
[11:23] later they were able to convince them
[11:26] to cry out to crucify him crucify him
[11:29] crucified
[11:30] it wasn't the desire of the people it
[11:32] was the deception of the preachers
[11:36] because the people were excited about
[11:38] his ministry
[11:39] the people were excited about the gift
[11:41] that was in him
[11:43] they were shouting hosanna to the king
[11:47] and just a few days later they were
[11:49] crying crucify him
[11:52] why what changed it was the preachers
[11:58] brother branham said what got him in
[12:00] trouble was hanging around with a bunch
[12:01] of preachers
[12:04] not that we don't love preachers we love
[12:06] preachers that stay true to the word and
[12:09] don't fight against the word of god
[12:12] amen so here jesus is fighting with the
[12:15] the preachers again the ones who ought
[12:17] to know better and he says
[12:19] i and my father are one
[12:24] they should have known that to be the
[12:26] case they should have known that's what
[12:28] he would say
[12:29] when emmanuel was present when god with
[12:31] us comes
[12:32] amen they should have known that this
[12:34] child that would be born would be god in
[12:36] flesh
[12:36] amen and he said i and my father are one
[12:39] and the jews took up stones again
[12:41] to stone him so i wanted to look at this
[12:45] scripture for a minute and something
[12:46] brother branham said because
[12:47] i made the statement search the
[12:49] scriptures for in them you think you
[12:50] have eternal life
[12:51] and they are they which testify of me
[12:53] and i said you know that's a statement
[12:55] that the bride can make now
[12:57] now i believe that brian can say search
[12:58] the scriptures they are they that
[13:00] testify
[13:00] me look at esther look at ruth look at
[13:03] rebecca look at rahab look at asin now
[13:05] look i mean look at look at all of these
[13:07] characters these women down through the
[13:09] bible and what you're going to see
[13:10] is a type of the bride in every one of
[13:12] them
[13:14] amen so here
[13:17] here's what brother branham said not
[13:18] about that scripture but about this one
[13:20] i and my father were one and he says in
[13:23] the seed is not
[13:24] heir with the shock but when you come to
[13:27] say
[13:28] i and my father are one what are you
[13:31] saying
[13:32] the same thing jesus said on that day
[13:34] amen when our spiritual amnesia
[13:37] broke away to the point where you can
[13:38] say i and my father are one
[13:42] and these other things
[13:45] then the shock pulls away from it what's
[13:48] the shock
[13:49] the shock was the religious amen the
[13:51] religion the former teaching that was
[13:53] protecting the seed as it come through
[13:55] amen but when the seed finally got to
[13:57] the point where it come to maturity
[13:59] enough
[14:00] that it could say amen it could realize
[14:02] that the ministry of christ and the
[14:03] ministry of bride is the same thing
[14:06] and when they begin to realize the
[14:07] ministry of bride the mystery of christ
[14:09] is the same thing
[14:10] they begin to declare it and the shock
[14:12] begins to pull away
[14:15] and the i and my father want and these
[14:17] other things
[14:18] what other things i preached the whole
[14:20] sermon on it this year on one of these
[14:21] other things
[14:22] but like she is the only provided place
[14:24] of worship you say what do you mean she
[14:26] is
[14:26] christ is the only provided place of
[14:28] worship that's true amen
[14:30] christ is the only provided place of
[14:32] worship but where is
[14:33] christ he said in that day
[14:36] that's i in you and you and me so where
[14:39] is he
[14:40] he's in you so if you're going to be in
[14:42] the provided place of worship you have
[14:44] to be in christ
[14:44] where is christ i'm in you
[14:49] then where are you you're in christ
[14:52] and that's the provided place of worship
[14:53] so where is christ he's in you
[14:55] i'm in you you're in me
[14:59] i don't know about you but that makes it
[15:00] the same place to me
[15:05] so when you come to say i and my father
[15:07] are one and these
[15:08] other things then the shock pulls away
[15:10] from it
[15:12] hallelujah let's turn to first
[15:14] corinthians
[15:16] chapter two together
[15:28] first corinthians chapter 2
[15:33] verse 6.
[15:40] first corinthians 2 and 6
[15:44] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[15:46] that are perfect
[15:48] so this is not wisdom among them that
[15:50] are imperfect
[15:53] this is only wisdom to them that are
[15:54] perfect and perfect means complete or
[15:57] fully mature
[15:58] so this wisdom is to those who are
[16:00] perfect
[16:02] however we speak wisdom unto them that
[16:03] are perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[16:06] world
[16:06] nor of the princes of this world that
[16:08] come to naught but we speak the wisdom
[16:10] of god
[16:11] and a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[16:13] which god ordained
[16:15] before the world unto our glory
[16:18] which none of the princes of this world
[16:20] knew for had they known it they
[16:22] would not have crucified the lord of
[16:24] glory but as it is written i have not
[16:26] seen nor ear heard neither have entered
[16:28] into the heart of man
[16:29] the things which god has prepared for
[16:31] them that love him
[16:33] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[16:36] his spirit
[16:37] for the spirit searches all things yea
[16:39] the deep things of god
[16:41] so it's the spirit that's searching not
[16:43] the mind of a man
[16:45] it's not the intellect of a man that's
[16:47] searching out the things of god
[16:49] so we've started bible studies and we've
[16:51] started all kinds of commentaries on the
[16:53] scriptures and seminaries to try to
[16:55] search out the deep things of god
[16:57] but the mind of a man cannot search out
[17:00] the deep things of god
[17:01] amen it's the spirit of god that
[17:04] searches out the deep things of god
[17:07] hallelujah let's read that again but god
[17:10] hath revealed them unto us by the spirit
[17:12] revealed
[17:14] key word revealed without revelation
[17:18] you'll never get it much study cannot
[17:20] produce
[17:21] revelation they are revealed
[17:24] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[17:27] searcheth all things
[17:28] yea the deep things have gone that's why
[17:31] if you have the
[17:32] spirit of god amen the spirit of god
[17:34] loves the word
[17:36] and the spirit of god searches out the
[17:39] deep things of the word
[17:40] that's why it's a total cop-out to me
[17:42] when somebody says
[17:44] oh i never get it i'll never understand
[17:46] it i don't need to understand it i'm
[17:47] just going to say i believe it
[17:49] the spirit searches out the deep things
[17:51] it doesn't mean you have to understand
[17:53] everything
[17:54] but the spirit says i want to know amen
[17:57] i want to know my lord i want to know
[17:59] what's available amen i want to know not
[18:01] an
[18:01] intellectual but the spirit searches all
[18:04] things
[18:05] yay the deep things of god it's the
[18:08] spirit that's driving us back to the
[18:09] tapes
[18:10] the spirit that's driving us into the
[18:12] word the spirit that says
[18:13] i want to know more that was wonderful
[18:15] show me more what you showed me
[18:16] yesterday was great
[18:17] i want to see more of you
[18:21] there's none of this i don't need to
[18:23] know i'm just going to come to church
[18:24] sing a few songs
[18:25] tune out when the preacher gets too
[18:27] complicated and i'm going to walk out
[18:28] the door
[18:29] because i don't want to know the spirit
[18:31] searches out the deep
[18:33] things it doesn't mean we're always
[18:36] going to get it
[18:37] there's a lot of things we don't get but
[18:39] the spirit is searching out the deep
[18:41] things
[18:43] the mysteries what was in his mind
[18:45] brother branham come to give us
[18:47] amen the back part of god's mind what it
[18:50] laid in mystery all through the bible
[18:52] god hadn't let this out there was a
[18:53] mysterious deep
[18:55] mystery that was running through the
[18:56] whole bible amen and he come at the
[18:58] opening of the seals
[18:59] which made his bible a brand new book
[19:04] hallelujah what was it the spirit was
[19:07] longing
[19:08] amen many prophets and wise men have
[19:10] longed to see this day
[19:12] because the spirit is searching the deep
[19:15] things of god
[19:17] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[19:19] save the spirit of man which is in him
[19:21] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[19:24] but the spirit of god
[19:26] there you go the things of god knoweth
[19:29] no man
[19:31] but the spirit of god without the spirit
[19:34] it doesn't matter how many degrees you
[19:37] can tackle to the end of your name
[19:38] how how much greek or hebrew or whatever
[19:41] we can study
[19:42] you don't know nothing unless it's
[19:45] spiritually revealed
[19:47] you know greek words you know hebrew
[19:49] word you know memorization of scripture
[19:51] you know proper punctuation we know all
[19:53] of this stuff
[19:54] but that cannot bring revelation and
[19:56] without revelation there's still
[19:58] no knowing
[20:01] amen even though the things of god
[20:04] knoweth
[20:05] no man let's not contradict the
[20:08] scripture the things of god knoweth
[20:10] no man hallelujah
[20:15] but the spirit of god now we have
[20:18] received not the spirit of the world
[20:20] but the spirit which is of god that we
[20:22] might know the things that are freely
[20:25] given to us of god which things also we
[20:29] speak not in the words which man's
[20:30] wisdom teacheth
[20:31] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[20:33] comparing
[20:34] spiritual things with spiritual
[20:38] but the natural man receiveth not the
[20:40] things of the spirit of god
[20:41] for they are foolishness unto him
[20:43] neither can he know them because they
[20:45] are
[20:45] spiritually discerned but he that is
[20:48] spiritual judgeth all things
[20:50] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[20:53] who has known the mind of the lord that
[20:54] he may instruct him
[20:56] but we have the mind of christ
[21:00] amen revelation is the key
[21:03] hallelujah that's why brother graham
[21:05] said above all things pray
[21:06] for revelation and pray
[21:10] we don't strain we don't push ourselves
[21:12] into something
[21:13] amen we just we just stay in the word
[21:15] and stay in the word and pray for
[21:17] revelation
[21:18] and revelation is a funny thing and
[21:20] revelation is not the kind of thing that
[21:21] you push and push and push and push and
[21:23] push
[21:24] and you say you got it revelation is
[21:26] that kind of thing where you just feed
[21:27] and feed and feed and feed and feed and
[21:29] feed and feed
[21:30] and all of a sudden there's one little
[21:32] click bang
[21:33] amen not through straining not through
[21:35] trying amen not when you've been on your
[21:37] knees sweating and out but sometimes
[21:39] mowing the grass or driving a car
[21:41] or listening to a tape or listening to a
[21:43] preacher preach all of a sudden
[21:45] feeding feed we labor to feed we don't
[21:47] labor to understand
[21:48] we labor to feed and all sudden click
[21:51] amen
[21:51] one little click sometimes the tiniest
[21:55] little
[21:56] switch in our mind taking us from a
[21:58] natural understanding to a spiritual
[21:59] understanding then all of a sudden it's
[22:01] like the dominoes begin to fall
[22:02] click click click click click click
[22:04] click amen
[22:06] because it's given by the spirit amen
[22:09] not it's not it's not man given
[22:12] it's not understood by the intellect of
[22:14] a man but it's spiritually discerned
[22:19] so we labor to feed
[22:22] amen not to give ourselves revelation we
[22:26] labor to feed and god's the one that
[22:27] gives revelation
[22:30] hallelujah revelation is a funny thing
[22:38] let's turn to john chapter 3.
[22:44] the gospel of john chapter 3.
[22:56] that's why jesus could say father i
[22:58] thank you you've hid this from the
[23:00] eyes of the wise and the prudent
[23:04] and revealed it unto babes praise the
[23:07] lord
[23:08] i'm glad i'm not wise and prudent
[23:12] but i'm glad i'm one of his babes one of
[23:15] his children one of his offspring amen
[23:18] praise the lord john chapter 3 verse 1.
[23:22] there was a man of the pharisees named
[23:23] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[23:26] the same came to jesus by night and said
[23:28] unto him rabbi
[23:30] we know that thou art teacher come from
[23:32] god for no man can do
[23:33] these miracles that thou doest except
[23:36] god be with him
[23:37] so we know nicodemus is a ruler amongst
[23:39] the jews
[23:40] he's a pharisee we also know he's on the
[23:43] sanhedrin because then they were talking
[23:45] about
[23:45] taking counsel of what to do with jesus
[23:48] it was nicodemus who tried to stand up
[23:49] for
[23:50] him so he says that we know
[23:53] we know that thou art a man that come
[23:56] from god for no man can do these
[23:58] miracles that thou doest
[23:59] except god be with him so there is a
[24:01] knowledge that he had
[24:03] amen but he still had no revelation he
[24:06] had an understanding he could see
[24:08] that you come from god but no revelation
[24:10] and verse three says jesus answered and
[24:12] said unto him
[24:12] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[24:14] man be born again he cannot see the
[24:16] kingdom of god
[24:18] now when we start to get into the way
[24:19] that jesus has dialogue with people
[24:21] it starts to twist our minds in the knot
[24:23] because nicodemus come by night
[24:26] he came to jesus by night and said unto
[24:28] him all he said is rabbi
[24:30] we know are a teacher come from god for
[24:32] no man can do these miracles
[24:34] that thou do us except god be with him
[24:36] now nicodemus was probably expecting
[24:38] jesus to say
[24:39] thank you i appreciate that you're
[24:40] recognizing that and
[24:42] and god bless you and you've done a good
[24:44] thing for
[24:46] but jesus doesn't address anything
[24:47] nicodemus says he doesn't refer to the
[24:50] statement of nicodemus
[24:51] he goes right to the heart and he says
[24:53] jesus answered and said
[24:54] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[24:57] man be born again
[24:58] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[25:00] nicodemus saith unto him
[25:02] how can a man be born when he is old can
[25:06] he enter the second time
[25:07] into his mother's womb and be born now
[25:10] he's asking
[25:11] a very reasonable very logical question
[25:17] but jesus is not speaking reasonably and
[25:19] logically
[25:22] and he doesn't want nicodemus to think
[25:25] reasonably or logically
[25:27] he wants him to think spiritually
[25:31] there's a different spiritual reason a
[25:33] different spiritual logic
[25:35] that's totally different than that of
[25:37] man
[25:38] and nicodemus says how can this happen
[25:40] and jesus answered verily verily i say
[25:42] unto thee except a man be born of water
[25:44] and of spirit
[25:45] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[25:47] that which is born of flesh is flesh and
[25:49] that which is born of spirit is spirit
[25:52] marvel not that i said unto thee you
[25:53] must be born again
[25:55] now now we wouldn't blame nicodemus for
[25:59] marveling
[26:01] because this is a new term nicodemus had
[26:05] studied his bible
[26:06] how many years has he read the old
[26:08] testament read the law read the prophets
[26:10] read the psalms read the proverbs read
[26:13] it all and and he's never heard this
[26:15] term
[26:15] you must be born again this is new
[26:19] it's just been laid down on him and he's
[26:21] got his degrees and
[26:22] he's come up through his education he's
[26:24] on the sanhedrin he's a ruler he's not a
[26:27] rookie
[26:28] he's not a beginner and now he's like
[26:30] this is a new term
[26:32] you must be born again and jesus doesn't
[26:34] explain it
[26:35] jesus expects him to get it
[26:39] amen sometimes jesus doesn't explain
[26:42] things
[26:42] he just expects his children to get it
[26:45] and then he's not here
[26:46] to make it enticing and appealing to the
[26:48] intellect these things are spiritually
[26:51] discerned
[26:52] and given of the spirit and he's not
[26:54] here to explain it to nicodemus
[26:56] he's sitting here all he came to do the
[26:59] only thing
[26:59] jesus came to do on this earth was to
[27:02] seek and to save
[27:03] that which was lost his ministry would
[27:05] seek and save that which was lost and
[27:07] what was he doing he was throwing out
[27:08] his word
[27:09] and he was finding those that had
[27:11] spiritual discernment
[27:12] to catch what was going on and sometimes
[27:15] they couldn't intellectually
[27:16] put it together at all just like peter
[27:19] peter
[27:20] couldn't put it together amen but peter
[27:22] caught a revelation
[27:23] that didn't come from man but came from
[27:26] god the father and when he said thou art
[27:28] christ the son of the living god
[27:30] that was not discerned by the intellect
[27:32] of a man that did not
[27:34] come from reading that did not come from
[27:36] studying that was given from god himself
[27:40] because then peter was a seed
[27:44] hallelujah so god jesus wasn't here to
[27:47] explain everything
[27:48] he was here to throw out the seed amen
[27:51] and when the word connected with the
[27:52] word it would come to life
[27:55] hallelujah so he says marvel not that i
[28:00] send unto you must be born again
[28:02] now nicodemus is thinking natural
[28:06] natural jesus is speaking spiritual
[28:10] at the same exact time one is speaking
[28:12] on a totally different level
[28:13] but the hearer is hearing with a natural
[28:16] carnal reasoning and a mind of a man
[28:18] and jesus is saying you must be born
[28:20] again he's speaking about a spiritual
[28:22] birth amen when that seed inside
[28:24] comes to birth comes the life and he's
[28:26] speaking and what he's saying is exactly
[28:28] correct
[28:31] he's saying it exactly correct from a
[28:33] spiritual mind
[28:34] but the man standing there from a carnal
[28:35] mind all he's hearing
[28:37] is i've got to be born like a baby comes
[28:39] out of its mother amen he's singing
[28:41] natural completely natural and jesus is
[28:43] talking totally spiritual
[28:46] marvel not that i said unto you must be
[28:47] born again the wind bloweth where it
[28:49] listeth
[28:50] and thou hearst the sound thereof but
[28:52] can't not tell whence it cometh and
[28:54] whether it goeth
[28:55] so is everyone that is born of the
[28:57] spirit hey
[28:58] who's born in the spirit we're just like
[29:01] the wind amen
[29:02] you can you can list it you can hear it
[29:04] you can see the movement of it but you
[29:06] have no idea
[29:07] where i came from and where i'm going
[29:09] amen but that's because we're born of
[29:11] the spirit amen
[29:12] this little this little movement that
[29:14] you see in this life
[29:15] was not the beginning of me and will not
[29:18] be the end of me
[29:19] just like when the wind blows through
[29:21] the rustling in the trees
[29:22] you can see the effect of the spirit
[29:24] moving the wind moving
[29:26] but you have no idea where that wind
[29:27] came from and where that wind is going
[29:31] so is everyone that's born of the spirit
[29:33] his origin goes
[29:34] back amen into the back part of god's
[29:37] mind
[29:39] all you see is the movement before your
[29:41] eyes
[29:43] hallelujah marvel not
[29:46] because the wind listeth bloweth where
[29:49] it listeth and now
[29:50] here's the sound there and cannot tell
[29:52] whence it cometh whether it goes so is
[29:54] everyone that's born of the spirit
[29:57] nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[30:00] can these things
[30:01] be he's still thinking
[30:05] with reasoning he hasn't made the jump
[30:08] to the spiritual
[30:09] he's still looking at the three
[30:11] dimensions he's living in he's still
[30:13] looking at
[30:14] tangible matter things he can hold on to
[30:16] real wind and real birth
[30:18] amen natural in this dimension he's not
[30:20] seeing what jesus is seeing
[30:23] nicodemus answered and said to them how
[30:24] can these things be jesus answered and
[30:26] said to him are thou a master of israel
[30:29] and knoweth not these things verily
[30:32] verily i say unto thee we speak that we
[30:34] do know
[30:35] and you tested that and testified that
[30:37] we have seen
[30:38] and you receive not our witness if i've
[30:40] told you earthly
[30:42] things this whole conversation so far
[30:46] has been earthly things nicodemus mind
[30:50] is totally shot amen he is absolutely
[30:53] confused and doesn't understand what
[30:55] jesus is saying
[30:56] and jesus said if i've only begun to
[30:58] talk to you about the earthly things
[31:00] amen how are you going to understand if
[31:02] i should talk to you about spiritual
[31:04] things
[31:05] he's talking to them on the baby level
[31:07] amen on the earthly level where the
[31:09] spirit of the earth meets
[31:10] amen but he can't even take you in the
[31:12] higher heights he told us the disciples
[31:14] the same thing
[31:15] there's much more that i would have
[31:16] loved to have told you but you were not
[31:18] able to handle it
[31:19] you haven't come to maturity enough and
[31:21] then paul the apostle says to the
[31:23] same thing amen when when you should be
[31:25] eating meat you're still on milk
[31:29] these are just earthly things you must
[31:31] be born again
[31:33] hallelujah if i
[31:38] if i've told you earthly things you
[31:40] believe not how shall you believe if i
[31:41] tell you
[31:42] heavenly things and no man hath ascended
[31:45] up to heaven
[31:46] but he that come down from heaven even
[31:48] the son of man
[31:49] which is in heaven
[31:52] how's that for your carnal reasoning and
[31:54] intellect
[31:56] he just he just took nicodemus on a trip
[31:59] that nicodemus can't explain
[32:01] nicodemus doesn't understand we've got
[32:03] to be born again
[32:04] not a flesh of the spirit like the wind
[32:07] and how can these things be
[32:08] don't marvel if i've told you earthly
[32:10] things how will you understand heavenly
[32:11] things
[32:12] he said but but then he says and no man
[32:14] hath ascended up to heaven
[32:15] but he that come down from heaven
[32:19] even the son of man which is in heaven
[32:23] we talked about this last week but you
[32:25] think about nicodemus walking away and
[32:27] he said
[32:28] what did the lord tell you and he says i
[32:30] have no idea
[32:32] he said something about no man's gone to
[32:34] heaven except the one that's come down
[32:36] from heaven
[32:36] even the son of man which is in heaven
[32:39] so where is he in heaven on earth
[32:40] i don't know amen he said he come down
[32:43] but he said he's in the heavens
[32:46] hallelujah he wasn't looking for a
[32:48] carnal understanding he wasn't looking
[32:50] for somebody that'll say
[32:51] it's here and now it's over here but
[32:54] he's going to look for somebody who can
[32:55] say
[32:55] it's here and here at the same exact
[32:58] time
[33:00] amen remember when he comes to the
[33:01] apostle paul on the road to damascus and
[33:03] in the apostle paul
[33:04] he says saul saul why persecute us down
[33:06] me amen what did paul see
[33:08] paul saw a bright light he saw a light
[33:11] the pillar of fire
[33:12] and he said saul saul why persecute us
[33:14] thou me
[33:16] he said who are you lord he said i'm
[33:18] jesus whom you persecute
[33:19] okay so now we have a bright light and
[33:22] this bright light now is shining in the
[33:24] face of the apostle paul
[33:25] and jesus says it's me i'm jesus
[33:30] not the second jesus not the third jesus
[33:33] but the only
[33:34] jesus but but
[33:37] where is the body with the nail prints
[33:40] where did it go
[33:41] where is it amen see you don't have to
[33:43] see the body with nail prints to see
[33:45] jesus
[33:48] he's seeing a lie and he's saying who
[33:50] are you he's saying i'm jesus
[33:52] whom you persecute but paul wasn't
[33:54] persecuting the nail pierced body
[33:57] paul was persecuting the body of the
[33:59] church
[34:00] that was on earth amen where the holy
[34:02] ghost was dwelling
[34:03] and jesus said that's me you're
[34:06] persecuting
[34:07] so now we have jesus in the believers
[34:11] in the light and the nail pierced body
[34:14] in heaven
[34:15] all at the same time
[34:20] how many jesus is one
[34:22] [Applause]
[34:24] the bodies in heaven the pillar of fire
[34:27] so what did he do
[34:28] did he gather up all the licks of fire
[34:30] amen when he come down
[34:31] jesus come down amen on the day of
[34:33] pentecost and the pillar of fire broke
[34:35] up
[34:35] that's what brother branham says broke
[34:37] up in the individual licks of fire and
[34:39] rested on their head and this was the
[34:40] holy ghost dividing himself
[34:42] into the people is that right
[34:46] but now that same pillar of fire is
[34:49] talking to the apostle paul
[34:50] so what did he do did he go back to each
[34:52] believer and say i want that portion
[34:54] back
[34:54] i'm sorry i got a few minutes i got to
[34:56] go show myself to paul
[34:57] no the holy ghost was still in them so
[35:00] the pillar of fire was still broke up in
[35:02] them and the filler of fire was standing
[35:04] talking to paul
[35:05] at the same time
[35:09] it's time the bride of jesus christ get
[35:11] out of kindergarten
[35:12] get out of first grade quit looking at
[35:14] natural things
[35:15] and start looking with spiritual eyes
[35:18] [Applause]
[35:19] that's why we go to the baptism of jesus
[35:21] in jordan and he comes down amen
[35:23] and it begins to say the heavens open
[35:27] john says the heavens open and the
[35:28] spirit of god descending like a dove
[35:30] upon jesus
[35:31] and a voice from heaven saying this is
[35:33] my son in whom i am well pleased
[35:36] is that right the trinitarians look at
[35:39] that and say see there's three
[35:40] people there there's jesus on earth
[35:44] there's the spirit descending and
[35:46] there's the voice from heaven
[35:52] see there's three no there's one
[35:55] the entire bible tells us god is one
[35:57] there's only one person there's only one
[35:59] god
[36:00] there's only one there's not three just
[36:02] because there's a voice
[36:03] in a in a form of a dove and a body
[36:06] standing here
[36:07] does not make god three it makes god one
[36:11] who did he say jesus was emmanuel who
[36:13] was emmanuel
[36:14] god with us jesus christ
[36:18] was the pillar of fire was the
[36:22] in the body of the believers on earth
[36:24] and had the nail print
[36:25] the body the nail scarred body sitting
[36:27] up as a memorial on the throne of god
[36:30] all at the same time how many jesus
[36:33] do we believe in one
[36:38] amen we've got to have spiritual eyes
[36:41] we've got too many nicodemuses around
[36:43] who says hey
[36:44] how can these things be what do you mean
[36:46] how can they be just have spiritual eyes
[36:48] with god all things are possible
[36:52] well i've only ever known time and space
[36:54] and matter no there was a time if you
[36:56] come from god
[36:57] that you knew before time space and
[36:59] matter
[37:00] and that life that was there before time
[37:03] space and matter
[37:04] is dwelling inside of you that's what's
[37:06] been quickened the life by the word
[37:08] to break spiritual amnesia and we don't
[37:10] have to understand the bible
[37:12] by time space and matter terms we can
[37:14] understand it spiritually
[37:17] hallelujah i think sometimes we've over
[37:21] trained
[37:23] on the bible and we've over trained
[37:27] with denominational teaching tools
[37:31] we've over trained ourselves with
[37:33] denominational bible studies
[37:35] and with denominational books and
[37:36] denominational helps
[37:38] trying to understand the bible and all
[37:40] that has given us is the same knowledge
[37:42] that nicodemus had come to
[37:44] in all of his training i think what we
[37:47] need is to let the message give us our
[37:50] bible terms and our bible definitions in
[37:53] our bible training
[37:54] let it come from the message of the hour
[37:58] too many times we're worried about our
[38:00] children memorizing bible verses there's
[38:02] nothing wrong with that
[38:03] but learning amen will take bob jones
[38:05] material and do this and i've used it
[38:06] before in homeschool so i'm not
[38:08] i'm not doubting anybody but i think
[38:10] sometimes that kind of training has been
[38:12] detrimental to our understanding of the
[38:14] scriptures
[38:16] because that comes from trinitarian
[38:19] sources and from seminary source
[38:20] and we've been taught by the prophet
[38:22] over and over that that stuff is
[38:24] is no good it's not going to get us
[38:25] where we need to go all of that
[38:27] paul had all of that paul had all the
[38:29] seminary teaching
[38:31] all the books amen all the scrolls he
[38:33] had read it all he had read the
[38:34] commentaries he had been taught by
[38:36] gamalio
[38:36] he was an audience with the high priest
[38:38] and he said i counted all as
[38:40] dung he put no value
[38:44] whatsoever on that training because what
[38:47] whatever he could not figure out and
[38:49] discern on his own
[38:50] the pillar of fire meeting amen and the
[38:52] holy ghost coming inside of him
[38:54] fixed all of his misunderstandings
[38:58] then he goes to the backside of arabia
[39:01] for three and a half years
[39:02] to study out what he had got in a
[39:05] moment's time in the presence of god
[39:08] now he searched these scriptures but
[39:10] when he looked this time it all looked
[39:12] different
[39:14] he had read it and read it and read it
[39:16] but he met the pillar of fire
[39:17] and he goes into arabia for three and a
[39:19] half years and now what he's reading
[39:21] he's not reading it the same way he used
[39:23] to read it he's not reading it and say
[39:25] well gamaliel used to teach us forget
[39:27] about gamaliel what did the pillar of
[39:29] fire say
[39:30] man what does the holy ghost say
[39:34] hallelujah praise god
[39:38] we're not denominational believers we've
[39:40] been lifted out of that
[39:42] the word has been restored one was in
[39:45] the denominations partial partial
[39:47] partial partial partial
[39:49] i don't want partial i want fool what's
[39:52] coming this day
[39:52] the full word with the full revelation
[39:55] amen the message is my bible curriculum
[39:59] the message is my bible teacher the
[40:02] message has
[40:02] the correct interpretation of the word
[40:05] with divine vindication
[40:08] hallelujah praise god
[40:14] we're not we're not trying to train up
[40:17] little nicodemuses
[40:20] we're trying to find the mind of god and
[40:22] let the spirit
[40:24] spiritual discernment teach us the word
[40:28] so the apostle paul sees the
[40:32] pillar of fire and the apostle paul
[40:35] he and when you get into first
[40:37] corinthians 15 he starts saying
[40:38] you know the lord was seen by this one
[40:40] and seen by this one as seen by the
[40:42] and lastly he was seen by me
[40:45] but how did the apostle paul see him
[40:48] it was the pillar of fire it was the
[40:50] blinding light
[40:52] and when he saw that light he didn't
[40:54] know who the light was
[40:55] but the light spoke to him and he said
[40:58] who are you and the light said
[40:59] i'm jesus
[41:02] so he saw when paul gets into first
[41:06] corinthians 15
[41:07] and he says he was seen by a cephas and
[41:09] he was seen by these and he was seen by
[41:12] james
[41:12] and last he was seen by me amen he's not
[41:15] making
[41:15] any differentiation and who was seen
[41:19] it was jesus whether it was jesus
[41:22] standing there with the disciples
[41:23] saying thrust thy finger into my hand
[41:25] and thy hand and to my side
[41:27] or whether it was him speaking to mary
[41:29] and she thought he was the gardener
[41:30] and she did he was in another form or
[41:32] when he went to the 2 on the road to
[41:34] emmaus in another form
[41:35] amen it didn't matter which form he was
[41:38] saying
[41:38] he was seen of all of them and he wasn't
[41:42] referring to the nail scarred
[41:45] body he's referring to jesus christ
[41:52] so you can see jesus without seeing that
[41:54] body
[41:55] he can appear without that body
[41:58] and it can be him himself
[42:02] not the second jesus
[42:05] amen praise the lord
[42:11] hallelujah we're not trinitarians
[42:16] and we're not oneness because if you
[42:19] were one this
[42:20] brother said he said he said jesus
[42:23] he said god is not one like my finger is
[42:26] one
[42:26] right it's kind of a confusing statement
[42:29] amen until you take it
[42:31] until you take that same statement to
[42:33] the baptism
[42:34] in jordan and now you've got the flesh
[42:38] body of god which is named jesus christ
[42:40] and the spirit of god coming upon it and
[42:42] a voice from heaven saying
[42:44] now if if we were oneness we would have
[42:46] to say
[42:47] well that was just a vision or an image
[42:49] coming down because the spirit was
[42:50] already in him
[42:51] and jesus himself was projecting his
[42:53] voice like a transphiliquist
[42:54] up into heaven and speaking this is my
[42:56] son
[42:57] that would be oneness teaching or to say
[43:00] that only where the body of jesus is
[43:02] only where jesus is but when we come to
[43:04] the apostle paul
[43:05] the apostle paul sees the light amen
[43:09] we know that the nail scar body is the
[43:11] sacrifice on the throne
[43:13] but yet he says you're persecuting me
[43:15] which is a mini-membered body
[43:16] but it's still only one jesus amen but
[43:19] he doesn't have to be
[43:21] in that one body all the time he can
[43:23] come into a mini-membered body amen
[43:26] and at the same time he can show himself
[43:28] to the apostle paul
[43:30] without having to go collect all his
[43:32] pieces again
[43:34] you see this is god this is not a man
[43:38] this is not this is not somebody like
[43:40] you and i
[43:42] i can't be here and there at the same
[43:44] time in this body
[43:46] i mean he's not he's not like we are
[43:48] he's god
[43:51] and so we can't use this faculty that's
[43:53] been given to us
[43:56] to interact with this life to understand
[43:58] god
[43:59] we're going to have to see the
[44:00] scriptures the way they're
[44:02] wrote not the way we've understood them
[44:06] to be
[44:08] hallelujah let's turn to mark 16.
[44:12] look at a couple more places here mark
[44:20] 16.
[44:31] mark 16 9-13
[44:34] i don't know about you but i love it
[44:36] when brother branham comes along and the
[44:38] word comes on
[44:39] and wrecks my carnal understanding of
[44:42] the scriptures
[44:43] i love it when i come along and i read
[44:45] and i read something and i say
[44:47] you know what i've read that wrong all
[44:49] my life
[44:51] i get excited about that as long as i
[44:53] look at that and say no it can't be i
[44:54] had to have learned it right from the
[44:56] time i was
[44:56] no when a message comes along and the
[44:58] prophet uses a scripture different than
[45:00] i've used it amen and it messes up my
[45:02] understanding
[45:03] i say praise god because when i was a
[45:05] boy and i was in sunday school and i was
[45:07] in the pentecostal church and i was
[45:09] being taught
[45:09] amen i was bored all the time
[45:14] boring everything happened back then
[45:16] everything's going to happen way
[45:18] over here and i'm learning about stuff
[45:19] that happened thousands of years ago and
[45:21] i'm waiting for something that seemingly
[45:23] is never going to come
[45:24] but we talk about it every year and
[45:26] every service some day
[45:28] something's going to happen someday
[45:29] we're going to go away someday someday
[45:31] someday but now when i listen to the
[45:33] prophet the prophet saying what day
[45:36] that's this day this scripture is
[45:38] fulfilled this day
[45:39] this scripture is fulfilled this day
[45:40] this scripture is fulfilled this day and
[45:42] all of a sudden
[45:43] when it wrecks my understanding i say
[45:45] thank you god i'm living in the day
[45:47] of the fulfillment of the entire bible
[45:50] the whole thing this is an eternal word
[45:53] amen
[45:54] amen it's put in print and put on paper
[45:57] but before it was here it was in the
[45:58] mind of god and god spoke his word
[46:01] and somebody wrote it down and every
[46:03] word of god
[46:04] is eternal
[46:08] i no longer have to go through the bible
[46:11] check done check done check done check
[46:13] done check done
[46:15] it's all finished all i've got is a
[46:16] couple more scriptures
[46:20] no even the apostle paul
[46:24] he in the book of hebrews is writing to
[46:26] jews
[46:27] and he's talking about the exodus which
[46:30] for the jews is done i mean
[46:31] they come out of egypt they come to the
[46:33] promised land i mean that was done we
[46:35] studied that that was way back there
[46:37] i learned that amen when i was in my
[46:39] primer in sunday school i know the story
[46:41] moses comes out marry him dancing by the
[46:43] red sea i've got it memorized
[46:45] but paul says these things were done to
[46:48] them
[46:49] for our examples and now he's saying
[46:53] what happened in the exodus journey
[46:54] wasn't for them what happened in the
[46:56] exodus journey
[46:57] is for right now
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:02] there's no more saying well moses
[47:05] no it's all being fulfilled
[47:08] right before our eyes we're living in
[47:10] the fulfillment of the word
[47:11] the scriptures coming to life and being
[47:14] fleshed out
[47:14] amen so many scriptures it's hard to
[47:17] name them all
[47:19] brother branham preaches third exodus he
[47:22] takes the same thing
[47:23] paul paul was there in the second exodus
[47:25] establishing the people
[47:27] trying to positionally place the church
[47:29] in the land amen and so we now we have a
[47:31] first exodus and a second exodus
[47:33] according to paul
[47:34] amen but now according to the prophet
[47:36] this day there's a third exodus so the
[47:38] exodus story
[47:39] just keeps happening it keeps happening
[47:42] and keeps happening
[47:45] and then each one of us who comes to the
[47:47] lord has our own exodus story
[47:50] so we can find ourselves in the
[47:51] scripture coming out of egypt amen
[47:53] wandering in the wilderness amen going
[47:56] into the promised land
[47:57] taking our possessions so there's a
[48:01] there's a first a second a third but
[48:03] there's an individual exodus story
[48:05] taking place every time a new believer
[48:07] comes to the lord
[48:09] so these scriptures aren't to be
[48:10] pigeonholed over there or pigeonholed
[48:12] over there
[48:13] it's a living word meant to be lived and
[48:15] it's living out today
[48:19] through each one who's still coming
[48:21] still
[48:22] coming in the exodus journey
[48:28] mark 16 verse 9.
[48:32] now when jesus was risen early on the
[48:33] first day of the week
[48:35] he appeared he appeared first to mary
[48:37] magdalene
[48:38] out of whom he had cast seven devils and
[48:40] we know this is a type of the
[48:42] the last church amen because she had
[48:43] already been freed from the seven church
[48:46] ages
[48:48] and she went and told them that had been
[48:50] with them
[48:51] as they mourned and wept and they
[48:54] when they had heard that he was alive
[48:56] and had been seen after her
[48:58] believe not they heard he had been
[49:02] alive and been seen by her
[49:06] but they believe not
[49:09] after that he appeared in another form
[49:13] this is the road to emmaus he appeared
[49:15] in another form unto two of them
[49:17] and if you go to luke 24 and it says
[49:20] jesus himself
[49:21] stepped out
[49:24] but it was a another form
[49:31] and and after that he appeared in
[49:34] another form unto two of them
[49:35] as they walked and went into the country
[49:38] and they went and told it unto the
[49:39] residue
[49:40] neither believe they them
[49:44] so here you've got multiple witnesses
[49:46] that say i see them
[49:47] but they're not believing because they
[49:50] can't see
[49:53] hallelujah
[49:56] i'm gonna show you something in a minute
[49:58] let's finish this verse 14
[50:02] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[50:04] they sat at meat and unbraided them with
[50:06] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[50:08] because they believed not them which had
[50:10] seen him after he was risen
[50:13] see here jesus comes down and he begins
[50:16] to unbraid them with their unbelief and
[50:19] hardness of heart
[50:20] now you would think it would be a
[50:22] righteous thing a notable thing to take
[50:24] like thomas and said
[50:25] i'm not going to believe any stories i'm
[50:26] not going to take anybody else's
[50:28] testimony on it
[50:29] amen i i'm not going to believe until i
[50:32] see him with my own eyes and jesus was
[50:35] not pleased with that attitude he wanted
[50:40] them to believe the testimony
[50:42] because their testimony matched the
[50:44] scriptures
[50:47] that's what that's why he unbraided them
[50:49] with their unbelief
[50:50] because what they were saying was
[50:52] exactly matching the scriptures
[50:54] there's some people who won't believe
[50:56] this message unless jesus comes down
[50:58] and tells him himself they say i want
[51:00] the holy ghost to tell me
[51:01] himself he's already told you through
[51:03] the mouthpiece that's standing before
[51:05] you
[51:05] it's the scriptures made alive will you
[51:08] believe the word
[51:09] through the testimony of one of god's
[51:11] children or do you have to have him come
[51:13] down
[51:13] with a body with nail prints and tell
[51:15] you himself he will unbraid you for your
[51:18] unbelief for that
[51:20] and your hardness of heart because you
[51:23] won't believe the testimony
[51:24] of a believer you won't believe the
[51:26] testimony of a child of god
[51:28] when he is confirming to you the
[51:30] scriptures are being fulfilled
[51:33] that whole attitude i've witnessed the
[51:35] people who said i won't believe it
[51:36] unless he tells me himself
[51:38] he's telling you right now this is him
[51:41] she is him amen he is in his church
[51:44] he's telling you right now
[51:47] what more do you want
[51:51] hallelujah praise god
[51:57] so they didn't believe let's go to john
[52:00] chapter 20.
[52:10] john chapter 20.
[52:20] in verse 1 the first day of the week
[52:22] cometh mary magdalene early
[52:24] when it was yet dark unto the sepulcher
[52:26] and seeth the stone
[52:27] taken away from the sepulcher then she
[52:30] runeth and cometh to simon peter
[52:32] and to the other disciple whom jesus
[52:34] loved and saith unto them
[52:35] they have taken away the lord out of the
[52:37] sepulchre
[52:39] and we know not where they have laid him
[52:41] now this
[52:43] this disciple who whom jesus loved
[52:47] is john the beloved he's the one writing
[52:49] this gospel
[52:50] and throughout this gospel he never
[52:52] declares himself he'll talk about
[52:54] everybody else
[52:55] he either refers to himself as that
[52:56] other disciple or another
[52:58] or the one that jesus loved it's always
[53:01] referring to him
[53:02] and we know john is a type of the bride
[53:06] amen and so you know when we say search
[53:09] the scriptures
[53:10] search the scriptures and watch john
[53:12] because john's a type of the bride
[53:15] if you look at john amen especially in
[53:17] the book of john
[53:18] but but i just wrote down a few places
[53:21] john chapter 1 verse 35
[53:23] john and andrew are the first ones to
[53:26] receive
[53:27] the word from john the baptist that this
[53:29] is the lamb of god
[53:30] and when john on the second day says
[53:32] this behold the lamb of god
[53:34] amen they too left and began to follow
[53:37] him
[53:38] watch watch the bride search the
[53:40] scriptures they are they that testify
[53:42] of me amen the bride was right there
[53:44] from the beginning of the ministry of
[53:46] jesus
[53:49] hallelujah amen
[53:53] in john chapter 18 verse 15. amen we
[53:57] know that
[53:58] that the the the the temple guards they
[54:01] come to arrest jesus and everybody
[54:03] scatters
[54:04] but it's only a momentary scattering
[54:06] because one of them
[54:07] slipping behind and follow him to the
[54:10] trial
[54:11] amen at the high priest psalm and slips
[54:13] in
[54:14] and we know peter gets in but peter gets
[54:16] in because
[54:17] john was already there
[54:21] so the bride was there amen and heard
[54:24] the four runners
[54:25] the he's heard the prophet the
[54:27] forerunner elijah amen confirming that
[54:29] this is him
[54:30] and when they when when john pointed
[54:32] this as him the bride was right there
[54:34] to recognize it and even when he's
[54:37] arrested and they all scatter
[54:39] the bride is right there amen she's
[54:41] always the mysterious one not
[54:43] mentioned this is why john doesn't
[54:46] mention his name in the book of john
[54:48] he's the type of the bride he's the
[54:50] mystery it doesn't say
[54:51] john he said he whom jesus loved
[54:55] jesus loves his bride or the other
[54:59] disciple
[55:00] he slips in and he's with jesus
[55:03] through the whole trial peter's only
[55:06] there for a portion of it
[55:09] until peter denies him and runs out john
[55:12] doesn't deny him and john doesn't run
[55:14] out
[55:19] at the crucifixion all the disciples
[55:22] forsaken him but in john chapter 19
[55:24] verse 26 jesus hanging on the cross
[55:26] looks down and sees the women
[55:28] it's amazing the men are gone but the
[55:29] women are there
[55:32] and with the women is john
[55:36] and he looks down and says woman thy son
[55:41] he looks at the disciple he says thy
[55:44] mother
[55:46] who was at the crucifixion john
[55:50] see through the mystery of the bible
[55:52] whenever you see christ or a christ type
[55:54] if you look you'll see the bride right
[55:56] there amen
[55:58] the bride's always there with joseph
[56:00] there's a bride there amen
[56:02] with david there's a bride there with
[56:04] every type there's a bride there was
[56:05] solomon there's a bride there
[56:07] there's always a bride there if you just
[56:09] look
[56:10] amen and when they left the garden alone
[56:12] there was still a bride slipping in
[56:14] mysteriously amen
[56:15] at the crucifixion there was still a
[56:17] bride there
[56:20] hallelujah after his resurrection
[56:24] when he went to the sea of tiberias
[56:25] fishing they were all on the boat
[56:26] fishing
[56:27] and a mystery man stands on the bank and
[56:29] says children have you caught any fish
[56:31] and they said no it's a cast on the
[56:33] other side and they pulled in fish
[56:34] and it was the disciple whom jesus loved
[56:37] it was john
[56:38] who first said that's the lord out there
[56:41] then it was peter wrapped his fisherman
[56:42] coat and jumped in and swam after him
[56:44] but it was the bride
[56:45] who first recognized the resurrected
[56:48] lord
[56:48] in that sea of tiberia settings
[56:54] john is the last disciple to see him
[56:58] in the book of revelation
[57:02] it's john is the first to receive the
[57:04] revelation of the seven thunders
[57:07] because john's standing there and he
[57:09] hears the seven thunders utter their
[57:11] voices
[57:12] and he knows what they said it's the
[57:14] revelation of the seven seals and he
[57:16] goes to write it and he's told
[57:18] write it not so it was john amen the
[57:21] bride who received the revelation of the
[57:23] seven thunders
[57:25] and it was john in revelation 10 who
[57:27] eats the book
[57:31] and john was the only disciple who
[57:33] didn't die a martyr's death
[57:35] [Music]
[57:37] they tried to boil him in oil couldn't
[57:38] kill him they tried to kill
[57:40] but they put the fire to it they
[57:42] couldn't bully him in life they sent him
[57:43] to patmos he
[57:44] was supposed to die there he receives
[57:46] the greatest revelation
[57:47] amen the capstone of the bible then they
[57:49] bring him back out
[57:50] and he dies of natural causes as an old
[57:53] man
[57:54] showing that the bride will not go
[57:56] through the tribulation
[57:58] the only disciple amen that doesn't die
[58:01] a martyr's death
[58:02] is john the type of the bride because
[58:04] the bride is not going through the
[58:06] tribulation
[58:08] search the scriptures they are they that
[58:11] testify of this bride
[58:14] she's there she's from genesis to
[58:16] revelation if you've got eyes to see
[58:18] amen if you go back and read every
[58:20] scripture of the bible amen
[58:22] and don't see christ go back and read it
[58:23] again but you must remember
[58:25] christ like adam is in male and female
[58:30] go back and find the male we've been
[58:32] looking we've been finding him we've
[58:34] been seeing
[58:34] he's there he's there he's there he's
[58:37] there
[58:39] but go back and find the female and say
[58:41] she's there
[58:42] she's there she's the mystery that's
[58:45] been running along
[58:46] with the mystery of the man has been the
[58:48] mystery of the woman
[58:50] through the entire scriptures
[58:53] all the way through the new testament
[58:55] even john
[58:57] typing that bride now turn with me to
[59:00] john chapter 20.
[59:02] i think we already did that praise the
[59:04] lord
[59:07] mary magdalene tells them the stone is
[59:10] taken away
[59:11] then she runeth and cometh to simon
[59:13] peter and to the other disciple whom
[59:15] jesus loved
[59:16] and saith unto them they have taken away
[59:18] the lord
[59:19] out of the sepulcher we know not where
[59:21] they have laid him
[59:23] peter therefore went forth that other
[59:25] disciple
[59:26] and came to the sepulcher so they ran
[59:28] both together and the other disciple did
[59:30] outrun peter and came first to the
[59:32] sepulcher
[59:33] and he stooped down who got there first
[59:37] john hallelujah do you see a pattern
[59:43] he got down first and stooped down and
[59:45] looked in and saw the linen clothes
[59:47] lying yet when he not in
[59:49] then cometh simon peter following him
[59:51] and went into the sepulchre and seeth
[59:53] the linen clothes lie and the napkin
[59:55] that was about his head not lying with
[59:56] the linen clothes but wrapped together
[59:58] in a place by itself
[1:00:00] then went and also the other disciple
[1:00:02] john
[1:00:03] which came first to the sepulchre and he
[1:00:05] saw and
[1:00:09] believed amen
[1:00:11] if you read all the other accounts it
[1:00:13] looks like nobody believed but there was
[1:00:15] one disciple
[1:00:16] who believed from the beginning and that
[1:00:19] was john
[1:00:19] the type of the bride he looked in and
[1:00:22] he saw
[1:00:23] and believed
[1:00:27] look at the next scripture
[1:00:30] for as yet they knew not the scriptures
[1:00:34] john believed before he even knew the
[1:00:37] scriptures
[1:00:38] he didn't even need the scripture to
[1:00:40] believe something in him said
[1:00:43] i believe and they did not yet know the
[1:00:46] scriptures
[1:00:51] hallelujah they knew not the scriptures
[1:00:54] that he must rise
[1:00:56] again from the dead then the disciples
[1:00:59] went away against their own home
[1:01:01] here's john a type of the bride amen
[1:01:04] john doesn't have it all figured out
[1:01:06] john doesn't even yet know the
[1:01:07] scriptures that he must rise from the
[1:01:09] dead
[1:01:09] john hears the testimony of mary amen
[1:01:12] mary from the seven church ages
[1:01:14] because to tell him that he's
[1:01:15] resurrected that the body's gone that's
[1:01:17] all he's doing the body's gone
[1:01:18] stones roll away body's gone they run
[1:01:21] him and simon peter run
[1:01:22] he gets there first
[1:01:26] do you notice how often when jesus comes
[1:01:27] to a place he always comes to a woman
[1:01:29] first
[1:01:30] when he comes to raise lazarus comes to
[1:01:32] a woman first
[1:01:34] comes to samaria comes to a woman first
[1:01:36] huh
[1:01:37] i wonder why it's the mystery of the
[1:01:40] bride through the entire bible
[1:01:45] jesus is always coming to a woman
[1:01:50] first hallelujah
[1:01:55] so now john runs he looks down and he
[1:01:58] sees
[1:02:00] doesn't go in because the jews have to
[1:02:02] go first
[1:02:04] so simon peter runs in first
[1:02:07] he sees and he leaves then john goes in
[1:02:11] when john goes and he looks around he
[1:02:13] saw
[1:02:14] and believed
[1:02:18] that's the most exciting scripture i
[1:02:19] read in that passage
[1:02:21] because they did not yet know the
[1:02:23] scriptures that he must die and
[1:02:25] resurrect again
[1:02:28] see john doesn't need proof
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:32] because john believes when he saw the
[1:02:35] empty sepulchre
[1:02:36] not even mary believed because when we
[1:02:39] go down
[1:02:39] mary it says next next verse in verse 11
[1:02:41] but mary stood without at the sepulcher
[1:02:43] weeping
[1:02:44] and as he wept she stood down stooped
[1:02:46] down and looked into the sepulchre
[1:02:47] and seeth two angels and white sitting
[1:02:49] on the one one at the head
[1:02:51] the other at the feet where the body of
[1:02:53] jesus laying there's two angels there's
[1:02:55] two messengers at the head and feet
[1:02:56] because there's paul and brother branham
[1:02:58] at the beginning of the church ages and
[1:03:00] at the end
[1:03:02] she looks down and she sees and they say
[1:03:04] unto her woman
[1:03:05] why weepest thou she saith and then
[1:03:07] because they have taken away my lord and
[1:03:09] i know not where they have laid him
[1:03:11] and when she had thus said she turned
[1:03:13] herself back and saw jesus standing
[1:03:16] jesus which jesus
[1:03:20] which one the pillar of fire the nels
[1:03:22] guard body
[1:03:23] you know there's half a dozen of them
[1:03:27] he showed to her in one form and he was
[1:03:29] in another form to the tudor on the road
[1:03:30] to mass he was in a different form to
[1:03:32] the apostle paul
[1:03:32] and he was a different form when he came
[1:03:34] into the room and they stuck their
[1:03:35] fingers and that's four different forms
[1:03:37] of jesus if you're counting
[1:03:40] and then he was in the form that was
[1:03:41] being persecuted there's five
[1:03:44] how many jesus one jesus no matter which
[1:03:47] form he's
[1:03:48] in he says i am jesus
[1:03:53] hallelujah hallelujah don't you love it
[1:03:56] you don't have to rely on a carnal
[1:03:58] understanding
[1:03:59] or a doctrination from a denomination
[1:04:02] but you can read the bible and say
[1:04:04] that ain't nothing but the truth how
[1:04:06] does it work
[1:04:07] i don't know how it works all i know is
[1:04:08] it works and it's true
[1:04:10] and i believe it something inside of me
[1:04:12] says when paul saw that pillar fire he
[1:04:13] said i'm jesus that was jesus
[1:04:15] when he said i'm jesus you persecute in
[1:04:18] the body of those believers that was
[1:04:20] jesus too
[1:04:24] how does it work i don't know but it's
[1:04:27] the truth
[1:04:32] when she had thus said she turned
[1:04:34] herself back and saw jesus standing
[1:04:36] and knew not that it was jesus why
[1:04:39] because he was in another
[1:04:40] form if he had been standing there with
[1:04:42] his brow tore
[1:04:43] up his beard completely plucked out nail
[1:04:45] holes in his hands
[1:04:46] she would have known exactly who she was
[1:04:48] looking at
[1:04:50] you say well he was wearing a big hood
[1:04:51] and had something covering his hands
[1:04:53] please it was another form
[1:04:57] hallelujah so jesus standing knew not
[1:05:01] that it was jesus jesus said that her
[1:05:02] woman why weepest thou
[1:05:04] whom seekest thou she's supposing him to
[1:05:07] be the gardener saith unto him sir
[1:05:09] if thou have borne him hence tell me
[1:05:11] where thou's laid him
[1:05:12] and i will take him away
[1:05:15] she didn't believe what john believed
[1:05:20] john looked and believed that he was
[1:05:23] raised from the dead
[1:05:24] amen mary looked and said where is he at
[1:05:27] where's the body i'm still looking for a
[1:05:29] body
[1:05:30] and here she is still looking for a body
[1:05:34] and she's supposed to be the gardener
[1:05:35] say sir if you've borne him hence tell
[1:05:37] me where those laid him and i will take
[1:05:39] him away
[1:05:39] jesus said unto her mary
[1:05:43] the only thing he had already talked to
[1:05:45] her he already says woman
[1:05:47] why weepest thou it wasn't his voice
[1:05:50] that opened her eyes it wasn't the voice
[1:05:55] that opened the eyes it wasn't the voice
[1:05:57] of the seventh angel it wasn't the voice
[1:05:59] of the fourth beast because many people
[1:06:01] have heard that voice
[1:06:02] it wasn't the voice of the seventh angel
[1:06:04] that opened mary's eyes
[1:06:06] but it was when he called her by name
[1:06:10] and revealing the mysteries is calling
[1:06:12] the name
[1:06:14] and the only thing that can open her
[1:06:15] eyes to the one that was standing
[1:06:17] talking to her
[1:06:18] was when the mysteries was revealed her
[1:06:20] name was called
[1:06:22] and he said mary
[1:06:25] she turned herself and said to him
[1:06:27] rabboni which is the same master
[1:06:30] immediately she knew who it was when he
[1:06:31] called her name
[1:06:34] now we see the mystery laying in the
[1:06:38] bible
[1:06:39] from genesis to revelations
[1:06:44] brother branham says and events made
[1:06:46] clear by prophecy
[1:06:49] he said here's another thing they had
[1:06:50] done you know they had heard a six hour
[1:06:53] sermon on prophecy being vindicated
[1:06:55] that's what he talked to them along the
[1:06:57] road just as soon as they started down
[1:06:59] the road
[1:06:59] he stepped out for he was right there at
[1:07:01] jerusalem
[1:07:03] six hours later sixty furlongs they was
[1:07:05] right down the road six miles to emmaus
[1:07:07] and that's it and he preached confirmed
[1:07:09] prophecy for six hours
[1:07:11] so brother venom keeps highlighting that
[1:07:13] it was a six hour sermon they'd gone six
[1:07:15] miles 60 furloughs a six hour sermon in
[1:07:18] a six hour sermon
[1:07:20] he began to he he was there with his
[1:07:22] voice amen and his voice was breaking to
[1:07:25] them the word and their hearts were
[1:07:26] burning within them amen but it wasn't
[1:07:28] until they come to the seventh hour
[1:07:30] when they invited him in the house and
[1:07:32] when he come in he took the bread
[1:07:34] and he broke it and brother brahm said
[1:07:36] he did something just like he had done
[1:07:38] it before
[1:07:39] his crucifixion he showed him the sign
[1:07:43] of the son of man
[1:07:44] he had done something just like he did
[1:07:46] before and when they did
[1:07:48] their eyes were open and they saw him
[1:07:49] and they went to scream out and he
[1:07:51] vanished out of their sight
[1:07:53] then they run all the way back amen
[1:07:55] they've been traveling away from
[1:07:56] jerusalem away from the place where
[1:07:58] pentecost was going to take place
[1:08:00] moving away or way away through six
[1:08:01] church ages they come into the seventh
[1:08:03] in the seventh he comes himself and
[1:08:05] breaks bread he does something he shows
[1:08:07] the son of man ministry he shows the
[1:08:09] sign of the messiah
[1:08:10] something he had done before his
[1:08:11] crucifixion when they do their eyes are
[1:08:13] open
[1:08:14] and instantly they run back to jerusalem
[1:08:18] and they begin to tell him we have seen
[1:08:20] him
[1:08:21] not somebody like him amen not him in a
[1:08:24] way we have seen
[1:08:25] him and they didn't believe it
[1:08:31] some believe some didn't
[1:08:34] so brother branham starts showing us and
[1:08:36] how luke 24
[1:08:38] he starts taking all the types brother
[1:08:41] i'm showing us this
[1:08:42] he starts revealing modern events made
[1:08:44] clear by prophecy
[1:08:46] he starts running all the types types of
[1:08:47] moses types of noah types of all these
[1:08:50] types down through the ages and
[1:08:52] he's saying jesus must have been to this
[1:08:54] scripture and jesus must have went to
[1:08:56] this scripture
[1:08:56] and he starts showing through the word
[1:08:59] he starts to reveal
[1:09:00] all the scriptures that pertain to
[1:09:02] himself
[1:09:05] but brother branham comes in 1962
[1:09:09] he preaches a message called spoken word
[1:09:11] is the original seed
[1:09:13] and the next day he preaches a message
[1:09:14] called the end time sign seed
[1:09:16] and here's what he says he said in
[1:09:18] yesterday
[1:09:20] i preached the six hours
[1:09:23] hmm that's interesting i preached six
[1:09:27] hours upon a subject the original seed
[1:09:29] of the word
[1:09:30] and we brought it from genesis to
[1:09:33] revelations
[1:09:35] we've had the same thing in our day
[1:09:37] friends amen the same road to emmaus has
[1:09:40] taken place all over again
[1:09:42] only this time he wasn't showing about
[1:09:44] him coming as the male
[1:09:45] has the sacrifice but this time brother
[1:09:48] branham calls the spoken word is the
[1:09:49] original seed and what's he talking
[1:09:51] about
[1:09:51] and spoken word is the original seed
[1:09:53] adam had a wife
[1:09:54] just like adam had a wife she fell hey
[1:09:57] jehovah had a wife
[1:09:58] she fell but christ is going to have a
[1:10:00] wife that won't fall
[1:10:01] amen he restored what adam lost but
[1:10:03] there's coming a woman who won't fall
[1:10:05] she'll stay with the word
[1:10:06] what's he doing in the six-hour sermon
[1:10:09] he's taking us from genesis to
[1:10:10] revelations
[1:10:11] not to show us jesus christ the man but
[1:10:14] to show us
[1:10:14] mrs jesus christ the rest of the mystery
[1:10:18] that's in the bible
[1:10:22] a six hour sermon these things don't
[1:10:25] just happen
[1:10:27] i don't know how many six hour sermons
[1:10:29] you sat in probably felt like it a few
[1:10:31] sundays but
[1:10:33] we haven't done that yet
[1:10:36] six hours and we brought it from genesis
[1:10:39] to revelations
[1:10:40] back and forth on a six-hour tape that
[1:10:43] what god's program was
[1:10:45] what he is and how that spoken word of
[1:10:47] god is the seed of god
[1:10:50] friends did you hear the six hour tape
[1:10:53] did you hear the voice
[1:10:56] the better question is did he call your
[1:10:58] name
[1:11:00] did he reveal the mysteries and you saw
[1:11:04] i'm not just seeing the man that was
[1:11:05] nailed to the cross
[1:11:07] i'm seeing that he came and laid his
[1:11:09] life down so that something could be
[1:11:11] taken out of him
[1:11:13] to form another image called his bride
[1:11:16] amen and then god and the end of time is
[1:11:19] going to unite
[1:11:19] the head and the body together and it
[1:11:23] infuses invisible union
[1:11:24] and when that invisible union is
[1:11:26] complete there's going to be a
[1:11:27] manifestation
[1:11:28] amen that the headship is here in the
[1:11:31] bride
[1:11:31] and then there's going to be a change in
[1:11:33] the body amen the fullness of the
[1:11:35] rapture will come and then there's going
[1:11:37] to be a
[1:11:37] visible union in the air
[1:11:41] we've heard a six-hour tape explaining
[1:11:43] this to us
[1:11:44] not the road to emmaus amen but our road
[1:11:47] from genesis to revelation
[1:11:49] showing that all the way in the
[1:11:50] beginning there was a bride
[1:11:52] all the way the end in revelation
[1:11:54] there's a bride and there's been a
[1:11:56] mysterious bride all the way through
[1:12:00] now we've heard his voice and by
[1:12:03] revealing the mysteries
[1:12:07] we heard our name and our eyes were
[1:12:10] opened and we could say who is this
[1:12:14] who is this someone wants to say it's
[1:12:17] the coming of the holy ghost
[1:12:18] who's the holy ghost jesus christ
[1:12:21] someone to call it the coming of the
[1:12:22] word
[1:12:23] who's the word jesus christ our eyes
[1:12:25] were open where the bride could say
[1:12:27] this is jesus christ himself
[1:12:31] has come down to unite with his bride
[1:12:36] and when john looked in he believed
[1:12:42] and they didn't yet know the scriptures
[1:12:45] somehow we would listen to a tape
[1:12:49] and they hear that voice and and all of
[1:12:51] a sudden something inside of us would
[1:12:53] begin to stir
[1:12:54] and whether we liked it or not we were
[1:12:56] beginning to believe amen
[1:12:58] and if some of you were like me we were
[1:13:00] trying to choke that faith down
[1:13:01] choke that belief down because i'm not
[1:13:03] sure about this yet i can't believe till
[1:13:05] i see the prince in his nails i can't
[1:13:06] believe till he comes into my room
[1:13:08] and says chad this is me it's all
[1:13:10] correct but no matter how much i wanted
[1:13:12] that
[1:13:12] amen something inside of me kept
[1:13:14] bubbling up and saying it's the truth
[1:13:16] it's the truth
[1:13:17] it's the truth until finally i could
[1:13:21] resist it no more
[1:13:22] and i could say that's nothing but the
[1:13:24] truth
[1:13:27] and then i went to share with my friends
[1:13:29] and they said what about this scripture
[1:13:30] what about this scripture what about i
[1:13:31] said i don't know i don't know
[1:13:33] i didn't think about all of that i never
[1:13:36] thought about that scripture i
[1:13:37] i don't know i don't know how it all
[1:13:39] works
[1:13:40] but i still believe it he looked and he
[1:13:44] believed
[1:13:45] because they didn't yet know the
[1:13:46] scriptures
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:49] i talked sunday about hattie wright had
[1:13:51] he write a humble woman with a poor
[1:13:53] education amen
[1:13:54] sitting there not a bible student not a
[1:13:57] scholar she's sitting there listening to
[1:13:58] the prophet of god talk about the
[1:14:00] creation of squirrels in a voice told
[1:14:03] him
[1:14:03] you have need of something what do you
[1:14:04] need squirrels wherever they come from
[1:14:06] he describes how they're going to come
[1:14:07] and where they'll go
[1:14:08] and he's shooting them and this little
[1:14:12] woman
[1:14:12] and brother branham is referring to the
[1:14:14] scripture when he says if you say to
[1:14:16] this man
[1:14:17] so it's not like the prophet is not
[1:14:19] talking about any scriptures
[1:14:21] everything he's doing is based on the
[1:14:23] scriptures but there's no
[1:14:25] scripture that says a man in kentucky
[1:14:28] will shoot squirrels that he created
[1:14:31] you see this is the fulfillment of the
[1:14:33] scripture but the fulfillment of the
[1:14:35] scripture
[1:14:36] isn't verbatim the scripture the
[1:14:38] scripture says
[1:14:39] if you say to this mountain and doubt
[1:14:42] not in your heart
[1:14:43] it'll be plucked up and cast into the
[1:14:45] sea
[1:14:46] that's the scripture and that's the
[1:14:48] scripture brother branham was wondering
[1:14:50] about
[1:14:50] when the voice came to him and told him
[1:14:53] you have need and told him to speak the
[1:14:54] squirrels
[1:14:55] and he spoke to squirrels into existence
[1:14:57] so this is based on the scriptures
[1:14:59] but hey when you look for the scriptures
[1:15:01] to be fulfilled you have to be very
[1:15:03] careful what you're looking for
[1:15:06] because that scripture was not if this
[1:15:09] if you don't down your heart say to this
[1:15:10] mountain amen and you see an example of
[1:15:13] it when jesus speaks to the fig tree
[1:15:15] but now brother brown is coming along
[1:15:17] confirming that
[1:15:18] scripture but he's not talking to fig
[1:15:20] trees or a mountain
[1:15:23] and if you take an ecclesiastical
[1:15:25] denominational understanding of the word
[1:15:27] you'll say
[1:15:27] that can't be the fulfillment because he
[1:15:29] said mountains i didn't see a mountain
[1:15:33] hattie wright hadn't been to seminary
[1:15:35] she didn't care if it said mount or said
[1:15:37] fig tree
[1:15:38] something inside of her said that's
[1:15:40] nothing but the truth
[1:15:42] that is the fulfillment of that
[1:15:43] scripture
[1:15:47] you got to be careful the way we read
[1:15:48] the bible
[1:15:50] got to read it with spiritual
[1:15:52] discernment
[1:15:54] you got to read it with spiritual eyes
[1:15:57] not a man's
[1:15:58] intellect there's anything we can do is
[1:16:01] count all of our previous learning as
[1:16:03] dung don't rely on it don't lean on it
[1:16:07] amen
[1:16:07] all the bible school training throw it
[1:16:09] out the window
[1:16:10] all the bob jones bible verses throw it
[1:16:13] out the window and say god
[1:16:15] teach me this bible let me know what
[1:16:18] you've said
[1:16:18] let me see your word what you intended
[1:16:21] it for me
[1:16:22] not with some theologian and bob jones
[1:16:24] thought it meant i want to know what you
[1:16:26] meant by what you said
[1:16:29] amen the only way we're going to get it
[1:16:32] is through the message of the hour
[1:16:34] and spiritual discernment these things
[1:16:38] aren't naturally given
[1:16:39] they're spiritually discerned not
[1:16:42] comparing natural things was natural
[1:16:44] but spiritual was spiritual comparing
[1:16:47] natural with natural
[1:16:49] would have had if you say to this
[1:16:51] mountain
[1:16:53] okay the fulfillment will be a mountain
[1:16:56] cast into the sea
[1:16:58] no we don't compare natural with natural
[1:17:01] but spiritual
[1:17:02] with spiritual and we like hattie wright
[1:17:05] can say
[1:17:06] that's nothing but the truth we can say
[1:17:09] like john like john the beloved when he
[1:17:12] looks down and he goes on the sepulchre
[1:17:13] and he sees it all
[1:17:15] he believed even not yet knowing the
[1:17:19] scripture that he must rise again from
[1:17:20] the dead
[1:17:21] you know what the scriptures did
[1:17:23] confirmed what he believed
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:29] how many times have you read the
[1:17:31] scriptures
[1:17:32] and it confirmed what you already
[1:17:34] believed
[1:17:36] and you didn't even know it was there
[1:17:39] but you believed it not knowing it was
[1:17:41] there
[1:17:42] something the prophet would say and he
[1:17:43] wouldn't qualify a statement he would
[1:17:45] just make a statement
[1:17:46] he would say something about a bible
[1:17:47] character he'd say something about a
[1:17:49] bible story or just say something about
[1:17:50] the bible
[1:17:51] and you didn't even know it was actually
[1:17:53] written in the bible you thought it was
[1:17:54] something the prophet just said
[1:17:56] but you believed it anyhow because this
[1:17:58] is a vindicated prophet
[1:18:01] and a witness in your heart said that
[1:18:02] ain't nothing but the truth but then
[1:18:04] years later you're reading the bible
[1:18:06] and you say that's why he said that it
[1:18:08] was written in the bible but he didn't
[1:18:10] quote the bible and you didn't know it
[1:18:11] was in the bible but it didn't change
[1:18:13] anything you still
[1:18:15] believed it
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:18] and we can pretend we didn't know i only
[1:18:20] believed what i read you already
[1:18:21] believed it
[1:18:24] all that did was confirm what you
[1:18:25] believe
[1:18:27] remember when john the beloved he looked
[1:18:29] in and believed
[1:18:30] but the scripture they did not yet know
[1:18:32] the scriptures what do you think
[1:18:33] happened to john
[1:18:34] when he finally heard the scripture that
[1:18:36] he must die and raise he was like
[1:18:38] i knew it i knew it i knew it i knew it
[1:18:43] everybody else was like oh oh
[1:18:47] i denied it i didn't believe john the
[1:18:50] baptist was thrilled because it
[1:18:52] confirmed what was already his heart was
[1:18:53] already telling him
[1:18:55] that that's nothing but the truth
[1:18:58] hallelujah
[1:18:59] i don't want to be a theologian i don't
[1:19:02] want to be a seminary student
[1:19:04] i don't want to be a bible school
[1:19:05] student i want to be the living
[1:19:08] word and a living oracle
[1:19:11] living out the word so that people can
[1:19:13] see it and they look at it and say
[1:19:15] that's the truth they might not even
[1:19:18] know it comes from the bible they look
[1:19:19] at your lifestyle they look at the way
[1:19:20] you dress they look at the way you act
[1:19:22] and they know inside of them that's
[1:19:24] right they don't even know the bible but
[1:19:26] they know that's right
[1:19:29] why it's written epistles dread of all
[1:19:31] men
[1:19:32] i want this book to live in my flesh
[1:19:36] so that somebody else will look and say
[1:19:37] that's nothing but the truth
[1:19:40] i say you're right you want to see it
[1:19:42] wrote down
[1:19:45] praise god i love the word
[1:19:49] is so much more than we thought it was
[1:19:51] it's so much richer it's so much fuller
[1:19:53] it means so much to us
[1:19:57] i'll leave you with this last thought
[1:20:00] brother branham said i preached a six
[1:20:01] hour sermon
[1:20:02] right spoken word is the original seed i
[1:20:05] went back and looked it up
[1:20:06] not that i doubted him but i looked it
[1:20:08] up anyways
[1:20:09] it was 6 hours and 17
[1:20:13] minutes and we know
[1:20:16] 17 is the number of victory over defeat
[1:20:19] or a change in administration
[1:20:21] and amen it was on the 17th day that the
[1:20:24] flood broke the flood waters broke out
[1:20:25] 17th day of the second month
[1:20:27] it was the 17th day of the fifth month
[1:20:29] when the ark come to rest on ararat amen
[1:20:32] esther is the 17th book of the bible
[1:20:34] revelations 10
[1:20:35] 7 is 17.
[1:20:38] he preached a six-hour sermon six hours
[1:20:42] and
[1:20:43] 17 minutes there's no mistakes in the
[1:20:46] message friends
[1:20:48] everything's exact and it's all pointing
[1:20:50] us to the same thing
[1:20:51] 17 17 was the age of joseph when he
[1:20:54] received his coat of many colors and had
[1:20:56] his dream of ascending to the right hand
[1:20:58] of the throne
[1:21:00] 17 were 17 shekels of silver that
[1:21:02] jeremiah
[1:21:03] bought the land and redeemed the lamb
[1:21:05] for 17 seconds of silver
[1:21:07] and made the two writings and brother
[1:21:08] branham would come in the seals and
[1:21:10] then seals he said look at jeremiah look
[1:21:12] at jeremiah look at jeremiah
[1:21:17] you think this prophet's words weren't
[1:21:19] ordained
[1:21:21] his greeting in the front taking extra
[1:21:24] time it takes a long time to get started
[1:21:26] why
[1:21:26] he's got to go 6 hours and 17 minutes
[1:21:30] so that we could go back and see that 17
[1:21:32] and see revelations 10 7.
[1:21:34] see esther the 17th book of the bible
[1:21:36] see 17
[1:21:37] the silver price of redemption for the
[1:21:39] land
[1:21:40] oh friends these aren't these aren't
[1:21:43] fables cunningly devised fables of man
[1:21:46] this is god god orchestrating every word
[1:21:49] god orchestrating every step
[1:21:51] and something inside of us that can say
[1:21:53] that's the truth
[1:21:56] amen let's all stand you musicians if
[1:21:59] you'd like to come and brother jim
[1:22:01] we're a long ways from being done praise
[1:22:05] god
[1:22:06] i like this subject hallelujah
[1:22:11] yeah we'll just take watch night service
[1:22:14] sing two songs and preach five hours
[1:22:17] praise the lord you know what i love of
[1:22:20] people crazy enough to show up and say
[1:22:22] that's what we want amen
[1:22:25] hallelujah god bless you we love you all
[1:22:28] with the love of the lord so thankful
[1:22:31] for a people
[1:22:33] who don't have to see to believe
[1:22:38] thomas said unless i see i won't believe
[1:22:43] jesus said blessed is he who doesn't see
[1:22:46] amen and yet blessed is the bride like
[1:22:49] john
[1:22:50] who looks in and sees and believes
[1:22:52] before he knew the scriptures
[1:22:54] blessed is he who who doesn't see and
[1:22:57] yet believes
[1:22:59] i wasn't here for brother brennan's
[1:23:01] ministry but i believe
[1:23:03] every bit of it i wasn't here
[1:23:06] to see the pillar of fire move through
[1:23:08] the audience but i believe
[1:23:10] every word of it but i've got a
[1:23:13] different
[1:23:14] vision and that vision isn't natural
[1:23:17] eyes amen
[1:23:18] amen it's not anything that i've seen
[1:23:20] not anything i've seen in my mind's eye
[1:23:22] but by the eyes of faith i've seen the
[1:23:24] pillar of fire moving out from this
[1:23:26] pulpit tonight
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:29] and i see angels surrounding amen why
[1:23:31] because he
[1:23:32] told us that's the way it was the holy
[1:23:34] ghost in my words they are spirit
[1:23:37] and they are truth the spirit has been
[1:23:39] moving out from the pulpit over the
[1:23:41] audience because that's what the prophet
[1:23:42] told us
[1:23:44] and we've got different eyes none of us
[1:23:46] could have seen it with these eyes i
[1:23:48] didn't see a pillar of fire
[1:23:49] just like in dayton when elisha and his
[1:23:52] servant were in dathan the servant
[1:23:53] couldn't see the chariots of fire all
[1:23:55] around but they were still
[1:23:56] there
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:24:00] i can't see with these eyes amen that
[1:24:03] myth brother
[1:24:03] i'm talking about it's all become a myth
[1:24:05] a mist of faith that faith is rising
[1:24:07] amen i can't see it with these eyes but
[1:24:11] i sure enough see it with eyes down in
[1:24:12] my heart and i can say
[1:24:14] it's here amen his presence is here his
[1:24:17] pillar of fire is here
[1:24:18] his word is here he's here
[1:24:23] hallelujah blessed is he who doesn't see
[1:24:26] and believes hallelujah
[1:24:30] lean not to thine own understanding but
[1:24:32] in all thy ways acknowledge god and he
[1:24:34] shall direct thy steps
[1:24:36] by what by faith in his word
[1:24:39] i say god help me not to rely on my
[1:24:41] seeing let me not rely on my hearing
[1:24:44] but let me rely on faith
[1:24:47] faith in this word will get us from the
[1:24:49] start all the way to the finish
[1:24:53] and maybe just maybe we're going to have
[1:24:56] to really believe before
[1:24:58] we see
[1:25:01] maybe there's some things in the message
[1:25:03] maybe there's some things even out of
[1:25:04] the bible that we're really going to
[1:25:06] have to believe it
[1:25:08] just because the prophet said it
[1:25:13] even before we can find it in the bible
[1:25:17] that's been happening for the last 50
[1:25:19] years
[1:25:22] he's either a prophet of god or he's not
[1:25:27] faith has to come to a level where we're
[1:25:29] directed by faith not by knowledge
[1:25:32] faith not by intellect but by faith
[1:25:36] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:25:37] world even
[1:25:39] our faith
[1:25:43] sometimes god withholds a little seeing
[1:25:48] just to see if we've got faith
[1:25:52] he might even show you the wrong picture
[1:25:55] with the natural eyes just to see what
[1:25:58] your eyes of faith will see
[1:26:01] because the only thing that's going to
[1:26:03] make it through what's coming and the
[1:26:04] squeeze is coming on the bride
[1:26:06] the only thing will be faith
[1:26:09] all human affections will be squeezed
[1:26:12] out
[1:26:13] all human reasoning is going to be
[1:26:14] squeezed out all understanding
[1:26:17] going to be squeezed out it's going to
[1:26:18] come a time it doesn't matter if every
[1:26:20] single person in your family believes
[1:26:22] this message amen or falls away from it
[1:26:24] it's going to be a test of your faith
[1:26:29] faith is the thing that's going to win
[1:26:31] not in what we see
[1:26:32] but in what we believe hallelujah
[1:26:37] that makes us a peculiar people
[1:26:40] hallelujah let's just bow our heads and
[1:26:43] pray
[1:26:45] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
