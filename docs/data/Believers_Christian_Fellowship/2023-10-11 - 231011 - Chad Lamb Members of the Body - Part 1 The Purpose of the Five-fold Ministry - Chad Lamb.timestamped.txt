[16:21] together and made sure it all worked out
[16:23] and several of the young Brothers got

[17:00] few things um I wasn't here Sunday but I
[17:03] I was able to listen to the service on
[17:05] the way home and I thoroughly enjoyed
[17:07] the service from Sunday so thank you
[17:08] brother Gabe it was quite a blessing and
[17:11] definitely could tell it it met a need
[17:14] amen and God was doing a tremendous work
[17:16] and we thank God for that I appreciate
[17:19] God's Ministry gifts amen and the way
[17:22] God has a diversity and he's able to
[17:23] take a brother and use him to meet the
[17:26] needs of his people and so we appreciate
[17:28] that I want to say thank you for that
[17:30] brother Gabe for getting out of the way
[17:32] and getting comfortable and walking all
[17:34] over the praise God brother we love you
[17:37] amen I love God's variety you know I
[17:40] watch him do that I thought man that
[17:42] looks fun and it looks comfortable when
[17:43] everybody likes it I might try that and
[17:45] I no I probably
[17:47] won't we got to leave something for
[17:49] brother Gabe to do you know the
[17:50] different gifts have to do their own
[17:52] thing amen but praise God I just thank
[17:55] God that we have the ability to be free
[17:56] to be what we are amen not try to be
[17:59] something else amen that's wonderful
[18:01] also I wanted to say a welcome to sister
[18:03] tiaba from Germany God bless you she was
[18:06] here Sunday but I didn't get a chance to
[18:07] greet her amen she's a friend of sister
[18:10] zabella and also the Ley girls and my
[18:12] daughter Brianna they met her when they
[18:13] were in Germany this past summer invited
[18:16] her over and she came so God bless you
[18:18] it's a pleasure to have
[18:20] you amen I want to say thank you also
[18:23] for praying for our trip uh over to
[18:25] British Columbia we were there for their
[18:26] Thanksgiving weekend meetings and we
[18:28] ended up having uh a Thanksgiving
[18:31] potluck Fellowship on Friday I said
[18:34] Thank God that's my kind of party amen
[18:37] so we had a wonderful time with the
[18:39] Saints there we knew some of them got to
[18:40] see them again after several years had
[18:43] wonderful fellowship with brother Chris
[18:44] meritz the pastor there and I thoroughly
[18:47] enjoyed that and uh also the services
[18:50] were we had good feedback from the
[18:51] services I was I I was thankful that it
[18:54] was a blessing because I had no idea
[18:56] what to do I was a little bit disc
[18:58] combobulated going in and couldn't quite
[19:00] find the right angle and all of a sudden
[19:02] the last minute it all comes together
[19:04] and I just trust God Amen anden it just
[19:07] goes to show we don't have anything
[19:08] figured
[19:09] out so thank you for your prayers it's
[19:12] good to be back home also want to let
[19:14] you know that this Sunday brother Danny
[19:15] dundo from the Philippines will be here
[19:17] and he'll be ministering for a Sunday so
[19:19] he comes in Saturday night and he's just
[19:21] making a quick stop he's going to be
[19:22] here Saturday through Monday so just be
[19:25] praying for his travels
[19:29] amen also just wanted to make a comment
[19:32] as most of you probably know watched the
[19:33] news we know that Israel's at War again
[19:37] anden I just find it uh amazing how the
[19:40] pressure just keeps building I mean this
[19:43] is nothing new they've been through this
[19:44] cycle many many times but you know that
[19:47] the that that the church parallels
[19:50] Israel in many ways so if they're
[19:52] constantly Under Pressure what do you
[19:53] think we're constantly under if they're
[19:56] always at risk of bombardment of Rockets
[19:58] of of of attacks I think we're the same
[20:01] way amen the devil's constantly trying
[20:03] to find a way to disrupt the plan of God
[20:06] Amen but thanks be to God we have we
[20:09] have weapons of
[20:10] warfare amen so we've just been praying
[20:13] for the situation there and it's just
[20:15] tragic and it's hard to watch and hard
[20:17] to see and but we know it's part of the
[20:20] end time sequence and part of the end
[20:22] time cycle is something that's
[20:23] inevitable and can't be stopped the
[20:25] pressure has to build and the pressure
[20:27] has to build and until finally all the
[20:29] world gathers against Israel and we're
[20:31] watching that as it unfolds and it's
[20:34] been unfolding over the last 50 60 years
[20:36] but we're continuing to watch that and
[20:39] so we just know that our time is Drawing
[20:41] Near amen don't know how near I
[20:46] sometimes when I look at things like
[20:47] this I'm like oh I wish the prophet were
[20:49] here to tell us exactly what this meant
[20:51] because without a prophetic gift all you
[20:53] can do is guess and I I quit the
[20:55] guessing business long time ago after I
[20:57] had a 100% failure
[21:00] rate I decided to
[21:02] quit but we know it's it's it's Unique
[21:06] the timing is unique and we watch stuff
[21:08] like that happen they just finished the
[21:10] Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of
[21:12] Tabernacles is the last feast in the
[21:14] Harvest cycle it's the seventh feast and
[21:16] they after they finish the seventh Feast
[21:18] the next day was the Sabbath and on that
[21:20] Sabbath day the war broke out the attack
[21:23] happened I can't tell you exactly what
[21:26] that means but I know it's significant
[21:28] amen we know all of these things are
[21:29] significant they always go to war right
[21:31] around the feast days if you've watched
[21:33] that I mean the last time it was the yam
[21:35] kapor War so there's definitely
[21:38] something that God is doing and the war
[21:40] broke out on the 10th month in the
[21:42] seventh day so we're back to 107 again
[21:46] so we know all of these things are
[21:48] significant and we don't know how we
[21:50] can't pinpoint why we don't know all the
[21:53] details neither can we draw all the
[21:54] conclusions but we can just look and by
[21:56] the things that we know we can say
[21:58] there's a significance to this amen and
[22:01] we just want to make sure that we're
[22:03] we're praying that God will help them
[22:05] amen because God's with Israel like he's
[22:08] with us amen because he still got a work
[22:10] to do there but I say God help us to be
[22:14] vigilant to be ready amen because our
[22:18] time of pressure is coming too it's
[22:21] mounting it's building amen it may not
[22:24] be all out War but it's going to be a
[22:26] spiritual war
[22:28] and we feel it all the time but say God
[22:31] help us to be vigilant and help us to be
[22:33] ready
[22:34] amen as we look at this subject uh I
[22:37] wanted to preach a subject called
[22:39] members of his body members of his body
[22:42] and we get that from the scripture in 1
[22:44] Corinthians 12 now ye are the body of
[22:47] Christ and members in particular so not
[22:50] some future date but now we are his body
[22:53] but I am a member in particular of the
[22:55] body so the body is the whole the member
[22:58] is me so I'm part of that body and so
[23:02] the title is members of the body but the
[23:04] subtitle is the purpose of the fivefold
[23:08] ministry the purpose of the fivefold
[23:10] ministry when we were at The Retreat uh
[23:12] brother Eugene took a a minute and he
[23:15] talked to us at lunchtime talked to the
[23:17] officers and the ministers in the church
[23:19] and he mentioned something about the
[23:21] fful ministry and it really struck me
[23:23] and it opened a whole another layer for
[23:25] me and I wanted to bring this to you I
[23:27] ministered on this Sunday night this
[23:29] past Sunday night in British Columbia
[23:31] and uh I just kept dwelling on it and I
[23:33] wanted to bring it home so I can share
[23:35] with you some of the things I shared
[23:37] with them and so it'll be a little
[23:39] different of course but I just want to
[23:41] share some of these things and Christ is
[23:43] the mystery of God revealed the prophet
[23:45] said and his church stands alone she is
[23:48] not hooked with nothing but he was
[23:50] identified by God being the body that
[23:53] God dwelt in and speaking of Jesus
[23:55] Christ he he was identified by God being
[23:59] the body that God dwelt in and the
[24:01] church is identified by his body doing
[24:04] the same thing she is his body amen the
[24:08] manifested truth of his promised word
[24:10] for the last day and she and she alone
[24:13] stands by it amen that is the revelation
[24:16] of the hour amen that Christ is here
[24:19] he's present he's here in Bride form in
[24:22] the formation of his bride Amen in his
[24:24] bride body and she and she alone stands
[24:27] by it because she's the only one who
[24:29] believes
[24:30] it amen but she so believes it that she
[24:33] stands by that Revelation amen and so
[24:37] it's important that we keep this at the
[24:38] Forefront of our understanding this is
[24:40] the manifestation of this hour this is
[24:42] the revelation of this moment in time
[24:45] that we're in this is what is we've come
[24:47] to the critical uh climax of this God's
[24:50] been building a body over seven Church
[24:53] ages but now at the end time he's capped
[24:55] it off with himself and now it's the
[24:58] complete fullness of him in body The
[25:00] Head and the body has United as one and
[25:03] she is his body amen not in the building
[25:06] process amen but in the completion phase
[25:09] now and it's coming to the very final
[25:12] Climax and the message things that are
[25:14] to be he says now if we are those
[25:16] attributes of God we cannot live by
[25:18] Creeds we cannot live by
[25:20] denominationalism we must live by the
[25:22] word because the bride is part of the
[25:24] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[25:27] husband there we must be that word bride
[25:30] and what is the word bride the
[25:32] manifestation of this hour that's right
[25:34] what is the word bride the manifestation
[25:36] of this hour you can say that in Reverse
[25:38] what is the manifestation of this hour
[25:39] the word
[25:41] bride and ye are the body of Christ and
[25:45] members in particular so what am I I am
[25:48] part of the manifestation of this hour
[25:51] the manifestation of this hour has
[25:52] everything to do with me amen I'm not
[25:55] all of it but I am certainly part of it
[25:57] amen
[25:58] amen so the manifestation of this hour
[26:01] the bride not a Creed or a denomination
[26:02] but a living Oracle of God a living
[26:05] attribute of God displaying to the world
[26:08] the attributes of God in the formation
[26:10] of the Bride that's to be expressed in
[26:13] this hour that we're now living so we
[26:15] don't want to be mistaken of what hour
[26:17] we're living in or what the
[26:18] manifestation of this hour is amen
[26:21] because all of that why all of that
[26:24] Revelation deres our purpose amen it's
[26:26] not just about knowing something because
[26:29] we can know something but it's not about
[26:31] knowing something because he said it's
[26:32] the manifestation of the hour it's not
[26:34] the knowledge of the hour or those a
[26:36] knowledge it's not just the revelation
[26:38] of the hour because it also is a
[26:39] revelation but it is the manifestation
[26:41] of the hour that means that this
[26:44] knowledge this Revelation has to take on
[26:46] life it's got to be living a living
[26:48] Oracle of God so it's got to be a body a
[26:51] many membered body that is actually his
[26:54] body on Earth with the head amen connect
[26:57] ected to the body living its life
[26:59] through the members of the body that is
[27:01] the manifestation of the hour so we can
[27:04] talk about it we can even sing about it
[27:06] we can have the revelation of it but if
[27:07] it doesn't come into manifestation we've
[27:09] still missed the purpose of the
[27:13] Revelation one thing I found is is is
[27:16] you can never you can never move into a
[27:19] manifestation amen of your purpose of of
[27:22] your of your calling and if you don't
[27:24] know what your purpose is it's like
[27:27] getting being hired for a job they now
[27:28] give you they hire you now work for a
[27:30] company but they don't tell you your
[27:32] title they don't give you your job roow
[27:33] they don't tell you what the expectation
[27:35] is you just show up to work one day and
[27:37] you stand there in the middle of the
[27:39] building wondering what am I supposed to
[27:40] do I'm hired I'm part of it I have the
[27:43] Revelation but what is the purpose of
[27:45] your hire what are you supposed to be
[27:48] doing and so this revelation of this
[27:50] hour amen it brings us knowledge brings
[27:52] us Revelation but it also gives us a
[27:54] purpose and that is what we're seeking
[27:56] to fulfill in this hour is that
[28:00] purpose and Christ is revealed in his
[28:02] own word he says and he's governed the
[28:04] body all the way through then the
[28:07] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[28:09] the form of a bride that was taken out
[28:12] of his side like Adam Adams was rather
[28:15] at the beginning so now the complete
[28:18] body of
[28:20] Christ what's the complete body of
[28:22] Christ male and female United back
[28:26] together now the complete body of Christ
[28:29] is revealed how is the complete body of
[28:31] Christ revealed in the form of a bride
[28:37] amen the complete body of Christ which
[28:40] is male and female the complete Adam the
[28:43] complete body of Adam was Adam and his
[28:45] wife United back together but the
[28:47] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[28:51] the form of a bride amen that's the hour
[28:55] that we live in that's what this message
[28:57] came to declare that's what his message
[28:59] came to awaken us to and that is our
[29:02] purpose in this life is to Manifest
[29:06] this now let's go to Ephesians chapter
[29:13] 4 Ephesians chapter
[29:17] 4 and I think this evening we're just
[29:20] going to lay down this principle and
[29:22] look at this and I I don't think I'll
[29:24] get very far I think I'll pick it up
[29:26] next Wednesday Lord willing into a
[29:28] second part which is really the part I
[29:30] really want to get to but you know how
[29:32] it goes that's just the way it goes amen
[29:35] you may not know how it goes I don't
[29:37] always know how it goes but this is the
[29:38] way it goes sometimes you just get into
[29:41] something and it just keeps opening
[29:42] keeps opening you got to take one piece
[29:44] before you take the next piece and
[29:45] sometimes the piece that attracted you
[29:47] you can't even get to yet tell you that
[29:50] may not be for you but that's just for
[29:51] me that's just the way it works I've
[29:53] learned to quit trying to be something
[29:55] that I'm
[29:56] not is what I am Ephesians chapter 4
[30:00] let's begin at verse 11 because we're
[30:02] going to start talking about the purpose
[30:03] of the fivefold
[30:05] ministry it says here and he gave some
[30:08] Apostles and some prophets and some
[30:10] evangelists and some pastors and
[30:12] teachers we know that these are five
[30:15] Ministry gifts we know them as the fful
[30:17] ministry that's the term that we use and
[30:19] we've heard a lot about the fful
[30:21] ministry brother Brenham says a lot
[30:23] about it in the message um we've we've
[30:25] heard a lot about it a lot of that's
[30:27] been discussed and in the environment we
[30:29] find ourselves in in the end time when
[30:32] when there's efforts sometimes to
[30:33] minimalize the fold Ministry or even in
[30:36] some cases do away with the fivefold
[30:38] ministry and declare it unnecessary
[30:40] anymore then there's been a great
[30:41] defense rise up of the fivefold ministry
[30:44] so you keep hearing terms like we need a
[30:46] five-fold Ministry God has a five-fold
[30:48] Ministry I mean the bride has a Ministry
[30:50] his Apostles prophets evangelist
[30:51] teachers and pastors and we hear all of
[30:53] that and so we are very well-versed in
[30:56] the fact that God has a fful Ministry we
[30:58] believe that we we've repeated it we've
[31:00] talked about it we've hammered on it
[31:02] because of the because of the detraction
[31:05] from that truth amen so we've come along
[31:07] we've really reinforced that and so we
[31:09] all know there's a fful Ministry we
[31:11] probably all of us in this room can name
[31:13] all five of them because we've heard it
[31:15] so much amen and we we know that that's
[31:18] part of God's word and he's not taking
[31:19] it out and it's not diminished and it's
[31:21] not
[31:22] finished but now I want to say but what
[31:25] is the five full ministry supposed to do
[31:28] we've defended it we've know we have it
[31:30] we know it's the word of God but what's
[31:32] the purpose amen this is what I always
[31:34] come to I I I know something's true and
[31:36] I know it's right and I know it's the
[31:38] word but what's it supposed to do I
[31:40] don't know if that's just my nature I
[31:42] always want to know what's it supposed
[31:43] to do I don't know how it works I guess
[31:46] that's why I took stuff apart as a kid
[31:47] you know how does it how does it do this
[31:51] so what is the fivefold ministry
[31:52] supposed to do cuz we we know we have a
[31:54] five-fold Ministry we know it's not done
[31:56] away with we know know it's not dommin
[31:58] and we'll stand up and fight for it but
[32:01] what's the fful ministry supposed to
[32:04] accomplish let's go uh brother Frank if
[32:07] you can pull up the Whiteboard for me
[32:08] I'm going to go to that in verse 11
[32:10] we'll read again and he gave some
[32:11] Apostles and some prophets and some
[32:13] evangelist and some pastors and teachers
[32:17] for the perfecting of the Saints so now
[32:20] we're getting into the
[32:22] purpose all right now we're getting into
[32:24] the purpose for the perfecting of the
[32:26] Saints
[32:27] for the work of the ministry for the
[32:29] edifying of the body of Christ so I want
[32:33] to write this down so that we don't we
[32:35] don't lose these things the purpose of
[32:37] the fful
[32:39] ministry he
[32:41] gave
[32:50] for the
[32:54] perfecting of the
[32:56] Saints
[33:00] amen so what are we coming to church for
[33:03] what am I listening to the prophet for
[33:05] what am I listening to the tapes for for
[33:06] the perfecting of the Saints this word
[33:09] perfecting is not the same word perfect
[33:11] that we read through the rest of the
[33:12] Bible that word most of the time when
[33:15] you read the word perfect in the New
[33:16] Testament it means fully mature or
[33:18] complete or full but this word
[33:21] perfecting means
[33:23] equipping or
[33:25] Furnishing so the purpose of the
[33:27] fivefold ministry is to equip the Saints
[33:30] or to furnish the Saints to give you all
[33:32] the tools you need
[33:34] amen for the equipping or Furnishing of
[33:36] the
[33:38] Saints
[33:41] for the
[33:43] work of the
[33:48] ministry now this word ministry can mean
[33:52] uh Ministry like we normally use it
[33:53] ministering from the pull pit but really
[33:55] the word ministry actually just means
[33:57] serving amen so this is this is for the
[34:00] serving of the body the work of the
[34:02] service or the work of the
[34:04] ministry and then we get to the third
[34:06] one out of the
[34:09] scripture the
[34:14] edifying
[34:16] of the
[34:19] body of
[34:21] Christ this word edifying means to build
[34:25] or to build up so what is the purpose of
[34:28] the ministry for the equipping or
[34:30] Furnishing of the Saints the work of the
[34:34] ministry the edifying the building up of
[34:37] the body of
[34:40] Christ not so we can say we believe in
[34:43] fivefold Ministry well of course we
[34:44] believe in fivefold Ministry but are we
[34:46] getting the benefit of the fivefold
[34:48] ministry because the benefit of the fful
[34:51] ministry is not to say you know I've got
[34:53] a good pastor amen but if you're not
[34:58] equipped and if you're not being built
[35:00] up in the body of Christ so what amen so
[35:03] what we believe in a fful Ministry
[35:04] what's it supposed to do and is it
[35:06] accomplishing that in my life brother
[35:08] benam said we don't come to church to
[35:09] see our good parts we come to see our
[35:11] bad parts we come to hear the word we
[35:13] come to hear our purpose we come to get
[35:15] stuff shaved off of us we get stuff we
[35:17] come to get lined back up with the
[35:18] purpose and calling of God Amen we come
[35:21] in the fful ministry is supposed to be
[35:23] equipping the Saints amen doing the work
[35:25] of the service of the body and building
[35:27] up the body of Christ amen amen and so
[35:31] let's go to the the the next verse
[35:34] here till we all come in the unity of
[35:38] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[35:40] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[35:42] measure of the stature of the fullness
[35:45] of Christ I love this scripture because
[35:48] all of a sudden we you know when we look
[35:50] at this I've read this myself so many
[35:52] times my emphasis has always been on the
[35:54] five full ministry and and so we know
[35:57] that but now immediately he turns from
[35:59] the five Ministry gifts and he goes
[36:02] right here till till we all come into so
[36:05] now it went from the fivefold ministry
[36:07] to the body here we are this is the
[36:10] purpose till we all come to
[36:13] something Amen brother brandham says in
[36:16] putting on the whole armor of God he
[36:18] says now God fortified his army what
[36:21] with himself in the form of prophets
[36:23] Apostles teachers pastors what did he do
[36:26] what was God doing listen did you ever
[36:28] think what the offices of the church is
[36:30] it's God's dress inside dress an apostle
[36:34] a prophet a SE or foresee before Satan
[36:36] ever gets to it done told it what is it
[36:39] God dressed up in his
[36:45] church I mean this is pretty intense
[36:48] what is the five4 ministry he said it
[36:50] it's the inside dress the undergarments
[36:54] what are the undergarments the thing
[36:56] that's close closest to Christ himself
[36:58] and the first thing that begins to
[37:00] reflect him to the world is the dress
[37:02] the undergarments the inside dress amen
[37:05] God dressed up in his church these
[37:09] offices is God's dressar amen so we
[37:13] realize now we're not talking about men
[37:15] this has nothing to do with men this is
[37:18] God hiding in Behind These
[37:20] offices if it's not that then it's not
[37:23] going to serve the purpose if it's not
[37:25] that then we got off the rail somewhere
[37:27] because if it become about men and these
[37:29] are men these aren't men these are gifts
[37:32] amen the gifts happen to fall in men
[37:34] because that's where the gifts fall but
[37:36] the gifts aren't men the gifts fall in
[37:38] men the gifts are gifts uh Christ gave
[37:41] amen and it's God himself dressed up in
[37:44] his
[37:46] church these offices is God's dress wear
[37:49] when you see those offices pastors
[37:51] teachers eventers what what is that
[37:53] that's God's dress wear God's presence
[37:57] God's spirit working through
[38:01] man that's why to me the fful ministry I
[38:06] mean the the the ministry doesn't exist
[38:09] to make celebrities out of a few
[38:12] men it's not here to make message
[38:14] celebrities or message Elite amen so
[38:17] that this is my favorite Minister and
[38:20] this is the best this and this and he's
[38:22] got this
[38:25] and that's not what it's for but so many
[38:29] times it's what it becomes amen it
[38:31] becomes a platform demonstration it
[38:33] becomes a ppit show pull pit show and it
[38:36] becomes about the man amen with the gift
[38:39] instead of about God veiled behind that
[38:43] flesh ministering what's he doing he is
[38:47] equipping his Saints he's working the
[38:49] ministry through the veil of Flesh he's
[38:51] edifying the body this is a whole Act of
[38:55] God equipping serving shaping his people
[38:59] for their purpose it's not about the man
[39:01] to make the man something
[39:05] great amen so we've got to keep these
[39:07] things in check in our mind because it's
[39:09] so easy to go because you know what
[39:11] we're human beings and human beings all
[39:13] have the same fallacy am mean we all
[39:15] have the same weaknesses amen everybody
[39:17] wants a hero everybody
[39:19] wants everybody wants a great man amen I
[39:23] would have had I hey I would have loved
[39:26] the be on David's side in the Old
[39:29] Testament I would love to have David as
[39:31] my king and I'm following David and it's
[39:33] all about David and David's the great I
[39:35] would love to be
[39:36] that amen but that's not what then all
[39:40] of a sudden I miss my purpose what am I
[39:41] supposed to be doing amen I know who
[39:43] David is but who am
[39:45] I I know who the preachers are but who
[39:48] am I and I know what the preachers are
[39:49] here for but what am I here for am I
[39:51] just here to support a preacher so that
[39:53] he has a platform to preach
[39:55] from
[39:57] no really the preacher here to support
[40:00] you we got to get this right amen and
[40:04] you know God has divided his gifts amen
[40:06] God has placed him where he wants God
[40:08] calls his Minister they're not voted in
[40:10] they're they're not chosen by the church
[40:12] they're chosen by God Amen nobody has a
[40:14] say in it God does this is God's Gift
[40:17] God's choice God's placing God's
[40:19] Ministry and the best thing that a man
[40:22] can do that has this gift is to get
[40:24] himself out of the way and try to lay
[40:26] him self bear so that he doesn't ruin
[40:28] what God's trying to
[40:30] do but you realize these things go two
[40:33] ways so we have we have people who want
[40:35] a champion but we also have men who love
[40:39] Limelight and Prestige and honor and and
[40:42] listen if we think yeah yeah them over
[40:45] there and them over there we are all
[40:47] susceptible to those things we are human
[40:49] beings amen we are all of us human
[40:51] beings and we have to recognize amen
[40:53] that we keep this thing lined up the
[40:55] right way and keep our minds lined up
[40:57] the right way so that we recognize the
[40:59] word of God for what it is and we don't
[41:02] over promote amen
[41:05] overvalue or
[41:08] undervalue we can go we can say well I'm
[41:11] not going to promote a man so I'm not
[41:12] going to pay an ounce of attention to
[41:13] him or listen to anything has to say
[41:15] we're just as wrong on the right side of
[41:16] the road as we are on the left side Amen
[41:20] brother said the hardest thing God's
[41:21] ever had to do is get one human being to
[41:23] believe another one Ah that's a
[41:26] challenge amen so so it can go wrong
[41:30] both ways amen but that's why the bride
[41:32] always finds herself tiptoeing on the
[41:34] razor's Edge amen because one step this
[41:37] way I'm wrong one step this way I'm
[41:40] wrong amen this is a walk of Faith this
[41:42] is the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[41:44] we're never going to get this
[41:45] intellectually we're never going to get
[41:47] it relying on our
[41:48] Humanity because it's so dangerous
[41:52] either
[41:52] way am brother man goes on want to say
[41:57] in the message and then Jesus came he
[41:58] says and God has sent in the church five
[42:01] different gifts Apostles prophets
[42:02] teachers evangelist pastors these are
[42:05] for the perfecting of the Saints this is
[42:07] his proof his ministering Spirit to the
[42:10] church to bring the body of Christ
[42:13] together what's the purpose to bring the
[42:16] body of Christ
[42:18] together
[42:21] so
[42:25] to to
[42:28] overinflate the man is
[42:31] wrong to fail to honor the vessel the
[42:34] gifts in is
[42:39] wrong this is why it I say all the time
[42:43] religion is so
[42:45] dangerous we're it's like we are playing
[42:49] with dynamite all the time yes sir this
[42:54] word that God's given us can d destroy
[42:57] us if we go either way the wrong
[43:03] way we need to I'm so glad that God sent
[43:06] us a prophet Amen to keep us lined up
[43:08] but it's going to take the spirit of God
[43:10] or else we'll even take that Prophet the
[43:11] wrong
[43:12] way so we have to stay submitted to
[43:15] Christ and say God I mean I think it's
[43:17] good just to say all the time God I'm
[43:18] trusting you please help me I'm not
[43:21] trusting myself I'm trusting you because
[43:23] if left to myself I'll mess this thing
[43:25] up amen like every other generation has
[43:27] messed this up I'm just as much human as
[43:29] they were in the Dark Ages I'm just as
[43:31] much human as they were in Luther's day
[43:32] or and Wesley's day in Pentecostal
[43:35] Revival I'm just as I'm just as much
[43:37] susceptible to failure it is because of
[43:39] your grace amen it's because of your
[43:41] calling in my life if I ever stayed true
[43:43] it's because you decided I would stay
[43:47] true help me God so now we went
[43:52] from these five Ministry gifts falling
[43:55] into the church
[43:57] now we can we can attach those to
[43:59] individuals of course because God works
[44:01] through man God's put himself on
[44:03] partnership with man God doesn't do
[44:05] anything unless he works through man so
[44:07] this is the presence of God this is the
[44:09] spirit of God these are the gifts of God
[44:11] this is the ministry of God but it's
[44:13] coming through man but now we go quickly
[44:15] in this scripture from the man now to
[44:18] the whole
[44:20] congregation and when we go to this next
[44:23] scripture I'm going to switch the screen
[44:27] here this is
[44:33] until we
[44:35] come
[44:37] into into
[44:41] what the
[44:45] unity of the
[44:51] faith I love how it didn't say the unity
[44:55] of the doctrine
[44:59] because then we would be forcing each
[45:01] other to conform to each other's
[45:04] ideas but till we can come to the unity
[45:06] of the
[45:07] faith because you know what my
[45:10] understanding May deviate just a little
[45:12] bit from your understanding and as we're
[45:14] growing amen I can tell you this my
[45:17] understanding was not what it was a year
[45:19] ago it's not what it was 6 months ago so
[45:22] I'm so glad that a year ago I didn't
[45:23] force you to conform to my understanding
[45:25] to be right so please don't force me to
[45:29] conform to your understanding to be
[45:31] right but let's just have the unity of
[45:33] Faith let's just believe that God sent
[45:34] this message and it is the truth and his
[45:36] word is true and we're still growing in
[45:38] it amen but we all have the same goal
[45:40] the same love the same passion which is
[45:43] the message amen and we stay under the
[45:45] messenger for our age and we stay
[45:46] subjected to his word and to the offices
[45:49] God put in place and we all just grow
[45:51] together let's just come to the unity of
[45:53] that faith that we believe this message
[45:55] is absolutely sent from God that we have
[45:58] amen the perfect interpretation of the
[46:00] word with Divine Vindication that the
[46:02] Bible has been perfectly interpreted in
[46:04] this age that the seals are open amen
[46:07] that God that Christ has returned and
[46:09] that he's going to manifest himself
[46:10] through his bride in the last time
[46:12] that's the unity of the faith now my
[46:14] understanding of that is going to grow I
[46:16] I want it to grow I don't want to stop
[46:18] here I want it to grow yours is going to
[46:21] grow so let's come to the unity of the
[46:22] faith and grow amen and our
[46:25] understanding will grow amen somebody
[46:28] asked me before will we ever all agree
[46:29] on everything I have no idea I'm not
[46:32] even going to try to answer that
[46:34] question because I really don't care as
[46:37] long as you're there and I'm there at
[46:38] the end of the road I don't care if our
[46:40] understanding is exactly right let's
[46:42] just keep climbing towards the same
[46:43] thing sometimes people ask questions
[46:45] that no no human being can ever
[46:48] answer are we all going to see eye to
[46:50] eye and exactly agree by the time of the
[46:52] rapt like 30 seconds before the Rapture
[46:54] we're all going to finally click we all
[46:56] I have no idea who can answer
[47:01] that but I know this every elect
[47:04] predestinated seat is going to be
[47:05] exactly what they're supposed to be at
[47:06] the time of the translation of the body
[47:09] whatever God determined that will be
[47:11] amen we get we get so fixated on things
[47:13] let's not get fixated on them let's come
[47:15] to the unity of the faith amen we're
[47:17] pressing towards the same
[47:20] thing now look at this now to the
[47:24] knowledge
[47:29] this is
[47:32] understanding of the Son of
[47:37] God God wants to share himself with us
[47:43] he wants to be understood he wants to be
[47:44] known he wants to reveal himself to us
[47:48] this is not theology this is
[47:52] relationship he wants us to come into a
[47:55] deeper Rel relationship he wants us to
[47:56] come into Fellowship so he's going to
[47:58] use the fivefold ministry Amen to bring
[48:02] us into the unity of the faith and to
[48:04] bring us into the knowledge of the Son
[48:05] of God because he is standing behind the
[48:08] veil constantly unveiling himself so we
[48:12] constantly know more about him more of
[48:14] what he likes more of what he's like
[48:16] more of what he's done and more of why
[48:17] he's done it so that we can move into a
[48:19] closer
[48:21] relationship then it
[48:24] says unto a perfect
[48:28] man this word perfect is the one that we
[48:31] normally use for fully mature or
[48:34] complete or full to a full
[48:37] man and then that we come to the
[48:46] stature of the
[48:50] fullness of
[48:53] Christ I'm going to put it like this
[48:57] the
[48:59] stature of a perfect
[49:06] man what is the fful ministry supposed
[49:09] to do bring us all into the stature of a
[49:13] perfect man bring us into
[49:16] adoption bring us into the to where the
[49:20] son now reflects the father now he's
[49:22] living just like the father remember
[49:24] when brother Brandon preached
[49:26] adoption and brother B was he was
[49:28] dramatizing and he's saying you God
[49:30] gives the best tutor he can give and
[49:32] it's the Holy Ghost and and can you
[49:34] imagine the tutor coming to the father
[49:36] and he's saying you know this is not a
[49:38] very good son he's not listening he's
[49:39] not that but he said then there's the
[49:40] other side there's a good son and he
[49:42] comes to them and he comes to the father
[49:44] he said how he would love to give the
[49:46] report and he says father he says he
[49:50] handles the Sheep just like you
[49:54] do
[49:56] you should have seen him the other day
[49:57] handle this and said it was just like
[49:59] you
[50:01] do what's taking place in
[50:03] adoption in adoption you have a son born
[50:06] from a father this father now has shared
[50:09] his genetics with this son this son now
[50:12] is made in the image of the father amen
[50:14] and so now the father has turned him
[50:16] over to a tutor to raise him up to raise
[50:19] him up to be like what to raise him up
[50:21] to be a reflection of the father because
[50:23] the tutor says he did it just like you
[50:26] do it amen because why he's going to
[50:28] turn the farm The Inheritance the
[50:30] business over to the son and he wants
[50:32] the son to be able to run it just like
[50:35] he runs it so the purpose of the tutor
[50:37] the Holy Ghost amen is to bring the son
[50:40] to bring all those genetics out of the
[50:43] Sun so the Sun starts reflecting the
[50:46] father amen he did it just like you why
[50:49] did he do it just like you because he's
[50:51] got your temperament he's got your
[50:52] nature he's got your seed inside of him
[50:55] amen and now the tutor is here to bring
[50:57] us into the reflection of Jesus Christ
[50:59] because his life is on the inside of us
[51:01] and the tutor is bringing us Amen to to
[51:04] do what amen they he he took that
[51:06] rejection just like you take it just
[51:09] like you did when you were going to
[51:11] Calvary just like when you were here
[51:12] amen Walking By the Sea of Galilee and
[51:15] they and they they mocked you and they
[51:16] ridiculed you and they called you a
[51:18] devil amen and you didn't react amen
[51:20] look he just did it just like you did it
[51:24] there GL to
[51:27] God this is
[51:29] adoption what's the fful ministry to do
[51:32] to help us to come into the statue of
[51:34] it's the Holy Ghost the tutor it's the
[51:36] Holy Ghost the tutor how's he speaking
[51:39] he's clothed in a five-fold
[51:43] Ministry
[51:45] amen let's read the next
[51:48] verse that we henceforth be no more
[51:52] children this is
[51:54] immature talk lost to and fro and
[51:56] carried about with every wind of
[51:58] Doctrine by the slight of men and the
[52:01] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[52:03] wait to
[52:05] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[52:07] may grow up into him in all things which
[52:09] is the head even Christ so let's write
[52:13] this next one down we're still on the
[52:16] purpose of the fivefold
[52:18] ministry so it's amazing how quickly we
[52:21] turned from a man in a pull pit yeah
[52:26] to the purpose of the Min to the
[52:29] people so I say the emphasis in the
[52:32] scripture is not the men this gift is
[52:34] and the emphasis is what it's doing to
[52:36] all of
[52:37] us that was the purpose that's the
[52:40] emphasis and they're going to continue
[52:41] to
[52:43] minister that we so our
[52:47] purpose that
[52:52] we are
[52:54] not
[52:56] carried
[52:59] about by
[53:01] every
[53:04] wind of
[53:12] Doctrine the fful ministry is here to
[53:17] stabilize the
[53:19] church so every new thought that comes
[53:21] in doesn't send us
[53:24] running every new teaching every new
[53:28] idea amen we the ministry is here to
[53:32] bring a stabilization amen the ministry
[53:34] shouldn't be the ones bringing
[53:38] instability they should bringing us a
[53:40] stability Amen to where now every new
[53:43] thing that sweeps through it doesn't it
[53:45] doesn't scatter it doesn't cause us to
[53:46] run it doesn't cause us to get tossed to
[53:48] and fro amen we're already stabilized we
[53:51] already know who we are in Christ we
[53:53] already know that we have been chosen by
[53:54] God and God is revealing himself to us
[53:57] and every new thing that comes down it
[53:59] may be a direct Revelation from God it
[54:01] may be another wind of Doctrine that's
[54:03] moving through amen but I don't have to
[54:06] be shaken if it's God who reveal it to
[54:08] me because I'm stable in who I am I am
[54:11] his bride he will reveal the truth to me
[54:14] I don't need tossed around like a child
[54:17] because of every new teaching that comes
[54:19] I can hold steady amen what's going to
[54:21] Help Me Hold Steady this is the purpose
[54:23] of the five-fold ministry so you have a
[54:25] true identification of who you are
[54:27] coming into a maturity so you don't get
[54:29] knocked around every time something new
[54:31] sweeps through cuz something new may be
[54:33] absolutely genuine from God another
[54:35] level he wants to take us through it
[54:37] could be another mixed idea of man amen
[54:39] and we don't know we could get tossed
[54:41] and Scattered and run about and arguing
[54:44] and fighting with who's right and who's
[54:45] wrong what we need to do is be stable
[54:47] and not be like children and Hold Steady
[54:49] if it's of God it'll ring true it'll
[54:51] ring true it'll ring true it'll stay
[54:53] it'll grow and it won't change amen but
[54:57] I don't need to worry about it if half
[54:59] my brothers see it and I don't see it
[55:01] that shouldn't change my identification
[55:03] with who I am I need to wait till God
[55:06] shows me
[55:07] amen way I don't need to pretend I see
[55:10] something I don't
[55:12] see that means I don't need to go with
[55:14] the crowd because this is the more
[55:16] spiritual
[55:19] crowd I don't need to give up my my my
[55:23] own discernment amen because this is a
[55:25] more senior brother amen no I'm not
[55:28] getting tossed by every wind of Doctrine
[55:30] a true fold ministry will establish the
[55:32] bride so they're not getting tossed
[55:34] about they're not immature they've come
[55:36] into a place where they know who they
[55:37] are and when something new comes they
[55:39] can say praise the Lord if this is from
[55:41] God it'll ring true let's just wait I
[55:43] don't see it yet but let's just
[55:47] watch tell you something else that it'll
[55:49] do amen they'll just watch until they
[55:52] see the nature of that thing
[55:56] go sounds good it sounds
[56:00] good but what life is it
[56:03] producing what's the nature of that
[56:06] thing I'm not getting tossed about by
[56:09] everything that sounds good but behind
[56:11] it comes an arrogant spirit and behind
[56:13] it becomes a nasty attitude and behind
[56:15] it becomes
[56:18] division no I think I'll just
[56:21] wait because I'm not going to lose my
[56:23] sunship that's right
[56:26] I'm not going to lose my position with
[56:28] Christ I'm not rejecting the word I'm
[56:30] just not jumping
[56:35] in
[56:36] amen the ministry should be making the
[56:39] Believers
[56:41] stable
[56:45] mature until
[56:48] we
[56:51] grow
[56:53] up
[56:56] into
[56:57] him I love this part in all
[57:04] things who is the
[57:09] head
[57:11] Christ
[57:15] am the fivefold ministry is going to
[57:18] keep working until we grow
[57:21] up unto him in All Things
[57:26] am not just some
[57:29] things I said I believe with all my
[57:31] heart many of us has grown up into him
[57:33] in some some things but there's still
[57:35] some things I need to grow up in I don't
[57:37] know if you're like me but I'm still
[57:39] growing amen I've grown up into the head
[57:41] in some things but there's other things
[57:43] amen there's things there's days when
[57:44] I'm like oh Lord I'm so glad that you
[57:47] chose me before the foundation of the
[57:49] world cuz you wouldn't choose me
[57:52] now amen but the B Ministry is supposed
[57:55] to help us till we grow unto him in all
[57:59] things in every area of our life till we
[58:02] grow to full maturity to the Head where
[58:05] the head has full control of all things
[58:07] in our life so many times he has control
[58:11] amen of our conduct but he doesn't have
[58:14] control of our fears
[58:16] amen sometimes he has control of our
[58:19] eyes but not control of our mouth or
[58:20] control of our mouth but not control of
[58:22] our eyes our control of our eyes but not
[58:24] control of our thoughts
[58:25] thoughts but we're going to keep going
[58:27] till we grow up un him in all things in
[58:30] the head till the head has absolute pre
[58:33] predominance Over All of
[58:35] Me
[58:36] amen and so I I want to go back and read
[58:39] this scripture again because I love the
[58:42] way uh verse 14 moves into verse 15 so
[58:45] let's pay attention to this that we
[58:47] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[58:49] and fro and carried about with every
[58:51] wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and
[58:53] cunning craftiness whereby by they lie
[58:55] and wait to deceive but speaking the
[58:57] truth in love may grow up into him in
[58:59] all things which is the head even Christ
[59:03] I love how this goes from Doctrine to
[59:07] truth yes sir amen pay close attention
[59:10] to that
[59:12] transition that we're no more children
[59:14] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[59:15] every wind of
[59:18] Doctrine but we are speaking the truth
[59:21] in
[59:23] love you know it's not about Doctrine
[59:25] it's about the
[59:27] truth and the truth brings the correct
[59:29] Doctrine we're not opposed to Doctrine
[59:31] Doctrine just means teaching I love
[59:34] Doctrine amen but there's some teaching
[59:36] that's not
[59:38] truth there's some teaching that's not
[59:41] the point but but that we're not cared
[59:43] about by every window of Doctrine but
[59:46] we're speaking the truth amen what am I
[59:49] always speaking I'm not repeating what
[59:50] somebody else says I'm not trying to
[59:52] understand something but I'm just
[59:53] speaking the truth truth amen what I
[59:55] know to be true what I see what I was
[59:58] revealed to me what I see is the
[59:59] scripture what I know to be absolutely
[1:00:02] the word of God I'm just speaking the
[1:00:04] truth with
[1:00:06] love I love that little transfer from
[1:00:10] Doctrine which is
[1:00:12] tossing to truth which is an expression
[1:00:15] of
[1:00:16] love I love how the Bible's
[1:00:19] written
[1:00:21] now I believe verse 16 is the
[1:00:23] culmination
[1:00:25] of the whole
[1:00:26] subject why we have a fful
[1:00:30] Ministry from whom so the last verse
[1:00:33] says that we may grow into him in all
[1:00:36] things which is the head even Christ
[1:00:38] from whom so from Christ from the head
[1:00:41] the whole body fitly joined together
[1:00:45] that means tightly joined together amen
[1:00:50] and compacted that word compacted means
[1:00:53] knit or coales
[1:00:55] together actually woven together so not
[1:00:58] only we're tight together we become
[1:01:00] woven
[1:01:01] together and compacted
[1:01:04] by that which every joint supplieth
[1:01:10] every joint is every
[1:01:13] Bond every Bond amen listen you're not a
[1:01:19] joint the joint is every Bond you have
[1:01:22] with another
[1:01:23] believer
[1:01:26] by by every joint
[1:01:29] supplieth so every joint every bond
[1:01:32] between Believers is supplying something
[1:01:35] according to the
[1:01:36] effectual working in the measure of
[1:01:40] every part making increase of the body
[1:01:44] unto the edifying of itself in
[1:01:48] love this verse 16 to me is the
[1:01:52] culmination of the whole matter what is
[1:01:54] the the purpose of the fold Ministry
[1:01:56] verse 16 till every member every part
[1:02:00] every joint is doing their part to build
[1:02:03] up Christ now this isn't the job of the
[1:02:06] fivefold ministry to build up Christ
[1:02:08] it's the five of it's It's the job of
[1:02:10] the fivefold ministry to equip every
[1:02:12] part till every part builds itself up in
[1:02:17] love you know why I like this part so
[1:02:20] much it's a shift of
[1:02:23] responsibility
[1:02:25] and it makes me feel good because we
[1:02:27] can't expect the preachers to do all
[1:02:28] this amen the preachers have their part
[1:02:30] amen and and all they're doing is
[1:02:32] surrendering to Christ on the inside to
[1:02:34] the gift that's there and that gift is
[1:02:36] there to equip us to perfect us to grow
[1:02:39] us to stabilize us to do all of those
[1:02:41] things until amen we come in into a
[1:02:44] mature believer until we come into the
[1:02:46] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:02:48] we're not tossed about that we're
[1:02:50] established that we can speak the truth
[1:02:52] in love that we can grow up into the
[1:02:53] head and all things that we can become
[1:02:56] tightly bound to our brothers woven
[1:02:58] together and be a joint that Supply Amen
[1:03:01] to every need and builds itself the body
[1:03:05] builds itself together in
[1:03:09] love now there's no way that you can
[1:03:12] come on a Sunday and come on a Wednesday
[1:03:14] and go home and hope that the preachers
[1:03:16] do a good job and hope that they
[1:03:17] complete this work amen they're only
[1:03:19] here to equip you to stabilize you to to
[1:03:21] to to give you the knowledge of the Son
[1:03:23] of God Amen so that you can finish the
[1:03:25] work of building the body of Christ it's
[1:03:28] every single member it's every part to
[1:03:30] the measure of every part every joint
[1:03:32] everyone is the one who's going to
[1:03:34] finish this work the preachers are not
[1:03:37] going to complete the body of Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ the members are going to build
[1:03:41] themselves together in
[1:03:44] love so you can see how the wrong
[1:03:47] attitude to the fful ministry on either
[1:03:49] part either the ministers or the people
[1:03:51] will actually become a deterrence to the
[1:03:53] purpose of the fivefold ministry and it
[1:03:56] will actually handicap and Railroad and
[1:03:58] and deter God's actual purpose for the
[1:04:01] ministry gifts he ascended on high and
[1:04:03] he gave gifts unto men what were those
[1:04:05] gifts to do it was supposed to get us in
[1:04:07] position so that we can finish the work
[1:04:09] that was left for this day for each one
[1:04:12] of us to do now who's responsible for
[1:04:14] the body of Christ now I'm responsible
[1:04:16] for the body of Christ you're
[1:04:18] responsible each one of us have a
[1:04:20] responsibility Amen to be a joint that
[1:04:23] supply and the meure of every
[1:04:28] part I love this
[1:04:31] part because the whole success of the
[1:04:34] whole body is not rested on the fold
[1:04:38] Ministry it's shifted the
[1:04:41] responsibility to every individual
[1:04:46] member nobody's coasting no sir nobody's
[1:04:51] free
[1:04:52] riding no nobody's just taking up space
[1:04:56] that's right nobody's just along for the
[1:05:02] ride you see how everything changes yes
[1:05:05] sir this is when the preacher starts
[1:05:07] feeling so much
[1:05:11] better if I can just stay out of the way
[1:05:13] and let God do what he's going to do
[1:05:16] then the body is going to do what it's
[1:05:18] supposed to
[1:05:19] do and I don't have to carry the whole
[1:05:22] weight of the full responsibility
[1:05:24] because there's no way the fivefold
[1:05:26] ministry can do this this is Way Beyond
[1:05:31] ministers this all falls on every one of
[1:05:35] us so let's read this again from whom
[1:05:38] the whole body fitly joined together
[1:05:42] tightly together and compacted knit
[1:05:45] together by that which every joint
[1:05:48] Supply how did it get fitly formed
[1:05:50] together and knit together by every
[1:05:53] joint every bond between Believers
[1:05:55] supplying
[1:05:57] something something has to come out of
[1:05:59] you into the other
[1:06:04] believers
[1:06:06] amen according to the effectual
[1:06:10] working that word effectual is an
[1:06:12] unusual word it means it can be
[1:06:15] interpreted efficient or an efficient
[1:06:18] working but almost every time it's used
[1:06:21] in the New Testament it's used of
[1:06:22] Supernatural power
[1:06:26] this effectual working is more than just
[1:06:28] our effort this is God and every
[1:06:32] member to the effectual or effective or
[1:06:36] efficient working in the measure of
[1:06:40] every part are you part of the body
[1:06:44] amen then here we are making increase of
[1:06:48] the body what body the body of Christ
[1:06:52] making increase of the body unto the
[1:06:54] edifying building up of
[1:06:57] itself in
[1:07:01] love praise
[1:07:04] God I'm going to write
[1:07:08] here until we
[1:07:12] all because I'm included in this every
[1:07:16] part of the five home Ministry is
[1:07:17] included in this because we're part of
[1:07:18] the body you know I've said before in
[1:07:22] conversation I might have said it from
[1:07:23] the pull pit
[1:07:24] I don't need to be a preacher to be a
[1:07:27] Son of
[1:07:29] God like I do this not because I even
[1:07:32] wanted to it's not that I don't want to
[1:07:35] I don't want you to take that the wrong
[1:07:36] way it's not like I hate it I love
[1:07:37] serving God's people I want to do
[1:07:39] exactly what God calls me to do but I
[1:07:41] wasn't looking to minister when God
[1:07:43] called me and I was never looking to
[1:07:44] Pastor when God supernaturally called me
[1:07:47] I I was very content in the role that I
[1:07:50] was in so I never did this because I
[1:07:53] wanted it I did this because God called
[1:07:55] me to it was God's purpose I'm very
[1:07:57] happy being a Son of God and I can't
[1:07:59] think of any title that you could attach
[1:08:01] to that would to be better than just Son
[1:08:03] of God how can you be Son of God and
[1:08:06] make it just a notch better with another
[1:08:08] title you know if I had Deacon behind it
[1:08:10] that if I had Pastor no son of God's the
[1:08:14] highest honor that we could ever have
[1:08:16] being a child of almighty God is the
[1:08:18] very highest thing that we could ever
[1:08:20] achieve after that we all have different
[1:08:22] roles to play and different parts in the
[1:08:24] body different things he want us to do
[1:08:26] but don't ever if we ever get the
[1:08:27] attitude that Ministry or or office in
[1:08:30] the church or a special gift of
[1:08:32] songwriting or singing or or whatever
[1:08:34] amen that that's somehow the Pinnacle my
[1:08:37] goodness the Pinnacle is to be a son or
[1:08:39] daughter of God that's the very best
[1:08:40] thing that you could ever
[1:08:42] be and then if wherever God places you
[1:08:45] in that body you're placed there to be a
[1:08:48] joint that Supply Amen to the effectual
[1:08:50] working of the measure of every part as
[1:08:53] it edifies itself together and and to
[1:08:56] build the body in love amen you sing
[1:08:58] songs Amen to edify the body you write a
[1:09:01] song to edify the body amen you take
[1:09:03] care of the facilities amen you sweep
[1:09:05] the floor you fix a meal for a friend
[1:09:08] you do whatever God's called you to do
[1:09:10] the build up the body not to be
[1:09:12] something better in the kingdom of God
[1:09:14] and not to have a better title and not
[1:09:16] to get some more accolades you do it
[1:09:18] because you're an effectual part working
[1:09:20] and supplying and through every
[1:09:22] joint
[1:09:24] but the greatest thing I could ever be
[1:09:26] is a Son of God if I stop preaching
[1:09:28] tomorrow I'll be a Son of God if I never
[1:09:30] get in the pull pit again I'll be a Son
[1:09:32] of God and just as content to be a Son
[1:09:34] of God as anything in the world that's
[1:09:36] the greatest honor of my life whether
[1:09:38] I'm standing here or sitting there I
[1:09:40] prefer to sit
[1:09:44] there it's
[1:09:46] better which is funner brother Gabe
[1:09:49] sitting by your wife or standing up
[1:09:52] here I'd rather sit next to to my wife
[1:09:54] every
[1:09:56] Sunday but I can't do that and stay true
[1:09:59] to what God's called me to do I can't do
[1:10:02] that and be obedient to Christ I can't
[1:10:04] do that and serve the body and be the
[1:10:06] joint I'm supposed to be amen so now
[1:10:09] it's not about Prestige honor offices
[1:10:14] it's about
[1:10:17] service how am I supposed to serve the
[1:10:21] body how am I a joint that
[1:10:25] supplies how am I working together in
[1:10:29] the measure of my part to build the body
[1:10:33] in love this is the responsibility each
[1:10:36] one of us need to come to terms with
[1:10:39] because this is our
[1:10:41] responsibility until we
[1:10:46] all
[1:10:48] become a
[1:10:51] joint that supplieth
[1:10:55] how do you spell Supply there's TW
[1:10:59] PS that's all of
[1:11:02] us that's not the
[1:11:05] officers that's not the ones with a
[1:11:09] title that's all of
[1:11:12] us we're all responsible for this every
[1:11:16] one of us have to be a measure a part
[1:11:20] that builds the body now I'm I'm
[1:11:24] personally
[1:11:27] responsible for building the body of
[1:11:29] Christ
[1:11:32] am now I become personally responsible
[1:11:35] for the health of that
[1:11:37] body personally responsible for the
[1:11:40] growth of that
[1:11:43] body what now the question is what can I
[1:11:47] do to help
[1:11:49] grow what can I do to supply what can
[1:11:53] can I do we'll get to that in a
[1:11:57] minute
[1:12:00] until every
[1:12:04] part is
[1:12:12] working
[1:12:15] two
[1:12:17] increase the
[1:12:22] body to
[1:12:25] build the
[1:12:28] body in
[1:12:32] love this is what we are all responsible
[1:12:37] for this is the
[1:12:39] conclusion of the purpose of a five-fold
[1:12:48] Ministry I love
[1:12:50] it it's not about gifted men
[1:12:55] it's not about great gifts and super
[1:12:57] duper preaching and platform
[1:12:59] performances that stun and wow an
[1:13:02] audience that's not what this is
[1:13:05] about it's become that many times
[1:13:09] because of the Fallen nature of all of
[1:13:12] us and we should just say all of
[1:13:16] us but that's not the
[1:13:19] point the point is this is supposed to
[1:13:22] be God
[1:13:24] equipping his
[1:13:26] children growing them maturing them
[1:13:29] building them equipping them stabilizing
[1:13:33] them so that each one of them can finish
[1:13:37] the work and grow the body supply and
[1:13:42] increase
[1:13:43] remember brother Brenham said Jesus
[1:13:45] didn't finish all of his work in his
[1:13:47] Earthly Ministry left some of it to be
[1:13:49] done in and through the
[1:13:52] bride he didn't didn't say 10% of the
[1:13:54] Bride the ones with offices and
[1:13:57] positions and
[1:13:58] titles we all have a part to play and
[1:14:02] finishing the work of Christ until we
[1:14:05] all come in to the stature of a perfect
[1:14:09] man uh when I look at
[1:14:14] this I want to back up now and read the
[1:14:17] beginning part of chapter 4 I skipped
[1:14:19] down for a purpose now I want to get to
[1:14:21] the the beginning chapter 4
[1:14:23] 4 verse
[1:14:25] one therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:14:29] therefore I therefore the prisoner of
[1:14:30] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:14:33] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[1:14:35] called that vocation is not job that
[1:14:37] vocation just means your calling your
[1:14:40] invitation that you all walk worthy of
[1:14:42] the calling wherewith you are called
[1:14:44] with all
[1:14:46] lonliness loneliness is is humility with
[1:14:50] all humility and meekness meekness means
[1:14:53] means gentleness with all loneliness and
[1:14:56] meekness and longsuffering that's
[1:14:58] patience and forbearing that's caring
[1:15:01] for one
[1:15:02] another forbearing one another in
[1:15:07] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:15:10] the spirit in the bond of Peace there is
[1:15:13] one body and one Spirit even as you are
[1:15:16] called in one hope of your calling one
[1:15:18] Lord One Faith one baptism one God and
[1:15:21] Father of all who is above all all and
[1:15:23] through all and in you all but but unto
[1:15:27] every one of us is given Grace according
[1:15:29] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[1:15:31] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:15:33] on high he led captivity and he gave
[1:15:36] gifts unto men so I love this precursor
[1:15:40] because he starts off with all of
[1:15:43] you walk with
[1:15:46] humility gentleness patience caring for
[1:15:50] one another endeavoring to keep the
[1:15:52] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:15:55] and then he goes right into God gave
[1:15:56] gifts he goes into the five gifts what
[1:15:59] the five gifts are supposed to do for
[1:16:00] each one of us and he ends amen this
[1:16:04] whole portion of this dialogue with
[1:16:06] every part now do your part he started
[1:16:09] with every part Walk This Way and end
[1:16:12] with every part do your
[1:16:14] part so this section of scripture is not
[1:16:17] about the five gifts this section of
[1:16:20] scripture is about what all of us are
[1:16:22] supposed to do and the five Ministry
[1:16:24] gifts are supposed to help us do
[1:16:28] that praise God let's go to 1
[1:16:31] Corinthians chapter 12 I'm just going to
[1:16:33] read a couple lengthy scripture readings
[1:16:35] together as we wind down this will be
[1:16:37] just the first
[1:16:39] part and we'll pick it up again later 1
[1:16:43] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4 now there
[1:16:47] are diversities of gifts but the same
[1:16:50] spirit and there are differences of
[1:16:52] administration ation but the same lord
[1:16:54] and there are diversities of operations
[1:16:56] but is the same God which worketh all
[1:16:59] and in
[1:17:01] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:17:03] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:17:06] I'm going to stop here let's look at
[1:17:07] this for just a
[1:17:09] second there are diversities of gifts so
[1:17:13] there there is this is a lot of
[1:17:15] different
[1:17:17] gifts whenever he mentions the gifts he
[1:17:20] starts going through the gifts every
[1:17:22] account there's a Romans account there's
[1:17:24] a Corinthians account and there's one
[1:17:26] other maybe two in Corinthians he always
[1:17:28] gives different gifts it's never the
[1:17:31] same gifts listed because there's
[1:17:34] diversity of gifts but the Same
[1:17:38] Spirit right and there are differences
[1:17:42] of administrations there's different
[1:17:44] ways that gift is
[1:17:47] administered but it's the same lord and
[1:17:50] there are diversities of operations
[1:17:52] there's different ways that it's
[1:17:54] operated so all of a sudden this
[1:17:56] scripture just ripped open our
[1:17:58] preconceived ideas about what gifts are
[1:18:00] amen amen there's many gifts with many
[1:18:04] administrations and many different
[1:18:06] operations amen there's not just a
[1:18:08] couple there we know that there's nine
[1:18:09] main spiritual gifts but there's lots of
[1:18:11] other gifts because the Apostle Paul
[1:18:13] mentions other gifts outside of
[1:18:16] those so we don't want to just get
[1:18:18] narrowed down amen anything amen
[1:18:21] anything that the spirit of God God
[1:18:23] gives you to do to supply the rest of
[1:18:25] the body is a gift to the
[1:18:30] body
[1:18:32] and verse seven but the manifestation of
[1:18:36] the spirit is given to every man to
[1:18:39] profit with
[1:18:41] all that means whatever he gives to you
[1:18:44] is for everybody
[1:18:46] else a gift is not given to you for you
[1:18:49] a gift is given to you for the body
[1:18:52] remember remember brother Brandon was
[1:18:53] standing at the pull pit praying for
[1:18:56] people who were sick so sick he would
[1:18:58] have to grip the edge of the pull pit CU
[1:18:59] he was so weak he was about to collapse
[1:19:01] with his stomach issue and he was so
[1:19:03] weakened by it he couldn't hardly stand
[1:19:05] gripping the pull pit praying for people
[1:19:07] and every one of them is getting healed
[1:19:09] but he's not getting healed and he says
[1:19:11] the gift wasn't for me it's for you
[1:19:14] brother B says in one place he says
[1:19:17] listen he said you would think because I
[1:19:18] have a gift of Prophecy God would just
[1:19:19] always show me in a vision what to do
[1:19:21] but he just lets me sit he doesn't
[1:19:23] always show me I have to sweat it
[1:19:26] out and one place he says I'm standing
[1:19:28] like an orphan this
[1:19:31] morning God's left me the gift wasn't
[1:19:34] for him the gift was for me that man's
[1:19:36] gift was for me to build me up to supply
[1:19:40] me to build up the body of Christ in
[1:19:42] love and build this part up that gift
[1:19:44] was for me it wasn't for him in fact he
[1:19:48] W I mean he wasn't a tremendous
[1:19:50] benefactor of that gift it cost him a
[1:19:52] lot yes it costed him his friends it
[1:19:55] cost him mental strain it cost him
[1:19:57] stress it caused him all kinds of
[1:19:59] difficulty I I I would venture to say it
[1:20:02] would have been much easier for him just
[1:20:04] to be a good Christian and a good church
[1:20:05] and a good bible church and to raise his
[1:20:07] family and to love his wife and stay at
[1:20:09] home every evening and work his
[1:20:11] Powerline job and come home every
[1:20:12] evening and hunt all he
[1:20:16] wanted that gift wasn't for him that
[1:20:19] gift was for
[1:20:21] me
[1:20:24] and so the spirit the manifestation of
[1:20:26] the spirit is given to every man for
[1:20:29] with
[1:20:30] all for everyone
[1:20:33] else
[1:20:35] and the Apostle Paul is going to take
[1:20:38] the body of Christ and he's going to
[1:20:41] match it to our physical bodies he's
[1:20:43] going to use an analogy and he's going
[1:20:44] to make the natural type to spiritual
[1:20:47] amen and Paul's the one who's going to
[1:20:48] establish this and he's going to talk
[1:20:50] about we're going to ready to read about
[1:20:51] it here in a little bit but if you think
[1:20:53] about it I can't think of one member in
[1:20:56] my body that is in my body to serve
[1:21:03] itself can you think of any part of your
[1:21:05] body that only exist to serve
[1:21:10] itself I've been thinking about it and
[1:21:12] I'm scared to say that because somebody
[1:21:14] will come up with some super clever
[1:21:15] genius
[1:21:16] idea but as I've been meditating I can't
[1:21:19] think of any part of my body that solely
[1:21:22] exists serve itself but every member in
[1:21:25] my body is serving another part of my
[1:21:27] body or the body and whole either
[1:21:30] directly or
[1:21:32] indirectly so what do you think we're on
[1:21:34] this planet for what do you think you're
[1:21:36] in a church for what do you think you're
[1:21:37] in the bride for amen whatever gifts God
[1:21:40] has given to you amen they're not there
[1:21:42] to make you rich to give you an easy
[1:21:44] life they have a big retirement account
[1:21:45] and retire and travel the world on
[1:21:47] cruise ships whatever God gift God has
[1:21:49] given to you he's given to you to profit
[1:21:52] with all
[1:21:53] amen whatever is in you is for
[1:21:56] me whatever you're good at is for my
[1:21:59] benefit whatever gift you have is for me
[1:22:02] amen so I'm tired of you being
[1:22:06] selfish I'm tired of you withh holding I
[1:22:09] want what's
[1:22:15] mine praise
[1:22:17] God let's keep
[1:22:20] reading let's go on verse 8
[1:22:23] for to one is given the spirit of the
[1:22:25] word of wisdom to another the word of
[1:22:27] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:22:29] Faith by The Same Spirit to another
[1:22:31] Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[1:22:33] another the working of Miracles to
[1:22:35] another prophecy to another Discerning
[1:22:37] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[1:22:39] tongues to another the interpretation of
[1:22:41] tongues but all these work at that one
[1:22:43] and selfsame spirit dividing to every
[1:22:46] man severly as he
[1:22:48] will you don't have a gift because you
[1:22:51] were super
[1:22:53] special God is just divided severly as
[1:22:56] he
[1:22:57] will you know brother Gabe was talking
[1:22:59] about the grab
[1:23:00] bag you didn't listen you didn't decide
[1:23:04] what gift you were going to have amen
[1:23:06] that was given to
[1:23:08] you so you can't take any special
[1:23:12] pride in it because God gave it to
[1:23:16] you neither should we use it just for
[1:23:19] ourselves verse 12 for as the body is
[1:23:21] one and ha many members and all the
[1:23:23] members of the one body being many or
[1:23:25] one body so also is Christ what is
[1:23:29] Christ he's a many membered body that's
[1:23:30] what this is telling us for by one
[1:23:33] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:23:35] whether we Jews or Gentiles whether we
[1:23:37] be Bond or free and have all been made
[1:23:39] to drink into the one spirit for the
[1:23:41] body is not one member but many if the
[1:23:44] foot shall say because I am not the hand
[1:23:45] I am not of the body is it therefore not
[1:23:47] of the body and if the ear shall say
[1:23:50] because I am not the eye I am not of the
[1:23:51] body is it there therefore not of the
[1:23:53] body if the whole body were an eye where
[1:23:55] were the hearing if the whole were
[1:23:57] hearing where were the smelling but now
[1:23:59] hath God set the members every one of
[1:24:01] them in the body as it hath pleased him
[1:24:03] and if they were all one member where
[1:24:05] were the body but now are they many
[1:24:08] members yet one body and the eye cannot
[1:24:10] say unto the hand I have no need of thee
[1:24:13] nor again the head to the feet I have no
[1:24:15] need of you nay much more those members
[1:24:17] of the body which seem to be more feeble
[1:24:20] are necessary and those me MERS of the
[1:24:22] body which we think to be less honorable
[1:24:25] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[1:24:27] and our uncomely parts have more
[1:24:29] abundant
[1:24:31] cless say what are you talking about
[1:24:33] brother Chad what's Paul saying it says
[1:24:37] the height of your
[1:24:39] cheekbones don't
[1:24:41] matter just the fact that you got them
[1:24:44] and your mouth moves what you consider
[1:24:45] beautiful and you know the shape of your
[1:24:48] lips who cares as long as you got lips
[1:24:51] as long as you can suck on a straw when
[1:24:53] you get a Slurpee you know they function
[1:24:56] they work we call that beautiful and we
[1:24:58] pay attention to that but I mean I'm
[1:25:01] pretty sure my pancreas is pretty nasty
[1:25:04] looking but it's pretty
[1:25:08] important brother Bram said this I he
[1:25:11] goes the success of these meetings is
[1:25:13] because there's two sisters way back in
[1:25:14] the wilderness praying the Unseen part
[1:25:18] the part that's not glorious the part
[1:25:20] that doesn't get a lot of attention the
[1:25:22] part where people pray in the night and
[1:25:24] come here on Saturday evenings and pray
[1:25:26] for the service on Sunday amen it might
[1:25:28] get noticed just about as much as your
[1:25:30] pancreas get noticed but you try living
[1:25:32] one day without your pancreas and see
[1:25:34] how far you get amen we need the body
[1:25:37] everybody contributing whether we see it
[1:25:39] or don't see it we don't see every phone
[1:25:42] call we don't see every text of
[1:25:43] encouragement we don't see every prayer
[1:25:45] amen but those are the things that are
[1:25:47] keeping us going
[1:25:50] amen the things that we think are
[1:25:52] beautiful we could do without right I'm
[1:25:55] sorry but that some of the Pomp and some
[1:25:57] of the prestige and some of the visible
[1:25:59] stuff we could actually do without it
[1:26:01] but some of those things that we we
[1:26:03] don't see the love and care for one
[1:26:04] another the picking each up other when
[1:26:06] they're down the prayer that we have for
[1:26:08] one another we don't see it but we
[1:26:09] cannot make it without that the faith
[1:26:11] that we have in one another the belief
[1:26:13] that we have the pull on the word we may
[1:26:15] not see those things but we have nothing
[1:26:17] going here without
[1:26:20] that says in verse 24 for our comely
[1:26:23] Parts have no need but God has tempered
[1:26:26] the body together having given more
[1:26:28] abundant honor to the part which
[1:26:30] lacketh you do without a part for a
[1:26:36] minute you do without one and you
[1:26:39] realize boy I missed that I preached
[1:26:42] this up in British Columbia and I told
[1:26:43] him about my teeth you know I got lots
[1:26:46] of teeth I don't know how many adults
[1:26:47] have teeth is there a dental hygienist
[1:26:51] here
[1:26:52] where's Amy Preston she would know how
[1:26:56] many teeth is an adult suppos I don't
[1:26:57] know but in the back right Muller I
[1:27:00] don't have one anymore cuz I went to the
[1:27:02] dentist and my tooth was cracked and the
[1:27:04] dentist says I can put a crown on it and
[1:27:06] I said how much he said $2,000 and he
[1:27:08] says or I can pull it for 50 bucks well
[1:27:10] for me that's a no-brainer I had no
[1:27:11] dental insurance I was like just yank it
[1:27:13] out there how fast can you get it
[1:27:17] going and I thought I got plenty of
[1:27:19] teeth I'll chew on the right side you
[1:27:21] know every time I get a corner of a
[1:27:23] Dorito
[1:27:26] sideways I about come out of my
[1:27:29] skin and it doesn't happen all the time
[1:27:31] but every time it happens I wish I had
[1:27:33] that tooth and I wish ID pay $2,000 for
[1:27:35] a
[1:27:37] crown we bestow much more honor to that
[1:27:40] which lack it what if we showed up to
[1:27:42] church and we didn't have a single piano
[1:27:45] player it may not get noticed cuz it's
[1:27:47] always there it's always there but the
[1:27:49] day it's not there is the day you
[1:27:50] realize hey we need something we don't
[1:27:52] have a song leader we don't have
[1:27:53] musician we don't have anybody running
[1:27:55] sound we don't have anybody that unlock
[1:27:56] the doors you know we all need one
[1:27:59] another and the point is anytime we
[1:28:01] start to miss one another there's the
[1:28:03] lack and all of a sudden that becomes
[1:28:04] the most important
[1:28:07] part praise
[1:28:09] God verse 25 that there should be no
[1:28:12] Schism in the body God has set this up
[1:28:14] that we absolutely need one another so
[1:28:16] that we won't learn to do without one
[1:28:18] another that there'll be no Schism in
[1:28:20] the body but that the members should
[1:28:21] have the same care one for another and
[1:28:23] whether one member suffer all members
[1:28:25] suffer with it or one member be honored
[1:28:28] all members Rejoice with it now ye are
[1:28:30] the body of Christ and members in
[1:28:33] particular and God has set some in the
[1:28:35] church first apostles secondary prophets
[1:28:37] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[1:28:39] then Gifts of healing
[1:28:41] helps
[1:28:42] governments diversities of tongues are
[1:28:46] all Apostles are all prophets are all
[1:28:48] teachers no we don't all do
[1:28:51] everything I love
[1:28:53] this you know sometimes we hear
[1:28:56] preaching on the
[1:28:57] gifts we need the gifts and do we need
[1:29:00] the gifts we need the gifts the gift
[1:29:02] should be in the church the gift should
[1:29:03] never leave the church we need gifts in
[1:29:05] the church but I wonder how time when
[1:29:07] people get really fired up preaching
[1:29:09] about the gifts in the church nobody
[1:29:10] starts going through
[1:29:14] helps we need Holy Ghost helps in the
[1:29:16] church amen and if you don't have helps
[1:29:18] in the church you're not the right kind
[1:29:19] of
[1:29:20] church
[1:29:23] if we're going to promote gifts let's
[1:29:25] promote them all if we're going to want
[1:29:26] them let's want them all not just the
[1:29:28] comely ones let's have all of them amen
[1:29:31] everything God has given there's helps
[1:29:33] there's governments there's all of these
[1:29:34] things there's giving there's those are
[1:29:36] all gifts that are mentioned in the

[1:29:40] about helps what we need is helps in the
[1:29:41] church we need governments in the church

[1:29:52] amen some of that is seen some of that
[1:29:54] is unseen some of it's comely some of
[1:29:55] it's uncomely some of it's a help some
[1:29:57] of it's a government and one of the
[1:29:59] gifts is to rule amen amen somebody's
[1:30:04] got to be in charge that's a gift of the
[1:30:07] spirit somebody has to be a
[1:30:09] helper somebody's got to be a helper
[1:30:12] there's a gift called

[1:31:02] amen this is not about applying for a
[1:31:04] job this is not about filling out a
[1:31:06] resume and trying to find no this is
[1:31:08] about the spirit of God placing in the
[1:31:10] body everything it needs am mean we need
[1:31:12] encouragers we need lovers we need we
[1:31:14] need people who will care for other
[1:31:16] people we need somebody who will think
[1:31:18] of somebody
[1:31:20] else and make sure that they're in
[1:31:22] fellowship and not secluded and left
[1:31:24] alone the body needs so
[1:31:28] much that none of us are
[1:31:31] excluded not one of us get to sit this
[1:31:34] out and none of us free ride and loaf
[1:31:37] letting everybody else carry the weight

[1:32:18] life I always tell people God only made
[1:32:21] a few perfect TS in the world and he
[1:32:23] covered the rest of them with
[1:32:28] hair praise
[1:32:30] God there one nice thing about being a
[1:32:32] preacher is nobody can give you a
[1:32:33] comeback right

[1:32:39] I'll get all kinds of texts and emails
[1:32:42] but praise God no part of my body is
[1:32:47] extra no part's there just hanging out
[1:32:50] it's there for a purpose
[1:32:52] none of us are just
[1:32:54] here we're here for a
[1:32:57] purpose that's the fful ministry is here
[1:33:00] to equip us to serve our purpose not to
[1:33:04] be our heroes not to pull the wagon
[1:33:07] while everybody sits in it the officers
[1:33:10] of the church are not here to be hitch
[1:33:11] to the wagon and pull it and everybody
[1:33:13] jumps in and we're on a hay ride no we
[1:33:15] are all here to serve a
[1:33:19] part and what's my part I don't know but

[1:33:24] you whatever your part is is already in
[1:33:27] you and the right occasion at the right
[1:33:29] time in the right circumstance it'll
[1:33:31] just pop

[1:33:35] you're doing and you'll never even
[1:33:37] realize half the time you're just
[1:33:39] serving you're just caring you're just
[1:33:40] doing you're just giving you're just
[1:33:42] thinking you're just
[1:33:44] saying and it just comes natural the key
[1:33:48] is to be plugged into the
[1:33:49] body to be under the anointing of the
[1:33:52] five full ministry because that's where
[1:33:54] you get equipped to do your job be
[1:33:57] connected to the body under the headship

[1:34:02] fful ministry and then be open to be a
