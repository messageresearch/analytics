[0:00] Paul was a prisoner Bound by chains of
[0:02] love to Jesus Christ
[0:04] not by a law not by rules not by a
[0:08] religious code but by his love for the
[0:10] person of Jesus Christ
[0:13] he was bound until all he wanted to do
[0:15] was please him
[0:18] and we bind ourselves in a loving
[0:20] relationship with a husband and wife
[0:21] until we're committed we can have faith
[0:23] in one another even if we're separated
[0:25] over great distances amen I I traveled
[0:29] the world I can be on the opposite side
[0:31] of the planet and I have no question
[0:33] whatsoever about the faithfulness of my
[0:35] wife and she has no question whatsoever
[0:37] about my faithfulness and it's not
[0:39] because of law it's not because of a
[0:41] rule book amen it's because we love one
[0:43] another
[0:44] because we as two persons have come
[0:46] together in a relationship and that
[0:48] relational bond is so strong that no
[0:51] matter what I wouldn't do anything to
[0:53] hurt her and she wouldn't do anything to
[0:54] hurt me
[0:55] now if a human relationship can do that
[0:58] amen why not a relationship with God
[1:00] that's why I do not understand people
[1:03] living in sin
[1:06] I understand making mistakes
[1:09] I completely understand making mistakes
[1:11] amen we make mistakes all the time I
[1:13] disappoint my wife all the time she
[1:15] disappoints me we have to make that
[1:16] right but how can we say we love God and
[1:20] continually live in a situation we know
[1:22] is contrary to his will and to Israel
[1:24] how can we say that oh I love God so
[1:27] much but I'm trampling all over his word
[1:30] which he is the word the word is also
[1:32] the person
[1:34] but my love for him should cause me to
[1:36] want to please him because I know God
[1:38] can be pleased
[1:41] sometimes I I feel like
[1:44] religion is still Among Us
[1:48] I feel like religion is still creeping
[1:51] in to where I can trample the
[1:54] Commandment of God and come and sing a
[1:57] song Amen and I'm looking at the church
[1:59] and I'm looking at my brother but I'm
[2:01] not realizing I have just stomped on the
[2:04] heart of God
[2:06] amen but a personal relationship won't
[2:09] allow me to do that if I fail him I
[2:12] can't wait to make it right and tell him
[2:14] I'm sorry
[2:15] because to me he's more than a book to
[2:18] me he's more than a theology to me he's
[2:21] more than the building he's more than
[2:22] the Fellowship of the Saints to me he's
[2:24] a person and that person is a personal
[2:26] God to me
[2:30] amen
[2:32] we've we've grown past
[2:35] legalism I pray
[2:37] we've grown past Church order keeping
[2:41] the conduct I want to grow past all of
[2:43] that
[2:44] I want to grow back into the place where
[2:46] I love him
[2:49] the person of the word is who I love
[2:52] I love him because he first loved me
[2:57] I love him because he gave himself for
[3:00] me and showed and demonstrated his love
[3:02] for me by redeeming me and then calling
[3:04] me to himself and then unveiling himself
[3:06] to me and that love relationship is what
[3:09] is binding me I want to be bound with
[3:11] the same change that Paul was bound by
