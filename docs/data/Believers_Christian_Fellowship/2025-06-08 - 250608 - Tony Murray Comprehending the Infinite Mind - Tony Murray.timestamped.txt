[0:00] Praise God. I'm a member of the blood
[0:04] wash band. I've been washed in the soul
[0:07] cleansing blood of the
[0:10] lamb. I was bound by chains of sin till
[0:14] one day the master
[0:17] came and made me a member of that blood
[0:21] wash band. Praise God. Praise God. I'm a
[0:26] member of the blood wash band. I've been
[0:29] washed in the soul cleansing blood of
[0:33] the
[0:34] lamb. I was bound by chains of sin till
[0:38] one day the master
[0:41] came. He made me a member of that blood
[0:47] washing and the word is working mightily
[0:50] in
[0:52] me. The word is working mightily in me.
[0:58] No matter what the circumstance or what
[1:01] I feel or see, the word is working
[1:05] mightily in me. Well, the word is
[1:09] working mightily in
[1:12] me. The word is working mightily in
[1:17] me. No matter what the circumstance or
[1:21] what I feel or see, the word is working
[1:24] mightily in me. Once more the word is
[1:29] working mightily in
[1:32] me. The word is working mightily in
[1:37] me. No matter what the circumstance or
[1:40] what I feel or see. The word is working
[1:44] mightily in me.
[1:47] Well,
[1:49] I'm an
[1:51] overcomer by the spirit of the Lord that
[1:55] lives within
[1:57] me. I'm an
[2:01] overcomer with the promise of a life
[2:06] eternally. But I once was lost in sin.
[2:10] And I had no strength within to resist
[2:13] the way that I had gone to leave the
[2:16] road. I was on. Jesus took away my sin,
[2:20] placed his holy spirit in, and gave me
[2:23] power to
[2:25] me. The word is working. The word is
[2:28] working might finally in
[2:31] me. The word is working might finally in
[2:36] me. No matter what the circumstance or
[2:40] what I feel or see, the word is working
[2:44] might finally in me.
[2:47] Will I say yes, Lord? Yes to your will
[2:55] and to your
[2:57] way. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes, I will
[3:03] trust you and obey.
[3:07] When your spirit speaks to me, with my
[3:12] whole heart I'll free and my answer will
[3:18] be yes,
[3:21] Lord. You may be
[3:23] seated. Will I say yes, Lord? Yes to
[3:30] your will and to your way. I'll say yes,
[3:36] Lord. Yes, I will trust you and
[3:42] obey. When your spirit speaks to me,
[3:47] with my whole heart, I'll
[3:51] agree and my answer will be yes, Lord.
[4:02] You deserve the
[4:05] [Music]
[4:08] gloryy and the honor.
[4:13] [Music]
[4:16] Lord, we lift our hands in
[4:22] worship as we lift your
[4:26] holy
[4:28] name. You deserve the
[4:35] glory and the honor.
[4:41] [Music]
[4:42] Lord, we lift our hands in
[4:48] worship as we lift your holy
[4:54] name. You are
[4:58] great. You do
[5:01] miracles so
[5:05] great. There is no one else like you.
[5:15] There is no
[5:18] one like you for you are
[5:24] great. You do
[5:28] miracles so
[5:31] great. There is no one else like you.
[5:41] There is
[5:43] no
[5:45] one
[5:46] else
[5:48] like you. You are
[5:52] great. For you are
[5:57] great. You do
[6:00] miracles so
[6:03] great. There is no one else like you.
[6:13] There is no one else like
[6:18] you. You are
[6:22] great. You do
[6:25] miracles so
[6:29] great. There is no one else like you.
[6:39] There is
[6:41] no
[6:43] one
[6:44] else
[6:46] like you.
[6:48] [Music]
[6:51] Amen. There's no one else like him.
[6:54] Amen. That's why it's so wonderful to
[6:56] talk about him, sing his praises. Amen.
[7:00] Hear the word preached about him. Amen.
[7:02] And that's what we come for, to know him
[7:04] better. Amen. Man, we're excited to have
[7:07] our brother Tony back. if you'll
[7:08] remember, he's here with us last year
[7:10] and he preached on a message on the
[7:12] purpose of time and it was such a
[7:14] blessing. And he didn't come to preach.
[7:15] He was just passing through as they were
[7:17] visiting Arizona. They stopped by and
[7:19] and uh after visiting him, we had some
[7:21] fellowship and I gave a little twist of
[7:23] the arm and he agreed. So he wasn't
[7:25] prepared. He wasn't planning and uh from
[7:27] that time on I I desired to have him
[7:29] back so he could take some time and
[7:31] minister. So he'll be preaching today
[7:33] and also Lord willing, Wednesday night.
[7:36] So, we want the brother to find a
[7:37] welcoming spirit here. Amen. We want him
[7:39] to be able to relax because we know it's
[7:41] not our brother, but there's a gift in
[7:43] there. Amen. And we're depending on God
[7:45] to work through that gift. But, Brother
[7:46] Bam told us we're 50% of the gift. So,
[7:49] we want to do our part to recognize that
[7:51] this is God's method for feeding his
[7:53] sheep. And we want to pull and receive
[7:55] from that channel today. And we just
[7:58] want to make it easy for our brother to
[7:59] where he can step aside and God can take
[8:01] over. Amen. We're going to work
[8:03] together. Amen. God, may God be praised.
[8:07] Amen. I don't know if you've ever seen
[8:09] the old crosscut saw where two men got
[8:11] on either side of the old saw and they
[8:13] would saw a log back and forth. Well,
[8:15] that's a give and a take. Amen. One
[8:17] person can't work that by themselves.
[8:18] And that's the preaching of the gospel.
[8:20] Amen. He's got to he's got to push and
[8:23] we got to pull and he's got to pull and
[8:24] we got to push and we're going to work
[8:26] together and see that the word of God is
[8:28] rightly divided and that our souls are
[8:30] fed today. Amen. We're just going to
[8:32] welcome our brother. Amen. I was
[8:34] notified we got a brother visiting from
[8:36] Singapore. Is that you back here,
[8:37] brother? God bless you. Amen. I didn't
[8:39] catch your name, but I'll I'll greet you
[8:41] after the service. God bless you very
[8:42] much. All the way from Singapore. Amen.
[8:45] Praise the Lord. From New Zealand, from
[8:46] Singapore. This is good day to be in
[8:48] church, friends. Amen. God must be in
[8:50] gathering for a special purpose. Amen.
[8:53] God bless you. We're going to welcome
[8:54] our brother and invite him with this
[8:56] song and pray that he can just relax and
[8:58] let God speak. Amen. God bless you.
[9:02] like, "And oh precious Lord, strip me of
[9:09] vain glory and
[9:12] pride. Please take
[9:16] away all that's
[9:19] left of self.
[9:24] Oh precious
[9:26] Lord, have
[9:31] preempidence, make me
[9:36] humble. I pray once
[9:41] more. Oh precious Lord, strip me of vain
[9:48] glory and pride.
[9:52] Please take
[9:54] away all that's
[9:57] left of
[9:59] [Music]
[10:00] sound. Oh precious
[10:03] Lord,
[10:08] every make me
[10:10] [Music]
[10:12] humble. I
[10:16] pray. Amen. Amen. and just appreciate
[10:20] the atmosphere here this
[10:22] morning. You know, when he's welcome,
[10:25] good things happen. Amen. We want it to
[10:27] be that way. Just that he would feel
[10:29] just welcome to be amongst us. And maybe
[10:31] there's something we can say as little
[10:33] study that I've felt in my heart to put
[10:35] together that maybe it'd be helpful in
[10:36] some way, just to strengthen us, to give
[10:38] us courage for the the journey that's
[10:40] still left ahead of us. We know that
[10:42] we're in the closing hours of time and
[10:45] um the the bride is coming into her own.
[10:48] Amen. We I believe we can read the back
[10:50] of the book and we can see that we win.
[10:52] Amen. And we can see that there's a part
[10:54] for the bride to be playing and uh the
[10:57] the the rest of the picture. Brother Ram
[11:00] says it's like a drama to the Lord, but
[11:02] we can see that it's coming to uh a
[11:04] fulfillment. It's coming to a climax.
[11:06] So, there's never been a more important
[11:08] day for the bride to stand. So, we just
[11:11] want to take heart and take courage from
[11:13] the the word that's been left with us
[11:15] that we can be all that he wants for us
[11:17] to be. Amen. So, God bless. You may be
[11:20] seated. I uh it's an honor and a
[11:22] privilege for us to be here. I don't
[11:24] really know how I wound up here again.
[11:27] Um it was really brother Chad's fault.
[11:29] He didn't tell you quite the whole
[11:31] story, but um I had invited him to come
[11:35] to New Zealand and next thing I'm coming
[11:38] here. So, it's uh we kind of backfired
[11:40] on me a little, but anyhow,
[11:43] um we're here and let's just trust that
[11:45] the Lord can can just inspire us to say
[11:48] something that would be helpful and a
[11:50] blessing to you. I want to bring
[11:52] greetings from uh folk back in New
[11:53] Zealand. Many people when they knew I
[11:55] was coming, they said, "Oh, pass on my
[11:56] greetings. Pass on my greetings." So, um
[11:59] there's people all around the world that
[12:01] they get to see you and they just wanted
[12:03] to say we love you in the Lord and we're
[12:05] all pressing on the same way. We've just
[12:07] been across to to Europe, through
[12:10] Germany, through Switzerland and the
[12:12] brethren there also just asked on to
[12:14] pass their love and greetings uh to you
[12:16] each one. So um brothers you might know
[12:19] brother Andy B, brother Good Road,
[12:22] brother Andreas Ringan just name a few
[12:24] they all ask that I would remember them
[12:26] to you and u so we do that this morning.
[12:31] Amen. I want to go and turn to a
[12:33] scripture right away and uh start on
[12:35] this little study. And um I brother
[12:38] Benham sometimes he would say we're
[12:40] going to have a Bible study today rather
[12:42] than it's maybe not so much preaching
[12:43] but it's just um brother says sometimes
[12:46] if we can we can find our place and our
[12:48] position in in the word then we we
[12:50] rightly know how we can have faith
[12:51] because we can identify our position. So
[12:54] hopefully we can do that a little bit
[12:55] together today and um that'll be a good
[12:58] thing. So maybe if we stand and read out
[12:59] of Romans
[13:02] 11:33. Romans
[13:07] 11:33 says, "Oh the depth of the riches
[13:10] both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,
[13:12] how uncarchable are his judgments and
[13:15] his ways past finding out. For who hath
[13:18] known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath
[13:20] been his counselor?" Now to verse 36.
[13:23] For of him and through him and to him
[13:26] are all things to whom be glory forever.
[13:30] Amen. Amen. Let's just
[13:32] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just ask
[13:35] now that you would just break the bread
[13:36] of life to us. Help us, Lord, to see
[13:38] both yourself and your purpose, your
[13:41] plan, and our part in it, Lord, as we
[13:43] would just go through these things this
[13:44] morning. Just encourage us. We ask in
[13:46] Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. God bless
[13:49] you. Hope you're seated. Now, brother
[13:51] Renham says the human mind is not
[13:53] capable to interpret the mind of God.
[13:56] And uh the subject I have called this
[13:58] morning comprehending the infinite mind.
[14:02] So it seems like uh quite a paradox
[14:04] because we can only think in human terms
[14:08] but uh he says in our humanity we can't
[14:10] actually comprehend the infinite mind of
[14:13] God. How can the little finite mind
[14:16] interpret the infinite mind of God when
[14:18] we can't even interpret one another's
[14:20] mind? And you notice that he's the only
[14:22] one that can interpret it. And he
[14:24] interprets it to whom he will. He or he
[14:27] reveals it to whom he will. It is
[14:29] actually part of his plan. In Jeremiah
[14:32] 9:20 uh 9:23 says, "Thus say the Lord,
[14:36] let not the wise man glory in his
[14:38] wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory
[14:40] in his might. Let not the rich man glory
[14:43] in his riches, but let him that glorieth
[14:46] glory in this, that he understandeth and
[14:49] knoweth me, that I am the Lord. Amen.
[14:52] For in these things I delight, saith the
[14:55] Lord. So, as I said, comprehending the
[14:58] inf infinite mind of God, it's a
[15:00] paradox. It both is impossible, but it's
[15:03] absolutely necessary.
[15:06] So, we we can't achieve it just by human
[15:08] thinking. And then he says in the
[15:10] scripture there, it's actually the only
[15:12] thing that's of real value. It's the
[15:14] only thing that's worth gloring in is to
[15:16] be able to say, I know him and he knows
[15:19] me. Amen. Everything else is going to be
[15:23] passing away. So it it's it's an amazing
[15:26] it's an incredible thing to me that the
[15:28] creator of heaven and earth takes an
[15:30] interest in us. He's mindful of us. And
[15:34] David says in the Psalms, "When I
[15:36] consider thy heavens and the work of thy
[15:38] fingers, the moon and the stars which
[15:39] thou hast ordained, what is man that
[15:42] thou art mindful of him?" That's right.
[15:46] And the son of man that they visited
[15:48] him, the creator of heaven and earth
[15:50] says, "I I am I am so interested in you
[15:54] that I want to come and live in you."
[15:58] Amazing. We'll get into that in a little
[16:00] bit. Paul when he knew this he said his
[16:02] one goal he says that I may know him and
[16:05] the power of his resurrection that's
[16:08] above all that he that he might have
[16:09] known in all his schooling he says if I
[16:11] can know him and the power of his
[16:13] resurrection that's worth more than
[16:15] anything else. Amen. And I'm so thankful
[16:17] for the message of the hour because the
[16:19] Lord has made known secrets to us.
[16:21] Things that have been hidden from the
[16:23] foundation of the world. He's making
[16:24] known his secrets. He's whispering those
[16:26] secrets to his bride. things that remain
[16:29] hidden to the rest of the world that are
[16:31] sealed. The seven seals, we say the
[16:33] seals are open, but they're not open to
[16:34] everybody. They're open to a select
[16:37] elect people. Amen. He's making himself,
[16:40] he's unveiling himself to us. And and we
[16:44] should be so thankful for that. We
[16:45] should just a grasp of it. Even
[16:47] fundamental things like who God actually
[16:49] is. Throughout all of history, how many
[16:52] people have actually known who God is?
[16:55] All through the church ages, most of
[16:57] them believed in a trinity. That's what
[17:00] they were taught. Even even the bride,
[17:02] the people that made up the bride, they
[17:04] they they were under that uh that cloud
[17:07] of the trinity. But in this last times,
[17:10] he's revealed to us who he actually is,
[17:12] what his name is. He is the Lord Jesus
[17:14] Christ. And when we see him, we start to
[17:17] see who we are. And we see the purpose
[17:19] that he has put us here for. You know, I
[17:22] think of Moses. He he would like to have
[17:24] known these things. is asking God, you
[17:25] know, tell me something about yourself.
[17:28] And the Lord says, well, I'll hide you
[17:31] in the rock and I'll put put my hand up,
[17:33] but so you can't see until I pass by.
[17:35] And when he passed by, he was surprised.
[17:39] He saw the back part of a man. And he's
[17:41] like, "What is this God?" Yeah. He said,
[17:44] "Well, tell me, what's your name?" He
[17:46] said, "I am that I am." Yeah.
[17:49] Now, if I was Moses, I'd have a lot more
[17:51] questions, a lot of things I want to
[17:54] know. He says, "But not yet, but it's
[17:56] going to be revealed." Amen. Amen. Now,
[17:59] just a bit of a bit of a background. We
[18:01] in our physical in our makeup as as the
[18:04] beings the Lord's made us. We have three
[18:06] parts. We know we're a physical body. We
[18:08] have a human spirit. And we have a soul.
[18:11] The the physical body is what we can
[18:12] walk around this earth in. But we need a
[18:14] human spirit, which is our human life.
[18:17] And that's where we can think. That's
[18:18] the that's the realm in which we think.
[18:20] But brothers talks about that the soul
[18:22] realm in the inside. That's the eternal
[18:24] part. That's the part that was in God's
[18:26] thinking right from before the
[18:27] foundation of the world where the sons
[18:28] of God shouted for joy. That soul realm,
[18:31] that's the theophony. Amen. But uh many
[18:35] people are searching for answers like
[18:37] science is searching for answers. The
[18:39] the churches are searching for answers.
[18:41] But if you're not looking in the right
[18:43] realm, you'll never find them. It says
[18:45] he's past finding out. If you look in
[18:47] the physical realm like science is
[18:49] doing, they they can discover many many
[18:51] great things, incredible things that
[18:53] they discover that God has made, but yet
[18:55] it's just physical and God's not there.
[18:59] It's what he did. It's what he made, but
[19:00] that's you can't find him there. And
[19:02] then people maybe like mystics and and a
[19:05] lot of spiritual uh aware people,
[19:07] they're looking in the spirit realm, the
[19:09] human spirit realm, and all you get
[19:12] there is frustration and confusion
[19:14] because we're complex and it's and it's
[19:16] a mess. That's right. And it and it's
[19:19] still temporal. But if you go to the
[19:22] soul realm and he reveals himself to us
[19:24] there, then that's where the union takes
[19:26] place. Amen. And outside that he will
[19:29] totally be past finding out. Now,
[19:33] brother Ram tells us that Satan is
[19:35] actually in heaven now accusing us
[19:38] before the Lord. He talks to God. Think
[19:41] about this. Satan talks to God. But
[19:43] brother Brandham says Satan doesn't know
[19:45] God.
[19:48] He talks to him and he accuses you
[19:51] individually before the Lord. But God
[19:54] brother Ram says he doesn't know him. He
[19:57] says, "The devil is as religious as can
[19:59] be, smart, scholarly, polished, but yet
[20:01] he knows no more about God than a rabbit
[20:03] would know about
[20:06] snowshoes. Cain talked with God." Yeah.
[20:09] But he didn't know him. Because this
[20:12] knowing him is relationship.
[20:16] Cain talked to God and he thought surely
[20:18] his sacrifice would be good enough
[20:21] because it was beautiful. was the the
[20:23] the best looking plants, the best
[20:24] looking flowers, whatever he could do
[20:26] that was just beautiful. And he did it
[20:28] for God. And he did it in sincerity in
[20:31] his heart. But it wasn't what God
[20:34] required. And to Abel, it was revealed
[20:36] to him that an innocent one had to die
[20:40] in his place as a substitute. Abel knew
[20:43] God,
[20:45] but Cain, he talked to God, but he
[20:47] didn't know him. Amen. Now God has
[20:50] always wanted to dwell with his people
[20:52] in the garden of Eden. He wanted to
[20:54] dwell among them and talk with Adam and
[20:56] Eve and walk with them in the cool of
[20:58] Eve. He he wanted to be have that
[21:00] relationship with them. But then man
[21:02] fell and then Israel came along and
[21:05] brother Reno explains to us that God
[21:06] wanted to dwell with them. He wanted to
[21:08] be in amongst his people but the people
[21:11] always wanted to turn to idols and turn
[21:13] back to other religions and and so
[21:15] forth. And so God couldn't dwell there
[21:17] either. And then came the Christian
[21:18] church. And the Lord wanted to dwell in
[21:20] his church. But down through the the
[21:23] church ages, they've always turned back
[21:25] to denominations, turned away from the
[21:27] word. Preferred to have something
[21:29] different than what God was doing. But
[21:32] right in the end time, he's going to
[21:34] have a bride. Amen. She's going to honor
[21:36] his word. She's going to reflect his
[21:38] word because she's going to have his
[21:40] very life. Amen. to Moses. God said,
[21:43] "Let them make me a sanctuary that I may
[21:46] dwell among them." And then Stephen when
[21:48] he's talking to the council, he said,
[21:49] "Solomon built him a house. How be it
[21:51] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[21:54] made with hands, as saith the prophet.
[21:56] Heaven is my throne and earth is my
[21:58] foottool. What house will you build me?
[22:00] Sayeth the Lord. What is the place of my
[22:02] rest?" And in Chronicles 2, 2 Chronicles
[22:05] 2:6 says, "But who is able to build him
[22:07] in house? seeing the heaven and the
[22:09] heavens of heaven cannot contain him.
[22:12] I'm thankful that Paul came along in sec
[22:15] 1 Corinthians 6:19. He says, "What know
[22:18] ye not that your body is the temple of
[22:20] the Holy Ghost?" Where does Almighty God
[22:23] want to dwell? In us. Amen. That's where
[22:26] he wants to dwell. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[22:30] which is in you are ye are of God.
[22:33] You're not of your own. For ye are
[22:36] bought with a price. Therefore, glorify
[22:38] God in your body and in your spirit
[22:40] which are gods. Amen.
[22:43] All right. So, brother Ram says now, he
[22:45] says, "God's right here." He says, "But
[22:47] let's see if we can see him." He and he
[22:50] goes through a little format that I want
[22:52] to go through this morning. He says,
[22:53] "Now, first I want to talk about God and
[22:55] his creation and then next God and his
[22:58] word and the next God and his son and
[23:01] the next God and his people. And let's
[23:03] see if we can see him."
[23:06] So I want to talk about a few things
[23:07] perhaps sciency things. Don't get too
[23:09] bogged down. There's not an exam at the
[23:11] end of this. Um so we just want to talk
[23:13] about some things but just from the
[23:15] point of view and for the purpose that
[23:17] we would understand how great he is. How
[23:20] great is our God? Because sometimes we
[23:23] go, "Oh, we're not we're not not
[23:24] involved in science. You know, we don't
[23:26] look at some of those things." But yet
[23:28] he actually had to have an interest in
[23:30] it to make it all. He had to think about
[23:32] how big he was going to make the
[23:34] universe. And we can't actually
[23:36] comprehend in our mind how big the
[23:38] universe is. He had to think about the
[23:40] smallest subatomic particles and how
[23:42] that they would function together to
[23:44] build atoms and molecules and elements
[23:46] and so forth. He had to think about all
[23:48] those things. So he probably doesn't
[23:52] mind if his bride takes a little bit of
[23:54] interest in his handiwork. So let's just
[23:56] do that for a moment. Okay. So he he
[23:59] everything in the universe that he made
[24:01] is incredibly complex and incredibly
[24:04] intertwined. Everything influences
[24:06] everything else just as we influence one
[24:09] another but all the stars influencing
[24:11] one another and all the galaxies
[24:13] everything is intertwined but it has to
[24:15] be uh that's why saying the infinite
[24:18] mind it takes the infinite mind to
[24:20] sequence these things to make it work in
[24:21] harmony. even the amount of energy that
[24:24] it took to form the atoms. Uh Albert
[24:28] Einstein he he came up with a famous
[24:31] equation E= MC² and it was a calculation
[24:34] to say how much energy it takes to make
[24:37] a certain amount of matter. And just to
[24:40] give a bit of an example, the biggest
[24:42] nuclear thermonuclear explosion that
[24:44] America ever did was a test called uh
[24:46] Castle Bravo done in 1954 at the Bikini
[24:49] Atole and it was a 15 megat ton
[24:53] explosion. 15 uh million equivalent to
[24:56] 15 million tons of TNT. So that's a big
[25:00] bang. But that explosion was only just
[25:04] big enough to make one can of Coke.
[25:08] you know the Coca-Cola you drink the
[25:10] amount of matter I think you call it 12
[25:13] flu ounces
[25:16] that uh 15 megat tons would make the
[25:20] atoms in one can can of
[25:23] coke what about us what about the world
[25:27] about the universe the energy required
[25:30] and science says that in the beginning
[25:33] nothing was actually created this is
[25:35] science this is not the Bible science
[25:37] says nothing was actually created
[25:39] because even the matter of everything
[25:41] that we see it was only a conversion of
[25:44] the energy which was already in the
[25:46] singularity
[25:48] the beginning that energy had to come
[25:51] from somewhere and it's just converted
[25:53] into physical matter but the energy is
[25:57] God
[25:59] they say it can't you can't create
[26:01] energy it had to be there and it just
[26:03] got solidified into and condensed into
[26:06] physical things that we can touch but
[26:08] the energy which is the power of the
[26:11] spoken word of almighty god was already
[26:13] there and even science knows that. Amen.
[26:16] All right. In uh in classical mechanics
[26:19] there's a conundrum called the threebody
[26:21] problem. And what it means what it is
[26:23] it's uh uh if you had three stars and
[26:26] they all are orbiting each other there's
[26:28] no way to mathematically calculate where
[26:31] at any time any of them are going to be.
[26:33] If you've got just two that's okay. they
[26:35] can they can you can work that out but
[26:37] the moment you got three the gravity is
[26:39] all pulling in such ways that you can't
[26:41] actually uh work it out the the science
[26:44] um definition they say it's deceptively
[26:46] complicated there's no formula that is
[26:48] able to predict the future positions of
[26:51] all three bodies so three stars how you
[26:54] stop them crashing together you can't
[26:55] actually work it out but God hasn't got
[26:58] just three
[27:00] stars he's got trillions upon trillions
[27:03] and trillions of stars
[27:05] and galaxies and black holes and dark
[27:07] matter all pulling on each other working
[27:11] in perfect harmony. It's
[27:14] incredible. And it's even it's more
[27:16] complicated than it sounds. And I hope
[27:18] it sounds complicated because it is. But
[27:20] it's more complicated than that. You
[27:22] know, we say the Earth here is spinning
[27:24] at six uh it's 1,000 mph at the equator.
[27:27] So it's 24,000 mi around. So we get one
[27:30] day because it rotates that fast at the
[27:33] equator. And uh incidentally, if it was
[27:36] a little bit faster or a little bit
[27:38] slower, we'd be in deep strife because
[27:40] if it went 10% faster, the wind speed
[27:43] would be up to 250 mph. That's a bit too
[27:46] fast. And if it went 10% slower, the
[27:50] daytime temperature would go up. I got
[27:52] it here in uh you're in Fahrenheit, so
[27:54] 170° Fahrenheit in the middle of the
[27:57] day. That's going to be too hot. and it
[27:59] would go down to minus60 degrees
[28:02] Fahrenheit at night just by going 10%
[28:06] slower.
[28:08] It's the balance is incredible. Amen.
[28:13] So here we've got the the earth spinning
[28:15] so that we get day day and night just as
[28:18] the Lord wants it. But the earth is
[28:20] orbiting around the sun once a year.
[28:23] Every 365 and a/4 days we go right
[28:26] around the sun. and we call that a year.
[28:29] But to do that, we've got to be
[28:30] traveling at the speed of 67,000 m an
[28:34] hour. And that's what we're doing.
[28:36] You're sitting right here feeling like
[28:38] you're sitting still, but you're
[28:39] actually moving around the sun at 67,000
[28:42] mph. That's 19 miles every second.
[28:47] So, but it's a lot more complicated than
[28:49] that because the sun, our sun and our
[28:54] whole solar system is also orbiting the
[28:57] center of our of the Milky Way and it's
[29:00] going round the Milky Way every 230
[29:03] million years. We do a galactic year, an
[29:06] orbit of the of the center of our uh
[29:09] Milky Way galaxy. But to do that, we
[29:12] have to be traveling at
[29:14] 514,000 miles an
[29:17] hour, which is 143 miles every second.
[29:22] But since the whole of our solar system
[29:24] is racing through space, so we just kind
[29:26] of think the sun's here and the Earth's
[29:27] going around it and the other planets
[29:29] like it's not like that. It's racing
[29:31] through space and all these other things
[29:33] are keeping up with it, circling around
[29:35] it. But it's a lot more complicated than
[29:37] that because our entire galaxy, the
[29:40] Milky Way galaxy, is hurtling through
[29:43] space at a speed of 1.3 million miles
[29:50] hour. So while we're sitting here, every
[29:53] second we've done 361
[29:57] miles. But to set that all in order that
[30:00] it all works in perfect harmony, it
[30:03] takes an infinite mind. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[30:06] He He had to plan it all. If we had
[30:09] infinite power and you wanted to put one
[30:11] planet in orbit around a star, you
[30:14] wouldn't be able to do it unless you
[30:16] also had the infinite mind. If you had
[30:18] infinite power to do it, you'd still
[30:20] need an infinite mind. And every
[30:22] satellite, there's thousands and
[30:24] thousands of satellites that man has put
[30:25] up around the Earth. There's not one of
[30:27] them that's in a stable orbit. Not one.
[30:30] Every single one of them has to be
[30:32] adjusted continuously to keep it in
[30:34] orbit because it's it's being influenced
[30:36] by all the other planets, being
[30:37] influenced by the moon. It's being being
[30:39] influenced uh by everything else that's
[30:42] out there in space, it keeps putting it
[30:44] out of its orbit. So, they have to keep
[30:45] driving it back into to keep it in a
[30:47] circular orbit. So, uh it's complicated.
[30:50] And I think the way that David said in
[30:52] the Psalms, "Great is our Lord and of
[30:54] great power. His understanding is
[30:56] infinite." Amen. That sums it up.
[31:00] None of this was actually a problem to
[31:02] the Lord. However, yeah, because if
[31:04] you've got infinite mind, he just
[31:07] sequenced it all. Just knows how to make
[31:10] it work. And I think to the believer,
[31:13] the fact that it's so complex, we can
[31:16] say only God could do this. But to the
[31:19] unbeliever, they say it is so
[31:22] complicated that nobody could do
[31:24] this. It really depends on your
[31:26] perspective. For a believer, we say
[31:28] that's Elohim.
[31:30] But to the unbeliever, they say it's
[31:32] just so impossible. Nobody could think
[31:34] it up. Nobody could actually control
[31:35] this in his mind. But uh we're thankful
[31:39] that we know him. Amen. In Psalm 19:1,
[31:42] it says, "The heaven declare the glory
[31:44] of God, and the firmament showeth his
[31:46] handiwork." Praise the Lord. I think the
[31:49] hymn, how great thou art, how great thou
[31:51] art uh sums it up. Oh Lord my God, when
[31:54] I an awesome wonder consider all the
[31:57] worlds thy hands have made. I see the
[31:59] stars. I hear the rolling thunder. Thy
[32:01] power throughout the universe displayed.
[32:03] Then sings my soul, my savior God to
[32:06] thee. How great thou art. How great thou
[32:09] art. Amen. Even the things that seem
[32:12] insignificant are are vitally important.
[32:15] I was reading somewhere recently they
[32:16] said that the planet Jupiter and I don't
[32:18] know if we've ever seen it. It's it
[32:20] seems very small in the night sky. And
[32:23] you think, well, it's so far away from
[32:25] us. What what value is it to us? Why did
[32:27] the Lord put it there? But science have
[32:30] discovered that the position that
[32:31] Jupiter is in its orbit around the sun
[32:34] is exactly the right position to protect
[32:36] Earth from asteroids and rogue comets
[32:39] and so forth. And they say if it was 10%
[32:42] closer to us, it would protect uh Venus.
[32:47] And if it was 10% further away from the
[32:49] sun, it would protect Mars. But right
[32:51] where it is, it protects Earth. Amen.
[32:53] And there some years ago, I remember
[32:55] there's a a comet uh or an asteroid
[32:58] called a comet, I believe it was,
[32:59] Schumark, a Levy, and it crashed into
[33:02] Jupiter. And you could actually see this
[33:03] this the impact marks from Earth. They
[33:06] could film it and and see it going. And
[33:08] the biggest part had 10 parts that hit.
[33:11] The biggest part made a firestorm on
[33:13] Jupiter bigger than the size of the
[33:15] Earth.
[33:16] So if it hit earth, there would be no
[33:18] earth. So I'm thankful that the Lord put
[33:21] it there.
[33:22] Jupiter is a good thing. But you know,
[33:25] even in our own bodies, there are things
[33:28] the Bible talks about uncumbly parts we
[33:31] bestow more comeliness. You know,
[33:33] there's so somebody might lose an arm.
[33:35] You could live without an arm, but
[33:36] there's there's bits and pieces on the
[33:38] inside of us that we don't want to see,
[33:40] but but we need them. Yeah,
[33:43] I I was also reading this says that we
[33:45] have in in our body something like uh 30
[33:48] trillion human cells and that makes up
[33:51] the the the bulk of our mass of course
[33:53] but the inside there we have lots and
[33:56] lots of bugs. We have up to 2 kilos of
[34:01] uh what they call microbial cells, fungi
[34:04] and viruses and uh bacteria. 2 kilos and
[34:09] there's 39 trillion of them in us. But
[34:14] we actually need them, but we don't
[34:17] really talk about them very much to one
[34:19] another. How are your microbial cells
[34:24] going? But we need them. And if he
[34:26] hadn't put that all in order, we would
[34:28] have nothing to digest our food and you
[34:30] know, all the different things we need.
[34:32] But see, uh, he's infinite in his
[34:35] thinking. Amen. Now, science itself uses
[34:39] uh complexity of of design as a marker
[34:42] of intelligence. If you hear um an
[34:45] archaeologist, he finds a stone tool and
[34:47] it's been it's been cut to a so that
[34:50] it's sharp. Oh, these are very advanced,
[34:53] you know, prehuman people people and uh
[34:56] they're very very clever. And then if
[34:59] you find one that's got a wooden handle
[35:00] on it, oh wow, these were intelligent,
[35:04] really intelligent people. And yet now
[35:06] when he finds and he discovers the
[35:08] genome, the DNA, human DNA, we have 3.1
[35:13] billion pairs they call uh of um base
[35:18] pairs in the DNA structure for
[35:22] humanity. And every one of your 30
[35:24] trillion cells, you have a map of the
[35:26] entire body. If you if you stretched out
[35:28] one of those the DNA in one cell, it
[35:31] would be six feet long. and he packs it
[35:33] all up and puts it in every one of the
[35:36] 30 trillion cells. It's it's got the M
[35:38] it's it's data code. It's written in a
[35:41] four uh digit code. Uh if you care I can
[35:45] tell you it's adenine, guanine, cytoine
[35:49] and thymine. They are uh they are
[35:52] chemical makeups that he makes up these
[35:54] codes and every one of the the letters
[35:57] if it if you like on the double helix of
[36:00] our DNA is made up of those codes. It's
[36:04] information. It's come from somewhere.
[36:06] Yeah. And science discovered this this
[36:09] great data store of information which
[36:11] tells about every part of your body and
[36:13] every function in your body. and they
[36:15] they look at that and they go, "No, I
[36:17] don't see any evidence of intelligent
[36:22] design." They need to get a mirror and
[36:25] say, "I don't see any evidence of
[36:28] intelligent design." It's both blind and
[36:31] insane.
[36:33] Yeah. And by the way, DNA, if you had a
[36:36] spoonful of DNA, it's so good at storing
[36:39] data that every movie ever made would be
[36:41] able to be contained in one teaspoon of
[36:44] DNA.
[36:46] Every movie that's ever been made in the
[36:47] history of the world. So, it's it's it's
[36:51] the perfect design for storing the
[36:53] information that that we need in our
[36:55] bodies. Amen. Great is the Lord.
[36:59] Okay. Now the big bang itself which we
[37:02] call creation. If you look back in space
[37:04] you can see the the background radiation
[37:07] that they say is a leftover from the
[37:09] original creation. And uh but if you if
[37:12] you looked at that and say okay there
[37:14] was a there was a huge bang but I don't
[37:17] know whether you've ever had a huge
[37:18] explosion. If you look at Elon Musk when
[37:20] he has his huge explosions there's not
[37:22] many usable pieces afterwards. It's a
[37:25] mess. He he calls them rapid unscheduled
[37:28] disassemblies. You know, I quite like
[37:30] that. Just everything's blown to bits.
[37:33] And unless the big bang was under
[37:36] infinite control,
[37:39] we would only have chaos. We we couldn't
[37:41] be here. He had to order all those
[37:43] things. Amen. It's finally tuned. Uh
[37:47] Steven Hawings you may have heard of he
[37:48] was uh a theoretical physicist in
[37:51] England and he said if the rate of
[37:53] expansion 1 second after the big bang
[37:56] had been smaller even by one part in a
[37:58] 100,000 million million it would have
[38:01] recolapsed before it reached its present
[38:03] size. Now I've not actually done the
[38:05] maths on that. I have to take his word
[38:06] for it but sufficient to say it's
[38:09] incredibly fine-tuned
[38:12] for it to work. On the other hand, if it
[38:14] had been greater by one part in a
[38:16] million, the universe would have
[38:17] expanded too rapidly for stars and
[38:19] planets to form. Amen. I believe that
[38:22] order in the universe is God's
[38:24] signature.
[38:26] Everything, Brother Ram says, the stars
[38:28] and the planets and the galaxies,
[38:29] they're still in order just exactly as
[38:32] he planned. In fact, he says he wrote
[38:34] our names in the stars. He was thinking
[38:36] of us billions of years ago when he was
[38:39] putting all that together. But you know
[38:40] when they find a um an artwork, a p a
[38:44] painting or something from years and
[38:46] years ago and it's been hidden in a
[38:47] cellar somewhere and they bring it out
[38:48] and they say they think this is a famous
[38:51] painting. It's been painted by somebody
[38:53] hundreds of years ago. And it's not so
[38:55] much the signature at the bottom that
[38:57] they take note of, but it's the it's the
[38:59] way that it was painted, the type of
[39:01] brush strokes, the type of paint that
[39:03] was used, the canvas it was done on. and
[39:06] they look at all those things, the frame
[39:07] even that they used and the type of wood
[39:09] and they can say, "Yes,
[39:11] this this was a a Rembrandt or this was
[39:13] a Monet or this was a Van Go." They they
[39:16] can look at those things and establish
[39:18] what it is. But when we see God's
[39:20] handiwork, we should be able to identify
[39:22] that. That's his signature. Amen. That's
[39:24] what he does. Praise the Lord.
[39:29] Amen.
[39:31] He was
[39:33] uh we should be able to see his purpose.
[39:36] All right. Now, just if we backtrack a
[39:38] little here to the beginning, brother
[39:40] Bram says in before the beginning, he
[39:42] said there was nothing. There was no
[39:43] light. There's no dark. There's nothing.
[39:45] I'll just read it here out of question
[39:46] answers 53. He said there was no light,
[39:48] there's no dark, there's no nothing. It
[39:49] just seems nothing. But in there is a
[39:52] great supernatural being, Jehovah God,
[39:55] who covered all space of all places at
[39:57] all times. The only thing that was there
[40:01] was the infinite mind.
[40:04] He wasn't even expressed in any form,
[40:06] but he was thinking. Amen. It's amazing,
[40:10] isn't it? He was there. There was
[40:13] nothing. There was no light. There was
[40:14] no atoms, nothing. But he was there. And
[40:17] all the power that he has was in him.
[40:19] Amen. He was no less awesome than he is
[40:22] now. But he was not even God.
[40:24] So we could say uh un you know
[40:26] comprehending the infinite mind of God
[40:29] but we can say that now because we can
[40:31] worship him but back then he wasn't even
[40:32] God because there was nothing to worship
[40:34] him. He was just the infinite
[40:36] mind and the first thing he created
[40:39] brother and sisters was angels and they
[40:40] worshiped him and then he became God and
[40:43] he's done and he throughout time he's
[40:45] done many things that we just can't
[40:46] comprehend and we won't be able to
[40:48] comprehend until we get on the other
[40:49] side. Job 37:5 says, "God thunderth
[40:52] marvelously with his voice. Great things
[40:55] doeth he which we cannot comprehend."
[40:59] Amen. But once again, just to give an
[41:01] understanding of of what this infinite
[41:03] mind is, the number of stars that we
[41:05] have in our our local galaxy, the Milky
[41:08] Way, they they estimate to be 400
[41:12] billion stars. 400 billion. A billion is
[41:15] a big number. If you had a a box that
[41:19] was uh 1 meter wide, so for you that's
[41:21] 39 in by 39 in and 39 in high, and you
[41:26] filled it with sand, you would have 1
[41:28] billion grains of sand. And so we have
[41:32] 400 of those, 400 billion stars in our
[41:37] local galaxy. And then the other
[41:40] galaxies, they reckon, this is an
[41:42] estimate, but they estimate there's two
[41:44] trillion galaxies, all with around 400
[41:48] billion stars as an average. And Psalms
[41:52] 1474 says, "He tellth the number of the
[41:56] stars, and he calleth them all by their
[42:01] names." Yeah, that gives you an
[42:04] impression of how great he is. looks up
[42:07] at a star in a distance g distant galaxy
[42:10] maybe in the mellan cloud and goes I
[42:13] know that one
[42:15] he he knows them all by their names amen
[42:18] we we have got nothing to worry about we
[42:22] have nothing to worry
[42:24] about all right now brother says maybe
[42:28] you're thinking this he says that
[42:30] science and education is of the devil
[42:32] okay so I'm talking about science and I
[42:35] want to explain why he says of the devil
[42:37] because we do science every day. You
[42:39] know, when you you do something and you
[42:41] learn something, you experiment with
[42:42] something. We we're doing science. It's
[42:44] discoveries. And it's not the
[42:45] discoveries that's wrong. It's the it's
[42:47] the false conclusions. The Bible calls
[42:49] it science falsely socalled. When they
[42:52] come to a
[42:53] conclusion, but they they're leaving out
[42:56] part of the information to come to that
[42:57] conclusion. And and I want to show you
[42:59] how that's done because there's five
[43:01] there's six fundamental questions that
[43:03] we ask. Can we do this without thinking?
[43:05] But it's a known thing. Uh if you're
[43:07] trying to uh evaluate something and it's
[43:10] um these are these are the six
[43:12] questions. Who, what, when, where, why,
[43:15] and how. So if you're wanting to
[43:18] evaluate something that that's what we
[43:20] would go through in each of those. But
[43:22] science are missing the who.
[43:26] You ask all the other questions, you
[43:28] know, what's happening. Oh, they talk
[43:29] about the big bang, when it happened
[43:31] 13.8 8 billion years ago and where they
[43:33] cannot tell but sort of here, there,
[43:34] everywhere and how. They spend most of
[43:36] their time on that. But who they
[43:39] deliberately ignore. And if you don't
[43:41] have the who, you don't have the why
[43:44] because it's irrelevant. Why are we
[43:46] here? Well, no one knows because we
[43:49] don't know the who. So, they've come up
[43:50] to conclusions without taking all of the
[43:54] available evidence
[43:56] um into use. And so, it misleads people.
[44:00] They think well I don't I don't I can
[44:01] never find God but he wants to be known.
[44:05] Many things I'll just quickly go through
[44:07] questions like how people in the world
[44:10] have these questions. What about world
[44:12] peace? Without him the who there is no
[44:15] world peace but with him he is the
[44:17] prince of peace. So, so you have to have
[44:20] the who um financial stability and cures
[44:24] for diseases and control of climate, the
[44:26] climate change and all these things or
[44:28] the big questions where do we come from,
[44:30] why are we here and where are we going?
[44:31] Without him, the who it's all
[44:34] irrelevant. Amen. All right. Even life
[44:38] itself, uh science doesn't know what
[44:41] life is. They they can't tell what life
[44:43] is because they're looking in the wrong
[44:45] region. They're looking in the wrong
[44:47] realm. They don't know where where life
[44:49] originated and they certainly don't know
[44:50] the purpose of life because life even
[44:52] this human life is not in the physical
[44:55] realm. It's spirit realm. There was a
[44:57] man Bill Bryson and he wrote a book he
[44:59] called it the short history of nearly
[45:01] everything. And he said in there if you
[45:04] if you pulled yourself apart with a pair
[45:06] of tweezers one atom at a time
[45:08] eventually you'd have a pile of atoms
[45:10] that was all you but none of which had
[45:12] ever been alive. Yeah. And it's quite a
[45:15] good way of thinking about it because
[45:16] just this physical is not life. Life is
[45:20] in this physical. When we say this is my
[45:23] body, it belongs to me. It's not it's
[45:27] not me. It belongs to me. And the
[45:30] prophet brings that out. The mei is on
[45:32] the inside. All right. And just as we've
[45:35] looked at the physical universe and it's
[45:37] complex, but then if you take the spirit
[45:40] realm, it's even more complex. And
[45:42] sometimes people say, "No one
[45:44] understands me." You hear people say
[45:46] that, "No one understands me." It's
[45:49] absolutely true. Just just get used to
[45:51] it. That's exactly true. No one
[45:52] understands you because we don't
[45:54] understand ourselves.
[45:56] We we can't understand ourselves. It's
[45:58] complex. Unless we hand our life into
[46:01] his care, it's going to be a disaster.
[46:03] Amen. There's two unseen powers that are
[46:06] both battling for you. Amen. And often
[46:09] in ways we don't fully understand. And I
[46:11] want to read here, brother Brennham has
[46:13] a lady come up in the prayer line and uh
[46:16] he he tells the things that I'll read it
[46:19] actually just how he says it. He says,
[46:21] "Now the very thing he that's here that
[46:23] knows your life. I see it goes way back
[46:25] to a little girl. I see you as a little
[46:27] girl. You were running from something.
[46:29] It was something chasing you. It was a
[46:31] dog. Now she's an older lady now, but
[46:34] he's looking back in her life with the
[46:36] gift. He can see she was chased by a
[46:38] dog. and it seems like you were coming
[46:40] from school or somewhere way long ago
[46:42] and it scared you. You've been nervous
[46:45] like all your life. Then brother Brennan
[46:48] prays for her. He says the lady standing
[46:50] here which she's tormented by an evil
[46:52] spirit that's trying to get her to
[46:54] commit suicide and do things that's
[46:56] wrong. But thou art here to remove this
[46:58] father. So Satan, you evil one that's
[47:01] tormented our sister, I adure thee in
[47:03] the name of Jesus Christ the living God,
[47:05] come out from the woman. And then he
[47:07] just turns to her and simply says, "Now
[47:09] run along and just be real happy. It
[47:12] won't come to you no more." Crazy.
[47:15] Just like that. It's like you can't work
[47:18] out how to do that. But we have to put
[47:20] our hand in his hand and say, "Lord,
[47:23] whatever my complexes are, whatever
[47:25] things I don't even know where they came
[47:26] from, deliver me from those that that I
[47:29] can be a fully functioning person in the
[47:32] body of Christ." Amen. Spiritually we
[47:36] are complex and the scripture says we
[47:38] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[47:40] against principalities and powers
[47:42] against the rulers of the darkness of
[47:44] this world against spiritual wickedness
[47:46] in high places.
[47:48] Amen. So when we know that we're in
[47:51] trouble, don't try and fix the problem
[47:53] from a human perspective. Just hand it
[47:56] over to the Lord because it's way beyond
[47:58] what we can do. Amen. Now, Satan, he
[48:01] cannot create. The brother brother tells
[48:03] us he just perverts what God has already
[48:05] created. And he always tries to mimic
[48:07] something that God is doing. He sees
[48:10] what God's doing and he tries to mimic
[48:11] it. He he normally tries when he hears
[48:13] what God's going to do, he tries to get
[48:15] in first. That's what he did in Garden
[48:18] of Eden. God had already told Adam to to
[48:21] multiply and replenish the earth. But
[48:23] Satan come in quickly and said, "Oh, I
[48:25] can tell you how this is done." See, he
[48:27] he knew about these things. So he's he
[48:29] gets in ahead to try and pervert it and
[48:32] do something that is a counterfeit. He
[48:34] says to Eve, "You'll be like gods."
[48:37] Well, they were like gods.
[48:39] He was trying to sell them something
[48:40] that they already had. And he's done
[48:42] that down through the ages with man-made
[48:44] religions and so forth and even just
[48:46] things of the world, offers people
[48:48] something. You know, when somebody takes
[48:49] drugs, they they do it because they want
[48:51] to feel happy and and for a moment it it
[48:54] does that to them. It just, oh, this
[48:56] feels great. but the crash afterwards.
[48:59] Yes. See, it's it's something that's
[49:00] false. It's fake. And we have to think
[49:03] about those things beforehand, not get
[49:05] tied up in it. But even in the secular
[49:07] world, not that this is wrong, but this
[49:09] but Satan is always trying to mimic
[49:11] something that God is doing. Uh man
[49:14] doesn't have the power of the spoken
[49:15] word yet, but the bride's stepping every
[49:18] day a step closer. But Satan has said,
[49:21] "Oh, that's a good idea. I'll give them
[49:23] the spoken word." Got it. Yeah. Hey
[49:27] Siri, Alexa, turn on the lights. See,
[49:31] it's it's it's a mimic. It's not
[49:33] necessary wrong, but it's just you see
[49:34] his nature. That's what he does. Man
[49:37] doesn't have an infinite mind. But he
[49:39] gives him the internet. He gives him AI
[49:43] to try and give him, oh, he doesn't need
[49:44] God. He's got a He's now got a
[49:46] counterfeit. Yeah. It's not right. It's
[49:48] not It's not correct. They make a lot of
[49:51] mistakes, but it's it's a counterfeit to
[49:53] try and take the place of God. The Lord
[49:55] gave the prophet visions that they could
[49:57] see things, that they could be inspired.
[49:59] But Satan gives people visions. Yeah.
[50:01] Puts it in the pocket. Oh, look at his
[50:04] vision, the television, whatever it is.
[50:07] But it's an imitation. And the end
[50:09] result is that people feel they don't
[50:12] have a need for God because Satan has
[50:14] given them everything, oh, that they
[50:16] need that they desire, but without him,
[50:19] it's all going to be a total loss. Yeah.
[50:22] So although God has displayed himself
[50:25] through his universe and through uh his
[50:28] creation, he never intended to reveal
[50:30] himself to us in that realm because it's
[50:33] through his word that he intended to
[50:34] reveal himself to make himself known to
[50:36] have a relationship was through the
[50:38] word. Amen. And he plans to do that
[50:42] personally to the elect. Uh Jesus says
[50:45] in Matthew 11:25, "I thank thee, oh
[50:47] father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[50:48] because there has hid these things from
[50:50] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[50:52] them unto babes." And it is the word
[50:55] that contains eternal life. It's it is
[50:59] it is the vehicle by which he imparts to
[51:02] us his life. It was always his purpose
[51:05] to pass on his life to to his elect. And
[51:08] he does it through his word. Jesus said,
[51:10] "The words that I speak unto you, they
[51:12] are spirit and they are life." It's it's
[51:15] an amazing thing that just a word
[51:18] spoken,
[51:20] it carries with it life. Amen. To me,
[51:23] that's that's an incredible thing.
[51:26] Brother says, "Before the foundation of
[51:28] the earth, the purpose of God was to
[51:30] share his eternal life with man."
[51:35] That's what he wanted to do. But before
[51:37] the beginning, he was thinking and I
[51:41] want to talk about what was he
[51:44] thinking. He's there alone and and he's
[51:48] occupying eternity with his
[51:51] thoughts. We can't say billions of years
[51:54] cuz there was no years, but it was
[51:55] billions of years. Okay? It was a long
[51:57] time. He was just there thinking. And
[51:59] many times, like in the middle of the
[52:01] night, if I wake up and I have something
[52:03] that I'm going to be doing the next day,
[52:04] I'll just I'll think. I I I'm still in
[52:06] bed. I'm not doing anything, but I'm
[52:08] thinking, how will I do this? And we all
[52:10] do that. And sometimes if you think long
[52:12] enough, you can work it out before you
[52:14] even start. But God couldn't do that.
[52:18] Because he already knew all things.
[52:21] So he didn't have to think on something
[52:23] long enough to work out how to do it
[52:24] because he already knew. He's infinite.
[52:26] He's omnisient. He knows all things. So
[52:28] he wasn't doing that. He wasn't thinking
[52:30] about how big the universe was going to
[52:32] be. I think uh science say now that the
[52:35] universe is 93 billion light years
[52:39] across. Well, he's actually got the
[52:41] whole thing under his control.
[52:45] But he wasn't have to worry about
[52:47] that. Brother Brham says uh that the
[52:51] earth actually between Genesis Genesis
[52:55] 1:1 in the beginning God created the
[52:56] heaven and the earth. He says, "Period."
[52:58] He said, "When he did it and how he did
[53:00] and how long ago that was." He said, "He
[53:02] doesn't tell us and it's none of our
[53:03] business." But he said, "But it was
[53:05] billions of years ago." And then you get
[53:07] to Genesis 1:2 and he says, "And the
[53:08] earth was was was without form and void
[53:11] and darkness is upon the face of the
[53:12] deep." He said, "Then he started on our
[53:14] current creation and that's when he the
[53:18] sun was already there, the moon was
[53:19] already there, the stars were already
[53:21] there, but he said there was a fog over
[53:23] the earth, darkness upon the face of the
[53:25] deep." He said the seeds were all of
[53:26] life of the plants were already in the
[53:29] in the earth. But he said let there be
[53:32] light and the fog cleared away and the
[53:35] sun came through and the plants came
[53:37] through to life and so forth. And he
[53:39] started from the earth and he remade the
[53:41] animals and so forth. Things that had
[53:43] actually even been here beforehand but
[53:45] had died out. Um and that's another
[53:48] story how that happened. But um he
[53:51] replenished the earth. You can't
[53:52] replenish something that wasn't
[53:53] previously plenished. There was
[53:56] something here before. But anyhow, he
[53:58] started on our present creation. Uh I
[54:00] suppose it would be uh 13,000 years ago.
[54:04] 6,000 years the creation thousand years
[54:06] he rested. Then we've had 6,000 years
[54:09] since the time of Adam until now. Then
[54:11] we have another thousand years which is
[54:13] a millennium. As far as God's concerned,
[54:15] the whole program takes two weeks and
[54:17] we're
[54:19] gone. That's pretty easy, you know. But
[54:21] he was a he's a master of extremes. He
[54:24] made things that are too big for us to
[54:25] be able to understand and he made things
[54:27] that are too small for us to be able to
[54:28] see. An atom is so small that it's
[54:30] smaller than the light wave of light. So
[54:34] you can never photograph it because it
[54:35] it fits in between the waves. You you
[54:37] can't actually get it to see it. And the
[54:39] the stars and so forth are so far away.
[54:41] The closest one is 4.25 light years
[54:44] away. And a lightyear is six trillion
[54:48] miles.
[54:50] So 6 trillion miles times 4.5
[54:54] uh you know
[54:55] 25 trillion miles away to the closest
[54:59] star. It's out of reach.
[55:02] No matter how fast your car is, it's out
[55:04] of
[55:04] reach. So he made things like that for a
[55:07] reason because I'm not you're not
[55:09] supposed to discover me like that. But
[55:11] he says through his word he's going to
[55:13] make himself known. I had written here
[55:15] the one just to give an idea one grain
[55:17] of sand has 10 quintilion
[55:21] atoms that's 10 with 20
[55:25] zeros. It's it's 1,000 trillion trillion
[55:29] atoms in one grain of sand.
[55:32] Wow. It's like why do they have to be so
[55:34] small? But he knows. Amen. But you know
[55:38] he didn't have to think about that. That
[55:40] wasn't what was on his mind. He knew how
[55:42] to do that. But he was thinking of you.
[55:44] He was thinking of me. Amen. Because
[55:47] what he wanted, he was lonely. He was
[55:50] alone. He didn't want to be alone. And
[55:52] that's why he said to Adam when he made
[55:54] Adam, he said, "Adam, it's not good for
[55:55] you to be alone." And Adam's like, "I
[55:58] know. I I get that." You know, he says,
[56:00] "But the the answer to Adam's loneliness
[56:03] was in him."
[56:05] Because he was made in the image of God.
[56:07] The answer to God's loneliness was in
[56:10] him. Amen. The bride that you see being
[56:12] expressed today is is that attribute
[56:15] that was in Jehovah God before the
[56:17] foundation of the world. Amen. Now from
[56:21] our perspective, we identify ourselves
[56:24] by our choice, by our decision. We say,
[56:26] "Oh, I I recognize this the truth. I
[56:29] choose to serve the Lord." But that's
[56:31] not really what happened because all it
[56:34] is is that we're the attribute that was
[56:36] in him before the foundation of the
[56:38] world. the word part of us can't help
[56:40] but respond to the word in due season.
[56:43] Amen. And that's what's that's why Jesus
[56:45] said all that the father have given me
[56:47] will come. That there's not any going to
[56:49] be left out. There's not any that's not
[56:50] going to come because uh it's just part
[56:53] of him that is being expressed in in
[56:55] this day. Amen. But you know back then
[56:58] the Lord wasn't satisfied just to see uh
[57:01] how's it going to be and who's going to
[57:03] come. He played the tape
[57:05] forward. He saw you. Amen. And he saw me
[57:09] before the foundation of the foundation
[57:11] of the world. Before there was anything
[57:13] here, he saw us and he said, "I
[57:14] predestinate them. I predetermined their
[57:17] destination
[57:19] before the foundation of the world."
[57:21] Amen. And the scripture says that that
[57:24] God is love, but to be love, he had to
[57:27] have a recipient of his love. That's
[57:29] right. And that was what he looked
[57:30] forward in time. He said, "That's my the
[57:33] recipient of my love is my bride, my
[57:35] wife." Amen. And that's why he was
[57:37] thinking of us. I believe he was
[57:39] enjoying the moment maybe for a billion
[57:41] years. Brother Renham says here, "Watch
[57:43] carefully now and see this. Before there
[57:45] was even a speck of stardust and he was
[57:48] known only as the eternal spirit, the
[57:50] bride was already in his mind." Amen.
[57:53] Yes, she was. She existed in in his
[57:56] thoughts. And what are about those
[57:57] thoughts? Thoughts of God, they are
[57:59] eternal, are they not? God is infinite
[58:01] in his abilities. So therefore, as God,
[58:04] he must be omnisient. And if he's
[58:05] omnisient, then he's not now learning,
[58:08] nor is he taking counsel even with
[58:10] himself. Nor is he even nor is he at any
[58:14] time adding to his knowledge. He's
[58:17] omnisient. He's never had a new thought
[58:19] about anything. Because all his thoughts
[58:21] he has always had and always will have
[58:24] and he knows the end from the beginning
[58:26] because he's God. Amen. And Jeremiah
[58:30] 29:11 says,"For I know the thoughts that
[58:33] I think towards you, sayeth the Lord.
[58:36] Thoughts of peace, not of evil, to give
[58:39] you an expected end." Amen. Expected
[58:42] end. That's predestined. Predestination.
[58:46] Amen. All right. Now, for the Lord to
[58:48] allow us to come here on free moral
[58:51] agency, he had to allow us to have a
[58:52] choice. And to have a choice, there has
[58:54] to be at least two options. That right?
[58:57] two options has to be. So because he is
[59:00] everything that is good, everything
[59:01] that's pure, everything that's lovely,
[59:04] everything that's
[59:05] honest. That's one end of the spectrum.
[59:08] He says, "But I've got to make another
[59:09] end of the spectrum. I've got to have an
[59:11] enemy. I've got to have somebody that is
[59:13] everything other than what I am." Amen.
[59:17] And that's why he allowed the sa Satan
[59:19] to
[59:20] be so that people would have a choice.
[59:22] So for the bride to have a choice so
[59:25] that he can say, "Well done, my good and
[59:27] faithful servant." Because if you don't
[59:28] have a choice, what what's well done?
[59:31] There has to be something. You had an
[59:32] option to go the wrong way and you go
[59:34] the wrong way. Brother Brandon when he
[59:35] was here and the Lord says to him and
[59:37] Danny Henry's uh prophecy, you know, you
[59:40] you've chosen of your own choosing my
[59:42] way. Well, you know, I think the Lord
[59:45] was pretty convincing to Brother Random
[59:46] that he go that way.
[59:49] He put a lot of pressure on him that he
[59:51] went that way. But he then commended him
[59:52] for his choice.
[59:55] And he tells the same about Moses and so
[59:57] forth. And the Lord sometimes has to
[59:58] deal with us and put us under a lot of
[1:00:01] pressure sometimes to get us to choose
[1:00:03] the way that that is his way because he
[1:00:06] has an eternal goal in mind for you and
[1:00:09] me. He says they have to be there.
[1:00:12] Heaven can't be the same without one.
[1:00:14] They have to be there. And sometimes he
[1:00:16] has to allow things that puts a pressure
[1:00:18] on us because if we're the gene seed of
[1:00:20] God, we're going to be there. But only
[1:00:21] the bride would make the choices that we
[1:00:23] make. Everybody else will either choose
[1:00:26] worldliness or organized religion.
[1:00:28] Brother says they're the two things that
[1:00:30] catch people. Worldliness or organized
[1:00:32] religion. But the bride shuns those
[1:00:34] things that we might take the word of
[1:00:36] the hour. Amen. All right. So when when
[1:00:40] the Lord had to make this uh as I say
[1:00:42] open the spectrum, he says, I form the
[1:00:44] light. I create darkness. I make peace.
[1:00:46] I create evil. I the Lord do all these
[1:00:49] things. Amen. And the reason that he did
[1:00:52] it because he had lots of attributes in
[1:00:53] him that he wanted to express. He wanted
[1:00:56] to be a savior. Somebody had to be lost.
[1:00:58] He wanted to be a healer. Somebody had
[1:00:59] to be sick. He wanted to be a comforter.
[1:01:01] Somebody had to need the Holy Ghost. He
[1:01:03] wanted to be a husband. He had a wife.
[1:01:05] He wanted to be one of many brethren and
[1:01:07] so forth. But all these different
[1:01:08] attributes in him, it required a theater
[1:01:11] of conflict. It it it required to have a
[1:01:14] a a war zone where he could bring these
[1:01:17] things out and where you could become an
[1:01:20] overcomer as I said and um the the Bible
[1:01:23] says that he knew that man is frail. He
[1:01:26] knew he says in Psalm 103:13 like a
[1:01:29] father he pityth his children. So the
[1:01:31] Lord pityth them that fear him for he
[1:01:33] knoweth our frame and he rememberth that
[1:01:35] we are dust. And then the scripture goes
[1:01:37] on to say that he saw that there was
[1:01:39] going to be no man that could actually
[1:01:40] be the savior. No man could actually be
[1:01:41] the interse. He had to come himself cuz
[1:01:44] no one else is going to be able to do
[1:01:45] it. He's got to come himself to bridge
[1:01:47] this gap. Amen. But when the enemy comes
[1:01:50] in like a flood, the spirit of the
[1:01:52] Lord's going to raise up a standard and
[1:01:53] that's going to be in you and I. The
[1:01:55] prophet tells us in the unveiling of
[1:01:57] God, he says uh he said it's the same
[1:02:00] God all the time down through the ages.
[1:02:02] He's just changing his form a morphe. He
[1:02:04] changes it. It's a great drama to him.
[1:02:08] He's just acting it out.
[1:02:11] We've got a part. We're We're just
[1:02:13] acting it out because this is not really
[1:02:16] who we are.
[1:02:18] We'll talk about that in a minute. The
[1:02:20] hardest thing that God ever had to
[1:02:23] do, I've talked about some difficult
[1:02:25] things. What's the hardest thing? What
[1:02:27] was the hardest? Which was the most
[1:02:29] difficult star? Which was the most the
[1:02:31] hardest thing that God ever had to do?
[1:02:32] The prophet said, "Man is God's agent."
[1:02:34] And the hardest thing that God has ever
[1:02:36] had to do was to get one mortal to
[1:02:39] believe another. It's it's God. Man is
[1:02:42] God's agent. That's right. You say, you
[1:02:45] know, when they saw Jesus, they just saw
[1:02:47] uh a little man, no beauty that she
[1:02:50] could desire him, right?
[1:02:52] But he was speaking the words of life.
[1:02:54] And some people caught it. And when the
[1:02:57] 5,4,988 walked away, he said to the
[1:03:00] disciples, "Are you going to go too?"
[1:03:01] Peter says, "To whom shall we go?" there
[1:03:04] has the words of eternal life that
[1:03:06] something had captivated them. They
[1:03:08] weren't even born again yet, but
[1:03:10] something had captivated them that the
[1:03:12] word that was being spoken, we we need
[1:03:14] that. We need that. Amen. And John uh
[1:03:18] 13:20 says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:03:20] you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send
[1:03:24] receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
[1:03:26] receiveth him that sent me." Amen.
[1:03:29] That's what the bride does. Catches
[1:03:30] that. We recognize although this is a
[1:03:33] man, he said a prophet, he was a man,
[1:03:36] but yet the words that he was speaking
[1:03:38] was the words of God. And when we
[1:03:40] receive that, when we embrace that, the
[1:03:43] seals are literally broken to us
[1:03:44] personally. Amen. That's when we come
[1:03:46] into that invisible union with Christ.
[1:03:49] And we see not only see him, but we see
[1:03:51] who we are and the purpose that he has
[1:03:55] for our lives. All right? So by design,
[1:03:58] revelation is the only way that a mortal
[1:04:01] can ever comprehend the infinite mind of
[1:04:04] Almighty God. But we battle every day
[1:04:06] being human. And brother Ram says that
[1:04:09] right up until the day of the rapture,
[1:04:11] we're going to still make mistakes,
[1:04:13] mistakes, do things. Oh, shouldn't have
[1:04:16] done that. Shouldn't have said that. Oh,
[1:04:18] wasn't thinking. It's like that
[1:04:20] frustrates me. Does it? You know, it's
[1:04:24] we're it's a pest house. he called it.
[1:04:26] See, so we've got that all the time. And
[1:04:28] often the devil will use those things to
[1:04:30] try and discourage us and disappoint us
[1:04:32] because we don't feel like eternal
[1:04:35] creatures. Just let's be honest, we
[1:04:38] don't feel like what we believe we are.
[1:04:41] Amen. We just feel like we're human.
[1:04:44] We can't even think in eternal terms. We
[1:04:47] we have would have trouble thinking in
[1:04:49] uh everlasting terms. If you think Adam,
[1:04:51] he lived everlasting life. every day was
[1:04:54] the was the same as the day before.
[1:04:55] Nothing deteriorated. If he even built
[1:04:58] something, it didn't rot away. It was
[1:05:00] just that was everlasting, which would
[1:05:02] be great. But we would have trouble even
[1:05:04] understanding that. But ever but eternal
[1:05:06] terms, God never had a beginning and he
[1:05:10] never has an end. Amen. We can't
[1:05:13] understand that. But the prophet says
[1:05:15] when we get to the other side, we won't
[1:05:16] be able to understand this. We He said,
[1:05:19] you won't even understand the concept of
[1:05:21] getting old. That's right. But here
[1:05:24] we're very much bound by that. But when
[1:05:26] we're over there in eternal terms, it's
[1:05:28] not even we we couldn't even understand
[1:05:30] him.
[1:05:32] Praise God. See, it's just a different
[1:05:34] way of thinking. Amen. God's
[1:05:37] understanding is unlimited. There's
[1:05:39] never a situation which he goes, "Oh,
[1:05:41] that's a bit too complicated."
[1:05:44] Oh, too many things at once. Don't all
[1:05:45] pray at once. It's too much. It It never
[1:05:48] can be. It's infinite. Yeah. no limit.
[1:05:52] But he put us here in an impaired form
[1:05:56] in in a in a in a hobbled form. We're it
[1:05:59] we're not actually who we are destined
[1:06:02] to be. That's right.
[1:06:04] If we were here in our theophony form or
[1:06:07] if we here even better still in our
[1:06:08] glorified body, his word could never be
[1:06:10] tested in us.
[1:06:13] It couldn't be because we would just
[1:06:15] automatically believe it. That's right.
[1:06:18] If you're thinking in eternal terms, it
[1:06:20] it just makes
[1:06:21] sense. Amen. But our lack of
[1:06:24] comprehension is not an oversight by
[1:06:26] God. It's by design. I I kind of I was
[1:06:29] reading there in Job in uh Eloh is
[1:06:32] talking about the ostrich and he's kind
[1:06:33] of using it as a bit of a type for us.
[1:06:35] And he says, "God hath deprived her of
[1:06:37] wisdom, neither hath he imparted unto
[1:06:40] her understanding." And to us, that's
[1:06:43] what he's he's impaired our
[1:06:44] understanding because uh he he's done it
[1:06:48] for a
[1:06:50] reason. Firstly, you can never work him
[1:06:53] out. You can never say, "Oh, yes, I I
[1:06:55] understand God. I can I can understand
[1:06:57] it all." I It reminds me, Brother
[1:07:00] Brennham uh was telling Brother Perry
[1:07:02] Green once about some scales that he had
[1:07:04] for reloading uh cartridge shells for
[1:07:06] his rifle. And uh he had this very very
[1:07:10] accurate sense of set of scales and he
[1:07:12] put two pieces of paper on the scales
[1:07:14] and they balanced. And then he took one
[1:07:16] off and he drew a little line on with a
[1:07:18] pen and he called it a scratch. And he
[1:07:21] put that on the scales again. And the
[1:07:23] weight of the ink caused the scales to
[1:07:26] come down. Just a scratch. But I just
[1:07:29] say that to think our understanding is
[1:07:31] like that scratch compared to on the
[1:07:33] other side the infinite knowledge of
[1:07:35] God. the whole weight of the universe
[1:07:37] may be on that side compared to the
[1:07:39] scratch. We can't work them out. Amen.
[1:07:42] So that's that's not no worth not worth
[1:07:44] doing that. But this life is just a
[1:07:46] shadow. In Isaiah 55:9 it says, "For as
[1:07:50] the heavens are higher than the earth,
[1:07:51] so are my ways than your ways and my
[1:07:53] thoughts than your way than your
[1:07:55] thoughts." Amen. This life, I said, is
[1:07:58] just a shadow, but it's not who we
[1:07:59] really are. The scripture in 1 John 3:2
[1:08:02] says, "Beloved, now are we the sons of
[1:08:04] God." Not we're going to be the sons of
[1:08:05] God. Now are we the sons of God. But yet
[1:08:08] it does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:08:12] But we know that when he shall appear,
[1:08:14] we shall be like him. For we shall see
[1:08:16] him as he is. If you think, imagine what
[1:08:20] what the Lord Jesus looked like on Mount
[1:08:22] Transfiguration. That was him in his
[1:08:24] glorified form. He he his garment shone.
[1:08:29] He his face was radiant. the uh Peter,
[1:08:32] James, and John fell at his feet as
[1:08:34] dead. That's actually who he is. When
[1:08:38] they saw him in just in his human flesh,
[1:08:40] that's not who he really was. When he is
[1:08:42] in his glorified form, that's who he
[1:08:44] really was. He says, "Now, when you see
[1:08:47] him, you're going to be like that."
[1:08:48] Amen. Wow. We don't feel like that.
[1:08:53] That's not how it feels. But you know
[1:08:54] what? When Jesus was here as a man, he
[1:08:57] didn't feel like God. He did not
[1:09:00] He felt like you and me. And even when
[1:09:03] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:09:05] bodily, he did not feel like he was
[1:09:08] Jehovah God. No. The Bible says Jesus
[1:09:11] wept. Brother Brandon says not only did
[1:09:13] he weep, he says of all the human
[1:09:15] emotions he manifested the most when he
[1:09:17] appeared as the son of man was this one.
[1:09:19] He wept
[1:09:20] often. Yet behind that weeping and that
[1:09:23] sorrow, there was still God.
[1:09:26] Amen. And as he was growing up, you
[1:09:28] know, when he was born a little baby, he
[1:09:30] didn't have uh the understanding of how
[1:09:33] he created the universe.
[1:09:35] But at as time went on and he read the
[1:09:38] scripture, when he started to grow up by
[1:09:40] the time he was 12, he knew who he was
[1:09:43] and he was disputing with the elders,
[1:09:46] asking what did David say this about
[1:09:48] Christ and why he's asking questions
[1:09:50] about himself. But between when he was
[1:09:53] born and the age of 12, there must have
[1:09:55] been a day when it struck him who he
[1:09:58] was. The amnesia of humanity broke away.
[1:10:03] And he looked out the window and went,
[1:10:06] "Wow. I created all this. He's not
[1:10:11] another person. That's him. I created
[1:10:14] all this." But if you'd asked him, "How
[1:10:17] did you create everything?" He would
[1:10:19] have said, "I don't know.
[1:10:22] I don't by the spoken word but other
[1:10:24] than that I don't know see he just felt
[1:10:28] like a man most to most people he just
[1:10:31] seemed like an ordinary man brother says
[1:10:33] in Jesus Christ the same yesterday day
[1:10:34] and forever 1957 the people of that day
[1:10:38] could not comprehend how him being a man
[1:10:41] could be
[1:10:42] God. How that an ordinary man without
[1:10:45] not even a forceful preacher. The Bible
[1:10:47] says his voice was not heard in the
[1:10:48] streets and there was no beauty we
[1:10:50] should desire him. He could not present
[1:10:52] himself maybe as a minister as an
[1:10:53] educated or smart could see and he said
[1:10:56] the son can do nothing in himself in his
[1:10:59] humanity. He was as weak as we are and
[1:11:03] he felt like that but yet he was really
[1:11:06] gone. You know, if if I was designing
[1:11:09] it, even when a man is born again, he'd
[1:11:12] be a
[1:11:13] superman. Wow. Because if we're born
[1:11:16] again, we're filled with the spirit of
[1:11:18] Elohim. Jehovah God is in us. Wow. He
[1:11:23] would, you know, strut around and what
[1:11:26] do you need? You know, just like
[1:11:28] anything, just ask, you know. See,
[1:11:31] that's how humanly we would think. And
[1:11:34] then him being the fullness of the
[1:11:35] godhead bodily, you'd say, "Wow, he
[1:11:38] would just always be like Mount
[1:11:39] Transfiguration." He would have walked
[1:11:40] down the streets and the scribes and
[1:11:42] Pharisees would have hidden away from
[1:11:44] him because of his glory. But that's not
[1:11:48] how it was. He had to walk as a man. He
[1:11:51] had to work. He had to hide himself when
[1:11:53] they were when they were trying to stone
[1:11:55] him. And when they said, "When are you
[1:11:57] going to come again?" He said, "I don't
[1:11:58] know. Only the father knows." Wow.
[1:12:03] seemed so finite, so
[1:12:06] human. Brother Rim says even when he
[1:12:08] went via Samaria, he he said he didn't
[1:12:10] actually know why he was going other
[1:12:12] than he'd seen a vision to go to the
[1:12:14] well and there was a woman going to come
[1:12:15] out, but he didn't know what was wrong
[1:12:16] with her.
[1:12:18] And he goes and he's he's there and he
[1:12:21] has to talk to her. He says, "You have,
[1:12:22] brother says, you have to believe me on
[1:12:24] this." But he says, "But he was talking
[1:12:25] to her to catch her spirit to find out
[1:12:27] what her problem was."
[1:12:29] Just like a prophet.
[1:12:31] Yeah. And when he was carrying his
[1:12:34] cross, he was too weak to carry it and
[1:12:37] he collapsed
[1:12:39] just like a human. You know, he did make
[1:12:42] a man that could carry the gates of Gaza
[1:12:44] once, but he didn't give that strength
[1:12:46] to himself.
[1:12:50] When Jes when he was here, the Bible
[1:12:52] says that Jesus did only that that
[1:12:54] pleased the father. And what that means
[1:12:56] is he deferred his natural thinking to
[1:12:59] his eternal thinking. He said, "Not my
[1:13:02] will but thine be done." Three times he
[1:13:05] prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, "Oh
[1:13:07] father, if it be possible, let this cup
[1:13:10] pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will
[1:13:13] but thine be done." Amen. Amen. And
[1:13:16] brother tells us that Jesus is God. He
[1:13:19] just says straight out. It's just Jesus
[1:13:21] is God. But he he was he was the uh
[1:13:26] eternal father but he said I come from
[1:13:28] God. He had to become flesh to fulfill
[1:13:31] the part and I return to God. Amen. But
[1:13:35] as a man he was tempted at all points
[1:13:37] like us. As a man he had to become an
[1:13:40] overcomer as an example for us. And then
[1:13:43] he died to make a way back for us. Amen.
[1:13:46] And as a man he conquered death, hell
[1:13:48] and the grave and rose again. But you
[1:13:51] know when he rose on the third day and
[1:13:53] ascended back he ascended to the
[1:13:55] father's throne and we'll talk about
[1:13:58] that just in a minute here. It was a
[1:14:00] position of father which is spirit but
[1:14:02] he was no longer limited to human
[1:14:04] thinking and it was then that the full
[1:14:06] revelation of who he actually was came
[1:14:09] to him. He did know in his mind who he
[1:14:12] was because that was revealed when he is
[1:14:14] here. But but when he rose again, the
[1:14:17] full revelation of who he was came to
[1:14:20] him. And it's that we see that in
[1:14:22] Revelation 1:1. It says the revelation
[1:14:24] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him.
[1:14:27] It was fully revealed to him. And he
[1:14:30] says to show unto his servants the
[1:14:31] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:14:33] and send sent and signified it by his
[1:14:36] angel unto his servant John. He's now
[1:14:39] telling us things. He's telling his
[1:14:41] wife, his bride, things that he himself
[1:14:43] didn't know. We're we're knowing things
[1:14:45] now in our flesh that he couldn't know
[1:14:47] in his flesh. It's true. The seal's open
[1:14:51] now. Amen. Things have been revealed.
[1:14:54] Brother Brandham says here in uh the
[1:14:56] Sardian church age, he says Jesus said
[1:14:58] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:15:00] unto my hands. He said all the power. He
[1:15:04] says then God is powerless if he's
[1:15:06] another person.
[1:15:08] For the Bible said, Jesus said after his
[1:15:10] resurrection, all power in heaven and
[1:15:12] earth, heaven and earth both was given
[1:15:15] into my hand. Amen.
[1:15:19] God is powerless if he's another person.
[1:15:22] I like the way the prophet says things.
[1:15:24] All right. And then uh in be not afraid
[1:15:28] he says he climbs so high into glory
[1:15:31] into power and glory until he sits on
[1:15:33] the father's throne and looks down and
[1:15:35] there's not even a sparrow can fall in
[1:15:36] the street without him knowing it. He
[1:15:38] knows how sick you are. He knows your
[1:15:41] doubts and your frustrations. We're in a
[1:15:44] terrible storm but don't be scared.
[1:15:45] There's someone watching you. He said
[1:15:48] which
[1:15:49] one? The one that broke the bread. The
[1:15:52] one that knowed Peter and called him by
[1:15:54] his name. The one that told the woman of
[1:15:56] her sins. The one that touched the hem.
[1:15:57] For the woman touched the hem of his
[1:15:59] garment and told her a blood issue had
[1:16:01] stopped. The one who perceived the
[1:16:02] thoughts of the mind. He hasn't laid
[1:16:04] down in the grave so he can't see you.
[1:16:06] But he's climbed into glory and he can
[1:16:08] see even a sparrow that falls in the
[1:16:11] streets. Revelation 18 says, "I am alpha
[1:16:15] and omega, the beginning and the end,
[1:16:17] say the Lord, which is and which was and
[1:16:19] which is to come, the Almighty." Amen.
[1:16:23] when uh Paul was on the road to Damascus
[1:16:26] as Saul and that light, the pillar of
[1:16:29] fire struck him down. He says, "Saul,
[1:16:31] Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And Saul
[1:16:35] says, "I see a pillar of
[1:16:37] fire. That's Jehovah God." That's right.
[1:16:42] Persecuting him. I thought I was serving
[1:16:44] him.
[1:16:45] He said, "Well, who who are you, Lord?"
[1:16:48] He says, "I'm Jesus." who they whom they
[1:16:52] are persecutors. Who was the Jesus that
[1:16:55] Paul was persecuting if that was the
[1:16:56] Jesus up there? Amen. It was Jesus in
[1:17:01] the people. Amen. That he was
[1:17:02] persecuting. That's right. And the
[1:17:04] prophet said, "It's the same today."
[1:17:08] Amen. That's right. What a great shock
[1:17:11] that must have been for the apostle when
[1:17:12] he said, "I am Jesus, the very one that
[1:17:14] he was persecuting." Why persecutest
[1:17:16] thou me? How could Paul then with all
[1:17:18] his intellect believe that this group
[1:17:20] that he was persecuting was the very God
[1:17:23] that he claimed to be serving? And he
[1:17:25] says, "And the same thing is happening
[1:17:27] today." Amen. Remember, he's still a
[1:17:30] pillar of fire. When he's on earth, he
[1:17:31] said, "I come from God and a return to
[1:17:33] God." All right. Now, to bring a
[1:17:36] balance, brother Ren says some
[1:17:37] interesting things. He says, "Now, Jesus
[1:17:40] could not be his own father
[1:17:43] and neither can Jesus have a father.
[1:17:48] Sounds like a paradox because he said
[1:17:50] then there'll be three gods because if
[1:17:53] he's got a father and the father is
[1:17:55] another besides him and the holy ghost
[1:17:57] is another one he's an illegitimate
[1:17:59] child but it's Jesus was Melkazedc
[1:18:03] remember he was a prefigure of Jesus and
[1:18:05] it said he was without father without
[1:18:06] mother without beginning of days or
[1:18:08] ending of life it was Jesus but Jesus in
[1:18:11] the man in the physical form could not
[1:18:13] be his own father but he was an
[1:18:16] expression a human expression or the
[1:18:18] image the Bible says in Hebrews of the
[1:18:20] invisible God. So God he came from God
[1:18:24] he he formed for himself a body as a
[1:18:27] blood cell in the womb of Mary. He then
[1:18:29] stepped into that body which was human
[1:18:32] and then he fulfilled uh the redemption
[1:18:36] through Calvary and then he said and he
[1:18:38] returned back to God again the eternal
[1:18:40] spirit. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:43] All right. And then he poured himself
[1:18:45] out as the Holy Spirit in the church.
[1:18:47] And he said, "I will not leave you
[1:18:49] comfortless. He's not going to send a
[1:18:51] different one." He said, "I will come to
[1:18:53] you. I will not leave you comfortless. I
[1:18:56] will come to
[1:18:57] you." In the uh Ephes Ephesians church
[1:19:00] age, brother says, "Now you'll notice
[1:19:02] when Jesus is walking alone in the midst
[1:19:04] of the churches, there's no one else
[1:19:05] with
[1:19:07] him. Neither indeed can there be, for he
[1:19:10] alone wrought her salvation. And having
[1:19:12] purchased her with his own blood, he
[1:19:14] owns her. He is her lord. Speaking of
[1:19:15] the bride and master, she gives him all
[1:19:18] the glory. And that glory he will not
[1:19:20] share with another. There's no pope with
[1:19:22] them. There's no archbishop with him.
[1:19:23] Mary, the mother of his earthly body, is
[1:19:25] not with him. He does not speak and turn
[1:19:28] to a father, for he is the father. He
[1:19:31] does not turn and give orders to a holy
[1:19:33] spirit, for he is God, the eternal
[1:19:35] spirit. Amen. And it is his life that's
[1:19:38] flowing and pulsating in the church
[1:19:40] giving her life. And without him there
[1:19:43] would be no salvation. There would be no
[1:19:45] life. And there because salvation is of
[1:19:47] the lord. Amen. So why does he say he
[1:19:50] sits now? The scripture says he sits on
[1:19:52] his father's throne. Because brother Rim
[1:19:54] tells us the father's throne is in the
[1:19:56] human heart. Amen. He's here as the holy
[1:19:59] spirit. That's where he sits now. He
[1:20:01] sits in his father's throne. But in the
[1:20:03] millennium he's going to sit on his own
[1:20:05] throne. And what that means is that when
[1:20:08] in the millennium we'll be in glorified
[1:20:10] bodies. Amen. He will be here. And the
[1:20:12] prophet says that we could shake his
[1:20:14] hand. He's going to be a man in a
[1:20:17] glorified body. And we're going to be
[1:20:19] men and women in glorified bodies
[1:20:21] forever more. Amen. And that's why it
[1:20:23] says he will sit on his own throne. It's
[1:20:25] not a different person. It's a it's a
[1:20:27] different uh
[1:20:29] manifestation that we're talking about.
[1:20:32] Amen. Amen. He says he he's now he's
[1:20:35] sitting on his father's throne. In other
[1:20:37] words, he's sitting in God's power in
[1:20:39] spirit now. But when he comes back,
[1:20:41] he'll sit on an earthly he'll sit in an
[1:20:44] earthly body. Hallelujah. On David's
[1:20:46] throne, he's sitting in the majesty of
[1:20:48] father. Now when we say father, it's
[1:20:51] Jesus. It's the spirit of God by the
[1:20:53] holy spirit in us. Now he's on the
[1:20:56] father's throne, right hand of majesty.
[1:20:58] We use the body name Jesus Christ who
[1:21:00] appeared the Holy Spirit which is God.
[1:21:03] Whatever you ask the Father in my name
[1:21:05] that'll do for I and the Father are one.
[1:21:08] Amen. He says, "And he will return in
[1:21:11] his body again and he will sit on a
[1:21:13] literal throne, a man that will eat and
[1:21:15] drink, shake hands. Glory." He says,
[1:21:19] "Now I've said all that to say this.
[1:21:21] Whatever we know about the Lord is what
[1:21:24] we should know about us because we are
[1:21:27] made in the image of God. Amen. Right
[1:21:30] from the beginning, the the way that he
[1:21:32] set it up, he made Adam and so forth and
[1:21:35] and it had to express Eve out of him. Uh
[1:21:38] was for a purpose that we would we would
[1:21:39] get the picture. When he was here, he
[1:21:42] had to walk the earth in a natural body
[1:21:45] and he had a human spirit that he could
[1:21:47] think in.
[1:21:50] is thinking, "I have a will. I'd like to
[1:21:53] live. I'd like to stay here. I've got
[1:21:55] friends. I'd like But I have to let this
[1:21:57] thinking go."
[1:22:00] That's right. To hear from his eternal
[1:22:02] thinking, the theophony. Amen. We have a
[1:22:05] physical body, but we also have a
[1:22:07] theophony. The body that's waiting for
[1:22:09] us. If we would die from here, we would
[1:22:11] go to that theophony. But then the
[1:22:12] prophet tells us that when the rapture
[1:22:15] takes place, the for those that are
[1:22:17] living here, the theophony comes to you.
[1:22:20] But when our theophony and this body
[1:22:22] combine, that's the glorified body.
[1:22:24] Amen. And that's what we'll be in
[1:22:26] forever more. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:22:30] often we fail to realize the power
[1:22:32] that's been vested in us by the revealed
[1:22:35] word of the hour. Brother Ren says here
[1:22:38] 1963, he cares to you. He said the
[1:22:40] visions on the platform in the audience,
[1:22:43] you are doing that yourself. He said it
[1:22:47] isn't
[1:22:48] God. If the prophet hadn't said this,
[1:22:51] you wouldn't believe me, right? But this
[1:22:53] is the prophet. He said, you are doing
[1:22:54] that yourself. It isn't God. It's you.
[1:22:57] God doesn't produce that vision. You do
[1:23:00] it yourself by your faith in a divine
[1:23:03] gift.
[1:23:05] That's why I say in this in the other
[1:23:07] realms things are taking place that
[1:23:09] often we we don't we don't fully
[1:23:11] comprehend. We don't understand. He says
[1:23:13] like the woman that touches garment he
[1:23:16] didn't know who she was or what was
[1:23:18] wrong with her but she did that herself.
[1:23:20] Amen.
[1:23:22] Faith in a divine gift. Faith in the
[1:23:24] revealed word of the hour. It has power
[1:23:26] in it. Amen.
[1:23:29] Now the prophet says the difference
[1:23:30] between him Jesus and you as a son he
[1:23:33] was at the beginning the word which is
[1:23:35] theophony the amorphe body he came and
[1:23:38] lived in that in the person of
[1:23:40] MelkiseDC. Later we never heard no more
[1:23:41] of MelkiseDC because he became Jesus
[1:23:43] Christ. MelkiseDC was the priest but he
[1:23:46] became Jesus Christ. Now he says now you
[1:23:48] bypassed that because in that form he
[1:23:50] knowed all things and you've never been
[1:23:52] able to know that yet. You came like
[1:23:54] Adam like me. You became from the
[1:23:56] attribute to the flesh to be tempted.
[1:23:58] But when this life is finished here,
[1:24:00] it's if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:24:02] dissolved. We have one already waiting.
[1:24:04] That's where we go. That's the word. And
[1:24:07] then the prophet says Jesus, he came
[1:24:10] right down the regular line. But it's
[1:24:13] interesting because he was the only one
[1:24:14] that came the regular line. You know,
[1:24:16] normally if you talk about something
[1:24:17] that's regular, that's what most people
[1:24:19] do. He is the only one who came the
[1:24:21] regular line because he said he came
[1:24:23] right down the regular line from
[1:24:24] attribute before the foundation of the
[1:24:26] world. His name was put on the lamb's
[1:24:28] book of life and from that he became the
[1:24:30] word the theophony that could appear and
[1:24:32] disappear and then he became flesh and
[1:24:34] returned right back again resurrected
[1:24:36] the same body in a glorified condition.
[1:24:38] But you bypassed the theophony to become
[1:24:41] a flesh man to be tempted by sin. Amen.
[1:24:44] And then he just goes on to explain what
[1:24:46] I did about if we pass from here. But
[1:24:50] you know when brother Rena went beyond
[1:24:52] the curtain of time and he saw those
[1:24:53] people that were there in their
[1:24:55] theophony, they were there in a
[1:24:57] different level of thinking than even
[1:24:59] the prophet was because he went there
[1:25:02] and they were telling the prophet.
[1:25:03] That's not normally the way around. The
[1:25:05] prophet tells the people, but the people
[1:25:07] were telling the prophet. Amen. Because
[1:25:10] they were in a different level of
[1:25:12] thinking. Amen. And he was there and he
[1:25:15] was in he looked at his hands. He says,
[1:25:16] "I'm young." He said he felt up. I've
[1:25:18] got hair.
[1:25:20] He could think
[1:25:22] in that realm. And he could work things
[1:25:25] out. He looked his body and he said,
[1:25:27] "Oh, I must have died. Must have been a
[1:25:29] heart attack." And he goes, "Oh no, the
[1:25:32] body's moving. I'm still alive." But
[1:25:36] he's thinking in this realm, but there's
[1:25:38] a human body back there that has human
[1:25:39] thinking.
[1:25:41] Amen. But it's still one person. And
[1:25:45] when we talk about Jesus being a man and
[1:25:48] he has eternal thinking, it's still one
[1:25:50] person. We're made the same way. Yeah. I
[1:25:54] think that's a great thing that we just
[1:25:55] have an understanding of these things.
[1:25:58] Now, I believe when we get to the other
[1:26:00] side and we're in glorified bodies and
[1:26:02] we have eternal thinking, we we actually
[1:26:05] have access to the infinite mind of
[1:26:07] Jehovah God, I don't think we will
[1:26:09] always uh live in that realm where we
[1:26:12] thinking in eternal terms. And I tell
[1:26:14] you like this, if I was saying to
[1:26:16] brother Chad, I says, "Uh, I was just
[1:26:18] thinking, Brother Chad," and he goes, "I
[1:26:22] know." Well, well, don't the Yes. You
[1:26:25] say, "Yes, the flowers do look
[1:26:26] beautiful." Huh.
[1:26:28] Have you ever wondered
[1:26:31] no there would be no point in
[1:26:33] fellowship. So it's not going to be like
[1:26:35] that. We're going to be so much like we
[1:26:37] are now. But yet we will have access to
[1:26:40] the eternal mind of almighty God. When
[1:26:43] Jesus came and he came back in his
[1:26:45] glorified form. He's walking to with the
[1:26:46] two on the road to Emmas. He was so
[1:26:49] human that they didn't recognize that he
[1:26:51] wasn't.
[1:26:53] Amen. He's just walking along, asking
[1:26:55] them questions unfolding. You know, when
[1:26:57] he was here the first when when he was
[1:26:59] here before the resurrection, he talked
[1:27:02] to them only in parables. All right?
[1:27:04] Only in parables. And now that he's
[1:27:06] risen from the dead and he's walking
[1:27:07] with them and they don't recognize them,
[1:27:09] he's walking along there and he's
[1:27:11] telling them things and he's he's
[1:27:13] expounding the scripture from the time
[1:27:14] of Moses and all the prophets, the
[1:27:16] things concerning himself. Those two
[1:27:18] must and says their heart was burning
[1:27:19] within them. They must like, "We've got
[1:27:21] to get this preacher to our
[1:27:23] church, man." He's just breaking it down
[1:27:26] who Jesus was. And it's like, "This is
[1:27:28] we've got to get him to come back, you
[1:27:30] know, until he did something that they
[1:27:33] recognized. It's actually him. That's
[1:27:36] who it was." And then they rushed back
[1:27:38] to tell the story. See, but as far as
[1:27:41] they were concerned for that whole trip,
[1:27:43] he was just a man, but he was actually
[1:27:45] the glorified Lord. Yeah. And when he
[1:27:48] met the disciples on the on the shore of
[1:27:51] Galilee and they were fishing and he
[1:27:53] says, "Uh, have you got any meat?" And
[1:27:55] they said, "No." He says, "Put the net
[1:27:57] on the other side." That should have
[1:27:59] been a little heads up to them. Like,
[1:28:01] uh, somebody else said this once
[1:28:04] before. They put the net on the other
[1:28:06] side. 153 fish. And they So, John says
[1:28:10] it's the Lord. They recognize. So, off
[1:28:13] they go. And they see him. But when they
[1:28:16] start talk, when they get there, he's
[1:28:17] cooking fish. That's right. He's having
[1:28:20] a cookup on the beach. Almighty God.
[1:28:22] Yeah.
[1:28:24] And he says, "Hey, don't don't lose the
[1:28:26] fish. Bring those other fish, too. It's
[1:28:28] very human interactions. Heaven is going
[1:28:31] to be great. It's going to be it's going
[1:28:33] to be human interactions, but there's
[1:28:35] not going to be any of the negative."
[1:28:38] But all of the positive. The the things
[1:28:40] that we enjoy are just going to be
[1:28:42] magnified. And the things that are
[1:28:44] negative, we'll never even remember
[1:28:46] anymore. Amen. I can't wait. I'm looking
[1:28:49] forward to that time. Amen. Okay. Now,
[1:28:54] God and his people, we must be
[1:28:56] transformed now. Is everybody still with
[1:28:58] us? Sorry, I'm probably going a little
[1:28:59] long, but I trust you're still with us.
[1:29:01] Amen. We want to see him in us. We've
[1:29:03] seen him in his universe. We see him in
[1:29:04] his word. We see him in his son. But we
[1:29:06] want to see him in us. Amen. And before
[1:29:09] we can do that, we must think as he
[1:29:11] thinks. Amen. He must transform us from
[1:29:15] the amnesia of our natural thinking to
[1:29:17] his eternal thinking. The Romans 12 uh 2
[1:29:20] says, "Be not conformed to this world,
[1:29:22] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:29:25] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:29:27] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:29:29] will of God." Amen. God has a program
[1:29:32] for bringing something from nothing into
[1:29:34] existence. And it starts off being a
[1:29:36] thought and then it becomes a word and
[1:29:38] then it becomes a reality. That's how he
[1:29:40] has always done things. And we must
[1:29:42] follow the same sequence. Firstly, we're
[1:29:44] in the thoughts of God. We're in the
[1:29:45] mind of Christ to begin with. And when
[1:29:47] then we must have the mind of Christ.
[1:29:50] And then we become the word made flesh.
[1:29:53] The prophet tells us. And that's when it
[1:29:55] says now thou must prophesy again. So
[1:29:57] we've gone from being just a thought to
[1:29:59] thinking his thoughts. The mind that's
[1:30:01] in Christ be in us. Now we start to his
[1:30:03] words in us and we start to prophesy
[1:30:06] again. Amen. And then the next the final
[1:30:08] stage there's going to be a
[1:30:09] transformation of this flesh and we'll
[1:30:11] be caught up to be with him. The
[1:30:13] physical realm is going to be changed.
[1:30:16] Amen. The prophet says in the power of
[1:30:19] transformation 1965, now that we have
[1:30:22] been saved as we are. So we say yes,
[1:30:24] we're saved. And now that we've been
[1:30:26] filled with the Holy Spirit as we have,
[1:30:30] we think we've arrived. But he says
[1:30:32] there's another there's another step.
[1:30:34] Now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:30:37] to be in us.
[1:30:39] We want to we need to think as he thinks
[1:30:42] that we might be transformed from the
[1:30:44] natural things of life to be brought
[1:30:46] back to do the perfect will of God by
[1:30:48] the transformation of God's spirit by
[1:30:50] his word. Amen. And that's what
[1:30:53] revelation is is catching the mind of
[1:30:56] Christ, the infinite mind of God. Job
[1:31:00] 32:8 says, "But there's a spirit in a
[1:31:02] man, and the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:31:04] giveth them understanding." We need that
[1:31:07] inspiration. Brother says, "We need to
[1:31:08] pray for revelation more than anything
[1:31:10] else to catch that revelation, you know.
[1:31:13] And if we've really given our hearts to
[1:31:14] the Lord, we we've been baptized in his
[1:31:16] name and we've done what he asked us,
[1:31:19] uh, repented of our sins and so forth,
[1:31:22] the amnesia of humanity starts to break
[1:31:24] away." Amen. It's not how we feel, but
[1:31:28] it's but the revelation of it strikes
[1:31:30] deep within us. I'm a CG of Almighty God
[1:31:35] being expressed in 2025.
[1:31:39] Wow, what a thought. He says, "You're
[1:31:42] standing completely." This is the
[1:31:44] invisible union. Brother Brennan
[1:31:46] preached this actually the day that I
[1:31:48] was born. The invisible union. You're
[1:31:50] standing completely. You never sinned in
[1:31:52] the first place.
[1:31:54] You can't get to that point with natural
[1:31:56] thinking. That's right.
[1:31:59] Yeah. This quote would be of no use to
[1:32:01] you if you're only going to use human
[1:32:02] thinking. That's right. You never sinned
[1:32:05] in the first place.
[1:32:08] God don't even know. I thought God was
[1:32:11] an infinite mind. He says the infinite
[1:32:14] mind of God does not know. That's right.
[1:32:17] About your sin if you've been redeemed.
[1:32:20] It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You
[1:32:22] never did it. You were accused of it by
[1:32:24] the accuser, but really from the
[1:32:26] beginning, you were predestinated to be
[1:32:28] a son and daughter of God. You're
[1:32:29] standing there washed. Your old book of
[1:32:31] divorcement is put away and it's dead.
[1:32:34] Absolutely out of existence. Even in the
[1:32:36] mind of God, you're the virtuous bride
[1:32:39] of Christ, washed in the blood of
[1:32:41] Christ. Amen. What a thing. We just got
[1:32:45] to accept that by faith because in the
[1:32:47] human mind, you can't get to that
[1:32:49] position. Amen.
[1:32:52] We need to accept what he has made us to
[1:32:56] uh to the praise of the glory of his
[1:32:58] grace wherein he has made us accepted in
[1:33:01] the beloved. In Philippians 2:5, this is
[1:33:03] the scripture I want to get to. He said,
[1:33:04] "Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:33:07] in Christ
[1:33:08] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:33:11] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:33:14] God." He didn't think it was robbery to
[1:33:16] be equal with God because he was God.
[1:33:19] But now he says you need to think like
[1:33:20] this.
[1:33:22] The mind that was in Christ be in you.
[1:33:24] Think like this. It's not robbery to say
[1:33:27] that you're equal with God. If you're
[1:33:29] actually part of God. The the bride is
[1:33:33] uh is not a creation of God. She's an
[1:33:36] expression of God. Amen. She she he was
[1:33:40] the only begotten son, but the bride was
[1:33:43] in him when he was begotten.
[1:33:46] So, she was also begotten of God because
[1:33:49] she was in him. And it's just an
[1:33:51] expression of God that is being made
[1:33:53] manifest. Amen. That's why we're joint
[1:33:56] ears with Christ. Joint just the same.
[1:33:59] He She can write the check, he can write
[1:34:01] the check. It's the same joint ears with
[1:34:04] Christ sitting with him in the throne.
[1:34:06] And that's why the prophet said, "Oh, if
[1:34:07] the church only knew its position." But
[1:34:10] I'm glad he said the next line. He says,
[1:34:12] "And it will one day.
[1:34:15] We're we're stepping right into the
[1:34:17] vision. Amen. Then the rapture will go
[1:34:19] when it knows what it is. And he says
[1:34:22] another the unconditional covenant that
[1:34:24] God made with his people. He says, "Oh,
[1:34:26] that makes the devil so mad." Sure does
[1:34:28] when you realize who you are. Amen.
[1:34:31] That's the revelation. That's the whole
[1:34:33] point. He's wanting to make himself
[1:34:34] known to us that we would come to find
[1:34:36] out that we are kind of his kind. Amen.
[1:34:39] We're becoming all that he is.
[1:34:43] God cannot marry a different species.
[1:34:45] That's right. It's got to be kind of his
[1:34:47] kind. Mrs. Jesus Christ is like him. And
[1:34:50] just as brother Ram preached, Christ is
[1:34:52] the mystery of God revealed. So the
[1:34:55] bride is part of the mystery of Christ
[1:34:57] revealed. It's we start to see if when
[1:35:01] we first read the Bible, I was talking
[1:35:02] to brother Chad about this the other
[1:35:03] night. If you when we first read the
[1:35:05] Bible, it's like two books. the old the
[1:35:07] Old Testament that's about Jehovah God
[1:35:10] and it's about uh the law and it's about
[1:35:12] Israel and then the ne the New Testament
[1:35:15] oh that's about Jesus and that's about
[1:35:17] grace and it's about the Gentiles but
[1:35:19] then when you read the Bible again in
[1:35:21] the light of the message when you first
[1:35:22] come to the message brother Ram says
[1:35:24] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ from
[1:35:26] cover to cover but then when you further
[1:35:28] read the Bible when the seals come off
[1:35:30] the book it's a love story
[1:35:34] oh all the way through It's him and her.
[1:35:38] Him and her. We start to see our part.
[1:35:41] And as brother says, well, mama, it's
[1:35:44] me. We see the reflection. This what
[1:35:46] he's talking about. It's not just
[1:35:47] talking about a God of history. It's
[1:35:49] talking about Christ in you, the hope of
[1:35:52] glory. Amen. The prophet says of the
[1:35:54] bride, it says the members of this
[1:35:57] virgin bride will love him. They will
[1:35:59] have his
[1:36:01] potentials. Wow. What are the
[1:36:04] potentials of almighty God of the
[1:36:07] infinite mind? Well, we can see quite a
[1:36:10] few quite a lot of evidence of the
[1:36:12] potentials being expressed. He says,
[1:36:15] "But she will have his potentials."
[1:36:19] Amen. Very good. Amen. The very thoughts
[1:36:22] of God expressed, that's the way he was
[1:36:25] in the beginning by himself. God dwelt
[1:36:27] alone with his thoughts. He'll never do
[1:36:28] that again cuz his thoughts are being
[1:36:30] made manifest. And that's why we're
[1:36:33] right here this day, God fellowshipping
[1:36:35] with his thoughts being made manifest.
[1:36:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, when Jesus
[1:36:42] came when he made his own fleshly body,
[1:36:46] it the the body itself was creation. It
[1:36:49] was taken from the creation. Mary ate
[1:36:52] food that was part of the creation and
[1:36:54] that formed his little body. And uh so
[1:36:56] brother says he actually became party to
[1:36:59] his creation. He he he made a pact with
[1:37:02] his creation by by coming in that form
[1:37:04] and he redeemed his creation at the same
[1:37:07] time. Amen. He became part of the dust
[1:37:10] of the earth to redeem the earth. Jesus
[1:37:12] came to redeem it back to the father. In
[1:37:14] order to do this, he had to become part
[1:37:16] of it. I've just went through that. He
[1:37:18] says from the very dust, the part that
[1:37:20] Jesus was himself being redeemed through
[1:37:23] him, all the attributes of God are
[1:37:25] redeemed with the earth. Amen. That's
[1:37:28] why he said he said it's fallen. It's in
[1:37:30] a fallen state. All of the whole earth
[1:37:32] is cursed. He says, "I'm going to become
[1:37:33] part of my creation so that I can even
[1:37:36] redeem the earth and make it back to how
[1:37:38] it was supposed to be." That's what he's
[1:37:41] done. Praise the Lord. Now, right now,
[1:37:44] we're getting close to the end. Just
[1:37:45] bear with me a little bit. But the the
[1:37:47] female attributes that were, say, in
[1:37:49] Adam to begin with could never have been
[1:37:52] expressed while they were in Adam.
[1:37:55] That's right. They were in there, but
[1:37:57] they were not expressed. But once Eve
[1:38:00] was taken from his side, and think of it
[1:38:03] like this, maybe she went out into the
[1:38:05] garden and she picked some flowers and
[1:38:07] she put them in a
[1:38:09] vase. And Adam goes, "That's
[1:38:13] nice. I never thought of doing
[1:38:17] that." Because it's something that was
[1:38:20] actually it was locked inside him, but
[1:38:21] it couldn't be expressed. And the Lord
[1:38:24] is looking if we're exactly the same in
[1:38:26] us. There's attributes in him, but he's
[1:38:28] looking on saying, "Oh, I like that. I
[1:38:30] like the way he did that." Brother
[1:38:32] Brandham, in the meeting, there was some
[1:38:34] people playing up in the background. And
[1:38:36] the Holy Spirit said, "You, whatever you
[1:38:38] say, that's the way it'll be." And he
[1:38:40] said, "I forgive you." And the Holy
[1:38:43] Spirit said, "That was the right thing
[1:38:44] to say." I like seeing that ex that
[1:38:47] attribute of me being expressed through
[1:38:50] the bride. That's what the Lord's
[1:38:51] looking for. Amen. And the third Paul is
[1:38:54] all about that. The manifestation of the
[1:38:56] third Paul. It was the creative power of
[1:38:59] almighty God now vested in a sinner
[1:39:01] saved by grace. Amen. He says it's no
[1:39:03] longer him. It's now her. Whatever you
[1:39:06] say, that's the way it'll be. Speak.
[1:39:08] Where do you want the squirrels? Said
[1:39:09] over there, there. There. When if
[1:39:11] brother Brendan never said a word, the
[1:39:12] squirrels would never come. But when he
[1:39:15] said, I'll have one there, there, there.
[1:39:17] He said little fish. Brother Brandon was
[1:39:19] not working himself up into some
[1:39:20] religious frenzy, you know, to to to to
[1:39:23] raise the life of little fish. It was
[1:39:24] not even in his mind. It was sovereignly
[1:39:26] given because now the thought of Jehovah
[1:39:30] God was in his his thinking. That the
[1:39:32] infinite mind was now being projected to
[1:39:35] him. And he he said, "Whatever you say,
[1:39:38] speak to little fish, give it back its
[1:39:39] life." He says, "In the name of Jesus
[1:39:41] Christ, I little fishy, I'll give you
[1:39:43] back your life." like that creative
[1:39:46] power, resurrection, miracle healing,
[1:39:49] control of nature, salvation or all
[1:39:52] things that only God can do. But now
[1:39:54] he's vested it back in his bride. And
[1:39:57] brother says those things which are
[1:39:59] manifest, which was seen in a temporary
[1:40:01] way, it it won't be done in a great way
[1:40:04] now until that squeeze comes on and then
[1:40:07] what you've seen done temporarily will
[1:40:09] be manifest in the fullness of its
[1:40:11] power. The bride is stepping right into
[1:40:13] that and we're right there right now.
[1:40:15] I'll read it to you just so you've got
[1:40:17] it here. He says, "Now their third
[1:40:18] Paul's been vindicated." I'm sure you
[1:40:20] know what it is. And he's talking about
[1:40:21] the manifestation of it here. Uh, just
[1:40:24] for the record, the third Paul is three
[1:40:26] parts. One was the opening of the word.
[1:40:28] The second is the manifestation of the
[1:40:30] spoken word, which is those five five
[1:40:32] gifts. And the third part is preaching
[1:40:33] to the souls that are in prison, souls
[1:40:35] that are in hell that never can be saved
[1:40:36] anymore. They've crossed the line. So,
[1:40:38] but this here what he's talking about is
[1:40:40] the manifestation of the third Paul, the
[1:40:42] the spoken word. He says, "Now, it's
[1:40:44] been vindicated. I'm sure you know what
[1:40:46] it is." Now, remember, there will never
[1:40:47] be any impersonation of that cuz it
[1:40:49] can't be. See, it cannot be. Now, it's
[1:40:52] just in it's in existence. And I've been
[1:40:55] warned of this that soon, right at this
[1:40:57] time now, it's just happened so it could
[1:40:59] identify its presence among you, but it
[1:41:01] will not be used in a great way until a
[1:41:03] council begins to tighten up. And when
[1:41:05] it does that, the the Pentecostals and
[1:41:07] so forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:41:09] that can be done. But when that time
[1:41:11] comes, when the squeeze comes down, then
[1:41:13] you'll see what you've seen temporarily
[1:41:16] be manifest in the fullness of its
[1:41:18] power. Amen. Now, I've heard people even
[1:41:21] the message say to me, "Oh, we we do
[1:41:22] that already. We speak things into
[1:41:24] existence. We speak things and prophesy
[1:41:25] and so forth." But you think Brother
[1:41:27] Brandham's ministry, he had he had many
[1:41:29] great miracles. The blind eyes were
[1:41:32] open. The deaf hear. dead were raised.
[1:41:35] Many so many thousands and th He didn't
[1:41:37] call any of that the third Paul. Amen.
[1:41:40] That's right. In fact, all of those
[1:41:43] things would be things that brother
[1:41:44] Brandham would have desired a blind
[1:41:47] person to get their he wanted that blind
[1:41:49] person to get their sight and he prayed
[1:41:50] for them. So, but all of the five
[1:41:52] manifestations, brother Brandham was not
[1:41:54] actually asking God, please give me
[1:41:57] squirrels. Please create squirrels. It
[1:42:00] it was not in his thinking. That's
[1:42:01] right. And brother Ram says, "You see,
[1:42:03] it was sovereignly given. It was
[1:42:06] sovereignly given." He said, "You speak
[1:42:08] and it'll be." So that's what's still
[1:42:10] before us. Amen. We're walking right
[1:42:12] into that. And uh another part there, he
[1:42:15] talks about the tent vision there. And
[1:42:18] we're having we chat about this the
[1:42:19] other night, too. But the tent vision in
[1:42:22] there, Brother Brandham talks about that
[1:42:24] on the on the platform is a little
[1:42:25] wooden building. And in the scripture,
[1:42:28] wood uh represents humanity.
[1:42:31] It's astounding to me that Jehovah God
[1:42:34] who covers all space of all places of
[1:42:36] all
[1:42:36] times he wants to unite with us while
[1:42:40] we're in this finite form while we are
[1:42:44] well we can't actually understand what
[1:42:47] why we we can't actually do very much
[1:42:50] but he says but it's in that form that I
[1:42:52] want to unite with you in the humanity
[1:42:54] he said they went in crippled and and
[1:42:57] all sorts of ailments individually into
[1:43:00] that little wooden building. They came
[1:43:02] out well. They came out changed. That's
[1:43:04] right. Amen. They came out sealed for
[1:43:08] eternity. Not just under the umbrella of
[1:43:10] the message, but an individual
[1:43:12] relationship with him, the word changes
[1:43:15] a life. And if we say, "Well, we're in
[1:43:17] the message, but is the message in us?"
[1:43:20] Brother said, "We're not to come
[1:43:21] together to talk about the message.
[1:43:22] We'll come together to get in the
[1:43:24] message." And the message is Christ.
[1:43:26] Amen. We want that to be in us. I've
[1:43:28] often said this at home, but if we were
[1:43:30] the last man standing, if we were the
[1:43:33] last one believing this message, would
[1:43:35] we still stand?
[1:43:38] If it's in us, to whom shall we go?
[1:43:40] There has the words of eternal life. We
[1:43:42] can't go anywhere because it's a
[1:43:44] reality. It's it's a revelation that's
[1:43:46] been made known to us.
[1:43:48] Amen. All
[1:43:50] right. He says, "Can't you see where
[1:43:52] we're standing? The life is in the grain
[1:43:54] again. Just exactly like the same grain
[1:43:56] that went into the ground which was
[1:43:57] Jesus. The same Jesus in bride form. The
[1:44:01] same power, the same church, the same
[1:44:03] thing, the same word. Amen. If we could
[1:44:07] just see that and he says he says we are
[1:44:11] his victory. That's right. Amen. So what
[1:44:15] what is the greatest victory that the
[1:44:17] Lord could ever have won? You know
[1:44:18] people say, "Oh, it was at Calvary."
[1:44:20] Well, Calvary, he purchased something.
[1:44:23] But something was on his mind when he
[1:44:25] was at Calvary. Amen. You know, if you
[1:44:27] were going to buy something, maybe a big
[1:44:29] item like a a car, and you you have a
[1:44:32] lot of money, you put the money down to
[1:44:35] buy the car. You've actually made a
[1:44:37] decision that the car is worth more than
[1:44:40] the money to you. That that's the
[1:44:42] decision you're making. And that was
[1:44:44] exactly the decision that Jesus was
[1:44:46] making on Calvary. See, what I'm
[1:44:48] purchasing is of more value than my
[1:44:50] natural life. I willingly give that
[1:44:53] because I get her. For the joy that was
[1:44:56] set before him, he endured the cross
[1:44:59] because he purchased your salvation. He
[1:45:01] said, "I redeemed her. She's mine and
[1:45:03] she'll be mine forever more. I've
[1:45:05] predestinated her." Amen. We become his
[1:45:08] greatest work. And just like Hosea in
[1:45:11] the Bible, he saw something in his wife
[1:45:13] that she didn't see in herself.
[1:45:16] And he brought her back. Amen. The Lord
[1:45:18] seen something in us that that humanly,
[1:45:21] if we're honest, we can't see in
[1:45:22] ourselves.
[1:45:24] But he's seen that and he's brought us
[1:45:26] back because we were part of him from
[1:45:28] the beginning. Amen.
[1:45:32] Amen. So that Ephesians 5:20 27 says
[1:45:35] that he might present to himself a
[1:45:37] glorious church, not having spot or
[1:45:41] wrinkle or any such thing, but that they
[1:45:43] should be holy without blemish. Praise
[1:45:46] the Lord. You know, he's so in love with
[1:45:49] his bride. Amen. He is. He loves you.
[1:45:53] He's waited an eternity for you. Amen.
[1:45:56] He's been watching you, preparing you,
[1:45:59] thinking of you throughout the
[1:46:01] eternities. In Zephaniah 3:17 as we
[1:46:04] close, he says, "The Lord thy God in the
[1:46:07] midst of thee. He is mighty. He will
[1:46:09] save. He will rejoice over thee with
[1:46:12] joy.
[1:46:14] He will rest in his love. He will joy
[1:46:17] over thee with singing."
[1:46:20] Can you imagine? The Almighty God is
[1:46:23] going to be singing
[1:46:25] because of his bride.
[1:46:28] Thank you, Lord. of all that he could
[1:46:30] have and all that he can create on his
[1:46:33] mind from before the foundation of the
[1:46:35] world was you
[1:46:37] rolling stars of his hand that wasn't a
[1:46:39] big deal but you were on his mind
[1:46:43] and brother Rom says then that our
[1:46:46] understanding will change from being
[1:46:48] partial realization to complete
[1:46:50] realization he says partial realization
[1:46:52] will be made perfect realization
[1:46:54] complete realization we here we've been
[1:46:57] looking through a glass darkly but soon
[1:46:58] it'll be face to face. We've been going
[1:47:00] from glory to glory, but soon we'll be
[1:47:02] right in the glory. In his glory, we'll
[1:47:05] shine. We shall be like him. One day
[1:47:07] we'll be changed in the atoms. We will
[1:47:08] put on immortality. We will be all
[1:47:11] swallowed up in life, he says. And then
[1:47:14] we will realize realization. Amen. Only
[1:47:18] then will we fully comprehend the
[1:47:20] infinite mind that's been thinking about
[1:47:22] us from before the foundation of the
[1:47:24] world. And you know, there's things that
[1:47:26] we we think, well, when I get over
[1:47:27] there, I'm going to ask him why did this
[1:47:29] happen or why did it happen? You know,
[1:47:31] we won't even have to ask because when
[1:47:34] you're thinking in infinite mind terms,
[1:47:35] it'll go, that makes a lot of sense. I
[1:47:38] know now why I had to go through that,
[1:47:41] you know, why why I had to be sick here
[1:47:43] or why this had to happen, different
[1:47:44] things. Oh, it'll just totally make
[1:47:47] sense because we're in a different realm
[1:47:49] of thinking. Amen.
[1:47:52] And you know I think it'll take eternity
[1:47:54] for him to
[1:47:56] unfold his glory. It will you know he
[1:48:00] every day there'll be something else you
[1:48:02] oh I did this and I did that you know if
[1:48:04] I make something in my workshop at home
[1:48:06] I I want to show my wife you know I get
[1:48:09] the one this is how I did it you know I
[1:48:11] think he'll be like that. He said, "Hey,
[1:48:13] come and maybe watch the film. You know,
[1:48:15] this is the beginning of creation or
[1:48:17] this is some supernovas. I smashed these
[1:48:20] things together and you know, we still
[1:48:21] see the evidence of it in space." Now,
[1:48:24] he he'll be interested in us being
[1:48:26] interested in him. Amen. He will. Just
[1:48:30] beyond the rapture, the king and queen
[1:48:33] are going to walk out together immortal.
[1:48:36] Then death is completely overcome. The
[1:48:39] final victory has been won when she
[1:48:41] walks out eternal. Amen. His master plan
[1:48:45] will have fully unfolded. Brother
[1:48:47] Brandham says the uh the three-fold
[1:48:51] purpose of God will be complete and he
[1:48:54] has finally fully expressed himself in
[1:48:57] his attribute bride. Amen. That's what
[1:49:00] he's doing right now. And you know what?
[1:49:02] Eternity is never going to be a lonely
[1:49:04] place ever again. But that's what he
[1:49:06] suffered. It's like I'm
[1:49:08] lonely. He's waiting for you. And Jesus
[1:49:11] prayed. The only prayer he prayed for
[1:49:13] himself was that they may be with me
[1:49:15] where I am. Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[1:49:18] so just a closing scripture, it says,
[1:49:20] "And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:49:22] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:49:24] words." Amen. That's what we want to do.
[1:49:26] Maybe a few musicians would come. We'll
[1:49:28] just sing this song. I just uh said to
[1:49:30] brother Blake about it. We're going to
[1:49:31] sing Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see
[1:49:35] now. who I am. If we've really caught a
[1:49:37] revelation, brother says, when you catch
[1:49:39] revelation, you're actually hearing from
[1:49:40] your theophony. You're hearing from your
[1:49:43] eternal part. Amen. That's what we want
[1:49:45] to do. And it changes us. It transforms
[1:49:48] us into his image. Amen. Maybe if you
[1:49:50] stand with us, we'll sing this song
[1:49:54] here. Oh, glorious victory. You've got
[1:49:57] the There we go. Verse one
[1:50:01] here. Amen. What a revelation.
[1:50:05] Oh, glorious
[1:50:09] victory. That day he set me
[1:50:13] free and he made my
[1:50:18] heart his very
[1:50:23] throne. My life is no longer mine.
[1:50:29] I'm a prisoner of love
[1:50:33] divine. And now I
[1:50:37] live to praise his
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] name. Who I am,
[1:50:47] Lord. Who I
[1:50:52] am. I can see now.
[1:50:58] who I
[1:51:01] am. I'm part of my
[1:51:05] savior. I'm part of his
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:10] word. It's the
[1:51:15] revelation. It's
[1:51:19] predestination of who I am. Who I am.
[1:51:26] Who I am,
[1:51:30] Lord. Who I
[1:51:34] am. I can see
[1:51:39] now who I
[1:51:43] am. A part of my
[1:51:48] Savior, a part of you.
[1:51:54] It's a
[1:51:57] revelation. It's
[1:52:02] predestination of
[1:52:08] Amen. Praise God. How many of you are
[1:52:12] seeing more and more who you really are?
[1:52:15] Amen. When he was going through the
[1:52:16] infinite mind of God and a mind that can
[1:52:18] control how many I can't keep up with
[1:52:21] the numbers. atoms and stars and speeds
[1:52:24] and swirling and moving and motion and
[1:52:26] fast and God can keep all of that. You
[1:52:28] think he doesn't have our life under
[1:52:30] control?
[1:52:32] Amen. We can rest in him. He foresaw
[1:52:34] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:52:36] we are just as secure in Christ as we
[1:52:38] have ever been. Oh, it does me a world
[1:52:40] of good. May this revelation become the
[1:52:44] only reality we see. That's my prayer
[1:52:46] when I hear this. May this revelation
[1:52:48] become the only reality, the chief among
[1:52:51] all realities. May this be cuz it'll
[1:52:53] take away all anxiety, all fear, all of
[1:52:56] those things that lock us down. All the
[1:52:59] deception of the devil and all the tools
[1:53:00] that he uses to manipulate and control,
[1:53:03] this revelation will take it all away.
[1:53:06] Amen. I appreciate our brother very
[1:53:08] much. Amen. I am looking forward to the
[1:53:10] youth meeting. We got a youth meeting
[1:53:11] coming up this afternoon at 6:00 p.m. at
[1:53:15] uh Brother Benjamin, Sister Amanda
[1:53:16] Seabolt. So we we welcome all the youth
[1:53:19] there to see you there. So be in prayer
[1:53:21] for that. And also for Wednesday, Lord
[1:53:22] willing, we we'll have brother Tony
[1:53:25] again. Amen. And I'm looking forward to
[1:53:27] it. Amen. What a blessing the word was.
[1:53:30] We want to invite Brother Keaton and his
[1:53:32] family around back. If you want to make
[1:53:33] your way around back, we'll have the
[1:53:35] baptism here shortly. And also I forgot
[1:53:38] one other visitor that I forgot to
[1:53:39] welcome but sister Tibia from Germany is
[1:53:41] here visiting with us too. So God bless
[1:53:43] you. So brother Tony they've come from
[1:53:45] all over the world brother. Amen. God
[1:53:49] bless you. Let's bow our heads
[1:53:51] together. Dear heavenly father we are so
[1:53:54] grateful Lord that we live in this
[1:53:57] generation in this time.
[1:53:59] Lord, for when you've told us that this
[1:54:02] is the darkest of all ages, Lord, when
[1:54:04] there's a complete blackout of apostasy
[1:54:07] in the
[1:54:08] churches, totally dark in the the
[1:54:10] Leodysian age. But God, you've chose
[1:54:14] this age to shine the brightest light in
[1:54:17] Satan's Eden when he's come to the
[1:54:19] pinnacle of his work of
[1:54:21] perversion. Lord, you are bringing the
[1:54:24] greatest revelation of all. You're
[1:54:26] revealing to us what was on your mind
[1:54:28] before the foundation of the world. What
[1:54:31] you were musing over the plan that you
[1:54:33] had had in your mind, the thoughts,
[1:54:35] Lord, that you wanted to fellowship
[1:54:38] with. And God, here we are, Lord. We're
[1:54:41] we're here manifesting what that thought
[1:54:43] really was. And for us, Lord, it can be
[1:54:46] so confusing sometimes and so
[1:54:48] overwhelming in the carnal mind. We can
[1:54:50] get so bogged down with life and so
[1:54:53] troubled, Lord, with so many conflicting
[1:54:55] thoughts and emotions within us and our
[1:54:58] humanity. But God, it's pleasing to you
[1:55:02] to reveal yourself even through this
[1:55:04] humanity. God, may you shift our
[1:55:07] thinking, Lord, from the human thoughts,
[1:55:09] Lord, to your mind, from the carnal to
[1:55:12] the supernatural, from the temporal to
[1:55:15] the eternal, so that we might take
[1:55:17] refuge, Lord, in your thoughts. we might
[1:55:19] take refuge in the eternal, Lord, and we
[1:55:21] might find our great victory, your
[1:55:23] victory in us and our victory in you. In
[1:55:26] those thoughts, Lord, that you've
[1:55:27] revealed in this end time. For God,
[1:55:30] you've opened up the mystery. You've
[1:55:31] taken away the veil. You've invited us
[1:55:34] into the back part of your mind, the
[1:55:36] thought you had of yourself before the
[1:55:37] foundation of the world, and we find
[1:55:39] ourselves there. Oh, what a consolation.
[1:55:43] What a victory. What a joy, what peace,
[1:55:45] what
[1:55:46] perfection is in that place. God, I pray
[1:55:50] that you would draw every one of your
[1:55:51] children into that place more and more.
[1:55:54] That we would stop looking around us,
[1:55:56] Lord, and and gaining all the
[1:55:58] information from what the senses are
[1:56:00] pulling in. But may you grant us
[1:56:03] revelation and may our understanding
[1:56:04] come from revelation of what reality
[1:56:08] truly is and what your plan really is
[1:56:11] and what your thought is and what it is
[1:56:14] you're truly accomplishing in our lives.
[1:56:16] God, may we walk out of these doors,
[1:56:18] Lord, more encouraged, Lord, more
[1:56:20] equipped, Lord, for the work that you
[1:56:22] have us to do, for your purpose in our
[1:56:24] lives. We love you. We thank you. We
[1:56:27] pray that you bless our brother Tony,
[1:56:28] that you would strengthen him again and
[1:56:30] encourage him once more as he comes to
[1:56:33] another fellowship, another meeting this
[1:56:35] evening. May you anoint him once again
[1:56:37] for that. And Lord, as we look forward
[1:56:39] to Wednesday, if there is a Wednesday,
[1:56:40] Lord, may you use our brother once again
[1:56:43] to feed us on the bread of life. And may
[1:56:45] these realities, Lord, become the
[1:56:48] greatest realities in our life. We
[1:56:50] commit ourselves to you. We thank you.
[1:56:52] We rejoice in what you've spoke to us,
[1:56:54] Lord. We ask your blessing now on it all
[1:56:57] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:57:01] Amen. God bless you, Brother Blake.

[2:01:06] Amen. God bless you all. Such a happy
[2:01:09] day for all of us who've watched Katon
[2:01:11] grow up. Seen him from the time he was a
[2:01:13] child and and he come to me Wednesday
[2:01:15] night and shared with me that he had
[2:01:17] felt the pull of God tugging at him and
[2:01:19] he wanted he wanted to identify with
[2:01:22] Christ. He wanted to give his life fully
[2:01:24] over and he wanted to be baptized in the
[2:01:26] name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:01:27] obedience to the word and to the call.
[2:01:30] And so it's a great priv privilege for
[2:01:32] all of us to be able to witness this.
[2:01:34] So, brother Keaton, because you want to
[2:01:37] identify with Jesus Christ and you feel
[2:01:39] the call and pull of God and you want to
[2:01:42] answer that call and respond and you
[2:01:44] believe Jesus Christ and his atoning
[2:01:46] work on salvation purchased you back to
[2:01:48] God and you want to identify with him
[2:01:50] and testify to the world of what God's
[2:01:52] done for you. It's a great privilege for
[2:01:55] me to now baptize you in the name of the
[2:01:57] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:02] Dear heavenly father, my brother Lord
[2:02:05] has responded to the call. You've
[2:02:06] pulled, you've drawn, and now he's come.
[2:02:09] He's come in obedience, Lord, to the
[2:02:11] instructions you gave, to the word that
[2:02:13] you've left. And God, I lay my hands on
[2:02:15] him as the apostles did of old. And I
[2:02:17] ask that you'd fill him with the baptism
[2:02:19] of the Holy Ghost. May you pour your
[2:02:21] life into him. And may you use his life
[2:02:23] for your glory. May you fill him. May
[2:02:25] you walk with him, walk in him, and may
[2:02:27] you use him to testify of this glorious
[2:02:30] word in this end time. I pray you hedge
[2:02:32] him about with your protection. May you
[2:02:34] shield him from all the fiery darts of
[2:02:36] the enemy. May he grow in grace and
[2:02:38] knowledge and understanding of you, Lord
[2:02:40] Jesus. And may he become your re your
[2:02:43] reflection in this body on this earth in
[2:02:45] this end time. I pray for it. And may he
[2:02:48] shine a bright light that others might
[2:02:49] follow and find their way to you. We ask
[2:02:52] it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Man,
[2:02:55] God bless you, my brother.
[2:02:58] What a lovely name. The name of
[2:03:05] Jesus. Reaching higher
[2:03:10] far than the brightest
[2:03:16] star.
[2:03:18] Sweeter than the songs they sing in
[2:03:22] heaven.
[2:03:26] All the saints
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:30] proclaim. What a lovely
[2:03:33] name. What a
[2:03:36] lovely,
[2:03:37] what a lovely name. The name of Jesus.
[2:03:46] Reaching higher
[2:03:50] far and then the highest
[2:03:56] star.
[2:03:58] Sweeter than the songs they sing in
[2:04:05] heaven. Let the saints
[2:04:10] proclaim what a lovely name.
[2:04:16] I
[2:04:18] have a
[2:04:23] father he for my
[2:04:30] Lord. And before even time
[2:04:36] began, my life was in his hand.
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:43] [Applause]
[2:04:45] He knows my
[2:04:52] name. He knows my every
[2:04:59] thought. He
[2:05:01] sees each tear that
[2:05:04] falls and he hears me when
[2:05:10] I have a father.
[2:05:14] I have a
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:20] father. He calls me his
[2:05:27] own. He'll
[2:05:29] never leave me.
[2:05:33] No
[2:05:34] matter where I
[2:05:41] go, he knows my
[2:05:47] name. He knows my every thought.
[2:05:55] He sees each tear that
[2:06:00] falls and hears me when I call. I have a
[2:06:08] maker. I have a maker.
[2:06:17] before my
[2:06:22] heart.
[2:06:24] Before even time
[2:06:28] began, my life was in his
[2:06:36] hand. He knows my name.
[2:06:44] He knows my every
[2:06:49] thought. He sees each tear that falls
[2:06:56] and hears me when I call. I have a
[2:07:03] father. I have a father.
[2:07:11] He calls me his
[2:07:16] own. He'll
[2:07:19] never leave
[2:07:22] me. No
[2:07:24] matter where I
[2:07:30] go, he knows my name.
[2:07:38] He knows my every
[2:07:43] thought. He sees each steer that
[2:07:49] falls and hears me when I go.
[2:07:56] Just
[2:07:57] beyond the
[2:08:01] veil, I long to see your
[2:08:07] face. Just to
