[0:00] As I travel through this pilgrim land,
[0:04] there is a friend who walks with me.
[0:11] He leads me safely through the sinkings.
[0:15] And it is the Christ of Calary.
[0:21] This would be my prayer, dear Lord, each
[0:25] day to help me do the best I can.
[0:31] For I need thy light to guide me day and
[0:35] night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
[0:42] Jesus,
[0:44] hold my hand.
[0:46] I need
[0:49] thee every hour
[0:51] [Music]
[0:52] through
[0:54] this pilgrim land.
[0:57] Protect me by thy power.
[1:03] Hear my people.
[1:07] Oh Lord,
[1:09] look down on me.
[1:12] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[1:16] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[1:20] hand.
[1:23] Let me travel in the light divine that I
[1:28] may see the blessed way.
[1:33] Keep me that I may be holy. Thine in
[1:38] sing redemption song. Someday
[1:43] I will be a soldier brave and true and
[1:48] ever firmly. Take a stand.
[1:52] And as I onward go and daily meet the f
[1:58] blessed Jesus
[2:00] hold my hand.
[2:03] Oh Jesus
[2:05] hold my hand
[2:08] I need
[2:10] thee every hour
[2:13] through
[2:15] this pilgrim land.
[2:18] Protect me by thy power.
[2:22] [Music]
[2:24] Hear my people.
[2:28] Oh Lord,
[2:30] look down on me.
[2:33] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[2:37] meet you there. Blessed Jesus,
[2:40] hold my hand.
[2:44] When I wander through the valley, dim or
[2:48] the setting of the sun,
[2:54] lead me faithfully to a land of rest, if
[2:58] by a crown of life I've won.
[3:04] I have put my faith in thee, dear Lord,
[3:08] that I may reach the golden strand.
[3:13] There's no other friend on whom I can
[3:17] depend. Blessed Jesus,
[3:20] hold my hand.
[3:24] And Jesus,
[3:26] hold my hand.
[3:28] I need
[3:31] thee every hour.
[3:35] through this pilgrim land.
[3:38] Protect me by thy power.
[3:44] Here my people,
[3:48] oh Lord,
[3:50] look down on me.
[3:53] And when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[3:57] meet you there. Blessed Jesus,
[4:01] hold my hand for us. One more time. Oh
[4:04] Jesus,
[4:06] hold my hand.
[4:09] I need
[4:11] thee every hour
[4:14] through
[4:16] this pilgrim land.
[4:19] Protect me by thy power.
[4:24] Here my people,
[4:29] oh Lord,
[4:31] look down on me.
[4:34] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[4:38] you there. Blessed Jesus,
[4:41] hold my hand.
[4:44] Oh, he's everything.
[4:47] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[4:53] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[4:57] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[5:02] He's everything
[5:04] to me.
[5:07] Oh, he's everything.
[5:10] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[5:16] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[5:20] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[5:24] He's everything
[5:27] to me. One more time.
[5:29] Oh, he's everything.
[5:33] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[5:38] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[5:42] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[5:47] He's everything
[5:49] to me.
[5:51] And I've got a revelation
[5:56] of predestination.
[5:58] [Music]
[6:01] I've got a revelation.
[6:04] [Music]
[6:05] God is my father
[6:09] and I know where
[6:13] I came from. It tells me where
[6:18] I'm going.
[6:20] and the gates of hell shall never
[6:24] prevail
[6:26] against
[6:28] it. Oh, I've got a revelation
[6:35] of predestination.
[6:40] I've got a revelation.
[6:45] God is my father.
[6:49] And it tells me where
[6:53] I came from. It tells me where
[6:58] I'm going.
[7:00] And the gates of hell shall never
[7:04] prevail
[7:06] against
[7:09] it.
[7:10] Give me new strength, I pray,
[7:16] to face another day.
[7:20] Give me courage to press on
[7:25] and keep me from all wrong.
[7:30] Help me live my life for others.
[7:35] As you live your life for me,
[7:40] as you walked your way to Calvary,
[7:44] you took my sins and carried me.
[7:50] You're my Jesus,
[7:56] my savior.
[8:00] If there is anything I've held back from
[8:04] you, upon my knees I bring. You're my
[8:11] Jesus,
[8:15] my master.
[8:20] As I give my life
[8:23] to you, may it be pleasing in your
[8:27] sight,
[8:29] oh Lord.
[8:34] You're the one who goes before me.
[8:39] You're the one who guides my path.
[8:43] If I surrender my ambition
[8:48] and seek your will to be my task,
[8:53] may your spirit move within me
[8:58] and use me Lord today.
[9:03] till the harvest will be over.
[9:08] But let me labor till that day.
[9:13] You're my Jesus
[9:17] [Music]
[9:20] my savior.
[9:24] If there is anything I felt back from
[9:28] you, upon my knees I bring. You're my
[9:35] Jesus,
[9:39] my master.
[9:44] As I give my life from you to you, may
[9:49] it be pleasing in your sight,
[9:54] oh Lord.
[9:56] As brother Gabriel would come sing, I
[9:58] love him. I
[10:02] love him.
[10:06] I
[10:09] love him.
[10:13] Because
[10:17] he first
[10:20] loved
[10:21] me
[10:27] and
[10:29] her
[10:32] just my
[10:35] sation
[10:40] [Music]
[10:42] on
[10:48] [Music]
[10:52] the chorus one more time.
[10:55] I
[10:58] love him.
[11:03] I
[11:06] love him
[11:10] because
[11:13] he first
[11:16] loved
[11:18] me
[11:22] [Music]
[11:24] and
[11:26] her
[11:28] just my
[11:31] Salvation
[11:39] on
[11:41] Calary.
[11:43] [Music]
[11:52] Amen.
[11:54] God bless you all this evening. Good to
[11:57] see uh each and every one of you. And uh
[12:00] if it's okay, we'll just uh try to be
[12:04] mindful of the evening and Wednesday
[12:06] night. And so if we could get right into
[12:08] the scriptures, I'd like to read uh
[12:10] Hebrews
[12:13] uh the 4th chapter
[12:21] and um
[12:26] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[12:32] For the word of the Lord is quick and
[12:35] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[12:38] sword,
[12:40] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[12:43] of soul and spirit,
[12:46] and of the joints and marorrow, and is a
[12:49] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[12:52] the heart.
[12:54] Neither is there any creature that is
[12:56] not manifest in his sight, but all
[12:59] things are naked and opened unto the
[13:01] eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[13:05] Seeing then that we have a great high
[13:08] priest that is passed into the heavens,
[13:13] Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast
[13:17] our profession.
[13:20] For we have not a high priest, which
[13:22] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[13:25] our infirmities,
[13:27] but was in all points tempted like as we
[13:30] are, yet without sin.
[13:33] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[13:35] throne of grace, that we may obtain
[13:37] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[13:41] need. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in
[13:44] a word of prayer.
[13:46] Precious Lord, we truly
[13:49] count it a privilege this evening, Lord,
[13:53] to have breath in our body and the
[13:58] ability to look into your eternal word
[14:01] and read it and see you in the verses
[14:06] and lines in which we've read. And
[14:10] truly, Lord, we're grateful that we have
[14:12] eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart
[14:17] to perceive all that you've given to us
[14:19] in this dark hour. And Lord, we truly
[14:24] want to uh yield to you this evening. Uh
[14:28] I trust Lord myself, my brothers and
[14:31] sisters. Lord, we want that welcoming
[14:35] spirit that your prophet talked about
[14:39] that you would be able to walk each
[14:42] aisle and behind the pull pit and and
[14:45] that you would just have preeminence. We
[14:48] we truly Lord don't want to be seen in
[14:51] ourselves but we just want to be
[14:54] surrendered so that you could help your
[14:56] children tonight. We commit this service
[14:59] into your hands and ask Lord that every
[15:02] word that would be spoken that uh it
[15:06] would be uh well pleasing to you and it
[15:09] would be a help to your children. asking
[15:12] your blessings upon each one, loving you
[15:15] and praising you, asking you forgive us
[15:18] of all our wrongs and sins. And we ask
[15:21] these things to be so in the
[15:24] allsufficient name, the only name, our
[15:27] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[15:31] bless you. You can be seated if you
[15:34] like.
[15:35] And um
[15:37] I I'd like to speak to you this evening
[15:40] uh uh on touched
[15:43] uh a third part and um but all three of
[15:47] them is we don't need to do any type of
[15:50] uh u rehearsing because it's just a
[15:53] simple little thought but just some
[15:55] things on my heart I want to uh share
[15:57] with you and I trust that it'll be a
[15:59] help to you. Um you know um brother
[16:03] Brandham tells us uh that um then see
[16:07] God came down the character of God was
[16:10] Christ. He was the reflection. He was
[16:14] God made visible. Notice God made
[16:17] visible. In the beginning was God. He
[16:20] wasn't even God. No God is an object of
[16:23] worship. Only thing he was was that
[16:26] eternal. And in him was attributes. And
[16:29] let let me stop here. We all know these
[16:32] things, right? But but you think about
[16:35] you realize how many billions of people
[16:38] don't know what you know tonight.
[16:40] So So it ought to it ought not to be
[16:42] common to us or or we've heard that last
[16:46] Sunday or we heard that Wednesday or
[16:48] right and and you know what that's not
[16:51] an easy thing to do. But but we ought to
[16:54] be mindful of how blessed we truly are
[16:57] to be believers of what we actually
[16:59] believe tonight.
[17:01] And and so let's let's let's look at it
[17:03] like we never looked at it before,
[17:06] right? He says in him was attributes and
[17:09] those attributes were thoughts and those
[17:12] thoughts was expressed to words and word
[17:14] was made manifest. What is it? It's all
[17:18] God becoming tangible
[17:21] and you are part of God. So God is not
[17:24] complete until you're fully expressed,
[17:27] right? In all your frailty,
[17:30] in all your shortcomings, in all your
[17:33] mistakes,
[17:35] but but think of it and and and so many
[17:38] times we miss it. If if you wasn't
[17:41] needing a savior, there would be no need
[17:44] of him tonight.
[17:46] Right? We How many we as we as human
[17:49] beings sometimes we we get tired of of
[17:53] always having to be the savior of the
[17:55] situation?
[17:58] Anybody? Yes, sir. Right. But God don't
[18:01] get tired.
[18:03] That's just what he is. He's a savior
[18:09] and he needs to be wanted.
[18:14] And just like I said, we've heard these
[18:16] quotes over and over again. The same
[18:19] thing holds true. Many times, we become
[18:22] so revelated,
[18:24] we want to save ourselves.
[18:32] But really in essence, we just need to
[18:35] be
[18:37] frail,
[18:38] feeble human beings in which we truly
[18:40] are and realize we need a savior this
[18:44] evening. God saved me uh 2001, the
[18:48] spring of 2001, but I need him today
[18:52] just as much now as I needed him back
[18:56] then. Amen. And I believe we should
[18:58] never lose the sight of that savior.
[19:03] Right. Now watch what he says. He says
[19:06] it was all God becoming tangible
[19:10] and you are part of God and Jesus come
[19:13] to redeem those that put on put on the
[19:16] lamb's book of life before the
[19:18] foundation of the world. It was God's
[19:21] thoughts and that's what he had come to
[19:23] redeem. And then as soon
[19:28] as it strikes them, they see it because
[19:31] the life is in there. But if the life
[19:34] isn't there, then what can they do? See,
[19:38] they don't see it, they'll never see it.
[19:42] But the beautiful thing is you can unsee
[19:46] it. Amen. That's right.
[19:51] Because you are part of God.
[19:53] you I I was talking about back uh the
[19:56] back brother Chad uh today this week I
[20:01] listened to um I was listening to uh uh
[20:03] uh uh three kinds of believers and uh
[20:07] I'm going to be all over the place
[20:09] tonight. Is that okay? And uh and so uh
[20:14] as I was listening to that, Brother
[20:16] Brandham says, man, if you haven't
[20:18] listened to it, it is so beautiful, so
[20:20] profound. He says some things in there,
[20:22] but but one thing he says at the end of
[20:25] that when he talks about the genuine
[20:27] believer, you you know you know when he
[20:30] pulls out the scripture for a genuine
[20:32] believer, he pulls out when Peter when
[20:35] Jesus asked Peter, who do you say who do
[20:38] men say that I am? And and we all know
[20:42] uh Peter says, "Thou art the Christ, the
[20:45] son of the living God." Brother Brandham
[20:48] takes that verse and he says, "See, a
[20:52] believer is known of of God by spiritual
[20:55] revelation."
[20:56] [Music]
[20:58] But but what is so amazing to me is
[21:00] brother Brandon would take that and it
[21:03] wasn't but a few verses later that that
[21:06] same God would call s call Peter and
[21:09] said, "Satan, get thee behind me." Yeah,
[21:12] that's right. Amen. That's right. and
[21:15] and and but that never shook the prophet
[21:17] to use that scripture to identify a true
[21:20] believer.
[21:22] And so to me, it just it just rung in my
[21:25] soul because so many times we we we get
[21:29] the revelation and then we fall.
[21:36] But we need to be reminded that that
[21:38] doesn't keep us from being a believer.
[21:42] Praise God. See, and and and
[21:46] another thing that brother Brennham says
[21:48] I thought was so profound
[21:50] uh at the end of of three kinds
[21:52] believers, if you if you ain't listen to
[21:55] it while Oh my, you need to listen to
[21:58] it. It is just it's so beautiful. Watch
[22:00] what Brother Brandham says. This is this
[22:03] is just amazing. At the end of it, he
[22:06] says, "Look,
[22:09] you're in one of these classes."
[22:12] Now, pay attention. And I wish I if I
[22:15] should have put it in a slide just so
[22:16] you can see it. In your present state
[22:19] right now, the present state of mind,
[22:22] you are in this visible audience. And
[22:25] you that will be invisible audience on
[22:28] this tape. Your present state of mind
[22:32] after listening to this tape proves to
[22:35] you what class you're in. Praise.
[22:43] So listen, remember brother brother Gabe
[22:47] seventh seal and the horizontal rainbow
[22:49] and Daniel 70 weeks and the seven vows
[22:53] and
[22:56] no
[22:58] thing from Genesis to Revelation
[23:01] God wanted to touch.
[23:04] He wanted to feel. Amen. So don't make
[23:09] it complex.
[23:11] And we look at our mistakes, but the
[23:14] prophet makes it so simple. You want to
[23:16] know if you're a belie. How many wants
[23:17] to know? Brother Gabe, I need to know.
[23:22] Okay. Listen to three kinds of
[23:23] believers.
[23:25] And when you're listening to it, know
[23:27] that at the end there's going to be a
[23:28] pop quiz.
[23:32] Remember this is Dr. Brandon,
[23:37] right? That's right. I I can show you
[23:39] the quote. I love Dr. Brandom cuz cuz it
[23:42] ain't a PhDL like men give, but he got
[23:46] it on the back side of the desert.
[23:49] And he tells us he says he says uh uh
[23:53] you would in this invisible audience on
[23:56] this tape, your present state of mind as
[23:59] to listening to this tape proves to you
[24:02] what class you're in. It tells you
[24:05] exactly where you are,
[24:08] whether you are a believer in the word
[24:11] and will stay with it, whether you'd
[24:14] walk out and shut the tape off.
[24:19] You say, "Brother Gabe, that's too
[24:22] easy." Praise God. Yes. Thank you.
[24:26] That's right. Because you are the one I
[24:29] am the one that's complicating things.
[24:32] Right.
[24:34] How many's ever listened to Three Kinds
[24:36] of believers? Amen. Did you shut the
[24:38] tape off at the end?
[24:40] No.
[24:42] No.
[24:44] So, what does that prove to you?
[24:47] Well, brother No. No. No. No. Stop.
[24:51] Stop.
[24:53] What does that pro? Yeah, but Brother
[24:54] Gabe, I have so many mistakes. Okay,
[24:57] Sister Bruce. Okay.
[25:00] Okay. Okay, Sister Bruce. Okay, I I get
[25:04] it. I get it. But but the thing of it is
[25:08] he's the high priest of your confession.
[25:12] And you have to remember confession, you
[25:16] have to say the same thing as the
[25:18] scriptures. And you're never going to
[25:20] live any higher than your confession.
[25:24] And too many times we look in the mirror
[25:27] instead of looking in the mirror of
[25:29] God's word. And this may look it may
[25:33] seem elementary here in the sanctuary
[25:35] and we got all kinds of people. We sung
[25:37] the songs of Zion, got the preaching,
[25:39] everything feels good, right? But it's
[25:41] when you're out there.
[25:45] It's when you're out there that it
[25:46] becomes complicated
[25:48] and you see your frailty and you see
[25:50] your mistakes. But that's why we have a
[25:53] message
[25:55] for us to go back to and we have to
[25:57] anchor our soul into that. That's right.
[26:00] No matter what we It remember cuz when
[26:03] I'm talk when I'm when we're preaching
[26:04] about about touch and feel, it's not
[26:07] about how we feel.
[26:10] Amen. That's right. Yes, sir. Your
[26:12] feelings will beat you to pieces.
[26:15] If if if we are if we are are are
[26:18] dependent upon what we feel, we're going
[26:20] to have highs and lows and ins and outs
[26:22] and ups and downs and those are many and
[26:25] and and and those are so complex many
[26:28] times. But remember, God sees the end.
[26:31] Amen. Amen.
[26:34] And we have to look to the end.
[26:38] We we have to have those that endure to
[26:41] the end, the same shall be saved. And
[26:45] there has to be an endurance for this
[26:47] bride of Jesus Christ. And there's,
[26:50] listen, there's no way for us to fake
[26:52] it. That's right.
[26:55] So, so when you take that pop quiz, be
[26:59] honest enough with yourself
[27:02] cuz why why try to fool yourself?
[27:05] You know, the there's too many unfailing
[27:08] realities of a living God for us to go
[27:10] trying around bluffing. The the the
[27:12] brother Bram said, "The Pentecostal
[27:14] skies are full of God's blessings. All
[27:16] we got to do is be honest enough to tap
[27:18] into them and pull them down to us."
[27:20] Right? Amen. Now, watch this.
[27:24] You know, you know the the problem of it
[27:27] is brother Benham tells us when he's
[27:29] when he was in Durban, South Africa, he
[27:31] says, "Now notice there's where the
[27:33] troubled of it is. There's why we can't
[27:35] have spontaneous healing. Why I I stood
[27:38] at Durban, South Africa, and saw
[27:40] something happen here on the platform.
[27:42] 25,000 people got healed at one time.
[27:45] They took seven car loads, truckloads,
[27:48] cattle trucks with crutches,
[27:49] wheelchairs, and everything off the
[27:51] ground. and 30,000 raw heated come to
[27:54] Christ at one altar call. Right? Then
[27:56] they wasn't indoctated.
[28:02] Well, they didn't go there and say,
[28:04] "Well, now Dr. Jones said that that was
[28:06] mental telepathy." Well, Dr. Henry said
[28:08] that that was fortunetelling. They had
[28:10] no Dr. Henry's and no Dr. Joneses. They
[28:13] just see, all we need is Dr. Brandom,
[28:16] right? He says, "They just come with a
[28:19] simple childlike faith and believed it."
[28:23] That's right. Oh, but all we Americans,
[28:29] you know, we're so scholarly and so
[28:33] untouchable.
[28:38] You know, we know all about it. That's
[28:42] right. And in this message, we've had it
[28:45] so much and so plentiful. But but what
[28:49] if what if we was in another country and
[28:51] we had five books.
[28:58] Right. Yeah, but but we live in a
[29:00] country where there's it's so plenty
[29:03] that that we may have the table on the
[29:06] front of the the very first page, but
[29:09] how many times do we scroll past it to
[29:12] get to just in case a believer checks
[29:14] our phone? We
[29:19] super believer.
[29:26] But how many times do you scroll past
[29:28] that table to get to what you really
[29:31] want to get to?
[29:38] See,
[29:40] and and by becoming so, you know, I I
[29:45] think we live in a time where where
[29:47] where it there's so much knowledge and
[29:49] so much information and there's they
[29:52] ain't we live in an hour where nobody's
[29:54] even trying to hide anything, right?
[29:56] Even even the conspiracy there no more
[29:58] conspiracy theories. They just come out
[30:00] and tell you, right? And and because we
[30:03] live in this age of of so much
[30:06] information, we become spiritually numb
[30:09] to everything
[30:11] because it's so plentiful. And and and
[30:14] if we ain't careful, we can become
[30:17] untouchable,
[30:20] right?
[30:21] Well, the gospel don't move us unless we
[30:25] see a quote that we've never seen
[30:27] before.
[30:33] or we or we hear a message in a way that
[30:36] we've never
[30:38] like like if is is is that all that
[30:41] we're striving for?
[30:44] I is is the is to find the next big
[30:47] preacher that preaches it to us in a way
[30:49] that wows us.
[30:52] But if but if that's it, is that the
[30:55] essence of eternal life?
[30:58] No,
[31:01] all that is doing is tickling
[31:05] our ears.
[31:07] And the gospel is, remember, the gospel
[31:10] doesn't shine.
[31:12] The gospel glows.
[31:14] The gospel glows in humility,
[31:18] in sincerity.
[31:21] And if we want to I I don't know about
[31:22] you, but I want to be able to touch the
[31:24] heart of God. And I want the heart of
[31:27] God to touch me. And in order for us to
[31:30] do that, we have to be able to to
[31:32] surrender ourselves in a such way that
[31:35] we have to
[31:38] we actually have to be
[31:41] soft.
[31:45] But you know, us brothers,
[31:48] we're not built that way.
[31:52] We live in a world of grinding.
[31:56] We live in a world of pushing through.
[32:00] We live in a world of responsibility
[32:03] where I don't have time because I've got
[32:06] too many responsibilities.
[32:10] And because of we have that we have that
[32:13] structure in life, it becomes so complex
[32:16] that it begins to numb us
[32:22] cuz all we have is the ability to slice
[32:26] out a little bit of time on Wednesday.
[32:31] And Lord forbid, Brother Chad has too
[32:34] many Saturday, Sunday services.
[32:41] Do I got to find somebody another
[32:43] brother to squeeze?
[32:48] Come on, friends. You know what I'm
[32:50] talking about.
[32:52] And and and and the thing of it is is,
[32:54] you know, men are built to suffer in
[32:57] silence.
[33:00] That's how we're built.
[33:02] Men will suffer in silence.
[33:08] Because because because because
[33:11] of the world that we live in and all of
[33:13] the influences that we have, we're
[33:15] supposed to be able to carry the load.
[33:19] And because we carry the load so much,
[33:22] we end up we end up just hardening
[33:24] ourselves and we become untouchable
[33:29] because we we we don't want to become
[33:33] vulnerable. I I I tell you, I I I say
[33:36] this. I I hope I hope I hope uh
[33:42] um
[33:48] uh
[33:50] Alex, I had to say sad.
[33:54] Say D. you you know you know recently
[33:58] you know they had that they had that
[33:59] wedding and uh my my girls my girls they
[34:04] love the weddings right and so they was
[34:07] ooing and gooing and goggling after the
[34:09] weddings right so so I I I
[34:14] wanted to watch it
[34:16] and you know brother Chad said sister
[34:19] Amy was a glow
[34:21] but you know when I when I watched that
[34:24] that you You know who my eyes was on?
[34:28] My eyes was on that man back there.
[34:33] Because if if you look I I I I told I
[34:36] told I told you daddy this. I said I
[34:39] said listen when I saw brother Alex look
[34:43] at his other half.
[34:46] you know, there could there there really
[34:49] was only one person in the room.
[34:53] And the the way that he looked at her,
[34:57] when I saw his eyes and I saw his heart,
[35:00] I said I I told my girls, I said, "I can
[35:03] only hope
[35:05] that that my my son-in-laws
[35:08] look at my daughters like he looked at
[35:11] her."
[35:14] cuz when I saw him looking, you know,
[35:17] you know, he didn't have to say nothing,
[35:20] but it's just you you can see the heart
[35:22] and and you know, sometime sometime
[35:26] I've seen some wedding pictures and it's
[35:28] like the man didn't want to be there.
[35:29] You know,
[35:34] I hope this is all right, brother. I'm
[35:36] just bragging on you, brother. Cuz I
[35:38] said, cuz listen, I'm telling you, look,
[35:40] you young brothers, listen. You may say,
[35:42] "Brother Gab, I ain't watching no
[35:43] wedding." You need to.
[35:46] I'm telling you, you need to. You need
[35:48] to because listen, if you can't look at
[35:51] your bride like that man looked at her,
[35:52] you you are not worthy of her and you
[35:54] need to keep on growing.
[35:57] I'm I'm I'm telling you because the
[35:59] thing of it is there has to be more than
[36:02] just a show. There has to be more than
[36:05] just artificial put on. That man wasn't
[36:07] worried about the building. He wasn't
[36:09] worried about pastor. He was only
[36:12] concerned with one.
[36:16] And when I saw his eyes, I saw his
[36:18] heart. And I realized that man will die
[36:22] for her.
[36:24] That man will work 16 hours a day, go on
[36:29] four hours of sleep, and get up the next
[36:31] morning and go again.
[36:34] And and to me that's the type of touch
[36:39] we have to have for this gospel.
[36:44] Like like the problem of it is is we
[36:46] become comfortable. Look, we get cleaned
[36:49] up and right God delivers us from from
[36:52] from the the world and the things
[36:55] thereof. But if we ain't careful, we can
[36:58] we can just take all of that stuff and
[37:01] replace it with responsibilities
[37:04] and jobs and careers and
[37:08] hello somebody. And and instead of
[37:10] gambling uh in the pool hall, you're
[37:13] gambling on Wall Street.
[37:19] And it's all about
[37:22] the do reay me.
[37:26] and we lose sight of the realities of
[37:28] God and we don't have time to enter into
[37:33] the sufferings of one another because if
[37:36] look the th this world is hard and and
[37:40] there is no tenderness. There is no
[37:43] touch. There is no sitting across the
[37:45] table and actually having quality time
[37:48] one with the other. but instead it's
[37:52] it's competition and and there's no
[37:54] fellowship. It's it's who can wow who
[37:57] with the with the next quote.
[38:00] And to me it's like no, I I don't want
[38:04] to wow you with the next quote.
[38:08] When I hear that prophet, he don't wow
[38:10] me with his quotes. He wows me with his
[38:13] heart.
[38:17] You you see what I'm saying? And and if
[38:19] and if and if we don't have that type of
[38:21] love, if we don't have that type of
[38:24] feeling, if we don't have that type of
[38:26] touch, what do we really have?
[38:32] Like I don't I don't want to be just a
[38:34] cleaned up better than a Baptist.
[38:40] Right. I I I I want to have the
[38:44] unfailing realities of a living God.
[38:48] Amen. That that whenever people come in
[38:51] contact with me, they see that there's
[38:53] something different
[38:56] like like we don't want to just go
[38:58] through the motions, right?
[39:01] Remember remember brother Brandham talks
[39:03] about he talks about brother Paul Rder.
[39:05] He said him and brother Paul Ra brother
[39:07] Paul Raider at one time he he he got in
[39:10] an argument with his wife and they had
[39:11] this little custom that every time they
[39:13] would they would they would he would
[39:15] leave the house he'd turn back and he
[39:17] would kiss her and then he'd turn back
[39:18] and wave and she'd wave and brother he
[39:21] said he said I I'm going right back to
[39:23] make it right. But but at but after him
[39:25] and Paul had had Paul and his wife had
[39:28] had that little falling out.
[39:34] Now I know that don't happen in y'all's
[39:36] home. Right there. Right.
[39:39] But but after they had had that falling
[39:42] out and he turned around and he he he he
[39:44] did you know he waved but there wasn't a
[39:48] feeling in it.
[39:50] And brother Barham says right right up
[39:52] the street he went and he jerked open
[39:54] the door and she was standing behind the
[39:56] door weeping and he just grabbed her in
[39:58] his arms and kissed her. Went right back
[40:01] out the gate, turned around and said
[40:02] goodbye. And she said goodbye.
[40:08] And he said he and he said, "You might
[40:10] ask me what was the difference. She
[40:13] waved goodbye the first time. She waved
[40:15] goodbye the second time. But the second
[40:18] time had a feeling in it.
[40:22] And that's what made the difference. And
[40:25] brother, what we need today is not a put
[40:28] on love. We need a love that's got a
[40:31] feeling in it that the world will know
[40:33] that we love the Lord Jesus.
[40:37] It has Look, we can't just go through
[40:40] the motions,
[40:43] but there has to be something from the
[40:45] heart. And you say, "I'm not built that
[40:48] way, brother Gabe."
[40:51] Well, unbuild yourself
[40:53] and build yourself according to the
[40:55] stature of Jesus Christ.
[40:59] Look, I know it's not easy,
[41:02] but we have to tear down our imagery of
[41:04] what a man is.
[41:06] These young brothers need to see the
[41:09] correct imagery of what a young what a
[41:11] real man is.
[41:13] They have to be able to see that dad.
[41:16] They got to be able to see dad cry.
[41:26] You know, some of my fondest memories in
[41:28] my life is my dad being affectionate to
[41:32] me.
[41:34] When I go back memory lane, it's not the
[41:36] GI Joes he bought me. It's not the
[41:39] bicycle that he got me, but my fondest
[41:42] memories is he and I, him putting me to
[41:46] sleep and laying back to back because
[41:49] that was our thing.
[41:53] My fondest memories is is me as a little
[41:55] boy and he giving me a kiss.
[42:04] Because as young people, they need
[42:08] children need
[42:10] that kind of affection.
[42:13] If if they don't get it from you, who
[42:16] will they get it from? Cuz they're going
[42:18] to get it from somebody.
[42:21] And if we don't I'm saying we You
[42:23] understand what I'm saying? Parent.
[42:27] I'm not talking about no weird stuff
[42:29] now. You understand what I'm saying? But
[42:31] but you know what? But the here's the
[42:33] thing. because we live at such a a
[42:36] hyperritical and all kind of filth. What
[42:39] that does because that we live in a
[42:40] filthy uh uh age and there's all kind of
[42:44] demonicness and craziness. It what that
[42:47] does it makes the real believers pull
[42:49] back and be and we can become isolated
[42:52] and afraid to God bless you.
[42:55] Right? Right? And because of that, then
[42:58] then then our children don't know what
[43:00] it's like to feel that love.
[43:05] But listen, you let me I'll say it like
[43:08] this. You may have all boys, but what if
[43:10] your boys have all girls?
[43:17] Because if if you got all boys and you
[43:19] raised them to be a man,
[43:22] but what if what if they grow up and
[43:24] they have all girls?
[43:27] How are they going to be able you you
[43:31] know because of what my dad done to me
[43:32] as a little boy back to back and giving
[43:36] me a kiss and that I knew I knew that we
[43:40] and it didn't matter. I'm telling you my
[43:43] dad was born in 1948 and I don't care
[43:46] who your dad is. My dad can beat up your
[43:49] dad
[43:52] without a shadow of a doubt.
[43:55] I don't Well, brother Chad's there. I
[43:58] put money on it
[44:03] cuz it's not gambling cuz he's going to
[44:05] win.
[44:14] But because my dad did that to me
[44:17] when I had my children,
[44:20] I spent time.
[44:23] I I made sure that there was little
[44:25] things that was just me and them
[44:31] because I knew how special it was for
[44:33] me. And because I knew how special it it
[44:36] made me feel, I wanted those three
[44:39] little girls to feel the same love that
[44:41] I felt as a little boy.
[44:44] Do you understand what I'm saying? And
[44:46] we look, I'm I'm preaching to you. Yes.
[44:49] And I'm preaching to you. Yes. And I'm
[44:52] preaching to you young brothers. It's
[44:54] You understand? You listen. You You You
[44:56] got to write notes. There ought to be
[44:58] see I see some pins moving something
[45:03] because you need this cuz no matter how
[45:07] you know you may have been raised or the
[45:09] problems you had or the complexes what
[45:11] you have to do is you have to be able to
[45:13] set those things aside and say I'm dying
[45:16] out to self
[45:18] because I want my family to have a
[45:20] better way.
[45:22] I can't tell you how many nights I
[45:25] stayed up rubbing a belly
[45:31] and then when I think she was asleep and
[45:32] I'd put my hand down, she would reach up
[45:35] and grape and put that hand back up
[45:40] and I had to rub the belly for another
[45:41] half hour. It's a wonder that little
[45:44] baby skin didn't have calluses on that
[45:46] belly.
[45:50] But but that was her and I's thing.
[45:54] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[45:55] Because when when I'm dead and gone, if
[45:58] God carries, she'll remember that
[46:02] cuz she she had not just the thought,
[46:05] but she felt the love behind it.
[46:10] See, one one thing that that that if you
[46:12] if you you young brothers and getting
[46:14] ready to have children, remember this.
[46:16] you, especially you brothers, you think,
[46:18] well, when they get older, I'm going to
[46:19] No, no, no, no, no. Everything that you
[46:22] put in that child from 0 to 7 years old
[46:24] stays in their subconscious.
[46:30] So, you have to be mindful that it's not
[46:33] whenever they can walk. No, no. When
[46:35] that listen, when my children was
[46:37] babies, I was pouring into them. And you
[46:40] know, look, you say you look, you want
[46:42] rug rats, call them that.
[46:45] You want a rug rat, call him that.
[46:48] But but but if you want a child of God,
[46:50] call him the elect of God.
[46:53] That's exactly right. And and and and
[46:56] what I would do, listen, I lay him down
[46:58] with me, right? Uh uh uh Mina, Naomi was
[47:02] disarmed and Anna was disarmed and
[47:04] Rachel came along. She was on my chest
[47:06] and uh we'd lay on the floor at night
[47:09] and uh I'd ask some questions. Is this
[47:12] okay? Amen. I ask them questions. I say,
[47:15] "What's your favorite color?"
[47:18] They tell me the favorite color. And
[47:20] then I say, "Do you know that you're the
[47:22] elect of God?" And they say, "Yes,
[47:25] Daddy."
[47:26] And I say, "What's your favorite food?"
[47:29] "Pizza.
[47:33] Do you know that your name was put on
[47:35] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[47:37] foundation of the world?" And they would
[47:40] say, "Yes, Daddy.
[47:46] See? And then I'd get quiet and they
[47:48] say, "Daddy, ask us questions."
[47:58] But see, brother, look, if you're
[48:00] worried about that paycheck,
[48:02] those are the moments you'll miss.
[48:05] That's right.
[48:09] And and and I hope I'm I'm not trying to
[48:11] stand up here as super dad because I
[48:13] have made so many mistakes and failures
[48:17] and it's the grace of God that my
[48:19] children are loving God and serving God
[48:21] right now. So I am not this ain't no
[48:24] soap box by any stretch of the
[48:27] imagination. But my point is is you you
[48:31] young brothers and you young sisters
[48:32] have to be mindful of those little
[48:34] moments in life because those are the
[48:37] times that you can really reach out and
[48:39] touch someone.
[48:42] But the same goes for our old our elder
[48:46] ones
[48:52] because there's moments that we can miss
[48:56] because we're so busy.
[49:01] And if we we can get caught up in this
[49:04] rat race of life and we miss all the
[49:07] opportunities
[49:09] to be able to touch someone. And it may
[49:12] not be a physical but just a word that
[49:15] you say,
[49:17] a text that you send,
[49:21] stopping by and just saying hello.
[49:25] It's being mindful and and and when you
[49:27] hear that their birthday is such and
[49:29] such a time that you put it on your
[49:31] calendar and you put it in your
[49:32] reminders that every year it pops up so
[49:35] that you'll be able to be the one to go,
[49:37] "Hey,
[49:38] happy birthday, sister."
[49:42] When everybody else forgets, you was the
[49:45] one that touched them that day.
[49:49] See, and and and and is it is it some
[49:52] Listen, that is the seventh seal on
[49:55] display.
[50:04] Cuz whose hands
[50:07] is he going to use?
[50:11] Whose mouth
[50:13] is he going to use? Whose feet is he
[50:17] going to walk in?
[50:19] Because Christ wants to come in every
[50:21] one of us and make himself known to
[50:24] everyone that we come in contact with
[50:26] every day of our life.
[50:31] I if if we ain't careful, we'll we'll
[50:34] get calloused by this thing called life.
[50:37] And and and if you know when we talk
[50:40] about sin so many times you know you
[50:42] know when we talk about sin
[50:45] sin is unbelief.
[50:48] So a lot of times when we say sin we
[50:50] think alcohol drugs you know some kind
[50:52] of filth on the internet or whatever.
[50:55] But it it sin is just unbelieving God's
[50:58] word.
[51:00] Right. So so so you can say yeah it's
[51:03] right. for me
[51:10] and and brother Brennham types uh uh sin
[51:13] is leprosy. Leprosy in the Bible, right?
[51:17] So So if you look at leprosy in the
[51:19] Bible,
[51:21] leprosy is something that happens
[51:23] gradually.
[51:26] It can take anywhere from six months to
[51:28] 20 years. And what it is is it numbs you
[51:33] and it's a thickening and a distortion
[51:35] of your flesh
[51:38] so that you can't touch.
[51:42] And so when we talk about sin, the
[51:45] moment we disbelieve God's word, any of
[51:48] God's word,
[51:52] that is leprosy.
[51:54] We are called to be believers
[51:58] and believers believe despite of the
[52:01] symptoms,
[52:02] right? I if if if we ain't brother says
[52:06] he says only God can cure leprosy, they
[52:09] don't they ain't found nothing for it to
[52:11] help it. But it's a type of sin. It sets
[52:14] in so gradual it's painless.
[52:20] And so if sin comes into our life, we
[52:23] can become numbed.
[52:28] So numb that the services don't move us
[52:32] like they used to.
[52:36] I've heard that before. I know where
[52:39] he's going.
[52:41] I've seen that.
[52:44] And the moment we do that, it begins to
[52:47] numb us.
[52:56] You know,
[53:00] I was I was talking to uh Sister Karen
[53:03] Sanders a couple weeks ago
[53:06] and uh she said something so profound to
[53:09] me. She she was sharing a testimony and
[53:13] uh uh was at the house and uh at her
[53:17] house and she Susan and I and she said
[53:20] uh she was talking about her testimony
[53:22] and she said she said she said I know
[53:26] what's in my alabaster box.
[53:34] And when she said that, it was like a
[53:35] thunderbolt in my soul.
[53:38] And I when I left when I left the house,
[53:41] it just it just kept ringing in my
[53:43] heart. I know what's in my alabaster
[53:47] box.
[53:49] And and if you know the story of when
[53:52] Jesus was s sitting in Simon's house and
[53:56] the unwelcome Christ sitting in there
[53:58] with dirty feet and even the footwash
[54:00] flunky had missed him. And can you
[54:02] imagine that? Everybody smelling the
[54:05] freshness. Your you ever notice, just a
[54:08] little side note, you ever notice how
[54:09] feel how good you feel after foot
[54:11] washing? You ever notice that? Just feel
[54:14] so fresh and just ah, right? You know,
[54:18] and think about that's how it was back
[54:19] in the day when you you had the dust and
[54:22] the dirt and they would wash your feet
[54:24] and they' anoint you just ah, right? And
[54:28] Jesus is the only one
[54:31] that's sitting there with dirty feet.
[54:34] And there's a woman with ill fame
[54:38] that sees that. And she's so she she had
[54:40] she had live ill fame life. And we all
[54:43] know the story. Brother Brandon
[54:44] dramatizes it so beautifully. and and
[54:47] but but brother Brandham when he when he
[54:48] tells that story, brother Brandham said
[54:50] that that when she when she went and
[54:52] bought that alabaster box and came in
[54:54] and wondered and what she should do and
[54:56] when she lays at his feet and brother
[54:59] Bram said she sn said she snapped off
[55:01] the top of it, she broke the seal.
[55:08] When she broke that seal of that
[55:10] alabaster box, how did she get that?
[55:15] What money did she use?
[55:20] Right. All of her livelihood. Brother
[55:22] Bram said she spent put all all that she
[55:25] had in that box. But when she broke
[55:27] that, she knew what was in that
[55:30] alabaster box. She knew the wrongs and
[55:34] the things that had been done in order
[55:36] for her to have that money. But she see
[55:42] but I but I ask you
[55:44] do you know what's in your alabaster
[55:46] box?
[55:52] Do we do we know
[55:55] what are we putting on defeat of Jesus?
[56:01] Do we know where we've been? The wrongs
[56:05] that we have done. with brother Gab.
[56:10] Stop.
[56:13] All of our righteousness
[56:15] is as filthy rags.
[56:18] And and you may have lived just clean
[56:20] and pure as a lily and that's good. But
[56:24] you what you know what's in your
[56:26] alabaster box? I tell you what you need
[56:29] to what you struggle with if you if you
[56:31] haven't already, you will. Is
[56:33] self-righteousness.
[56:39] Amen. Because you know, you know, one
[56:43] thing that just burns my heart is when
[56:45] somebody when you see somebody talking
[56:47] about somebody all tatted up in them
[56:50] drugs and they want to s with all this
[56:52] condemnation. Nine times out of 10 if
[56:55] somebody's filing somebody like that,
[56:57] they ain't ever been there. They ain't
[57:00] ever been there. They don't know what
[57:01] it's about. And because they look and if
[57:05] you look back they like they probably
[57:06] had a mom and daddy love God, serve God.
[57:11] But see if if you take a minute to
[57:13] really look at what's in your alabaster
[57:15] box, then you would take a minute and
[57:17] you'd realize what's in their alabaster
[57:19] box. And you may realize that that
[57:22] person that's all tatted out and and
[57:24] maybe all strung out, that's the only
[57:27] thing that they have.
[57:33] The only joy that they have is that
[57:35] little bit of alcohol or drug or
[57:38] whatever it may be. You've never been
[57:41] there, so you don't know what it's
[57:43] about. You don't know the sorrow that
[57:46] they're trying to drown out. You don't
[57:49] know the pain.
[57:52] See what is, brother Brandon says. What
[57:54] is brother Connis? to walk a mile in
[57:56] another man's shoes is to is to enter
[57:59] into the sufferings of somebody else.
[58:02] And if we want to come to that capstone,
[58:04] we first got to go to brotherly
[58:05] kindness. And that means we got to be
[58:07] able to enter in to the sufferings of
[58:10] one another and realize that that
[58:13] person, they may be bad, they may have
[58:15] done wrong, they may be wrong as the day
[58:18] is longed.
[58:20] But if you would run back that life,
[58:23] you may look at things a little bit
[58:24] differently.
[58:26] See, we can be so quick. And when we're
[58:28] so quick, we become untouchable.
[58:33] But when we step back for a moment and
[58:35] go, "Wait a minute."
[58:42] and we sit across the table of that
[58:44] person
[58:46] and you have a heart of compassion, that
[58:49] person starts opening up and then you
[58:52] realize, oh,
[58:55] oh man.
[59:07] See, if we ain't careful, we can have
[59:11] all this indocamation that we become
[59:14] untouchable.
[59:17] But really, in order to enter into one
[59:19] another's sufferings, we got to be able
[59:21] to put our feet against their feet and
[59:25] realize, "Oh man, my shoes won't fit
[59:28] them." And then we got to put our
[59:30] shoulders against their shoulders.
[59:33] See, brother Brandham, Brother Brandham,
[59:36] look, when brother Brandham, he he he
[59:38] did he he never had to worry about
[59:40] drugs. He wasn't strung out, but he
[59:42] never had that approach.
[59:45] He was always able to enter into the
[59:47] sufferings of that person.
[59:50] He had the ability to tap into that. And
[59:53] we live in a world that if we ain't
[59:54] careful, we can miss it.
[59:57] I I I I want to have that same type of
[1:00:00] life that that prophet of God had that
[1:00:03] I'll be able to tap in and and I'm
[1:00:05] talking about you think about brother
[1:00:06] Brandham listen
[1:00:09] and and and I touched on this but I want
[1:00:11] to touch on it again. Remember when
[1:00:13] brother Brandham said the house was all
[1:00:14] in chaos? I I want you to know I want
[1:00:16] you to see this this in Lime Ohio.
[1:00:21] I thought that was pretty good.
[1:00:24] And I want you to see this. When when
[1:00:27] when brother Brandham had been praying
[1:00:29] all day, discernments,
[1:00:32] remember that remember well Jesus had a
[1:00:34] discernment and it's troubled at his
[1:00:35] head for many days. One of the prophets
[1:00:37] in the scripture something remember
[1:00:38] brother Brandon had discernment after
[1:00:39] discernment after discernment, right?
[1:00:42] Think about we we have no idea how
[1:00:44] exhausted that man was. But I want you
[1:00:48] brothers to think of the last 16 18 hour
[1:00:51] day you had and you wor you only got
[1:00:54] four hours sleep you had to get up and
[1:00:55] do it all again and how tired you was.
[1:00:58] Maybe we have an idea of how he how he
[1:01:00] felt right. Brother Bam says I love this
[1:01:04] and I want you to I want you to see it.
[1:01:05] He says now I'm tired
[1:01:10] me I'm going to bed. You deal with the
[1:01:12] children.
[1:01:18] No,
[1:01:19] he said, "Now I'm tired, but I'm going
[1:01:22] to deal this now. Heavenly Father, in my
[1:01:25] heart, you help me to be what you would
[1:01:28] have me to be in on this scene." So, I
[1:01:31] slip over. I got the apron on. I put it
[1:01:34] around me. I begin. Now, I want you to I
[1:01:36] want you to understand. I want you to
[1:01:37] think about this. Did Brother Brandham
[1:01:40] need to put on the apron?
[1:01:44] So why did he do it?
[1:01:47] Cuz he was entering into her her
[1:01:49] sufferings.
[1:01:53] He was entering into her world. And so
[1:01:56] he puts on the apron.
[1:01:59] He says slipped over. He said, "Put my
[1:02:01] arm around." I began to help her. I
[1:02:03] said, "Honey, you know what? I saw the
[1:02:05] prettiest dress the other day. I just
[1:02:07] once wanted to get it for you. It was
[1:02:09] this certain city there close and we'll
[1:02:11] go get it." And all the time I'm praying
[1:02:13] in my heart, heavenly father, quieten
[1:02:15] this little dear woman. I put my hand on
[1:02:17] her.
[1:02:22] He didn't he didn't rebuke her in Jesus
[1:02:23] name.
[1:02:28] Hey brothers, I'll tell you I say this
[1:02:30] brothers, do you all know how to cut
[1:02:32] cast out a devil on your on your wife?
[1:02:35] Anybody? Anybody want to know how? It's
[1:02:38] okay brother. You listen. They're like,
[1:02:42] "Brother Gab, I'm not raising my hand,
[1:02:44] brother."
[1:02:48] Well, now you don't want to be tough.
[1:02:50] Now,
[1:02:55] you know, Brother V said, "How you cast
[1:02:56] out the devil on on your wife?"
[1:02:59] He said, "Buy a box of chocolates, go
[1:03:02] home, tell her you love her."
[1:03:06] That's what he said. He says, "Look,
[1:03:09] hold on. We'll go back to this. Hold on.
[1:03:11] Look. He says, he said, "Remind me a
[1:03:13] message morning." He said, "I try to
[1:03:15] cast out a devil." I said, "Devil, you
[1:03:17] come out of my wife. Devil, you come out
[1:03:19] of my wife. Honey, you're possessed with
[1:03:21] a devil. Come out, devil." I said,
[1:03:23] "That's fine, brother Fandler, but you
[1:03:25] go at it wrong." He said, "Well, how do
[1:03:27] you do it?" I said, "When you go home,
[1:03:30] buy a box of candy, give it to her, come
[1:03:34] at the door, put your arm around her,
[1:03:36] that's the way you cast out a devil.
[1:03:38] Love cast out fear, doesn't it?
[1:03:43] Love.
[1:03:46] See,
[1:03:49] that's to me.
[1:03:52] What's he What's he telling us? It's not
[1:03:55] fast and pray. Fast and pray and I'm
[1:03:57] going to Don't you know I'm going to
[1:03:58] head her down?
[1:04:03] No. No.
[1:04:05] Enter into her sufferings.
[1:04:07] Buy her a box of candy. Put your arm
[1:04:10] around her and tell her you love her.
[1:04:12] Watch what Brother Bram says. He says,
[1:04:16] I said, I put my hand on and knowing not
[1:04:18] knowing what I was doing. I said, yes,
[1:04:20] honey. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh Lord,
[1:04:22] quiet this little woman. I just kept on,
[1:04:24] you know, her not knowing what was I
[1:04:26] doing was projecting, creating a
[1:04:28] different atmosphere, walking in the
[1:04:31] love of God, had a fellowship. And in a
[1:04:33] few moments she got quiet. And then when
[1:04:35] she would got quiet, Sarah, Becky
[1:04:37] divided the play box. Joseph got him
[1:04:38] something to play with. And there was
[1:04:40] peace in the home. What was it
[1:04:42] projecting love? They were mine. My
[1:04:46] children, my wife,
[1:04:49] and I
[1:04:50] was God.
[1:05:00] He was God.
[1:05:04] wore out,
[1:05:06] exhausted.
[1:05:10] But what did he do?
[1:05:14] He died out to himself.
[1:05:22] Because remember, touching our family is
[1:05:25] not just a paycheck.
[1:05:33] It's not having a title deed in the safe
[1:05:35] deposit box.
[1:05:42] It's not having a 2025.
[1:05:45] It's not having six figures or seven
[1:05:47] figures in the bank account.
[1:05:53] Come on, brothers.
[1:05:57] But what is it? It's entering into the
[1:06:00] sufferings of our families.
[1:06:04] It's when our children act up that we we
[1:06:06] we think
[1:06:08] 12 year old thoughts
[1:06:11] instead of 51y old thoughts.
[1:06:15] And in order for a 50year-old man to
[1:06:18] think like a 12y old girl is not an easy
[1:06:21] task.
[1:06:25] Little challenging at times.
[1:06:28] and then flip into a 15y old and a
[1:06:32] 16 year old with license.
[1:06:42] But listen, if God give you those
[1:06:44] children, God equipped you to handle
[1:06:46] those children.
[1:06:51] But in order for you to handle that
[1:06:52] family, I'm learning more and more that
[1:06:56] in order for us to have the right
[1:06:58] relationship with our children and our
[1:07:00] family, we have to have the right
[1:07:02] relationship with our heavenly father.
[1:07:06] And that may seem so elementary and
[1:07:08] yeah, oh yeah, brother. Well, yeah, but
[1:07:10] apply it in your everyday life.
[1:07:13] Apply it when you put in that 16- hour
[1:07:15] day and you're tired and you want to
[1:07:17] just check out
[1:07:19] and go to the barn.
[1:07:24] Man, I ain't get no amens. Can I get
[1:07:26] some estrogen amens at least? I tell you
[1:07:30] what, I'm going to learn how to do a I
[1:07:32] need a I'mma find a amen sign like sign
[1:07:34] language and you sisters can be like
[1:07:40] [Laughter]
[1:07:46] it's the truth anyhow,
[1:07:48] right? I'm not pulling for amens. I'm
[1:07:50] just trying to tell you that listen
[1:07:52] friends, it it is not just me. We all
[1:07:56] play a part in this. And listen, is it
[1:07:59] is is it going to be easy? No. But I I I
[1:08:02] I when I get there, I want the Lord to
[1:08:06] say, "Well done, thou good and faithful
[1:08:08] servant." And in order for us to do
[1:08:11] that, it's not just it's not just on the
[1:08:14] job, but but it's it's to me, Brother
[1:08:17] Bram said, it's not the big things that
[1:08:18] we don't do, it's the little things we
[1:08:20] leave undone.
[1:08:24] And and
[1:08:26] it's when we're tired.
[1:08:29] It's when we're tired can we be God.
[1:08:35] It's when we're wore out and we've had a
[1:08:37] bad day and we've had the greatest day
[1:08:41] ever.
[1:08:42] And when we walk in the door, y'all know
[1:08:45] when you walk in the door, you can tell
[1:08:46] the atmosphere ain't right. And you're
[1:08:48] like, uhoh.
[1:08:51] Should I run? Did they?
[1:08:56] You know, I'm the only one. They like
[1:08:57] four again. I know I'm big, but there's
[1:09:00] four of them.
[1:09:05] Brother Jad got some backup. You know
[1:09:07] what I mean?
[1:09:09] Oh,
[1:09:12] hey, you know, you know, you know your
[1:09:14] family. You could just walk in and it
[1:09:15] just that atmosphere and you're like,
[1:09:17] uhoh.
[1:09:18] You like you hear that you hear that
[1:09:21] horror movie uh music is like,
[1:09:27] oh man, where that come from? Right.
[1:09:30] Y'all
[1:09:31] [Laughter]
[1:09:33] ain't no need to hug brothers Chad.
[1:09:35] Squeeze brother Chad,
[1:09:37] right? But listen, hey, so it's it's
[1:09:40] when it's when we walk into that
[1:09:42] environment
[1:09:43] and we've had a great day,
[1:09:49] but instead of us talking about our
[1:09:51] great day, we start mediating
[1:09:56] and we set our great day aside.
[1:10:04] Or it's when we've had a bad day. Oh
[1:10:07] God, help us. Help us, Lord. Right? To
[1:10:11] me, friends, that's that's what I'm
[1:10:14] looking at my life. I'm saying, God,
[1:10:15] please, please, please help me.
[1:10:19] I want to be a Christian. I want to be a
[1:10:21] real Christian then. I want to be that
[1:10:24] right there all the time,
[1:10:27] right?
[1:10:30] like I if not if not what what to me
[1:10:36] when I when I see when I see this
[1:10:38] message
[1:10:40] um I didn't I didn't hardly get anywhere
[1:10:44] tonight. Um
[1:10:46] uh boy I tell you there's a
[1:10:50] I tell you in in order for this word I
[1:10:53] just got to share this with you. So, so
[1:10:57] this word, this is what I love about
[1:10:59] this message. This message makes it such
[1:11:02] a reality to me. Like
[1:11:06] when when when God makes himself known
[1:11:09] and and you see all the character like
[1:11:11] brother Chad been preaching and and God
[1:11:13] unveils himself as father,
[1:11:16] right? It makes you feel safe and
[1:11:18] secure. Then God unveils himself as
[1:11:21] friend. And right and and and and you
[1:11:24] you all you you you sisters, you young
[1:11:26] brothers, you all know there's there's
[1:11:28] things that you'll tell friend that you
[1:11:31] won't tell father.
[1:11:35] But that's why God covered the whole
[1:11:37] spectrum of husband, father, friend,
[1:11:40] son, brother. Yeah. He He's He's mother
[1:11:43] El cuz he wants us to understand
[1:11:46] everything that we have need of, he's
[1:11:49] our sufficiency. Amen. And and and so so
[1:11:54] when we think about the the the the
[1:11:56] message of the hour and what God has
[1:11:58] done and you know, Brother Bam talked
[1:12:00] about the the the the the first and
[1:12:02] second pool and and and we know the
[1:12:04] vision know it well, right? The first
[1:12:06] pool catching little itty bitty fish,
[1:12:08] second pool a little bit bigger and
[1:12:10] tangled all around him. Third bull is to
[1:12:12] catch the rainbow trout, right? How many
[1:12:15] is the rainbow trout? Right. Well, well,
[1:12:18] think about this. This is and I I want
[1:12:21] you to to think about this real quick.
[1:12:23] And I just I just I I'll try to close
[1:12:25] with this. It's 8:30.
[1:12:27] Brother Brandham, just for a little
[1:12:29] background, this right here, Brother
[1:12:32] Brandham is remember the first the first
[1:12:34] pull was the sign in the hand. He had
[1:12:36] have to he'd have to lay his hand on
[1:12:38] somebody and he'd see the vibrations and
[1:12:40] he and brother this was amazing. Brother
[1:12:42] Baron says sometimes I had to guess at
[1:12:44] it.
[1:12:46] I know it's what he said. It was I know
[1:12:48] that's what I said. I was like, "Wow, I
[1:12:49] didn't realize that." But it's it's
[1:12:50] there. He said, "I guessed." And uh he
[1:12:53] said it wasn't quite perfect. Uh and uh
[1:13:00] let's see. Um
[1:13:06] um
[1:13:10] uh
[1:13:12] well I can show it to you after church.
[1:13:15] Let me time for time sake. I don't want
[1:13:16] to try to find it but it it's in there.
[1:13:18] So he said but but in this right here at
[1:13:21] this transition between the first and
[1:13:23] the second pool brother Brandham has uh
[1:13:26] uh this is going to be the discerning of
[1:13:28] the hearts. And so it's in 1950, brother
[1:13:31] Brandham tells his story and it's a it's
[1:13:34] a sister that comes to him. Now watch
[1:13:36] this. Now remember, brother Bram says,
[1:13:40] "You have to know my ministry and things
[1:13:41] to understand these symbols,
[1:13:44] right?" So, so this is beautiful to me.
[1:13:48] So here's the transition. The prophet is
[1:13:52] transitioning from the first pool to the
[1:13:53] second pool. And there's a sister, a
[1:13:57] woman that stands before him.
[1:14:00] Coincidence?
[1:14:02] Nope.
[1:14:04] Right. So to me, anytime I see Brother
[1:14:08] Brandham, I look at him just like
[1:14:09] Elijah, Elisha, right, with a woman and
[1:14:13] all these, you know, all those are
[1:14:14] symbols and shadows, right? Just like
[1:14:16] Jesus. He's a prophet, right? And so
[1:14:19] here's a woman.
[1:14:21] She's got back trouble, but she also got
[1:14:24] she's also blind in one eye.
[1:14:31] And so she's blind in one eye.
[1:14:35] And brother Brandham, he starts
[1:14:37] discerning. She says, "And there she
[1:14:38] went back again. I seen a young lady
[1:14:41] about 16 years old, and she had just run
[1:14:44] just as hard as she could. And she had a
[1:14:46] blue ribbon tied in the back, double
[1:14:48] plat hanging on the back. And she was on
[1:14:50] a checker dress and she was running real
[1:14:52] fast. And I looked and there was a big
[1:14:54] yellow dog chasing her. I see the young
[1:14:56] lady with a checker dress begin to tell
[1:14:59] what I was seeing. Looked in front of me
[1:15:00] and she she goes up on the porch and I
[1:15:03] seen a lady take her in run and she
[1:15:05] started screaming. She said, "That was
[1:15:08] me when I was going to school." said, "I
[1:15:12] never thought of it before in my life."
[1:15:18] Now, this sister is coming to the
[1:15:20] prophet for healing of the eye and back
[1:15:23] trouble.
[1:15:25] But the angel of the Lord saw something
[1:15:27] deeper
[1:15:32] because remember the word of God is a
[1:15:34] discerner
[1:15:36] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:15:38] heart. That's what that's how powerful
[1:15:40] this message is. Because there's things
[1:15:43] when I see this sister, there was
[1:15:46] problems in her life that she didn't
[1:15:49] know she had
[1:15:51] until she stood before the prophet.
[1:15:54] And the angel of the Lord went way back
[1:15:58] into her life. She was going there for
[1:16:01] something superficial,
[1:16:06] right?
[1:16:09] But God was going deeper.
[1:16:12] And that's like what this message does
[1:16:14] to us. We go thinking that once we stop
[1:16:17] I remember when I thought, man, when I
[1:16:18] stopped drinking and all drugging, all
[1:16:20] boy, I'm going to have it all.
[1:16:22] Nope.
[1:16:25] You just scratching the surface,
[1:16:27] brother.
[1:16:30] Right. And then that word starts coming
[1:16:33] and it starts doing heart surgery on us,
[1:16:37] right? How many of us h have have been
[1:16:40] in a service and the preaching of the
[1:16:42] word comes at us so straight that it
[1:16:45] starts uncovering things in our lives
[1:16:47] that we didn't even realize
[1:16:51] was there
[1:16:53] through the service. And that same thing
[1:16:56] happens. So what I what I want what to
[1:16:59] me what it means is when that second
[1:17:01] pool we saw it transition from the first
[1:17:04] into the second and it unlocks something
[1:17:07] within that sister she didn't know she
[1:17:09] had.
[1:17:13] But the beautiful thing is is in that
[1:17:15] third pool when that third pool happened
[1:17:19] and that word unlocked to that prophet
[1:17:22] it unlocked something in him
[1:17:25] friends it unlocked the mystery of his
[1:17:28] life cuz remember
[1:17:31] when when when that when that seal
[1:17:33] released and he he said remember he said
[1:17:35] he said it was the thing that I wondered
[1:17:38] my whole life.
[1:17:40] Right.
[1:17:42] What was it? What to me? I hope you
[1:17:45] understand.
[1:17:47] He wondered was he Malachi 4 or not? Was
[1:17:50] he Revelation 10:1-7?
[1:17:53] Was that him?
[1:17:55] But when that sword in the hand come and
[1:17:57] and the seals became revealed, he said,
[1:17:59] "It's the thing that I wanted my whole
[1:18:00] life."
[1:18:02] He didn't know if he was just going to
[1:18:03] be making a platform for another man to
[1:18:05] step on or not. But when that seven
[1:18:09] revealed, it unlocked what? The mystery
[1:18:11] of him.
[1:18:16] But listen, don't stop there. Praise
[1:18:20] God.
[1:18:23] Because the third pool
[1:18:26] should unlock the mystery in you.
[1:18:30] Amen.
[1:18:32] Cuz it's not what was the whole point of
[1:18:34] the third pool.
[1:18:36] It wasn't so brother Brandham could
[1:18:38] fish.
[1:18:41] The whole point of the third pool was to
[1:18:44] catch you.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:50] It's when this message comes into our
[1:18:53] life,
[1:18:55] it unlocks the mystery
[1:18:57] within you.
[1:19:00] You you have to see that you are that
[1:19:05] covenant fish
[1:19:07] when when when you listen to the seventh
[1:19:09] seal and brother Bam talks about the
[1:19:11] third pool. You have to realize mama
[1:19:14] that's me.
[1:19:17] When you listen to the three kind of
[1:19:18] believers and you're saying amen, amen.
[1:19:22] and you get to the pop quiz at the end
[1:19:23] of the message and brother Bram says if
[1:19:25] you still got the tape on and you ain't
[1:19:27] turned it off and you're in agreement
[1:19:29] you are a believer.
[1:19:31] You are a covenant fish.
[1:19:34] Come on, friends. You or or
[1:19:40] Well,
[1:19:44] well, I can I can kind of see
[1:19:48] back problems and
[1:19:56] well, you can remember he's the high
[1:19:58] priest of your confession. Amen. And he
[1:20:02] can only deliver as we confess.
[1:20:08] Do we want to live a million miles below
[1:20:10] our profession?
[1:20:12] No. We want to we want we want to attain
[1:20:16] to the prize.
[1:20:18] If if if that seventh seal will unlock
[1:20:21] the mystery in that prophet, then what
[1:20:23] ought this message ought to do to us?
[1:20:26] It ought to unlock the mystery of our
[1:20:28] lives. And if the whole thing is that
[1:20:31] God would become uh he'd create all of
[1:20:34] this world, everything we see so that he
[1:20:37] could touch and feel and then we realize
[1:20:40] that this message has come unto us and
[1:20:42] it's unlocked the mystery in our lives.
[1:20:45] What ought it do to us in our everyday
[1:20:47] individual lives? We ought to be the
[1:20:50] happiest people
[1:20:53] on the face of this earth. Amen.
[1:20:56] I don't I don't care what your bank
[1:20:57] account looks like.
[1:21:00] I don't care what bills you got. I don't
[1:21:03] care how old your car is, how rusted it
[1:21:06] is,
[1:21:08] what your what your salary is. It
[1:21:10] listen.
[1:21:12] If you have him, you have everything.
[1:21:17] But it just depends upon your vantage
[1:21:19] point.
[1:21:21] What
[1:21:23] are we looking at? Amen.
[1:21:27] And I ask you, what what are we trying
[1:21:29] to as we stand? What what are
[1:21:33] we trying to touch in this last day? Are
[1:21:36] we trying to make it in our own
[1:21:39] abilities? Musicians, as you come, are
[1:21:42] we trying to make it or are we going to
[1:21:45] let this word Are we going to let the
[1:21:48] sword of this word come down
[1:21:52] and divide? Because remember it was a it
[1:21:55] was a discerner
[1:21:57] right of the soul and the spirit and the
[1:22:00] joints and the mar of the bone that the
[1:22:03] king's sword was not meant just for the
[1:22:07] prophet
[1:22:09] because brother Brandham says that he
[1:22:11] was he he says he says in the seven
[1:22:14] seals he said Lord I pray that you'll
[1:22:16] help me sis if you if brother you play
[1:22:18] something soft he says I'm beginning to
[1:22:20] fade away Lord I know my days can't be
[1:22:23] too many more. I pray that you'll help
[1:22:26] me. Let me be true, Lord, and honest and
[1:22:28] sincere that I might be able to bear the
[1:22:30] message as far as it's ordained for me
[1:22:33] to bear. And then it comes to time that
[1:22:35] I must lay it down. When I get down to
[1:22:38] the river and the waves begin to come
[1:22:40] again, come in. Oh God, may I be able to
[1:22:44] hand this old sword over to somebody
[1:22:47] else that'll be honest with it, Lord,
[1:22:50] and will pack the truth.
[1:22:53] Grant it, Lord.
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:02] And I believe
[1:23:06] I believe
[1:23:08] that I'm preaching
[1:23:11] to those recipients
[1:23:14] that that prophet said would come.
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] because
[1:23:24] that he we may not naturally hold that
[1:23:26] tangible the king's but listen
[1:23:32] the sword is his word.
[1:23:35] Brother Brandham said it was the word in
[1:23:37] the hand
[1:23:39] and it takes a strong hand of faith
[1:23:43] to hold this promise. He said, "Brother,
[1:23:46] I've been holding it for years." Well,
[1:23:47] keep on holding. Amen. You know, I I I
[1:23:50] noticed one of the descriptions of that
[1:23:52] of that sword. Brother Bram said it had
[1:23:55] a guard over it,
[1:23:58] right? So, you know how perfect God is
[1:24:03] because remember what guards our faith?
[1:24:08] Cuz in order for us to hold this sword
[1:24:10] and will it against the ws of the devil,
[1:24:13] we have to be covered.
[1:24:16] And brother Brandham said it keeps the
[1:24:18] lances off of us and it's God's word
[1:24:21] that's covering us. It's protecting us.
[1:24:23] It's not in our own ability. It's
[1:24:25] nothing that we can do.
[1:24:28] It's only what we can yield ourselves
[1:24:29] to.
[1:24:31] Brother, brother Brenham tells us,
[1:24:33] Brother Bham tells us in this uh in this
[1:24:36] uh uh uh uh three kinds of believers
[1:24:40] when he's talking about David, he said,
[1:24:42] "David, nowhere to hit but that one
[1:24:45] little place when he dropped down his
[1:24:48] cover over his face. One place to hit
[1:24:51] was right here in his forehead." And
[1:24:54] before he could get with any distance to
[1:24:56] that giant, God directed the killing
[1:24:59] mark
[1:25:01] and slew the giant. See, God did it.
[1:25:06] Now, we notice he was a believer.
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:13] So, was it David's practice and ability?
[1:25:16] And
[1:25:18] no.
[1:25:20] No. Is it our prowess or how well we're
[1:25:23] going to study and we're going to really
[1:25:25] apply ourselves and we're going I'll
[1:25:27] listen to a message every night.
[1:25:31] And then we fall asleep.
[1:25:37] No,
[1:25:39] it it's going to take relationship.
[1:25:43] It's going to take relationship with
[1:25:44] Jesus Christ
[1:25:47] if we want to slay those giants that are
[1:25:49] in our lives. We we all fall short of
[1:25:52] the kingdom of God. I every one of us,
[1:25:54] right?
[1:25:56] But listen, if if if we have him, we
[1:25:59] have everything.
[1:26:01] And that giant that stands before us
[1:26:03] tonight,
[1:26:05] there's no way in our own ability we'll
[1:26:08] be able to slay him.
[1:26:11] But he can.
[1:26:13] He can.
[1:26:17] So, as we come to a close, bow our
[1:26:19] heads, maybe close our eyes,
[1:26:22] I just want to
[1:26:26] take a minute
[1:26:29] maybe uh
[1:26:32] maybe you could take just a little bit
[1:26:33] of time of inventory and
[1:26:38] ask yourself,
[1:26:42] Lord,
[1:26:46] Have you become untouchable,
[1:26:50] brother? Is is the busyiness of of Lady
[1:26:54] Oia got you so
[1:26:58] overwhelmed that there's no time to put
[1:27:01] on the apron
[1:27:03] and by the time you get home, you're
[1:27:04] ready to check out.
[1:27:07] Listen, I I I'm I am not standing in the
[1:27:10] seat of the scornful here because I've
[1:27:12] been there, too.
[1:27:14] But could we raise a hand and say, "God,
[1:27:16] I I need your help,
[1:27:20] sister." Maybe maybe you're overwhelmed
[1:27:22] and
[1:27:26] you got all this thing worked up in your
[1:27:29] mind.
[1:27:31] Could you raise a hand and say, "Lord,
[1:27:34] help me to set aside
[1:27:39] some time to touch your throne."
[1:27:45] Young brother, young sister,
[1:27:48] could we raise a hand to him and say,
[1:27:50] "Lord, I I need a new touch.
[1:27:54] I need a fresh
[1:27:57] feeling of your spirit.
[1:28:03] The old soldiers, brother, sister
[1:28:07] been fighting 20, 30, 40, 50 years in
[1:28:09] this Christian way.
[1:28:14] Maybe feeling a little left out and
[1:28:19] lonely and isolated.
[1:28:23] Could you raise a hand to him tonight
[1:28:25] and say, "Lord, I I need a renewing."
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:31] Look, this this life is not easy,
[1:28:35] but there's somebody here that can help
[1:28:37] us.
[1:28:39] If we just look to him,
[1:28:41] I'm sure he would walk our way. And
[1:28:45] could we open up our hearts and say,
[1:28:47] "Lord, I I'm standing in the need of
[1:28:49] prayer."
[1:28:52] Maybe just take a moment and search our
[1:28:56] lives and
[1:28:58] take inventory.
[1:29:02] If there's questions, let it let the
[1:29:04] answer come to you tonight that you can
[1:29:07] have that peace that passes all
[1:29:09] understanding.
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:17] I just encourage you to take this moment
[1:29:20] to
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:24] talk to him.
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:32] Precious Lord,
[1:29:38] truly
[1:29:39] we're so thankful, Lord, for
[1:29:43] the word that's been sent to us in this
[1:29:45] day.
[1:29:48] Lord, it's
[1:29:53] so precious
[1:29:58] that you've shined upon us your merited
[1:30:02] grace.
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:08] We're grateful,
[1:30:11] Lord, as my brothers and sisters
[1:30:15] look into the corridors of their heart.
[1:30:17] I pray that your great Holy Spirit would
[1:30:21] just walk alongside them and help them
[1:30:24] to see the errors
[1:30:28] of their ways.
[1:30:30] Lord, help me to see the errors of my
[1:30:32] ways.
[1:30:34] Lord, I I want to be your hands. And I I
[1:30:38] know my brothers and sisters, they want
[1:30:40] to be your hands. And Lord, we've raised
[1:30:43] our hands to you tonight in surrender,
[1:30:46] asking you to become possessors of our
[1:30:50] hands. Lord, that you would
[1:30:53] help us to surrender to you in such a
[1:30:56] way that
[1:30:59] we would be meat for the master's use,
[1:31:04] God. that
[1:31:07] we'd be able to set aside this world and
[1:31:10] the hustle and bustle and we'd be able
[1:31:13] to find quiet time to get alone and to
[1:31:16] renew ourselves and refresh ourselves in
[1:31:19] your presence.
[1:31:21] Lord that we'd take time to
[1:31:26] read and
[1:31:28] dedicate ourselves aresh
[1:31:31] seek your face.
[1:31:34] We know the day is far spent and
[1:31:38] uh there's so many things, so many
[1:31:41] channels that pull against us, Lord. But
[1:31:44] I pray that your channel would become
[1:31:46] clearer and clearer and become brighter
[1:31:49] and brighter.
[1:31:52] you see the needs of my brothers and
[1:31:53] sisters and I I pray for each one that
[1:31:57] you would hear that cry under that hand
[1:32:00] that was raised and hear their famous
[1:32:03] cry.
[1:32:06] God, we love you and we praise you and
[1:32:08] we just commit all we are into your
[1:32:10] hands and we ask all these things to be
[1:32:13] so in Jesus lovely name.

[1:35:06] Come soften
[1:35:09] my heart.
[1:35:13] Oh
[1:35:16] Lord,
[1:35:19] soften
[1:35:21] my heart.
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:25] Amen.
[1:35:27] I thank God that he keeps pulling us
[1:35:29] back to himself. And man, he loves us.
[1:35:32] He won't let us get tied up and tangled
[1:35:34] up in the world and too busy. But he'll
[1:35:36] remind us always and draw us back to
[1:35:38] himself. And I thank God for that. And
[1:35:41] this is why we come to church. This is
[1:35:43] why we have fellowship. This is why
[1:35:44] we're constantly in the word. We come,
[1:35:46] brother said, we don't come to see our
[1:35:48] good parts. We come to see our bad
[1:35:49] parts. Not that we were shown our bad
[1:35:51] parts, but we come to recalibrate the
[1:35:53] true north. Amen. We have our compass
[1:35:55] and we can walk and if we don't keep
[1:35:57] recalibrated to what's most important in
[1:35:59] life and why we're here and what God
[1:36:01] wants to do, we could start drifting.
[1:36:03] So, we come to church and God will use a
[1:36:05] brother like brother Gabe to come and
[1:36:07] take the word and dial us back to true
[1:36:09] north. So, we realize we're here for a
[1:36:12] purpose and God wants to use us every
[1:36:14] day and all the situations we find
[1:36:15] ourselves in. Some God wants to use
[1:36:18] somebody in every situation. Sometimes
[1:36:20] we're standing around looking around
[1:36:22] saying, "Man, I wish God would fix
[1:36:23] this."
[1:36:25] But maybe he wants to use us to fix it.
[1:36:28] Maybe we're the vessel he wants to use.
[1:36:30] Maybe we're the one he wants to use in
[1:36:31] the home and we're the one he wants to
[1:36:33] use in work. We're the one he wants to
[1:36:34] use in the church. And I just want to
[1:36:37] say, God, help me to be sensitive.
[1:36:38] Soften my heart so that I can be a
[1:36:41] vessel you can work through everywhere
[1:36:43] I'm at. Amen. I appreciate the word of
[1:36:46] God. I appreciate Brother Gabe. And I
[1:36:48] appreciate the opportunity to
[1:36:50] recalibrate,
[1:36:51] to be quiet, and say, "Hey, God, help me
[1:36:54] to shut out all this noise and come back
[1:36:56] to what's most important."
[1:36:58] Amen. We're going to ask uh we're going
[1:37:00] to pray. We're going to ask God's
[1:37:01] blessing over the word we heard to help
[1:37:03] us take it home. We're going to dismiss
[1:37:05] in prayer. Let's pray together. Lord, we
[1:37:07] thank you for what we've heard. Lord, as
[1:37:10] we dismiss, Lord, and we're going to
[1:37:11] leave this atmosphere soon and go home
[1:37:14] because Lord, there's things you've
[1:37:16] called us to a life. You've called us to
[1:37:18] live, Lord. As we go to bed and wake up
[1:37:21] and go do the things you've called us to
[1:37:22] do, that's what you want us to do, Lord.
[1:37:25] Because you've called us to be your
[1:37:28] hands, your feet, Lord, your mouth, your
[1:37:31] eyes. But you've called us to live a
[1:37:33] human life, Lord, so you can manifest
[1:37:35] through each one of us, whatever
[1:37:38] capacity we're in, wherever you called
[1:37:39] us to, whether home or at work or
[1:37:42] wherever. But Lord, we want to be more
[1:37:44] sensitive to that. that we want to be
[1:37:46] awakened to what you're doing inside of
[1:37:48] us for you're healing us, Lord. You're
[1:37:51] you're you're encouraging us. You're
[1:37:52] renewing us, Lord, so that you can use
[1:37:54] us. That you can use us to touch
[1:37:57] somebody else's life. That you can use
[1:37:58] us to shine light in a dark place. That
[1:38:01] you can use us as a solution to wherever
[1:38:04] the problems are. And God, we want to be
[1:38:07] dialed in. We want to be healed. We want
[1:38:09] to be corrected, Lord. We want to be
[1:38:11] encouraged. We want to be, we want to
[1:38:13] receive this word, Lord, so that it can
[1:38:15] do a work in us. So that you can use us
[1:38:17] to do a work in this world, a work in
[1:38:20] our workplaces, a work in our homes, a
[1:38:22] work with our families. We want to be
[1:38:25] those vessels that you can use. Dial us
[1:38:28] in, Lord, and make us more sensitive to
[1:38:30] the leading of your spirit. May we catch
[1:38:32] those nudges, Lord, that you're trying
[1:38:34] to move us along and use us for
[1:38:36] something or speak through us or help
[1:38:38] through us. May we become more sensitive
[1:38:41] to that, Lord. May we be dialed into
[1:38:44] your frequency that you can work through
[1:38:46] us easily, Lord, like you've done
[1:38:48] through all your children down through
[1:38:49] time. May we be dialed into that
[1:38:51] frequency of your word, of your life, of
[1:38:53] your spirit. And may we be vessels that
[1:38:56] you could work through. We pray you
[1:38:59] bless our brother Gabe. We thank you for
[1:39:00] his surrender. May you restore him and
[1:39:03] refresh him and replenish him and use
[1:39:05] him again. Lord, we all want to leave
[1:39:08] here, Lord, with these things in mind.
[1:39:09] And may we wake up still meditating on
[1:39:12] them, Lord. And may it change the way we
[1:39:14] we we focus, the way we look at the
[1:39:17] world and the day and our lives. We love
[1:39:20] you, God. We ask your blessings over all
[1:39:22] of these things as we dismiss and go.
[1:39:24] Keep your children safe along the way.
[1:39:26] And may you have preeminence amongst
[1:39:29] each of one of us. We pray in Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:39:35] all. Brother Riley, if you have a song.
