========================================

you can be scared amen and not scared you can be grieving and happy you can have joy amen the peace that passes all understanding but turmoil going on on the outside amen don't pay attention to the flesh pay attention to the soul amen your flesh will go up and down your flesh will be troubled your flesh will be distressed your flesh will be in pain your flesh will be tired your flesh will have doubts don't pay attention to the flesh we're a dual person we've got to dig down to to the inside and say God I'm a happy person I've got joy in my heart I know who I am and I know where I'm going my feelings are sad I've Got the Blues I can't seem to make myself laugh but it doesn't change anything in my life nothing has changed I'm still a Son of God I'm still glorybound I'm still seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus though I weep in my pillow at night till I fall asleep I'm still seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus nothing's going to change that I'm a dual person I can have dual emotions at the same exact time I can have a joy and a peace in my heart when everything in my life is unsettled and I can feel like I'm coming apart at the seams but the reality is nothing is wrong everything's fine and you feel it and the feeling is real but the real the real feeling is not the real [Applause] reality the real reality is the Heavenly reality the soul reality ity is what is true everything else is the vapor everything else is part of this life and we had to fall into this life we had to understand the backdrop of sin and perversion and Corruption and we had to feel the full gamut of it so that we would understand the grace and the love and the mercy and the peace that passes all understanding and while we're journeying through this life we're still stuck in cockabur on the outside and we've got things that are going to trouble us and so be it it's going to be there we're never going to get it to go away until these items change but praise God at the same time the worst day of my life I'm still seated in Christ Jesus in Heavenly places I'm still born again I still have the Holy Ghost I'm still Glory bound and these atoms are going to change someday and I'm not going to have to deal with this anymore this is a temporary problem and I'm willing to deal with the temporary problem as I'm passing through to the permanent position don't let the depression don't let the the the the troubles don't let the stress don't let the sickness don't let the weariness don't let any of it Rob you from the reality that's in your soul sometimes we have to rehearse those things to ourselves and remember no matter how bad it is on this side I'm a dual person there's another side to the story and I may not be able to feel it now but I'm not dependent on my feel feelings I'm dependent on the reality of God's word it's the truth even if I can't connect with it in my emotions it's still the truth you know there's sometimes you feel it with everything that's in you there's other times you don't feel it does it change anything it doesn't change anything
