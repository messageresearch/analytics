it was all one thing in the beginning the chinese laundrymen ticket he didn't give you two different tickets say i hope these go together he knew they would go together because they were one substance in the beginning and he took a portion off of this substance so that it would be an exact match and you were tore off the word for this day the bride age the manifestation of jesus christ in bride form that was the portion that was tore off of god that's the part of the word that is in you if you're a predestinated sea gene of god living in this day the part of god that's in you the part of the word that was broke off out of the book what is the book of life what are the believers the words in the book so one of those words had to come out of the book so he tore the word out of the book and he put it in you and what word is that it is the word it is the word for this day [Music] in the only way that he can wake up that word and get into action is to bring the word for this day to the word for this day no other word would work no teaching from a previous age no other doctrine no other theory no other philosophy will work only the word for this day coming to the word for this day and when they match [Music] it comes back to itself the prodigal son has come to himself and he's run to his father and his father's wrapped his arms around him brother man was teaching us to take the scare away you don't know who you are i i hope i have the baptism the holy ghost i hope that it's almost like i just hope that if i get a sensation or experience then i'll have enough confidence to believe that i'm a child of god the baptism of the holy ghost wasn't to give a sensation or or some feeling that you could put your put your stock in and put your hands around because every sensational experience every experience you have the devil will be able to make you question it but the badge of the holy ghost wasn't to give you a sensation or a feeling that you could lock on to the baptism of the holy ghost came to wake up the seed the portion of god that was laying there waiting to go into manifestation that is the purpose of the baptism of the holy ghost and the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost is that this seed word precedent predestination for this day comes to the word and says that's nothing but the truth and begins to live it and manifest it [Applause] not i had a feeling someday and i had something a dream and something this that may very well be how he came to you but it's it's it's christ coming to christ it's the holy ghost coming to the holy ghost it's spirit the spirit life to life word to word [Applause] so he may come in a dream and a sensation that may be how he comes and that's wonderful but the thing that gives us the evidence that has taken place is that this life comes back to the word it was tore off and said that's the truth i received the word for my day i know it's right because i was in the conference
