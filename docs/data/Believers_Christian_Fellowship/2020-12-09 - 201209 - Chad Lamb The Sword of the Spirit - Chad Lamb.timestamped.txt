[4:58] what has been hid from before the

[6:02] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[6:06] while we're standing let's just read a
[6:07] scripture together
[6:09] and then we can be seated
[6:10] [Music]
[6:12] revelation chapter 4
[6:17] and we'll start at verse 1 revelation
[6:19] chapter four
[6:20] i want to continue on just a little bit
[6:22] with the thought that we were on on
[6:23] sunday
[6:24] amen but i just want to look at a
[6:26] specific angle so we might
[6:28] review just a little bit and continue on
[6:30] by the grace of god
[6:32] revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[6:35] after this i looked and behold a door
[6:37] was open in heaven
[6:39] so after this after what after the
[6:41] church ages
[6:43] after laodicea after this i looked and
[6:45] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[6:48] first voice which i heard was as it were
[6:50] of a trumpet
[6:51] talking with me which said come up
[6:53] hither and i will show thee
[6:55] things which must be hereafter and
[6:57] immediately i was in the spirit and
[6:59] behold a throne was set in heaven
[7:01] and one sat on the throne amen it's
[7:04] amazing that
[7:05] after john passes through the church
[7:07] ages then after this
[7:09] he looked and there was a door open to
[7:10] heaven so after
[7:12] when he gets to the end of laodicea now
[7:15] there's an
[7:15] open door in heaven amen and now he can
[7:18] be lifted off the things on earth and to
[7:20] the things in heaven
[7:21] and and the first voice he heard was as
[7:23] a trumpet saying come up
[7:25] hither immediately he was in the spirit
[7:27] and he saw
[7:28] one on the throne he got a revelation of
[7:31] christ the mystery of god
[7:34] revealed the seventh seal amen you can
[7:37] be seated
[7:41] i'd like to just continue on brother
[7:42] branham says you know here in the vision
[7:45] of john he said one man can represent
[7:47] the whole church
[7:49] and he represents the whole church being
[7:51] caught up out of laodicea
[7:53] and into heavenly places amen and so
[7:57] we want to continue looking uh but today
[7:59] i'd like to focus just on the sword of
[8:01] the spirit
[8:02] so i just titled this just for a text
[8:04] the sword of the spirit
[8:05] and i want to read this quote out of um
[8:08] christ is the mystery of god revealed i
[8:09] read it on sunday but i'd like to read
[8:11] it again
[8:12] i mean sometimes when god is is is
[8:15] really
[8:16] opening something and we get moving so
[8:17] fast amen and it just
[8:19] it just you just can't hardly help it
[8:21] amen you get so inspired
[8:22] i mean sometimes i want to just go over
[8:24] it again i want to back up a little bit
[8:26] and just
[8:26] slow down so tonight if the lord will
[8:28] help me i'd like to slow down
[8:30] amen there's no promises but i'd like to
[8:32] slow down a little bit
[8:33] and read christ is the mystery god
[8:35] revealed paragraph 593
[8:37] oh if i could get the world to see that
[8:39] why there you are
[8:41] there is the body of christ living
[8:43] standing redeemed redeemed oh my
[8:46] justified in his sight why are we
[8:48] justified we
[8:49] are his victory the church is his
[8:52] victory
[8:53] oh i i i feel the same way as the
[8:56] prophet said he said
[8:57] oh if i wish i could get them to see it
[8:59] and i i say it this way i wish i could
[9:01] see it like i i ought to see it
[9:04] because it the the church is his victory
[9:07] the church is
[9:08] his victory amen the church redeemed the
[9:10] church standing on her feet
[9:11] the church walking in the fullness of
[9:13] the truth the church without deception
[9:16] the truth the church of me
[9:17] that is his victory that's the whole
[9:19] point that's this whole purpose
[9:20] that is his victory us here today
[9:23] receiving the word and walking in the
[9:25] full light of the day
[9:26] with the full holy ghost amen measured
[9:28] out in this day
[9:29] this is his victory friends
[9:33] and so it's it's it's i think it's more
[9:35] than we have ever imagined it's more
[9:38] important it's more precious it is the
[9:40] goal it is the purpose amen
[9:42] it is everything and and because it's
[9:44] our lives and because there's such a
[9:46] natural part of us
[9:47] i think sometimes we forget how
[9:49] significant this day
[9:50] is and how significant our lives are in
[9:52] this day
[9:54] i would say in in brother branham's life
[9:56] and we look back and we see
[9:58] what was happening through his ministry
[10:00] and how
[10:01] how perfect his life was ordained and
[10:03] and how his footsteps were ordered of
[10:05] the lord
[10:06] and so many of the the things that he
[10:08] went through and
[10:09] many of the things that he did in the
[10:10] circumstances around his life
[10:12] it was declaring the word it was
[10:13] declaring the age
[10:16] so everything surrounding that prophet's
[10:18] life was so
[10:19] ordained and so significant amen and
[10:22] i would say in the eternals in the
[10:24] invisible realm
[10:25] all around him amen there was such
[10:28] dramatic things taking place
[10:32] but i don't think our lives are any
[10:33] different
[10:35] i think if we could see into that unseen
[10:37] world amen if god
[10:39] if we could break through the barrier of
[10:40] flesh and actually see
[10:42] what's going on in the heavenlies and
[10:44] amen and what's what's taking place
[10:46] in the reality because this is not the
[10:48] reality
[10:49] this is the reflection this is the
[10:51] shadow this is the myth but if we could
[10:53] see in the reality
[10:54] i believe there's just as significant
[10:56] things taking place in the lives of the
[10:58] bride
[10:58] as there was then and so we want to be
[11:02] conscious of this that the church is his
[11:04] victory
[11:06] he wanted to achieve a church he had to
[11:09] restore what was fallen in eden
[11:11] amen because because he set up the
[11:13] pattern in eden
[11:14] amen he cannot deviate from that pattern
[11:17] so in order for god to have the victory
[11:20] he has to have a bride restored
[11:23] and that bride has to be restored in an
[11:25] eden condition
[11:26] and if he doesn't bring the bride back
[11:28] to an eden condition
[11:29] he has not succeeded and that's why
[11:32] the church is his victory amen because
[11:35] jesus christ came
[11:36] as the last adam and he had victory as
[11:39] the last adam but that is not yet a
[11:41] restoration to an even condition
[11:44] because without her amen he is not
[11:46] complete without her
[11:48] the vision is not fulfilled the pattern
[11:51] has not come
[11:51] back in the cycle of redemption back to
[11:54] the original desire
[11:55] amen until you have a bride that is
[11:57] brought back in
[11:58] union with her bridegroom in an eden
[12:01] condition
[12:04] praise be to god so the church is his
[12:06] victory
[12:08] we come forth in this last days with
[12:10] this glorious gospel
[12:12] showing his victory now his victory
[12:16] brother uh his god's victory christ's
[12:19] victory
[12:20] was not that he could get a man on the
[12:23] earth
[12:24] amen that could display the sign of the
[12:26] messiah
[12:30] right because that sign was to attract
[12:33] the attention
[12:34] of the bride of the rainbow covenant
[12:37] trout the
[12:38] the elect seed the elect bride amen so
[12:41] brother brando's ministry was not his
[12:43] victory
[12:46] and we look at that as such a victory
[12:49] i mean for us it was so victorious i
[12:52] mean night after night
[12:53] demons legions of demons were cast out
[12:56] there was a man amen that god had such
[12:59] control and such preeminence and that
[13:01] christ could come down himself
[13:02] and work through that flesh it was god
[13:05] in the flesh
[13:06] of that prophet and he was bringing
[13:08] every spirit in the building under his
[13:10] control
[13:12] it was such a victory such a display of
[13:14] the power of christ such a display of
[13:16] the sign of the messiah
[13:17] amen but that wasn't his victory his
[13:20] victory is you and i
[13:22] connected to this word believing with
[13:24] deception of melting away and coming
[13:26] back in union with our bridegroom
[13:28] that's his victory that was to get this
[13:34] so we look at that with admiration and
[13:36] awe
[13:37] and then and put it on a pedestal and
[13:39] there's nothing wrong with those things
[13:40] but we can't let it stop there that
[13:43] wasn't his great achievement his great
[13:45] achievement was to have a bride
[13:47] restored back to himself again
[13:50] this day is his great achievement what's
[13:52] happening now is his great achievement
[13:55] this is his victory
[13:58] him having preeminence in you and i is
[14:01] his victory
[14:02] that's why every day every decision
[14:05] attitudes
[14:06] thought amen conduct it matters because
[14:09] this is the day
[14:10] this is the goal this is the victory
[14:14] so we can't just leave it all on brother
[14:16] ben he had a consecrated life
[14:18] he had pre-eminence in that vessel that
[14:20] was wonderful i mean he was only
[14:22] foreshadowing he was the first one
[14:24] amen the first part of the word that
[14:26] would come to full harvest maturity
[14:28] and it was plucked up and waved over the
[14:30] people amen
[14:31] showing that whatever brought that first
[14:34] part to full harvest maturity will bring
[14:35] the rest of the grain
[14:37] to full harvest maturity so we cannot
[14:39] stop there and say
[14:40] i've seen it that's it whatever whatever
[14:43] mature
[14:44] that into a ripeness has got to mature
[14:46] us into a ripeness
[14:47] and if the rest of the crop doesn't come
[14:49] to ripeness it's a failure not a victory
[14:54] so this is his victory you and i are
[14:57] part of his victory
[15:00] he come forth in the last days with his
[15:01] glorious gospel showing his victory
[15:03] he died for this purpose and we are
[15:06] proof of his victory
[15:08] amen when we see him coming down and
[15:10] living among the church
[15:11] that's his victory shows that he
[15:15] he couldn't keep him in the grave
[15:16] neither can they keep us
[15:20] what grave what grave
[15:25] the grave of dead denominationalism
[15:29] neither can they keep us that's right we
[15:31] are already potentially arise
[15:33] because we've raised from the dead
[15:35] unbelief in his word
[15:36] from denominational creeds to an eternal
[15:39] word of the eternal god
[15:40] which is him his self working through
[15:44] us manifesting himself that he is the
[15:46] same yesterday
[15:47] today and forever and when the word
[15:51] moves on down into the body from the
[15:53] head what is it
[15:54] the same word nothing can be added or
[15:56] taken from it so that the same word
[15:58] moves from the head
[15:59] as the day comes close down into the
[16:01] body down into the body vindicating that
[16:04] they are one
[16:05] they are husband and wife their flesh of
[16:07] his flesh
[16:08] word of his word life of his life spirit
[16:10] of a spirit
[16:12] listen now now now that this is the
[16:14] words of a vindicated prophet amen and
[16:17] he's pointing right to the teachings of
[16:19] the apostle paul
[16:20] and he's telling us that in this end
[16:22] time amen under the opening of this word
[16:25] that the the head and the body have
[16:27] united and the life moving down from the
[16:29] head and to the body
[16:30] amen the husband and wife said that wife
[16:32] is their flesh
[16:34] of his flesh word of his word
[16:37] life of his life spirit of his spirit
[16:40] that is not second class that is not
[16:43] second rate
[16:44] that is not part two amen it's a
[16:46] continuation of the same thing
[16:48] whatever he is she must be awesome
[16:54] he he was that in in perfect flesh that
[16:57] wasn't fallen and wasn't sin born
[16:59] but we are that in redeemed flesh that
[17:02] was born wrong but redeemed back by the
[17:04] blood of jesus christ
[17:07] but it's got to be the same thing it
[17:09] can't be something different
[17:11] amen how do you know bears the same
[17:14] record same fruit
[17:15] same word manifest christ same life same
[17:18] god same spirit
[17:20] same word same book amen
[17:23] same signs the things that i do show you
[17:25] also oh hallelujah my
[17:28] notice the vindicated word in his body
[17:30] is his
[17:31] very victory and the reason of his death
[17:36] what did he die so that he could
[17:37] vindicate his word and you and i
[17:41] see the death now he goes on see the
[17:43] death not in the spirit
[17:44] when he died he only died in the flesh
[17:46] his spirit went to hell and preached to
[17:48] the souls in prison
[17:50] that right his flesh only died when he
[17:53] raised it up again and quickened it
[17:55] quickened means made alive his flesh
[17:58] which is his body
[17:59] so i want to stop and inject here that
[18:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[18:03] word was with god and the word was god
[18:05] amen john 1 1. then you go over to john
[18:08] 1 14
[18:09] but the word was made flesh and dwelt
[18:10] among us so god
[18:12] brother branham is getting ready to
[18:13] switch gears on us here but you got to
[18:15] catch the way he's going
[18:17] he's saying when he died he never died
[18:19] in the spirit he only died in the flesh
[18:21] amen what was his flesh his flesh was
[18:24] the word
[18:25] made flesh so that word was laying in a
[18:28] dead condition
[18:29] and after three days he raised it back
[18:32] to life
[18:32] but the spirit never died
[18:36] now look what he says next and that's
[18:38] and look
[18:39] his flesh which is his body and that's
[18:41] the word
[18:42] it's been laying dead for years
[18:47] it's been laying dead for years what's
[18:50] he talking about
[18:51] he's not talking about that body of the
[18:54] nazarene
[18:55] amen that was born in a stable in
[18:57] bethlehem
[18:58] he's talking about the body of his word
[19:01] which is the church
[19:04] and now he's saying that that now
[19:07] it's been laying dead for years but it
[19:10] gradually began to come in the
[19:12] reformation
[19:13] and now she is standing upon her feet
[19:17] [Music]
[19:20] praise be to god where is his body you
[19:22] are his body
[19:24] the church is his body and it's been
[19:26] laying dead for years he said
[19:28] but why he already foreshadowed it amen
[19:30] when that body which was the word made
[19:32] flesh
[19:33] it died amen the spirit didn't die but
[19:36] the body died amen
[19:38] the word was laying there but now after
[19:41] three days he resurrects it back to life
[19:43] and now uh uh and the in the message
[19:46] brother branham preaches of
[19:48] of the restoration of the bride tree he
[19:50] says it goes to joel to the caterpillar
[19:52] the palmer worm the cankerworm and the
[19:54] locust and he says
[19:55] four stages ate it down to nothing
[19:59] it died in the dark ages the words been
[20:02] laying their dead for years
[20:04] but gradually through four stages it
[20:06] become back to life again
[20:08] what is it it's the resurrection of the
[20:11] word bride
[20:13] amen this is so important to understand
[20:18] amen because because without this
[20:20] resurrection
[20:22] there is no hope for physical material
[20:24] of the earth to ever come in a
[20:26] resurrection
[20:28] this resurrection comes first
[20:33] so that's the word it's been laying dead
[20:35] for years but it gradually began to come
[20:37] in the reformation and now
[20:39] she is standing upon her feet
[20:42] she is standing upon her feet what's
[20:45] that
[20:45] the same word that he was
[20:48] that laid in the grave for three days
[20:50] that now amen
[20:52] after this one is laid in the grave from
[20:54] the dark ages amen in the third day
[20:56] he's going to resurrect it back to life
[21:00] oh how i wish i had time to go back into
[21:03] ezekiel and pull out them dry bones
[21:05] and show you said can these bones live
[21:07] again he said prophesy
[21:09] how can prophecy come only through the
[21:11] prophet it's the word of the lord
[21:13] hear ye dry bones the word of the lord
[21:16] and send you
[21:17] skin came upon them and they stood up a
[21:19] mighty army
[21:20] and began to march toward zion glory to
[21:22] god that's him
[21:24] that's him the victory what's him
[21:28] what's him it's that army that was
[21:31] laying there as
[21:32] dead dry bones amen that after prophecy
[21:35] come
[21:36] it restores back to life and becomes a
[21:38] mighty marching army
[21:39] marching the zion he said that's him
[21:42] that's him
[21:43] the victory watch him it's her
[21:46] standing upon her feet it's her coming
[21:49] in the resurrection
[21:53] let's go to ezekiel but the brother said
[21:56] he didn't have time but we've got
[21:58] time ezekiel chapter 37
[22:03] this is such a principle we've talked
[22:04] about before but we have got to
[22:06] understand that
[22:07] that this bride is now standing on her
[22:09] feet this is the resurrection
[22:12] this is the resurrection of the church
[22:14] now we have to understand
[22:17] that in prophecy when when
[22:20] when in the old testament when we have
[22:24] prophecy prophecy of a disbursement
[22:28] of israel israel had fallen away they
[22:30] were going to be dispersed and go into
[22:32] the nations or be carried into babylon
[22:34] or whatever the curse was he says but i
[22:36] will gather you again
[22:38] and i will bring you back to this place
[22:40] and you will be my people and you will
[22:42] be a nation
[22:43] and all of that but the people he's
[22:45] speaking to are not the people who come
[22:47] back
[22:49] you understand that sometimes these were
[22:51] thousands of years
[22:52] hundreds of years so the people that go
[22:55] are not the ones that come back
[22:58] but to god it's one nation it's one
[23:01] people one
[23:02] israel that one can pass away but this
[23:04] is a continuation of israel
[23:06] and when he gathers them back it's the
[23:08] same he said i
[23:09] cast you away i gathered you back but it
[23:12] wasn't the same
[23:13] individuals that was sent away that came
[23:15] back
[23:17] so when god looks at the church he looks
[23:19] at one church
[23:20] one bride through all ages and she gets
[23:23] dispersed amongst the denominations but
[23:25] he's promised to gather her back
[23:27] and i will bring you back and i will
[23:29] restore you back and i will resurrect
[23:31] you back and what is it it's the
[23:32] resurrection of the whole
[23:34] church but it is manifest in the bride
[23:37] at the end time
[23:38] the whole body of believing bride
[23:41] from the time of christ till now is
[23:43] represented here in the bride
[23:46] all heaven is here backing up this bride
[23:49] because brother man said if you're an
[23:50] ambassador amen if you're an ambassador
[23:52] from heaven
[23:53] all heaven is backing you up and heaven
[23:56] is consistent of the word
[24:01] we're not alone we're not alone
[24:06] amen look at ezekiel 37 verse 1.
[24:11] that's why i think this is so important
[24:13] to understand prophecy
[24:15] when god gathered back to dispersed he
[24:18] brought israel back
[24:20] to him it was the same israel that went
[24:22] that he gathered back
[24:24] he wasn't counting individuals he's
[24:26] looking at his bride because christ has
[24:27] one bride
[24:28] amen it's a many-membered body and it's
[24:30] been built from the hands to the legs
[24:32] it's been built all up amen from the
[24:34] from the first age all the way through
[24:36] has been the building of the bride it's
[24:37] one bride
[24:39] what happens the one happens to all
[24:43] that's why the whole bride fell away in
[24:46] the first
[24:46] age i wasn't there but i fell away with
[24:50] that church
[24:52] we got we were trapped in denomination
[24:55] we were trapped in bondage
[24:56] we were trapped under mis understanding
[24:59] teaching misinterpretation of the word
[25:01] we were all trapped because if the bride
[25:02] was trapped there you and i were trapped
[25:04] there too
[25:04] because they without us are not yet made
[25:06] perfect
[25:08] so there's a link that goes between the
[25:10] elect
[25:13] so now she's standing on her feet who
[25:15] well you know just a little part
[25:17] no she's standing on her feet
[25:20] the bride has come back it's the
[25:23] restoration of the bride tree
[25:27] so we don't want to marginalize what's
[25:28] happening and lose the significance of
[25:30] happening
[25:31] what's happening all right
[25:35] chapter 37 verse 1 the hand of the lord
[25:37] was upon me and carried me out in the
[25:40] spirit of the lord
[25:41] and set me down in the midst of the
[25:42] valley which is full of bones
[25:45] and caused me to pass by around about
[25:46] and behold there were very many in the
[25:48] open valley
[25:50] and lo were very dry and he said to me
[25:54] son of man can these bones live and i
[25:56] answered o
[25:57] lord god thou knowest again he said to
[26:01] me
[26:01] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[26:03] them o ye dry
[26:05] bones hear the word of the lord thus
[26:07] saith the lord god unto these bones
[26:09] behold i will
[26:10] cause breath to enter into you and you
[26:12] shall live and i will lay sin you upon
[26:14] you
[26:14] and will bring upon bring up flesh upon
[26:17] you and cover you with skin
[26:18] and put breath in you and you shall live
[26:21] and you shall know that i am the lord
[26:23] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[26:26] as i prophesied
[26:27] there was a noise and behold a shaking
[26:29] and the bones come together
[26:30] bone to his bone and when i beheld low
[26:33] the sinews and the flesh come upon them
[26:35] and the skin covered them above but
[26:37] there was no breath in them
[26:39] then said he unto me prophesy unto the
[26:42] wind
[26:43] now catch this this is prophesy
[26:47] again
[26:50] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[26:52] man and say to the wind thus saith the
[26:55] lord god
[26:56] come from the four winds o breath and
[26:58] breathe upon these slain
[27:00] that they may live so i prophesied as he
[27:02] commanded me and the breath
[27:04] came unto them and they lived and they
[27:06] stood up upon their feet
[27:08] an exceeding great army
[27:12] oh i want i i just hope that you can
[27:14] catch
[27:15] this i'm going to keep keep keep going
[27:17] here but listen
[27:19] they if they came back an exceeding
[27:22] great army
[27:23] then they've returned back or been
[27:26] redeemed
[27:26] back or the redemption cycle has brought
[27:29] them back to what they were in their
[27:31] original condition
[27:33] that means if they stood up a exceeding
[27:36] great army
[27:36] they went down an exceeding great army
[27:43] if it went down the bride of christ it
[27:45] comes back the bride of christ
[27:48] [Applause]
[27:49] if it was the bride three eight thousand
[27:51] the bride tree come back
[27:54] and now let's go to verse 11. i want to
[27:56] read 11 to 14.
[27:58] then he said unto me son of man these
[28:01] bones are the whole
[28:02] house of israel now listen closely
[28:06] these bones are the whole house of
[28:07] israel behold they say our bones are
[28:09] dried and our hope is lost
[28:11] we are cut off for for for our parts
[28:14] therefore prophesying saying to them
[28:16] thus saith the lord god behold all my
[28:18] people
[28:18] i will open your graves and cause you to
[28:21] come up out of your graves and bring you
[28:23] into the land of israel
[28:25] and you shall know that i the lord i
[28:28] i am the lord when i have opened your
[28:30] graves o my people and brought you up
[28:32] out of your graves
[28:34] and shall put my spirit in you and you
[28:37] shall live and shall
[28:38] place you in your own land then shall
[28:40] you know that i
[28:41] the lord has spoken it and performed it
[28:44] saith the lord
[28:46] now there's a natural spiritual
[28:47] fulfillment to this and the natural
[28:49] fulfillment we're seeing it brother
[28:50] branham pointed out to it amen there was
[28:52] a gathering of all the nations i will
[28:54] bring you out of your graves
[28:56] now listen ezekiel here is prophesying
[28:59] to a group of dispersed people and he's
[29:01] prophesying of a greater disbursement
[29:03] that will come
[29:04] and he says i will bring you out of your
[29:06] graves he will not bring the same ones
[29:08] he's talking to out of their graves
[29:12] the natural fulfillment which is going
[29:13] on today because israel is back a nation
[29:15] in their homeland again
[29:18] but he calls it israel to him it's the
[29:20] same
[29:22] even though it's different people i hope
[29:25] you can catch that
[29:27] and for us i'll bring you out of your
[29:29] graves what graves the graves of
[29:31] denominations
[29:32] amen they were scattered in the nations
[29:34] amen the bride was scattered in the
[29:35] denominations
[29:37] laying dead but he opened up the graves
[29:39] and he brought us back to our own land
[29:41] to our inheritance which is the word
[29:44] so this has already happened for the
[29:45] bride and it's happening
[29:48] for the jews now listen what brother
[29:50] brahm says in the restoration of the
[29:51] bride tree
[29:53] said four killers took it four
[29:55] messengers destroyed it
[29:56] four messengers of death took it away in
[29:58] dogmas
[29:59] four messengers of righteousness restore
[30:01] her back again
[30:03] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[30:06] wish we had time
[30:07] i gotta wrote down here but i have to
[30:09] miss that prophesy can these bones live
[30:11] what's the four stages of that coming
[30:13] forth of that church what's the four
[30:15] stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming
[30:17] forth
[30:18] but the life only come not when the
[30:20] sinew skin was on them
[30:21] but when the wind blowed upon them
[30:23] that's when that's when come
[30:25] back that fourth message of life
[30:28] pay attention to that one i will restore
[30:32] saith the lord hallelujah glory praise
[30:33] be to god
[30:34] the fourth light is to come that will
[30:36] bring forth the same signs watch
[30:38] justification brought back the pulp
[30:40] sanctification brought back the bark
[30:42] doctrine of holiness
[30:44] what brought back the leaf pentecostals
[30:46] what is it pentecostals leaves clap
[30:48] their hands
[30:49] joy rejoice pentecostals so he's showing
[30:52] us now in this prophecy
[30:54] of the restoration of the bride tree he
[30:56] said i will restore all that the palmer
[30:58] worm the cankerworm the caterpillar and
[31:00] locust have eaten
[31:01] he said i will restore that and he ties
[31:03] it together with ezekiel 37 the valley
[31:05] of dry bones and he connects these two
[31:07] prophecies together
[31:09] and both of these prophecies have a
[31:11] natural fulfillment to israel and a
[31:13] spiritual fulfillment to the bride
[31:17] and now he says now four stages he said
[31:20] what was the four stages that brought it
[31:21] back
[31:22] amen we know is the insects that ate it
[31:24] down but what brought it back
[31:25] amen it was bone to bone sin you in
[31:28] flesh amen
[31:28] standing upon an army but there was a
[31:30] fourth messenger of life a fourth
[31:32] message of life of four stages of the
[31:33] restoration
[31:34] that had to come back and he starts
[31:37] talking he says
[31:38] justification brought back the pulp and
[31:40] he's referring to luther's day amen
[31:41] and then and then then he says the
[31:44] second stage sanctification brought back
[31:46] to bark doctrine of holiness that's
[31:47] wesley's day
[31:48] and he says now what brought back the
[31:50] leaf pentecostals that's the third stage
[31:52] amen in the pentecostal age is the
[31:54] laodicean church age
[31:55] so now he's saying three messengers
[31:57] brought it back and he's typing it with
[31:59] ezekiel
[32:00] bringing back the bones the sinew the
[32:03] flesh
[32:04] standing there it's come
[32:07] back it's restored back but doesn't yet
[32:10] have the breath of
[32:12] right life so we come back through
[32:16] justification sanctification baptism of
[32:20] the holy ghost
[32:23] but in ezekiel there's another
[32:26] prophesying
[32:28] prophesy son of man this is the second
[32:30] time he prophesied
[32:32] prophesy son of man and speak to the
[32:34] four winds that they come
[32:35] amen and breathe the breath of life amen
[32:38] and he says what
[32:39] the fourth was the word itself
[32:44] the word and god are the self-same
[32:45] person
[32:47] it's christ amen the anointed word he
[32:49] says now the fourth was the word
[32:52] itself amen the word made flesh
[32:55] fruits are the proof of the resurrection
[32:56] sign that christ has
[32:58] finally after justification been planted
[33:00] sanctification been planted
[33:02] baptism of holy ghost organizations died
[33:04] out and christ has again
[33:06] centered himself like the cap of the
[33:08] pyramid first line justification
[33:11] sanctification baptism holy ghost then
[33:13] coming of the cap
[33:14] which is what the word itself
[33:18] which is the holy ghost himself which is
[33:21] the full life of the word
[33:23] himself which is christ himself which is
[33:25] god
[33:26] himself which is the life that's come
[33:28] back into the church
[33:31] and when god is looking at this
[33:33] restoration of the church
[33:34] amen he's looking at luther
[33:37] wesley pentecost and now the fourth
[33:41] message of life
[33:42] the word itself amen and when he's
[33:44] looking at this he's just looking at the
[33:46] restoration of the bride he's not saying
[33:49] this group and this part over here with
[33:52] a different inheritance and not really
[33:53] bride but kind of bright
[33:55] no it's all bride building building
[33:57] building building
[33:58] so now i mean we we benefit
[34:01] from luther's day we benefit from
[34:04] wesley's day
[34:05] we benefit from the bats of the holy
[34:07] ghost and the pentecostal revival
[34:08] we benefit from that we are part of that
[34:11] we were there in that revival
[34:13] we were part of that because we're part
[34:14] of the bride that's bride that was the
[34:17] bride life coming through
[34:18] it was him prophesying that he's going
[34:20] to bring us out of our graves
[34:22] and bring us back into our land amen and
[34:24] he's been doing it
[34:25] opening the graves bringing back from
[34:27] the feet amen to the legs to the thighs
[34:29] to the arm
[34:30] bringing all the way back to the cap to
[34:32] the headstone which is the word
[34:34] itself coming back
[34:37] and i would say according to what
[34:38] brother branham said she's standing now
[34:40] upon her feet the bride
[34:42] is back in the resurrection the bride
[34:47] is back
[34:51] amen and all of the bride is represented
[34:55] in this today
[34:56] and you and i praise god
[35:02] let's go to revelation 19.
[35:10] revelation 19 we'll read verse 11.
[35:25] now the same process
[35:29] that god has for his bride the prophet
[35:33] of god come and he declared
[35:35] that the word himself has come the
[35:37] headstone has come the capstone has come
[35:39] to cap off the pyramid he is he is
[35:42] telling us that he is here
[35:44] that this this has happened the great
[35:45] invisible union
[35:47] but but individually
[35:51] as individuals we all have to move
[35:53] through this process
[35:55] justification sanctification baptism
[35:57] holy ghost and then
[35:59] the life itself so we we all have to
[36:02] move through this process
[36:03] so when brother branham is the prophet
[36:05] here he's declaring that we've come back
[36:07] to this prophecy this is the fourth
[36:08] stage of life
[36:10] that doesn't mean i wasn't even born yet
[36:14] but yet the bride was standing on her
[36:16] feet but yet
[36:17] they come back to the fourth stage of
[36:19] life yet it was to come to the bride age
[36:22] even though i wasn't there yet but i was
[36:23] instrumental in this bride in this day
[36:26] but it already come back the bride
[36:28] universe would come back to this
[36:29] position
[36:30] but me bright individual had to move to
[36:32] this position
[36:34] does that make sense and that's what god
[36:36] is waiting for for the last member of
[36:38] the bride to make that
[36:40] transition to that position and so we're
[36:42] out there looking for the last bride and
[36:44] that last bride has to move
[36:45] through justification sanctification
[36:47] baptism the holy ghost
[36:48] and then amen to to the word itself the
[36:51] four stage of life
[36:52] christ injected in that life itself amen
[36:55] and then the rapture will go
[36:57] the rapture has come but then the
[36:59] rapture will go
[37:00] so now now we understand where we're at
[37:05] so it's not like we're looking for
[37:07] something else it's already happened
[37:08] it's already been declared what we're
[37:10] waiting for is each individual member to
[37:12] get to that same place
[37:14] but it's already happened it's already
[37:16] been declared there's been a prophet on
[37:17] the day and the transition says we've
[37:19] made the transition
[37:20] we've moved through the transition we're
[37:21] here she's standing on her feet
[37:23] we're back to the bride we're in the
[37:24] bright eyes this is the restoration of
[37:26] the bride tree
[37:28] so we're not waiting for something else
[37:29] to happen amen we're waiting
[37:31] for every attribute to catch up to this
[37:34] spot
[37:36] now revelations 19 11
[37:41] and i saw heaven open i think it's so
[37:45] significant we've we've got to the point
[37:47] where every word matters
[37:49] every jot every tittle and even when we
[37:52] read it and we don't understand it
[37:54] i know that that semicolon means
[37:57] something
[37:58] even if i don't yet clearly understand
[38:00] what it is we've got to the place where
[38:02] we know that this word is perfect
[38:04] and it's written a certain way for a
[38:05] certain reason and now we've come
[38:07] to heaven being opened something opened
[38:10] heaven amen and we saw it open in
[38:12] revelation chapter 4
[38:14] and it was the opening of heaven and i
[38:17] saw heaven
[38:18] open and behold a white horse and he sat
[38:21] upon him was called
[38:22] faithful and true and in righteousness
[38:25] he did judge and make war his eyes were
[38:27] as a flame of fire
[38:29] and on his head were many crowns and he
[38:32] had a name written that no man knew but
[38:34] he himself
[38:35] and he was clothed in a vesture dipped
[38:36] in blood and his name is called the word
[38:38] of god
[38:40] and the armies which were in heaven
[38:42] followed him upon white horses
[38:44] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[38:47] and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[38:49] that with it he should smite the nations
[38:52] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[38:53] iron and he treadeth the winepress of
[38:55] the fierceness and the wrath of almighty
[38:57] god
[38:58] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[39:00] thigh a name written
[39:02] king of kings and lord of lords
[39:05] amen so we we see this is the lord
[39:08] coming in glory
[39:09] heavens have opened and we see him
[39:10] coming with the armies of heaven
[39:12] and his name is the word of god and we
[39:15] know that
[39:16] that he's coming as the fullness of the
[39:18] word amen
[39:21] and so and the armies of heaven are with
[39:23] him and he's got
[39:24] and he's got a vester dipped in blood
[39:26] he's got a name written and no man knows
[39:28] but his name is called the word of god
[39:30] amen
[39:31] and so and he's got a sword that
[39:32] proceeds out of his mouth
[39:34] and we know all of this is symbolic and
[39:36] we talked about this sunday
[39:37] we're not going to go into all of that
[39:39] but i want to look at the sword
[39:41] and i want to go to the fourth seal he
[39:44] says
[39:44] in the fourth seal and he's got wrote
[39:47] life riding on a white horse
[39:50] and here's a man with three different
[39:51] powers mixed up called death
[39:53] gathered as earthbound delegates i want
[39:56] to go back to revelation chapter 6.
[39:58] let's look at this together
[39:59] because i want to take time so we're
[40:02] going to make ourselves stop and read
[40:04] revelation chapter 6 verse 1 in the
[40:07] opening of the seals here
[40:09] in chapter 6 it says and i saw when the
[40:11] lamb opened one of the seals and i heard
[40:13] as it were the noise of thunder
[40:14] one of the four beasts saying come and
[40:16] see and i saw and behold as a white
[40:18] horse and he that sat on him
[40:20] had a bow when a crown was given unto
[40:22] him and he went forth conquering and to
[40:24] conquer
[40:25] so we're going to go through four the
[40:27] first four seals
[40:28] we're going to see that there's somebody
[40:30] riding on a horse and he starts on a
[40:32] white horse moves to a red horse
[40:34] moves to a black horse and brother bram
[40:36] said it's the same writer all the time
[40:38] he's just changing the horse that he's
[40:40] riding on
[40:42] and i also want to note just through
[40:44] those so we can keep our minds
[40:46] in tune that that when he gets off of
[40:48] the white horse
[40:50] they get onto a red horse the white
[40:52] horse doesn't stop
[40:53] writing brother brenner said that rides
[40:55] all the way into eternity
[40:58] so coming like christ looking like
[41:00] christ but being a deceiver to try
[41:03] to trick the people looking like it's
[41:05] righteous but unrighteous
[41:06] that deception continues on today
[41:10] then he moves to the red horse and he
[41:11] takes up a sword and he begins to fight
[41:13] amen to force people to believe his
[41:16] doctrine and to kill those who don't
[41:17] believe his teachings amen and that's
[41:20] that that power that horse rides on
[41:22] today
[41:23] and he got off of that and he got onto
[41:25] the black and then he got onto the pail
[41:27] but when he gets onto the pail in the
[41:29] fourth stage because the fourth stage is
[41:31] always the declaration
[41:34] because the fourth stage of life
[41:36] declares who's here
[41:38] the word himself the fourth stage
[41:43] i'd say of death and let's read it in
[41:46] verse 7.
[41:49] and when he had opened the four seal i
[41:51] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[41:52] come and see
[41:54] and i looked and behold a pale horse and
[41:56] his name that sat on him was
[41:57] death and hell followed him this is the
[42:00] first time the horse
[42:02] rider has been given a name amen and
[42:04] that's his name of the horse rider from
[42:06] the beginning
[42:07] all the way through his name is death
[42:10] amen and brother branham's saying
[42:12] now he's preaching in the fourth seal
[42:14] now he says now
[42:15] he he goes he's contrasting this horse
[42:18] rider
[42:19] with the horse rider in revelation 19
[42:21] which is christ
[42:22] and he's comparing these two right now
[42:24] he said he's got wrote life
[42:26] how does he got wrote life when you go
[42:28] read revelation 19
[42:30] it doesn't say he's god wrote life on
[42:32] him
[42:33] it says that his name is called the word
[42:36] of god
[42:37] and he said the word is life amen the
[42:39] word is god which is eternal life which
[42:42] is zoe it's his word because the word
[42:44] was god and the word was with god
[42:46] amen so now when he says he's got word
[42:47] he says now his name is life
[42:51] he's got life riding on a white horse
[42:53] and here's a man with three different
[42:54] powers mixed up called
[42:56] death gathering his earthbound delegates
[42:58] and christ is gathering as heaven-born
[43:00] subjects
[43:01] saints he's got death wrote on him
[43:04] christ got life wrote on him
[43:06] those with him are on white horses also
[43:08] and they are called the chosen before
[43:10] the foundation of the world
[43:12] and they are faithful to the word amen
[43:15] oh
[43:15] i like that called chosen before the
[43:19] foundation of the world
[43:20] then faithful to the word by their own
[43:22] choosing
[43:24] did you catch that they were called the
[43:27] ones that were following them on white
[43:28] horses were called
[43:30] and they were also chosen called and
[43:33] chosen
[43:34] has nothing to do with the individual
[43:36] that's falling on the white horse
[43:37] that's something god did before the
[43:39] foundation of the world but look at that
[43:41] third
[43:41] title that they have they are also
[43:43] called faithful and brother behind said
[43:45] faithful by their own free moral
[43:48] agency faithful by their own choice
[43:52] they are called they are chosen and they
[43:55] are
[43:56] faithful praise be to god
[44:00] i want to be faithful by my own choosing
[44:04] chosen before the foundation world and
[44:05] then faithful to the word by their
[44:07] choosing
[44:08] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[44:10] just riding right along
[44:11] coming down to meet him they know the
[44:13] thunders will issue the thing course
[44:15] pretty soon see
[44:17] watch how does he do so if he's the word
[44:20] in his name is the word then the word is
[44:23] life
[44:24] the antichrist anti is against so anti
[44:27] is against the christ the word
[44:29] so it's got to be a creed or a
[44:31] denomination which is against the word
[44:33] why i don't see how you're going to miss
[44:35] it do you understand
[44:37] how could you miss it i don't know how
[44:39] you're going to do it but that's
[44:40] true anti is against isn't that right
[44:43] take a
[44:44] take away from that's what he had was
[44:46] he's riding his mixed up horse we see it
[44:49] right here in the word of god
[44:50] we see it right here right there in the
[44:53] seven church ages
[44:54] here he brings it right back and the
[44:56] seals opening up
[44:58] and showing them things that that's went
[45:00] on in the church ages
[45:01] anti is against the word see why
[45:05] creeds why are we so against creeds and
[45:07] denominations because they are against
[45:09] the word
[45:10] here we see life and death coming to the
[45:13] final struggle what in the
[45:16] fourth stage under the fourth horse
[45:19] rider
[45:20] death amen what's he doing he's leading
[45:23] the church to spiritual
[45:24] death amen and where where is christ
[45:27] leading them
[45:27] christ is leading them to life he is
[45:29] life he is the word and the word is life
[45:32] and so now you see life and death coming
[45:35] to their
[45:35] he said their final struggle amen and
[45:38] i'd say the final struggle is going on
[45:40] now
[45:44] life and death coming to the final
[45:45] struggle the white horse of true life
[45:47] the pale horse of mixed creed you see
[45:50] the thing coming
[45:51] to a real showdown
[45:54] now now listen in the fourth stage
[45:58] when the message of life has come there
[46:00] come an opening of the seals that
[46:02] reveals the full mystery of god
[46:05] and the full mystery of god is life
[46:09] and anything that's against that
[46:12] is death i i want you to understand
[46:17] how real this is and how important this
[46:20] is
[46:20] because the fourth message is life the
[46:22] fourth message of life
[46:24] the fourth stage is the word itself and
[46:26] the word itself is
[46:28] come and the word itself is here and
[46:30] it's the full manifestation of the word
[46:32] which is the mystery of god revealed
[46:34] which is
[46:35] christ the mystery of god revealed which
[46:37] was the preaching of the seals that took
[46:39] the mystery off the whole bible
[46:42] to find christ in the whole bible and
[46:44] anything that's against
[46:46] that revelation of this end time
[46:49] revelation of christ
[46:50] is death and will bring death
[46:57] i hope that's clear
[47:01] so it's a face-off between life and
[47:03] death and anything that's against this
[47:05] life is anti
[47:13] praise god and the invisible union of
[47:16] the bride of christ says but you
[47:18] remember
[47:19] when it went down and the grain began to
[47:21] ripen that you find before that grain
[47:23] can
[47:24] ripen everything in that stalk has to be
[47:27] dead
[47:28] so he's talking about the stalk of the
[47:30] wheat plant or the corn
[47:32] it comes up and it grows from luther
[47:33] wesley to pentecost comes the tassel
[47:35] then it comes to grain
[47:37] but before the life can move all the way
[47:39] into the grain which is the fourth stage
[47:41] of life which is the restoration of the
[47:43] bride tree
[47:43] which is the bride in the resurrection
[47:45] on her feet now before that can come
[47:48] everything in the stalk has to be dead
[47:52] come to the fourth stage under the
[47:54] fourth steel amen move from white horse
[47:56] to red horse
[47:57] the black horse now to pale horse to
[47:59] death so now
[48:00] life is only in the grain
[48:04] there's no going to denominational
[48:06] systems for life
[48:07] life is only in the grain everything in
[48:11] the system is dead
[48:13] amen the pale horse has been riding for
[48:16] two thousand years and is riding
[48:17] wrote all those subjects to death
[48:20] eternal
[48:21] separation from god
[48:26] so that's it has to be death before the
[48:28] grain can ripen everything in the stalk
[48:30] has to be dead and that's true for us
[48:33] friends everything in our old stock
[48:36] thinking
[48:39] everything in our old denominational
[48:41] ways and the things that we had been
[48:43] taught since we were children and we
[48:44] thought were
[48:45] cold hard fast but go contrary to what
[48:48] the prophet of god brought us
[48:50] amen everything in the old stock has to
[48:52] be dead
[48:53] amen we've got to come to the fourth
[48:55] stage of light which is the true
[48:57] revelation of this word
[48:58] and anything that was misunderstood
[49:00] coming through justification
[49:02] and sanctification and the baptism holy
[49:04] ghost now has got to move into the
[49:05] message of life
[49:06] which is the revelation of this hour and
[49:09] everything else has to be dead
[49:15] hallelujah can't you see where we're
[49:17] standing
[49:19] life is in the grain again if life is in
[49:22] the grain again
[49:23] everything else is dead
[49:28] what is it just exactly like the same
[49:31] grain that went in the ground
[49:32] the same jesus in bride form
[49:36] where is life where is that fourth stage
[49:39] of life
[49:40] where is the the resurrection of the
[49:43] mighty marching army in ezekiel 37
[49:45] where is it it's the same jesus in
[49:48] brideform
[49:49] amen if you want to look for the ripe
[49:51] and grain it's in bride form if you want
[49:53] to look for the fourth message of life
[49:55] it's in bride form
[49:56] if you want to look for the white horse
[49:58] rider it's in bride form
[50:03] because the white horse rider is the
[50:04] holy ghost
[50:06] so prophet said in the fourth seal the
[50:08] white horse the great white horse rider
[50:10] the holy ghost and the holy ghost
[50:14] is here in the bride been loosed
[50:18] by the evening time message in the
[50:20] evening time by the end time message the
[50:22] holy ghost back in the church again
[50:24] the fourth stage of life the message of
[50:26] life
[50:28] same grain that went in the ground the
[50:30] same jesus
[50:32] in bride form that's why they're
[50:35] hollering and don't get nowhere
[50:38] they don't know his new name under this
[50:40] victory of redemption
[50:42] they don't know where he's at but it's
[50:44] the same jesus
[50:46] in brideform the restoration of the
[50:49] bride tree the bride has come back
[50:51] he's brought the bride back into her
[50:53] position and united with her
[50:55] amen and that life now is in her
[51:00] the same jesus in bright form same power
[51:03] same church same thing same word
[51:07] the same word sucked up through these
[51:09] and come out here and come to a head
[51:11] here
[51:11] and all that life that come through here
[51:13] picked up its people
[51:14] now it's forming up into the head for
[51:17] the rapture
[51:19] let's go to revelation chapter 10.
[51:34] this is why i say when brother branham
[51:36] was here
[51:38] he was the word made manifest do we
[51:41] believe that
[51:43] he was the very word of god the prophecy
[51:46] now in
[51:46] flesh and that prophecy in malachi 4
[51:50] amen was now in flesh the prophecy in
[51:52] luke 17 30 was now
[51:54] in flesh the prophecies that have been
[51:56] laying there of a forerunner
[51:58] was now in flesh when jesus says elias
[52:01] shall surely come shall first come amen
[52:04] he was standing there manifesting that
[52:07] promise that jesus made
[52:09] he was the word made flesh
[52:13] but he was coming to forerun a coming
[52:18] and and now i would say that coming is
[52:22] in flesh
[52:24] there there is the same jesus in bride
[52:27] form
[52:28] in flesh that word is in flesh
[52:31] it's the manifested word for this hour
[52:33] and that life is poured into that
[52:35] flesh that flesh manifestation of the
[52:37] word
[52:38] and so we say john the baptist his
[52:41] ministry when that word was made flesh
[52:42] it was significant everything in his
[52:44] life was significant everything around
[52:46] him mattered amen the whole
[52:48] heavens the whole plan of god was moving
[52:50] around that individual
[52:52] would you agree when brother branham was
[52:54] here it was the word made flesh
[52:56] and everything in his life was
[52:57] significant and everything in the
[52:59] heavenlies was moving around that
[53:01] manifestation of the word
[53:02] it was indicating the time they were in
[53:04] amen it was the move of god that was on
[53:07] [Music]
[53:08] but we got to take it to our day we
[53:10] can't leave it there amen everything in
[53:13] the heavens
[53:14] everything the battle between life and
[53:16] death is going on around the manifested
[53:18] word amen
[53:19] because that's where christ is is in the
[53:22] manifested word the word for this hour
[53:24] the word that is taking on flesh and
[53:27] manifesting itself out in flesh
[53:29] that's where the battle is that's where
[53:30] the struggle between life and death is
[53:32] that's where all heaven and hell is
[53:34] meeting amen because he's anti-word he's
[53:37] anti-this manifestation of jesus christ
[53:40] in the formation of his bride that's
[53:43] where that messenger of death
[53:45] is trying to get to trying to diminish
[53:48] trying to discredit god's word
[53:53] praise be to god i hope by the time
[53:56] we're done
[53:56] that'll be a such a fact amen there
[53:58] won't be something in our mind that
[54:00] we're wondering about to be such a fact
[54:02] amen that 200 000 000 demons were
[54:04] unleashed
[54:05] amen and they come out of the euphrates
[54:07] in the sixth seal amen but in the sixth
[54:10] vial
[54:10] they crossed over into the religious
[54:13] realms
[54:14] because the waters had dried up and
[54:16] brother branham tells us
[54:17] what's happening he said the religious
[54:19] system was still holding it
[54:20] they couldn't get in to all the
[54:22] protestant churches that old babylonian
[54:24] religion the kings of the east
[54:26] amen the catholic religion couldn't
[54:28] merge over and move in
[54:30] to start taking over the promised land
[54:33] taking over in the church
[54:34] because euphrates still had water in it
[54:37] but under the sixth seal they could come
[54:39] out and he said where did they go
[54:41] into the armies of hitler mussolini and
[54:43] stalin and brought a bitter persecution
[54:46] against the jews
[54:47] but after the war where did they go amen
[54:51] he shows us
[54:52] it's the sixth vial they're crossing
[54:54] over now
[54:55] into the ecclesiastical realm the
[54:58] catholics are now that
[54:59] spirit i hope you don't think it's just
[55:03] some backroom meeting where the pope is
[55:05] meeting with the head of the lutheran
[55:07] and now it's a spirit that was moving in
[55:10] because there's no word to keep it out
[55:12] there's no barrier
[55:14] and now that spirit is moving in that
[55:16] spirit of idolatry amen
[55:18] is now moving in to the protestant
[55:20] church and taking over
[55:23] and he said where are those demons that
[55:26] are moving in
[55:26] they moved in to the armies of hitler
[55:29] mussolini and stalin
[55:30] amen they weren't trying to destroy the
[55:33] armies of hitler mussolini and stalin
[55:36] they were moving into those armies to
[55:38] destroy
[55:39] the elect chosen people of god now
[55:42] the spirit of the kings of the east are
[55:45] moving in
[55:46] to the religious from the ecclesiastical
[55:48] not to destroy the ecclesiastical realm
[55:50] but to use those armies of protestant
[55:52] catholics to destroy the elect chosen
[55:54] people of god
[56:01] and the first attacks are spiritual amen
[56:05] teaching against the word contradicting
[56:07] the word
[56:08] trying to bring confusion on the word
[56:13] spirits moving in ecclesiastical realms
[56:17] not physically trying to kill you
[56:20] spiritually trying to kill you
[56:22] not physically arresting you and bonding
[56:24] binding you but spiritually binding you
[56:27] into the prison house
[56:30] he said where do those spirits go amen a
[56:32] loose upon the church now
[56:34] loosed upon the bride
[56:37] but they'll never accomplish their goal
[56:41] because god has another plan for his
[56:43] bride
[56:45] revelations chapter 10 verse 7
[56:50] but in the days of the voice of the
[56:52] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[56:54] sound
[56:54] the mystery of god should be finished as
[56:56] he hath declared to his servants the
[56:58] prophets
[56:59] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[57:00] spaking to me again and said go
[57:02] and take the little book which is open
[57:04] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[57:06] upon the sea and upon the earth
[57:08] and i went into the angel and i said
[57:09] unto him give me the little book
[57:11] and he said unto me take eat take it eat
[57:13] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[57:15] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[57:17] honey
[57:18] and i took the little book out of the
[57:20] angel's hand and ate it up
[57:22] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[57:24] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[57:26] was bitter
[57:27] and he said to me thou must prophesy
[57:29] again
[57:30] before many peoples and nations and
[57:33] tongues
[57:34] and kings prophesy
[57:38] again
[57:41] what message the fourth message of life
[57:45] the breath of life to come into the army
[57:48] brother branham already did this the
[57:52] prophet of god
[57:53] had to eat that book and prophesy again
[57:56] he ate the book and the seals and after
[57:57] the ministry after the seals
[57:59] it was prophesy again but the bride has
[58:03] to follow the same pattern
[58:10] i'm going to read a super familiar
[58:12] portion of the
[58:13] of the message out of the church age
[58:15] book in the laodicean church age
[58:18] it says yes sir the church is no longer
[58:20] the mouthpiece
[58:22] of god it is its own mouth be so god is
[58:25] turning on her
[58:26] he would confound her through the
[58:28] prophet and the bride
[58:30] i hope you can catch that the prophet
[58:31] and the bride
[58:34] for the voice of god will be in her
[58:40] yes it is for it says in the last
[58:42] chapter of revelation
[58:43] verse 17 the spirit and the bride say
[58:46] come
[58:47] now now this is a simple statement the
[58:49] spirit and the bride say come
[58:51] but this simple statement has such huge
[58:53] impact because the simple statement
[58:55] means you cannot stay where you are
[58:58] and be safe you cannot stay in where you
[59:01] are and be okay
[59:02] you cannot stay where you are because
[59:04] where i am
[59:05] is where the spirit is because the
[59:07] spirit and the bride are speaking
[59:08] together
[59:09] amen they're speaking simultaneously
[59:12] and the spirit we know is speaking
[59:14] through the bride and the spirit and the
[59:16] bride is saying come
[59:17] what are they saying come to come to the
[59:19] water of the fountain of life
[59:20] and drink freely so what they're saying
[59:22] is i
[59:24] am at the fountain of life i am with the
[59:26] fountain of life
[59:27] amen you cannot stay where you're
[59:31] at amen do you realize what the message
[59:33] of the bride is
[59:34] the message of the bride in this day is
[59:36] not you are all fine
[59:38] everything's okay don't worry about it
[59:40] just live a nice clean life
[59:41] the message of the bride is come leave
[59:44] the denominations leave the graves
[59:46] amen gather back into the homeland you
[59:49] can't stay
[59:50] where you're at and be okay
[59:55] we got to be careful what our message is
[59:57] and preach it the right way
[59:58] amen we know that there's an ordained
[1:00:00] foolish virgin i know that and ordained
[1:00:02] 144 000
[1:00:03] and they will be given life amen at the
[1:00:06] white throne judgment
[1:00:07] not previously having it they don't have
[1:00:09] it the only way to have it now
[1:00:11] is to come to this water only place to
[1:00:15] get it friends
[1:00:16] amen so we're not diminishing from there
[1:00:18] is a there is a group amen
[1:00:20] that will receive life at the white
[1:00:22] throne judgment they have their place
[1:00:23] we're not taking from them
[1:00:24] but our message is not a foolish virgin
[1:00:27] message
[1:00:28] we're not here to say you're fine there
[1:00:30] stay there you're okay there
[1:00:32] amen the only message that i got in this
[1:00:35] bible is come
[1:00:37] come leave the nation leave the
[1:00:39] denomination
[1:00:41] it's got death throat on the door
[1:00:42] ichabod's over the door
[1:00:44] you can't stay there anymore you have to
[1:00:47] come
[1:00:47] to the water of life and drink if you
[1:00:50] want life
[1:00:54] i think sometimes in the message we got
[1:00:56] afraid of our message
[1:00:58] we got afraid to preach the message
[1:01:00] that's given us in the scriptures
[1:01:01] amen what the prophet told us we started
[1:01:03] preaching a message that was palatable
[1:01:05] and nice
[1:01:06] and you've got your place i've got my
[1:01:07] place and that's not saving anybody
[1:01:10] friends
[1:01:11] that's not helping anybody people have
[1:01:13] to know the truth amen
[1:01:15] there is no ark outside of this word
[1:01:19] there is no water of life outside where
[1:01:21] the spirit and the bride are drawing
[1:01:23] people too
[1:01:25] which is the water coming from the
[1:01:26] throne of god
[1:01:29] so we cannot water down our message we
[1:01:31] cannot
[1:01:32] compromise our message we have to stick
[1:01:34] with the message that's given us in the
[1:01:36] bible
[1:01:36] amen we're supposed to eat the book and
[1:01:39] prophesy again
[1:01:40] what does prophesy again mean that does
[1:01:42] not mean a new prophecy
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:47] if somebody says i'm the bride i'm
[1:01:48] prophesying again i've got some things
[1:01:50] brother branham didn't get to
[1:01:51] that's not the bride because the bride
[1:01:54] has to prophesy against is she's got to
[1:01:56] prophesy what's already been said
[1:02:00] they're under their messenger not beside
[1:02:03] or above they're
[1:02:04] under their message and so
[1:02:07] our duty is to say what the tapes say
[1:02:12] to preach the message that the prophet
[1:02:14] brought
[1:02:17] not the message that's comfortable
[1:02:20] not the message that sounds nice not the
[1:02:23] message that makes people feel good
[1:02:25] but the message out of the bible come
[1:02:29] it's so simple it's so simple till you
[1:02:31] go to do it
[1:02:34] it's simple here and in the 17th verse
[1:02:37] of chapter 22 of revelation it's simple
[1:02:39] the spirit and the brightest they come
[1:02:40] we say amen
[1:02:41] you go to your neighbor and say come you
[1:02:43] can't stay baptized you can't stay
[1:02:44] luther
[1:02:45] you've got to come if you want life if
[1:02:47] you want to get in the ark
[1:02:48] if you want to connect to jesus christ
[1:02:50] today you've got to come
[1:02:51] drink of the water of life
[1:02:55] it's a big deal friends it's a big
[1:02:57] message
[1:03:00] he says he says the spirit and the bride
[1:03:03] say come once more the world will hear
[1:03:05] direct from god
[1:03:08] that message is direct from god
[1:03:12] the spirit and the bride for she is
[1:03:15] his mouthpiece his voice is in her
[1:03:21] but of course that word bride will be
[1:03:23] repudiated as in the first age
[1:03:27] if you've not been repudiated yet i i
[1:03:30] beg you to check your message
[1:03:35] it's the truth friends
[1:03:40] if you say i can preach the message in
[1:03:41] such a way it doesn't cause any offense
[1:03:43] to a denominational believer
[1:03:45] you're not preaching the message
[1:03:48] it's just not the message
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:53] oh lord that'll get me in all kinds of
[1:03:55] trouble but it's it's the truth anyhow
[1:03:57] friend
[1:03:58] it's the truth anyhow
[1:04:02] amen the seed shall not be heir with the
[1:04:04] shock but the original interpretation of
[1:04:06] this word
[1:04:07] he that understands my word and will
[1:04:09] believe on him that sent me
[1:04:10] he that understandeth that is he it's
[1:04:13] been made known to
[1:04:16] brother man it's typing this he's not
[1:04:18] saying he that heareth that you just
[1:04:19] heard the word you
[1:04:20] did you hear what that preacher's saying
[1:04:21] yeah i heard him he said that's not it
[1:04:23] to see that understandeth
[1:04:25] he that is who it's been made known to
[1:04:28] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:04:29] my father has drawn him
[1:04:32] all that my father hath given me they
[1:04:34] will come to me my sheep my doves
[1:04:36] hear my voice a stranger they will not
[1:04:38] follow what is the voice of god
[1:04:42] that's a good question so we're going to
[1:04:43] get an answer from the prophet because
[1:04:45] the prophet is the one who told us
[1:04:46] that that god's voice will be in her and
[1:04:49] now he says what is the voice of god
[1:04:51] so if you want to know the voice that
[1:04:53] will be in her the voice of god that
[1:04:54] will be in her
[1:04:55] he's going to answer the question now
[1:04:57] what is the voice of god
[1:04:59] is the word of god the word of god
[1:05:03] is the voice of god the only time that
[1:05:06] the bride is giving the voice of god
[1:05:08] is when she's speaking the word of god
[1:05:10] and i want to tell you this
[1:05:11] it's not a denominational interpretation
[1:05:14] of the word that is the word of god in
[1:05:16] this day
[1:05:17] it's the word with the full revelation
[1:05:19] and the full understanding
[1:05:20] of christ the mystery of god today
[1:05:23] living word amen today
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:26] that is the word what good would it have
[1:05:30] done for paul
[1:05:31] the apostle to go into the synagogue and
[1:05:33] say you know because i don't want to
[1:05:35] offend them and i've got an open door to
[1:05:36] preach here
[1:05:37] i'm not going to cause any offense i'm
[1:05:39] just going to stick with just moses
[1:05:40] because that's the truth
[1:05:44] why did they stone him why did they kick
[1:05:46] him out of the synagogue why was the
[1:05:48] whole city in an uproar amen because he
[1:05:50] wasn't willing just to stick with the
[1:05:51] portion of truth that they would agree
[1:05:53] with
[1:05:53] he had to bring him to present-day truth
[1:05:55] and present-day
[1:05:56] truth was taking all that was in that
[1:05:58] word and bringing it to today
[1:06:00] and saying this is the plan of salvation
[1:06:03] this is
[1:06:04] the water of life that's why they kicked
[1:06:07] him out of the synagogue if he would
[1:06:08] have showed up and just says
[1:06:09] i'm just going to preach on calvary
[1:06:11] today and talk about how the sacrifice
[1:06:13] of jesus christ was such a wonderful
[1:06:14] thing
[1:06:15] they would not have run him out amen
[1:06:17] bringing it to modern terms you see what
[1:06:18] i'm saying if he would have just showed
[1:06:20] up and said i want to talk about how god
[1:06:22] was so good to us in the exodus journey
[1:06:24] and how he took care of us and provided
[1:06:25] for us
[1:06:26] and if paul had just left it there and
[1:06:28] not brought it to the present day exodus
[1:06:30] that was going on they would have never
[1:06:32] kicked him out of the synagogue
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:35] but paul was not there to make them like
[1:06:38] him
[1:06:40] paul was there to say come
[1:06:44] come leave the dog must
[1:06:48] leave the traditions of the fathers and
[1:06:50] come to the truth
[1:06:55] praise god praise god
[1:07:01] what is the voice of god it's the word
[1:07:04] of god
[1:07:05] what is any man's voice but his word
[1:07:08] it's the word of god
[1:07:09] they'll hear the word of god
[1:07:14] in the resume of the ages the prophet
[1:07:17] says i sincerely believe that the spirit
[1:07:19] of god has been speaking to us
[1:07:21] not only teaching us the truths of the
[1:07:23] ages but he has been faithfully dealing
[1:07:25] with hearts
[1:07:26] that they may turn to him that is the
[1:07:28] reason for
[1:07:29] all preaching and teaching for it is in
[1:07:32] the preaching and teaching of the word
[1:07:34] that the sheep hear the voice of god and
[1:07:36] follow him
[1:07:42] again in the resume of the ages with
[1:07:45] this great power
[1:07:46] the church system will persecute the
[1:07:48] true bride
[1:07:50] this image will try to keep the bride
[1:07:52] from preaching and teaching
[1:07:54] why will they try to keep the bride from
[1:07:56] preaching and teaching
[1:08:00] they won't keep churches from teaching
[1:08:02] and preaching
[1:08:04] but they will keep the bride from
[1:08:05] teaching and preaching because her
[1:08:07] teaching and preaching
[1:08:08] is the voice of god it is the voice of
[1:08:12] god
[1:08:14] he said try to keep the bride from
[1:08:16] preaching and teaching
[1:08:17] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[1:08:19] comfort and truth to the people who need
[1:08:20] it
[1:08:21] but before the antichrist in person
[1:08:23] takes over this complete world system of
[1:08:25] churches the true church will be taken
[1:08:27] away from this world
[1:08:28] to be with the lord god will catch away
[1:08:31] his bride for the great married supper
[1:08:32] of the lamb
[1:08:35] but before that time they will try to
[1:08:38] keep the bride from teaching and
[1:08:40] preaching the word
[1:08:42] i tell you she's going to be teaching
[1:08:44] him her teaching and preaching
[1:08:46] is the voice of god and the voice of god
[1:08:48] in this day is saying come
[1:08:51] leave the system leave the lie amen the
[1:08:54] the
[1:08:55] the scale has been taken off the bible
[1:08:57] is open we see the tactics of the devil
[1:08:59] from all the way back in cain
[1:09:01] all the way through amen the bride can
[1:09:03] see the trail of the serpent
[1:09:06] so you can see it from cain and his
[1:09:07] false religion all the way through
[1:09:09] nimrod's false worship
[1:09:10] see it all the way through to the
[1:09:11] pharisees and the sadducees all the way
[1:09:14] through to those who would even come in
[1:09:15] the new testament church and try to
[1:09:17] corrupt the teaching of paul
[1:09:20] all the way through to today that would
[1:09:23] try to corrupt the message
[1:09:26] it's the trail of the serpent and the
[1:09:30] bride can see it because the bride can
[1:09:31] see it she can declare it
[1:09:33] and because she can declare it amen he's
[1:09:35] got to stop that voice
[1:09:39] but god won't let him stop that voice
[1:09:45] listen i'll say it this way
[1:09:48] don't ever quit the message don't ever
[1:09:50] quit declaring it don't ever get
[1:09:52] preaching it
[1:09:52] the hotter it gets and the more intense
[1:09:54] it comes down keep preaching it
[1:09:56] because that's your ticket out of here
[1:10:00] it is your escape clause it is you're a
[1:10:02] ticket to a translation
[1:10:04] it is moving you from this dimension to
[1:10:05] the next because the more they hate the
[1:10:07] message
[1:10:08] and the more they want to stop it
[1:10:09] there's a promise that before they shut
[1:10:11] her up she'll be taken out
[1:10:12] so i say make them want to shut her up
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:18] give them a reason to get into action
[1:10:20] just tell the truth
[1:10:21] say these systems are leading people to
[1:10:23] death amen spiritual
[1:10:25] death spiritual separation from god amen
[1:10:28] they're not leading people to god
[1:10:30] they're not leading people anywhere near
[1:10:31] to god amen the systems the
[1:10:33] denominations the doctrines of men
[1:10:35] are they they're being led by a pale
[1:10:37] horse rider
[1:10:38] leading them to eternal separation from
[1:10:41] god
[1:10:43] and i say proclaim it because that's our
[1:10:45] message come
[1:10:47] leave those things it's death come to
[1:10:50] life
[1:10:52] there's a final struggle going on
[1:10:53] between life and death
[1:10:55] amen and and the word is in the bride
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:00] brother brahm says in christ is the
[1:11:01] mystery of god revealed he said
[1:11:03] identified
[1:11:04] oh the devil is howling about this oh
[1:11:07] pay attention to this friends the devil
[1:11:10] is howling about this the manifested
[1:11:12] truth of the promise of the word in her
[1:11:15] alone
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:19] that doesn't sound nice
[1:11:25] shouldn't it i mean shouldn't we say
[1:11:27] like it could be over there too
[1:11:33] wouldn't it be politically correct and
[1:11:35] nice to say well
[1:11:37] this is what i believe but i'm not
[1:11:40] trying to force it on you i mean
[1:11:42] it's okay for you to believe what you
[1:11:43] believe i believe
[1:11:46] that's the not the message of revelation
[1:11:48] 22 17.
[1:11:50] the message of revelation 22 17 is come
[1:11:52] and that's what the spirit's speaking
[1:11:56] that's what the spirit is not going to
[1:11:58] say anything different
[1:12:00] so if we're saying something different
[1:12:01] then it's not the spirit speaking
[1:12:03] through the bride
[1:12:04] somebody else is speaking another spirit
[1:12:09] this is what the devil is howling about
[1:12:10] the manifested truth of the promise of
[1:12:12] the word
[1:12:13] in her alone
[1:12:18] they don't have the answer when jesus
[1:12:20] come why don't those pharisees
[1:12:21] he said if i cast out devils by the
[1:12:23] finger of god who do you cast them out
[1:12:24] by sea
[1:12:25] he stood alone and his church stands
[1:12:28] alone
[1:12:29] she's not hooked with nothing but he was
[1:12:31] identified by god being the body that
[1:12:33] god dwelled in
[1:12:34] and the church is identified by his body
[1:12:37] doing the same thing
[1:12:38] she is his body the manifested truth of
[1:12:41] his promised word for the last days
[1:12:44] and she and she alone stands by it
[1:12:49] that's why the devil is howling these
[1:12:51] great organizations have set up
[1:12:53] something to close her up
[1:12:54] they'll never do it she'll be taken up
[1:12:56] not closed up
[1:12:57] she is now risen and by the power of the
[1:12:59] vindicated word promised to her
[1:13:02] i'm going to read that last sentence
[1:13:04] because we've heard it so much we might
[1:13:05] miss it
[1:13:08] they're going to set up something to
[1:13:09] close her up we know that
[1:13:11] they'll never do it
[1:13:16] so if threats come they'll never do it
[1:13:22] do you understand
[1:13:26] the threats come that's a good thing
[1:13:29] pressure comes that's a good thing
[1:13:33] because we have a promise instead of
[1:13:36] them in the closer up they'll never do
[1:13:37] it
[1:13:38] shall be taken up not closed up
[1:13:41] praise god now look what he says now
[1:13:44] she is now risen
[1:13:49] will she be taken up yes will it be a
[1:13:51] physical escape yes will there be a
[1:13:52] physical translation
[1:13:53] but she's already taken up friends the
[1:13:56] bride is already resurrected the church
[1:13:58] is already standing on her feet she has
[1:14:00] already risen up
[1:14:01] that's why she can hear what the spirit
[1:14:03] says that's why she can become
[1:14:05] the voice of god that's why she has the
[1:14:07] word to give to be the voice of the god
[1:14:09] that's why she knows what her message is
[1:14:11] and the messages come
[1:14:12] because she's already risen up this
[1:14:14] church is back
[1:14:17] the church that fell the bride that he
[1:14:19] wanted to marry the bride he wanted to
[1:14:20] be united to to fulfill his purpose that
[1:14:22] he showed in eden
[1:14:23] that bride is back friends
[1:14:28] and that's what the devil's howling
[1:14:29] about because she knows who she is she
[1:14:30] knows what she stands for she knows who
[1:14:32] the antichrist is and she knows what
[1:14:34] he's trying to do
[1:14:35] and she's willing to say it
[1:14:40] she is now risen and by the power of the
[1:14:43] vindicated word
[1:14:44] promised to her we've been raised by the
[1:14:47] word
[1:14:49] it's lifted us into heavenly places for
[1:14:52] us friends the heavens have been open
[1:14:54] for us there's been a door open there's
[1:14:55] been a spiritual climb that has taken
[1:14:57] place
[1:14:58] just like for john john was in the
[1:15:00] spirit and he's seen
[1:15:01] the seventh seal and we've been lifted
[1:15:04] up and seen the same thing amen and the
[1:15:06] heavens have been opened and we've seen
[1:15:08] the word coming in power and
[1:15:09] manifestation and all heaven here to
[1:15:11] back it up
[1:15:12] we've seen it friends it's a reality to
[1:15:14] us
[1:15:15] the heaven is open the heaven is no
[1:15:17] longer close to us like it was through
[1:15:19] the church ages
[1:15:20] but after the church ages when the word
[1:15:22] has come the heaven is now open to us
[1:15:24] friends and all of heaven backs us up
[1:15:28] why because heaven consists of the word
[1:15:30] and all the word
[1:15:31] has come
[1:15:35] i could use a little backup you've got
[1:15:36] the back up it's here
[1:15:39] the whole word is here
[1:15:42] praise god i love it
[1:15:51] oh praise god i take too long
[1:15:55] let's go to ephesians chapter six
[1:15:59] i always shorten my notes get them
[1:16:01] whittled down think that would be quick
[1:16:02] we won't take very long
[1:16:05] god forgive me

[1:16:24] is a battle this is a fight this is the
[1:16:26] last struggle so we've got to put on the
[1:16:28] whole armor of god that's why paul is
[1:16:30] speaking this way
[1:16:31] because this is a fight the apostle paul
[1:16:34] is writing this brother ben and brought
[1:16:35] us back to this
[1:16:36] because this is warfare spiritual
[1:16:39] warfare
[1:16:40] amen and the trumpet has been blown that
[1:16:42] last
[1:16:43] seventh trumpet that contains all seven
[1:16:45] previous trumpets and the gospel trumpet
[1:16:47] has been
[1:16:48] sounded declaring spiritual war the
[1:16:50] final of the battles for the gentile age
[1:16:54] and so this is war put on the armor of
[1:16:57] god that you may be able to stand
[1:16:58] against the wiles of the devil
[1:17:00] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:17:01] blood but against principalities against
[1:17:04] powers against the rulers of the
[1:17:05] darkness of this world
[1:17:06] against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
[1:17:10] places
[1:17:11] i know it says high places but almost
[1:17:14] everywhere else that's used in the bible
[1:17:16] the same greek word
[1:17:17] is interpreted heavenly place translated
[1:17:19] heavenly places
[1:17:20] or heavenlies so where are we fighting
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:24] if you don't have a vision of the of the
[1:17:27] heavens open you don't realize where the
[1:17:29] battle is
[1:17:30] amen we are on earth but we are fighting
[1:17:32] a heavenly battle
[1:17:35] we are fighting powers in the heavenlies
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:38] powers in the heavens
[1:17:42] let's keep reading wherefore take unto
[1:17:45] you the whole armor of god that you may
[1:17:46] be able to withstand in the evil day
[1:17:49] i say this is the evil day and having
[1:17:51] done all
[1:17:52] to stand stand therefore having your
[1:17:54] loins gird about with truth
[1:17:56] have we been given the truth amen cover
[1:17:59] yourself with the truth amen
[1:18:01] and having on the breastplate of
[1:18:02] righteousness what righteousness imputed
[1:18:04] righteousness why because we have the
[1:18:06] faith of abraham
[1:18:08] and our heart is covered by that faith
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:18:14] of the gospel of peace
[1:18:17] oh this is so interesting your feet shod
[1:18:20] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:18:21] peace
[1:18:22] amen this is war what are we talking
[1:18:24] about peace
[1:18:26] we've got armor we're going to fight a
[1:18:28] battle we've got a shield
[1:18:30] we've got our loins gert with truth
[1:18:32] we've got a breastplate of righteousness
[1:18:34] we're going to find we have a helmet of
[1:18:35] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:18:37] what in the world are we doing with
[1:18:38] these shoes of peace
[1:18:42] because friends the only way to peace
[1:18:45] is to march forward amen you've got to
[1:18:48] have shoes to continue this journey
[1:18:50] because we can't stop and have peace we
[1:18:52] can't go back in half peace
[1:18:54] the only way to have peace is when the
[1:18:56] god of all peace shall brew satan under
[1:18:58] your
[1:18:58] feet shod with peace amen
[1:19:02] the only way there will be peace is when
[1:19:04] antichrist is slain
[1:19:06] by the word we'll have peace and the
[1:19:08] only way we'll have this
[1:19:09] is if this army continues to advance in
[1:19:11] the kingdom of god
[1:19:13] and move up in the revelation of god and
[1:19:15] move forward in the word of god
[1:19:17] that's why it's so detrimental amen so
[1:19:19] many times
[1:19:20] we think if i just let down on the word
[1:19:23] i'll have peace
[1:19:24] because the more we push the word the
[1:19:26] more we advance in the word and declare
[1:19:28] the truth by revelation
[1:19:29] the more pushback we get
[1:19:32] and it's easy to think if i want to have
[1:19:34] peace if i had less trouble and less
[1:19:36] criticism and less
[1:19:38] conflict amen if i just if i just pause
[1:19:41] for a minute i'll have peace
[1:19:43] i tell your friends you'll never have
[1:19:45] peace the only time we'll ever have
[1:19:47] peace
[1:19:47] is when our enemy is completely
[1:19:49] destroyed and he's not going to be
[1:19:50] completely destroyed until this bride
[1:19:52] has finished her mission on this earth
[1:19:56] so we have to have the shoes of peace
[1:19:59] moving us towards peace
[1:20:05] and above all take the shield of faith
[1:20:07] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:20:09] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:20:11] and take the helmet of salvation protect
[1:20:14] our minds
[1:20:16] with the revelation of our salvation
[1:20:20] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:20:22] word of god
[1:20:25] praying always with all prayer and
[1:20:27] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:20:28] there unto
[1:20:29] all perseverance and supplication for
[1:20:32] all saints
[1:20:34] if you notice in the armor we have armor
[1:20:37] with shoes covering we only have one
[1:20:41] weapon
[1:20:42] and that weapon is the sword of the
[1:20:44] spirit which is the word of god
[1:20:46] and it happens to be the same thing that
[1:20:48] was sticking out of the mouth of the
[1:20:49] white horse rider
[1:20:51] it was the word of god and the same
[1:20:55] thing that was in his mouth
[1:20:57] came into brother banham's in sabino
[1:21:00] canyon
[1:21:01] in his hand something hit his hand and
[1:21:03] he saw a sword it fit his hand just
[1:21:05] perfect
[1:21:07] he said he heard a voice see that's the
[1:21:09] king's sword he said oh a king sword
[1:21:11] they knight a king maybe he said no
[1:21:14] the king's sword which king is that
[1:21:18] king of kings and lord of lords the one
[1:21:21] on the white horse amen
[1:21:23] the the sword that was coming out of his
[1:21:24] mouth was put into the hand of a prophet
[1:21:26] amen and that prophet had that word in
[1:21:28] the hand
[1:21:29] and he took that word and he gave it to
[1:21:31] the bride and the bride has the sword
[1:21:33] of the spirit which is the word of god
[1:21:38] not a different sword not a lesser sword
[1:21:40] it's the same sword it's the word of god
[1:21:42] friends
[1:21:46] amen what weapon do you have
[1:21:50] forget reasoning forget effort forget
[1:21:53] trying
[1:21:54] forget all of those things the only
[1:21:55] victory we'll ever have in pushing back
[1:21:57] the enemy is if we take the word and the
[1:21:59] hand of faith
[1:22:00] and we take the feet shod with the
[1:22:02] preparation of the gospel and move
[1:22:03] forward with the sword we've got to keep
[1:22:07] moving with this word we've got to keep
[1:22:09] advancing on any antichrist spirit that
[1:22:11] comes against this word
[1:22:12] we can't slow down we can't back down we
[1:22:14] cannot stop
[1:22:15] we've got to march forward with the
[1:22:17] sword in our hand
[1:22:19] in the first seal brother man says
[1:22:21] christ has a sharp sword and watch
[1:22:23] it comes from his mouth the living word
[1:22:26] that's the word of god revealed to his

[1:23:03] the bride
[1:23:04] in the last day and the quickening power
[1:23:08] has got to come
[1:23:08] quicken them out of these dead
[1:23:10] denominations and creeds to a living
[1:23:12] word
[1:23:13] of the living god
[1:23:17] brother brown says in the breach talk
[1:23:20] about a jubilee talk about a time when

[1:23:38] the foundation of the world
[1:23:39] and he took the book open the book and

[1:24:12] and who is our enemy in this day
[1:24:14] anything that's against the word is our
[1:24:15] enemy and anything that's against the
[1:24:17] word is antichrist and the only way to
[1:24:19] defeat the antichrist is with the sword
[1:24:21] that was coming out of his
[1:24:22] mouth in revelation 19 and that was put
[1:24:25] in the hand of a prophet and it was
[1:24:26] given down to us

[1:24:34] guaranteed victory if we'll hold on to
[1:24:36] it and keep moving forward

[1:27:25] chance of you not making it because the
[1:27:27] seals have opened the mystery of your
[1:27:29] life
[1:27:29] and you see yourself on the other side
[1:27:31] amen there's a shout going on in heaven
[1:27:33] right now
[1:27:34] and heaven hears it now and everything
[1:27:37] under heaven
[1:27:38] under the earth hears it now that's what
[1:27:40] the war is about
[1:27:41] hell is on the earth heavens on the
[1:27:43] earth and they're fighting over this
[1:27:45] revelation of the
[1:27:46] truth in her alone
[1:27:52] it is the threat to the devil's kingdom
[1:27:55] it is the thing that will bring him
[1:27:56] complete destruction
[1:28:01] john must have looked and seen past the
[1:28:03] current time and said there's
[1:28:04] john oh he was so happy
[1:28:08] said everything in heaven he must have
[1:28:10] really cried out didn't he everything in
[1:28:12] heaven
[1:28:12] everything in the earth everything
[1:28:14] beneath the earth every creature and
[1:28:15] everything else heard me saying amen
[1:28:17] blessing and glory and wisdom and power
[1:28:19] and might and riches belongs to him
[1:28:22] why when the revelation come that the
[1:28:24] lamb
[1:28:25] the redeemer our kinsmen had come back
[1:28:28] from the throne of mediatorial
[1:28:29] and had walked out here to take his
[1:28:31] possession
[1:28:33] what caused all the shouting what caused
[1:28:35] when he realized
[1:28:36] that he's already redeemed when you
[1:28:39] realize that the kingdom redeemer
[1:28:41] has come he's done with the mediatorial
[1:28:43] work he's done the work of redemption
[1:28:45] now he's come to claim his possession
[1:28:50] and when he comes to claim his
[1:28:51] possession amen the possession
[1:28:53] realized is that they're the possession
[1:28:56] it's no longer a mystery
[1:28:57] am i this or am i that or which
[1:28:59] doctrine's right or how do i be right or
[1:29:01] do i do hail mary's do i live a right
[1:29:03] life
[1:29:04] do i believe what luther preached how or
[1:29:06] do i know that i'm his possession am i
[1:29:08] the redeemed
[1:29:08] it was a mystery through the church ages
[1:29:12] but in the end time john realized when
[1:29:15] he saw the lamb come and take the book
[1:29:17] he realized he was the possession amen
[1:29:20] because after the church he's there he's
[1:29:22] there redeeming through the church
[1:29:24] agency they're mediating to the church
[1:29:26] ages
[1:29:26] but when he's done mediating for the
[1:29:28] church age believers now when it comes
[1:29:30] time
[1:29:30] amen to move into his possession in the
[1:29:32] bright age he can come forward from the
[1:29:34] work of mediation and he can come and
[1:29:36] take the book and lose the seals
[1:29:38] and come down and possess his possession
[1:29:42] and that's what's happening right now
[1:29:45] friends amen that's why brother brahm
[1:29:46] said there they know he was a redeemer
[1:29:48] on earth and they're hollering
[1:29:49] because they don't know who he is they
[1:29:51] don't know where he is
[1:29:53] all they know is a past manifestation
[1:29:55] they don't know where he is today
[1:29:57] he is currently possessing his bride
[1:30:00] he is claiming his possession he is here
[1:30:03] in his bride
[1:30:04] the son must be manifest again in his
[1:30:07] bride
[1:30:09] the same jesus christ in bright form
[1:30:11] jesus christ in the formation of the
[1:30:13] bride
[1:30:17] and the spirit and the bride they come
[1:30:24] hebrews 4 12 says for the word of god is
[1:30:27] quick
[1:30:29] and powerful what word the same one that
[1:30:31] came out of his mouth
[1:30:34] the same one that he's put in your hand
[1:30:38] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:30:42] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:30:44] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:30:47] of soul and spirit
[1:30:51] what does that mean it means he can
[1:30:54] separate you from you
[1:30:57] so you can know who you really are
[1:31:01] amen in this life you've been so close
[1:31:03] to that earthly spirit
[1:31:05] so bound in the tabernacle of fallen
[1:31:08] flesh of hybrid flesh
[1:31:09] so tight amen there's nothing that can
[1:31:12] separate
[1:31:13] the earthly carnal spirit from the soul
[1:31:16] but
[1:31:16] this word that's coming out of his mouth
[1:31:18] and it's coming this last day
[1:31:20] when the right horse rider has come down
[1:31:22] amen and he and he gave that sword that
[1:31:24] word to the
[1:31:25] to the to the prophet and the prophet
[1:31:27] gave it to the bride and now the bride
[1:31:29] has the word amen that will cut between
[1:31:32] the bone and the moral that'll
[1:31:34] cut between the soul and the spirit so
[1:31:37] that you can properly identify who you
[1:31:39] are
[1:31:39] and you can say what a great day that
[1:31:42] was when i realized i was not the son of
[1:31:44] charles and ella branham
[1:31:46] what did that it was the sword of the
[1:31:48] spirit that had come in this end time
[1:31:50] mother branham didn't say that till
[1:31:51] after the seals
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:55] and when they see the seals open when
[1:31:57] you see the redeemer come
[1:31:58] when you've got the sword that come out
[1:32:00] of the white horse rider's mouth
[1:32:02] it'll cut you to the separation of the
[1:32:05] spirit
[1:32:05] and the soul and you can see what john
[1:32:08] saw
[1:32:08] you can say i'm not the son of my mom
[1:32:11] and dad
[1:32:12] i'm not just an earthly vessel i'm not
[1:32:14] the product of a physical union but i
[1:32:17] was there before
[1:32:18] and i'm over there now
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:21] amen that's what this word does friends
[1:32:25] and that's why when we compromise on
[1:32:26] this word we're keeping people from
[1:32:28] finding their identification
[1:32:30] because it's this revelation under the
[1:32:32] seals that give people the ability to
[1:32:34] cut between the spirit
[1:32:36] of man and the soul that comes from god
[1:32:42] this is the only message that will do it
[1:32:45] this is the only revelation this is the
[1:32:47] only sword
[1:32:48] of this revealed word in this day that
[1:32:51] will separate
[1:32:52] the spirit from the soul
[1:32:56] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:33:00] where is that white horse rider he's
[1:33:01] writing his church
[1:33:04] in the resurrection that the prophet of
[1:33:06] god said this is the resurrection
[1:33:08] that the church has now risen that the
[1:33:10] church is standing on her feet that the
[1:33:11] church is back
[1:33:12] where is the right horse rider he's
[1:33:13] riding his church in the resurrection
[1:33:15] all the way to glory
[1:33:18] who is the white horse rider it's the
[1:33:20] holy spirit
[1:33:21] when did the holy spirit come back in
[1:33:23] the church at the at the end time
[1:33:25] message the loosing of the seals
[1:33:26] and the end time message is there any
[1:33:30] is there any doubt where he is is there
[1:33:33] any doubt where the white horse rider is
[1:33:35] is there any doubt where the word is
[1:33:40] brother bennett says in the pergameon
[1:33:42] church age
[1:33:44] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:33:46] son
[1:33:48] jesus never did anything until he was
[1:33:49] first shown him by the father
[1:33:51] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:33:53] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:33:55] word of life
[1:33:56] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:33:58] therefore nothing can harm her
[1:34:00] not even death for the seed be planted
[1:34:02] the water will raise it up again
[1:34:04] here is the secret of this the word
[1:34:08] is in the bride
[1:34:11] where is the sword in the bride where is
[1:34:14] the white horse rider christ
[1:34:16] he's riding his church in the
[1:34:17] resurrection where is the holy ghost the
[1:34:19] life
[1:34:20] it's here the fourth messenger of life
[1:34:22] is here the white horse rider is here
[1:34:24] the armies of heaven are here
[1:34:28] this last great battle between the
[1:34:31] antichrist and christ
[1:34:32] is going on here the last great struggle
[1:34:34] between
[1:34:35] death and life is here
[1:34:39] it's going on here friends
[1:34:43] there is nothing else to preach
[1:34:50] there is nothing else to preach
[1:34:53] there is nothing else that will help
[1:34:57] but this word of life
[1:35:01] because it doesn't matter how much
[1:35:04] we can preach a message that makes the
[1:35:06] flesh feel good
[1:35:08] it doesn't matter how much you can
[1:35:10] preach a message that will comfort the
[1:35:11] spirit
[1:35:13] if you don't have the sword that can cut
[1:35:15] between the spirit and the soul
[1:35:17] there is no deliverance for anybody
[1:35:22] there is no deliverance in the social
[1:35:24] gospel there is no deliverance in a
[1:35:26] historical gospel there is only
[1:35:27] deliverance in the sword that has been
[1:35:29] placed in our hands in this day
[1:35:31] and that sword can separate because why
[1:35:34] because it can peel
[1:35:34] off the mystery of christ and you can
[1:35:36] find out i've been part of christ
[1:35:38] all along i was in the logos that came
[1:35:40] out of god amen
[1:35:42] i'm an attribute of god a child of god
[1:35:44] always been part of god
[1:35:45] always will be part of god where did i
[1:35:47] find that out i found it under the seals
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:50] i found it under the seventh church age
[1:35:52] messenger when he revealed the mystery
[1:35:54] of god
[1:35:54] and the mystery of god was christ and
[1:35:56] i'm part of christ
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:35:59] in being part of christ i'm part of the
[1:36:01] revelation of the mystery of god
[1:36:03] when god wanted to become tangible god
[1:36:05] wanted to be manifest in his attributes
[1:36:07] god wanted fellowship with his
[1:36:09] attributes i was there in god then i was
[1:36:11] one of those attributes
[1:36:12] and now he saw to it to bring me out in
[1:36:14] this time and bring me through this
[1:36:16] faith
[1:36:16] so that he can unite back with me
[1:36:20] there's nothing else to preach there's
[1:36:22] nothing else to talk about there's
[1:36:24] nothing else to live for
[1:36:30] praise be to god i say preach it
[1:36:34] preach it until they want to shut us up
[1:36:40] because they'll never do it
[1:36:43] preach it until the whole system gathers
[1:36:47] because when they're just about to
[1:36:50] accomplish
[1:36:56] friends it's not about being
[1:36:57] antagonistic it's not about being
[1:37:00] it's not about fighting it's about
[1:37:02] bringing deliverance to people the only
[1:37:04] way to bring deliverance
[1:37:06] there's no other message in this day
[1:37:08] there's no other plan for salvation in
[1:37:10] this day there's no other ark of safety
[1:37:12] in this day
[1:37:13] the only place to be is in christ and
[1:37:14] christ is this revelation of this word
[1:37:17] the only place to say come to is to this
[1:37:20] fountain of life
[1:37:22] it's not antagonistic it's not
[1:37:25] argumentative
[1:37:26] it's the truth and it's the only truth
[1:37:30] and it's the only way to connect with
[1:37:32] god and it's the only
[1:37:34] way to unlock eternal life and it's the
[1:37:36] only way to see beyond the curtain of
[1:37:38] time
[1:37:40] the heavens have been opened there's
[1:37:43] nothing else to preach
[1:37:45] god is good the spirit
[1:37:49] and the bride say come
[1:37:53] come to this truth come to this fountain
[1:37:57] come to this manifested word

[1:38:37] never be defeated i'll never be cast
[1:38:39] down
[1:38:40] i'll never be deceived i'll never be
[1:38:42] separated from the love of god why
[1:38:44] because the seals revealed who i really
[1:38:46] was because the sword of the white horse
[1:38:48] rider
[1:38:48] that word that's coming out the living
[1:38:50] word coming out of his mouth that's been
[1:38:51] given to the servant
[1:38:52] has come and separated the spirit from
[1:38:54] the soul in me
[1:38:57] and i can see who i really am
