third part of our tape service here on there is a man that can hear that can turn on the light we've been listening to this over the last previous two Wednesdays this is the third Wednesday and we should be able to finish the tape tonight that's the plan I want to go through our book here I hope everybody still has their book or their tablet or their phone or whatever they're going through we're going to get into this third part we'll go into the questions in just a minute I want to do a quick just a real quick review of some of the questions we've had the last two times then we'll go through the questions for tonight and then we'll read our opening scriptures and get right into the tape uh the first question that we asked two weeks ago was What is the subject that brother Brandon was going into and is going to speak on and he said his subject was light so his title is there's a man here that can turn on the light but his subject is light and then we asked also the question what how does light come and he said by the spoken word of God so how does light come by the spoken word of God and then another question was life comes by what by the word of God manifested or made flesh so we've we've got all of these things that he's been teaching us through this message then last Wednesday we had a couple more questions I'm not going through all of them I'm just pulling out a couple just to refresh us where we've been as we move on we ask the question what guides you to the light and the answer is the word the word is what guides us to the light and that's going to be important tonight and something brother Venom gets into and also something we'll review at the end is what guides you to the light is the word and we are so thankful that we live in a day where we all have a Bible we have it interpreted in our language we all have free access to it amen in in the word of God is our guide that guides us to the light amen and um and and we'll talk about that more a little bit later but it's it's we're so thankful too that the messages have come and taken the veil off of the word to give us the correct interpretation of the word and so now we're not dependent on this one says this and this one says that but God has brought back the correct interpretation of his word so we're not pulled to and fro but we come back to the message of the hour which is restored us back to our Bibles with the correct interpretation of the Bible and it guides us to the light that is so important that we we always keep that foundational truth intact another question was why did they reject the Messiah and the answer was they were living in the glare of another age because of their Traditions so why did they reject the Messiah because they were living in the glare of a previous age by their Traditions why did they reject the Messiah Christ in our day for the exact same reasons amen another question was we cannot live by what kind of light and the prophet said yesterday's light we cannot live by yesterday's life yesterday's light brought yesterday's life but we must live by today's light and he also went on to say you cannot live by yesterday's manna that got wiggle tails in it and it rotted you have to have the fresh Manna for the day you're living in to live by amen praise God so I'd like to go into the questions for tonight all right question number one how do we bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ how do we bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ this is when it would have been nice to learn shorthand question number two what caused the greatest robbery the Church of God had foreign what caused the greatest robbery the Church of God had question number three how does the church remit sin how does the church remit sins this is a good one in number four who is the chief mechanic probably know the answer but I want to see it in context who's the chief mechanic I'll give you a little clue he's also the man that can turn on the light and we're finally going to get to that part in part three but the brand hasn't touched on that yet but we'll get to that tonight who is the chief mechanic and number five how does he turn on the light so we know there's a man who can turn on the light but the question is how does he turn on the light and that's a good question all right if you're done writing the questions let's just stand and read our scriptures so we stay familiar with the scriptures brother Benham used in the beginning we're going to turn to Isaiah 42 and in Isaiah 42 we're going to begin reading from verse 1. so Isaiah 42 Isaiah 42 and 1. behold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break in a smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the Isle shall wait for his long thus saith God the Lord he he that created the heavens and stressed him out he that spreadeth forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house now I want to re we're reviewing back to Brothers opening scripture but now we're two-thirds of the way almost into this message and we realize he's talking about people coming out of denominational darkness and Delight now look at what Christ is to do he's for a lighter to the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house so now we realize how bad the denominational system is in the light of the scripture it's a prison house that's barred people from Christ so it's I think it's always good to remember the scriptures brother Branham sets as the as this context because then as he goes into preaching you realize he's taking it from this and now we realize how much the Gentiles need light and that our eyes were blind and we were in prison let's go to Matthew chapter 4 which is the second scripture that brother Brenham read Matthew chapter 4. and verse 12. Matthew chapter 4 and begin reading at verse 12. now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelton Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and the borders of Zebulon and naphthalam that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah's the prophet saying the land of Zebulon in the land of nathalum by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light has sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so after the ministry of John the Baptist which was an Elijah Ministry Jesus moved into the land of the Gentiles and it said a great light has sprung up to those that sit in darkness to those that's the people that sit in darkness saw great light and to them it sit in the region in the shadows of death light is sprung up and Jesus began to preach saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven as at hand now do you see where we're at there was a man here who can turn on the light amen you can take your seats if you'd like to take your books or whatever you'll be reading along in we're going to begin at the top of page 33 in our books if you have the book and the top of page 33 which is the beginning of paragraph 179 so if you're using a tablet or a phone it would be the beginning of paragraph 179 and we're going to go all the way to the end and and you know don't forget you have the freedom to say Amen to the word amen this is the preaching of the word and also at the end we're going to be all the way through the closing out of the service where brother random spraying and singing and feel free to sing along amen I enjoy it when we all sing along with the table so God bless you brother Frank if we can begin yesterday it's oh my how we are to see that see that the rotten things of yesterday don't eat them today it's got worms in it you know these little wiggle Tails I call them I don't know I I don't know much about germi but I know we always call them wiggle tails it gets in anything but it gets a little rotten see I don't want it then if you're satisfied with it go ahead but not me but remember you say then why was it good yesterday if you only knew that the very little Hull that was on the wheat at the beginning if it abides in the green it makes the grain further that's the very thing that makes a wheat flour yeah is what was yesterday but if it separates itself from the green it don't mature then it goes away but if it goes through the process of life-giving process as it dies out it just Blends into something else and makes a grain amen if it isn't where does it come from amen amen amen like the Queen of England once she went to a great paper company and she said she would like to see through the paper of Mills so they showed her the paper mills many years ago and before they went to making it to both the stuff so they find they're making papers out of it so they Roger while she come into a room that was nothing but a big old pile of dirty rags and she said where did this come from what's this oh she said the the president of the plane said this is uh is what uh we'll make the paper out of these dirty Ray she said that make paper yes so she couldn't hardly believe it so actually she was gone the man took the same dirty pile of eggs and running through a certain process and brought him out with clean pure paper you know have been went through a process and made real and put her profile in it and santera reflected herself in this what she called dirty rags now that's what it is the dead things of yestery the message of Luther the message of Wesley the message of Pentecost if it can only go through the process of God's holy spirit in the word of the Vindication yes it'll bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ but if you leave it lay it's dirty Rays it's got to be molded into something else Luther has got to be molded into West and Western's got to be molded into Pentecost and Pentecost it's got to be molded into Christ it goes through a process so has the gospel gone through a process is processing Luther's age of justification we believe that amenities of sanctification we believe that the Pentecostals of the restoration of the gifts of the Holy Ghost we believe that certainly but mold it all together what do you come out with Jesus the same yesterday today and forever Jesus when a man of founder is making a bell he's got a certain tone he has to putt in it when he's setting his mold and pouring his iron he puts in so much brass so much steel so much copper why he knows just exactly how much to put in but to make you at the right tone and that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had to put so much Luther so much Methodist and so much Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it oh what does it come out with his own reflection why is it it's like a pyramid message you see it's heaping out of this coming to the minority for The Headstone the ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth has to be the same as a Ministry yet or he can't come to it Pete's not the head but the head packs the feet they're in Mexico where to go you get it beautifully it's the light of the hour Wesley was a great light like he said to John the Baptist it was a great life for his hour yeah sure he was no yes sir they're clean Rags or the dirty rags of yesterday if you remain that way it's got the Elias become dirty rides all the time it served his purpose as clothing but nice to become paper justification service time and justification under Luther then it had to become sanctification to Wesley and save the cases served it's time to become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism the Holy Ghost to serve his time until the Holy Spirit which is the only one God Blends into the Church of the church and the Christ that makes Jesus Christ reflected on the Earth but he promised you in the Bible why not believe it I can't make you do that I'm only responsible for the word amen that's right so you see it do you see that if you do it'll be like the the man one time went to do it went over to Wales during the time of the Welsh Revival a bunch of men with the United States so he goes down and they said they want to find out what building they was holding this Welsh regard but many of you remember the Welsh Revival great Revival broke out amongst the Welsh people and well so these men and these great big ministers and so forth went from the United States say doctors of divinity they want to go over to see what great thing they've done you know it's always walking down the street they said met a little old policeman standard O'Connor whoreless Club around you know and whistling uh him like that and said well he's just Switzerland to him we might go see him see what he's going to do well asked him a question so they went up to him and said sir Where is the Welsh Revival ad he tipped off his head he said sirs the Welsh Revival was held in here oh that's it he was a well oh God if we could only only son or say that we are the reflection of Jesus Christ where is the Welsh Revival held what building is it and he said sir it's in my heart that's right and today the church ought to be Jesus Christ yes and action upon the Earth because I live you live also and my life will be in you the works that I do you'll do also see the church has got to get to that pace to and he promised he would do it and it will just got to come that way so you see that's what takes place we we got to be that way he's alive so was Noah the light in his day he was alive nor was that line he was a light to what to make God's word I will destroy a man upon the Earth that I've created build an ark and all desires to come into it will be saved nor will tell there said he's one way and that's the art they said the old crazy fanatic he was the word made manifest Noah was a lot of the hour sure what his day his age he sprung forth to life Moses was a lot of his hour I'll surely visit you God said to Abraham now come down and I'll take out of but people with a strong hand I'll show my power in Egypt and when Moses up there met that Bernie Bush up there and found out the I am was in that Bush Moses went down there and he was the light amen no wonder he could take some dust and blow it up say Let There come fleas upon the Earth he had the word of God what happened the dust began to blow on the fleas began to come into existence he was a manifestation of the light of God's word he was a prophet what he said come to pass he was a light of that day he was God's life Pharaoh might have had everything he wanted to have the rest of and all the priests had what they wanted but Moses was the life why he was showing forth God's word manifesting God promised I'll bring him out under a strong hand and I'll get myself Glory that's what he was doing amen that's reason Moses proved that he could create not because he wanted to create because God told him amen God go to the congregation tomorrow the Lord God has just spoke to me take a handful of dust and throw it up in the sky I guess in the call for it there's none here but he'll be there amen all right oh I hope you're not asleep he said I'm sent God did say to our fathers surely he'd visit us down here take us out I've come to prove you that scars someone said well I believe Nathan said I don't think he's in any hurry we shouldn't be all excited about this and looked like it failed four or five times but just the same it moved off amen they thought that God said we stoned this Moses get him away from us we don't want him in our our group here what was this group not on anyhow because he was alive yeah he was alive while he had what was it God manifesting his promised word through Moses and Moses was the light Elijah was alive there sit on that Hill off command the Ravens to feed you amen yes sir you come back down with the saith the Lord not even dual fall from Heaven till I call foreign take care of him and everything they thought he was crazy but he's he was alive they say hey when I become that a Holy Roller Head around here you know what somebody was hunting it inside they see him setting up there way up on top of that mountain there I bet that old fella is about dried up at this time no no he was alive he was alive his day John when he came to the Earth went out in the wilderness to get his education from God not the Seminary he had to introduce the Messiah so when he come forth Jesus said he was a bright and shiny light yeah Hallelujah he was a word Manifesto Isaiah said so yeah that's it that's right it sent forth a voice in the wilderness crying saying prepare the way for the Lord and make straight his gate make straight away he'd cry one voice of one crying in the wilderness here he come forth what was he boys one crying in the wilderness what was he manifestation of the word light amen saying God the spoken Genesis and spoke this and here come the lie as he said let there be light for the sun the sun come in existence today so there will be a voice of one crying in the water should have come forth it was a light of the hour he also said in the last days [Applause] flee from the Wrath it is to come John said the same thing that actually laid to the root of the tree didn't even have an education didn't talk like even a preacher he talked about serpents and sticks and trees and axes and things what he's used to in the wilderness he wasn't raised up some of this great big fine stuff they have today in that day he'd come out with his own language he didn't stand say oh man and make all these fancy vows and come right out of the Wilderness don't you begin to think about that God disable these storms don't you think because your Methodist Baptist Presbyterians you have any hold on God God's able to take Bootleggers somebody's going to hear somebody's going to believe it he said almost is laid to the root of the tree every tree that don't believe it's You Down cast Into the Fire so that was his message he was alive today Jesus said he was a bright and Shining Light and you for a little while desired to walk into it and why did John say the prophet he's standing among you right now yeah I'm not worthy to lose his shoes and as soon as he comes on the scene I'm going off oh amen there's no two or three life so four or five different organizations it was one life that's not nothing is Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian Christ is and the word manifested is a light of the hour let there be light and there was life yes sir let there be light and there is light he spoke there would be light and this day and there is life he's coming I believe him amen look at the promises of this age oh man every light that's ever shine these Church ages we see how they it's been a pitfall sight you see rejected Revelation 3 I have wrote down here Revelation 3 and I know what I was referring to then look to the promise of this hour what we're living in a rejected light but they they rejected it back there what is living in a glare what are they doing today same thing yes well are you a Christian well I'm a loser I'm a Baptist I'm Presbyterian that don't mean one thing amen because I see you as the hog pig or anything else that's about how much it means no no disregards to you but if you're taking it to this fundamental part that's right yeah I asked the question a Christian that's Christ in you and if Christ is in you then the word is in you is that the word is in you when the light's shining and how are you going to walk out of it yeah that's the question that's what's in now the light the evening lights are shining the bride tree is blue oh remember they prune that old tree and what the canker worm left the Palm where I'm eating what the Palm worm left the caterpillar eating what the Methodist left the Baptist eating what the Badness left the Pentecostal eating he said this tree is a joy that was cut all down to his thumb but he won't know if it would live again oh yeah he reserved that tree yes sir apart was his bride and he said I will restore saith the Lord what is it I'll bring it forth all that the Lutheran eating the Westland eating and all them and I will restore it causes all still in the root of the tree see just laying down on the ground just like the sap that went out as he said about the sister it's laying there and the trumpet of God shall sound someday in them elected Lutheran Methodist Baptists that had nothing to do with any organization [Music] Moody never organized nothing it was that grouper Ricky's address John Smith organized nothing none of the rest of them organized it was the light of the hour Luther Wesley and other rest of them it was that group actors come by that made the organization yeah uh the Holy Ghost never organized nothing in Pentecost Pentecost is an experience not a denomination amen they never organized nothing oh no but the man who claimed to be Pentecost to organize it that's the husk and her dying instead of pressing into the paper to make the full image of Jesus Christ come forth no they pulled themselves out so there's nothing to do into it hey just let him alone but we find out this light this tree Christ rejected Again by the church why for the same cause that he did first this old false glares of Lights of other days and he's the same yesterday today and forever in Hebrews 13 8 says is and the same the day as he was in because he does the same thing that he did the same word that Christ listen is taking out let this be personal honorable I'm a little decide where turn it off now or not see for that tape I'll just let it stay there amen watch this hey man he is the same yesterday and forever watch his works that he did manifest itself now listen close when he stood there in John 14 12 he said The Works that I do shall you do also greater than this shall you do for I go unto my father now he said it heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never fail now if we're at the last end of the age where is them Greater Works go together all right we're here we haven't got listen if the Roman Calendar is right we got six we got 36 years left every 2000 years the world meets your end first two thousand years were destroyed by water second two thousand years Christ come this is 19 and 64 coming up 36 years now the Egyptian astronomy calendar says we're 17 years out it's 17 years Advanced from that that would leave 19 years later Jesus said the work will be cut short for the elected sake of being open to save where are we at the works that I do shall you also same kind but greater now watch listen folks get on here I pray that God will open your heart and your mind understanding so what you'll understand without saying it's too much here notice he said one day let's see some of the great work he done let's just stop for just a couple things let's think one time he said uh you feed him something to eat they said we have nothing so what have you got bring me what you've got and they said we have uh five barley Loaves and two fishes he said bring them to me and he took the original five barley laws and began to break the laws and from the original He Made bread it fed five thousand is that right that he said he got a fish hand me the fish it was a fish to begin with and he took off that fish and other fish and another fish and fed five dollars is that right but in the last days he had nothing it has to be fulfilled yeah I could tell you things that would shake you see it's there when he says it's there hey let him say it see just as I could see the East the Wester has come back and met the East it was Moses even picked up sand and said let there be fleas and so forth like that upon the Earth but in this last day he doesn't take anything see just the word on me yeah I want to testify of some of those things tonight amen but what's happened but you can see he's still God his words cannot these works that I do shall you also a greater than this shall you do I tuck a fish to make a fish you don't even have to have a fish he's still God is still the same son the same Son of God that took a fish off of a fish it's the same Son of God today these these works that I do shall you also even greater than this will you do it'll be magnified greater than this shall you do and people refuse to sit Greater Works a false lighter you know what I was just thinking of something I was referred a lot about England but I was thinking about a false light you're not long ago you all remember that greatest robbery that that England ever had yeah that was done it's a seven million dollar holder I don't think there's ever been anything in the world to compare with it a great hold up reasonably of seven million dollars even Scotland yards can't get it figured out you know higher than it by a false light they put a light on the railroad track caution on down so they come to a red light and stop them and they're the robbery taking place just at the right place a false light gave the greatest robbery that the Nations has ever known it robbed the nations of the greatest holdup greatest robbery it was done by a false light and the greatest robbery the Church of God has ever had is a false fight amen Rob them from the power of the Holy Ghost it's cut from the church the very Lifeline amen amen it's robbed them of the word when they accepted a Creed instead of the word it's Robin all they claim to have the word the word lives itself out for the age it makes itself known they claim they had the word too back there in the days of Jesus but he said they saw a great light and they rejected it yes they saw it but rejected it whole false light this has cost the church the greatest robbery had ever had cold and nominational Creeds brother won't write him a Vindicated word no green amen the Bible said Jesus said the word of God is a a seed that is sore so see and coal Creeds won't ripen that word no no cold blizzardy dates won't write in the week no one is it takes the warmth of the sunlight because it was God's spoken word to do such a thing with you know take the word spoken of God today to show the saints of God that Jesus Christ lives that's the same as he was yesterday he is today Creeds and denominations will never do it they're cold and indifference of green or rot right in the ground it can't come forth under that that's reasonable the day we have a what we do like our precious brother Billy Graham the great revivalist I think God is using the man but look what he does goes out there amongst them Baptists and prayers but during what I do get a bunch of church joiners see where the southern baptist is crawling down there because they had the most denominations uh where the nomination grow more than any other Protestants the Catholics took them all in early last year is it in favor he sure it is yeah don't worry it's going to take them all because it takes Badness and all right together and they're all the one and don't know amen the castle Council of churches put some all of this the same thing amen denomination but why why would you want to stay over here over here as long as you're rejected this what difference does it make unless you're using the same denominational tags just the same as you are one way one of the beasts and the other in the March so there you are this doesn't make any difference it's where he's been he stunk this seal of approval in there you take it yeah and there she all LED right straight to the White House into Washington DC and in the Council of churches and there you go encouragement taking the right all back exactly what the Bible said they do wish I that dude didn't go so fast just think now we're at look at the promises for the day reject it again how the churches have done in this last day the denomination Claire living in the false glare is the reason that it won't write that's the reason this word you don't see the Miracles a priest interviewed me not long ago and he said Mr Branham he said how'd you baptize a certain girl that come out of this church that backslid and married a Catholic boy and went into the Catholic church and he was going to take her into the church I said I'll baptize your Christian baptism he said uh the bishop wants to know I said all right there it is said you swear to this I don't swear at all and he said he said if he can't take my word part well that's all right because I don't swear the Bible said don't swear by Heavens as God's Throne Earth this is what's through let your yes be yes no no I said you have to take the word first well you you said Christian baptism what do you mean by by Mercy I said it's the only way Christian baptism is performed I said I baptize her in the Ohio River tuck her under the water in the name of Jesus Christ and brought her up I baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the only Christian baptism there is amen So Yesterday put it down like that he said strange said you know the Catholic Church used to baptize that last of win and he said I'm going to hit the discussion went on for a while and he said well we are the original Catholic knowing they're laid right there the the books and all the history on it I said that's true but I said why don't you do it today amen amen amen he said we have power to remit sins said Jesus did he tell his disciples whosoever sins you were admitted to them they're remitted whosoever sends you retain to them to retain I said yes or he did he said then don't they give the church The Authority Peter was the head of the church I said if the church WIll remit sins the way Peter did it I said now when he asked what must we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissioner I said you're trying to plead a Bible that's the word he said God's in his church I said God's in his word amen every man of the man's words alive this is the truth so there's no agency but there they go right on in darkness and the Protestants by the thousands falling into it here they are right down to adopting their Creeds and things going right on within the word coming right up proven Jesus Christ manifest himself same yesterday if ever and that Creed glare they moved right on out into darkness amen just like they did in those time just like they did at all times they do it again today right out in darkness why they reject the light because the Creed has blinded them oh what a darkened hour that we are in now yeah they reject Christ through eternal life and that's what does it cold in nominations can never bring life to the word of God because it brings life to the denomination we've got more professed Christians right now look here if the Christian I asked this Priestess if I'll go with you that the Catholic church was at the beginning at Pentecost because not at now I see a room that's right the church never did begin it now I see a Rome amen it began at Pentecost you see at Jerusalem is where the church began but I said here I'll admit that these people them slaves and things that got the Holy Ghost they Master seen their powers and things what they were doing raising the dead speaking in tongues casting out Devils foretelling things and Prophets among them and so forth come out with sheepskins around them eat nerves come to that Nastia Council and so forth a great man and there they come out of there and come up there to let Nastia Castle was standing for that word yeah but that Bloody 15 days they accepted father Son and Holy Ghost as a Creed instead of the Bible Doctrine in the name of Jesus Christ through that come all the Protestant church is born right into it the same thing all these other things a false conception of the Holy Ghost they took take the communion drink the wine that is the Holy Eucharist which means holy ghost the priest gives it to you now the Bible don't read on the day of Pentecost and fully come here come a priest up the road caller turned around said they got your tongue and take the Holy Eucharist no it didn't say all you people right up here and give me the right hand of Fellowship ship you Baptist Methodist and bad I'll put your name bring a letter from somewhere you said they were all in one place and won a car and suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a Russian didn't filled all the room where they were setting they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance in there out into the street they went staggering like drunk man marrying all the rest of them are the impact of the Holy Ghost but the people said laughed at him and said these men are full of new wine what was it blinded by a Creed amen that little two before preacher stood up there named Peter he said you man of Judy and you that dwell are you a man of Jerusalem and dwell in Judea let this mean on you and hearken my words these are not drunk but let me tell you what the scripture says it'll be this is the light this is the word being manifested amen amen same thing happens today and they do like they did then walked away and shake their heads yeah said let them alone blind leads are blind they all fall in the ditch oh it takes Christ eternal life to bring the word of life to the Vindication made flesh oh my goodness that takes the word takes the Holy Ghost to operate the word of God Amen when Jesus said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and I look Mark 16 his last commission all the world all the world it never has got there yet all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and all the world and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe they'll shake hands you know they'll be good church members in my name they shall cast out devils amen they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and drink daily things that won't harm them if you lay their hands on the sick they shall recover oh my God how far Every Creature how much all the world so he comes again these signs shall he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even greater than this will he do I'll go to my father oh how we can walk away from that it's more than I can see we are in more Darkness now than they were yeah he's got a couple more verses here I want to get to the end as quick as possible we're in more Darkness than Dave was I know I'll wear you out here this tape's going on in there they're more darkest than we are I made the statement that why the churches in this glare is so deceiving it looks like it's the truth now didn't Jesus say uh that's me Matthew 24. Matthew 24 Jesus said that in the last days the two spirits will be so close till it were to see the very elected if it was possible there would be an elected group come out to make the church in the last days and these organizations with what they call their truth would be so close like the real thing that it would deceive the very elected even Pentecostals now you know you ain't gonna take a Pentecost and deceiving with some Methodist or Baptist Doctrine you ain't gonna tell him that he knows better you go to see some bad just for the Lutheran Doctrine either I think and neither you go to receive the message they see a message not in this word for some Pentecostal amen all father son Holy Ghost and all this stuff like that back there them Creeds that they have that organization set up and go into eating you'll never deceive them because the elected won't be deceived that's right what is it what is it deceiving these glares what are they doing they're leading the church to the council Slaughter by their glare that will be the final Slaughter once her in Rome connects together yeah when they form that image of the beast that's a final Slaughter and these glares that you got now look what it's doing Leading the People it's a goat a goat always leads the Sheep to the slaughter yeah it is you've seen that in Slaughter pins that gold run right out there and leave the sheet and he'll jump out and let sleep go on him that's what he does it always does it was a ghost that led Jesus to lamb to the slaughter the Roman goats that's right it's a it's the denominational goats today that's leading the innocent sheep to the slaughter put their South their names on that book shatter and they're finished that is the mark of the beast Amen in the name of the Lord I speak for a long time that's true exactly what is the Beast what is the Beast it's a Roman hierarchy the first organization what is the mark of it the same thing exactly the same thing exactly as that was the slaughter to the glare but in the face of the present Darkness we still have seen the light of God shine through Earth how thankful we are for that amen listen close we have seen the light his word that he promised for this day proven and Vindicated amen it's the truth the light all the hours oh my I'm so glad there's nothing wrong no listen you're an ongoing Minister was saying they was down in Florida and he had him a car but he was a Chevrolet and the thing uh went out on him he couldn't get it fixed he went into the garage and a little mechanic was going hunting over it and pecking around

Hallelujah that faith in his promised word or today flow through you'll see on Opry twice he designed the thing amen he designed his church.org that's what he puts together not by Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian Pentecostal organization but by his word amen shall live not by bread but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God yes sir get all them glares amen in the midst of Darkness this dark time that we're living in now has just got about five minutes more left in the midst of Darkness who's going to bring the little bride out who knows about it the chief designer all right oh

these men set together at nicaea why is it you haven't got the power that they had back there in the beginning why don't you do the things that they did which Jesus said I said oh we are more people now we we live in a different age I said but the word doesn't change he said these signs shall follow us heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never right that's it he said you're talking about a Bible I said yes the word which is Christ right and uh so there you are see and in this Clare the method is showing there is the Baptist showing there's the Presbyterian there each one growing bigger and bigger all the time the poor little she put her name on there and she'd say well come to find out look what they do they come over here and you got to belong to us if you don't belong to our church you're not even in the bride you're not even nothing go over here at the assemblies and look what they got there you are again going down to the Baptist look what they got yeah look their prayers what's going to happen to the poor little thing but she's coming forward don't you hey man she's going to be there yeah a fella was saying here about a couple years ago is down in New Mexico I held a meeting there close to Carlsbad Caverns you've heard of them down there they're great and they tell a man and his wife and a bunch of children but on this elevator and went all the way down to the very bottom of the pit and when they go down there they turned all the lights off and when they turned all the lights off it was midnight dark I had him do that over here and these Gardens here and at one time at the over in Colorado their wife and I back there was in there they turned them lights oh my you put your hand like this you couldn't see nothing and there was a little girl standing there and she began screaming screaming she was scared to death it was so dark the poor little thing was grabbing everywhere trying to scream and holler for a papa mama everywhere she just couldn't stand it it was so dark she never seen such Darkness and that's about the way it is now yeah that's right it's so dark you don't know where to go yeah you go to Methodist go to bed let's go to praise there's all the same thing eating that old dead rotten man come in Jordan just another that old Creed and everything you don't see Christ in it all you see self-righteous people many are fine people in there now in them denomination I'm saying the system amen not the people in there but you see that's what they're eating on tell them about it here's fresh food amen this little girl standing there she's screaming atop her voice about going to his theories about like the little bride is but you know what her little brother Cried Out said little sister don't fear of course you're standing right to the engineer said there's a man here who can turn on the lights don't fear little sister there's a man here who can turn make this word live yes we don't know how he's coming we don't know how when he's coming I don't know about that but he's here and he can turn all the lights yeah how are we going to get out of it I don't know but he's here and he's the one that can turn on the lights yes sir he is the one he is the light he just makes himself going that's how he turns on the line exactly right it takes Christ to flash away on his lights and all the darkness scatters he separates he's pulling his little bride out I'll take a people out of the Gentiles or my name's sake they'll have my name what is his name all right not Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran it's Jesus Christ yeah that's right he is the light the truth to life there's no darkness in him and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word the word is alive that's right because he spoke to let there be light that was a word to become like when he speaks this it's a lot of that age each time now he shared uh in in not in a glare but people are living declare but he is the abindicated word he is absolutely the the light in the time of Darkness yes sir all these false glares and things will fade away yes sir he is here don't fear turn on the lights this promised word it lives it makes he that believeth in me the works that I do ye do also then it is the word as the father sent me so send I you the father that sent him come in him Jesus that sent you comes in you and the works that he did then he does the same thing because why the word is made flesh in human flesh manifest itself as the light there it is it's just showing the way to light and the light wise man who are not blinded by Creeds and denomination will walk in that light oh my there is a man here that can turn on the lights all right what does he do by vindicating his word for this day Jesus the son of God who promised the word for this day is right here with us don't get scared don't pay attention to what they're doing you do you'll walk in darkness be wise they either do wise Daniel said in these last days will do exploits for their God they're walking the light is he's in the light don't worry it may be dark look like you're going to force us everyone all these you see the proximation going out all these little churches and things are got to come in now you've got to come in or they're going to close you up they're going to make it now we want to hit that real hard tonight when we get to this time let's see now that we're going to close up you have to be one of them or not you're you're either into that or you can't do nothing can't even buy or sell amen you're embarrassing to pray for the sick if you're caught minister to any sick or any person with any spiritual thing in there you're subject to a federal law to be executed you're exactly right yes sir so you cannot do it you have to belong to the cult brother let me tell you something you better get Christ sure in your heart right now amen because there is a Time coming where you're really going to need it you're not then remember when that Seal's put on she's there for good amen don't you do don't you believe that stuff you get right into Christ right now the word yes sir vindicates the word and shows that it is the light of the hour that's how we know he is alive because he is the light manifest himself in flesh how do we know he was God's word made flesh see God's word was showing itself vindicating himself when the Messiah cometh what he'll do the woman said the Well when the Messiah cometh he'll do these things you must be the prophet which is the word foretelling to see things he said I am he yeah that's enough the light shine on the promised word there's a light right in the city she went and said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this a very Messiah yeah that was it no matter what the other said she knew that was Messiah remember in every age and time of Darkness God has always had his word to divide the light from the dark he had to the days of Luther when the Catholic church had everything he sent Luther as a Shining Light and Luther divided truth from darkness and when the lutherans got twisted up he made of John Wesley and he divided light from darkness in the days of Pentecost when the West End got all and the methodists got all gummed up in the Baptist and Presbyterian he sent the Pentecostal message to separate life from Darkness the Pentecost went right back out into the darkness again like that in their organization tucked their Creeds and things now The Hours come for this word to be Vindicated he sends a light the word made manifest like he did in the beginning sends the word and it proves itself there is light and he always separates the same is now as Eternal lights in the beginning looking children as I say I'm five minutes past time now let me say this one thing there is a man present don't get scared no matter what they say I said it come to the spot to where I didn't know where to move next but he's always present the never failing presence he's always there he can turn on the line amen yes sir he's just waiting see what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to yes sir there's a man here that can turn on the lights those he set in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer some of them under uh the death of denomination some of them under Creed's death some of them under traditional death and all them kinds of death and they have seen a great light the man deflects the lights then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be like that same God yesterday the day and forever he's present today right here now don't get scared he can turn on the lights but the persecution comes don't get scared there's a lion said he catches people away shall not go through the tribulation [Applause] right up to the fiery furnace but there's a man there yes sir that Russian Mighty Wind to come down with a Pentacles he turned it on again and fanned all the breeze away from him there was a man there he's called a fourth man yeah there's one here today and he's the only one Hallelujah the light switch in his hand oh she said in the regions of the shadow of death great light sprung up don't reject it receive it in the name of the Lord we [Music] will walk in the line beautiful House of Mercy our bride shine all around us by day and by night Jesus it's such a beautiful life it comes where the Dew drops off Mercy our bride shine all around us [Music] [Music] what is the Vindicated word is Jesus today he is a word [Music] [Music] oh shine all around us with your heads bowed I wonder how many here would like to walk in this line under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the Vindicated word of the day see the word that God promised today sit manifested wasn't that what he was in the beginning he was the word the son was born he was a word he was a messiah he was the Vindicated word so then the word God spoke to the the end from the beginning now there's a word for this day yeah and he's here amen vindicating that word in the midst of confusion darkness and glares it looks a whole lot like it but it isn't it it don't prove to be it the creep Jesus said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out oh yeah they didn't cast them out but no if I cast out a devil by the Finger of God then the kingdom of God is coming out oh let's think of it as we raise our hands slowly I think real but we walk in this light such a beautiful and it comes with your confession believe God Jesus it's such a beautiful life it comes where the Dew drops of Mercy all right foreign [Music] [Music] what did they do walked out into God's judgmental what happened to Pharaoh in the days of the life of the burning bush that was in Moses walked into the sea of death what happened to David who started and then rejected the light walked into the crack of the earth and swallowed him up what happened in all ages to those who failed to walk in the light the light of the day it's Jesus all the time it was Jesus in the days of that man it's Jesus today for he is the word and the word makes Delight it's the light of the day think of it now real quietly while we're with sincerity asked are you walking in the lion while we hum it through again [Music] shine all around us oh Jesus [Music] let's stand up now to our feet [Music] I pray the heavenly father let this message soak deep into the hearts of the people who are present those who will hear it by tape and may the light come forth upon the word the seed and bring forth ever predestinated seed that's been planted out here in these different glares organizations may they see like Nicodemus even if they have to come benite come to the light Granite father May there come forth this great issue of this rock that's cut out a mountain without hands it'll Crush these Gentile kingdoms to the ground all these Kingdom spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms and The Rock will cover the whole earth it'll be a purified affair those who that rock Crush will be ground into Power those who fall upon that rock shall have a solid foundation oh Christ let me as your servant bow Upon This Rock This Rock of Thy word Lord God let me stand as David and them Warriors of all who stood far David let me stand for this word today while I see it's rejected by the denominations it's laying up here in a little Retreat somewhere oh God I grant that we'll have strength and courage and the Holy Spirit to stand for that hours are getting darker and darker but let us always remember it's your present to turn on the light in any hour that you wish to you can turn the light father so we pray as you said ye are the life of the world Grant Lord that our lights who are of your service will shine so bright to the others that they'll see the light of the Gospel people as we live it Lord day by day reflecting to them the life of Jesus Christ as he was on Earth full of humility and sweetness yet with the word be lived right through him bring it Lord or we're looking to you the great one with the switch in the hand Lord you hold the world in your hand you hold all things in your hand and uphold the World by Your Word oh father let us receive the word will you please Lord let that be the testimony of the desire of every heart in your fathers we sing these hymns David sung the hymns they become prophecy they were prophecy and you recognize that prophecy As we sing it Lord let it be in our hearts too as we sing we'll walk in this life Let It Be Lord this is a beautiful life it's the word it's Christ living among us not what he was what he is and we know what he was only reflected what he is and we pray father that the people understand and walk in this beautiful light we asked in Jesus name while we remain standing just a moment I want us to all saying now in here there's Presbyterian Methodist Catholic this is a mixed up audience when it comes to denominational now remember let it be known that I'm speaking in us and against the people in these glares but I proved it to the Bible that they are glares amen if it wasn't Christ would be doing like he promised to do with them amen but they refuse that see and when you get there what do you find adjourn the church recite a Creed and what does it cannot come to the end of the road you find out is a false Mirage Christ is the word live now while you can live you live for something what are you living for so he can die every one of you what are you working for to eat what are you eating for to live what are you living for to die so why not live to live why not live to live then the only way you can live is accept the word because man should not live by bread alone what we make out here with a sweater of a brown but by every word that comes from the mouth of God now the word of the mouth of God is being Vindicated right here before by the Holy Spirit live by it won't you now I want while we sing this again that's just each one you stand in our place reach over and take hold of somebody's hands and say brother let's walk in this life while we sing walk in the light will you pray for each other as you put your hands together while we sing together with closing our eyes as far as possible [Applause] [Music] hello who is it Jesus now let's raise your hands [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] along here [Music] [Music] with our heads bound now remember when Israel was in their Journey Eating new Mana every day they walked in the light of a pillar of fox yes that Pillar of Fire was Jesus Christ the Bible says it was and today he is with us we have it we know he's with us the same Pillar of Fire doing the same things that he did when he was sure on Earth to fulfill his word as we go from here let's remember keep that song in our hearts if we go to our homes as the wheels hum a song before you eat your dinner bow your head and thank God for sending forth light to bring food upon the Earth or your physical body then thank God for sending spiritual light his word that he might give food to the soul or a man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds mouth of God keep saying in this hymn to yourselves in your home among your people and meet us back here about 6 30 tonight for the prayer cards and so forth we'll see you then until then bow your heads and go to ask brother Neville if you walk up here now the pastor and dismisses the Lord of Prayer amen oh I keep wanting to stop the tape and make comments you know every every few sentences there's golden nuggets there's so many things we could go into and talk about but praise God how many are glad that he's here and that we can walk in the light and that the light separates Darkness from light and it pushes the darkness away amen let's go to page 33. in our book where we started from the first question that we asked was how do we bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ and brother Branham says in paragraph 181 he starts talking about the Queen of England that visited the paper mill and she saw the dirty rags and couldn't believe that the paper was made out of the dirty rags and so they after she left he's just talking about this through there and I'll go down to paragraph 182 so after she was gone the man took the same dirty pile of rags and run them through a certain process and brought them out clean pure paper and you know had been went through a process and made Rio and put her profile in it and sent it to reflecting herself and what she called dirty rags now that's what it is the dead things of yesterday the message of Luther the message of Wesley the message of Pentecost if it can only go through the process of God's Holy Spirit and the word of a Vindication it'll bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ the King amen but if you leave it lay it's dirty rags now where brother Benham started this thought is up here in paragraph 180 so I want to go up and catch it and then come back down just above paragraph 187 says you say then why was it good yesterday he's talking about previous ages talking about Luther's age and Wesley's age why was it good yesterday if you only knew that the very little Hall that was on the wheat at the beginning if it abides in the grain it makes the grain further that's the very thing that makes the wheat flour is what was yesterday but if it separates itself from the Grain and it don't mature then it goes away but if it goes through the process of life-giving process as it dies out and just Blends into something else and makes the grain if it isn't where does it come from amen so he's talking about what was what was uh Hall one day has to become grain it's got to keep moving as the life matures and as it moves it goes through the process but anywhere it stops and remains back here in the plant and doesn't move on with the life then it dies so then he comes down to the dirty rags amen and he says it with clothing and one day amen but when it didn't move on it became dirty rag but if it'll go through the process of the word amen and to be purified and then God will use it so let's go down to paragraph 184. it's got to be molded in something else Luther has got to be molded into Wesley and Wesley has got to be molded in the Pentecost and Pentecost has got to be molded into Christ it goes through a process so has the gospel gone through a process it's processing Luther's age of justification we believe that Wesley of sanctification we believe that the Pentecostals of the restoration the gifts for the Holy Ghost we believe that certainly but mold it all together what you come out with Jesus right the same yesterday today and forever it'll come out with Jesus when a man is in a Foundry it is making a bell he's got a certain tone he has to put in it then he is setting his mold and pouring his iron he puts in so much brass so much steel so much copper he knows just exactly how much to put in to make it give at that right tone and that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had put so much Luther so much Methodist so much Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it but what does he come out with his own reflection so all the truth that was there has to move to the next and mold into the next and then accumulates all the truth now of all seven Church ages amen and brings out of the glory of church and what does the church become the reflection of Jesus Christ as it goes to the process he goes on to say what is it just like the pyramid message you see it's heaping right up this coming to the minority with the headstone the ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth has to be the same as the ministry he had or he can't come to it praise God let's go down to paragraph uh 189 actually on the next page paragraph 189. I'm going to go to the second sentence oh God if we can only understand that we are the reflection of Jesus Christ his word may manifest you are the reflection of his word so what did all the church Ages come for and one growing into the next it came to make you the reflection of Jesus Christ a point let's look at uh let's back up I skipped one let's back up to paragraph 187 on the previous page now yes sir the clean rides are the dirty rags of yesterday if you remain that way it'll just become dirty rags all the time it served its purpose as clothing but now it's become paper justification served his time in justification under Luther then it had to become sanctification through Wesleyan sanctification served his time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost served his time until the Holy Spirit which there's only one God Blends into the church and the church into Christ it makes Jesus Christ reflected on Earth what he promised here in the Bible what the whole process of the church Ages was for is to get the reflection of Jesus Christ in human flesh why human flesh ours praise God all right let's go to question number two what caused the greatest robbery the Church of God had paragraph 225 over here in page 41. paragraph 225 in the middle page 41. and the greatest robbery the Church of God has ever had is a false light a glare their denomination it's robbed them from the power of the Holy Ghost it's took from the church the very Lifeline it's robbed them of the word when they accepted a Creed instead of the word it's robbed them oh they claim to have the word the word living lives itself out for the age it makes itself known they claim they have the word too back there in the days of Jesus but it said they saw a great light and they rejected it they saw it but they rejected him oh false light yes it cost the church the greatest robbery it ever had cold denominational Creed's brother won't ripen a Vindicated word a grain amen it takes the word for the day this I thought was interesting this next question question three how does the church remit sins let's go to the next page page 43 paragraph 236. I'm going to go to the second sentence he said we have power to remit sins he's talking to the Catholic priest we have power to emit sins that Jesus didn't he didn't he tell his disciples whomsoever sins you remit to them they're remitted and whomsoever sins you retain to them they are retained I said yes sir he did he said then don't that give the church The Authority Peter was the head of the church I said if the church WIll remit sends the way Peter did it I said now when they asked what must we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ from Mission your sins and you do that and I'll go with you so they said doesn't the church have the power to remit sins and they're talking about Catholic priests resolving people's sins amen and he says if you'll do it the way Peter did and how did Peter did he gave them the revelation of the word for their hour and when they submitted to it their sins were remitted he said now the church has the power to remit sins but not because she says your sins are gone she has the power of His sins because she has the present truth which is Jesus Christ she has the blood which is the spirit amen and when that's accepted and received it'll remit sins it's the word it's the word the present day word but look here he goes on to say oh he said you're trying to plead a Bible I said that's the word he said God is in his church I said God is in his word every man other man's word is a lie his word is truth this is really important because it goes right back to the question I asked what guided them to the light it was the word and and this is a a interesting dialogue that brother Benham is having with a Catholic priest because the Catholic said oh God is in his church and we know that's also true is that true God is in his church amen and they're taking a promise to the bride upon themselves falsely so but that's a promise to the bride of Christ a true church that God is in his church amen but what they did with that Revelation is they made themselves the authority of the word and they gave themselves the right to adjust it or change it so they took a true Revelation and by a true Revelation misappropriated amen they lost the guide to the word and they became their own guide and could no longer find the word and why this is so important is because the truth and error are so close they travel on such close lines amen now if we do the same thing the Catholic Church says and say we are the bride we are the word and we start interpreting our own word we'll do the same exact thing the Catholic Church did but this word amen that's been revealed to us through a prophetic ministry will guide us to the light every time we can never become our own guide and to me that's that's where I believe the bride must stay on that Razor's Edge where she is the word for the day amen she she is the Tabernacle of deity absolutely she's the manifestation of the word for this day amen but she can never become her own interpreter of the word amen there's already been the interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication through a prophetic Ministry to bring us back to the truth of the Bible amen and that's why it's so important we don't start coming up with our own Revelations amen it's a Catholic spirit and it's dangerous to keep saying we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride amen God gave us one thing to check everything with and that's his Bible amen and we don't take our own interpretation we take the interpretation that's been given to us in this day this ministry praise God but then if we get so self-confident that as if as if everybody in the bride agrees on something will be right that doesn't make it right because you don't know that everybody around you's bride praise God we have to stick with the word so I think this is so super important the day that we live in Deception comes in many ways but it always comes close to the truth we have to stick with the word that's been revealed in our day let's go to question number four question number four is who is the chief mechanic and I also want to add and the designer of the word and the man who can turn on the light let's go to paragraph 255 255 on the top of page 47. in the paragraph 255 brother Brown starts talking about the man who Minister said trying to get his car fixed in Florida and the mechanic couldn't do it and then A well-dressed man walks up to him and he's we got this at the bottom of paragraph 255. finally a nice Dressed Man stepped up he said may I give you some advice the little mechanic had a sense enough to say yes sir he said you take this times this and this and he said put that together once and try it and he took this times that and put it together and there she went the little mechanic turned around and said say who are you he was the engineer General Motors chief engineer he made the thing he was the one who designed it and today when we're talking about Methodist Baptist Presbyterian the chief mechanic is here the designer of the word the man who created the heavens and earth and designed his church listen we don't need the nomination amen the chief engineer is here the designer of the word the designer of his church he's here and he says does he know more about what it takes for the Rapture or does the Methodist or Baptist which know more about what it takes he is the designer he knows what it takes he is well dressed in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah he is walking among us today in the power of his resurrection oh when brother bam he talks about the well-dressed man has stepped up there's another well-dressed man who stepped up he's not here in flesh he's robed in the power of his resurrection amen showing that he is alive today doing the same thing he did then that's the robe of his resurrection power it's the Messianic sign that was on display it's the one who can open the seals amen he's in the power he's dressed in the power of his resurrection so how are you going to see Jesus Christ he's well dressed and the power of his resurrection he's walking among us today and the power of his resurrection he knows what it takes to put a church in Rapture order he designed it and put the parts together here in the Bible and just let the current flow through it now watch it operate let faith in his promised word of today flow through you'll see how it operates why he designed the thing he designed his church by the word that's what he puts together not by Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian or Pentecostal organization but by his word man shall live not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God oh praise God let's look at paragraph 265. the bottom of page 48. brother Brandon begins to talk about the caves in Carlsbad Caverns and a family went down and he's going to get into the little boy and little girl at the top of page 49 we'll pick it up there and there was a little girl standing there and she began screaming oh screaming she was scared to death it was so dark the poor little thing was grabbing everywhere and trying to scream and holler for a papa mama everywhere she just couldn't stand it it was so dark she'd never seen such darkness and that's about the way it is now that's right it's so dark you don't know where to go you go to the Methodist go to the Baptist go to Presbyterian it's all the same thing see eating the old dead rotten Mana with wiggle tails in it see same thing same Creed come in and join this and the other and the other that old Creed and everything you don't see Christ in it you see self-righteous people many are fine people in there now and then the nominations I'm saying the system not the people in there but you see what they're eating on tell them about it and here is fresh food and this little girl standing there she was screaming top of her voice about to go into sterics about like the little bride is but you know her little brother which is brother Branham her little brother Cried Out said little sister which is the bride don't fear because he was standing right by the engineer how many times on that platform did he say he's right beside me amen who was the little brother brother Branham who was the little sister the bride he's standing right by the engineer he saw the engineer he knows the engineer he knows he's present and he knows there's nothing to be worried about amen he's standing right by the engineer he said there is a man here who can turn on the lights don't fear little sister now this is just brother Ben I'm talking he's now himself talking because he's taking the part of the little brother don't fear little sister there is a man here who can turn on the light who is the man the chief engineer the designer of the word the designer of his bride amen let's go from there over to paragraph 278 on page 51 paragraph 278 look children as I say I'm five minutes past time now but let me say this one thing there is a man present don't get scared no matter what they say I've seen it come to the spot where I didn't know where to move next but he's always present the never failing presence he's always there he can turn on the light yes sir he is just waiting to see what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to what a lesson amen our little brother the prophet of the age told us don't be scared because there's a man here which is Christ Jesus who can turn on the light he's just wanting to see what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to yes sir there is a man here that can turn on the lights those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer some of them under death a denomination some of them undercreased now he's back in Matthew chapter four his opening scripture some of them under Creed's death some of them under traditional death and all kinds of death and they have seen a great line the man that flashed the lights then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light the same God yesterday today and forever he is present today right here now don't get scared he can turn on the lights did that chief engineer leave when the prophet left no but there's still a man here that can turn on the lights praise God there's nothing to be afraid of question number five how does he turn on the light let's go back to paragraph 267. paragraph 267. on page 49 I'm going to start in the middle of that paragraph don't fear little sister there is a man here who can turn on the light he can make this word live we don't know how he's coming we don't know how when he's coming I don't know nothing about that but he is here I love that he is here and he can turn on the lights how are we going to get out of it I don't know but he's here and he's the one that can turn on the lights yes sir he's the one he is the light he just makes himself known that's how he turns on the lights how does he do it he just reveals himself in the situation He makes himself known and that's how he turns on the lights it takes Christ to flash away his life then all the darkness scatters he separates he's pulling his little bride out I'll take a people out of the Gentiles for my namesake that'll have my name what is his name all right not Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran it's Jesus Christ that's right let's look at paragraph 269 over on the top of page 50. paragraph 269 there is a man here that can turn on the lights all right what does he do by vindicating his word for this day Jesus the son of God who promised the word for the this day is right here with us how do you turn on light by vindicating his word for the day he turned on the lights amen I want to look at uh paragraph 273 down at the bottom of this page he vindicates the word and shows that it is the light of the hour that's how we know he is light because he is the light manifesting itself in flesh there's a man here can turn on the light and he's shining the light through human flesh I mean I want to look at paragraph 285 if we turn the page before I read 285 I want to go over here to the left side on page 52 down at the bottom in between where he's singing we'll walk in the light he breaks in with his sins he said what is it the Vindicated word is Jesus today he is the word so many people are crying out for Jesus and looking for Jesus where is Jesus he's here he's well dressed in the power of his resurrection showing still today the sign of the Messiah amen the Vindicated word is Jesus today he is the word let's go to the next page page 53 down at the bottom paragraph 285 I'm going to go down to the middle of the paragraph it's Jesus all the time it was Jesus in the days of the man it's Jesus today for he is the word and the word makes the light it's the light of the day he said it was Noah was the light of this day John was the light of the day Elijah was the light of his day Moses was the light of the day but he said it was Jesus all the time amen it's the same person and now the bride is the light of the day but it's Jesus it's the man here who can turn on the light and he can turn it on in your life by vindicating his word In You and I by living his life by manifesting and declaring himself in US praise God amen before we finish I want to take a look at one other thing there was a something that came up the last time that I skipped over I didn't want to go into it until we got to the end and let's go back to paragraph 138 138 on page that was 138 and page 25. brother Ben is going to talk about a dream Billy Paul had and I found this dream fascinating brother Brown doesn't give the interpretation of the dream so I don't know what the full interpretation or the accurate interpretation of the dream is but I just want to look at it in the light of so many things that the prophet of God has said to us and he says in paragraph 138 in the middle of page 25 my son Billy Paul he talks in his sleep but he doesn't have dreams very often he had one the other night that shook him up said he dreamed he was in church and I hadn't come in yet he said when I come in fire was flying out of my eyes I said the time is here it's over brother bam at the end of this dream says it was a dream given to him of the Lord that's what he says and you see the fire flying out of brother branham's eyes amen it reminds me of Revelation chapter one The the image of Jesus Christ amen he had eyes as flames of fire amen so it's it's Christ amen he's the son of man and now we know that brother Brennan was Ace on a man revealing the son of man and those eyes are eyes of judgment and there's flames shooting out of his eyes he said the time is here it's over and everybody begin to scream I can't my children and even my wife said I can't get Sarah to ask the blessing at the table and so forth and I said he said I got to get Lois and the baby I said Lois can't come now the baby's too young to know Billy the hour's here we must go I said it's midnight now with midnight is when the bridegroom call comes and was he giving them the bridegroom call absolutely he said it's midnight now before daylight Jesus will be here amen if it isn't then I'm a false witness of Christ and somebody spoke up said now no man knows the men under the hour I never said men in her hour I said sometime between now and daylight and I said but we're at the time let's go and he got in the car and started and we started up the mountain and when we did it was looked like the light was coming in the skies but dark upon the Earth so it is at the rising of the Sun he said I pulled off to the side of the road and I held my hands over like this and fire still flying from my eyes and and he said I said Lord I have did this at your command amen and that ties you right back to Elijah in The Showdown and he's got the ministry of Elijah and the Mount Carmel Showdown said Lord I've did this at your command I have did this just because that you told me to do it this way I did these things according to what you've told me and I motioned to a big Granite Mountain and a light without hands so brother Branham is not cutting the stone he just motioned to a Granite Mountain but a light and what did he tell us the light was the light was the word and a light without hands cut a stone which this stone is Christ a light without hands cut a stone out of the mountain weighing hundreds of tons and here it come I said turn your hands heads don't look it'll be over in just a few minutes I said then a great holy hush come everywhere as this Stone come towards a place almost like silence in heaven for the space of half an hour it may be later than we think there see the that's exactly scriptural you see the stone without hands cut out of the mountain and so one of these days it's going to be that way when you're going to scream for something I said to them you've already had that time God has constantly warned you time after time yeah I said even if it's my own kid or whoever it is the hour is here I can only say what he's told me to say and it'll be there and it was then all of a sudden Brother Bear claps his hands there he says here comes the stone cut out of the mountain without hands Daniel saw that you know back many years ago Billy knew nothing about that it was it was a dream sent to him from the Lord so brother remember said it was a dream sent in from the Lord I don't know what will be the full interpretation of that or how much will unfold out of that but this one thing I know is that brother Brandon was standing there a son of man revealing the son of man and he was here amen as a prophet as a judge amen and he and he gave us the word amen through him came the word The Light Came that cut the revelation of Jesus Christ the seventh seal out of the word to show us that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and we know that stone is Christ and it was cut out by the Light by the word without hands wasn't a man it was God's word amen that showed the revelation of Jesus Christ was the mystery of the whole Bible because Christ is the mystery of God revealed now let's look at a few things he says further on let's go to paragraph 158. paragraph 158. brother Branham is is admonishing the the church ages uh let's go just above paragraph 158 in the middle of the previous paragraph it says living in a Lutheran glare living in a Wesley glare a Baptist a presbyterian or some Nazarene glare of another church age that went on and organized and done the same thing and refused to rejected the light when it is actually shining and you're living in a mirage I say that reverently see but you're not not to hurt you but to wake you up you're living in a mirage what if Jesus says while you're blind and you're leading the blind he tried to tell them and didn't do it said let them alone that the blind leaves the blind they'll all fall on the ditch that's the hour I've come to if they're going to stagger I can't help it don't all I can do I've done exactly I've done this at your command Lord You're my witness now he begins to repeat what he repeated in the dream I think he's showing us we're at that time the midnight hour has come the midnight call sometime between now amen and the rising of the new day in the Millennium amen that this is all taking place we've already come to the Midnight Hour the revelation of Christ the seventh seal has been cut out of the of the of the mountain amen and it's been moving into position that stone is a headstone for the bride amen it's a sown a stone of Destruction for everyone else and Jesus Christ when he comes Amen to destroy the Nations he destroys him with a sword coming out of his mouth what is that his word brother Branham says he smites them he destroys them with the word but what word does he destroy them with the same thing he destroys them with is the same thing he saves us with and the stone that destroys one caps another praise be to God let's go to paragraph 162. I'm going to pick it up in the in the middle of the paragraph Luther's Mana was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration to guess but this is introducing the headstone we're Beyond Pentecost the restoration of gifts he said this is introducing the headstone the last day Bright Tree which is contrary to all of it and yet it's the same light for for the matured let's go to page 31 the next page over right in the middle paragraph 170. and watch as it went forward it grew stronger and stronger and so was the real little minority of the church growed from justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and now to the coming Capstone shaping itself up no more organ organizations after this there won't be no more we're on the west let's go to paragraph 287. all the way back towards the end 287 on page 54. let's read this this is why I didn't want to get into that dream yet because I wanted to get to this part here at the end paragraph 287. May there come forth this great issue of this rock so now brother Brian within he's calling forth this coming forth of this great issue of this rock May there come forth this great issue of this rock that's cut out of the mountain without hands it'll Crush these Gentile kingdoms to the ground all these kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms and The Rock will cover the whole earth it'll be a purified affair those who that rock crushes will be ground under powder those who fall upon that rock shall have a solid foundation o Christ let me as your servant die off on this rock this rock of Thy Word praise God I believe in the opening of the seven sea I believe in the seventh seal is the revelation of Christ and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he was the mystery contained in the entire Bible and what cut it out in the last days when the prophet was on the scene the light cut out that stone and showed us the seven seas and all who fall on that will be built together again we'll be will die off and be resurrected but all on whom that falls on will be destroyed the same Rock brings life and the same Rock brings destruction I don't know the full interpretation of the dream but from the things we've already been told we've seen that profit stand with eyes flaming a fire as a judge and the word that he gave either brings life or brings death because the word separates the light from the darkness you either stay in the darkness or you come to the light I thank God for the day we live in I thank God that that stone was revealed to us and that we can fall and throw ourselves on that stone and be broken from all our denominational ideas and all of our own self-desire and be shattered and put back together to reflect Jesus Christ and that same stone that did a wonderful work for us will bring a destruction and a purification and that same Rock will fill all the Earth what kind of rock is that it's the kingdom of Jesus Christ will fill the Earth will be filled with the word of God amen let's all stand do you believe there's a man here that can turn on the light [Music] who is he he's the chief engineer the one who designed it the one who designed you is here to turn you on I thank God for this message amen this message has meant a lot to me and I really thank God for him amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you for all that you have given to us and all that you've done for us father how can we thank you enough for this word that you've sent God when the earth is groping in darkness and the worst darkness of all is religious Darkness where they believe there's light but it's only a glare God how sad that level of deception is and Lord if not for your mercy and Grace we would all be in the same place but God you you are the chief engineer that's come and you've turned on the light so that we can see oh God I pray that you would turn us on that we would be your lights in this generation shining forth the glory of your Resurrection may your Resurrection be seen in us as you live in US God Noah was a light Moses was a light brother Branham was a light but now you're calling for us to be a light help us God help us to receive all of your word and Stand Fast upon it help us to trust you Lord in the hours of darkness when there's confusion in our minds and uncertainty before us Lord from the what your Prophet told us it looks like it'll get worse it looks like it could get much worse but God you just want to see what we're going to do I pray God that you'll you'll find that we trust you help us God we can't do it of ourselves but God you sent a word to us and turned a light on inside of us that'll let us see who's here And We Trust You Lord God we want to throw ourselves down upon you and we want to be broken Lord broken the peace is Lord shattering our own ideas our selfish desires our own wants break it out of us Lord and then put us together in your word and your very image to reflect
