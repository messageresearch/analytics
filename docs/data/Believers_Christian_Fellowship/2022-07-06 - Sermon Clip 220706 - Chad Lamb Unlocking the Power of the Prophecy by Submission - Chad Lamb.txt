and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leapt in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost here we have a supernatural event taking place mary is coming in and she's saluting or greeting her cousin elizabeth and what was that greeting well we know because brother branham tells us she tells elizabeth in the greeting what happened and that she was going to have a baby and his name was jesus and as soon as she spoke the name jesus john the baptist who was laying as dead within elizabeth sprung to life amen because now one woman carrying a promise speaks to another woman carrying a promise and the woman with the promise when she speaks the promise that's within her brings life to the promise that's in the other woman hallelujah and elizabeth filled with the holy ghost begins to prophesy amen at the same time her husband is mute and her husband has been deemed mute because he doubted the promise zacharias in the temple met the same angel amen that mary met and he doubted the promise and he was made dumb he was made a mute he come out of there could not speak amen because the old system of church doubted the timing of the promise amen so the old system of the church the ministry was their mouth was shut and now god is going to speak through the woman because it very much matches the day that we're in now god is speaking through his bride amen and because she she has received the promise and now mary at the time that her husband's a mute amen and because of his doubt she is now elizabeth now is prophesying over mary [Music] amen you think when we get together to fellowship we're just talking but if you're carrying a promise inside of you amen for this day and somebody else is a promise in them but it may be laying dormant it may be dead it may not they may not have felt it warm and kick and move around inside of them yet but if you've got a promise in you and you just go begin to speak what the angel has told you amen it may just bring to life the promise that's laying in another woman
