[12:18] day
[12:19] amen we appreciate all of the mothers in
[12:22] our midst and
[12:23] god's been good to us i've been greeting
[12:24] the brothers and saying happy mother's
[12:26] day to you too because we all had a
[12:27] mother amen
[12:29] so it's a special day we wouldn't none
[12:30] of us be on this earth without a mother
[12:33] and so we we are thankful for that
[12:36] i wanted to uh give you a little update
[12:38] i got a phone call from brother abraham
[12:40] myra and he got his visa on friday so
[12:43] everything is set the plans are set the
[12:45] tickets are booked and he's planning on
[12:47] being here for the meetings from the
[12:49] 20th to the 22nd
[12:51] and also i spoke with brother donovan
[12:52] and brother donovan would like to host
[12:54] he and his wife would like to host a
[12:56] men's fellowship breakfast that saturday
[12:58] morning the 21st of the weekend of the
[13:00] meetings at 9 30 a.m and right now it's
[13:03] it's scheduled to be at brother
[13:04] donovan's home unless the crowd is too
[13:07] large so
[13:08] so they have an idea of how many to
[13:10] expect they put a sign up sheet out on
[13:11] the welcome desk so if you could please
[13:13] if any of the brothers who were planning
[13:15] on attending that breakfast if you could
[13:17] just sign up out on that sheet at the
[13:18] welcome desk by next sunday so they can
[13:21] get a head count and make their final
[13:23] plans
[13:24] also i'm sure nobody's asked but i'm
[13:26] sure sister stephanie would appreciate
[13:28] any help if any sister would like to
[13:30] help or contribute i'm sure you can talk
[13:32] to them so if you have any questions see
[13:33] brother donovan and so we're thankful
[13:36] for them hosting that we're looking
[13:37] forward to having a good time and a good
[13:39] weekend and i thank god that he worked
[13:41] out all the plans amen god is certainly
[13:43] good to us
[13:45] amen i'd like to while we're standing
[13:47] take our bibles and turn to first john
[13:50] chapter 4.
[13:53] i mean the lord dropped a thought into
[13:55] my heart and
[13:57] i was astounded at how all the messages
[13:59] have worked together
[14:01] this morning i like to preach on perfect
[14:03] love
[14:04] and
[14:04] i was just meditating on mother's day
[14:06] and god just tied these two things
[14:08] together for me so nicely and when i
[14:10] when i when i got done meditating on
[14:13] what the lord dropped in my heart i was
[14:14] astounded at how perfect everything fits
[14:16] in the place almost like somebody
[14:18] orchestrated all the services through
[14:20] statue of a perfect man to end on
[14:22] brotherly kindness on love on mother's
[14:24] day to preach on perfect love and i tell
[14:26] you i was the most shocked of us all i'm
[14:29] like boy god you're good amen
[14:32] so i'm just so happy and so thankful so
[14:34] we want to come to this service grateful
[14:36] to the lord's leadership amen
[14:39] first john chapter 4
[14:41] verse 16.
[14:47] and we have known and believed the love
[14:49] that god hath to us
[14:51] god is love we don't let the soak in
[14:54] this is we're not now we're not talking
[14:55] about emotion
[14:57] now we're not talking about a feeling
[14:59] because god is so much more than an
[15:00] emotion or a feeling whatever love is
[15:02] it's god
[15:03] whatever god is it's love this is the
[15:05] kind of love that we're after
[15:08] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[15:11] dwelleth in god and god in him
[15:15] so this is the love that we're supposed
[15:16] to live in and it's supposed to live in
[15:18] us
[15:20] herein is our love made perfect so how
[15:22] is our love made perfect because we live
[15:25] in that love and that love lives in us
[15:27] so we know we're in god and god's in us
[15:29] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[15:31] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[15:34] because as he is so are we in this world
[15:38] there is no fear in love but perfect
[15:40] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[15:43] torment he that feareth is not made
[15:46] perfect in love
[15:47] we love him because he first loved us
[15:51] amen god bless you as you have your
[15:53] seats
[15:54] he wants god to bless us as we look into
[15:56] this word also
[15:58] amen so we know we love him because he
[16:02] first loved us so if he didn't first
[16:04] love us it means it'd be impossible to
[16:06] love him back so no matter how much we
[16:08] feel that we love god and and we were
[16:11] wanting to find god and wanting to know
[16:13] god our love we know is only a
[16:15] reciprocal love it's only reciprocating
[16:18] to his love he loved us first and if he
[16:20] didn't love us first and we weren't
[16:22] already the object of his love then
[16:24] there would be no way for us to love him
[16:26] back amen so that that is such a
[16:28] consolation for us because if in the
[16:31] depths of your soul you know that you
[16:33] love god and that you want god and want
[16:35] him above everything else what a
[16:37] consolation because where did that love
[16:39] come from that love can only be
[16:41] reciprocating a love that was already
[16:43] extended to you before the foundation of
[16:46] the world
[16:47] so what a comfort that is to us to know
[16:49] that we love him because he loved us
[16:52] first so if he didn't love his first we
[16:53] could never love him
[16:56] and god is love so if we dwell in love
[17:00] we dwell in god and god in us
[17:03] herein is our love made perfect that
[17:06] word perfect means brought to its end
[17:08] finished wanting nothing necessary to
[17:10] completion a complete full love comes
[17:14] when we dwell in him we dwell in this
[17:17] love if we dwell in this love because
[17:19] god is love we dwell in him and he and
[17:21] us hearing is our love made perfect that
[17:24] we may have boldness in the day of
[17:25] judgment because as he is we are in this
[17:27] world why because he's in us
[17:30] and he is love and his love's in us and
[17:32] as he is so are we in this world amen
[17:37] so we it says here there is no fear in
[17:40] love
[17:41] but perfect love cast out fear because
[17:43] fear hath torment
[17:44] i think in the end time this is what
[17:46] makes the bride of jesus christ such a
[17:48] unique people on the face of the planet
[17:50] because the whole world is afraid
[17:53] i mean the entire world is fearful right
[17:55] now and uh and we were talking with some
[17:58] brothers about the level of mental
[18:00] illness is just absolutely off the
[18:02] charts right now
[18:04] and it's because the the media has done
[18:07] a fantastic job through code of
[18:08] frightening everybody to death
[18:10] and people were on a they were on the
[18:13] edge they were on a hare's breath from
[18:14] insanity to begin with and then you pump
[18:17] a ton of fear into them and then what
[18:20] now people are just snapping amen not
[18:22] one at a time but in mass people are
[18:24] just going insane and the world wonders
[18:26] why i mean there's a new endemic amen
[18:29] that's that's mental illness and they
[18:30] wonder what it is it's because you've
[18:32] sown fear into them for for years and
[18:35] years and years and and you sown that
[18:37] fear into them in order to control them
[18:40] but now you've lost control because they
[18:42] lost their minds
[18:45] but brother branham said the world will
[18:46] go totally insane
[18:48] and the only sane people on this planet
[18:50] will be the bride of jesus christ
[18:52] because fear hath torment and the whole
[18:54] world is afraid people under that
[18:56] torment are snapping amen but love
[18:59] perfect love cast out fear so you have a
[19:02] people who have the ability to have a
[19:04] sound mind by the love of god
[19:07] amen
[19:09] this love is is very unique
[19:11] uh
[19:12] it's we know it's agapo or agapo in love
[19:15] brother venom talks about this the
[19:17] difference between that and filio love
[19:19] and if you go to the concordance to
[19:21] strong's concordance and begin to look
[19:23] at this
[19:24] word agape when you look at the word it
[19:27] references you to filio love and in
[19:29] there there's a little write-up it's
[19:31] very unique that it's even in there it's
[19:33] a little write-up from a german scholar
[19:35] that lived right at the turn of the
[19:36] century and and basically what he's
[19:39] describing the difference between agapo
[19:41] love and filio love just like brother
[19:43] branham did only i like the way that
[19:45] it's worded here he says the verb agapen
[19:49] is the love of intelligence reason
[19:52] comprehension coupled with the
[19:54] corresponding purpose
[19:56] i want you to catch that it's much
[19:59] different than the love the emotional
[20:01] love that we've learned to call love
[20:03] what we talk about is love brother venom
[20:05] attaches that to affiliate love which is
[20:07] an emotional type love which is like a
[20:09] friendship love and a family love and a
[20:12] love for individuals but this love is
[20:15] different kind of love than that because
[20:18] that love is based on emotions
[20:21] feelings
[20:23] this love is not based on any emotions
[20:27] the word of god is the love of
[20:28] intelligence reason comprehension
[20:32] coupled with the corresponding purpose
[20:35] in this it is
[20:36] it its content is vastly outranks the
[20:39] other type of love and filian expresses
[20:42] the love of mere personal affection or
[20:44] liking
[20:46] including even the passions where the
[20:47] context requires and no intelligence or
[20:50] high purpose is involved
[20:52] this content places the verb on a low
[20:55] level it could never be said of god that
[20:58] hephilia the sinful world as far as
[21:01] philian is concerned he could only
[21:03] abominate the foul world jesus never
[21:06] asked us to love our enemies in the
[21:07] sense of filian he never himself loved
[21:10] his enemies this way
[21:12] but agape yes with this love did god
[21:14] love the world and we can love our
[21:16] enemies comprehending all that is wrong
[21:19] sanctifying the world converting our
[21:21] enemies
[21:22] compare john 3 16 and every other
[21:24] passage in which either of the verbs is
[21:26] used in this gospel only in a few cases
[21:29] where either type of love would apply
[21:31] either verb might be used but even then
[21:33] the great distinction would remain the
[21:35] two are never equal
[21:38] i really enjoyed that this is what
[21:39] brother benham described so many times
[21:41] he talked about the difference you know
[21:43] even he said
[21:44] filio love
[21:46] amen would cause a man in anger for
[21:49] somebody who violated his wife he'll
[21:50] he'll in turn and go and kill that man
[21:53] that's that's philly and love because
[21:55] it's passion it's love it's feeling amen
[21:58] but he says agapo love will make you
[22:00] pray for him that his soul would be
[22:01] saved
[22:03] it's so different because it's a level
[22:06] i would say agapo love is impossible
[22:08] without revelation because it's a love
[22:10] of intelligence and understanding and it
[22:13] ties in the corresponding purpose that
[22:14] god has a purpose and all of that amen
[22:17] and his love is projected in all of that
[22:20] so it's not and it's a wonderful thing
[22:23] amen that god had agapo love for the
[22:25] children of israel because the bible
[22:27] many times said he was angry with them
[22:30] if he had filio love when he was angry
[22:32] with them there's no way he could
[22:33] continue to work with them amen and
[22:35] continue to protect them amen i'm sure
[22:38] that you know we do things that anger
[22:40] the lord because god can get angry
[22:44] he gets angry with sin he gets angry
[22:46] with these things but i'm so glad god's
[22:48] love is not an emotional love it's a
[22:49] higher love than that amen and it's a
[22:52] love of understanding god has the
[22:53] intelligence the understanding to know
[22:55] his purpose and who is who and what he's
[22:58] doing and the whole plan of god with
[22:59] corresponding purpose and he loves with
[23:02] understanding amen and he's asking us to
[23:04] come to a higher love not just emotional
[23:07] amen and that sometimes you know uh
[23:10] emotional love is a part of it brother
[23:12] branham says if you have a religion
[23:13] without emotion i would bury it it's
[23:15] dead
[23:16] because even agapo love can produce
[23:18] emotion but it's not based on emotion
[23:22] right
[23:23] because god has emotion god expresses
[23:25] emotion in the word but his love towards
[23:27] us is not based on emotion
[23:30] based on a higher order so we don't want
[23:33] to say we don't want to have any emotion
[23:34] that would be a horrible way to serve
[23:36] the lord i love when the presence of the
[23:38] lord sweets in and it begins to draw
[23:40] tears out of my eyes and i love him so
[23:41] much and i feel it amen
[23:44] i love that i love those experiences i
[23:46] never want them to go away amen but even
[23:49] when i'm not feeling that i still love
[23:51] god and he still loves me
[23:53] so we never want to say it's unemotional
[23:56] there better be some emotion amen there
[23:58] better be something because god has
[23:59] emotion he's built us with emotions so
[24:01] that's not what we're talking about but
[24:03] we're going to talk about something
[24:04] that's not based on the emotions because
[24:06] it will fluctuate all the time it's got
[24:08] to be higher than that it's got to be
[24:10] deeper than that it must be stronger
[24:12] than that
[24:14] so god is love
[24:16] amen in perfect love casts out fear so
[24:19] we want to talk about perfect love today
[24:23] amen and and
[24:24] brother venom had some really
[24:26] interesting things to say and and i'd
[24:28] like to say as we begin
[24:30] you know brother brenham was good at
[24:32] telling stories amen he told a lot of
[24:34] stories and he would tie a lot of things
[24:35] into his sermons and he would be
[24:37] preaching away and all of a sudden he
[24:38] would go into a story amen
[24:41] and used to years back when i first come
[24:43] into the message i enjoyed hearing all
[24:45] the stories and then i got to where i
[24:47] wanted to learn the doctrine and so i
[24:49] would be skipping through the stories to
[24:50] get to where he tells the doctor and
[24:53] missing the whole point that brother
[24:55] banner's ministry was a reflection of
[24:56] the son of man
[24:58] and when jesus was here in order to
[25:00] teach his disciples he began telling
[25:02] stories and they're not stories they're
[25:04] parables
[25:05] and brother benham stories are not
[25:07] stories they're parables
[25:09] so if you want to understand what he's
[25:10] preaching you better pay attention to
[25:12] the story not skip through it to try to
[25:14] get the doctrine because the doctrine's
[25:16] in the story
[25:17] amen
[25:19] amen
[25:20] brother branham he begins to address
[25:22] mother's day and he says
[25:24] mother is so great you know the first
[25:26] one that receives you in this life is
[25:29] your mother no one can touch you because
[25:31] you're conceived and she bears you under
[25:33] her heart and she's the first to know
[25:36] you and the first in this life to hold
[25:38] you
[25:39] so so sisters amen when when the new
[25:42] baby comes and wants to get passed
[25:43] around to all the family members just
[25:45] realize that you've had almost 10 months
[25:47] to hold that baby man we want to turn
[25:49] too amen
[25:50] so don't get don't get upset
[25:53] amen and was the first to know you in
[25:56] the first in this life to hold you and
[25:58] when you're born she's one of the first
[26:00] hands that touch you and wipes back the
[26:02] tears of your eyes she is the first one
[26:04] to pat you and to love you and to coo
[26:06] over you in this life is your mother
[26:08] now i think that there is not enough
[26:10] honor that we could give to a mother
[26:13] mother is first with child and she's a
[26:16] great responsibility of what that child
[26:18] would be
[26:19] will be based upon the way that mother
[26:21] starts that child on the path that it
[26:22] must travel mother has the
[26:24] responsibility from god to place that
[26:26] child on the right road and i think
[26:28] that's why mothers has a special little
[26:30] place
[26:32] brother bannon begins to teach us as the
[26:33] bible teaches us that motherhood
[26:36] parenthood together mother and
[26:37] fatherhood is an expression of the
[26:39] nature of god because god is a father
[26:41] amen
[26:43] and and so this this motherhood brother
[26:45] ben begins to tie it in as an expression
[26:48] of god an expression of god's love
[26:50] because even as the bible types it there
[26:52] is no greater bond of human love than
[26:55] that for a mother with her infant
[26:58] and the bible begins to express this and
[27:00] tie this and show that god's love is
[27:02] greater than that and so brother ben
[27:04] begins to use it as a type to begin to
[27:06] show amen the love of god he goes on to
[27:08] say
[27:09] in blind bartimaeus i tell you the
[27:11] thoughts of a good christian mother is a
[27:13] treasure to a human heart that's never
[27:15] forgotten
[27:16] so if you've got a good christian mother
[27:18] it's a treasure
[27:19] that should never be forgotten
[27:21] then he goes on and starts talking about
[27:23] the condition of the world he says the
[27:25] beautiful virtue that god give a woman
[27:27] to be a mother has been marred
[27:30] and i can say it's been destroyed
[27:33] and the culture that we live in today
[27:37] it's been marred and that's the backbone
[27:39] of the nation you break motherhood and
[27:41] you broke the nation right then that's
[27:44] one thing that helps hold it together
[27:46] real genuine parenthood
[27:49] because real genuine parenthood is a
[27:50] reflection of god
[27:52] god is displayed in family
[27:55] god is a father he had a son amen the
[27:57] son is going to have a bride that that
[27:59] bride is supposed to reproduce amen so
[28:01] god and family is reflecting his own
[28:03] plan and his own character and his own
[28:05] nature is is reflected in family life
[28:08] so there's a reflection even in
[28:11] motherhood of the love of god and like i
[28:13] said the one of the strongest bonds on
[28:15] earth is the bond between a mother and
[28:17] her infant
[28:18] and brother branham's just talking about
[28:20] how the the you break motherhood you
[28:22] break the nation and that's what we've
[28:24] seen there's so many excuses for why the
[28:26] country is in the condition that it's in
[28:28] and you watch and there's economic
[28:30] reasons and there's all kinds of
[28:32] political reasons and everybody wants to
[28:34] blame somebody else and the real problem
[28:36] is is the breakdown of the pulpits not
[28:38] to hold the word of god before the
[28:40] people that's what's wrong with the
[28:42] country
[28:43] you can say republican you can say
[28:45] democrat you can say uh you can say
[28:47] white house you can say supreme court
[28:49] you can say whatever you want to say and
[28:52] all of those are just effects of the
[28:54] cause but the cause was leaving the word
[28:56] of god
[28:58] and so that's why i mean right now it
[29:00] doesn't matter who you vote for i know
[29:02] some people still get tied up and
[29:04] republicans are more godly than
[29:05] democrats and blah blah blah it's a
[29:07] bunch of rubbish absolute rubbish
[29:10] because none of them are bringing the
[29:11] word of god back amen and the only hope
[29:13] is the word of god not a political party
[29:16] not an idea not conservativism because
[29:19] conservativism is still devoid of the
[29:21] word
[29:22] but it's the word and when we dropped a
[29:25] men motherhood motherhood was part of
[29:27] the word amen fatherhood was part of the
[29:30] word when they when they when they put
[29:32] the mother into the workforce when they
[29:33] split up the home when they created
[29:35] daycares they began to destroy the word
[29:38] of god
[29:40] and it began to break from there and
[29:41] everywhere else that's not the only
[29:43] thing that broke but so many things
[29:45] broke down because it was the breakdown
[29:47] brother ben instead of pulpits
[29:49] that was the problem
[29:51] so until you get all the pulpits
[29:53] preaching the word again you're not
[29:55] going to vote anything that's going to
[29:57] fix america
[29:59] it's finished it's absolutely the
[30:02] prophet said it's finished it's finished
[30:05] it's finished because they turned their
[30:06] back on the word
[30:08] they rejected the lord
[30:11] and when they rejected the lord and
[30:12] rejected the word then motherhood began
[30:14] broken fatherhood was broken family was
[30:16] broken church began to be broken
[30:18] everything's been broken since then
[30:21] so i thank god that under the word amen
[30:24] but under the word that's been restored
[30:26] it's also restored motherhood it's
[30:28] restored fatherhood it's restored family
[30:30] it's restored relationships it's
[30:32] restored all of these things amen so
[30:34] many people we've talked before they
[30:36] they they've told me in the past when
[30:37] all of our kids were little we would
[30:39] have family members tell us you're so
[30:41] lucky your kids are so well behaved
[30:43] [Music]
[30:45] and i just used to marvel at that well i
[30:48] said well apparently you're a pretty
[30:49] unlucky person
[30:53] you know
[30:56] but it wasn't luck it was the word of
[30:58] god
[30:59] because we didn't know what we were
[31:00] doing we just did what the word said do
[31:02] and it works amen
[31:04] when when the word puts fatherhood in
[31:07] place and motherhood and place and
[31:08] respect between the two and respect to
[31:10] the children children respect to the
[31:12] parents and respect amen
[31:15] in the churches to one another amen you
[31:17] can begin to see that the families that
[31:20] we see they're not a reflection of good
[31:23] carnal teaching they're not a reflection
[31:24] of somebody trying better with a better
[31:26] idea the family life that you see is a
[31:29] reflection of the word of god being
[31:31] exalted to its position
[31:33] and then god is expressing himself
[31:36] through family
[31:39] amen and so brother i'm saying the the
[31:42] breakdown of motherhood and and he's
[31:44] standing in his yard and he is having a
[31:46] conversation about a story that took
[31:49] place in jeffersonville where a young
[31:51] unwed woman became pregnant and she had
[31:53] a baby and she threw the baby in the
[31:55] river to drown the baby to get rid of it
[31:57] and they're having this discussion and
[31:59] while they're having this discussion an
[32:01] old possum comes in the yard
[32:04] don't forget the parable
[32:08] though they're talking about this this
[32:10] this young woman who threw her baby in
[32:12] the river and and they're talking about
[32:14] how the morals is gone and motherhoods
[32:15] are gone and here walks in a possum
[32:18] down the lane
[32:20] what a timely arrival
[32:23] brother ben said just then the milkman
[32:25] come up and he was looking at her he's
[32:26] talking about the possum
[32:28] all of us standing around and a possum
[32:31] and
[32:32] and a kangaroo is the only two animals
[32:34] that have a pocket that carry their
[32:35] young in so the old possum had let down
[32:37] her string that held the pocket together
[32:39] and nine little baby possums naked about
[32:42] that long was crawling on the ground
[32:44] i said look at that now come here leo
[32:46] gene i said there is a real mother's
[32:49] love
[32:50] there's a real really more mother about
[32:53] this old possum than there is about that
[32:54] woman that drowned her baby
[32:57] she doesn't have over 30 minutes long to
[32:59] live and she's willing to give that 30
[33:01] minutes to fight for them babies it's a
[33:03] mother's love that's in her that makes
[33:05] her do that
[33:07] brother bam in other places he tells
[33:08] this story over and over but he says he
[33:11] takes a rake and he he lays it on her
[33:13] and he says many times you know when you
[33:14] go to touch them or get no they'll roll
[33:16] over and play dead amen but this wasn't
[33:18] just a possum by herself she had babies
[33:20] and when that rake touched her she
[33:22] started biting at it and started
[33:23] fighting but we know she was been
[33:25] attacked by something by what brother
[33:27] bam said she was so sick and so weak she
[33:29] was at the point of death and brother
[33:31] ben said couldn't have more than 30
[33:32] minutes to live but she would give the
[33:34] last bit of her strength fighting to
[33:36] protect those babies
[33:38] that's light years ahead of that woman
[33:40] who didn't want to be bothered with a
[33:41] child and threw it in the river
[33:44] and he begins to talk about how how she
[33:47] came to the door because she was a
[33:49] mother
[33:50] she came to the prophet to be prayed for
[33:53] to be healed so that she could raise
[33:54] these babies
[33:56] because she was a mother she drug
[33:58] herself there because she was a mother
[34:00] she was expending her energy because she
[34:02] was a mother she was fighting for the
[34:04] lives of those little naked possums amen
[34:06] something that seemingly is worthless in
[34:09] this society and worthless in the world
[34:11] is demonstrating more love and more
[34:13] motherly love than most of the society
[34:16] in laodicea these
[34:18] days and brother branham is the one
[34:20] who's highlighting this it's not just a
[34:23] possum friends
[34:25] it's a parabolic man this is the kind of
[34:27] love even even an animal can have more
[34:30] love than a human ought to have
[34:34] and we weren't born just to have human
[34:37] love we were born to have the love of
[34:38] god which is so much higher than that
[34:40] lie but man has gone so low amen an
[34:44] animal has to demonstrate the right kind
[34:46] of motherly love because the women
[34:47] aren't doing it
[34:50] that's why we have abortions and birth
[34:52] controls and day cares and all this
[34:54] other stuff because a woman doesn't want
[34:56] to be a mother and doesn't have the
[34:57] right kind of love anymore
[35:00] but this possum was demonstrating it
[35:03] and such a phenomenal thing that it
[35:05] should come up and lay for two days at
[35:07] the prophet's door and brother bannon
[35:08] would eventually reveal to the prophet
[35:10] that she's come like a lady and waited
[35:12] her turn to be prayed for
[35:15] she was more of a lady than most women
[35:17] in the world today
[35:19] and so brother brahm uses this to begin
[35:21] to talk about a mother's love because a
[35:23] mother's love is so strong that even the
[35:26] mother's love in an animal would do
[35:29] something like this
[35:30] let's let's look at something in the
[35:32] bible from first kings let's turn the
[35:33] first kings together
[35:42] first kings chapter 3.
[35:46] the nominal christian world talks about
[35:48] love they have no idea what they're
[35:49] talking about
[35:50] it's all feeling and all emotion
[35:53] amen they they haven't even got to the
[35:56] place of animal love yet
[35:59] not even gone back to basic human love
[36:02] which the bible says they've lost
[36:03] natural affection
[36:06] so when they've lost natural affection
[36:08] they've lost just the basis of natural
[36:10] human love and now an animal is
[36:13] expressing more natural human love than
[36:15] a human they've lost natural affection
[36:18] and they believe they have the love of
[36:19] god and don't even have natural
[36:21] affection
[36:23] we're so far short in the world
[36:25] from where they ought to be first kings
[36:28] chapter 3
[36:29] verse 16.
[36:32] and then came their two women this is
[36:34] coming to solomon this is a story to
[36:36] display the wisdom of solomon then there
[36:38] then came their two women that were
[36:40] harlots unto the king and stood before
[36:42] him
[36:44] and the one woman said my lord i and
[36:46] this woman dwell in one house and i was
[36:48] delivered of a child with her in the
[36:50] house
[36:51] now remember these are harlots so these
[36:54] aren't even legitimately born children
[36:58] i was deliberate of a child with her in
[37:00] the house and it came to pass the third
[37:01] day after that i was delivered that this
[37:04] woman was delivered also when we were
[37:05] together there was no stranger with us
[37:07] in the house save we too in the house
[37:11] and this woman's child died in the night
[37:14] because she overlaid it and she arose at
[37:16] midnight and took my son from beside me
[37:18] while thy handmaid slept and laid it in
[37:21] her bosom and i and laid her dead child
[37:24] in my bosom
[37:25] and when i rose in the morning to give
[37:26] my child suck behold it was dead
[37:29] but when i had considered it in the
[37:31] morning behold it was not my son which i
[37:33] did i did bear
[37:35] and the other woman said nay but the
[37:37] living is my son and the dead is thy son
[37:40] and this said no but the dead is thy son
[37:43] and the living is my son thus they spoke
[37:45] before the king
[37:47] then said the king the one saith this is
[37:49] my son that liveth and thy son is the
[37:51] dead and the others say nay but thy son
[37:53] is the dead and my son is the living and
[37:56] the king said bring me a sword. and they
[37:58] brought a sword before the king and the
[38:00] king said divide the living child in two
[38:03] and give half to the one and half to the
[38:05] other
[38:06] then spake the woman who's the living
[38:08] child was and to the king for her bowels
[38:10] yearned upon her son and she said oh my
[38:13] lord give her the child and in no way
[38:16] slay it but the other said let it be
[38:18] neither mine nor thine but divide it
[38:21] then the king answered and said give her
[38:23] the living child and in know i slay it
[38:26] she is the mother thereof
[38:30] this is this story is he put in here
[38:32] displaying the wisdom of solomon amen we
[38:35] know there's a spiritual application
[38:37] also in a natural application but you
[38:39] can see the natural love of a mother
[38:43] in that these two women were harlots so
[38:46] that these children weren't conceived
[38:47] under good conditions they weren't
[38:48] birthed in the right kind of condition
[38:50] these two women lived alone they were
[38:52] the only ones in the house they had
[38:54] children three days apart and when the
[38:56] one died one pulled a switcheroo but the
[38:58] mother who was the real mother of the
[39:00] living child amen her bowels yearned
[39:02] within her for the living child so that
[39:05] even if she had to lose her right to the
[39:08] child for the child to live she would
[39:10] give up all of her rights
[39:13] you see this is this is this is a
[39:16] mother's love this is natural a natural
[39:18] love of a mother but in one of the
[39:20] strongest loves there is on earth
[39:22] earthly love is this love between a
[39:24] mother and her baby and this woman she
[39:27] pleaded with the king no give her the
[39:29] child
[39:30] give it to her the other woman had no
[39:33] love for the baby because it wasn't hers
[39:35] and she said you can divide it that's
[39:37] fine with me do whatever you have to do
[39:39] but the real mother the one with real
[39:41] love says no i she was willing to
[39:44] sacrifice all her rights for the baby to
[39:46] live
[39:47] she was willing to give up she would
[39:49] she'd be heartbroken no doubt would she
[39:51] shed tears absolutely amen would she
[39:53] feel a loss the rest of her life yes but
[39:56] she was willing to suffer
[39:59] for that baby
[40:00] [Music]
[40:01] she was willing to give up
[40:03] for that child
[40:06] and now we're starting to see what a
[40:08] true love begins to look like because
[40:10] true love is sacrificial love amen
[40:14] and that's what this world is lacking
[40:16] and that's what true mothers can teach
[40:17] us amen i i've marveled watching and
[40:20] watching my wife with the babies and
[40:22] watch how much a human being can
[40:25] sacrifice
[40:26] they can give up their bodies they can
[40:28] give up their health they can give up
[40:29] their comforts they can give up their
[40:31] sleep they can give up so much amen
[40:33] because because the the needs of the
[40:36] child and there's something in a mother
[40:37] by nature amen she can just sacrifice
[40:40] and sacrifice and sacrifice and i am so
[40:43] thankful that god didn't have me carry
[40:45] children and care for them as infants
[40:47] because we would have worked out a plan
[40:48] we would have had a better schedule we
[40:50] would have
[40:53] because i don't know that i'd have been
[40:54] able to come to that level of personal
[40:56] sacrifice
[40:58] but watching it is amazing amen even a
[41:01] child waking up in the night two three
[41:02] four times at night or when a child gets
[41:04] sick no sleep at all you know one two
[41:07] nights and you know
[41:08] and so many times as a father you're
[41:10] willing to help and i'd be willing to
[41:12] help and my wife would wake up and i'd
[41:13] say no i'll go take care of them and as
[41:15] the children got older of course we took
[41:17] turns and we helped but when she knew
[41:19] that the only thing that would comfort
[41:21] that infant was me
[41:23] when she knew that the only thing that
[41:26] will bring calm and peace to that infant
[41:28] the only thing that will really come you
[41:29] can walk the floor with them you can pat
[41:31] their bottom as a father but there's
[41:33] nothing for that newborn baby like a
[41:35] mother
[41:37] and when she would know that she would
[41:39] say no
[41:40] i'm going give up sleep give up health
[41:43] give up everything just for the comfort
[41:45] of a baby
[41:47] i say that's
[41:48] that's a real love
[41:51] it is not even yet to god's love but
[41:52] it's real
[41:54] it's real it's genuine and it's a model
[41:57] for us
[41:59] brother ben tells another story
[42:01] of a young girl who's coming back from
[42:03] college
[42:04] he says some time ago a little girl went
[42:06] off to college and she come back
[42:07] bringing a little girl with her a little
[42:09] feist and when she got back she was
[42:11] getting off the train and her old mother
[42:13] was standing out there and the little
[42:15] girl that she had with her said who is
[42:17] that old miserable looking wretch
[42:20] and the girl was ashamed oh she said i
[42:22] don't know
[42:23] and when she got off the train the
[42:25] little mother run up said darling i'm so
[42:27] glad to see
[42:28] and said and she turned her back
[42:31] and the conductor was standing there he
[42:33] said mary i'm going to ask you a
[42:35] question
[42:36] i said how can you get so indifferent
[42:38] since you've been away to college is
[42:39] that what you learned in your
[42:40] intellectuals
[42:42] and then this is what the prophet said
[42:44] and i'm afraid that's what we've learned
[42:46] in all of our substituting intellectuals
[42:48] instead of love
[42:50] he's talking about the church instead of
[42:52] loving god we wanted to know something
[42:54] amen and have some information and be a
[42:56] stuffed shirt and know a little more
[42:58] than somebody else but missed the main
[43:00] thing which was the love of god
[43:02] he said we can do the same thing
[43:04] substituting intellectuals instead of
[43:06] love
[43:07] he said mary
[43:09] it is true said i'm an old man too i
[43:11] know your mother's ugly today the reason
[43:13] your mother is ugly is one day you were
[43:15] up in an upper room and she was hanging
[43:17] clothes in the backyard
[43:19] said while she was hanging clothes back
[43:20] there fire caught the house and somebody
[43:23] run and told her and you were in a
[43:25] little pinned off you were in a little
[43:26] room pinned off in the blazes everyone
[43:29] hollering stay out stay out but she
[43:31] wouldn't do it
[43:33] she jerked her apron from her and
[43:34] through the flame she went and she
[43:36] grabbed you and wrapped you in her
[43:37] clothing and she come through and she
[43:39] was burnt and scarred and that's what
[43:41] makes her ugly today
[43:43] and the reason you're pretty is because
[43:45] that she's ugly
[43:47] and she became ugly so you could become
[43:49] pretty
[43:50] and you mean to tell me that you'd be
[43:52] ashamed
[43:53] of your own mother
[43:55] brother goes and types that with us what
[43:58] christ has done for us he's taking the
[44:00] story as a parable to show how strong
[44:02] that mother's love is but how strong
[44:04] god's love is that he sacrificed for us
[44:06] he was marred he was disfigured his
[44:08] visage was so that it didn't even appear
[44:10] as a man amen he was so abused when he
[44:12] went to calvary amen he said how could
[44:14] you be ashamed of christ how could you
[44:17] be embarrassed of one that would love
[44:18] you like that and he uses this story of
[44:20] a mother because that mother was willing
[44:23] to sacrifice even her life for that baby
[44:26] she ran back into the blazes everybody
[44:28] trying to grab her everybody trying to
[44:29] stop her amen but there was no thought
[44:32] in her mind of not going after the baby
[44:35] her only thought was getting to the baby
[44:37] and getting it out no thought of her own
[44:39] self no thought of her own protection
[44:41] her own harm she wasn't probably even
[44:43] thinking of how to get in and how to get
[44:44] out she just reacted love was such a
[44:47] strong motivation that this woman could
[44:49] run into a fire amen and with all the
[44:52] potentials for harm and death she could
[44:54] run and save that baby amen what was it
[44:56] it was a sacrificial love amen and it
[44:59] wasn't a put on it wasn't a fake it
[45:01] wasn't a responsibility it was natural
[45:04] amen
[45:05] it just naturally happened that woman
[45:07] that was standing there in solomon's
[45:09] court that day she didn't have to
[45:11] contemplate and meditate there was a
[45:13] natural reaction for her to give up so
[45:15] that that baby could live
[45:18] this woman in the fire there was no you
[45:20] know she didn't have to sit down and
[45:21] ponder it over and weigh the
[45:23] responsibility weigh the consequence and
[45:25] say well you know i am the mother i
[45:27] probably should go
[45:31] it was natural
[45:33] that love could produce that kind of
[45:36] sacrifice
[45:38] that kind of action
[45:40] brother bam said she became ugly that
[45:42] you might become pretty
[45:44] she forfeited her beauty
[45:46] and and brother benoit tells the story
[45:48] in one place he tells the conductor says
[45:50] she was more beautiful far more
[45:52] beautiful than you are now
[45:55] but she gave up all that to preserve
[45:57] your beauty
[45:59] and christ was far more beautiful than
[46:01] we've ever been
[46:03] but whatever beauty we have it's because
[46:05] of his sacrifice
[46:06] [Music]
[46:07] she forfeited her beauty she forfeited
[46:09] everything that she had and she might
[46:11] save you
[46:12] and then you stand and be ashamed of
[46:14] that precious mother
[46:16] i say the same thing about the message
[46:18] about the word of god how could we ever
[46:20] be ashamed of this message how could we
[46:22] ever be ashamed of a prophet how could
[46:23] we be ever be ashamed of what he taught
[46:25] and what he said and what it sounds like
[46:27] how could we ever be ashamed because
[46:29] this message is christ
[46:31] he's the one who bled for us he's the
[46:33] one who died for us and this word amen
[46:35] is a bleeding bloody word to us amen
[46:39] so brother branham is he's tying these
[46:42] things together and he's beginning to
[46:44] show what what natural love will produce
[46:46] amen and when we talk about this kind of
[46:49] love there's no faking to this kind of
[46:52] love it's the reality
[46:54] you can claim to love somebody and
[46:56] really really love them and and really
[46:58] i'm just completely in love with this
[47:00] person i love them so much amen but let
[47:03] them wake you up 15 times in a night
[47:08] and then we'll find out
[47:12] you know
[47:13] have them in some way in danger and need
[47:16] where you really have to give of
[47:17] yourself to go help them amen where you
[47:20] really have to sacrifice something to
[47:21] save them to rescue them to help them
[47:23] out amen and then we'll find out whether
[47:25] we really love or not amen sometimes we
[47:28] haven't even come to the level of a
[47:29] mother's love let alone the love of god
[47:32] we haven't even come to a mother's love
[47:36] and so every mother in here is showing
[47:38] us something to showing us the strength
[47:41] of a bond of love and the amount of
[47:43] sacrifice that can be given from one
[47:45] human being for another because of a
[47:47] mother's love amen and it's one of the
[47:49] stronger the strongest you can get in
[47:51] human love and every mother in here is
[47:54] showing us that whatever this is there
[47:56] should be more from god to us and us to
[47:59] god
[48:00] his love for us is higher than this our
[48:02] love to him should be higher yet amen
[48:06] brother ma'am now we're going to go to
[48:08] another parable
[48:10] he begins to tell a story about his
[48:12] hunting buddy bert how many remember
[48:14] bert
[48:15] he called him snake eyes he said he had
[48:17] lizard-looking eyes
[48:19] he said bert was a good hunter but he
[48:20] was cruel cruel at heart just mean
[48:23] amen but he said you could depend on him
[48:25] he could hunt
[48:26] and then it's funny too that that
[48:28] brother benham should have a hunting
[48:29] buddy bert snake eyes who was cruel
[48:32] because we thought boy we we're not
[48:34] allowed to associate with anybody
[48:38] amen there's so many things we can learn
[48:41] through parables
[48:43] if we'll just
[48:44] listen
[48:47] he said i thought bert how can you do
[48:49] that
[48:51] that real loyal mother how can you do
[48:53] that
[48:54] what was bert doing he had showed
[48:56] brother ben earlier in the day he had
[48:57] made a little whistle that imitated a
[48:59] fawn's bleed
[49:01] it sounded like a fawn in distress
[49:03] and he said he showed brother branham
[49:05] and he showed him he could use that to
[49:06] get a doe to come out in the open and
[49:08] brother bam said oh you wouldn't you
[49:11] wouldn't do a thing like that bert
[49:14] and and now bert they stop they meet up
[49:16] and they stop for lunch and and brother
[49:19] branham brings these bert reach into his
[49:21] coat and he thinks he's going to get his
[49:22] thermos and a sandwich they're going to
[49:24] have hot chocolate and a sandwich but he
[49:26] pulls out this whistle
[49:28] and brother man said no bert you
[49:29] wouldn't do that
[49:31] and he begins to blow on this whistle
[49:33] and begins to imitate a baby deer in
[49:35] distress
[49:36] a fawn in need
[49:39] and this big doe at the end of the
[49:41] meadow she steps out steps out and
[49:43] exposes herself to the hunter and she's
[49:45] stepping forward to look for that fawn
[49:47] that's in trouble she's responding to
[49:49] the call of the fawn and she's putting
[49:51] herself right in harm's way she's coming
[49:53] right into the open she was hidden from
[49:54] sight but she stepped into sight to see
[49:56] if she could save this fawn
[49:58] and this is where brother is saying
[50:00] bert how can you do that
[50:03] that real loyal mother how could you do
[50:05] that listen we're talking about an
[50:07] animal again friends
[50:10] he was a dead shot
[50:12] how can you do it bert i thought oh god
[50:14] don't let him do it
[50:16] i turned my head i couldn't watch it
[50:18] being done
[50:20] that real mother was something that was
[50:22] genuine
[50:23] standing there
[50:25] standing there at her death because
[50:27] there was something inside of her that
[50:28] would even call her to her death yet
[50:31] she'd protect her young
[50:33] she was watching for that baby i turned
[50:35] my head i was listening to hear the gun
[50:37] go off and i watched to the splatter of
[50:39] meat and that deer's heart blowed
[50:41] plumbed through it when the big mushroom
[50:43] bullet would hit it and i waited and i
[50:45] didn't hear nothing and i waited a
[50:47] moment longer i had my back turned i
[50:49] thought what's the matter
[50:51] and when i turned the rifle barrel was
[50:53] going like this
[50:55] later he describes it as shaking
[50:57] he said he threw the gun on the ground
[50:59] turned around grabbed me by the legs he
[51:01] said billy i've had enough of it lead me
[51:03] to that christ who is love
[51:06] if the love of a mother could stand that
[51:08] way in death let me have the love of god
[51:10] when i come to my death he said
[51:13] see
[51:13] it's a display of real love
[51:16] mother of them tells this story over and
[51:18] over and over again amen and why so i
[51:22] mean he put so much emphasis on a deer
[51:24] and a possum and a and on all these
[51:26] things because it's a display of
[51:28] something genuine it was real why would
[51:30] his friend burst see burst saw something
[51:32] that wasn't pretending to be a christian
[51:34] and pretending to love god and
[51:35] pretending to love others he saw
[51:37] something that was absolutely genuine
[51:39] and could not be faked and could not be
[51:41] mimicked
[51:42] and when he saw the genuine he realized
[51:44] the lack that he had in his life and he
[51:46] said i want that kind of love in me and
[51:48] what he needed was a love that was
[51:50] higher than that love but this love was
[51:52] motivating him to a higher one
[51:55] let's look at some scriptures let's look
[51:57] at ephesians chapter 5.
[52:01] i want to read quite a few scriptures
[52:02] here
[52:04] for the next little bit so keep your
[52:06] bibles handy
[52:07] ephesians chapter 5
[52:10] verse 1.
[52:15] he said
[52:16] in ephesians chapter 5 verse 1
[52:19] says be therefore followers of god as
[52:22] dear children
[52:23] and walk in love
[52:25] as christ also has loved us and has
[52:27] given himself for us an offering and a
[52:31] sacrifice to god for a sweet-smelling
[52:33] savor
[52:35] we're going to walk in this love
[52:38] as christ
[52:40] so what kind of love would she walk in
[52:42] the kind of love christ has that caused
[52:45] him to give himself for us
[52:47] so walk in love as christ also has loved
[52:51] us and has given himself for us an
[52:54] offering and a sacrifice to god
[52:57] even this scripture paul's showing us
[52:59] that love true love
[53:02] genuine love god's love is a sacrificial
[53:05] love
[53:06] and every true genuine love that
[53:08] reflects god's love is a sacrificial
[53:11] love
[53:12] it's not a selfish love it's not a
[53:14] self-centered love it's not a
[53:15] self-serving love
[53:18] it's not a love where the person itself
[53:20] is the greatest beneficiary but it's a
[53:21] love where the person is directed to is
[53:24] the greatest beneficiary
[53:26] that is this love that christ had for us
[53:29] and gave himself for us so true love
[53:32] genuine love is sacrificial love
[53:35] he says he goes on to say
[53:38] he said billy he's talking about burke
[53:40] now
[53:41] i've had enough of it lead me to that
[53:43] jesus that you talk about is so real
[53:46] what was it he saw something real he saw
[53:50] something that wasn't put on he saw
[53:52] something that was genuine he saw a
[53:54] mother's love that would stand in the
[53:56] face of death or regardless of what it
[53:58] was he saw something real not a sermon i
[54:01] priest or a song that the church sung
[54:04] listen we can have all kinds of sermons
[54:06] but if it doesn't project the love of
[54:07] god what's the good is it going to do we
[54:10] can sing all kinds of songs but if it's
[54:12] just a put on if it's just if it's just
[54:15] lipstick and mascara once you wash it
[54:17] off you'll find what it really is
[54:19] we can have a whole we can have such a
[54:22] ceremony to the surface that can be so
[54:24] beautiful and the songs can be so we
[54:27] love him and we have a sermon that's so
[54:29] nice but if there's no genuine love
[54:33] it won't work
[54:35] what one bird
[54:37] not a sermon that was preached not a
[54:39] song that was sung in the church but he
[54:41] saw a display of real love
[54:43] let's go to john 3 16.
[54:46] we we probably don't need to read it
[54:47] because we can quote it but i want to
[54:49] look at it in the bible
[54:50] and i only want to read just a portion
[54:52] of it
[54:54] this
[54:56] john 3 16
[54:58] is plastered all over the place
[55:00] in christian graffiti
[55:03] which i don't comprehend
[55:05] sounds like an oxymoron to me
[55:08] so because i want the world to know god
[55:09] loves him i'll break the law which he
[55:11] told me to keep
[55:12] and defile somebody's property which i
[55:14] was told not to do
[55:16] it's amazing but anyways
[55:20] that's zeal without wisdom i think
[55:23] john 3 16
[55:25] for god so loved the world that he gave
[55:28] that's all i want to read
[55:31] for god so loved the world that he gave
[55:34] that's it right there friends
[55:37] so god so loved the world that he gave
[55:40] what was the expression of god's love
[55:42] what he gave
[55:43] and the fact that he gave
[55:45] he didn't demand that the world give to
[55:47] him
[55:49] because he's god right
[55:51] god is an object of worship and and he
[55:54] could demand offerings and he could
[55:56] demand what other gods demand in other
[55:58] religions they demand more service and
[56:00] more offerings and and they demand more
[56:03] and more and more and when they talk
[56:05] about you know the gods being displeased
[56:07] they have to bring more offerings and
[56:08] greater offerings to satisfy the god
[56:10] who's never satisfied he always has a
[56:12] lust for more blood and more offerings
[56:14] and more gold and more this but we have
[56:17] a god amen who wasn't asking you to
[56:19] serve him we have a god who came to
[56:22] serve us
[56:23] he didn't ask you to give first he was
[56:26] the one who was willing to give and he
[56:28] gave most and he gave more
[56:31] for he came down and became flesh
[56:33] himself became a body because he could
[56:35] not ask us to pay the price we were not
[56:38] able to pay the price but because his
[56:40] justice required a price he himself
[56:42] would come become human flesh to suffer
[56:45] real pain amen real agony real rejection
[56:48] real suffering so that he could give
[56:50] amen himself for us so that we could be
[56:54] saved
[56:55] so that we could be redeemed this is
[56:58] love friends
[56:59] for god so loved the world he gave
[57:03] let's turn to first john go back
[57:07] near the back to first john
[57:17] first john chapter 3
[57:22] verse 14.
[57:26] first john 3 14 we know that we have
[57:28] passed from death into life because we
[57:31] love the brethren
[57:33] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[57:34] in death
[57:36] whosoever hated his brother is a
[57:38] murderer and you know
[57:39] and you know that no murderer has
[57:41] eternal life abiding in him
[57:44] he didn't say you that kill your brother
[57:46] is a murderer you that hate your brother
[57:49] is a murderer
[57:51] and no murderer has eternal life abiding
[57:53] in him hereby perceive we the love of
[57:55] god because he laid down his life for us
[57:59] and we ought to lay down our lives
[58:01] for the brethren
[58:03] this
[58:04] john 3 16 god so loved the world that he
[58:06] gave
[58:07] he's asking you to have the same kind of
[58:09] love he had
[58:10] he's asking you to have the same kind of
[58:12] love a mother has for an infant child
[58:14] that you love the world so much that
[58:16] you're willing to give amen give up your
[58:18] reputation for a brother give up your
[58:20] comfort for a brother give up give until
[58:23] it hurts amen give till it's
[58:24] uncomfortable give give and until you're
[58:27] lacking and they're gaining amen because
[58:29] that's the way god gave to us he gave
[58:32] sacrificially he loved sacrificially and
[58:34] when it says we're to love the brethren
[58:36] as he loved us
[58:38] this is not this is not a phrase this is
[58:40] not a saying and this is not lip service
[58:42] but he wants a genuine love for one
[58:44] another because this is his family
[58:48] and love must be sacrificial
[58:51] love
[58:52] must be
[58:53] given
[58:55] now i want to come to another parable
[58:58] one other parable
[59:00] and before i do i just want to note that
[59:03] when i was a boy and even a young man
[59:05] when somebody would start to talk and
[59:06] preach on love it was like check out
[59:08] time for me
[59:10] like love oh my goodness i don't want to
[59:12] talk about love let's talk about slaying
[59:14] the dragon i mean
[59:16] let's talk about uh you know the great
[59:18] mighty battle so samson gideon give me
[59:21] something to go on but don't talk to me
[59:22] about love
[59:24] but that's because i had a worldly
[59:26] understanding of love it was all
[59:27] emotional it was all feel good and
[59:29] syrupy sweet and sticky and tacky and
[59:33] it was the wrong kind of love
[59:36] amen but when you realize that love is
[59:38] strong
[59:40] love is bold
[59:42] love is brave
[59:44] love is enduring amen love is steadfast
[59:47] and unchanging
[59:48] love is just firmer than a rock amen
[59:51] love is stronger than the strongest amen
[59:54] this is a different kind of love we're
[59:55] talking about it's the very mechanism
[59:57] that makes god all that he is it's the
[1:00:00] very mechanism it's the very reason of
[1:00:02] his strength expressed it's a very
[1:00:04] reason of his steadfastness and
[1:00:06] endurance amen it's the very reason of
[1:00:08] his giving is because of islam this is
[1:00:10] not a love that is characterless because
[1:00:13] somebody has stars in their eyes and and
[1:00:15] heart emojis twirling around their head
[1:00:17] and they've lost their mind because they
[1:00:18] see somebody pretty that's not this kind
[1:00:20] of love this is a love that's come to
[1:00:22] its right mind and makes a decision i
[1:00:24] will suffer for that brother i will give
[1:00:27] i will sacrifice i will give all to god
[1:00:29] it's a total it's a love that requires
[1:00:32] strength amen requires boldness requires
[1:00:35] amen endurance requires all the things
[1:00:38] that the character the divine nature
[1:00:40] requires
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:44] so
[1:00:45] when we preach on love
[1:00:47] young guys don't check out amen
[1:00:51] this is real love
[1:00:53] then brother ben he begins to talk and

[1:02:45] and what was what was
[1:02:46] what was grounding a plane a mother's
[1:02:49] love
[1:02:51] a mother who would love this this boy
[1:02:54] loved him so much and he wasn't even a
[1:02:56] boy he was a man amen but she loved him
[1:02:59] so much amen no matter what wrong he had
[1:03:01] done she loved him so much he was
[1:03:03] praying for his salvation so earnestly
[1:03:05] that god would cause a plane and mean a
[1:03:08] storm to come to ground a plane and to
[1:03:11] hold it there and move his prophet amen
[1:03:14] by speaking to him and moving him away
[1:03:16] from the airport until he come across
[1:03:18] the sister um that that was a mother's
[1:03:21] love and god allowed a mother's love to
[1:03:24] move amen the environment to move storms
[1:03:27] to to reroute planes and do all kinds of
[1:03:30] things
[1:03:31] you think of how much money that airline
[1:03:33] lost putting everybody up in a hotel for
[1:03:35] the night
[1:03:36] and god didn't care how much money they
[1:03:38] lost here's a mother who's praying
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:43] it goes to show god god's concern with
[1:03:45] one thing on this earth and that's his
[1:03:47] elect
[1:03:49] he'll move heaven and earth collapse
[1:03:50] kingdoms move economies for his elect
[1:03:53] that's who he's worried about
[1:03:57] brethren goes on to say i've walked into
[1:03:59] king's palaces
[1:04:01] i've been in some of the most lovely
[1:04:02] homes there is in the world but i never
[1:04:04] was any more felt any more welcome than
[1:04:06] i did in that little colored haunt that
[1:04:08] morning i walked in there knowing that
[1:04:10] the god of heaven was with her i didn't
[1:04:12] know what to do
[1:04:14] and he was going
[1:04:15] and he said it's dark it's dark and had
[1:04:18] the quilt in his hand like this
[1:04:20] and she pat him she said mammy's baby
[1:04:24] i thought yes in disgrace nearly 20
[1:04:27] years old i suppose and no matter how
[1:04:29] disgraceful he was how much trouble he'd
[1:04:32] got into he's still mammy's baby
[1:04:35] that's a mother's love
[1:04:37] and if the love of a mother will do that
[1:04:39] what will the love of god do
[1:04:41] she patted him kissed him on the
[1:04:42] forehead
[1:04:44] listen
[1:04:45] you've always been a son of god
[1:04:48] if you ever were a son or daughter of
[1:04:49] god you've always been a son and
[1:04:51] daughter of god but many of us were
[1:04:53] living disgraceful lives amen but it
[1:04:56] never stopped god's love amen it never
[1:04:58] changed god's love we suffered for it
[1:05:00] maybe you're still suffering for the
[1:05:02] disgrace that you lived in the past amen
[1:05:04] but it never changed god's love for you
[1:05:06] he was never willing to not be your
[1:05:08] father because you were in a fallen
[1:05:10] condition he was always your father and
[1:05:12] always loved you through it all just
[1:05:14] like this mother her baby in total
[1:05:16] disgrace amen had shamed her had run out
[1:05:19] on what what she had taught him amen no
[1:05:22] doubt rejected her teaching rejected her
[1:05:24] instructions brought shame to her in a
[1:05:26] reproach to her but it didn't matter
[1:05:28] that was mommy's baby
[1:05:32] amen let's look at let's look at romans
[1:05:34] chapter 5.
[1:05:43] romans chapter 5
[1:05:46] and verse 6.
[1:05:53] romans chapter 5 verse 6
[1:05:56] for when we were without strength in due
[1:05:58] time christ died for the ungodly
[1:06:01] for scarcely for our righteous men will
[1:06:02] one die yet per adventure for a good man
[1:06:05] some would even dare to die
[1:06:07] but god commended his love toward us
[1:06:10] and that while we were yet sinners
[1:06:12] christ died for us
[1:06:15] when we were shameful
[1:06:17] when we were a mockery of even human
[1:06:19] life
[1:06:21] he loved us
[1:06:23] he never gave up on us
[1:06:25] he never quit
[1:06:26] he loved us
[1:06:28] brother branham preaches in the message
[1:06:30] the invasion of the united states and
[1:06:32] you know what the invasion of the united
[1:06:33] states was preached on mother's day
[1:06:36] praise be to god what a mother's day
[1:06:37] message
[1:06:40] he says here the other day i was talking
[1:06:41] to a mother on the telephone and the
[1:06:43] mother said oh brother billy she said my
[1:06:45] poor boy's in trouble
[1:06:47] said oh what what a trouble he's in i
[1:06:50] said yes i know about it sister dear and
[1:06:53] she said he may be wrong i don't know
[1:06:55] said one says this and one says that i
[1:06:57] don't know but so no matter whether he's
[1:06:59] wrong or right i love him but i said
[1:07:02] there you are
[1:07:03] i love him
[1:07:06] he said to his mother said this is the
[1:07:08] boy the young man he said to his mother
[1:07:10] i've been so deceived by this and that
[1:07:12] said mother i believe you're about the
[1:07:13] only sweetheart i really have a woman
[1:07:16] that's true to me and sticks to me
[1:07:18] that's mother's love that's a real
[1:07:20] mother that'll put her arm around her
[1:07:22] baby regardless whether he's right or
[1:07:23] wrong she goes right on to him if a
[1:07:26] mother can think that of her baby how
[1:07:28] much more will god think that
[1:07:30] of his
[1:07:32] it's amazing sometimes that
[1:07:35] we can see
[1:07:36] how much a mother will forgive and cover
[1:07:39] for and to the point where you're like
[1:07:40] would you please stop it
[1:07:42] they're rotten
[1:07:44] the whole world knows they're rotten
[1:07:47] but something about a mother she sees
[1:07:49] something under the rottenness amen
[1:07:52] she remembers that baby and she
[1:07:53] remembers the baby she held and the baby
[1:07:55] she caught on and a mother can't stop
[1:07:57] but believing that there's still
[1:07:58] something down in there there's still
[1:08:00] something that'll come out and the whole
[1:08:02] world can give up but mom's not going to
[1:08:04] give up amen that's why you mothers you
[1:08:06] can you can shake heaven like nobody
[1:08:09] else amen you can knock on heaven's door
[1:08:10] and remind god i'm still waiting on my
[1:08:12] baby amen i'm still waiting god i
[1:08:14] committed him to you and i'm still
[1:08:16] waiting
[1:08:17] because a mother is one person on earth
[1:08:19] who will not give up and god is the
[1:08:21] person in heaven who will not give up
[1:08:23] and those two loves can come together
[1:08:25] and move mountains amen
[1:08:27] don't doubt it amen believe it amen
[1:08:30] don't don't
[1:08:31] god gave you that love for a reason god
[1:08:33] put it in your heart god knit you
[1:08:35] together don't give up on them amen
[1:08:37] never give up on them keep knocking on
[1:08:39] heaven's door and saying god i just want
[1:08:40] to remind you you gave me this baby i
[1:08:43] committed it to you and i believe with
[1:08:44] all my heart you're going to save them
[1:08:46] and i'm standing by them
[1:08:48] until you finish your work
[1:08:51] praise be to god
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:55] brother branham
[1:08:56] or i'm going to read in romans chapter 8
[1:08:58] before i go to the next quote romans
[1:08:59] chapter 8 verse 35.
[1:09:05] romans chapter 8 verse 35
[1:09:08] says who shall separate us from the love
[1:09:10] of christ
[1:09:13] romans 8 35
[1:09:14] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:09:16] christ
[1:09:17] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:09:19] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:09:23] peril or sword
[1:09:24] that is as it is written for thy sake
[1:09:27] we are killed all the day long
[1:09:29] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:09:30] slaughter and they in all these things
[1:09:32] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:09:34] that loved us
[1:09:35] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:09:37] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:09:39] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:09:41] to come nor heights nor depth or any
[1:09:44] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:09:46] us from the love of god which is in
[1:09:48] christ jesus our lord
[1:09:50] you see why brother branham would point
[1:09:52] to a mother's love amen and begin to use
[1:09:54] that mother's love to show us god's love
[1:09:57] because god's love is so much greater
[1:09:59] than a mother's love amen but the
[1:10:00] mother's love is so enduring amen it is
[1:10:04] so steadfast it can continue on in the
[1:10:06] face of every obstacle a mother can
[1:10:09] still love
[1:10:10] i remember standing by my my my father's
[1:10:13] graveside and my dad passed away as a
[1:10:16] young man i believe he was coming to be
[1:10:18] 41 years old
[1:10:19] and we we come to the grave or not to
[1:10:22] the grave to the casket just before they
[1:10:23] closed the casket gave the family the
[1:10:25] final viewing
[1:10:27] and i stood there and we were all just
[1:10:28] saying goodbye and i was 18 years old
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:33] and it come time for my grandma they
[1:10:34] were going to close the casket and my
[1:10:36] grandma's just a little bitty old woman
[1:10:38] my dad was a big man
[1:10:40] and and she laid her head across his
[1:10:43] chest and began to pat his belly and she
[1:10:45] began to weep my baby
[1:10:48] my baby
[1:10:49] my baby
[1:10:51] to a mother that is always her baby
[1:10:54] no matter how old 41 years old no matter
[1:10:58] what happened in between no matter how
[1:11:00] many harsh words were spoken and how
[1:11:02] many misunderstandings and how many
[1:11:04] fallings out in repentances it didn't
[1:11:06] matter that was her baby
[1:11:08] and i remember she said it stuck with me
[1:11:10] she said he always used to love to have
[1:11:12] his belly rubbed like this
[1:11:15] going all the way back to when he see
[1:11:18] only a mother
[1:11:19] can hold on like that
[1:11:22] i shouldn't say that
[1:11:24] on earth
[1:11:25] only a mother could hold on like that
[1:11:28] but no matter how strong that love is
[1:11:30] god's is so much stronger
[1:11:33] so much more enduring so much more
[1:11:35] steadfast so much solid wrong it does
[1:11:38] not change it does not shift it does not
[1:11:41] move with time it does not move with
[1:11:43] emotions it does not move with our
[1:11:45] conduct god's love does not change amen
[1:11:48] you're his son you're always his son or
[1:11:50] daughter you always will be his son or
[1:11:52] daughter
[1:11:53] if god can love us like that how can we
[1:11:55] not
[1:11:56] how can we not give him everything
[1:12:01] brother brahm goes on to say
[1:12:05] he said she raised
[1:12:06] over and wiped the tears off her cheeks
[1:12:08] like that he's back talking about the
[1:12:10] woman with the with the boy who's so
[1:12:12] sick
[1:12:14] she kissed him on the cheek
[1:12:16] no matter if he was in disgrace she said
[1:12:18] mama's baby
[1:12:20] now see no matter what he was it's still
[1:12:23] her baby
[1:12:24] see that's it you think of a mother's
[1:12:26] love now but god said a mother might
[1:12:28] forget her baby but i can't forget you
[1:12:32] your name's engraved on the palms of my
[1:12:34] hands he loves you don't worry if you're
[1:12:36] taking his word just keep on
[1:12:39] let's go read this in isaiah where the
[1:12:40] scripture comes from isaiah 49.
[1:12:54] isaiah
[1:12:55] chapter 49
[1:12:58] verse 15.
[1:13:03] in the book of isaiah
[1:13:05] is where brother branham refers to the
[1:13:07] scripture isaiah 49 and 15.
[1:13:10] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:13:12] that she should not have compassion on
[1:13:14] the son of her womb
[1:13:16] yea they may forget
[1:13:18] yet will i not forget thee
[1:13:21] we've talked and brother benham's shown
[1:13:23] through the parables how strong a
[1:13:25] mother's love is the strongest that
[1:13:26] there is on earth
[1:13:28] but
[1:13:29] god says
[1:13:31] can a woman forget
[1:13:33] her nursing infant can she forget the
[1:13:36] child of her womb
[1:13:37] yay though she could forget
[1:13:40] and even god goes and refers to the
[1:13:42] strongest earthly love because he's
[1:13:43] trying to draw comparison even though
[1:13:46] it's possible she could forget
[1:13:48] it's impossible for me to forget you
[1:13:51] that they they may forget yet will i not
[1:13:54] forget thee behold i have graven thee
[1:13:56] upon the palms of my hands thy walls are
[1:13:59] continually before me
[1:14:02] god says you're permanently
[1:14:05] tied to me and i'm permanently attached
[1:14:08] to you
[1:14:09] brother man goes on to say in elijah in
[1:14:11] the meal offering he said that's a
[1:14:12] mother's a mother's love for her baby
[1:14:15] there's nothing like it only god's love
[1:14:18] a mother may forget her suckling babe
[1:14:20] but never can i forget you your names
[1:14:22] are engraved on the palms of my hand how
[1:14:24] can he forget you i'll never forsake
[1:14:26] thee i'll never leave thee i'll be with
[1:14:28] thee always even to the end of the world
[1:14:31] he goes on the message love to say
[1:14:33] mother may forget her suckling babe but
[1:14:34] never can i forget you your names are
[1:14:36] engraved on the palms of my hands sure
[1:14:39] by a roman spike
[1:14:42] how would his names engrave brother bam
[1:14:44] go through this many times they were
[1:14:45] engraved by the nail prints in his hands
[1:14:47] amen that's how much he loves you amen
[1:14:50] and those nail prints are the engraving
[1:14:52] of you engraved your names are engraved
[1:14:54] in his hands he'll never forget you
[1:14:57] because the lamb was slain before the
[1:14:58] foundation of the world amen before you
[1:15:01] did right or wrong god knew there would
[1:15:02] be a sacrifice given for you he knew he
[1:15:05] would come himself and your your name is
[1:15:08] engraved
[1:15:09] in the nail prince
[1:15:11] in his hand
[1:15:15] let's look at jeremiah 31
[1:15:17] just go over to the next book
[1:15:20] jeremiah chapter 31.
[1:15:29] jeremiah 31
[1:15:32] and 3
[1:15:37] the lord have appeared of old unto me
[1:15:39] saying yea
[1:15:40] i have loved thee with an everlasting
[1:15:43] love
[1:15:44] therefore with loving kindness
[1:15:46] have i drawn thee
[1:15:49] the new testament says no man can come
[1:15:51] to him and come to me jesus said unless
[1:15:52] the father draw him what causes the
[1:15:55] father to draw you because he loves you
[1:15:57] with an everlasting love
[1:15:59] i have i've loved you with an
[1:16:01] everlasting love and in loving kindness
[1:16:03] have i drawn you if the father has drawn
[1:16:05] you it's because he has an everlasting
[1:16:07] love for you and that everlasting love
[1:16:09] will never disappear will never vanish
[1:16:12] away well it doesn't matter how angry
[1:16:14] you make him his love will not change
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:17] you say but i've been so rotten i've
[1:16:19] done so wrong i've made him so angry
[1:16:21] amen his love is above his anger
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:29] brother ben says in the message perfect
[1:16:31] faith
[1:16:32] so that when we were sinners alienated
[1:16:34] without god in the world in the muck of
[1:16:36] the mud as i talked about this morning
[1:16:38] god came to us
[1:16:40] god sought you you never sought god no
[1:16:42] man can come to me except the father
[1:16:44] draws him first and god came down into
[1:16:46] that muck what you were and sought you
[1:16:48] out and brought you out that ought to
[1:16:51] create perfect love
[1:16:53] that ought to create a perfect love look
[1:16:55] what you was look what you are what did
[1:16:58] that somebody that loved you
[1:17:01] you say you know next time somebody says
[1:17:03] you're so blessed you're you're so lucky
[1:17:06] to have a wife that loves you like that
[1:17:08] you're so lucky to have a husband
[1:17:09] that'll care for you you're so lucky to
[1:17:11] have a family like that you're so lucky
[1:17:13] you're so lucky you're so lucky it's not
[1:17:15] luck it's the love of god amen
[1:17:17] he said look at what you want and look
[1:17:19] at what you are
[1:17:21] what did that somebody that loved you it
[1:17:24] wasn't you doing anything it was god's
[1:17:26] love drawing you and pulling you and
[1:17:28] nurturing you and feeding you and
[1:17:30] clothing you in his word and it's god's
[1:17:32] love it's nothing we did all we did was
[1:17:34] surrender to his love it was his
[1:17:36] everlasting love that drawed us
[1:17:40] there's no lucky we didn't get a lucky
[1:17:41] break we didn't have the right
[1:17:43] temperament in the wife and the right
[1:17:44] temperament in the husband i got lucky i
[1:17:46] married a good one you have no idea
[1:17:48] without the love of god that must might
[1:17:50] have been the most vile man or woman you
[1:17:52] would have ever met in your life it's
[1:17:53] not the temperament it's not their
[1:17:55] character and attitude that they were
[1:17:57] born with it is the love of god amen
[1:17:59] that has drawn them and birthed them
[1:18:01] into the kingdom of god it's god's love
[1:18:03] that's produced this
[1:18:06] it's god's love that has produced this
[1:18:08] life it's god's love that has produced
[1:18:10] these families it's god's love that has
[1:18:12] given us the word and set the church in
[1:18:13] order and told us who we are amen and if
[1:18:16] god can love us like that that ought to
[1:18:18] put a perfect love a complete a full
[1:18:21] love in us back to him not a childish
[1:18:23] love not a superficial love but an agape
[1:18:26] love amen not a feeling love where i
[1:18:29] feel good about loving god today and i
[1:18:31] don't feel good about loving god
[1:18:33] tomorrow amen there's got to be a love
[1:18:35] that expresses back to god it
[1:18:38] reciprocates to him then the same
[1:18:40] measure it came to us
[1:18:44] listen we don't live in the day of
[1:18:46] partial
[1:18:48] this is not partial this is not partial
[1:18:50] word this is full word this is not
[1:18:52] partial life this is full life this is
[1:18:54] not partial love express this is the
[1:18:56] measure of full love expressed
[1:18:58] this is not the partial stature of a
[1:19:00] perfect man we've come to the full
[1:19:01] stature of a perfect man that's what's
[1:19:03] called for in this hour the bright
[1:19:05] shining light of the word has been
[1:19:07] restored has come to bring us into full
[1:19:09] expression of the full word amen and
[1:19:12] there's got to be something that's deep
[1:19:14] inside of us amen that's a reciprocating
[1:19:16] love back to god
[1:19:19] and it's not based on self
[1:19:21] it's based on god
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:29] in the message adoption brother branham
[1:19:31] preaches a four-part message on adoption
[1:19:33] in 1960 in the last part he says i said
[1:19:36] oh lord
[1:19:37] that's what i'm here at the church for
[1:19:39] trying to set the church in order when
[1:19:41] he preaches adoption he's trying to set
[1:19:43] the church in order
[1:19:44] telling you brother sister there's only
[1:19:46] one thing that can enter that
[1:19:49] that's perfect love
[1:19:51] he just got done telling him about his
[1:19:52] experience of going beyond the curtain
[1:19:54] of time
[1:19:55] he had gone beyond the curtain of time
[1:19:57] and had a translation experience where
[1:19:59] he could look back and see his body
[1:20:01] laying on the bed but yet he was in
[1:20:03] another place amen not far from where he
[1:20:05] was but another dimension altogether and
[1:20:08] people were running up to him saying my
[1:20:09] precious brother and he was shaking
[1:20:11] their hands and he said they were real
[1:20:12] they were just as real as you and i are
[1:20:14] here today
[1:20:16] you can say well i mean they're real in
[1:20:17] the spirit realm as if the spirit realm
[1:20:19] is fake
[1:20:22] this remember is the negative yes
[1:20:25] that's the pause remember this is the
[1:20:27] vapor the mist that's the reality
[1:20:30] and brother ben said they were real they
[1:20:32] meant this wasn't a vision this wasn't
[1:20:34] amen just a spiritual experience that
[1:20:36] was the reality of what's moving at a
[1:20:38] faster speed
[1:20:41] our eyes are blind to it but it's real
[1:20:44] and he goes beyond the current of time
[1:20:46] and they begin to say my precious
[1:20:47] brother and he has this experience there
[1:20:49] and he has to come back and he comes
[1:20:50] back to tell us about it and he never
[1:20:52] wanted to leave he said do i have to go
[1:20:54] back
[1:20:55] he said no words can describe it it's
[1:20:57] beyond any description and now he comes
[1:21:00] to the end of adoption and he's talking
[1:21:02] about that place
[1:21:04] and he says
[1:21:05] there's only one thing that can enter
[1:21:07] that
[1:21:08] and that's perfect love
[1:21:10] not because you're loyal to the branham
[1:21:12] tabernacle or the methodist church or
[1:21:13] baptist church them is all right you
[1:21:15] should be but old friends
[1:21:18] not because you spoke with tongues dance
[1:21:20] in the spirit because you cast out
[1:21:21] devils or moved mountains with faith
[1:21:23] that's all right for that's all right
[1:21:25] but still unless that real perfect love
[1:21:27] is there
[1:21:29] that was where perfect love was so he's
[1:21:31] talking about that dimension that's
[1:21:33] where perfect love was and that's the
[1:21:35] only thing that'll let you in there
[1:21:38] that's the only thing that can stay
[1:21:39] there it's the only thing there was
[1:21:42] there
[1:21:44] see that's the only thing there was
[1:21:45] there
[1:21:46] is love
[1:21:48] everything was love and everything
[1:21:50] operated by love
[1:21:51] even when we talk about the statue of a
[1:21:53] perfect man we break out the seven
[1:21:54] virtues that are in the in the divine
[1:21:56] nature those seven virtues are all love
[1:21:59] because they all come out of love and
[1:22:01] all of them together make up the
[1:22:02] capstone of love amen it's all an
[1:22:05] expression of god's love everything
[1:22:07] there was love nothing but perfect love
[1:22:09] can enter there nothing about perfect
[1:22:11] love can stay there nothing was there
[1:22:13] but perfect love
[1:22:15] so it behooves us amen to move into
[1:22:17] perfect love
[1:22:20] let's look at matthew 22.
[1:22:32] matthew 22
[1:22:36] and 35.
[1:22:45] matthew 22 and 35
[1:22:48] then one of them which was a lawyer
[1:22:50] asked him questioning ask them a
[1:22:52] question tempting him and saying master
[1:22:55] which is the greatest commandment in the
[1:22:57] law
[1:22:59] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[1:23:01] lord thy god with all thy heart with all
[1:23:03] thy soul with all thy mind this is the
[1:23:06] first and the greatest commandment
[1:23:09] and the second is like unto it thou
[1:23:11] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:23:14] on these two commandments hang all the
[1:23:16] law
[1:23:17] and the prophets
[1:23:21] so what was the word of god
[1:23:23] love
[1:23:26] love
[1:23:27] so what's the greatest commandment of
[1:23:29] all thou shall love the lord thy god
[1:23:31] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:23:34] with all thy mind
[1:23:35] that's the greatest commandment
[1:23:38] what's this it is the second is like
[1:23:39] unto it
[1:23:41] the second commandment is very similar
[1:23:43] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:23:47] on these two commandments hang all the
[1:23:50] law and the prophet now what is he
[1:23:52] saying the entire word of god to that
[1:23:54] date when jesus was standing there there
[1:23:55] was no new testament
[1:23:58] all the word that you've received every
[1:24:00] commandment every order every parable
[1:24:03] every type every story everything you've
[1:24:06] got the all the law and all the prophets
[1:24:09] hang on these two commandments
[1:24:12] if you could get these two you've got
[1:24:14] everything and you don't need anything
[1:24:15] else
[1:24:16] everything the law was trying to teach
[1:24:18] them was how to love one another and how
[1:24:20] to love god every commandment every form
[1:24:22] of worship was trying to get them to
[1:24:24] love and express love to god and love
[1:24:26] one another amen but he said the whole
[1:24:29] law and all the prophets hang on these
[1:24:30] two commandments love the lord thy god
[1:24:32] with all thy heart with all thy mind
[1:24:34] with all thy soul that means with all of
[1:24:36] yourself complete abandonment to self
[1:24:38] 100 love god with everything and the
[1:24:41] second is like that
[1:24:43] love your neighbor
[1:24:44] as yourself
[1:24:48] i say we're still working on that
[1:24:51] but that's the goal that
[1:24:53] that
[1:24:54] that is love expressed
[1:24:57] then he goes back in adoption a little
[1:24:59] bit later he says
[1:25:01] thus saith the lord he says it's strong
[1:25:03] when you listen to the tape thus saith
[1:25:05] the lord it'll take perfect love to put
[1:25:07] you in that place
[1:25:09] for that's all there was there no matter
[1:25:12] how many how much religious
[1:25:14] demonstration how much good deed you've
[1:25:16] done or whatever you've done that won't
[1:25:18] count nothing
[1:25:20] that won't count nothing on that day
[1:25:22] it'll take perfect love so whatever you
[1:25:24] do lay aside everything else until
[1:25:26] you're just so filled with the love of
[1:25:28] god so you can love those who hate you
[1:25:32] so you want to say do i have the love of
[1:25:34] god he gave you a really good quick test
[1:25:36] to find out whether you're full of the
[1:25:38] love of god because until you're just so
[1:25:40] filled with the love of god till you can
[1:25:42] love those who hate you
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] sometimes god will send somebody along
[1:25:49] will hate you for no good reason amen so
[1:25:52] you can just see you know how much love
[1:25:53] you've got this is this is god and we're
[1:25:56] going to do a little test here today
[1:25:58] you know i'm going to send somebody
[1:26:00] along to express road rage somebody amen
[1:26:02] is going to just ball you out at work
[1:26:04] and somebody's going to
[1:26:06] absolutely just despise you and hate you
[1:26:09] and you can feel the hate coming off of
[1:26:10] them as they yell at you for something
[1:26:12] you didn't do as they accuse you of
[1:26:14] something whatever it is i mean you can
[1:26:16] feel the hate coming off you're like why
[1:26:17] did god let this happen to me so you can
[1:26:20] find out if you're in the love of god or
[1:26:21] not
[1:26:23] because until you can love those who
[1:26:25] hate you
[1:26:26] you've got some more growing to do
[1:26:29] that he says it's perfect love is the
[1:26:32] only thing that'll enter in there
[1:26:36] there's an interesting quote out of the
[1:26:38] ephesian church agent i really want us
[1:26:40] to think about this for a minute
[1:26:43] he says
[1:26:44] ephesus means the very name ephesus
[1:26:46] means let go relax backsliding slidden
[1:26:50] called by god the backslidden church
[1:26:53] god acknowledged first their works their
[1:26:55] labor their patience god rebuked their
[1:26:57] living leaving their first love for
[1:27:00] backsliding and for no longer bearing
[1:27:02] light
[1:27:03] ephesus was not a deceived church
[1:27:06] now i really want you to catch this
[1:27:09] right now
[1:27:10] ephesus had the original word
[1:27:13] do you believe that
[1:27:14] the apostle paul was a church age
[1:27:16] messenger they had the original word he
[1:27:19] says
[1:27:20] ephesus was not a deceived church
[1:27:23] that was not the problem
[1:27:25] and i can say by the grace of god by the
[1:27:27] message of the hour that this bride this
[1:27:29] message is not a deceived church
[1:27:32] so we can put ourselves in the same
[1:27:34] place
[1:27:35] because we've been taken back to the
[1:27:36] faith of the fathers
[1:27:37] so now ephesus was not a deceived church
[1:27:40] so i want you to hear what's said next
[1:27:41] because it's so important to realize
[1:27:43] we've received the word that removes
[1:27:46] deception so we're no longer a deceived
[1:27:48] people
[1:27:49] ephesus was not a deceived church
[1:27:52] it failed itself by not continuing in
[1:27:55] perfect love
[1:27:58] it didn't fail by deception
[1:28:01] it failed by not continuing perfect love
[1:28:04] and we've been given the message to pull
[1:28:06] back deception
[1:28:08] but we can still fail
[1:28:10] if we don't continue in perfect love
[1:28:13] now listen what he says next
[1:28:15] summary of ephesus he's going to start
[1:28:17] the summary
[1:28:19] fruits without love led to apostasy
[1:28:24] i'm going to read that again so it can
[1:28:26] soak in real deep
[1:28:28] fruits
[1:28:29] that means manifestations
[1:28:32] healings
[1:28:33] honesty
[1:28:35] family life
[1:28:36] fruits
[1:28:38] fruits of christianity
[1:28:40] fruits of clean living fruits of the
[1:28:42] word uh healings prophecies
[1:28:45] fruits
[1:28:46] fruits without love
[1:28:49] led to apostasy
[1:28:53] this wasn't a deceived church we're not
[1:28:56] a deceived people
[1:28:58] but that word has got to bring a divine
[1:29:01] love
[1:29:02] that word has got to bring us to a
[1:29:04] perfect love because that's the only
[1:29:06] thing that'll enter in there and we can
[1:29:08] even have fruits but fruits without love
[1:29:10] will once again lead to apostasy
[1:29:13] we see so much emphasis sometimes placed
[1:29:16] on fruits amen we fruits of this and
[1:29:18] fruits of that there should be fruits
[1:29:20] naturally there are fruits fruits come
[1:29:22] from the word of god when the word is
[1:29:24] planted amen it brings forth fruit but
[1:29:26] we can emphasize fruit and still hate
[1:29:28] our brother and still speak evil of
[1:29:31] another one or somebody who believes a
[1:29:32] little different and we call them a name
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:38] fruits without love
[1:29:41] led to apostasy
[1:29:43] i say god
[1:29:44] help these fruits be with love
[1:29:48] above all let's get to the capstone
[1:29:50] friends above all let's not hang up
[1:29:52] somewhere in the journey we've got to go
[1:29:54] to brotherly love and when we hit
[1:29:56] brotherly love it brings the capstone
[1:29:58] into place amen because if you love your
[1:30:00] brother you can love god amen if you
[1:30:02] love god you've not seen how can you
[1:30:03] hate your brother who you have seen amen
[1:30:05] we've we cannot have fruits without love
[1:30:08] that led to apostasy
[1:30:10] but we must have fruits with the love of
[1:30:13] god and we'll want that bring that'll
[1:30:15] bring a translation amen a resurrection
[1:30:17] a new body because the only thing that
[1:30:19] could move there amen is perfect love
[1:30:23] i say god help us not to repeat what the
[1:30:25] ephesians repeated
[1:30:27] but thank god there's a prophecy this
[1:30:29] bride won't fail
[1:30:32] she's predestinated not to
[1:30:35] this is the capstone age
[1:30:37] what does the capstone age mean
[1:30:40] in many ways we can mistake the capstone
[1:30:42] age to mean that this is the age that we
[1:30:44] get all the
[1:30:46] information and that's true
[1:30:49] the full word's been restored but
[1:30:51] brother banner said the capstone was
[1:30:53] love
[1:30:54] this is the age of perfect love
[1:30:57] moving beyond the trivial
[1:31:00] into the reality let's look together
[1:31:02] again at first corinthians 13.
[1:31:05] i want to read this with this
[1:31:06] understanding now in our minds
[1:31:10] first corinthians 13.
[1:31:20] first corinthians 13 chapter 1
[1:31:27] though i speak with the tongue of men
[1:31:29] and angels and have not love
[1:31:32] i'm become a sounding brass or a
[1:31:34] tinkling symbol
[1:31:36] i want you to just we're going to catch
[1:31:38] this a little bit slower than we
[1:31:39] normally read it
[1:31:41] you can speak with tongues of men and of
[1:31:44] angels
[1:31:45] it's a heavenly language
[1:31:48] and i have not charity which is agape
[1:31:51] love
[1:31:52] i am become a sounding brass or a
[1:31:54] templing tinkling symbol
[1:31:56] i am now just a noisemaker
[1:32:00] undiscernable noise
[1:32:03] that doesn't produce anything
[1:32:06] and if we meet somebody who can speak
[1:32:08] with the tongue of men and angels we
[1:32:10] think there's something but if there's
[1:32:12] no love there fruits without love
[1:32:15] brought apostasy
[1:32:18] it goes on and says i am become a
[1:32:19] sounding brass or tinkling symbol and
[1:32:21] though i have the gift of prophecy and
[1:32:23] understand all
[1:32:25] mysteries
[1:32:27] listen friend
[1:32:28] if you meet somebody with the gift of
[1:32:30] prophecy and understands all mysteries i
[1:32:32] mean that's that's to me is a great
[1:32:34] person
[1:32:36] but if that is devoid of love
[1:32:38] it's going to bring apostasy
[1:32:42] though i give the gifts of prophecy and
[1:32:43] understand all mysteries and all
[1:32:45] knowledge
[1:32:46] and though i have all faith listen to
[1:32:48] what paul's saying
[1:32:50] i understand all mysteries i have all
[1:32:52] knowledge and i have all faith
[1:32:54] so that i could remove mountains and
[1:32:56] have not charity i am nothing listen if
[1:32:59] there was a pulpit ministry like this
[1:33:03] that had a prophecy
[1:33:05] knew all mysteries had all knowledge was
[1:33:08] full of faith that it could remove a
[1:33:10] mountain and cast it aside i'm telling
[1:33:12] you it would sweep the world into its
[1:33:14] arms but if it had not love it is
[1:33:17] nothing
[1:33:19] and the world would think it was
[1:33:21] everything the greatest ministry that's
[1:33:23] ever at the earth if that ministry with
[1:33:25] the greatest manifestations ever
[1:33:27] displayed on earth came without love it
[1:33:29] would bring apostasy
[1:33:32] it would be
[1:33:33] nothing
[1:33:35] and though i bestow all my goods now
[1:33:37] he's going to works
[1:33:39] he goes from gifts to works
[1:33:42] and though i would bestow all my goods
[1:33:44] to feed the poor and though i give my
[1:33:46] body to be burned
[1:33:48] and have not charity
[1:33:50] it profits me
[1:33:52] nothing
[1:33:53] that means you gave your whole self
[1:33:56] you gave all of your goods and gave your
[1:33:58] body to be burned what else do you have
[1:34:00] if you give away everything you own and
[1:34:02] give yourself to be burned you've given
[1:34:04] away everything naturally
[1:34:06] but if you do all of that which is the
[1:34:08] maximum level of personal sacrifice
[1:34:12] if you do all that and don't have agape
[1:34:15] love
[1:34:16] it profits you
[1:34:18] nothing
[1:34:21] fruits without love
[1:34:23] led to apostasy
[1:34:26] verse 4 charity now we're going to learn
[1:34:29] about charity what charity is what love
[1:34:32] is
[1:34:33] charity suffereth long
[1:34:36] and is kind
[1:34:38] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:34:40] itself is not puffed up does not behave
[1:34:43] itself unseemly seeketh not her own
[1:34:46] is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:34:49] listen this is absolutely contrary to
[1:34:52] our culture
[1:34:54] this description is the opposite of
[1:34:56] laodicea
[1:34:58] let's read it again suffer is long
[1:35:01] nobody suffers
[1:35:04] is kind
[1:35:05] i mean that's very on a much limited
[1:35:07] basis
[1:35:10] anybody working customer service
[1:35:15] the world has no love of god
[1:35:18] it's moving all into the believers
[1:35:22] envious not is not jealous
[1:35:25] wanteth not itself it does not talk and
[1:35:27] boast about itself
[1:35:30] is not puffed up does not have an
[1:35:31] inflated estimation of itself
[1:35:35] does not behave itself unseemly or
[1:35:38] inappropriate
[1:35:39] seeketh not her own i love that they
[1:35:42] begin to speak paul begins to speak of
[1:35:44] charity in the feminine now
[1:35:46] because the final expression of this
[1:35:48] love is going to be in the bride
[1:35:51] seeketh not her own
[1:35:54] is not easily provoked
[1:35:56] thinketh no evil
[1:35:58] i wonder why sometimes when you talk to
[1:36:00] believers they're always suspicious
[1:36:02] about every other believer
[1:36:05] oh you know
[1:36:07] i heard
[1:36:08] you know they say i love when they say
[1:36:10] you know they say it's like who says
[1:36:14] who's this mysterious day
[1:36:16] that you all we always get our
[1:36:18] information from you know they said
[1:36:20] about that church you know they said
[1:36:21] about that for you and you know they
[1:36:22] said well let's reveal that they
[1:36:26] pull the wizard of oz out from behind
[1:36:28] the curtain and let's talk to him and
[1:36:29] find out what they really know
[1:36:31] the mysterious day i'll give you his
[1:36:33] name it's the devil
[1:36:36] trying to sword disco to morning brother
[1:36:38] think of no evil don't you dare think
[1:36:40] evil when you hear it of another brother
[1:36:42] you think the best until that thing's
[1:36:44] been confirmed and when it's confirmed
[1:36:45] your heart will go to your brother not
[1:36:47] condemnation and not criticism
[1:36:49] that's what love does
[1:36:51] think of no evil rejoice is not an
[1:36:54] iniquity
[1:36:56] it's not happy when somebody falls
[1:37:00] it's not happening as some some other
[1:37:02] wrong
[1:37:04] but rejoiceth in the truth
[1:37:07] beareth all things
[1:37:10] that means supports our covers for
[1:37:12] everything we'll just cover for
[1:37:13] everybody will support everybody beareth
[1:37:16] all things
[1:37:17] believeth all things
[1:37:19] hopeth all things
[1:37:20] endureth all things remember patience
[1:37:24] and the statute of a perfect man
[1:37:27] charity never faileth
[1:37:29] well praise god i've been looking all my
[1:37:31] life for something that will never fall
[1:37:34] will never fail
[1:37:36] everything i've ever experienced in my
[1:37:37] life has a failure somewhere
[1:37:40] but charity
[1:37:41] never faileth
[1:37:44] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:37:46] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:37:48] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:37:51] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:37:53] we prophesy in part but when that which
[1:37:56] is perfect has come then that which is
[1:37:57] in part shall be done away
[1:38:00] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:38:02] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:38:05] child
[1:38:06] all of this is about growing up to
[1:38:07] adoption
[1:38:09] but when i became a man i put away
[1:38:11] childish things for now we see through a
[1:38:13] glass darkly but then face to face
[1:38:16] now i know in part but then shall i know
[1:38:18] even as also i am known
[1:38:21] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[1:38:24] three
[1:38:25] but the greatest of these
[1:38:27] is charity
[1:38:30] so many things we may have sought after
[1:38:32] in our christian life
[1:38:34] so many things we may have wanted to
[1:38:36] attain i want i want that level of
[1:38:38] spirituality i want that gift if i could
[1:38:41] only sing like that preach like that
[1:38:43] live like that do like that but the
[1:38:45] greatest of it all friends is charity
[1:38:48] if you can have the love of god
[1:38:50] reflecting back the love that god
[1:38:52] reflected to us if that love of god is
[1:38:54] in us and it's taking over our lives
[1:38:56] that's the greatest thing that we can
[1:38:57] have
[1:38:59] faith worketh by this love
[1:39:02] everything is based on love and the
[1:39:04] greatest of it all is love that's why
[1:39:06] brother branham says it's the capstone
[1:39:08] let's look real quick at second timothy
[1:39:10] because i want to look at the opposite
[1:39:12] now
[1:39:16] i love it when the word of god just
[1:39:18] begins to identify
[1:39:20] when you don't have to do a lot of
[1:39:22] preaching and point out a lot of
[1:39:23] examples because the bible does such a
[1:39:25] thorough job your mind just starts to
[1:39:27] connect the dots
[1:39:29] ii thessalonians chapter 3
[1:39:31] verse 1.
[1:39:35] this know also that in the last days
[1:39:38] perilous times shall come are we in the
[1:39:40] last days
[1:39:42] so this is the last day's description
[1:39:44] i'm going to read
[1:39:46] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:39:49] selves
[1:39:51] remember love seeketh not her own
[1:39:55] right
[1:39:56] it's always seeking the good of somebody
[1:39:58] else
[1:39:59] but the the contrary attitude and the
[1:40:02] end time for men shall be lovers of
[1:40:04] their own selves
[1:40:07] covetous
[1:40:08] boasters remember love doesn't vaughn
[1:40:10] itself and doesn't envy
[1:40:13] these two descriptions are polar
[1:40:16] opposite one is a perfect description of
[1:40:18] laodicea and the other is a perfect
[1:40:20] description of god himself
[1:40:24] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:40:27] disobedient to parents
[1:40:29] unthankful
[1:40:31] unholy
[1:40:32] without
[1:40:34] natural affection
[1:40:37] animals are loving more than humans are
[1:40:39] now
[1:40:41] truth breakers false accusers
[1:40:44] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:40:48] that are good
[1:40:49] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[1:40:52] pleasures more than lovers of god
[1:40:55] having a form of godliness these are
[1:40:58] christians
[1:41:01] they have this group has a form of
[1:41:04] godliness
[1:41:05] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:41:08] the power thereof from such turn away
[1:41:12] i said god
[1:41:14] make me whatever first corinthians 13 is
[1:41:17] make me that
[1:41:20] brother says in the message hear ye him
[1:41:22] and we'll wrap up with these few
[1:41:24] thoughts
[1:41:25] may god grant to you phoenix people here
[1:41:27] is my prayer
[1:41:29] that the loyalty of christ will be in
[1:41:30] your heart born in there by a nature of
[1:41:33] the holy spirit
[1:41:35] that will make you hunger for god and
[1:41:36] stand just as loyal for god and for his
[1:41:38] word as the loyalty of a motherhood
[1:41:41] stood in that
[1:41:42] stood in that old fawn that old doe that
[1:41:44] day for her farm brother branham is now
[1:41:47] i'm coming back to the story of the
[1:41:49] mother deer that stood out there at the
[1:41:51] distress call for her baby gave her life
[1:41:54] and was willing to be true amen and give
[1:41:57] out out of a love of an animal a
[1:41:59] mother's love expressed to give of her
[1:42:02] life to sacrifice for this fawn
[1:42:04] and now
[1:42:05] uh brother branham's going to try he's
[1:42:07] taking this story now and he's telling
[1:42:10] us that we should have the same kind of
[1:42:13] love for god
[1:42:14] that this mother expressed for that fawn
[1:42:17] now it's not about god's love for us
[1:42:19] brother brenham now is going to use the
[1:42:21] same parable to talk about the kind of
[1:42:23] love that we should have to god
[1:42:26] he goes on and says make me a christian
[1:42:29] make me a born make me born a christian
[1:42:33] like that deer
[1:42:35] what was that dear she was born a mother
[1:42:38] she was born to be a mother come be born
[1:42:41] to be a christian come on you'll have
[1:42:43] the same love of god more so than that
[1:42:45] deer had for her fawn
[1:42:48] that deer was not putting on that deer
[1:42:50] was born that way and by nature was that
[1:42:53] way and what the deer did the deer
[1:42:55] reacted in and by nature amen the mother
[1:42:58] running into a fire reacted by nature
[1:43:00] the the mother that was standing before
[1:43:02] solomon's throne reacted by nature this
[1:43:05] is not a put on amen we don't preach
[1:43:07] this kind of love so that you'll go home
[1:43:08] and make a list of things that you
[1:43:10] should do better and remember to say
[1:43:11] nice things about a brother and so that
[1:43:13] we'll dig in and say god i need more of
[1:43:16] you because this has to come by nature
[1:43:18] amen it's got to be a natural response
[1:43:21] it's got to be a natural outcome of the
[1:43:22] new birth
[1:43:24] amen
[1:43:25] there's not enough things happen too
[1:43:27] fast amen we don't have enough
[1:43:28] self-control amen to mimic this kind of
[1:43:31] life somewhere it's going to break down
[1:43:33] what we need is it for it to be birthed
[1:43:35] in us and grown into its full measure
[1:43:40] in romans 5 5 it says and the hope
[1:43:42] maketh not ashamed
[1:43:44] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:43:46] in our hearts by the holy ghost shed
[1:43:49] abroad means poured out the the because
[1:43:52] the the love of god is
[1:43:54] poured out shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:43:56] the holy ghost which is given to us how
[1:43:59] do i get this love by the holy ghost by
[1:44:02] the new birth amen birthing in me that
[1:44:05] nature growing me into the full stature
[1:44:08] amen of the life of jesus christ to
[1:44:10] display this kind of love on this earth
[1:44:13] and the message why some people can't
[1:44:16] keep the victory from 57 brother branham
[1:44:18] said now while you're thinking it over
[1:44:20] do you really want the real love of god
[1:44:22] in your heart
[1:44:24] and you haven't got it
[1:44:26] now be honest with god
[1:44:28] and as god's servant i bring you in
[1:44:30] jesus christ's name in the presence of
[1:44:32] almighty god and if there's one speck in
[1:44:35] you that's really sincere i pray god
[1:44:38] will bring it out this afternoon
[1:44:40] do you really know that you're short of
[1:44:42] that experience
[1:44:43] would you raise your hand to god and say
[1:44:45] god in christ's name give me that in my
[1:44:48] heart
[1:44:49] god bless you that's wonderful all just
[1:44:51] all over everywhere
[1:44:53] i want the christian love to display
[1:44:55] like that deer had the mother's love to
[1:44:57] display
[1:44:58] i want my christian love to be displayed
[1:45:00] in such a way that'll win others not my
[1:45:03] emotions but my christian love
[1:45:06] how
[1:45:07] we're going to win others
[1:45:09] when bert saw
[1:45:11] bert was a wicked man
[1:45:13] and he said he had a heart of stone he
[1:45:16] was cruel hearted i think is what he
[1:45:17] said
[1:45:18] when bert saw in an animal
[1:45:22] genuine love
[1:45:23] on an animal level
[1:45:26] it did something inside of him
[1:45:28] it began to break that old stony heart
[1:45:30] when he saw genuine love even on an
[1:45:33] animal level
[1:45:35] it began to break him down
[1:45:37] what if there's a people on the earth
[1:45:39] that can display genuine love but not on
[1:45:42] an animal level and not on a human level
[1:45:44] and not even on a mother's level
[1:45:47] but on the level that god loved us
[1:45:50] that can love one another with the same
[1:45:52] kind of love that can love enemies amen
[1:45:54] that can love their neighbor as
[1:45:56] themselves that can love god with their
[1:45:58] heart with all their mind with all their
[1:45:59] soul with all their strength with
[1:46:01] everything amen i believe it'll take an
[1:46:04] effect and break stony hearts amen what
[1:46:06] the world is they don't need rhetoric
[1:46:08] the world doesn't need rhetoric they
[1:46:09] don't need catch phrases amen they don't
[1:46:11] need programs they don't need fans they
[1:46:13] need reality amen what this world needs
[1:46:15] is a reality because nobody loves
[1:46:18] anybody anymore and when they come in
[1:46:20] contact with somebody amen sometimes
[1:46:22] i've had people say to me are you for
[1:46:24] real
[1:46:26] i said i think so
[1:46:29] i don't think i'm a hologram i mean i
[1:46:31] think that
[1:46:32] because some people just they don't
[1:46:34] understand that
[1:46:36] it doesn't make sense it's contrary to
[1:46:38] everything they see but i think that's
[1:46:40] what the bride is supposed to be at the
[1:46:42] end time she's supposed to be a display
[1:46:44] to this world of something different
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:48] and if you ever talk about god making it
[1:46:50] easy for us
[1:46:51] you know how he says you know he can
[1:46:53] never display white unless it's against
[1:46:55] the backdrop of black and the contrast
[1:46:57] amen brings the display of white well
[1:46:59] god could have never allowed the canvas
[1:47:01] to get any blacker
[1:47:04] so that our lives we don't have to
[1:47:06] scream and shout we don't have to stand
[1:47:07] up and say i have the love of god in me
[1:47:10] you just live the way god calls you to
[1:47:12] live and react the way christ would
[1:47:14] react and live from the new birth and
[1:47:16] live the divine nature which the promise
[1:47:19] has made you a partaker of amen and
[1:47:21] people will know this is weird this is
[1:47:23] different this is odd they'll have all
[1:47:25] kinds of names for it they said man
[1:47:26] you're not even for real and once they
[1:47:28] realize you're for real they're going to
[1:47:30] realize there's nothing like this on the
[1:47:32] face of this earth
[1:47:37] that's what real love will produce
[1:47:41] real love
[1:47:42] in all of these stories
[1:47:45] parables
[1:47:47] that brother branham's using
[1:47:48] true love is expressed in hardship
[1:47:52] crisis and adversity
[1:47:56] amen
[1:47:57] i mean it's not loving your neighbor
[1:47:59] when your neighbor you know brought you
[1:48:00] over a plate of cookies for christmas
[1:48:02] and say oh god bless you i love you
[1:48:05] but the true love is expressed
[1:48:08] when when there's contention
[1:48:10] strife crisis
[1:48:12] difficulty
[1:48:14] when the the true love that was
[1:48:16] expressed and the mother dear was at a
[1:48:18] time of crisis the true love that was
[1:48:20] expressed by one of the harlots before
[1:48:22] king solomon's throne was it was a time
[1:48:24] of desperation amen the the the true
[1:48:27] love that was expressed by the mother
[1:48:28] who ran into the fire what is a time of
[1:48:31] great need amen the true love that was
[1:48:33] expressed and the mother who would pat
[1:48:35] her 20 year old son and say mama's baby
[1:48:37] no matter how disgraceful he had lived
[1:48:40] amen that was a time when he needed
[1:48:42] enduring love amen a steadfast love all
[1:48:45] of these loves and all of these parables
[1:48:47] were expressed in the face of adversity
[1:48:49] and need and distress amen and conflict
[1:48:52] and that's where the love of god is
[1:48:54] expressed and that's why our lives are
[1:48:56] not a cake walking and that's why bad
[1:48:58] things still happen and difficulties
[1:49:00] come because it's an opportunity to
[1:49:02] display to this world a life that
[1:49:04] they've never seen anywhere before
[1:49:06] when we listen to these tapes amen and
[1:49:08] you hear about somebody stealing brother
[1:49:10] branham's tent
[1:49:13] you hear about them rejecting him and
[1:49:15] the wives putting pressure on their
[1:49:17] husbands and not have brother branham
[1:49:19] invited anymore to the businessman
[1:49:21] fellowship when you know to hear the
[1:49:22] story where brother ban i'm standing at
[1:49:24] the door getting ready to come in amen
[1:49:26] to preach and they announced that he
[1:49:28] left because his brother was sick
[1:49:31] when you hear how they stole his
[1:49:33] magazine
[1:49:36] when you hear of all these stories
[1:49:38] when you listen to them
[1:49:41] you're not like brother branham you
[1:49:43] should have
[1:49:45] you say that was god in that man
[1:49:48] and it gives you more confidence than
[1:49:50] ever in what that man says
[1:49:53] you believe him
[1:49:54] because the life that was displayed
[1:49:58] when he would commit an error when he
[1:50:00] would make a mistake in sin he would go
[1:50:02] and make it right and publicly confess
[1:50:04] it amen and in the love that he had for
[1:50:06] god that he would make it right not
[1:50:08] cover it over but he loved god so much
[1:50:10] that he would make that thing right and
[1:50:12] then apologize to his wife and apologize
[1:50:14] to the lawyer and do all of those things
[1:50:16] you would look at that and say i have
[1:50:18] more confidence in him than i've ever
[1:50:19] had that's god in that man that's not a
[1:50:22] human being that's beyond human being
[1:50:25] i tell your friends that that wave chief
[1:50:27] wasn't waved when he picked up that
[1:50:29] vessel and showed us the word in
[1:50:30] maturity wasn't waves so we could say
[1:50:33] brother branham was a great man amen but
[1:50:35] we could understand that the love that
[1:50:36] was expressed in that human being can
[1:50:38] express and be expressed in this human
[1:50:40] being all it needs is somebody to love
[1:50:42] god the way that mother dear love that
[1:50:45] baby that will step out amen and stand
[1:50:48] for god that'll step out and take the
[1:50:50] criticism that will take the shot amen
[1:50:52] that will run into the fire amen that
[1:50:54] will give up their selves that will
[1:50:56] sacrifice their rights amen it's that
[1:50:58] kind of love that will display the love
[1:51:00] of god in this world
[1:51:02] a sacrificial love not just god's
[1:51:05] sacrifice he's already sacrificed now
[1:51:07] god amen he's done his part now it's our
[1:51:10] part to display the love of god not the
[1:51:13] love of chad who loves god but the love
[1:51:15] of god who's been birthed in chad
[1:51:18] and the love of god will love him back
[1:51:21] the same way the love of god love the
[1:51:23] god in me the god in me will love the
[1:51:26] god
[1:51:29] my father the same way
[1:51:32] not our love it's his love
[1:51:36] all he needs is somebody who will
[1:51:38] sacrifice
[1:51:40] somebody who will surrender somebody who
[1:51:43] will play the part amen of the mother
[1:51:46] with the with the baby the mother and
[1:51:48] the fire the mother dear and the face of
[1:51:52] danger amen the mother who will cover
[1:51:54] for the sins of her baby
[1:51:57] who was 20 years old
[1:52:00] god needs somebody to love him back that
[1:52:02] way
[1:52:04] and the question is
[1:52:06] who's going to do it
[1:52:08] i say god let it be me
[1:52:10] not in my strength i can't do it but i
[1:52:12] give you every i give you my heart i
[1:52:14] give you my soul i give you my mind i
[1:52:16] give you everything let that love flow
[1:52:19] through me amen i could move mountains
[1:52:21] with faith i could understand all
[1:52:23] mysteries i could have all knowledge i i
[1:52:25] could have prophecies and tongues and
[1:52:28] speak the tongues of angels but if i
[1:52:30] don't have love it all amounts to
[1:52:32] nothing
[1:52:34] brother benham said if i could have any
[1:52:36] gift
[1:52:38] of all the gifts
[1:52:39] if i could pick anything anything that
[1:52:42] you could want you could you could have
[1:52:44] i mean you could have the power of the
[1:52:46] spoken word 24 7.
[1:52:50] you could take any gift
[1:52:52] he said i would take love
[1:52:54] love over it all because they all
[1:52:56] operate by love they all operate in
[1:52:58] accordance to god's love
[1:53:00] god
[1:53:02] is love
[1:53:03] the capstone of our journey to adoption
[1:53:06] is his love
[1:53:07] we were birthed to express that love
[1:53:10] we're here as agents of his love not a
[1:53:12] wimpy weak love not a sissified feeling
[1:53:15] love but a real dedicated sincere
[1:53:19] reality of a love
[1:53:22] that only the redeemed the elect of this
[1:53:24] world
[1:53:25] is able to express
[1:53:28] amen let's read one scripture as we
[1:53:30] close musicians you can come
[1:53:32] colossians chapter 3.
[1:53:38] colossians chapter 3
[1:53:42] verse 14.
[1:53:48] book of colossians chapter 3 and i want
[1:53:50] to read one verse verse 14.
[1:53:53] and above all
[1:53:55] these things
[1:53:56] put on charity
[1:53:58] which is the bond
[1:54:00] of perfectness
[1:54:02] everything
[1:54:04] and the message everything in the word
[1:54:06] everything is leading us to this
[1:54:07] conclusion
[1:54:09] to the love of god
[1:54:10] man let's all stand
[1:54:15] i want to thank you mothers
[1:54:17] for displaying a love to us that teaches
[1:54:19] us
[1:54:20] that we have to go a little further
[1:54:23] every mother that's cared for an infant
[1:54:24] every mother that's carried and given
[1:54:26] her body for a baby that sacrificed her
[1:54:28] sleep sacrificed her own health
[1:54:31] sacrificed everything
[1:54:33] and then there were times that i would
[1:54:34] come home from work and it looked like
[1:54:36] war had happened
[1:54:39] food i mean
[1:54:42] it was a bad day
[1:54:44] but that mother would do it all again
[1:54:46] the next day
[1:54:48] and i thank you mothers for
[1:54:50] especially ones who are living in the
[1:54:52] word for showing us what a true mother's
[1:54:54] love is
[1:54:56] and all it does is give us a springboard
[1:54:58] to say if this love can be expressed on
[1:55:00] this earth and it's human and it's
[1:55:02] motherly
[1:55:04] how much more with the love of god can
[1:55:07] we give of ourselves and sacrifice and
[1:55:10] suffer wrong and do all of these things
[1:55:13] i say thank you mothers for giving us an
[1:55:15] example
[1:55:16] but we're going to have to go beyond the
[1:55:18] mother's love
[1:55:19] to express this kind of love it's going
[1:55:21] to take the very love of god
[1:55:24] and if you walk away with any thought i
[1:55:25] want you to walk away with this thought
[1:55:27] registered deep into your heart
[1:55:30] fruits
[1:55:31] without love
[1:55:33] brought apostasy
[1:55:35] we can have all kinds of manifestations
[1:55:38] and demonstrations
[1:55:40] but if it doesn't contain the love of
[1:55:42] god
[1:55:43] it'll bring us into
[1:55:44] apostasy and we are not put on this
[1:55:47] earth to repeat the error of the first
[1:55:49] church age
[1:55:50] we've been put here for more than that
[1:55:53] we expect to see fruits we expect to see
[1:55:55] demonstrations
[1:55:57] but we should see it operating because
[1:55:59] of love
[1:56:01] by love and for love
[1:56:04] amen
[1:56:05] when i was a boy i thought love was
[1:56:07] wimpy and girly and now i'm realizing
[1:56:09] love is so tough
[1:56:11] so hard
[1:56:13] it requires
[1:56:14] everything
[1:56:16] love pulls a strength out of a woman
[1:56:19] that is surprising
[1:56:21] there's been stories of a mother lift a
[1:56:23] car off of her baby when a
[1:56:25] car overrolled her baby got trapped
[1:56:27] there's a story i read one time when i
[1:56:29] was a boy of a mother who fought a
[1:56:31] mountain lion that attacked her child
[1:56:33] she died in the struggle but saved her
[1:56:35] children
[1:56:37] you got to realize love is not this
[1:56:39] feeling thing
[1:56:42] that we've been talking about all our
[1:56:43] lives
[1:56:45] but love is hearty
[1:56:47] love is strong love is genuine love is
[1:56:50] real love is steadfast love is unmovable
[1:56:54] love is unbreakable love is undefeatable
[1:56:58] and i say god i want that kind of love
[1:57:01] in my life
[1:57:03] let's just bow our heads together and
[1:57:05] ask god
[1:57:06] lord jesus we thank
[1:57:08] you god we love you
[1:57:11] because you first loved us
[1:57:14] god without your perfect love
[1:57:17] everything becomes fruitless lord it
[1:57:19] becomes pointless
[1:57:21] if everything we experience and talk
[1:57:23] about and live for doesn't come to
[1:57:26] produce a capstone love in us
[1:57:28] it's worthless
[1:57:30] but oh god i pray that you would bring
[1:57:32] us to that place you envisioned us to be
[1:57:34] in before the foundation of the world
[1:57:37] it was your desire your plan your word
[1:57:41] and god we're here lord as your children
[1:57:43] to fulfill this portion of the word that
[1:57:45] you left for this day to be fulfilled
[1:57:49] god you've brought us to the capstone
[1:57:51] of perfect love
[1:57:53] god we're asking lord that you would
[1:57:55] move everything out of the way as we
[1:57:57] surrender to you
[1:57:58] and that you would take greater
[1:58:00] preeminence than ever before in us
[1:58:02] and let love prevail above it all lord
[1:58:06] god more than any gift i want divine
[1:58:08] love
[1:58:09] more than any treasure earthly treasure
[1:58:12] more than blessings that you could pour
[1:58:14] upon me in material goods
[1:58:16] god more than anything let me have this
[1:58:18] perfect love
[1:58:20] for that's the only thing that will
[1:58:22] enter in
[1:58:23] to that other dimension
[1:58:25] god i give myself to you
[1:58:27] i want to love you with all my heart
[1:58:29] with all my soul with all my mind with
[1:58:31] all my strength
[1:58:33] and lord i desire to love my neighbor as
[1:58:35] myself i want to fulfill all the word
[1:58:39] god i pray that you would take us as
[1:58:40] your people lord as you've demonstrated
[1:58:43] so well through the love of a mother
[1:58:45] and love of a mother dear and a mother
[1:58:47] possum and a poor mother in memphis and
[1:58:50] a mother run into a fire and all these
[1:58:52] things that we've seen
[1:58:54] and the stories that are surrounding us
[1:58:56] lord you've showed us what real genuine
[1:58:59] love is like
[1:59:00] the lord is calling us to a higher love
[1:59:03] god put that higher love inside me now
[1:59:06] in jesus name
[1:59:07] god i'm ashamed for the way i spoke in
[1:59:09] the past i'm ashamed for the criticism
[1:59:11] i've had towards brothers
[1:59:13] i'm ashamed lord of thinking evil and
[1:59:15] being selfish and self-centered i'm
[1:59:18] ashamed of those things lord
[1:59:20] forgive me for those things now
[1:59:22] god i want them all to die and fade away
[1:59:25] but i want your perfect love that can
[1:59:27] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:59:30] hopeth all things i want that love i
[1:59:32] want a love that's not puffed up in vain
[1:59:35] and vaunteth not itself but suffereth
[1:59:37] lord and giveth lord i want that kind of
[1:59:40] perfect love
[1:59:42] from first corinthians 13
[1:59:44] to manifesting me lord
[1:59:46] i give you my life afresh i lay down my
[1:59:48] life i want to step out in front of the
[1:59:51] gun barrel right now
[1:59:53] as that mother did for that fawn and
[1:59:55] lord i'm willing to die
[1:59:57] to have this kind of love
[1:59:59] i want you lord to live inside of me
[2:00:02] in a greater way than you ever have
[2:00:04] inside of this people lord lord i
[2:00:06] present them to you
[2:00:08] i just pray god that you would do a work
[2:00:10] in all of us lord that's far beyond our
[2:00:12] thinking far beyond our imagination but
[2:00:14] let the reality lord strike that the
[2:00:17] world will know that this is real it's
[2:00:19] not a put on it's not a religion it's
[2:00:21] not a church activity this is the
[2:00:22] reality lord
