Grace that has brought us back together and Lord you've put a joy in our hearts Lord where we love to worship you we love to see your word Lord as it's manifest before us but we pray that you would help us now as we look into your word may you take this vessel under your control For Your Glory mama you did give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us and may we lord glory in your in your Perfection and in your word and may you equip us Lord and may you teach us out of your word by your own hand may you feed us may we bring glory and honor to your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you while we're standing let's turn to the Gospel of John and let's look at chapter one and it's good to be with you this morning I want to remind you that we have communion and feet washing this afternoon so we'll mention that again at the end of the service so we'll begin looking at John chapter 1. verse 1. scripture we've read so very many times but I think we could preach on this for years and never really touched the depths of it John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men may God bless you as you take your seats for a subject I'd like to take the Life by the word life by the word so in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God we know that that in him was life and that life is the light of men so in the word is life amen and so we know that we know that but the prophet taught us that the the word is a thought expressed and the thought is the very essence of God it is who God is his attributes his thoughts and as he began to express himself and when God began to express who he was and what he was he expressed it through word and the word is the thought that is expressed and then that word would come into manifestation and it would be a manifestation or a revealing of God and that word has life and that word is life amen and so life comes by the word amen so so I don't think whatever I don't think we'll ever come to the uh I don't say ever but I don't think we've yet come to the appropriate appreciation for the word that's been revealed to us amen and the power that it holds in the life that it brings and the work that God is accomplishing through his revealed word it actually brings his life on the scene it actually brings his attributes his thoughts his desires amen coming through the word brings his very life through the word amen and there's Life by the word so I want to look at a bit of a familiar subject but I want to go through it again because to me it's very rich and brings such an understanding of God and the power of his word and the message God who is rich in Mercy from 1965 the prophet says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then praise be to God and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you node where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it amen praise be to God we know this I mean we've been taught this so many times but I don't I don't ever want this to become old because this is the very power of God in our lives because we had no power to come to him he had to draw us how did he draw Us by his word so where did the drawing power come from from the seed that was inside of us already amen it was already there and it was the thing it had life in it already but it took contact with the present tense word to Quicken that life and bring it into a manifestation in our life amen that's why brother Branham says you can he was reflecting back on his childhood days and and saying many of you can you can you can sympathize with me on this you you know what I'm talking about there was something in you all the way and there would be little little I don't know little Tremors of it or little movements of it or something that would move it or stir it from time to time amen and then maybe you went from church to church and you're picking out some things but when you heard the word amen now listen brother remember said you went from church or heard the gospel went from the nomination to nomination but that wasn't yet the word that would Quicken the seed the word that would Quicken the seed was the word that was a match to that seed amen they had to have a matching word for that seed and you were born amen you were born not for a Pentecostal age you were not born for a Lutheran age amen you were born for a bright age message you were born to receive the message of the end time and it would take the end time message to wake up that seed and it wasn't something you had the power to do yourself it wasn't something you've done for yourself we had no power to do this for ourselves amen there was already the capacity to believe placed down inside and it was waiting to come in contact with something amen that would Quicken it to life and bring it into manifestation and you being part of God Amen that's back before back before the beginning you were part of God Amen back before you were part of his thoughts and because you're part of his thoughts you're part of his word amen because a word is a thought expressed so you were always part of God you had because you were being part of God you had to be part of the word amen so that makes you part of the word all right so then he says I want to repeat this last sentence you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you so the word for this day seemed the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it these two pieces came together because they're two pieces of the same thing amen they're magnetized to one another because they come from the same Source amen and they were magnetized to each other so you saw the word let's look at First Peter chapter one foreign chapter 1 verse 23. so First Peter 1 and 23 being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible your first birth was a corruptable seed it was corrupted in the Garden of Eden but your second birth comes by an Incorruptible seed that was already in you being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God what's the mechanism that brings this seed to life it's the word of God Amen you're born again not of corruptable seed not not another birth like your first birthday amen this is going to be a spiritual birth not by corruptable seed but by Incorruptible seed by the word of God the word of God is going to bring this new birth to The Incorruptible seed that was where that was always in you amen when did he put it in you before the foundation of the world Amen and so now he would use the mechanism of the word to bring The Incorruptible seed to life so you cannot be born again without the sea Gene of God Amen it's the sieging of God that's quickened to Life by the word of God that is the new birth praise be to God and to be part of that means you are part of God to be part of that means you're part of the word amen and to be part of the word means you you never can be lost because he's not going to lose the word he's not going to lose himself he had a plan for you and I amen and that that plan as a Plan of Redemption and we were never in Jeopardy of being forever separated from God because God had a plan God knew what he would do and God God would not lose himself remember you're part of God Amen and when we start to talk about these things it's important that we realize which we all realize every one of us realize that the man you look at in the mirror is not the one we're talking about that's the one that's part of that corruptable seed by corruptable birth that's the one we wrestle with that's our enemy amen that's the one that that gives us trouble amen but we're talking about the the real you the sea you the that that what God intended to be you from the beginning that inner man amen that's been brought to life by the word that's the part that was with God Amen the very Gene of God the very uh word of God Amen that's the part that we're talking about and and if we don't if we don't keep these things separated amen we begin to look at at flesh and flesh beings and flesh mistakes and we begin to think this could never be me amen don't look at the man in the mirror look in the mirror of the word and look at the reflection in the mirror of the word and then you'll find yourself amen not in your mirror but in the mirror of the word is where you'll find your identity it goes deeper than the flesh amen in future home the prophet says Satan sin and sinners has gone forever it's all done blended into eternity and all that was perverted that great Archangel that set there one day Satan that did all this evil will be destroyed you remember the Bible said if that Soul won't do as he did said do he will even destroy that Soul do you see he can't destroy himself and remain God so if that soul is of the world it has to be destroyed but if it's Eternal with God it never did begin because it's part of God and can never be destroyed amen if the seeding of God was in you that Soul can never be destroyed amen because God cannot destroy himself and remain God so our Salvation is secure it's very secure amen but I want to look at Salvation in a broader sense and not just for the bride I want to start here so that we understand where we fit into the picture of God we know that we're saved by grace through faith and that not of ourselves it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast so God made it really clear for us that it was nothing you did it's what he did amen it wasn't your Works your efforts your decisions none of that amen is what brought you salvation but you're saved by grace through faith because you were able to believe the word and that was not of yourselves that was a gift of God so that is not of work so there's no boasting whatsoever amen this Revelation should bring the bride into a genuine humility recognizing I'm not special because I'm special amen I'm special because he chose me before the foundation of the world and placed something in me amen that I had nothing to do with that's what brings such a devotion out of the Bride when we see what he did for us amen what he did for us separated from our own efforts and our own merits he did it anyways it was his choosing it was his thought before the foundation of the world not mine and through all my blunders and all my mistakes and all my backslidings and families it has never changed God's plan what what a love and what a devotion is in our hearts because of that but I want to look at uh the the Judgment of the world those that are not bride those that are not sieging of God they're not Eternal thoughts of God we've been through this before but it does it's it's something worth looking at because it's so so unique to the message to the teaching of a prophet in our day that's different than every other teaching that's out there in Christian circles you know the people before have accused the message of being exclusive but really when you look at it through the teachings of the prophet in our day when he brings us back to the scripture it's the most inclusive teaching I've ever seen in my life there is more Mercy amen demonstrated to the message of the hour than I have seen through any other teaching of any other denomination anywhere else in any other Christian circles amen and it shows the true nature of God Amen because God is a Creator amen God is love and God is just and righteous in everything that he does and this message shows God that way amen and so no matter what the what what no matter what accusations are out there they're completely unfounded amen God has a bride he has a bride of his own choosing that's not our fault it's not even because we say so it's because the word says so amen it's not what we say it's what he said it's not what we made up it's what he determined before the foundation of the world it's not our fault that God's heart purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing that's not the fault of the Bride it's not the fault of those that receive this word amen so so there's no there's no blame that's going to be penned on us because we didn't call ourselves we didn't give ourselves faith we didn't send the word in this day we never sent a prophet we never worked all the signs and miracles through him we didn't have the clouds show up we didn't have the light the pillar of fire with the picture taken in Houston we didn't do any of this he did it all and we never decided he decided and he drew us amen and he called us and he put a seed inside of us to receive the word it was all him not us so we have the devil's answer to every accusation it's not me it's him I didn't do this he did this and you know people will say well you think you're this I don't think I'm anything amen I'm just receiving by faith what he's given me to receive I can't help it I didn't wake up one day and said I'm deciding I'm going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ because that sounds like a lot of fun I I wasn't looking to be a bride of Jesus Christ I was going to a church a church that I had been a system that I've been raised in all of my life and I just wanted to be a good boy and I wanted to do the minimum to get to heaven unfortunately that was the way I was living that day but God found me God found you God sent this word god am entitled all the loose sins together God manifest his word and God revealed his word and God planted a seed in you before the foundation of the world that would recognize it as true so there's there's no guilt and no shame and that there's no responsibility in us the responsibility was in God all we do is receive it by faith and confess it because we believe it so no matter what anybody says it's not our fault no matter what anybody says to you or an accusation or an attitude it's not our fault I didn't have anything to do with it I was just breathing in and out and living the best life I knew how to live and he intercepted me he called me he revealed himself to me and he had already planted something in me that would say I don't understand that I I can't figure it out but I know it's the truth and that was that seed of faith so now let's look at how God deals with the rest of humanity in the in the message things that are to be he says now before we open the Bible now anybody that's got physical strength can open in this manner but it takes the Holy Spirit to open the word to US Open our understanding and reveal the scriptures I believe in the Bible I believe that it's God's word I believe that the Earth or the peoples of the earth will be judged Someday by this word this is so important that that brother bam says the the the Earth the peoples of the earth will be judged by his word amen and we know that Jesus Christ is the word of God it tells us so in John 1 1 amen and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and all things were made by him and we know that that word was eventually made flesh unto and among us we know that Christ is the anointed word amen and so so the Earth will be judged that's why Jesus Christ will judge the Earth but it's also why the Saints will judge the Earth because they are part of Christ they will sit with him on his throne they will sit with him in his judgment they will judge the world they will judge Angels amen because they are part of Christ because they are part of the word all right but the the world then the Earth the inhabitants of the Earth the peoples of the earth will be judged by the word let's go to John chapter 5. John chapter 5 verse 24. verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation that word condemnation is translated the majority of the times in the New Testament as judgment shall not come into the Judgment but is passed from Death unto life so those that believe Christ in whatever way and whatever day Christ is presented they have passed from death into life there is now no judgment there is no judgment they already he says he says uh he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life you already have it it's in the seed I mean that's why you could believe in the day and age that you live when you encounter Christ in your day you can believe because you already have everlasting life you shall not come into the Judgment but you've passed from death into life that's the position of the Bride she won't come into the Judgment at the white Throne judgment because she'll be sitting on the throne ministering to her husband Christ sitting with him in judgment judging the world right so we want to we want to look at that and questions and answers in 1964 he says now then at this time the Gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she'll only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification then she has to suffer for her Deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ because he is the word that body was rendered and when that body was rendered the bride was in that body because it's all the word because if you're part of God then you're part of his word Christ is the anointed word you're part of Christ and when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross and that body was rented the word was made flash if you're part of the word then you were there in that manifestation and when that word was bleeding amen you were there and included in it now there's no more punishment there's no more need for purification that was your purification and now we're washed in the bleeding word amen as the word comes forth and purifies the bride because we were there all right he says in the God of this evil age and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there praise be to God when when he was paying for the sins of the world because I am part of God and part of the word when the word was made flesh and then became the price of redemption and was nailed to the cross and was punished for sin I was included there amen and so I'm a benefactor of that because I'm part of that word now there's no more coming to the Judgment it's already been judged there's no coming to the Judgment at the white don't judgment because I've passed from Death unto life passed Beyond judgment because it was already judged I paid for my sins there in him there so the bride is absolutely utterly and completely secure in Christ there's nothing to worry about there's nothing to fear there's nothing to bring anxiety everything's already settled paid for decided amen now we're walking in the plan of God to manifest the light he once manifest through Us in this day it's his doing if we just yield to his hand and relax everything's taken care of that's us so we are part of this word in the church age book and the Patmos vision and I'm going to say the disclaimer here don't wait for me to get wound up and start preaching I'm teaching this morning so stay with me you stay wound up because this is already my Pace all right stick with the word so don't wait for me to lay a foundation and get going uh we're going praise God the church age book he says then it goes on to say how God is going to judge men here it is in verse 5 to 17 the hard and impedant heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word no one escaping him those who heard and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested in it saying they believed it but did not live it will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the housetops oh we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left from all the ages he's talking about the white Throne judgment and if we get a picture of this let's turn to the Book of Revelation chapter 20 and take a look at it in the Book of Revelation Revelation chapter 20 and verse 11. I Revelation 20 and 11 and I saw a great white throne in him that sat on him from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire so we find in this judgment this white Throne judgment this takes place at the end of the millennial Reign after the Thousand-Year reign with Christ and his bride after the honeymoon there comes a white Throne judgment and in this judgment all the dead those that slept for the Thousand Years all the dead are resurrected and they stand before Christ and we know that the bride is present on the throne with Christ amen judging with him and and it says there was books opened and another book opened which is The Book of Life Amen in order to pass just judgment you have to have your name on The Book of Life but there's also other books and then these other books it says and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works amen the bride is not judged according to her works for for her basis of Salvation she's judged according to the works that she did for rewards amen but never for condemnation amen but they're judged according to their Works amen there's something that they did or there's something that they didn't do amen and and I don't think that I don't think that in this judgment if you allow me just to uh uh just give maybe my own thinking I don't think that God is going to be standing there and says when you were five you kicked the dog and when you did this there's something in these books on these works that are determining where they go there's something in these books there's something that they did or something that they didn't do amen that's determining amen the Eternal destination whether they go to the lake of fire or they find entrants into life everlasting life life Beyond Time amen and so there's something's written down there's a record that's been taken and it will be disclosed in this judgment but there's also the book of life so they must be in the Book of Life and there's something written in the books amen and so we find out that this has nothing to do with the bride amen because because everything for us has already been paid for and taken care of we've already made it we're not trying to make it we're not hoping to make it we're not looking at works as a way in or a way out or I'm going to lose out or I'm going to make it that has already decided Works has nothing to do with that now our works is our love back to God because we love to serve him and love to do for him but it's never an attaining to a better position how do you get a better position than the Bride of Jesus Christ so let's look at John chapter 5 again let's go back to John chapter 5. John chapter 5. verse 28. John 5 and 28 Marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice so this is not the resurrection this is not the Rapture this is everybody that's in the graves will hear his voice this is the second Resurrection unto judgment all right we together on that Marvel for this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto resurrection of life and they that have done evil into the resurrection of damnation once again this is a judgment that has to do with their works and has to do with their deeds they that have done evil to damnation they that have done good unto life this is the general Resurrection at the end of the Thousand Years when all the dead stand before Christ and his bride and this judgment all will hear his voice and all will come forth out of the grave and it'll be a resurrection unto life or death it'll be a resurrection and a judgment amen those that have done evil and those that have done good I'm so thankful that we get to bypass this judgment I'm so thankful that I don't have to stand in a judgment that has to do with my Deeds I'm so thankful that that was already paid for Calvary for us we were already included in that my sins are absolved my sins are paid for Amen in my faith in the word is a testimony that I was a part of it in that day amen and I so thankful to God that I don't have to come in this judgment in the Smyrna I'm sorry sardisian Church age out of the church age book he said but it is even most accurately set forth in Psalm 69 that is the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the Destroyers of his people whose names are removed he's talking about the removal from The Book of Life and he says we we we know this so well but in the book of life amen is a record of life there's names in The Book of Life that can be blotted out can be removed amen God speaks of this and we know Judas had his name recorded in heaven his name was part of the book of life but he rejected Christ his name was removed amen but there's a section of the Book of Life called The Eternal wheat seed section or the eternal life section amen and that is the section where God recorded his bride his seed genes and nothing will ever change in that section of the book no name can be blotted out and if you're part of his bride you were in that book and in that section of the book before the foundation of the world nothing can change you're not in jeopardy of losing anything amen but if you're in the general book of life that name can be blotted out what causes that name to be removed from the book of life it says it is the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the Destroyers of his people whose names are removed who's removed those who reject Christ and remember Christ is the anointed word for your day they were rejecting Christ in Moses day even before Jesus Christ came into manifestation amen and and walked by the Sea of Galilee and come out of Nazareth there was Christ back there and there was those who were rejecting Christ in Moses day because he was that rock that followed them through the wilderness Christ has always been the anointed word for your day and and to reject that is considered evil that is evil Deeds not not you know not the evil things you did when you were a kid not the mischievous things those are all wrong those are all evil we understand that not not you cheated on your taxes and not all of those that's not the list of things that I think we're going to read amen we're going to read what did you do with the word because the judgment is based off the word all judgment is based off this word amen what did you do with this word what did you do with this word called Christ that's what this judgment is based off of he says I'll read this again it's the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the Destroyers of his people whose names are removed as Israel the chosen people of God in majority forfeited their rights in the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the majority of the Gentile church was also come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their names from The Book of Life by rejecting the word and thereby entering into the world ecumenical movement which is the image erected into the Beast what are these evil or righteous Deeds you know growing up I can just tell you growing up in denominational circles amen we get we get such ideas you know we get all these ideas that the righteous deed is helping the little old lady across the street and the unrighteous deed is stealing from work and those are righteous and unrighteous Deeds amen but it's much much deeper than that because it's what did you do with the word that was presented to you amen that it there's there's something that God is looking for and there's something by which God is basing his judgment on and he's basing it on the word amen you can be ever so nice and do everything so nice and do everything so right and still not pass this judgment you can be kind to everybody you can do great charitable deeds and great works you can never take what's not yours never speak evil of anybody you can do all those things right and still not pass this judgment because this judgment is a judgment based on the word let's go to Matthew 25. we all know most of us as anyways know this really well there's such a picture painted in Matthew 25 of what we're looking at this is also the scene of the white Throne judgment Matthew 25 31. Matthew 25 and 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now now brother Ben I'm in the church age book he explains to us where it says He Shall Gather All Nations and shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divided the sheep from the ghost He says these are not sheep in this judgment the sheep have already been gathered into the fold the Sheep are the children of God they are sitting with him on the throne this is just an analogy it's dividing the same way a Shepherd would divide sheep and goats this is not the separation of the sheep and the ghost the sheep have already been separated out the sheep or the Sheep of God Amen and he's already redeemed those sheep he's already called those sheep and we're already sitting with him in the throne this is just an analogy he's separating as a Shepherd would separate sheep and goats praise be to God that drives back so much confusion because because it looks like these are the Sheep these are the the children have gone and these are ghosts they're not children of God no no no the the seed of God have already been gathered home amen this is everybody else verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee are thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the Inn or naked and clothed thee our wind saw we be sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you and so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me Jesus was not saying with the crowd before him sheep and goats he was not saying as you've done it to the least of these in my breath no he was pointing to the ones that were sitting with him on the throne as you've done it to the least of these my brethren that are with me you've done it unto me because they are part of me because they are part of the word because they are part of Christ and as you did it to the least of these my brethren you did it unto me this is the same Revelation Paul got on the road to Damascus when the pillar of fire struck him down and he says boss all Saul why why amen persecute is thou me and he says Lord who are you that I'm Jesus whom you persecuted amen and he was Jesus in the form of his church he was touching the church but he was persecuting Jesus because the pillar of fire was in the church amen and they come into the church at Pentecost when Christ Divine himself and the spirit of Christ entered into the people and now Paul realized when I was hauling them to prison and I was beating them I was holding Christ to prison and I was beating Christ and these were the manifested word and now Paul found himself guilty against the word amen and now all down through time amen the anointed word Christ for every day has been manifest in his bride in the True Vine in the people of God Amen and the people are being judged in this judgment here on how they reacted to Christ amen because when you did it to the least of these my brother you did it to me and now you're entering into life because when I was naked you clothed me when I was hungry you fed me when I when I was sick you came to me they said Lord when did we do this they didn't even realize that they were serving the lord they didn't even know that this was the Lord they were doing something without full knowledge of what they were doing but the very actions Deeds The Works the things that are written in the book amen are coming up at the white Throne judgment and now they're being separated out and told this is why you're separated out and this is why you're coming into life because it's not about people it's about the word it's not about our flesh it's not because somebody was nice to you because you have pretty blue eyes and you have a nice part in your hair that has nothing to do with it it's how they treat the word that's living in you how they treat Christ that's living in his body his body is on Earth and his body is the true church is the bride and when they come in contact with a part of that body and they interact with the living word amen that record is what's being brought up now is that interaction with that word in their day because he's judging by the word amen it's not it's not uh it's not it's not the flesh part it's not the trivial part amen it's deeper than that it's not you because of your parentage you because of your temperament you because of this it's because you've been United with Christ because the seed has come alive because you're part of the manifested word for your day and that interaction with that word is determining something for eternity and remember well let's go on and read and then we'll come back 41 then shall I say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you curse it unto Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord wind saw we the hungered or a thirst or stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you in so much as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous and to life eternal what made their deeds evil how they treated the Manifest the word what made them righteous by how they reacted to the manifested word God is judging by his word he says in the sardestian church age the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of the Thousand Year when all the rest of the Dead live again and that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those in the second Resurrection those who in the second Resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast into the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of God we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew 25 31-46 which is what we just read it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a Shepherd divided sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white Throne judgment the Sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the Judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would make them join heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share No Throne Etc with them their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved because of what they do with the word he judges by the word everything is based off the word no doubt they served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamaliel they stood for the children in time of trouble he says if this seems the smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the Lake of Fire the names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day what what made them righteous and what made them evil what Deeds were wrong and what Deeds were right amen it's not a list of good boy deeds and bad boy Deeds it's how they reacted to the word that they encountered because he is the word and the word is his thought expressed so when you encounter the word you're encountering an expression of God and it's not really how you deal with these bodies of Flesh these clay Tabernacles that you see it's how you deal with God that is tabernacled in the clay Tabernacles how you interact with the word and whatever measure you come in contact with the word of God the way you deal with that word is the way you deal with God and the way you deal with God is the way that he deals with you in judgment it's about the word it's about God Almighty because God is the word amen the word was with God the word was gone amen God's life is in the word God's thoughts and men have come forth they've been declared by word it's himself in word form and now to reject that when it comes into manifestation is to reject almighty God and then we think we can get a pass at the white Throne judgment because I attended church and I paid tithes and I and I took care of my grandma and I took care of the elderly people across the street and I and I was part of this club and I was part of it no what did you do with God how did you treat God how did you react to God not social niceness not not socially accepted forms of righteousness and goodness but what is the goodness and righteousness God's looking at he's looking at how you react to him how you love him how you respect or honor him and he is manifested in the day and age you live in as the word may manifest that is God manifesting revealing himself in the way we interact with that is the way we interact with God he goes on to say the church age book thus if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in the section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for their names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of book of life but in the foreknowledge of God they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon the record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that I accept it and I'm thankful for it I thank God Amen that God has made a way of Escape for numerous people I thank God for those who are not even see genes of himself or not even part of his children he has made a way that they can enter into life Eminem I'm so thankful that God Amen God had so much love God had so much grace amen for us and for for anybody attached to us that he knew amen my seed will need help in the future so I'm going to write a name in The Book of Life in this name that I'm writing in The Book of Life may not ever be a church member may not ever be a preacher may not ever testify or confess or be baptized but I wrote their name here because one of my seed genes are going to need help one day and this is the person that's going to stand for them and if they'll never reject my word and stay true to that I will grant them entrance into life Everlasting what a God we serve what a message this is friends this isn't an exclusive message this is an inclusive message amen this is God reaching out to anybody that will respect him anybody that will honor him anybody that will hold him Amen in esteem he will likewise hold them in his name so no matter what anybody tells you exclusive and this and that and everybody is not in the brightest out that is so far from the truth friend that is so far from the reality that God and His grace and God in his Mercy he's made a way for multitudes he's made a way from multitudes to be in the new heavens and the new Earth to dwell to live to live in Perfection to live in harmony amen than the selves to receive a perfect body Amen to live when there's no sin when there's no unrighteousness when there's no ungodliness when there's no death when there's no time they're allowed to enter into that not because they have eternal life we have eternal life because we're part of God's life they're allowed to come into life with no more time which is eternal life not having previously possessed it but allowed to enter in because God is gracious because God is merciful because God's plan is bigger than man's plan God's Mercy is greater than man's Mercy oh God is good we've talked before on this subject we've talked about the the the city dwellers in the New Jerusalem are the elect of God the deceiting of God they live in that city they're allowed to to dwell there amen because it's all God everything that's dwelling there is God as he's made himself manifest and come into flesh Through Time but the gates of the city are never closed no one who goes into the new heavens and new earth are shut out of this city they may not be part of the city but they're allowed to come in and out as they please amen why because they served the word in their life because they serve their word in their life they have access to the word all the time in the new heavens and new earth and I wonder how many how many sweet reunions will be there as those outside the city come in and out and in and out and we meet them and fellowship with them and talk to them and are so thankful that this message wasn't exclusive so thankful that God's plan was so rich in Mercy that he would allow somebody entrance into this life solely solely because they were good and kind to the brethren praise be to God let's go to Mark chapter 9. Mark chapter 9. and verse 41. for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward Jesus is looking at something as minor as a cup of cold water but because you belong to Christ and they do it because you're in the Name of Christ that little deed won't lose its reward God keeps Good Records I believe that's what's wrote in that book those books that are opened at the white Throne judgment in perfect Faith the prophet of God says Jesus had perfect faith and it come and it came because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word so as we receive this word we become the word because this word brings The Incorruptible seed to life and begins to manifest the life of the word and that word on display amen is Christ and it gives people an opportunity uh let's look at Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8. verse 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ that from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you God is actually by the Spirit dwelling you he's quickening your mortal body to manifest his word he's taking control amen he's quickened the seed inside of you but he's also quickening this body Amen to come to the life of the word to Manifest this word out of this body because that's somebody's linked to God Amen that is somebody's connection to Christ because they said when did we serve you when did we feed you when did we do this he said when you did it to the least of my brethren that was the flesh that was the interaction point you had to interact with the word and because of that receive life Everlasting entrance into eternal life and so God is quickening by his spirit this flesh to manifest his word and the message the Harvest time he said in that day Luke 17 20 I believe it is Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you you are the reflection of this hour the message I'm in reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in Christ Jesus so where is the word on display it's in display and you and I amen and some of the some of these individuals will receive entrance into eternal life and they'll say when Lord when did we do this when did we do that I mean they didn't even know they were righteous they didn't even know the righteous Deeds were going to enter them in they didn't even know what they were doing for the Lord and to say when you did it to these my brethren you've done it unto me because we are the word made flesh and Christ The Mystery of God who really says notice now down Through the Ages he is gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets through the times now we can just go on and express himself he expresses himself in Moses look at Moses born in the time of persecution of children he was born to be a deliverer he was hidden the bull rushes just like Jesus was so he's showing all the way through there was a manifestation of Christ in Moses there was a manifestation of Christ and David a manifestation of Christ in Jeremiah amen what was it it was a spirit of God working through these men manifesting the word for their season amen and what people did with that word determined how they were judged so we know that the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory but all what hinges on Christ in you what of Eternal consequence is hinging on Christ in you God wrote in a book of life before the foundation of the world names and he tells us through the prophet that no names are being added to this record it was sealed before the foundation of the world there's not another name being added so whatever name is found on the book of life was placed there before the foundation of the world so it's not as though somebody can come and do a kind deed and have their name added no their name has to already be there which means God had in his mind salvation for many more than just his bride God had in his mind amen he he already knew the plan from beginning to end he already could foresee what he was going to do because he already had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he knew there would be a fall he knew the consequence of the Fall he knew there would need to be a lamb he knew there would need to be individuals amen that he would secure so he wrote amen the section of eternal life in the Lamb's Book of Life and secured it but he also put other names in there because these are so few he needs support they need help they need other people and God provided it before the foundation of the world they don't even know what they're doing but God knows God knows God knows who would stand up for you at work God knows who would help you in a time of need God has provided everything for his word and everybody that has the privilege of playing a positive part in the word moving forward gets a benefit for that and I'm so thankful to serve a God Like That a righteous God who's righteous in everything that he does brother remember said you are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express himself through it that all the nations might know him you are a living images of God that God wants to work through you are literally the word made flesh let's look at Revelation chapter six I want to look at now salvation of the Jews Revelation chapter 6. verse 9. Revelation 6 and 9 this is the fifth seal and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled we know that this physio is whether I'm taught in the fifth seal that these are Jews here we find in the fifth seal because they they were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held not the testimony of Jesus Christ these aren't Saints these aren't church members this is the these are Jews and they're also crying out for revenge for Christians don't cry out for Revenge they forgive so he shows us that these are Jews and these are the Jews from the time of Christ all the way through till the rapture all the way through to the calling of the 144 000 and he's and he shows that this is this group and they're given white robes because they're recipients of Grace and he begins to talk about this in the sardesian church age it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar are set forth in the fissile are given white robes and of course eternal life or there could be no point of white robes and when he had opened the fifth seal as I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice how long O Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony to Jesus they were not like Antipas who was slain for holding fast his name they are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word why are they giving life because of the word what's judgment based on because judgment's based on the word because they were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held look what he says and notice now these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek in Christ forgive them Father these are Jews they have to be because they are in the fifth seal and it is a force field that the Gentile bride has gone in the Rapture so these are these Jews aren't born of the spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is the Messiah but as they were blinded by God for the Gentile sake God gave them eternal life on the grounds that they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died for it as multitudes died under Hitler's Stalin Etc and yet die these Jews amen who never recognized Jesus Christ as the Messiah for two thousand years nearly amen they've been going down in death they've been holding to an Old Testament law they've been holding to the word but if they were faithful to hold to that because God blinded their eyes and would not allow them to see the truth because he blinded them he's righteous amen and he's not going to judge them for the part he blinded them for what he's judging them for is how they held to the portion of the word that was still available to them he did he God is righteous he doesn't blind somebody and then judge you for being blind he blinded them he blinded them so he could come and get you and I amen but he still judges them based off the word that part of the word that's still available for them what they do with that word determines their Eternal destination because he judges based off the word we see the theme God is righteous in all things and he judges based off his word let's look at the foolish virgin same same section of the church age book in the sardisian church age so it is the second Resurrection wherein the five foolish virgin comes up notice they were virgin they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became part of that bride but these people being separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time he's talking about the foolish virgin amen the foolish virgin do not have a seed to believe with they don't have the seed that you have to believe the message and they have no Spirit of Revelation given to them they they can't come to the message you couldn't come unless God drawed you you couldn't come unless there was an eternal sea Gene of God down on the inside a receptor a representation of predestination that would say that's the truth you couldn't come to the message without that amen you had no ability to bring yourself to truth and believe the truth God already placed it in you and then God Drew you to it and he revealed it to you by his Spirit you didn't do it he did it these people they can't do it they cannot come to the revelation of the word because they don't have representation of predestination on the inside they don't have the word to receive the word with amen but what they have they give fully to the word that's open to them and they try their best to live the word that's available to them and with whatever little capacity that they have they give it to the word that's available you know the Bible has a surface level there's a surface level to the Bible not reading between the lines not seeing the types and shadows but just the surface level that you can catch intellectually amen if this foolish virgin lives clean doesn't throw away the word but tries to live the portion that's given to them and stays true and is is a help in the work of the Lord guess what happens at the white Throne judgment they're judged based off the portion of the word that was available to them they're judged by the word that they had praise be to God trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the Millennium which you can begin to see by these truth is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remained but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the Lake of Fire why because they fought Christ the word because they rejected Christ the word and they pushed out Christ the word and they fought Christ the word and they condemned Christ the word where was he he was in his church and because they resisted that their names are removed blotted out of the book of life and they go into damnation but anybody who respects God God respects them I love this message let's look at let's look a couple more scriptures let's look at Psalms 96. I want to look at one more thing out of the word that just thrilled my heart Psalms 96. and verse 10. Psalms 96 and 10. say among the Heathen that the Lord reigneth the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the people righteously God will judge righteously he will not blind and then judge you for being blind he'll blind you but he'll judge you based off the word that was still available he will allow you to come in contact with his word and in whatever way you come in contact with that word with whatever manifestation whatever degree he will judge you based off that and if you loved him and honored him and respected him then he can honor and respect you the reason I love this so much is because when we get to the new heavens and new earth there is no sin there is no unrighteousness there is nothing but the word when we get the new heavens and the Earth it's the word it's only the word there's no perversion there's no sin it's the word made manifest and if you didn't love the word when you came in contact with it how are you going to love the word over there because God is righteous in all ways if you hated the word here you will never want to live there if you could not stand the word if you could not take the word if it if it irritated you if you didn't agree with it you'd never be a candidate to live in the new heaven the new Earth you'd be a miserable person there because if it's those who love God and love his word amen they might not even know what it is they're loving but they love something in you a life in you that they can love and respect they don't know that that's the word they just know there's something different about you and if they love that little bit that you're manifesting wait till they get over to new heavens and new earth and that little bit they were attracted to blows up and is everywhere and everything and all-encompassing they'll be in heaven but the person who couldn't take your righteousness couldn't stand the fact that you lived clean hated amen the fact that you bowed your head and prayed they'll never want to be there anyways because God judges righteously god is perfect he gives everyone an opportunity and they express their own judgment amen man condemns himself man judges himself God allows them amen to have contact in some way with a portion of him because remember his thoughts are are the word his thoughts expressed which is God expressing himself and if you can't respect that expression and if you don't love it there's no point in you going on Beyond Time now let's look at Romans chapter 2. when you see the word when the message opens the word you see that God is absolutely perfect there is no there is no unrighteousness whatsoever in God there is no unfairness there's no that God is absolutely completely just righteous and perfect in every way and I've never seen him so beautiful as I've seen him through this word when the seals come off the word you see how beautiful that he really is let's look at chapter 2 Romans chapter 2 verse 11. for there is no respect of persons with God for as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law though these who did not know the word coming up to this point those who did not know the word they'll perish without the word God will judge them based off what they had so for as many as Sin without the law shall also perish without the law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the Lord just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles remember the Gentiles were heathens for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel when God comes to the white Throne judgment and everybody that has ever lived upon the Earth comes and stands for him God has a way of judging everyone whether they heard the word spoken read out of a book where they come in contact with a sea Gene of God or not God has a way of judging everybody according to his word and he said these Gentiles who have not the law let's read it carefully verse 14 for when the Gentiles which have not the law which to them is the word this is the Old Testament the word do by Nature the things contained in law these having not the law are a law unto themselves so when those by the law of Nature and conscience They Know listen you can find pygmy Indians in the middle of Africa who know it's wrong to murder they didn't need the law to know it was wrong to murder they know it's wrong to steal and they know it's wrong to take another man's wife they have laws amongst themselves forbidding these kind of unrighteous what is it it's the law of conscience the law of nature man has a conscience he has a nature in him that knows that there are certain things that are not right how is it so common across so many different Aboriginal tribes that they have the same basic standard of it's wrong to murder it's wrong to steal it's wrong to take amen somebody else's wife where did they come up with this it's the law of nature that is in the heart of man and when they by Nature do that which is contained in God's law they become a law unto themselves and now their own heart and mind either accuses or excuses one another God now has a basis to judge even these people because because listen to me carefully now these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness in their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel man has a conscience and a law the things that are contained in the law are also in the natural conscience of man and when man has the ability to live that conscience he accuses or excuses his fellow man who won't abide by that I want to look at something brother Branham said because I find it super interesting in the Ephesian Church age he says now I know and answering one question another one is apt to come up if people ask me if he fell that way by adultering what did Adam do for God lays the blame on Adam we know Adam didn't commit adultery Eve committed adultery not Adam that is simple the word of God is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of Stardust was made the word God's law was there exactly as it is written in our Bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she's an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back the word was true and Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take a responsibility upon himself he could not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold out the human race and the sin that he might have Eve for he loved her this is so astounding before anything was written on paper God's law was established in heaven just as it's written in our Bible amen and God held Adam accountable for that word Adam didn't have a Bible but Adam knew what he was doing was wrong because the law of God is set in heaven it's fixed but we have in our Bible is a reflection of a fixed law fixed word that was already in heaven before it came to Earth and before it came on paper amen and Adam amen when he did what was contrary to the law of God Amen he was rejected by God and we see this through the Old Testament because when when when uh when Abraham goes down with Sarah unto pharaoh and he lies and says this is my sister and Pharaoh finds out and and same thing happens with Isaac amen and same thing happens with abimelech they come and they then when they find out that this isn't your sister this is your wife they're scared to death because they almost sinned and did something wrong and took another man's wife who told them it was a sin there was no law written there was no Bible on Earth the Bible didn't start being written until we have a book of job that's old we don't know when it was wrote but Moses started putting together the law amen that's when the Bible came into position on the earth and that's when they were told that don't do this and don't do that but how did abimelech know how did Pharaoh know how did they all know because there was a law in the conscience of man they knew that this was wrong because that law was established in heaven and when God comes to abimelech who's going to take Sarah he says you know if you take her that's another man's wife if you take her you'll be a dead man he says Lord you know the Integrity of my heart didn't he say this is my sister and he says yea I know the Integrity of their heart that's why I warned you here you have a man who is not see Gene of God he is not what Abraham is but God seeing that he's righteous trying to fulfill the law of conscience God will come to him in a dream speak to him and warn him against sinning against the law of conscience how wonderful is our God how merciful is our God he saw that abimelech was not intending to do evil abimelech was following the law of conscience which matched the law in heaven and God knew that he was righteous and it was Abraham's fault not a beam Alex so he comes to a beam elect a non-seed non-abraham non-royal seed and warns him so that he won't fall into sin what Bible was abimelech reading he had the law of conscience and by Nature he was doing that which was written in the law and God had mercy on him he was already under a curse because God had shut fast the wounds of the of the servants and of his wife but God said have Abraham pray for you unless he prayed for your dead you can see what a difference there is between Abraham and abimelech there's a huge difference between Abraham and abimelech but because abimelech was holding true to that portion of the word that he had God honored abimelech and God protected abimelech God never even condemned Abraham and Abraham was one Abraham was so much further away he was so much in a different position with God than him like but God still honored a beamlet because abimelech was honoring God I love this Bible I love the God of this Bible and tell me where anywhere else on the earth that there is a there is a Ministry a message a teaching that will teach the god of the Bible the way he's actually written in the Bible with all the mercy and all the grace and all the opportunities he gives the different ones in different categories I'm telling you this Prophet was a prophet of God he knew more than the letter he could go to the heart of God bring the nature of God out and show it through this Bible and when he gets to the white Throne judgment I mean everybody else will say either you confess Jesus Christ as your savior you're in or you're out but this one comes and said these may not have confessed Jesus Christ their savior they're they're brought in solely on the fact that they honored the word when the word was presented to them where was it presented it was presented in the brethren in a body of Flesh manifesting the word and when they honored that God honored them because God judges by his word he judges the Jews by the word there was a portion he kept them from so he judged him on the portion that was open the foolish virgin could not receive revelation so what was commonly open and understood on a surface level when they would honor that and live true to that God would honor them as long as they didn't reject the truth as long as they didn't call it heresy as long as they didn't call it doctrine of devils as long as they as long as they just stayed in the portion that was open and stayed true to it God would honor them this word is wonderful our God is righteous this word is perfect and you will never see it this perfect anywhere outside the message of the hour you'll never see this kind of Mercy the sign of Grace this kind of God interacting with the Heathen King but God is perfect his word is perfect and he's given us a perfect interpretation his word with Divine vindication I'm so glad that I don't have to walk around and think of my family and think of people that I work with and people I associate with I'm so glad I don't have to walk around thinking they are all condemned to hell and they're all doomed because they don't have a seat of predestination they cannot receive what I'm able to receive I'm so glad I don't have to walk around and say this is the only time that I'll ever share with them but I can say if they can honor whatever capacity God allows them to come in contact with the word if they can honor and respect that amen our fellowship doesn't end here it can continue beyond time I love serving a god like that and I love walking through this Earth knowing that God knows who is who and I don't have to decide who is who and wherever somebody fits I'm going to let them fit wherever they fit into the economy of God sure we we want everybody to receive the message but not everybody can receive the message only those who are predestinated to receive it can receive it I'm so glad that I don't have to make somebody something they are what they are by the grace of God oh I'm so thankful that I don't have to determine amen God is already determined they're determining Now by how they react to the word of God and I thank God that he's that kind of God I'm so thankful that my father when when this may sound childish but when I see the message bring this truth to light I'm proud of my father I serve a God who is righteous I serve a God who is just I serve a God who is merciful I serve a God who is righteous in judgment he's not willy-nilly he doesn't let anything go he doesn't just say well I will pass on that no he's got a method by which he judges and he stays true to that method amen any judges by the word but he's perfectly righteous and merciful in his judgment now we realize that each individual one of us if you are a child of God you were a thought of God that's expressed in this day to manifest the word of God in your day and it doesn't matter what part you play it doesn't want what measure you have it doesn't matter your gender or your age or your locality or the gift that's in your life the very fact that you exist on this Earth gives somebody an opportunity to come in contact with the Living Word if you're a child in that condition you've been born again by the spirit of God if you're a teenager if you're in college if you're working if you're what if whatever you are in whatever capacity God has placed you every individual attribute of God that is an expressed word of God in this day there is a power in the fact that you're alive and there's an opportunity in the fact that you're here that can create an opportunity for somebody else so all of those interactions are not wasted our life our life means something the fact that God still chooses to be on display in this generation means something the fact that he's living in flesh and coming in contact with multitudes of individuals around the world mean something don't don't ever allow the enemy to trivialize our lives the very fact that God is walking in your flesh means something it means something that those people you're around those people you contact it may mean something for somebody you'll contact in the future but whatever however God works it out your everyday life matters and every uh everybody you come in contact with is presented with an opportunity and now God has Mercy on the Earth because his bride is here God has Mercy on the Earth because he's Tabernacle deity tabernacled and flesh because we are templing Christ Mercy is still here and I thank God for that let's read one more scripture as we close Psalms chapter 9. musicians if you want to make your way on up Psalms chapter 9. Psalms 9 and 7. but the Lord shall endure forever he hath prepared his throne for judgment and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall Minister judgment to the people in uprightness how many believe that to be every bit the truth how many see that that is every bit the truth god is perfect and he is beautiful and this message is the greatest Revelation that's ever struck this Earth to open up the Bible but not open up like doctrines but to open up the very person of the word and show us the very character and nature of a loving God I thank God for that let's all stand and like I said that was not new that's common to many of us but it sure did me a world of good I love this message let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your mercy Lord God it's overwhelming when we see that your thinking is so far superior to our thinking what denomination is denominations have come up with Lord is so narrow that it's not your nature are so broad that you can no longer be just and judged that way they've Fallen to the right and they've Fallen to the left either it's so narrow you can have no mercy or it's so broad you can no longer be just but God by the revelation of the word you've taken the seals off of your book and now we understand your mystery and you've brought us back to the reality of how you're merciful and just how you're good in every way and how you judge the world and uprightness and you're making no mistakes and everybody has had a fair chance every human being that has come on this Earth has had a fair chance Lord and God you're not going to judge for that which was withheld you're not going to judge for that which was not revealed but you're going to judge according to the word that each individual has come in contact with that portion of yourself that you allowed to be present God I pray that you would save the Lost I pray God that you would create opportunities Lord for those to come in contact with life I thank you for who you are I thank you Lord for your goodness and your mercy and your grace I thank you for your righteousness you're so perfect in every way God help us to stay true to this word help us as your people manifest and Shine the Light of the Gospel May Our Lives Lord reflect a true nature the true word Lord and may it be a Beacon Light that will attract others to you maybe they don't even know what they're coming to but Lord I pray God that they would come to life because of the portion of the word they contact help us to live a true life to manifest a true word forgive us Lord for anything that's hindered that expression move it from our lives but help us to live true to your word and be your Tabernacle on this Earth that you might finish the work that you've left for this day I love you I ask that you bless your people bless and guide us Lord as we depart and gather back again in a few hours for communion watch over us and keep us as we go and bring us back safely we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brother Ben or I was born [Music] [Music] a home for the presence [Music] that I might be what I was for me for I was born to be all of the Lord [Music] let my love now be separated [Music] amen God bless you we'll gather back at 4 pm for Community feet washing for those who can make it God bless you and we'll see you soon or I was born to be a dwell ing [Music] a home for the presence of the Lord let my life now be separated that I might be what I was born a tiny simple stable all beaten at one [Music] didn't take something special to reveal his majesty so I know if I give him control he'll be born at me let your word be more in the manger of my heart [Music] live inside this house [Music] [Music] not much to behold hardly the place for his words and let him have his way from Glory unto Glory he'll change me day by day [Music] by [Music] day let your word be more in the manger [Music] let your word be born in the manger of my heart live inside this house [Music] word before maker [Music] oh let the book live in your me myself within Thy word show me my self and show me my savior at the world let the book [Music] the book [Music] oh let the world live show me myself everything everything and show me my savior then [Music] [Music] so keep your mind [Music] stayed on thee these days [Music] give you perfect peace sweet release [Music] stay it up please release [Music] [Music] just keep your mind stayed on you know just keep your mind [Music] stayed on me stand on me Faithfully [Music] God will give you perfect peace sweet [Music] breathe if you'll just keep your mind [Music]
