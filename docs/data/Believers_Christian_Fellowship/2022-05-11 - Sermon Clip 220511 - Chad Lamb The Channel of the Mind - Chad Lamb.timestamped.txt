[0:00] now what if god would send his message
[0:02] by an angel to mary and said hail mary
[0:05] blessed art thou amongst women you're
[0:07] going to have a baby knowing no man she
[0:09] said now wait a minute here let me take
[0:12] you down to the laboratory and you tell
[0:13] me let the doctor prove to me just how
[0:15] i'm going to do this
[0:17] then i'll believe you it would never
[0:19] happen but what did she what what did
[0:21] she come to the womb of her heart the
[0:23] womb of her spirit the womb of her
[0:25] spirit is your mind your mind is a
[0:28] channel so i want you to catch that your
[0:31] mind is a channel and that's what god
[0:33] was using as gabriel was speaking unto
[0:36] mary he was using the channel of her
[0:38] mind amen to unlock the faith that was
[0:41] laying down in her because she was
[0:42] predestinated to bring forth that virgin
[0:45] seed amen the seed of the woman from
[0:47] before the foundation of the world
[0:49] remember that that faith had to be
[0:51] unlocked amen and we know that it had to
[0:54] do with mary's faith because when she
[0:56] went to go visit elizabeth amen she gave
[0:59] a salutation her salutation caused that
[1:02] baby the leap in the womb of elizabeth
[1:04] and elizabeth began to prophesy and as
[1:06] elizabeth began to prophesy amen he says
[1:09] she begins to say something on the order
[1:12] of because these things shall be
[1:14] performed in you because you believed
[1:18] because you believe these things will be
[1:21] performed because you believed amen
[1:23] because everything in the kingdom of god
[1:25] operates by faith amen
[1:27] so the these things that the angel told
[1:30] you they're not happening because the
[1:31] angel told you they're happening because
[1:34] you believe what the angel told you
[1:37] amen because it requires faith but faith
[1:40] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[1:42] god amen so god is using our senses to
[1:46] bring in us amen the quickening power
[1:48] amen to bring the word and then when the
[1:50] words receive the spirit comes on top of
[1:52] the word which is quickening power to
[1:54] make the word live and because you
[1:56] believe it'll be done according to your
[1:59] faith
[2:01] praise god
[2:02] so mary had to receive and believe the
[2:05] angel's message
