the ministering Brothers here they surprised me Wednesday night uh met me in my office with a little surprise and they they bought for me the suit that I'm wearing today and they gave it to me Wednesday night so God bless you Brothers we love you all and appreciate you so much and and and so I pray that God would help me to make good use of it amen and use it for the glory of his kingdom amen God bless you all also while we're standing at before we read the scripture I just want to give a big thanks to brother Donovan and sister Stephanie fiser for last Sunday they coordinated the uh kids service put everything together and worked on that I know they had several helping them so thank you all it was really wonderful it was a lot of fun I always enjoy being with the kids so big thank you to them as well and also Wednesday night I didn't have a title you know so I I suggested that everybody text I got some really good ideas that was so much fun I'm thinking about doing it every once in a while just to see what I get amen so that was that was fun we might start comp competitions and who does the best and no but it was fun and we appreciate the feedback that was good so God bless you also want to let you know that we have communion and feet washing this afternoon and so we'll announce that again at the end of service uh while we're standing let's turn to the Book of Genesis Genesis chapter 1 in Genesis CH 1 we'll read verse 26- 28 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Jesus that you have brought us together again and we're once again so grateful Lord for this privilege this opportunity you've granted us to come and worship you together with our brothers and sisters to hear your word and God may you just come and take control now take absolute control over this vessel of mine God I want to yield as much as I know how into your hand so that you can speak through a gift you've placed in a vessel of clay God we have no confidence in the flesh but we have confidence in your method your way your word so we come in obedience to that God we're aware of the frailties we're aware of all the pitfalls and handicaps that is in flesh but yet this is your method and we trust it Lord God we trust that you'll keep us by your grace that you'll feed us as your lambs and we've come to receive that word Lord that portion for today May you feed us may you make yourself evident through the the breaking of bread may you give us strength for our journey we love you we ask that you bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you as you have your seats praise the Lord so I've got on my heart a big subject I've been meditating on and I've got I I'm I'm really full and I don't think we'll get through it all today and it may be a couple parts but we'll just see how it goes um but I'd like to to speak on the subject the unveiling of the the amateur Gods the unveiling of the amateur gods and that's quite a mouthful for a title but I hope God will help us just to uh break it down and and and just demonstrate what's on our heart and so uh I want to read a a quote out of the breach the breach message when brother Benham come to preach the seals he starts with God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same then he comes to the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and in the breach he says and when he lost his life he also lost in his inheritance in life he's speaking of Adam now because he had completely Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God's the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to see but when he did that he lost his inheritance now Adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and it would do it Adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and planted over there it would do it for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God Amen so because he was a Son of God he was a minor God and brother Brenham uses the term and we'll get to it in a minute amateur God so amateur God or minor God and he uses them uh interchangeably these terms but but you know uh hold on I just want to write something down here before it leaves my mind you know brother brandom said uh 25 years ago he goes I used to hold those scriptures in my mind just go right through them but now I got to write well now I can't even hold it for 5 minutes anymore so I just got to stop and write it around amen so I used to just ignore that and think oh it'll come back but I'm I realized I can't ignore that the curse of age is still real amen so now he he says he's a uh a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God so the that's the position of the sons of God would to be minor gods or children of God and we've been through this exercise before uh any child any offspring of a species is the same species so The Offspring of a dog is a dog The Offspring of a cat is a cat what is The Offspring of God amen amen that's why the Bible calls us children of God children of light all of the these things because we we are intended to be the the children of God and that's what Adam was and as the first Son of God that was created in this creation here in Genesis he demonstrated what it was to be a Son of God he was G he was placed in a position of dominion he was told to have dominion and subdue the Earth and all creation and bring it under his Dominion because he was a king he was a god upon the Earth amen so let's go to Genesis chapter 2 now now Genesis 2 verse 15 Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that you eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and the Lord God God said unto said it is not good that man shall be alone I will make him a help meat for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meate for him so we find in the nature of Adam as the Son of God as the god over the Earth he was he was uh going to be formed in the likeness of God in the image of God and we know as the prophet taught us he started off in in a spirit form and then the spirit was made into a flesh form so he could interact with the creation because he was going to be a God over that creation so he came into the form of the creation so they could interact with their God and and now uh God is going to find a help meat for him so what he does is he brings up every creature out of the earth and brings them and presents them to Adam and now Adam is naming the creatures it's not it's not God naming the creatures is Adam naming the creatures because Adam is the god of the earth so we see the Dominion that he has we see we we also see the the um we also see the uh the confidence that God has in his son as God brings every animal to Adam to name and whatever Adam named him that was the name that thereof so this is a big statement now we realize when we read the Bible we we've been through this so many times cuz the prophet of God unlocks the the Bible for us he says God condenses his truth I mean he packs it in but it means so much every little word every jot every TT amen it's packed full of meaning amen so that's why he told us we have to read between the lines or we have to catch the context or or he said sometimes put on your spiritual jackets I mean he wants us to pay attention to everything here and so when whatever Adam Nam to animals that was the name thereof meaning that whatever he had the authority to declare what this is to Define what this is and a name is more than just a name it's also a placing right all right so so Adam would have to know uh uh I would he we know Adam was a prophet he lays down a prophecy and when a man leaves his father and mother and Cleaves to his wife that was a prophecy and so we know he's a Son of God he his prophetic insight and now he's naming all the animals and and it's not just I don't I don't perceive it this way that the naming of animals was just trivial whatever you know whatever whim he got but he was actually placing creation as he was naming the animals he was he was naming them according to characteristics that they possessed and and in naming them according to the C characteristics he identify he was positionally placing them so he was the god of the earth placing the creation amen and God had this confidence in his son to do that and so he would have to do it with prophetic Insight he would have to do it knowing the mind of God because he would have to be in the nature of God to place it the way God wanted it place because he can't get it out of kilter according to God's word which is original thought amen so we see this is a mighty position that Adam's in it's not trivial it's not light-hearted it's not asking a 5-year-old what you want to call this or what do you want to name your your puppy it's not that kind of naming all right and so then there was a help meet found for him which we know is foreshadowing the the whole Plan of Redemption where where the the his bride was in him and came out from him and was United back together but we want to talk about this now he is in the realm of the word operating as God over the Earth he's an amateur God or a minor God under his father God cuz he's a Son of God and he's in position and everything's in position and everything's held in position as long as the Son of God stays with the word of God but it began to lose its position when the Son of God left the word of God so it goes to show amen that if I could if I could just share what's on my heart because I don't even know how to explain it all we're just trusting in God to help amen it shows that we we can make big claims and boastful claims that we're the children of God we're the sons of God we're this and we're the bride and we're that but but you realized that even a Son of God when he left the word of God Amen was was knocked out of his position as a minor God he didn't keep that position just because he was a Son of God he kept that position because he was a Son of God staying behind the word of God and even when the Son of God left the word of God he lost his position right amen so this is really important because the day and the age that we live in amen because of the tremendous Revelation that came to us if we get the wrong thinking behind that revelation we start to believe that that we are children of God and sons of God and that's wonderful to believe we need to receive that Revelation but if that Revelation puts us in a position to where we can ignore work around reject the word of God we may still be some and Daughters of God but we are not going to be in our position that God has called us to in this day we'll be knocked out like Adam was knocked out now although Adam was knocked out of position amen he was still a Son of God and God came down himself as the father and offered a lamb to pay the price of redemption and clothed him in the clothes Amen to start the work of restoration amen so it wasn't as though he he was no longer a Son of God but he was now a fallen Son of God outside of his position and no no longer an amateur God but he was still a Son of God and so we're finding all the way back from the beginning how critical it is to stay with God's word he's from the very from the very word go he starts off with this this whole premise that we must stay with the word that our our our staying in position amen has to do with staying in position with the word amen Amen brother B says in the message adoption from 1960 he said the word means in Hebrew the self-existent all by himself nothing exists before him he was the all existent there ever was self-existent one Ella Ella Elohim means the all sufficient all powerful allmighty self-existent one but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am Jehova uh uh yeah Jehovah what did he mean I am the all existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine so he's showing now in the transition of titles Amen brother brandom if you understand what he's saying here he's not actually giving you an accurate definition like you would go to the concordance and get a definition and he's not even uh declaring it uh uh I I could say this way in the sequence of events what he's giving you is the overarching understanding that was Elohim the self-existing and God who dwelt all alone but when he began to bring Offspring upon the Earth amen he changed now he's the S Jehovah means the self-existent one amen who reveals himself amen and so now as he's bringing Sons upon the Earth amen he he's he's displaying uh more attributes of himself amen he's unveiling himself and here's how the prophet says it he says uh I am the all existing one who has created something off myself to be a son of mine you can't find in the concordance that's not what it says in the concordance but that's exactly what it is that's the reality of the Revelation behind what you find in the concordance see this is what a prophet can do especially a prophet with only a seventh grade education because he doesn't have to stay hindered by intellectual methods of having a proper uh definition or even Hebrew and all of that Amen brother B goes to the Hebrew goes to the Greek he does all of that because what's he trying to do he's trying to find out the meaning behind it the understanding not just the definition but the understanding so that's what he's bringing us here I'm the all- existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary amateur little one of mine that's what brother B say is the definition of Jehovah amen you get in a discussion with a theologian and you start quoting your definition he's going to look at you like like where did you get that amen so he's showing that God wanted to unveil himself he would he wanted to be more than just the self-existing one who dwelt alone amen so he created something off of himself to be a son of his or an amateur little one of mine he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made man an amate God so he isn't self-existence anymore he exists with his family amen Ella Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family there's another definition Jehovah means the one who exist with his family amen praise God also not in the concordance if you take the intellectual understanding but when the eyes of your faith are open and you go to concordance you're like I see what it means that's exactly right brother benam amen the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his Dominion he was a God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so and there he is god Jehovah the one the the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him there you are Amen brother said God's original desire was to have an earth inhabited with sons and daughters and those Sons and Daughters would all be the children of God and they would all be uh operate in a operation of the word by faith in the word amen and they would be Gods upon the Earth having dominion and so let's go back to Genesis 2 verse one Genesis 2 verse1 says thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which he had created and made brother M because and gives us so much Insight on the word he says why was it that God rested on the seventh day because on the seventh day he turned Dominion of his creation over to his son and his son's wife and that's why God went and took his rest because now he had reflected himself in a son upon the Earth and that son was a minor God or an amateur God underneath father God and he had God had made a creation upon the Earth and then he had placed a portion of himself on that Earth in flesh and that was Adam and he had given dominion and rulership and Reign unto Adam so now because God had a reflection of him himself on Earth keeping everything according to the word he could go and and rest because now his son was in charge praise God Amen but W brother man said while he was resting so in the seventh day while he was resting there was a deception that came up and the woman was beguiled by the serpent she was deceived and it's amazing the terminology that the serpent uses because he starts to ask questions about the word hey yeah has God said you may eat of all the trees and she says yeah we can eat of them all except this one of the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil and forgive me I'm just paraphrasing but he he he said that uh he says uh but no that's not true he said God does know said you'll not surely die but God does know in that day you eat thereof that day you should be as Gods knowing good and evil and it's so sad but he tried to sell them something that they didn't need cuz they were already Gods upon the Earth but he was trying to give them another position or a higher position or something else showed them that there was more to attain to something that you're limited in now this understanding if you have this understanding you'll be as Gods upon the Earth knowing good and evil and that wasn't God's position for them to be God's knowing good and evil his position for them was to be God's knowing good why I told him to stay away from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but stay with the Tree of Life which which is good so so now he he begins to sell him this and she takes the word and takes the false word and leaves the word and as she leaves the word to fall and Adam knowing what he was doing but he goes to his wife out with his wife in order to save his wife he leaves the word when he left the word he lost his position as amateur God he still remained a Son of God but he lost his position as amateur God so so we find that's that was the case in the beginning brother bam in the message why says a man was made to be God to be a God so what was the original purpose in creation of man he was made to be a god do you know that he's in the image of God he's a Son of God he's like him he was given a do a domain Genesis 1:26 dominion over the whole earth that's right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God made like God had hands and feet like God he was in the image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's word it sent him right back out to shift for himself now listen now God's trying to bring him back amen what is the what what is the Plan of Redemption what is the whole Bible for it's to bring us back to this picture of Eden now God is trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit when you begin to become a Son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you so now God is trying to bring him back man fell but God's trying to bring him back why did God leave his rest he left his rest amen because the work that he had done and completed was now fallen because left the word and now could no longer serve the original purpose so now he starts remaking his Masterpiece he starts working AO taking what had fallen down and he starts rebuilding again and he rebuilds to the Old Testament until he comes to that Capstone the head of the old which is Jesus Christ and flesh and then use the fullness of the word made bodily and then now from his side he takes a wife what's he doing he's reconstructing his Masterpiece family from the Garden of Eden and he's doing it through the entire scripture so that the whole scripture has one purpose one goal one desire that God wanted to achieve and what's he trying to do he's trying to bring his offspring back to their position as amateur Sons and Daughters of God Amen how has he done it through his never changing method by his word amen amen so now my this was history this was a history lesson now let's come up to today when he's when I'm looking at the unveiling of the sons of God when we know that God's Plan of Redemption was to bring Sons and Daughters of God back to their position as amateur gods or minor Gods we know that we live in the day that God is finishing his work of redemption we're in the last days brother I made it so clear this is the end time the seven seal is the end time seal it's the ending of all things said this is the end time and so he went from like we've been talking about for the last several weeks he went from saying is this the sign of the end s to start asking what time is it sir he started saying is this the sign of the end s good question but I he the question was satisfied for him but he still asked the question what time is it sir so you can draw your own conclusion amen let's go to John chapter 10 now when we see the plan of God and when we take a uh like we say bird's eye view but if we leave the Earthly carnal things and we fly high into the heavenlies through the eagle anointing that's been presented in this day that can lift us up and we we're not looking at the forest with all the individual trees but we're now flying high to see the lands ape the whole landscape and how everything fits together amen we we realize what God had done originally what his original intent and purpose was in creating man where man fell for that what God has done to restore it and where God's taking men back to we've got this whole perspective of this whole image that came by the message of the hour to help us to understand what the real purpose is and we understand the purpose in this day this is not listen the purpose in our day is not for us just to barely get SA saved and hope that we make it that's not God's purpose in the end time because what he's trying to do is restore back his children his offspring to a position that they lost amen and he's working to bring us back into that position by his word amen they lost the position by the word so God will restore it by the word amen in John chap 10: 30 Jesus says I and my father are one then when the Jews took up stones again to Stone him Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from the father for which of these Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy because thou thou being a man makest thyself God so they thought that was one of the most horrible things you could say because you being a man maketh yourself God cuz you said my father and I are one and so they wanted to Stone him saying blasphemy nobody can say anything like that but Jesus is about ready to let them know that that's not blasphemy that's the scriptures amen see in some ways it seems too far-fetched for Humanity we we're born in sin shap in iniquity come into the world speaking lies we know our Frailty we know our Humanity we know what hybridization has done to us we face it on a daily basis we're very well aware of our Frailty and our weaknesses amen but if we if we keep looking at Frailty and weaknesses only we're going to miss what God is doing in this day because through the Frailty and weaknesses and all all the uh the the error that we have mixed in with us genetically and and on our thinking amen through all of that God has provided something that'll lift his children out of that condition and that is his word amen because he did it by the spoken word in the original he created by the spoken word he he brought forth Adam by the spoken word he positionally placed him by the spoken word and everything ran perfect under God's spoken word made material until man left the word and then God started Redemption again but at the end of redemption he's bringing back the fullness of the word to bring a people back under the banner of the word to bring his children back to Sons and Daughters of God so it seems farfetched amen It seems impossible it seems like how you being a man make it yourself God of course we've got to kill you nobody can do that and here's Jesus's response verse 34 Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods if I called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say you of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou Blasphemous because I said I am the Son of God he's going right to the scripture and says what does the scripture say let's go to Psalms 82 Psalms 82 and verse 6 he says I have said ye are gods and all of you are Children of the most high Jesus was quoting back to them the scriptures is that right let's go to Exodus chapter 7 this is God calling Moses and commissioning Moses to go and he says in Exodus 7 verse one there Exodus 7 1 and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet listen there was an amateur God in Egypt in the form of a prophet CU a prophet had the mind of God and had the word of God for that day and he was there and and and and he in Egypt they had a minor God and he was to be a God to Pharaoh amen oh my goodness what a what a statement friends so here comes Jesus claiming that he's the son of God and he and his father are one and now the Jews want to take up stones to Stone him and Jesus is saying why are you so troubled about this don't you even know what the Bible says doesn't the Bible says ye are all sons of God to whom the word of the Lord came to they are Gods amen how how how can you condemn me because I say I'm the Son of God Amen he was never outside the word amen he was just outside their carnal thinking never outside the word or the purpose of God but he was so foreign to the common conceptions of man and the ideas of man Hey listen we're living in the same kind of phase in life amen the carnal idea the carnal understanding amen is so far away amen from the from the uh the the things of God the things of God are so much higher his ways are higher than our ways now when when I start when I start preaching this way there's a there's a a desire in me to be cautious and not because I'm worried about this Revelation it's the truth but the the the pride in man will ruin this beautiful truth the arrogance and humanity and the pride of man will take this but if you want to look at our example in Jesus Christ when he was the last Adam or brother call him the second Adam he was the restoration of the Son of God with dominion over the Earth that was lost Lo he comes back to the Earth as the restoration of the Masterpiece and when he's on Earth amen he has dominion over nature amen he can speak to the storm he can break bread he can he can speak to the waves he can do all these things he can raise the dead he has Dominion is the Son of God upon the Earth he's the son of God and he's and he's reclaiming back what Adam lost and he's manifesting the things that Adam lost and and and as he's doing it amen he he's claiming I'm the Son of God he's not claiming it but they're perceiving he's saying I and my father are one he starts talking about his father is gone and they start to understand this is the Son of God and the divine revelation comes to Peter he knows that thou art Christ the son of the Living God and here he is amen but look at his life amen there's no arrogancy there's no Pride there's no there's no uh there's no abuse you understand what I'm saying one thing that'll destroy this beauti beautiful gospel truth is if we take this truth and we filter it through humanity and we then we start to make claims that we are amateur gods and we're God and we start doing these things and when you mix in Pride and arrogancy what you start to do is you start to reproduce an arrogant nature and how could a Son of God Amen have an arrogant nature that's not what God wants to manifest he wants to manifest his word amen not his word hybridized with our our nature then we're off the word again so we're claiming the promise that's for this day but we claim the promise for this day mixed with a hybrid nature and represent a hybrid word then all of a sudden that's not the promise for this day like technically the words can be right but the manifestation is wrong so now it's hybrid word amen and listen friends I don't I I I don't have the Cure The Cure is the word of God and the spirit of God to bring it to pass I believe God's growing us into the right manifestation we can look and say how am I ever going to get this right without hybriding it God's going to get it right all he needs is yielded vessels who will continually surrender and allow the abrasion of the word to keep working them down and working them down and working them down till they fit the image of God Amen there's a lot of rough places that need knocked off but God's got a good tool to knock it off and that's the word that's been restored through this message is here to shape us into Sons and Daughters of God to come back into our position that's why all the preaching can't feel good if it all feels good then we're not being molded we're not being shaped amen some of it needs to feel rough it's got to be a little bit abrasive to our human nature not abrasive to the inside nature but abrasive to the outside nature it should ring in harmony with the Inside Man but the outside man may be like oh my goodness amen so when we when we talk about this glorious truth that's being restored in our day amen we got to realize that as Jesus was the son of God he was the example he was the bridegroom tree the example tree he was the manifestation of the fullness of the word made flesh and that that man in that position amen he never exerted his own will he never worked in disobedience he only did that which the father showed him showing that a that Son of God in the manifestation of the restoration of the Son of God upon Earth was absolutely surrendered to the will of God and took no mind of his own but took the mind of his father so that he would accurately display the word God he was a Son of God oh praise God when brother B said in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light now in all ages God has set for so much of his word for each age God always sends somebody that the word can get into and show the light of it that's every age it does the same thing always does that he was the Fulfillment as I said of all the Divine holy powers of the prophets they were minor Gods when the word of the Lord came to a man Jesus said himself that he was a God you know that if your law said that your fathers back there called them uh who the word of God came to called them Gods how can you condemn me saying when I said I am the son of that God when the very God himself who spoke the word through the prophets he was the manifestation of that spoken word and if the prophet was called a God because he was the manifestation of another prophet's word how can you condemn him when he was the same thing he was the son of God as he shall be called The Son of God so this re itating again that Jesus Took back that position and he came as a human being in flesh Amen to take back that position that Adam fell from but he did so by staying with the word of God now staying with the word of God also has a nature that goes with it amen we're not talking technical terms that we can catch the technical terms and miss the life that still doesn't work yeah and so it's not about technical terms it's about coming back under the umbrella of the word it's coming back behind the word and and start to manifest that word that's been restored which will manifest a certain character amen that's what Jesus did they they that they come to Jesus and said show us the father and he says have I been so long with you that you don't know me when you've seen me you've seen the father why he was an exact replication on Earth and flesh of the father he was the he was the father in flesh he was God manifest In the Flesh and he says when you've seen me you've seen the father amen because he was reflecting back the father because he didn't take his own thinking he didn't take his own desires he surrendered it all amen and only did that which the father showed him that was the restoration back amen so now when we want to see now we've seen the unveiling in Jesus Christ of the Son of God but what about the unveiling of us as sons of of God because the sons of God it's been a mystery listen there's been a mystery down through time amen things were supposed to just come the right way if we say it that way things were supposed to came and the original uh the original command of God Amen Adam and Eve would reproduced another Son of God and reproduced another Son of God and reproduced the daughter of God until there was a god race upon the Earth though God would have replicated himself as a family upon the Earth it would have lived in harmony according to the word and amen but but now amen that was broken and after that was broken there was another seed sewn in and now there was a mingled seed upon the earth and the wheat and tears were sewed together and remember you have to wait till the Harvest time to sort out which is which so there's been a confusion all the way through from seed sewing time in Genesis to harvest time in Revelation amen there's been a confusion in this field of the earth is what is God's and what is not Gods what was sown by the son of man what was sown by the enemy amen amen so we understand this is the picture of the Bible this is the parable Jesus gives himself so now there's a confusion all the way through but he says wait till Harvest Time in the Harvest time it'll put forth its fruit and then you will be able to discern which is which how many believe this is Harvest Time this is Harvest Time where God once again is going to unveil the sons of God Amen which are tears and which are wheat amen and this isn't listen I I I I I'm so caution within myself as a human being but the Revelation is so strong down inside of me that God in this day is going to declare what is wheed and what is tears and he's got a method for declaring it and he's going to declare it he's going to show it it's going to manifest itself cuz this is the age that he wants to manifest in and it's not so you and I can pick up some terminology and say I'm wheat I'm an eagle I'm bride you can say anything you want the words don't mean anything what the reality is is the life that's down behind that there's got to be a real son or daughter of God down in the soul a seed Gene of God that comes to life under the anointing of the word of this age that Springs that to life and is Anointed by the spirit of God to manifest that life so it's not so we can pick up a term intellectually and just start repeating it and making ourselves feel good because we can say it we can say it loud and we can say it bold and we can say it often yes because if it all it took was having an intellectual understanding uh of these things and being able to Proclaim it the Pharisees would have had it they could follow their lineage back they knew the Old Testament they knew what the word said they they believed in some fashion the word to Moses uh they couldn't believe all of it we understand but in some carnal way they had an understanding of what Moses was doing and the separation of Abraham and and down through Isaac and then Jacob and then the 12 sons making the tribes that God would choose and they could find themselves in that part of the word amen and they come forth as a propagation naturally and they believe that they were the sons and daughters of God they believe that they were amen the the the chosen of God but when the fullness of time had come to bring the last Adam on the earth amen the manifestation of the last adom exposed or unveiled who the sons of God really were and who they weren't sir amen John chapter 8 let's turn there together please John chapter 8 verse 39 he's having a dialogue with some of these religious Jews and in John 8:39 he says they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto him if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham that's really important if you're Abraham's children now remember why is this so important because it's so important because the promise was to Abraham and to his seed that's who the pro God gave an unconditional Covenant of Grace and a promise to Abraham and to Abraham's seed so the Covenant of Grace goes with Abraham and his seed so it's important to be Seed of Abraham that's very very important because if you're a child of Abraham if you're the Seed of Abraham then you're part of the unconditional Covenant of Grace God amen amen so that's what they wanted to be so when they say uh uh they said unto him Abraham is our father what they're saying is is we are the children of God we are the elect we are part of the program right and Jesus says to them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham he makes it really easy if you Abraham's children you would pick up his nature because that's what Offspring do they pick up the nature of their parents that's why Cain responded to Cain to God the way he did and that's why Abel could offer a sacrifice because they picked up the nature of their parents of their father and so now he's saying if Abraham were your father you would have picked up the nature of Abraham because you pick up the nature of your father oh this is good if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham now look at what he says next you do the Deeds of your father he just said Abraham's not your father you got another father why because you picked up the nature of your father now he goes on he says you do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God why did they say it this way they understood serpent seed and they said we have one father even God where are they going they're going all the way back to Adam Adam was a Son of God so Adam was a Son of God and coming down the line and Abraham Abraham was a Son of God and the promises were Abraham so now they want Abraham to be their father when he says no you have another father they say wait a minute we're not born of that fornication we have one father even God now Jesus is going to address this 42 Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me praise God let's read 43 and 44 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it my goodness when he starts to break down the attributes of the father we of Abraham say if you're Abraham you would do the works of Abraham if Cain was of Adam he would have received Revelation on the word of God but because Abel was of that lineage and Cain was of the wicked one amen Cain could not receive amen not only could he not receive a revelation of the word he couldn't even submit to the Commandment of the Lord because he says your father was a murderer from the beginning who was murdering in the beginning of time as we know in Genesis it was Cain murdered his brother Abel why did he murder Abel because Abel had the truth he did not he murdered his brother and his brother was only living out fleshing out the revelation of the word that was given for him and now they want to kill Jesus just like Cain wanted to kill Abel and what was Jesus doing he was just living out the revelation of the word amen that was all he was doing he was doing what Abel was doing they were doing what Cain was doing showing what progeny thereof praise God Amen Jesus started to peel it away he says if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me so now if we want to be Seed of Abraham because that's where the promise lays then we have to do the works of Abraham and if we're children of God we would believe him we would love him what does it mean to love him what what was Jesus standing there that day he was the word made flesh he was the word of God the concept the thought of God that was spoken out manifest all made into a flesh body one man Jesus Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the word of God made flesh and he says if you were a child of God you would love me because I proceeded forth and came from God listen the word Christ came from God the children of God would love him today just like they should have loved him that day praise God let's go to 2 Thessalonians now we want to start to break this down as the unveiling of the sons of gone and when I come to the unveiling of the sons of God I'm not going to start with manifestations because we believe in true manifestations but there's also brother B said anything that that any manifestation God can do the devil can copy so there needs to be something else to unveil the sons of God 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 9 even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a liee that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness so judgment is going to come because they had not a love for the truth Jesus told the Pharisees if God were your father you would love me he was the truth the life and the way he was the truth of God and he says if God were your father you would love me for you would love the truth because I proceeded and came forth out of God I didn't come of myself but he sent me so now they didn't love the truth when the truth was made manifest before them and he recognized you don't love me you don't love the truth amen because you're not God is not your father if God were your father you would love me if Abraham were your father you would do what Abraham did amen but you do the works of your father which is of a different lineage altogether and so now he's showing that these there there's coming a people who have not a love of the truth and because they have not a love of the truth he shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they might be damned by it amen they they why because they didn't have a love of the truth that was the differentiating point let's go back to Jude back towards the Book of Revelation Jude 1 verse5 Jude 1 and5 I will therefore put you in remembrance though you know these you know this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of of Egypt afterward destroyed them that beli not so so follow my follow follow this train following these scriptures there was a people who had not a love of the truth so he gave them and sent them strong delusion that they'd be a lie and be damned by it because they didn't have a love of the truth we talk to the Pharisees because they didn't love him and he was the truth he knew where their father was now there's a people that he saved out of Egypt and those people that he saved out of Egypt were his chosen people he chose them he selected them he rescued them he redeemed them he brought them out of Egypt amen but along the way amen they condemned themselves and they perished who perished who was destroyed those that believe not so the ones that believed not were separated from the program of God who of that original that came out got to go into the promise of God it was two who believe the full word of God am amen it was Joshua and Caleb who could take God out his word and say hey when when they cross over and they begin to spy out the land and they saw amen the great feats that the people in the land had done and the mighty armies and the walled cities and the Giants amen they looked at it carnally and naturally amen they got afraid they were scared that they could not overcome and they came and they brought back an evil report amen the evil report was against the word word because God says I will bring you into a land I will I will drive out the inhabitants I will I will I will I will God told them the promise and what he was going to do for them when they got to the promised land and they sent the spies across they saw how difficult and how insurmountable and how incapable they were and they come back and say we be not able but there was two people who could stay with the word of God and those two were Joshua and Caleb and say hey we be we're more than able to take them they're but bread for us if God before us what were they believing they were believing the word of God that came through that prophet in their day they had accepted the word proving that they were children of God but who was destroyed those that believe not amen listen they believed a lot think about the ones who were destroyed they believed that God parted the Red Sea they believe that Mana Came From Heaven they believe that the smitten rock produced water water yes they believed all of that but when it got time to cross over and they come to the difficult the the difficult task that lay ahead of them they disbelieved that part of the word and when they disbelieved they were cut out of the economy of God amen amen amen the Pharisees believed a whole lot that was written in the Bible but when it came time for the Fulfillment of the promise they didn't believe the Fulfillment of the promise that was before their eyes now remember we're talking about the unveiling of the sons of God the unveiling of the amateur Gods Hebrews chapter 3 let's turn there together please Hebrews chapter 3 let's look at verse 14 for it for while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the the provocation the the the provocation is a story we just talked about when they provoked God by not believing the word and not wanting to cross over and take the lamb Harden not your heart is in the provocation for some when they heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief remember how brother brandham tells us that the only real Sin there is is unbelief said unbelief in what unbelief in the word of God what did they have what did these spies have in the rest of the nation when they rose up in a bitter cry amen at the at the at the testimony of the the 10 false Witnesses amen they they cried out and wanted to go back to Egypt and all that amen they they they were cut out he was displeased with them because they provoked him in the wilderness by what by not believing his promised word when they come face to face with it they did not believe it amen and so now they were kept out of the promise who was kept out of the promise those that didn't believe now now listen close this is what I want to drive down to it wasn't the ones who were vile and wicked and nasty and had a temper and and didn't always do what Moses said he cut them out because they were hard to deal with that wasn't how he differentiated who went in and who didn't go in and he didn't he didn't take Joshua and Caleb because they were always nice to their neighbor and they said sweet things and they took care of their mom really well he that's that was never the differentiating point that was not the deciding factor but it came down to the basis of faith and unbelief the separation line was faith and unbelief amen the the the the whether you went in or not who didn't go in those that didn't believe what didn't they believe they didn't believe this portion of the word there was others they could claim to believe there was others they acted and participated in but they didn't accept this truth that God was going to give that land to them when they saw all the unsurmountable odds and they provoked God unto wrath amen and he rejected them and he said they're not going to go in they will not go in and they everyone died in the wilderness but there was two who went in not because they were nicest and better looking and more intelligent that wasn't the basis the basis for them entering in when the others were rejected is because said if God before us were're more than able they're but bread for us cuz we believe what Moses said all the way back in Egypt come from God and it's nothing but the truth those are the two that went in it's not Good Conduct amen it's not bad conduct it's faith and in belief in the promised word of God and when I say that I feel like I have to qualify my statements because the more people hear you say something the more questions you have listen it doesn't mean that you don't going to have righteous acts and righteous Deeds amen that's the outcropping of Faith amen if you have faith genuine faith in the word of God you will obey the word of God and when you get off the word of God you'll repent and come back in line with the word of God you understand we're not saying act any way you want you're going to go in any ways that's fine no that's a very clear indication that you don't believe the word of God if you trample over it so lightly and esteem it so little but conduct is not the base faith is the basis this is how God unveils his seedline this is how God has always unveiled his seed line from the beginning to the end he has always used the measuring stick of faith in the present manifestation of the word that has been from the days of Noah Abraham Noah Moses all the way down through the basis has always been faith in present truth am in Noah's day you could believe the story of creation 100% you could believe the fall of Man you can believe Adam's sin you can believe the creation of the woman you can believe all of that that was fine but to dis believe Noah's message was death cuz you weren't on the boat because that boat was the manifested word of God and it was life and it was the only place of life amen man and you can say oh that that's harsh that's not harsh that's Grace God s God looked down and saw that all the Deeds of men were evil and his heart was continually and evil and God was grieved that he had made man and he was going to wipe them off the Earth amen but he decided to have favor upon one man and through that one man he would open a door of mercy and grace through that one man that was the grace of God that wasn't anything harsh that wasn't anything hateful that wasn't anything mean amen the message of the hour in Noah's day was the greatest Grace the world had ever seen cuz every one of them deserved death amen but God had provided a way of life amen amen and we look at that through Modern Leo Dean mentality and you think well how that's not fair that's not not fair you should have done this and you should have done that why do they have to listen to Noah Noah was a you know Noah may have been a little bit grumpy and on edge once in a while and he may not have been particularly handsome and he may not have had the smoothest speaking voice and you know they kind of got tired of Noah's message because he preached the same thing over and over for 120 years yesall so he may not have been the most charismatic he may not have the most charismatic message and they may not have had the biggest church and and you know how is that fair what if there's other sincere people there was other people who loved God there was other people who wanted this and that but but listen God had looked down and man was Fallen man had corrupted himself and man's desire was continually on evil amen man was deserving of death they had left the word of God forsaken the word of God taken their own lustful desires went their own way and God was just and righteous in every way to wipe them out amen but God sent a prophet with a message and that message was a message of life and mercy Redemption forgiveness amen listen if you got on that boat it didn't matter how vile you were the day before if you got on that boat you lived if you refused to get on that boat didn't matter how nice you were how many Good Deeds you did and how many people's lives you saved and how much money you had given to the poor if you didn't get on that boat you were lost listen this isn't something new this is the way the word has always been when God's own son Adam violated the word of God God sent him out of the G Garden according to his promised word man this is the way it's always been these are not new Concepts this is the reality yes this is the method by which God has already always divided the wheat and the tears this is where he's always divided the righteous from the unrighteous he didn't use deeds he used faith I mean let let's just think about this for a minute David king of Israel called by God Anointed with by a prophet positioned amen by the will of God he did one of the most V things that a human being can do he took another man's wife and then tried to cover it and hide it by having the man killed and I mean it was it was shameful and he used other people to do his dirty work it was a shameful vile degradating piece of of human human work of humanity and it was horrible and there was a judgment that came the spanking came God corrected it God sent a prophet to correct it but that act did not change who David was David was still a man after goat's own heart did horrible horrible things but when God when God sent a prophet to come his way amen he recognize that prophet in the word of God and he says it's me I'm the man and I'm guilty and immediately God says and God has put away your sin immediately through that Prophet immediately says and God has put away your sin Grace amen listen it's it's faith in the word of God let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 it's got a few more places that I want to read this and show this Hebrews chapter 11 in Hebrews 11:30 says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about 7even Days by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace does anybody know what rahab's occupation was Rahab was a harlot but when the spies came to her place she was willing to hide them because she believed all that she had heard said we have heard about your God we have heard what they did at the Red Sea we have heard and she believed and it says listen she received the spies she hid the spies she believed the message of the spies she believed the word for her day she believed what moses' message was she believed the crossing of the Red Sea she believed God was with these people and that she was taking them to the promise she believed the word for her day amen and she was a prostitute Harlot amen vile amen you couldn't match her life to another life and say she's righteous amen but it said but by faith by what belief by faith believing by faith the Harlot I I'm so glad that we're in Hebrews chap 11 The Heroes of Faith and the title she has is the Harlot Rahab I think God wants us to catch something here and her title is the Harlot Rahab the Harlot Rahab perish not perish not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace what saved her faith by faith Rahab perish not with them that believe not what did God use to differentiate between everybody else in Jericho and Rahab in her house it was her faith amen everybody else believed not and everybody who believed not perished why because this message that Moses was packing was the word for that day and when this Gentile Harlot outside the economy of God with an unrighteous life when she believed it confessed it and acted upon it God saved her from the destruction that was coming amen let's go to Hebrews 11:6 he says Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him there's no that's why Works won't work good deeds won't work niceties won't work and all of those things are good like we should have all those when I say things like that I'm not belittling any of that I want you to be nice especially when you're talking to me be super nice and I want to be super nice to you we want to be nice to our neighbors we want to be good people we want to be a good representation of the word but the reality is we've still got this sticky cber nature and we can't perform at that level all the time we have all these trippings and trappings and fallings amen we got to realize that that's not what God's looking at anyways God's looking at Faith in his present truth that's the dividing line but God is so gracious to keep reminding of his word and sending his Spirit to correct us when we're wrong because he wants to bring us to Manifest this word amen so by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not without faith it is impossible to please God so all of our church attendant and dressing nice and acting nice and all of that without faith it can't please God Amen praise God oh praise God let's go to First John three 1 John chapter 3 in verse 4 whosoever commit a sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and to him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth hath not seen him neither knoweth him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest in the children of the devil whosoever do doth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so when it says he that sinth not is not of God Amen and he that is of God cannot sin amen if you take brother bram's definition of sin then the scripture makes sense if you take this definition of sin is unbelief the real only everything else is attributes of sin but the real Sin is unbelief and then you go back and look at this in verse 7 little children no man deceive you he that does doeth righteousness is righteous so I'm going to look at what righteousness is here in a minute even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God why because the faith of God has been injected into his life amen you're saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God and the seed of God is there to believe the word amen in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so now I want to look at what is this doing righteousness praise God let's go to Romans chapter 4 remember they told they told Jesus he was they were uh children of Abraham Abraham was their father but Jesus said if you were you would do the works of Abraham and let's look at uh Romans 4:1 one together what shall we say then that Abraham our father has pertained to the flesh has found for If Abraham were justified by works he had whereof to Glory but not before God for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness I love that scripture it didn't attain it by the working of the law because if we attain it by the working of the law then God has administered to us salvation by debt not by Grace but God wanted to give it by Grace Amen to be sure that it would come to the seed that the elect would get it amen so it's by Grace how can it be by Grace amen the only way it can be by Grace is if it comes by faith because it can't be by doing the works of the law the righteousness of doing the works because if you do the works and God owes you salvation then God is in debt to you and God cannot be in debt to you and then you're not saved by grace you're saved by works because God owes it to you because of what you did and God never saved anybody because he owed it to them what he owes us is death destruction termination off of this Earth that's what we deserve but it's his grace that allows us to partake of life so I want to read this again what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found this is good because we need to be if we want to be part of the Covenant of Grace we have to be Seed of Abraham it only works if we're Seed of Abraham so if you're Seed of Abraham you're part of the Covenant of unmerited Grace amen and God has promised that you inherited all things amen and that he'll be a God to you and he'll be a father and a God to you and you'll be his people all that is under the promise of Abraham so what what is Abraham our fathers pertain to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by work Heth whereof to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God faith and it was counted unto him for righteousness so Abraham is righteous why is Abraham righteous not because of all of his deeds but because he believed the word for his day when God spoke to him he believed it when he believed it it was counted or imputed unto him or put on him that he was righteous he got the title of righteous not by the Deeds of righteousness but by faith in the promise word of God Amen and we have to be children of Abraham and he said if you were Abraham's children you would do the Deeds of Abraham what were the Deeds of Abraham believe on whom God has sent he believed the word of God when he believed what God had told him it was counted to him for right that was the Deeds of Abraham that's what made him righteous listen it wasn't selling out his wife twice it wasn't lying to Pharaoh it wasn't lying to aimc it wasn't refusing to protect and defend his wife but sell her out to another king to protect his own that was not the Deeds of righteousness that gave him life and part of the promise but but he believed God and it was accounted unto him for righteousness amen let's look at uh verse 13 now for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is void and the promise made of none effect what is he saying you can't get this by obeying the law and doing the Deeds of the law you can't inherit it that way you inherit it by faith and when you are you have the faith of faithful Abraham then it then then it notifies you and God that you're a child of Abraham amen why because you have the faith of Abraham praise God now let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 I'm reading through lots of scriptures but I love it there's a lot more but we just can't do them all right now but we might get to them all back to Hebrews chapter 11 I should have just had you bookmark it amen so now we we see that the dividing line the separating between righteous and unrighteous listen isn't just deeds and now don't get me wrong there are righteous and unrighteous Deeds without a doubt you can do unrighteousness and you can do righteousness We should strive to do righteousness We should strive to avoid unrighteousness but when it comes down to it the dividing line of what's righteous and not righteous is whether or not you believe God because righteousness is by imputation because he believed God and we're children of Abraham now let's go to Hebrews 11:32 it says it says and what shall I more say for the time shall failed to tell of Gideon and of Barack of Samson of jeffa of David also of Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms through righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens whom women received their dead raised to life again and the others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scorings and moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen so now we see these Victors of faith and and Hebrews 11 goes through a whole series of the victors of Faith they overcame by faith that's what it said at the very beginning and and and what shall I more say of all of these men who through faith subdued kingdoms it was all done by faith it wasn't done by their Merit or by their strong will or by their strong arm or by their strong mind it was all accomplished by faith amen they believed what God told them in their day and when they believed that and surrendered to it God worked through them to perform some miraculous things but it was all by faith it was all by the word of God Amen brother bandam says in the stature of a perfect man says you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're un their their souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection that when Christ does come so now he's saying they without us are not yet made perfect and brother B says this church has to come to Perfection amen how how is she going to come Perfection I believe God has said a perfect word to bring a Perfect Bride to a perfect manifestation amen but she's going to have to do it through a perfect surrender am amen I believe it's the age that we live in all down through time God was unveiling the righteous seed if we read down through the Bible if you if brother BM says the Lamb's Book of Life is the Bible the book of redemption the marriage certificate he's got all kinds of names for them and he uses them synonymously with one another but if we open our Bible and start flipping through and reading through we're going to read a record of humanity of people of people in various circumstances and trials and difficulties and all kinds of circumstances but in the stories it's always somehow God has a way to bring him his word through a prophet and they brings the word through a prophet and certain of them are able to accept that word or to act upon it and when they act upon or accept or receive receive the word then the miraculous things happen afterwards and there's great victories that take place and great things that are manifest and and then it goes to the next story and you go to the next story of great trouble and tribulation and failings and fallings and risings and it's all through the Bible but if you if you follow it it's a record of humanity yes and God is constantly injecting himself into the story and how's he injecting himself into the story by bringing a word a prophecy some un failing of a word amen through a prophet through a messenger some way and when he injects that word there's a certain people on the Earth at that time that connect with that word and believe that word and through those individuals he does Supernatural miraculous things and then and then the story closes out and and time moves on and he opens another chapter and he does the same thing a different way but the same thing and that chapter closes and moves on and he opens another chapter and he does the same thing just a different way the names change the circumstances the locations but he keeps doing the same thing over and over and over again his people get in a circumstance that's difficult the situation is dire he comes on the scene he brings the word amen the word brings uh people to light they align with that word God does something Supernatural amen it's a miracle amen and then then we move on what is it it's the unveiling of the sons of God right praise God not by might and not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord all found through this record in the history of humanity there's always been bold claims many people claiming to be the righteous people the only ones the the the seed of God that there there's always been claims and I would venture to say there's always been confusion on who's right and who has it and who doesn't have it and what word is true and what word is not true and I mean they the Jews came out of Babylon and they came back with rabinal writings that weren't the Old Testament and they had they had taken a bunch of ideas and some of them they picked up from the Persians some of the Babylonians and they mix them in with Judaism and and they start presenting it and it creates great division and when the time that Jesus showed up on the scene they were all fractured and and divided on who's right and who's got the real truth and who's following what Rabbi from what century and it's always been that way which denomination right which truth is Right which this is right which that is right but God has always had a way he's always had a way to call his elect seed to to unveil his children and that way has always been by a fresh revelation of the word and God would bring a fresh revelation of his word and that fresh revelation of the word what what was it doing this is just my perspective now looking back it was unveiling the children of God because they were able to take God at his word they were some of them fishermen and tax collectors and harlots and farmers and outcasts and of the smallest tribe and the youngest sons and the if it could be true for them why can't it be true for you if he would go to the least of the tribes if he could go to the least House of the tribe if he could go to the youngest son if he could pull out a Gideon that way why can't it be you and listen Gideon was what was Gideon doing he was back behind the the threshing floor back behind the wine press threshing out a little wheat so that the Philistines wouldn't come and steal it from him again I mean this wasn't a mighty man this wasn't a great Victor this wasn't somebody who was you know overcoming he was back behind the wine press I can M every once in a while he'd poke poke his head up and make sure nobody was coming but the angel came to him because he knew who he was and he said now Gideon th Mighty Man of Valor can you imagine how that would feel if you were hiding in the closet counting your money cuz you didn't want anybody to steal it and you're nervous and your heart's beating because every time you hear a knock on the door this could be the thief's coming and every time they come I have no power to resist them and all I can do is just give them all my money yeah right and you're back there with the lights off and you're counting your money and you're praying that nobody comes to the door and all of a sudden an angel's behind you and says oh Chad you mighty man of Valor you Warrior you strong bold Overcomer it wasn't his deeds it wasn't his Merit it was in his actions he was a seed of God you ever notice in the Bible how there was times there's certain people in the Bible that God wouldn't put up with he gave them a chance they didn't take the chance they missed it you know there's other people in the Bible seems like God will just keep putting up with the angel comes and tells Gideon a message and Gideon says okay well uh don't be mad at me but I need a sign like an Angelic visitor is not enough for me I need a sign and one who knew my name so I'm going to throw out this Fleet and the you know the de on the one side do on the ground you know the whole story amen and it happens exactly like he asked he says once again oh please don't be angry with me but but I need another sign and why why is God bearing with this this Gideon what what's the whole story because God knows what's inside ins Gideon Gideon doesn't yet know what's inside Gideon but God knows what's inside Gideon and God is going to bring his word with the manifestation of the word to wake up something that's inside of Gideon and Gideon is going to come to the place where he can surrender to that word of God and God will use Gideon by faith to rot victory over the armies he wasn't coming because he was the best the strongest that you know you know the whole story he came to him because he was a predestinated son of God he didn't know it he had no idea but God used an angel to bring him a message and vindicate that message Amen to put him in position and then guide him Amen to a victory that was wrought by faith how did he win the victory by obeying the word of God he didn't win it by his armies he didn't win it by his might he didn't win it by his arms he didn't win it by his weapons he won that battle because he did what was illogical what he was irresponsible as a as a as a leader of a military he had thousands gathered to him and God told him to go out and find a way to sort him out and get rid of the thousands till you get down to 300 300 soldiers going out against thousands of the enemy that were better equipped and better soldiers what he did would have been deemed irresponsible if we had a leader in the Army do the same thing today and get wiped out he would be on he' be court marshaled but how did he win he didn't win by his sword he won by faith God had somebody who would stick with the word and by sticking with the word he wrought a miracle amen such a miracle amen that you would see there's something Supernatural about Gideon's leadership there's something Supernatural about this whole VI Victory something's going on amen he would come to a Moses who Moses was raised up the best that he could be raised up all kinds of accolades all kinds of abilities but then God would squish it flat send him out to the desert give him a hot tempered wife and make him a herdsman till he got to the place I don't know where he developed the stuttering I don't know if he always had it or if it happened through all of his trials gets to the point where God comes and tells him to go back into the commission go back into the word and this man says I can't even speak send somebody else I don't I'm not your man I can't do what you're asking me to do and and God I mean remember what I said about putting up with people people Moses looks at God and says I can't do it call somebody else he says no you're the one who going to do it he says well I can't I can't even speak I'm slow of tongue and I halt speech and gives him another and then he says no I send somebody God gets angry with him that's what the Bible says but he stuck with him yes Moses believed the word of God and he went according to the word of God listen Moses did not go to Egypt because he desired to go to Egypt he didn't go to Egypt because he wanted to be a hero he didn't want to go to Egypt because he wanted to look good he didn't want to go because he wanted to be the head of a Nation he didn't want to go so he had a neat story to tell his grandkids he was afraid of going he didn't want to go and he didn't think he was capable of going but yet under the word of God he obeyed the word of God and he went and God took a vessel who went not according to his own will or desire but according to the will and desire and word of God and he went out there then now now Moses is not performing his own will because he didn't want to go he's standing there only doing what God tells him to do because it's not his plan his desire his will it's all God calling him he just had something inside that could believe God and he comes down now and he and he says you're going to be a God to pharaoh and he comes down to Pharaoh he says let my people go and if you don't this is going to happen and everything Moses said happened when it came out of his mouth he had the creative power of the spoken word when God said go speak flies he spoke flies flies come into existence what was he he was a God to Pharaoh he was a God in Egypt he wasn't the God he was a minor God what was he he was a son of God who was afraid to go to Egypt thought he was too old washed up couldn't talk anymore scared to go back but inside of him was an amateur God he didn't know it he didn't can you imagine what he would think for 40 years as a failure on the back side of the desert I don't know what he thought I know what I would think he comes back and he speaks flies and he speaks frogs and he speaks hail comes to the Red Sea holds up a staff and the water separates like a wall on the right hand and a wall on the left what is it we got on the earth what is that that's an amateur God but how is he an amateure God not of his will not of his desire not of his [Music] mind he's an amateur God when he comes back to only doing and saying what God tells him to do and say it's God working through Moses that's where Jesus was Jesus come to the Earth and and he had gifts he was full of gifts brother BR said he could have defeated uh Satan in the wilderness with all the gifts but he didn't use any of the gifts that he had he only used the word CU he was leaving us an example and he had so he had ability he had gifts but he only did what the father showed him he was God upon the Earth but in what way did he manifest being God upon the Earth he manifested through himself surrendering and yielding his submission to his father now his father's command to him he would act out and it was a manifestation of God upon the Earth speaking to the storm and speaking to the waves and and and and raising the dead what was it he was doing what his father told him to do amen I I think sometimes we get the wrong idea about what it means to be an amateur God like somehow we're just going to go do whatever we want anytime we want if we start to take a carnal self-will and start to administer the promise with a carnal self-will we're going to find that we're going to be corrupting the word of God but what God done is our day he's been so gracious to us to send a prophet to bring back the mind of God for this day to bring back lord the desire of God what he wants and the way he wants it and and restoring back the truth of the word to us that's been lost through generations and he brought that word back to us us amen and now he's unveiling the sons of God Amen by he's finding those that are righteous and what does it mean to be righteous to believe God and have it accounted to you for righteousness now he's looking for his children amen and those children are those that are able to come under the banner of this word and surrender whatever they were thinking and surrender whatever they thought was right and come in line to this word that God restored to us through a prophetic voice and what becomes the dividing line in our day the div iding line is Faith and unbelief amen I didn't make it that way God made it that way now and don't get me don't get me wrong there's more to the story there's those that'll be saved at the white Throne judgment we thank God for that grace and mercy but that's not what I'm speaking of now I'm speaking of Sons and Daughters of God the the minor Gods the amateur Gods upon the Earth brother says this all the way back in 1952 and message called believ in God he said how did God make the Earth this Earth that you're sitting on this morning people don't want to believe in faith how did God make the Earth he spoke it you see this he spoke the word come into existence in this world this morning is the spoken word of God and he believed his own word I love this statement here it is watch it and if God if you're offspring of him and God is in you you'll believe his own word he'll believe his own word that though it can't be seen felt taste or anything he'll believe it see what I mean for God in you will believe his own word is that right then you don't look at the things you see you look at the things that God said amen so God when he spoke the world Amen when we see in gen he spoke the world brother Bram comes along along and he says he had to believe his own word why because he goes all the way back Amen to the book of Hebrews that said by faith we know that the worlds were formed by the Faith Of God by faith the worlds were formed what was it it wasn't just the words it was faith in the words that created it God's Own Faith created the world amen amen because he had to believe his own word and if God has to believe his word what are the sons of God supposed to do with the word of God they have to believe the word that's what makes them sons of God that's what unveils them as sons of God what what declares that they're sons of God because they can believe the word of God and in 19 55 he says this way and do you now believe now let me tell you something each man that's born again with the spirit of God in him is a miniature Creator now that might shake you a little but that's the truth we're in the image of God God is a Creator that's the reason that you can believe that God could heal a person cuz God is in you and God made this world he just spoke and and his word become material the very ground that you're sitting on is the word of God made manifest if he didn't where did he get it see he just spoke it and it turned into existence he believed his own word and if if a man's born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize and so that makes him part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him part of God God had to believe his word the sons of God have to believe his word that's what identify them as sons of God Amen let's go to first John together 1 John chapter 5 1 John chapter 5 verse one he says 1 John 5 verse1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that be that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievious for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God so this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our faith in what our faith in the word of God when you go back and look at Hebrews we go through Hebrews Abraham believed God Sarah by faith Abel by faith Everyone by Faith by Faith by faith what did they do they wrought Miracles they delivered out of the mouth of lions they the they they sent the armies to flight they vanquished enemies they did all these things how did they do it by Faith by faith in what by faith in The God Who was speaking to them that day how are we going to overcome this day by Faith by faith in what by faith in the word that's God's given us today see Adam remained an amateur God when he stayed with the word that God had given him amen but when he left the word he lost his position amen but God has given us a word this day and what's he trying to do he's trying to restore restore what restore all that's been lost all that's been taken away all that's been Fallen by what by the word and who's he looking for he's looking for his children who can say that's the truth I know it it rings inside that's true and not just say that's true but say God help me I want to give my life to this truth amen that word truth I want to live that truth help me God to live the truth truth because I know that that's true amen and what's he doing he's going to start manifesting again the Sons and Daughters of God because the Sons and Daughters of God believe God believe God believe his word believe what he says and I want to I want to finish by this thought there's a thought here that I want to share at the end something brother Benham said here in the message super sign he says they say the days of Miracle has passed and all these things let them prove it I'll give you an everlasting sign the super sign oh yes now he could could have come an angel he could have come whatever he wished to but he's chose to come as Abraham's seed amen Abraham suped that's right the way he chose to come to show in this last days God's super sign super race oh yes not what you call a super race but what God calls a super race because they got what Supernatural power with Supernatural signs through a supernatural belief and a supernatural word from a supernatural God Amen you talk about super where are you going to get the Supernatural word from a supernatural God and a supernatural belief it's going to come from the seed of God that's on the inside to believe the supernatural word that he sent this day amen he's bringing the two together Supernatural God and a supernatural body in a natural people giving Supernatural signs Hallelujah yes a super race they they that know their God shall do exploits great exploits and show Supernatural signs of people Abraham's seed the sign of the super natural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally God is going to have a super sign a super race a god race amateur Gods upon this Earth and he's bringing us back Amen to where the sons of God are made manifest on this Earth again in the Millennium with Christ and he's building us up to that and he's going to display what did he do through the prophet in our day amen what was that Prophet doing when he was speaking to Nature when he was up on the mountain in Colorado amen and he was up there he was up there on a hunting trip amen and when he was up there on a hunting trip he's meditating talking about God what is he he's a natural man living a natural life out with his friends on a hunting trip but he's a Son of God Amen there's a c Gene of God he is he's predestinated to be an amateur God he's an offspring of God a child of God and he's up there on the on the mountain and there's a storm forecast the storm's coming you know the story well and he goes as it begins to rain and swirl around and the flakes begin to drop he's coming down off the mountain he's coming down off the mountain why because he's a man this is dangerous he's going to safety amen I want to catch this story and keep it in context God says to him a voice he said just as clear as anything said go back where you you came from amen go back so he turns around he goes back where's he going he's going into the storm he's going into destruction he's going into danger but he had learned to obey the voice it wasn't about thinking it was about obeying now it's not about his will it's about the word please follow this he goes back up to the mountain and starts to eat a sandwich cuz he doesn't know what else to do and listen he starts thinking maybe that was me you go back and listen to the way brother B says this it's amazing listen there this is a man on the earth that has more Supernatural experiences than anybody I've ever heard of in my life yeah but he never comes with that spiritual arrogancy like he always knows everything and got everything figured out and knows the answer this happened it means this and I know the interpretation of this event he never most of the time he's saying I don't really know was that me wasn't that me that could have been meise and he heard a voice an audible voice as clear as anything but he's sitting down eating a sandwich in a storm that's whirling around an old soggy sandwich that somebody made as a joke for him amen as a human being sitting on a log eating a soggy sandwich questioning whether that voice was God or not listen there's a reason I want to tell you this story I want to tell you because this whole plan of adoption and sons of God and amateur Gods this is God's plan not your plan this is God's will not your will it's not what you work yourself up to and get proud about and Shout about and get loud and get arrogant and claim it with a boldness that's not going to do anything if it's not God's will it's not going to happen God wanted to manifest something in this man and as he's running down the Saddleback amen he's running down what he calls the hog back to get down to safety God stops him in his tracks and makes him go back why because this testimony has to be told to Sons and Daughters of God in this generation so they can see what the goal is see sitting on a log eating a soggy sandwich questioning whether or not he really heard the voice of God or not I I absolutely love the honesty of God's Prophet so that we can be real people and be honest sometimes we're pretty sure God wants us to do something and then things go wrong and then we wonder if that was us or what that was God and then we feel guilty for even questioning it what's wrong with me Hey listen you're in the same category the prophet of God was in this day cuz he didn't always know what was going on and he didn't always have it figured out and what was he a manifest Son of God Amen he was the one that God was using to display what a bride coming of Christ looks like he's sitting on this log and I think if I remember the details right he tells it in a few places but he gets up and he's got a scope listen he's got his scope under his coat so it doesn't fog up in case he runs into a bear or something during the storm you know he's not walking around like an amateur God waiting for a bear to come no he's got his gun tucked under his coat in case he runs into a bear so he can shoot it defend himself he's a human being who happens to be a Son of God there's a reality in all of thisen said I don't know about you but I am so sick of fake put on trying to be spiritual the experience and brother B had and the experiences we've had in our Liv they were real they were Supernatural God did it it wasn't a put on and it wasn't trying to massage something into something to look like something spiritual it was the real deal when God moves it's real that's right it's what I'm one is real gets up to go I believe how the story goes and God tells him to go back or not go don't remember the second time then a voice comes says aren't I the god of creation aren't I the god that still the waters and the waves and the wind and he says a few things like that and brother B says yes God I believe you he says you speak the storm will obey you you speak listen God could have spoke God could have done like he did with Moses put the words right in his mouth say you go call now this was different God says you speak and now here's a man a human being who was afraid of the storm afraid of dying in the storm and being cautious about maybe running into bears in the storm man strains himself up and he begins to speak out of human lips out out of a man who just ate a soggy onion and a bunch of other stuffed sandwich like I want this to be so real I want it to be as real as it really is this man stands up after finishing a soggy sandwich and hears the voice of God and he says Cloud storm you go away go back where you came from sun come out and Shine for 4 days while we're on our hunting trip said just then the wind that was swirling begin to change change direction and softened and then just a few more whisp of wind and then it blew the C clouds away and and the sun started shining and and then a voice told him won't you walk with me and and brother brandham starts walking Amen in this experience with God Amen what did he just do he just did the same thing Jesus Christ did when he stood on the bow of the boat and said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him what was that that was God in flesh that was Jesus Christ amen the the Son of God now what do we have at the end time we have a son of God Amen we have we have a man a human being amen with a predestinated position in God and God by his own will directs the man through the storm and tells him now you speak amen but listen to me that man who spoke to that storm had to believe that that storm was going to go away or that storm was not going to move because when God spoke the word amen creation didn't start molding itself into what he said unless he believed the word amen that storm was wasn't going anywhere if that man wasn't so convinced in that voice that spoke to him that that storm was going to go he spoke and Faith moved the clouds away who said it listen it's so important he wasn't repeating what God told him to repeat he was saying he was speaking of his own accord because he had permission to speak this is power over creation forces is like a blizzard in a storm and the and I mean these are huge forces and Powerful forces and he was moving it by his spoken word what was it it was a manifestation of an amateur God on Earth listen that wasn't only for him God has more children on the earth oh my somehow I believe that promis is from for me too but you know what I have to believe it I can't be guessing at it or hoping it but I have to believe I have to believe what do you have to believe Chad I I don't believe that I have to figure out what is the right thing to do in a situation and then use my own presumption to try to to say something and make it happen I've tried that too many times and wound up disappointed but I believe that I'm a Son of God why do you believe that Chad I I really can't show you any reason why I can't show you my Merit or conduct or anything but all I can do is say there's a witness in my heart that I believe this message is the truth like not just believe it's true but I actually believe I'm part of it that I'm connected to it in a deep way that's beyond my thinking but there's a deep connection to the truth of this word inside of me and I believe that that's my position also as a Son of God but I don't believe it's for me to use this peanut of a brain to try to figure out when to speak to a storm and when not to speak to a storm I think it's for me to take my position like the prophet did and take my position like brother brandham did and like Jesus Christ did and stay behind the word and wait for God to tell me when to speak or when to move because if God does then the faith in my my heart shall rise and say that's nothing but the truth and it will move by faith not the force of my words it doesn't matter how dogmatic you are and how angry you get at the Devil and how much you scream and how forceful you Screech Screech out of scripture if you don't believe it in your heart nothing's happening these things are all had by faith and listen you look at Hebrews 11 by faith they subdued armies by faith they quenched the Fire by by faith they stopped the mountains of line by Faith by Faith by faith but it was by faith that won the victory by faith that brought the conception by faith that that that gave the Revelation by faith all of this was done but it was also that same faith that caused them to be clothed in Goat skins and and sheep skins and be chased amen from cave to cave and be destitute and Afflicted they were able to take the good and the bad by faith and their faith didn't diminish whether they were vanquishing and Army stopping the mouths of lions are being chased from a cave to a cave the faith didn't change they still believe the word of God these were the superheroes of Faith the super race the sup seed and they believed even when they were destitute and Afflicted they still believed Jesus or the scripture says no not that scripture sorry I want to read a couple quotes out of adoption and I'm going to close I'm closing with this thought he said but in the fullness of time this is adoption part four from 1960 the fullness of time God sent his own in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance to sunship to be a Son of God what is my inheritance sunship he says now he says' and now this may just choke you to death but do you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods amen amen listen do you believe that's your position do you believe you could do you believe that you could speak to the storm in Colorado and it would go away I believe it but I don't know when and I don't know how and when it's appropriate I'm going to need God somehow to let me know because if I go out there and try to do it I'm going to know deep in my heart this is just me trying to prove something or me trying to do something and it's going to fail miserably because it has to be done by faith it can't be my effort and it can't be and and it can't be for false motives I can't be going out trying to vindicate myself or attract a crowd or draw attention or become something better than the next one that's not going to work that's all self-motivated that is not an amateur God an amateur that's a false god but do you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so by the Bible said Jesus said did you not your law say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he gave them dominion over all things and he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his dominion and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him he's the logos that went out of God that is true that was the son of God then he made man that little God and he said if they call those who the word of God come to prophets if they call them Gods who the word of God come to and God said so himself that they were Gods he told Moses I made you a God and made Aaron your Prophet amen he said I may act like a religious crank but I'm not and when your eyes come open and see these things all right he made man a god a God in his dominion and his Dominion goes from sea to Sea and from Shore to Shore he has control of it and when Jesus came being the one God with without sin uh he proved it when the winds blowed peace be still and when the the tree he said no man eat from thee verily I say unto you you that's little Gods if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said this is what Jesus said Jesus cursed the Fig Tree amen when he cursed the tree they came back the next day he was cursed and they were astonished and he says don't be astonished amen if if you believe in your heart say unto this mountain be plucked up and cast to The Sea and don't doubt in your heart you shall have what you said Jesus was putting it on the basis of Faith amen back in adoption he says go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and the nature is groaning crying everything's a moving why for the manifestation of the sons of God when the true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning up out y I haven't had any rain I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crop oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man the Dominion brother B this is 1960 he's telling us this is where we're coming back to in 196 60 he didn't have this experience yet of the mountain in Colorado he never had spoke to the storm amen he never had had that experience but he's already preaching this in 1960 that this is where man's coming to now there's just a couple more quotes that I want to read he said now in perfect Faith this is also 1963 this is before he has the incident and on the mountain in Colorado that happens in the fall of 1963 I think it's October this is in August says and and now we're going to turn to Mark St Mark 11th chapter we're going to begin reading at the 22nd verse and many of you know the scripture it's very familiar it was a scripture I was thinking on brother Russell when he spoke to me and said about those squirrels and they was just the very scripture I was thinking on it's always been a puzzle he said if ye say not if I say if you say and what scripture did he go to right to the one where Jesus says if you say to this mountain be plucked up and cast to The Sea and doubt not in your heart here's brother brandom sitting up against a tree and he say he's thinking about this scripture see he said he always puzzled over it he just wasn't sure about it he was questioning it he was thinking about it meditating on it and God come down to him and God says you can speak and brother B says what do I say and I'm just paraphrasing you know I'm paraphrasing I don't have all the details he says what do I say he says well you're hunting you have an any squirrels you need squirrels and then brother brandom now he says I want a squirrel to come from here to there and over there he he says three squirrels and he and he and the squirrels are created Amen brother Brenham tells us this is something that didn't even happen in Jesus's Ministry because when Jesus broke the bread and the fish he had something and broke it and it multiplied this was creating squirrels where there were no squirrels what are we seeing we're seeing an amateur God on the earth amen yes but this amateur God on the earth didn't say you know what I would like to have some squirrels God I want scoll no God come down and directed him and told him what to say to me this is my opinion I believe that's why brother Brenham had the faith to produce the squirrels because God spoke to him listen to how he says this in 61 there's a couple quotes that I want to tie into the way I'm thinking what I'm preaching right now to to help formulate my understanding he said now all the power that'll rais us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now the power in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are do you believe that's true amen but here's where he qualifies it that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's the law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours if you can believe it if God can lead your soul to believe it if you believe it from the soul and God can lead your soul to believe it it's yours if you've got a mental workup or conception amen that's not the same thing but if God can lead your soul to believe it then it's yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean the power is controlled if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time amen you mean the power to create another world is in me yes all the time the power to speak squirrels into existence was with brother brandham all the time prise God but he didn't do it all the time he did it when God gave him the key of Faith to unlocked that and when God spoke to him and unlocked a faith in his soul God LED his soul to believe it he spoke it it came to pass if you can find the key to this law now I want to go down to a question somebody asked brother bham after the seals in 1964 questions and answers they asked him this question they said this the third pull and is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection the son of man this is or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not Escape all these things Escape all these things and stand before the son of man the quote of scripture Luke 21:36 now here's brother brenham's answer my dear friend now I think here that you got you got a good statement yes sir yes sir now that would be so so brother bandam in other words uh I'm not going to polish up what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to the people you're believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witness to squirrels and all these other things that's been done did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things and like that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but was God it was God that sent him down to Egypt see now I believe that the Holy Spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell certain certain person that they are not they're trying to overcome a certain thing and they cannot do it they're smoking they're drinking they're they're stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be or they got lustful spirit and you just go where they are and you say thou Spirit come out of there I set this captive free would it take place absolutely yes indeed it absolutely would it' take place but now upon my own presuming now presume means to venture without Authority I'd go down there to help this person I'm just presuming that it'll be all right then I don't know I can call the name of the Lord over them I can pray for them do whatever I wish if I had my own way this morning I just hadn't interview with this little lady sitting here in the wheelchair to come to this meeting today they had to have the fire department take her out of her house in Chicago and people live across the street and don't come to the meeting see what would I do if it was in my power I have the authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do it see I have the authority from God to do it but now when he gives the orders she'd go back home well now that is the truth I'd just be as willing to die die this morning is I'd be in anything that's the truth but first you see no one even Jesus himself said the son of man can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father do that doeth the son likewise we know that St John 159 all right the son does nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that the son will do likewise all right all right we got it listen I believe with all my heart that God is calling for the manifestation of the sons of God that the whole Earth Earth is groaning for what are we seeing earthquakes and fires and wars and pest what is going on in the news all around us this Earth is groaning and travail for the manifestation of the sons of God they want the amateur Gods to come back to their position the Earth hasn't been right since the amateur God lost his position and the Earth is going to come right one day and the Millennium is going to be a glorious reign with the amateurs of God the amateur Gods connected with their King Jesus back on Earth the bride and the bridegroom back on Earth again and ruling and reigning amen but God is building our faith and he's bringing us back into this position and he's brought the he's restored the word to increase our faith listen I tell you what no matter what happens you got to have the faith for it to happen and if a voice comes and speaks to you and says I've you're in need right now you need this speak it it will happen if you have no faith down inside of you you'll hear a voice and you just question the voice and you don't know what you should do and you pass it over because you start looking at yourself amen but oh God if this message has woke us up to who we really are if it's taken our identity and placed us back in God back in the mind of God as Sons and Daughters of God restored the truth back to us and raised our faith to a place that when God calls for it we can speak and it can happen not of our presumption but of his will not of our will but of his it's a surrender to his will but there's got to be a faith who we are we've got to believe that we are going to be the amateur Gods on this Earth that God's called us as Sons and Daughters of God to be amateur Gods amen and when brother Bram talks about speaking to somebody and they would be totally restored and ready for the Rapture or however it's worded that way he says yes that's true but that was sovereignly given I never asked for those things God just told me to say and if he told me to say and I said it it would be absolutely exactly that way he believed it he believed when God told him to create squirrels he believed it he spoke he created squirrels told him to speak to the storm he told him about his wife's tumor he believed it before he spoke to that that that to that tumor when he spoke it happened before he was praying oh God uh help my poor wife Lord should we have the surgery should we not have the surgery uh yes amen Lord you know what he's praying Lord if they could just put it off till after the holiday so we could get back here and then then go back what's he praying like he's praying just like you and I pray just like you and I who who don't have perfect understanding of the will of God we don't know what God wants to do in this situation we just believe his word is true we believe he'll heal us We Believe by a Stripes you're healed we believe that but that that he Health all of our diseases and we keep confessing our faith in word as God works out healing in our life but he's down praying just like you and I would pray praying for his poor wife praying for the examination that day praying that the timing would work out well and and and all of these things and all at once God said stand to your feet and he stood up and he says you speak and as you say is what it will be he says before the doctors touch her amen amen before the doctors touch her it'll be gone what was that that was an amateur God speaking on the Earthen she went to the appointment laid on the table and she said as the doctor just before he put his hand she felt something cool sweep over her body as just as the doctor was going to examine her and he examined her and said and he said sister brandom I can't find one trace of that tumor what was it an amateur God spoke on the Earth but he didn't do it presumptuously he was praying like you and I pray he was holding on to the promise of God he was believing that God would move for his wife amen but then God amen come on the scene and said this is going to be different than that you're going to speak it yourself praise God you know what this is this is the reality this is real this is not presumption this is not trying this is just holding on with faith and believing and waiting for God to do something brother B when he said that quote about the one we just read answering the person's question about can you speak to somebody they'd be whole and restore yes that absolutely that'd be the truth he said now this little woman here if I had my choice she'd be healed he says now I can pray for her I can call the name of the Lord over her I can believe that's the reality that's where we're at we can take God at his word we can say God I believe your word you said by your stripes I'm Healed and I'm holding on to that word and listen it works friends we believe the word of God and God manifest that word but I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know what method he's going to use to do it I just know he's going to do it and I'm waiting with faith until he does it believing in the promised word of God but there's a time and a place where God can come down and use your voice amen and speak things into existence speak realities speak because why because you're amateur Sons and Daughters of God but how's it going to work the same way it worked with Jesus in the same way it worked with brother brandom Jesus never did anything unless his father showed him if I could just come to the point I think it's the point I don't even know what's it going to take to get to this place where God can speak through our lips as amateur Sons and Daughters of God I don't really think it's going to take us getting a whole lot more bold or loud or I think it's going to take a greater submission I think what God's Building us to is a greater obedience a greater surrender more of laying our ideas down and sticking with his word more of surrendering our wants to his will am yes what's he doing he's shaping us he's molding us he's making us does he want to display himself through us I believe that I do believe that there's many things brother Brenham says about the squeeze and the last moments of time and the bride and the manifestations in the third pole there's so many things he says that looks like there could be an amazing time upon this Earth through the bride do you believe that you heard those I don't I'm not even trying to project what will happen or how will happen or what the circumstance or the I don't even know all I know is he keeps alluding to this over and over again you read Look Away to Jesus and some of these messages like that he keep alluding to it and so what's it going to take it's not going to be me deciding it's time now for that to manifest and me going out and bulldozing my way through and making it that's not going to be brother brandham never did that Jesus didn't do that Moses didn't do it Gideon didn't do it tell me who did it go through the Heroes of Faith go through the example we have in our day look at Jesus Christ you know what I think we need I think we need to lay down our lives more than we ever have I think we need to give up our thinking more than we ever have I think we need to come back to this word and the word only and stop with all the other voices and nonsense and come back and say God you've got a voice in this day you brought a word in this day I believe it I accept it I stick with it I surrender all my thinking to have this word praise be to God I Surrender not I did or I have or I can or I will but God I Surrender whatever you want whatever you say the way you want it the timing you want it the way you want it I believe you I believe your word I believe it's true I believe you're going to do Mighty things I believe you want to use me and I'm here and I'm available whenever you say I don't I just don't see I just don't see a bold arrogant humanistic approach to the manifestation of the third pool I think it's going to be an utter humility and simplicity just like it was with the prophet of God do I believe in a bold faith in the promises of God yes grab a hold of it and hold it like we preach Wednesday night God said it I believe it and I believe it's for me I'm one of them get a hold of it and hold on to it until it comes to pass but when it comes to this other level of speaking into existence don't play with that presumptuously let God order his word in the message why are people so tossed about he makes this statement some people gets this wrong impression of what the anointing is do you ever think of that when when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he went and entered into a temple and picked up the scroll and read the spirit of God is upon me for Heath anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick to give sight to the Blind and now we would think if such an anointing was on him that that been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the Bible said he laid down the Scrolls sat down and precious words proceeded out of his mouth that's what he done under the anointing why because that's what God wanted done under that anointing listen the anointing is not a motion the anointing is supreme power in control Hallelujah like knowing exactly what and how see and that's what's there you know what an anointing is supreme power under control like knowing how and what amen not not going around saying I don't know what he was I don't know how but I guess it this way and I'm going for it no that's not it Su the anointing is supreme power under control knowing how and what with no doubt in your heart whatsoever if brother brandham said if that voice spoke to me and told me to go raise up I mean George Washington I'd invite all the press and come down he had faith in that voice because he saw it work that was his faith that was working not a bit of presumption to it now he said he can't go down there and just raise up George Washington brother Bram could even pray for people and called them delivered he could pray but he couldn't do it unless God told him on the platform he said go be healed in jesus' name go be well in jesus' name he never declared them healed unless God showed him that they were healed he believed the word he confessed the word he stood with the word but when it come time to go raise Abraham Lincoln or George Washington from the grave he was going to wait for God to tell him that he wasn't going to go presumptuously the anointing is supreme power under control hallelujah amen knowing how and what God has revealed his word to us there's so many things we know how and what on why because of the prophet's Ministry we know how to conduct ourselves we know how to get married we know when not to get married we know how to act in church we know we know so many things we know how and what why because he brought us his word through a prophet we know how and what we know the truth of the word we know how to do things we know what to do in many many cases and now you can stand on with bold faith and believe that God's going to move on it supreme power in control that's the anointing praise God in the fourth seal this is the last quote I'm going to read in the fourth seal this is the way brother benam says it I believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the bases of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch of chlorox bleach it just breaks it into chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it come from see and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does and that sets a man across the chasm again as a Son of God see and then he's he becomes the even he's the creative power of God is in him and at least whenever God can command it to be done it'll be done this is in the fourth seal then the creative power of God is in him and and at least whenever God can command it to be done it'll be done you know what I want more than anything I want to be under an anointing supreme power in control I want his word have control of my daily life I want this message that he brought through a prophet I want it to control my thinking control my actions I want to be I want to be anointed under the message of the hour I want it to be power under Supreme control that my dictates my my language my speaking my actions is all under the control of this message I want to be surrendered and sold out and have faith and this word is what I gives us our identification we can believe we're Sons and Daughters of God because the veil has been taken off the mystery is unveiled we're in the Harvest Time where he's separating the chap and the wheat he's separating the wheat and the tears and showing what the wheat is what are the sons of God those that can believe like Abraham believed and be imputed righteousness unto them because they believe the word for their day I believe that I believe I'm one of them and I believe if God ever tells me to speak squirrels into existence we can speak squirrels into existence why cuz I first have to believe that I'm a son or daughter of God I have to believe it's for me I have to believe that's my position I believe I have to believe that's what God wants to do in this day is Manifest himself through me if I can believe that and have that kind of Faith now all I have to do is wait for him to say and when he says it'll come to pass I believe this word of God and I want this word to be what controls my thinking my life let's all Stand Together praise be to God this message didn't come for no reason it didn't come like we said before it didn't come for new ideas musicians if you'll come and brother John if you'll come it didn't come for a better concept of religion it didn't come for better behaved people this message came to reveal to us who we really are amen it came to shape us and mold us and to the image of Jesus Christ to bring us into a position a predestinated position so that we can have faith in God to come unto adoption what is the adoption when he can hand you the checkbook you know what happened on the mountain in Colorado God handed brother Brenham the checkbook so whatever you say when he was under a tree in Indiana squirrel hunting you know what God did he handed him the checkbook prise God amen amen that's what brother B said adoption is when he can hand you the checkbook because he knows you can handle it you're under control say God help us mold Us by this by this word that brings us to adoption that perfects us amen let that water of the washing of the word wash me away till you can bring me into Perfection to where you can bring me into adoption where you can trust me with the checkbook for your glory amen praise God Jesus never did anything by himself and for himself he did it as he was led of the father I say God help me to get myself out of this picture help me just to surrender to you and let you come and do things brother B said if William Brenham can get out of the picture God can come and do things William brenham's never even thought of said oh God help me to get myself out of the picture so that you can come and do things Chad Lamb's never thought of so that you can manifest yourself so that you can declare your glory on this Earth where does God want to manifest himself in the bride I want to have that anointing amen let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father I thank you God for the day that we live in God I believe like your Prophet said this is the Golden Age this is the greatest day to be alive this is the day when you you're taking back all that the enemy had stole you're giving it back to your children you're bringing us back into our position God we realize that Adam lost it because he left the word so God now you've brought the word to bring us back into position God help us to surrender more than we've surrendered to believe more than we beli to to give up and just to take you at your word God bring that word to mold us and make us into your very image to be on this Earth what you want us to be to come to the adoption to be Sons and Daughters of God God I'm sorry for my shortcomings I'm sorry for my sins I'm sorry Lord for my Humanity God I'm sorry for playing around with things I shouldn't have played with sorry for trying ding of My Own Strength to accomplish Feats for your kingdom I'm sorry Lord sorry for pushing when I should have waited sorry for waiting when I should have pushed

very IM image Lord God I'm sorry for what I've done with your word but Lord I Repent God I want to come to a place where you can use me any way you choose and I'll believe you and stand fast in the

to use I want you to use my hands and my feet and my eyes and I want you to use my mouth Lord and I want to be all surrender to you that you might use me may we come under that anointing of supreme control like you were when you were on this Earth God may you do Mighty things through your children God I want more than anything Lord I desire that you would be made manifest in this flesh of mine
