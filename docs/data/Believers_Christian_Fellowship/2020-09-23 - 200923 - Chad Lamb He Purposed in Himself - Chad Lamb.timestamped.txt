[2:54] you can have your seats i'm going to
[2:57] stay in ephesians we're going to come
[2:58] back and read ephesians again but i just
[3:00] want to share a testimony
[3:02] with you um this past monday
[3:05] um i went over to visit um levi yoder
[3:09] again
[3:09] levi you you know is the amish man that
[3:12] we've been visiting for a little over a
[3:14] year now
[3:15] and um he came in contact with the
[3:17] message through ezra him and ezra within
[3:19] the
[3:20] were in the same facility he grabbed a
[3:22] hold of the message
[3:23] and he grabbed a hold of it with both
[3:24] hands and he come out we've been
[3:27] visiting him regularly since then
[3:29] well we went monday and it was really
[3:34] quite a blessing because brother ezra
[3:36] hadn't been able to go for a year he had
[3:38] been blocked and was not able to go
[3:40] but by the grace of god god removed that
[3:42] block supernaturally and he was able to
[3:44] go this time which levi was greatly
[3:47] blessed to see him
[3:49] but it was a very very special trip
[3:51] because
[3:52] levi and his whole family desired to be
[3:54] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[3:56] christ
[3:57] on this trip so so we went over there
[4:00] with that purpose in mind
[4:01] and because we don't communicate uh it's
[4:04] not easy there's no cell phone only by
[4:06] mail
[4:06] we don't have time to send a letter and
[4:08] get one back in between visits so
[4:10] you never know for sure what you're
[4:12] gonna find when you get back there
[4:14] but they had to express the desire and
[4:16] the trip before to be baptized in the
[4:17] name of the lord jesus christ
[4:19] and so we went with that purpose in mind
[4:23] brother ezra and i and brother jeremy
[4:25] sanders and
[4:27] we went over there and uh god was so
[4:30] gracious to us we we went over
[4:32] uh levi didn't know ezra was coming so
[4:35] he comes stomping out the front door and
[4:38] and uh just embraced him hugged him and
[4:40] there was tears and it was quite a
[4:41] blessing
[4:42] and then we went into the house and we
[4:44] just sat and we just fellowship just
[4:46] fellowshipped on the word
[4:48] just for an hour and a half maybe and
[4:50] then finally i said well we're here to
[4:52] baptize you you know
[4:53] we just couldn't stop talking about the
[4:55] word long enough to even have a baptism
[4:57] service
[4:58] so we we had a service i had prepared
[5:02] some scriptures and some things on water
[5:04] baptism and
[5:05] we spent some time just instructing in
[5:07] water baptism maybe 45 minutes and
[5:09] it was amazing to see the response to
[5:11] the word because we've had fellowship
[5:13] before
[5:14] but nothing like exhortation or
[5:16] preaching in any way and this really
[5:17] wasn't preaching we were all sitting in
[5:18] chairs in a circle
[5:20] but it was the first time we were just
[5:21] taking the word and beginning to break
[5:22] it down scripture after scripture
[5:24] and it was amazing to see them feed on
[5:27] the word the same way we feed on the
[5:29] word
[5:29] with the same pool with the same spirit
[5:32] and we become to certain things and
[5:33] certain phrases that come from the
[5:35] message
[5:35] ways of looking at the scripture and
[5:37] baptism and you would just see them
[5:39] light up just the expression the glow
[5:41] and you're like that hit the spot
[5:43] it hit them the same way it hit me you
[5:45] know and it was just such a camaraderie
[5:47] such a fellowship
[5:49] and so uh brother levi
[5:53] had i asked him i said you have a place
[5:55] to baptize he goes yeah the lord's
[5:57] provided
[5:58] and uh he said i was looking at horse
[6:03] troughs
[6:04] and i'm telling you we're in the mission
[6:06] field friends
[6:08] i'm looking at horse troughs and he said
[6:10] i went to tractor supply and i
[6:12] i we were looking at these poly ones but
[6:14] they were too short and
[6:15] finally i found the perfect one but i
[6:17] didn't have enough money to buy it
[6:19] and he said god just supernaturally
[6:21] provided and i went back and bought the
[6:23] perfect one it was a galvanized
[6:25] long horse trough and he had put it down
[6:28] in the basement where they're living
[6:29] temporarily in the house where they
[6:30] finish the upstairs
[6:31] into a kitchen area that's all concrete
[6:33] and they've got a
[6:34] big uh a big wood burning kettle they
[6:38] put
[6:38] it looks like they can put 20 gallons of
[6:40] water in there heat it up and have their
[6:42] water for the day
[6:43] when it cools off they heat it back up
[6:45] with a wood fire underneath
[6:46] and he had one bucket at a time
[6:49] filled this horse trough full
[6:53] and uh i don't know how hot he got it
[6:55] because we were upstairs fellowshipping
[6:56] for an hour hour and a half we went down
[6:57] it was still warm water
[6:59] so it might have been good we let it
[7:00] cool off
[7:02] we got down there and and uh
[7:06] brother ezra had told me that he had
[7:08] told the lord he said lord if you make a
[7:10] way for me to go
[7:12] i'm going to get re-baptized because i
[7:14] want to rededicate my life to you
[7:16] and ezra knows there's no scriptural
[7:18] mandate he doesn't have to do that but
[7:20] it was something in his heart
[7:21] he wanted to do as a way of consecration
[7:23] to the lord
[7:24] and god supernaturally made a way and so
[7:27] the first person baptized was brother
[7:28] ezra
[7:30] in the horse trough amen and then
[7:33] we baptized levi and i mean they were so
[7:36] eager to fulfill the word of god
[7:38] and you know the there's there's risk
[7:41] for them to be baptized in the name of
[7:42] the lord jesus christ
[7:44] it's not it's not without risk it's not
[7:46] without peril because there's a definite
[7:49] a a definite risk of shunning
[7:52] a definite risk of being put out from
[7:54] the community and separated from their
[7:56] families over this
[7:57] but they wanted to keep the word then we
[8:00] baptized annie
[8:01] and annie was so excited to be baptized
[8:04] it was just it was just a privilege to
[8:06] baptize her in the name of the lord
[8:08] and then came barbara barbara's levi's
[8:11] wife
[8:11] and barbara i she's got i've told you
[8:14] before she's bound in a wheelchair she
[8:15] has some disease and i'm not sure i've
[8:17] never got
[8:18] the name but it seems like ms or
[8:20] something like ms
[8:22] and she has low muscle control and she
[8:24] was a little timid early on
[8:26] about getting baptized because she was
[8:27] just afraid of the community she was a
[8:29] little bit concerned about
[8:30] what some of the older ones with the
[8:32] elders and her parents and things would
[8:33] think
[8:34] but levi just went through the scripture
[8:35] with her and she saw it in a word and
[8:37] she wanted to be baptized according to
[8:39] the word
[8:40] so they helped her in they got out of
[8:42] the wheelchair helped her in to get
[8:43] baptized and
[8:45] and uh and i had levi help me he was on
[8:48] one side and
[8:49] we went to baptizer in the name of the
[8:51] lord jesus christ and
[8:52] as we baptize her because she has a low
[8:54] muscle tone low muscle control
[8:56] she opened her mouth and sucked water in
[8:59] and got really severely choked
[9:01] very very choked come out of the water
[9:03] we had to stand her up and she was
[9:05] she was gagging she was choked and it
[9:07] was really kind of a troubling scene
[9:10] there for a moment
[9:11] and i just in my heart i was concerned
[9:14] for barbara because i knew
[9:15] she had this concern and i and i knew
[9:18] the devil
[9:19] i know how the devil works and makes
[9:22] that a
[9:22] see you shouldn't have done that or this
[9:25] is not a good thing kind of you know
[9:26] we've all been there before
[9:28] and i was just concerned in my heart and
[9:31] and it was
[9:32] quite an episode took quite a while to
[9:33] get her out and get her settled down and
[9:35] in a chair
[9:36] maybe four or five minutes before she
[9:38] could quit choking quick coughing
[9:40] and settle down got a drink and i was
[9:42] just determined i laid hands on each one
[9:44] and prayed for him that the lord would
[9:45] fill him with the baptism of holy ghost
[9:47] and i was determined that we were not
[9:48] finished until we laid hands and prayed
[9:51] for
[9:51] so she was sitting in the chair and i
[9:53] just went over and i laid hands and
[9:55] prayed for and i began to pray
[9:56] for the lord of filler with his spirit
[9:58] filler with the baptism of the holy
[10:00] ghost according to his promise
[10:01] and i began to pray for her healing and
[10:03] i began to lay hands on her and pray
[10:05] but by the same stripes that purchased
[10:08] our salvation of the same that purchased
[10:10] our healing
[10:10] and there's nothing to hinder the
[10:12] healing of our sister because she's
[10:13] accepted the word
[10:15] and as i did that i could hear her
[10:17] responding
[10:18] amen and i could hear her responding
[10:20] loudly and when i opened my eyes she had
[10:22] her hands up in the air and she was
[10:24] praying
[10:25] in pennsylvania dutch i believe it was
[10:28] worshiping and praising the lord and i
[10:30] just thought praise god god made a turn
[10:32] around in that situation it didn't
[10:34] stumble her
[10:36] so then we left and we walked outside
[10:38] and back around to the front porch
[10:40] while they got changed into dry clothes
[10:42] and things and levi come out on the
[10:44] front porch
[10:45] and he began to share with us he said
[10:47] you know i should have
[10:48] he said i should have helped barbara i
[10:50] should have put my hand over her mouth
[10:51] she just
[10:52] she can't hold her muscles tight for
[10:54] very long and and he says and when she
[10:56] got choked because i was concerned for
[10:57] her
[10:58] he says but when you prayed for her she
[11:00] raised her hand to begin to worship out
[11:02] loud and praise the lord
[11:04] said she has never done that her whole
[11:06] life
[11:07] and she has never seen it done before
[11:10] because we don't do that in the amish
[11:12] church
[11:13] it was spontaneous worship and praise
[11:17] amen praise god
[11:19] [Applause]
[11:25] and when he told me that just something
[11:27] inside of me just broke and melted
[11:29] because it and what the devil could have
[11:31] used for evil amen's all of a sudden
[11:33] god under the under the outpouring of
[11:36] the spirit spontaneously with never
[11:38] seeing it done before
[11:39] never having done in her life raises her
[11:41] hand and begins to worship god out loud
[11:44] oh praise god he's the same guide
[11:46] yesterday today
[11:48] and forever amen the children of god do
[11:50] not have to be trained on how to worship
[11:52] god
[11:52] all they need is the spirit to fall and
[11:54] they begin to worship god
[11:56] so i am very excited for what god is
[11:59] going to do for this family just keep
[12:00] them in prayer
[12:01] amen he said if if he said who knows
[12:04] what will happen when the elders find
[12:06] out that they were baptized in the name
[12:07] of the lord jesus christ
[12:09] he said they very well could shun us all
[12:11] for that he goes but i don't know what
[12:12] will happen
[12:13] but but they chose to take the word and
[12:15] let god work it out
[12:17] so just be praying for them brother levi
[12:20] has a
[12:20] real strong burden for his people he
[12:23] knows
[12:24] he knows that he's subject to no
[12:26] ordinance of man
[12:28] he clearly he expressed it to us clearly
[12:30] he's under
[12:31] he's not subject to any rules any laws
[12:33] there's no binding there
[12:34] he said i know i could have a car i know
[12:36] i could have power tools
[12:38] i know i could have all of these things
[12:39] he says but i'm he reinforced the fact
[12:42] that i'm willing to subject myself to
[12:43] the ordinances
[12:44] to get the word to my brethren and so
[12:47] just pray for him pray that god will use
[12:49] his desire
[12:50] if he's got that design there's one soul
[12:52] there i pray god will connect the two
[12:54] and bring that one out and i appreciate
[12:57] your prayers appreciate your support
[12:59] it was a tremendous victory on monday
[13:02] afternoon
[13:03] and may god get all the glory and be
[13:05] praised for him
[13:06] amen i'm just thankful i thank god
[13:09] and you guys all have a part to play in
[13:12] them
[13:13] let's look here at ephesians chapter one
[13:15] as we get into the message for tonight
[13:18] i've got a real simple thought i want to
[13:19] share but it has profound impact on me
[13:22] as we look at these things and of course
[13:24] we're in the same vein of thought that
[13:26] we've been in but god just keeps opening
[13:28] up little pieces
[13:29] and we want to explore those in
[13:31] ephesians chapter 1 verse 3
[13:34] it says blessed be the god and father of
[13:36] our lord jesus christ who hath blessed
[13:38] us with all spiritual blessings
[13:40] in heavenly places in christ according
[13:43] as he has chosen us in him before the
[13:46] foundation of the world that we should
[13:48] be holy and without blame before him
[13:51] in love having predestinated us into the
[13:54] adoption of children by jesus christ
[13:56] to himself according to the pleasure of
[13:58] his will
[14:00] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[14:02] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[14:04] beloved
[14:05] in whom we have redemption through his
[14:07] blood the forgiveness of sins
[14:09] according to the riches of his grace
[14:12] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[14:14] all wisdom
[14:15] and prudence having made known unto us
[14:17] the mystery of his will
[14:18] according to his good pleasure which he
[14:20] hath purposed
[14:21] in himself that in the dispensation of
[14:24] the fullness of times he might gather
[14:26] together in one
[14:27] all things in christ both which are in
[14:29] heaven
[14:30] and which are in earth even in him in
[14:33] whom also we have obtained an
[14:34] inheritance being predestinated
[14:36] according to the purpose of him who
[14:38] worketh all things
[14:39] after the council of his own will that
[14:42] we should be to the praise of his glory
[14:44] who first trusted in christ
[14:46] in whom he also trusted after you heard
[14:49] the word of truth
[14:50] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[14:52] also after that you believed you were
[14:54] sealed with the holy spirit
[14:56] of promise so out of there i want to i
[14:59] want to take for a text
[15:01] he purposed and himself because we
[15:03] realized that
[15:05] everything we're a beneficiary of and
[15:07] everything we understand and the
[15:08] receiving of the message and receiving
[15:10] the word
[15:11] and the faith to believe is all because
[15:13] he purposed in himself
[15:16] he wasn't gone brother bam said god
[15:19] doesn't run his business
[15:21] uh inefficiently or in a bad way he said
[15:23] you businessmen wouldn't run your
[15:25] business this way
[15:26] you know just just hoping that things
[15:28] work out without any plan and without
[15:30] any foresight but he said god
[15:32] knew the end from the beginning he
[15:34] didn't just put out his word hoping
[15:36] someone would believe it
[15:37] he sent out his word knowing that there
[15:38] were those that were seed that was sown
[15:40] into the world
[15:41] that would receive it because he
[15:43] purposed it in himself
[15:44] everything's been working according to
[15:46] his purpose to the good pleasure of his
[15:48] will
[15:49] and so nothing's happening by
[15:51] happenstance and like we said before god
[15:53] is not adjusting
[15:55] according to the mood or the temperament
[15:57] or the political atmosphere
[15:59] i mean god is not adjusting his plan
[16:01] everything is adjusting to the will of
[16:03] god
[16:05] nations are rising and falling amen
[16:08] governments are shaking political
[16:10] systems are crumbling
[16:11] financial markets are rocking amen
[16:13] hurricanes are breaking out and fires
[16:15] all according to the will and purpose of
[16:18] god
[16:19] everything in this earth is moving
[16:21] according to his will and his purpose
[16:23] which he purposed
[16:24] in himself let's go back to genesis
[16:27] chapter one
[16:28] and let's let's look at a couple of
[16:29] verses here in genesis chapter one
[16:33] and verse one all the way into the
[16:34] beginning
[16:36] it's like we've been saying and the lord
[16:39] is making it more clear to me all the
[16:40] time
[16:41] that without understanding the beginning
[16:43] you'll never understand the end
[16:46] and and who was it that gave us
[16:48] understanding of the beginning
[16:50] amen it was a prophetic message that
[16:52] unlocked the seals
[16:53] and took the mystery off of this book
[16:55] amen so that we could see
[16:57] this beginning because a clear
[16:59] understanding of the beginning
[17:01] gives us a clear picture of what we're
[17:02] looking for in the end
[17:05] and chapter 1 verse 1 says in the
[17:08] beginning god created the heaven
[17:10] and the earth and the earth was without
[17:12] form and void and darkness was upon the
[17:14] face of the deep
[17:15] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[17:17] face of the waters
[17:18] and god said let there be light and
[17:20] there was light and god saw the light
[17:22] that it was good and god divided the
[17:24] light from the darkness
[17:28] now i think it's interesting and this
[17:31] just struck me just recently
[17:34] that god constructs everything so
[17:37] perfectly
[17:38] and when god is going to begin to tell
[17:41] his story when he's going to begin to
[17:43] lay down the scripture for us
[17:45] he starts with a world in destruction
[17:49] he doesn't start with perfection
[17:53] when god wants to tell a story he starts
[17:56] with a world
[17:57] that is steeped in darkness shrouded in
[17:59] darkness water covering the face of the
[18:01] deep
[18:02] in in chaos and in a state of judgment
[18:05] amen because we realize that this book
[18:07] is really the story of the seventh seal
[18:11] and so god is not trying to tell us god
[18:14] is not trying to tell us a creation
[18:15] story so we'll believe he's a creator
[18:18] we believe he's a creator he's telling
[18:21] us a creation story
[18:22] and he's also not telling a creation
[18:24] story amen for
[18:26] us to understand scientific facts
[18:30] [Music]
[18:31] see there's been so much debate you know
[18:34] there's still so much debate on 24-hour
[18:38] periods and
[18:38] periods of time and i'm talking debate
[18:41] in the christian community
[18:43] trying to take a scientific approach to
[18:46] the beginning
[18:47] to prove that god was god created all
[18:49] things
[18:50] and who are they trying to prove it to
[18:52] they're trying to prove it to
[18:53] unbelievers
[18:55] but god didn't write it amen to prove
[18:57] that he's the creator
[18:58] we know he's the creator we believe he's
[19:00] the creator amen there's something in us
[19:02] that can reach out
[19:03] and grab it we're not here looking for
[19:06] evidence in pieces
[19:07] to prove it amen it's been proven in our
[19:09] he's the creator
[19:11] so it wasn't written that this creation
[19:14] account was not written for scientific
[19:17] information amen that you can use to put
[19:19] the agnostics to rest
[19:23] it was written to tell his story of
[19:25] redemption
[19:27] it was written for us to understand
[19:29] ourselves and where we came from and who
[19:31] we
[19:31] are and what his purpose is for us this
[19:34] bible was not written for god's
[19:35] understanding this bible was written for
[19:37] our understanding
[19:40] and god didn't write this bible amen to
[19:42] reveal the secrets to himself
[19:44] amen he wrote this bible to reveal it to
[19:47] us
[19:49] because the revealing to us is also the
[19:51] awakening of our seed
[19:54] so now when when he starts here in
[19:56] genesis
[19:57] he starts with the world he starts by
[20:00] by just stating the the obvious a
[20:03] fundamental truth
[20:04] that in the beginning god created the
[20:05] heaven and the earth and brother of them
[20:07] tells us in the beginning could have
[20:08] been billions trillions it could have
[20:09] been whenever
[20:10] however long ago it was but there's
[20:12] something that takes place between verse
[20:14] 1 and verse 2
[20:15] and now we find that that great creation
[20:17] he created
[20:18] is in chaos covered in darkness and in a
[20:21] form of judgment
[20:24] amen and what god is showing you is that
[20:26] in the beginning he created you
[20:28] amen you amen you were in the beginning
[20:32] in the beginning of the creation of god
[20:34] you have a part in that
[20:36] amen just like this earth amen
[20:39] this earth wasn't created oh if we could
[20:42] see this earth wasn't created in chaos
[20:45] this word fell into create chaos neither
[20:47] were you in the mind of god created in
[20:49] chaos
[20:51] [Applause]
[20:53] but your earthly journey amen when we
[20:55] begin to tell the life
[20:57] of the story of your earthly journey you
[20:59] start off
[21:00] in chaos covered in darkness shrouded in
[21:04] water
[21:04] covered in darkness and a form of
[21:06] judgment
[21:08] so this bible is written so that god
[21:11] because brother bam said
[21:13] the opening of the seven seals at the
[21:14] end time was to take the mystery off of
[21:16] the bible
[21:17] the opening of the seven seals was to
[21:19] reveal the mystery of the word
[21:20] amen to do what to awaken the bride to
[21:23] bring her in position
[21:25] so this bible the whole bible not just
[21:27] certain portions
[21:28] but this whole bible all this scripture
[21:30] was written for this end time
[21:34] and now you were in the mind of god
[21:36] perfect amen
[21:37] you were part in the beginning of god
[21:40] you were part of the the beginning in
[21:42] the manifestation
[21:43] things that that we don't fully realize
[21:45] or fully understand
[21:46] and maybe not be able to fully explain
[21:49] amen but we were there
[21:50] amen part of god from before
[21:55] but because of judgment amen because of
[21:58] sin because of
[21:59] judgment our earthly journey starts with
[22:02] us covered over in water shrouded in
[22:04] darkness
[22:05] and chaos in spiritual amnesia
[22:09] in the chaos of sinful flesh and the
[22:12] chaos of a fallen nature
[22:14] and the chaos of judgment
[22:18] but then god
[22:23] then god said let there be light
[22:27] and there was light when god
[22:31] decided that it was time to move from a
[22:34] judgment state
[22:36] to an eden state he began to speak the
[22:40] word
[22:42] amen because when god decided it was
[22:45] time to take you from a judgment state
[22:47] to an eden state he began to give you
[22:50] the spoken word
[22:52] and the spoken word amen began to move
[22:56] things in our lives
[22:59] it says now let's look at verse two
[23:01] again and the earth was without form and
[23:02] void and darkness was upon the face of
[23:04] the deep
[23:05] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[23:07] face of the waters and god said let
[23:09] there be light
[23:10] and there was light and god saw the
[23:12] light that it was good and god divided
[23:14] the light from the darkness
[23:17] right from the beginning he sets a
[23:20] principle down
[23:21] in genesis that's going to be a
[23:22] principle that will be sustained
[23:24] throughout the scripture
[23:25] that his spoken word is light and that
[23:28] light
[23:29] brings separation between light and
[23:31] darkness
[23:34] see everything is written for a purpose
[23:37] and everything is placed in the right
[23:39] order
[23:40] for a purpose so god begins
[23:44] now by his spoken word he begins to
[23:46] bring an
[23:47] order to the chaos and he he begins to
[23:50] to
[23:50] to refashion the earth but he's not just
[23:53] refashioning the earth
[23:55] uh haphazardly but he's doing it with a
[23:59] purpose in mind
[24:00] so every step in the process every
[24:04] spoken word is working towards a finish
[24:06] line
[24:08] working towards a purpose
[24:11] and we know that it took brother bam
[24:13] tells us clearly that it took six
[24:14] thousand years six days six thousand
[24:17] years
[24:18] for him to to work by the spoken word
[24:21] and for the word to go forth and do the
[24:22] work
[24:23] and bring about uh uh on earth and get
[24:26] every all the ingredients and all the
[24:28] elements that he wanted
[24:30] because what he he wanted more than
[24:32] plants
[24:34] he wanted more than animals more than
[24:37] fish
[24:37] more than birds although that was part
[24:39] of the picture the picture was never
[24:41] completed
[24:42] amen and like we said before god could
[24:44] never move to rest
[24:46] until he the great artist finished his
[24:47] masterpiece
[24:49] so he's got to work on the masterpiece
[24:51] for 6 000 years
[24:53] and can never move to rest until he has
[24:55] the masterpiece finished
[24:57] so by the way the scriptures uh
[25:00] structured
[25:00] you begin to understand how god creates
[25:03] his masterpiece he brings his word he
[25:05] separates light and darkness
[25:07] and then he begins to speak things into
[25:09] existence that will bring an order of
[25:10] form
[25:11] amen to he's preparing amen a place he's
[25:14] preparing structure he's preparing
[25:16] animals he's preparing everything but
[25:18] the great preparation is so that he can
[25:20] have an eden
[25:21] and in that eden he can plant a garden
[25:23] he can have a specific
[25:24] place and in that he can place his son
[25:26] amen which is himself
[25:28] expressed and when his son
[25:32] is himself expressed within that son was
[25:34] male and female
[25:36] and that was an expression of god but we
[25:39] find out it was not
[25:40] a perfect expression of god
[25:43] because if that was a perfect expression
[25:45] of god he would have moved into his rest
[25:50] but because it was not a perfect
[25:51] expression of god
[25:53] amen now god has to continue working
[25:56] and when he continues working now he's
[25:58] got to take that sun
[25:59] which is an expression of him and he's
[26:02] got to lay that sun down and strike a
[26:04] blow to his side and pull out some
[26:06] ingredients
[26:07] and split the the feminist and masculine
[26:09] spirit
[26:10] and now he's got to form a woman out of
[26:12] the man
[26:13] amen and he's got to bring the two back
[26:15] together amen because christ the
[26:17] tree of life is going to be smitten and
[26:19] the bride tree is going to come
[26:21] out of the tree of life
[26:24] male and female two trees in the garden
[26:27] of eden
[26:29] the tree of life and the bride tree
[26:33] so now he cannot rest until he's
[26:36] finished the great purpose that he
[26:39] purposed within himself
[26:41] does that make sense if all he wanted
[26:45] was to have jesus christ if that's all
[26:48] his
[26:49] goal was just to have himself expressed
[26:52] in fullness in one man jesus christ
[26:54] who would come and fulfill all the law
[26:56] and pay the price of redemption for all
[26:58] that was lost if that's all he wanted
[27:00] he could have moved into his rest after
[27:02] he put adam and flesh and put him in the
[27:04] garden
[27:05] but because he didn't stop working there
[27:08] he knows he's declaring the end from the
[27:10] beginning
[27:11] he's not giving us scientific
[27:13] information
[27:14] he's telling us he's prefiguring he's
[27:17] shadowing
[27:18] the whole rest of the bible
[27:22] and so now if we just catch what he's
[27:26] doing
[27:26] amen and not get caught up and and well
[27:29] you know
[27:30] he has light and spoken with light and
[27:32] light and then plants and then you know
[27:34] we
[27:34] have plants for the animals to eat i
[27:36] mean just forget about all of that and
[27:38] see what he's actually doing
[27:41] he's taking 6 000 years amen and after 6
[27:44] 000 years what's he going to have at the
[27:46] end of 6 000 years
[27:48] he's going to have something that he's
[27:50] so satisfied with
[27:51] he looked at all that he made and
[27:53] everything that he'd done and he said
[27:54] this
[27:55] is very good and he went to his rest
[27:59] what was it it was it was everything
[28:02] that he had purposed to make to bring it
[28:04] up
[28:04] amen so that he could have the backdrop
[28:06] for his masterpiece
[28:08] which was a masterpiece family which was
[28:10] a man
[28:11] and a woman that were one amen placed in
[28:14] dominion as gods upon
[28:16] the earth
[28:25] now he goes into his
[28:29] rest because his work is done
[28:33] but now satan's going to slip in and
[28:36] through deception he's going to mar the
[28:38] image of god and it's going to collapse
[28:43] why because he started the story with
[28:46] the creation and collapse
[28:49] in ruin shadowed in darkness and now his
[28:52] great image falls into collapse
[28:54] falls into ruin amen but what's he going
[28:57] to do over
[28:58] the next 6 000 years
[29:02] he's going to bring it right back to his
[29:04] masterpiece again
[29:09] brother branham says
[29:13] now the sun this isn't the message it is
[29:16] the rising of the sun
[29:18] at the rising of the sun well there was
[29:19] a time when the world was laying in
[29:21] utter darkness
[29:23] it was without form and was void and it
[29:24] was all covered with water and was
[29:26] laying there in the dark dismal gloomy
[29:29] atmosphere and the spirit of god moved
[29:31] upon that water and said
[29:32] let there be light and god had a reason
[29:35] to do that for down beneath that water
[29:37] there was seeds that he had planted
[29:39] and they had to have that sunlight to
[29:41] make it live
[29:42] and the first light that was ever given
[29:44] in the earth was god's spoken word
[29:46] the first light that ever struck the
[29:48] earth was god's spoken word
[29:52] and i'd like to say that's the true
[29:53] light
[29:56] the sunlight is only a type of the true
[30:00] light but the spoken word of god is the
[30:02] true light
[30:03] and it is the true light that brings
[30:05] life to every true seed
[30:08] so the natural is only a reflection of
[30:11] the spiritual
[30:12] [Applause]
[30:14] the first light that ever struck the
[30:15] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[30:17] there be light and there was light
[30:19] that turned darkness and delight in
[30:21] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[30:23] and life upon the earth then the spirit
[30:26] of god as it moved with love and
[30:27] compassion at that great day the first
[30:29] day of the dawn of creation upon the
[30:31] earth
[30:32] see i want you to catch this the spirit
[30:35] of god
[30:36] as it moved with love and compassion
[30:40] see god's great purpose that he purposed
[30:42] he wasn't
[30:43] a cold formal creator
[30:47] i don't know any artist who's working on
[30:49] a piece of art i'm not an artist so i
[30:51] don't know
[30:52] but some of your artists how can an
[30:54] artist amen be
[30:56] forming something that comes from their
[30:58] heart they mean that comes from within
[31:00] them
[31:00] be working on something amen and not
[31:03] have a love
[31:04] for it not have a desire to it amen
[31:08] not be excited about seeing it it's
[31:10] fascinating it's coming together
[31:11] what's in my mind is starting to come
[31:13] into manifestation
[31:15] and there's an anticipation am i right
[31:18] brother nate
[31:19] i'm not an artist i don't know i'm just
[31:21] taking it for granted
[31:23] but there's an anticipation there's an
[31:25] expectation amen and as
[31:27] as you begin the the the the very image
[31:30] that was in your mind begins to take
[31:31] shape and begins to take form
[31:33] and becomes the manifestation there's an
[31:35] excitement there's an enthusiasm there's
[31:37] a love for the project
[31:39] there's a there's an inspiration that's
[31:41] boiling over amen don't think god was
[31:43] some formal
[31:44] god like a buddha sitting with his legs
[31:46] and arm crossed and then
[31:47] he has created create that create that
[31:49] let it all serve me no this was a
[31:51] this was a creation of love and
[31:53] compassion and
[31:54] joy and life upon the earth he was
[31:56] excited about what he was doing
[31:58] this was his purpose this was something
[31:59] that came from his heart
[32:03] the holy ghost was brooding over the
[32:04] earth brooding over the earth
[32:06] that's not a term that's cold and
[32:08] informal brooding amen
[32:10] is like a like a hen brooding over her
[32:12] chicks or
[32:13] are brooding over protecting and growing
[32:15] up and nurturing
[32:16] amen see the spirit of god hasn't moved
[32:21] with love and compassion at that great
[32:22] day the first day of dawn of creation
[32:24] upon the earth
[32:25] the sun rose and swept across its rays
[32:27] and dried up the waters from the earth
[32:29] and made an atmosphere above and for its
[32:31] first time it was to bring joy
[32:33] and life to the earth by a seed
[32:37] that was a great hour oh it wasn't
[32:40] nothing like that sunrise
[32:42] like the sunrise that easter morning
[32:44] this time with the sun leaping into the
[32:46] skies it brought forth a greater sunrise
[32:48] than ever
[32:49] because it came a greater news with this
[32:51] sunrise than it did when the sun
[32:54] rise at the beginning the sunrise
[32:56] brought a news that he has risen
[32:58] he is quickened from the dead as he
[33:00] promised he has risen from the dead
[33:03] the first time the sun rose in genesis
[33:05] it was bringing a message that there
[33:07] will be life upon the earth
[33:08] mortal life but this time when the sun
[33:11] rose there was a dual sunrise another
[33:13] sun rising
[33:14] it was not only the s-u-n rising it was
[33:16] the s-o-n had risen
[33:18] to bring eternal life to all god's
[33:20] promised seed that by foreknowledge
[33:22] he had seen laying upon the earth no
[33:24] more could the botany life live back
[33:26] there at the beginning with the s-u-n to
[33:28] without the s-u-n to bring it life no
[33:31] more than today when the sons of god
[33:33] is upon the earth it takes the esso in
[33:36] light to bring them to eternal life
[33:38] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[33:41] foundation of the world
[33:42] he had chosen them in himself before the
[33:45] foundation of the world
[33:47] now when god
[33:51] was working his creation
[33:55] he had a purpose that he purposed within
[33:57] himself
[33:59] he was not taking counsel he wasn't
[34:02] learning as he went
[34:03] he had a a purpose within his within
[34:06] himself
[34:07] and everything he spoke amen was moving
[34:10] everything in life according to his
[34:12] purpose
[34:14] everything was was coming into a certain
[34:16] fashion to a certain form
[34:18] to a certain placing amen according to
[34:20] his purpose
[34:21] amen and then when god signifies when he
[34:24] looks at everything
[34:25] all that he had made and all that he had
[34:27] done he said it is very good then he can
[34:29] rest
[34:30] signifying that he had he had fulfilled
[34:33] his purpose
[34:34] what he had planned what he had desired
[34:36] with that great
[34:37] love and compassion that was being
[34:38] expressed was now fulfilled
[34:40] and he had a he had a son and his son's
[34:43] bride
[34:44] amen they had adam male and female
[34:47] husband and wife
[34:48] upon the earth as gods upon the earth
[34:50] reflecting on the earth
[34:51] what was going on in heaven
[34:53] [Music]
[34:55] and he would come down in the cool of
[34:57] the evening and he would begin
[34:59] he began to walk with him in the cool of
[35:01] the day having perfect fellowship with
[35:03] his family with his children
[35:04] amen and it was it was god's purpose
[35:06] god's desire what god had worked for
[35:08] what he wanted
[35:11] but he knew it would fall
[35:14] he knew it would fall and
[35:17] out of the ashes out of the ruin he
[35:20] would start making his masterpiece again
[35:24] and he would start with the man jesus
[35:26] christ and he started
[35:28] through the old testament through moses
[35:30] and the prophets and
[35:31] uh the patriarchs and the prophets and
[35:34] he was what was he doing
[35:35] he was building back this fallen
[35:37] masterpiece again
[35:39] and he can't rest
[35:43] listen he can't rest
[35:47] until he gets it all back to where it's
[35:49] supposed to be
[35:52] he can't rest till every attribute of
[35:54] that bride
[35:55] every member of that bride is united
[35:58] back with the bridegroom again
[36:00] he cannot move to the millennium to the
[36:02] thousand year rest he cannot go
[36:04] there amen until after he's finished his
[36:07] work
[36:07] he's not laying down on the job amen
[36:10] he's not leaving it to itself
[36:12] amen but god is here giving out a spoken
[36:15] word
[36:15] and the spoken word is bringing light
[36:17] and bringing life and putting everything
[36:19] in our lives in order
[36:20] to bring the seed up to life to bring us
[36:22] back to that image that he had from the
[36:24] very beginning
[36:26] god is re it's what we're in is a repeat
[36:32] of genesis first couple of chapters of
[36:35] genesis
[36:39] brother ben says in 1957 the message
[36:41] titled love
[36:43] see the reason i chose this tonight is
[36:44] because my theme has
[36:46] always been love i think love is the
[36:49] most powerful force that the world has
[36:52] because god is love and there's no more
[36:56] powerful force than god and love is one
[36:58] of the greatest things that i could
[37:00] speak of
[37:02] he says in a message in 1960 god's
[37:04] provided way of approach to fellowship
[37:06] he said love is the most powerful force
[37:08] there is
[37:09] in the world there's nothing as great as
[37:12] love
[37:13] power only lays in love and it's amazing
[37:16] brother brahm said
[37:17] this was a creation of love and
[37:19] compassion it was
[37:21] god's love being expressed amen
[37:25] and god
[37:28] god purposed in himself
[37:32] because of his love that this is what he
[37:35] wants
[37:36] this is his desire his love expressed
[37:39] i mean his love expressed is a man and
[37:42] woman
[37:42] in dominion is god's on the earth that's
[37:45] the expression of his great love
[37:48] and i i'd say it this way god is love
[37:51] and god's purpose i'm just want to
[37:54] rephrase not to change what brother
[37:55] brahm said but god's purpose
[37:57] is the greatest force because god's
[38:00] purpose is his love
[38:02] his love brings his purpose and his
[38:05] purpose is the greatest force
[38:06] and the quiet the question i have
[38:08] tonight that
[38:09] it's it's it's a question that we all
[38:11] know the answer to intuitively
[38:13] but it's worth asking amen what
[38:16] in the world can resist his purpose
[38:21] when god said let there be light was
[38:23] there any possibility of light not
[38:25] coming forth
[38:26] it may have taken hundreds of years
[38:28] brother benham said he said it could
[38:30] have been 700 years before the light
[38:32] appeared but there was an impossibility
[38:34] for there not to be light
[38:37] right and brother bam said you know when
[38:39] he began to say
[38:40] let there be plants and trees he said it
[38:42] may have been hundreds of years
[38:44] before that word came into a perfect
[38:46] manifestation
[38:47] but it's an impossibility for the word
[38:50] not to be made manifest
[38:51] because he purposed it in himself and
[38:53] his his purpose
[38:55] is his love expressed and his love is
[38:58] expressed as his purpose
[38:59] and his purpose is the greatest force
[39:01] there ever is
[39:04] nothing can resist the will of god or
[39:05] the purpose of god
[39:09] do you realize that there was no
[39:13] possibility in the book of genesis
[39:16] and the creation account in 6 000 years
[39:19] there was
[39:20] no possibility to miss the bride
[39:25] because it was part of his purpose it
[39:28] was
[39:28] an impossibility that god would not
[39:32] bring forth a bride and unite the two
[39:34] together amen
[39:36] and and leave them as gods in eden that
[39:38] was an impossibility because it was his
[39:40] purpose
[39:43] if that was his purpose then
[39:46] that's his love expressed that's his
[39:48] purpose that's the force that's moving
[39:50] everything that's moving now
[39:51] and it's an impossibility that he will
[39:54] not have a bride on this earth that is
[39:56] without spot or wrinkle
[39:58] it's an impossibility he won't finish
[40:00] his work here
[40:01] in the sixth day
[40:04] we've come to the end of the sixth day
[40:08] six thousand years let's look at
[40:11] ephesians
[40:12] chapter two
[40:20] i wanna look at a couple scriptures and
[40:22] then move from there ephesians chapter
[40:24] 2.
[40:25] we're going to start at verse 1.
[40:31] and you hatha quickened who were dead in
[40:33] trespasses and sins
[40:35] you were in genesis 1 2.
[40:39] you had the quickened who were in
[40:41] genesis 1 2.
[40:44] amen where and in time past you walked
[40:46] according to the course of this world
[40:48] according to the prince of the power of
[40:49] the air
[40:50] the spirit that now worketh in the
[40:52] children of disobedience
[40:53] so now he's telling you you were in this
[40:57] fallen condition like genesis 1 2.
[41:01] you had the quickened who were dead in
[41:03] trespasses and sin where in time past
[41:05] you walked according to the course of
[41:07] this world according to the prince of
[41:09] the power of the air
[41:10] the spirit thou now worketh in the
[41:11] children of disobedience
[41:13] you were no different than them
[41:18] at least in the outward
[41:21] among whom also we all had our
[41:24] conversation in time past
[41:26] and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[41:28] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[41:30] we're by nature the children of wrath
[41:32] even as others but god who is rich in
[41:35] mercy
[41:36] for his great love
[41:39] not because he felt sorry for us
[41:43] not you realize this was all according
[41:46] to his purpose
[41:47] he found us the same place he found the
[41:49] earth
[41:50] amen in his great purpose and his love
[41:52] and his compassion
[41:53] nurtured and brooded over that earth and
[41:55] spoke the word to get it to
[41:57] to fulfill his purpose and his purpose
[42:00] was expressed
[42:01] in adam and his bride upon the earth and
[42:03] now he
[42:04] finds you in the same place
[42:10] and then he begins to work through a
[42:12] spoken word amen
[42:19] god who is rich in mercy for his great
[42:21] love wherewith he loved us
[42:22] even when we were dead in sins hath
[42:25] quickened us together with christ
[42:27] by grace you're saved and hath raised us
[42:30] up together and made us sit together in
[42:31] heavenly places in christ jesus
[42:34] that in the ages to come he might show
[42:36] the exceeding riches of his grace
[42:38] and his kindness towards us through
[42:40] christ jesus for by grace are you saved
[42:42] through faith
[42:43] in that not of yourselves it is the gift
[42:45] of god not of works lest any
[42:48] man should boast so god's great love was
[42:51] going to be expressed to us to fulfill
[42:53] his purpose
[42:53] he was going to take his word and he was
[42:55] going to turn our chaos
[42:57] into a garden in our soul
[43:01] a garden where he can have christ and
[43:04] his bride together
[43:07] and where he himself can come and walk
[43:09] and have fellowship praise be to god
[43:13] i say god do that to me do that to me
[43:18] but see his his
[43:22] grace for by grace are you saved
[43:25] through faith so now god is bringing us
[43:28] to this place
[43:30] by faith by faith in his word but you
[43:32] realize that faith in his word
[43:34] amen it it gives us a chance to get a
[43:38] hold of his grace
[43:39] his grace is his love expressed to us
[43:41] it's his great love his great force
[43:43] his great purpose is his grace
[43:47] and he's given us the faith you're saved
[43:50] by grace
[43:51] through faith and not none of yourselves
[43:53] it is a gift of god
[43:54] and so now we have within us amen the
[43:57] seed that is planted
[43:58] that gives us the mechanism by which we
[44:01] can get a hold of this great purpose of
[44:03] god
[44:03] that's purposed out there when the light
[44:05] has come that the light is not going to
[44:07] quicken brother brahma said
[44:08] every seed to life but it's only going
[44:11] to quicken the seeds
[44:12] that have already been germinated and
[44:15] there's germinated seeds and those
[44:16] germinated seeds are the predestinated
[44:18] seeds
[44:19] and the predestinated seas as the light
[44:21] moves across as the word comes
[44:23] amen to call them out those germinated
[44:25] seeds down there have a capacity to
[44:28] believe the word
[44:30] and that capacity to believe the word
[44:32] begins to get that seed to respond to
[44:35] the light
[44:36] into the water of the word for the age
[44:38] and it begins to bring it out
[44:40] all the potential that's laying in that
[44:42] seed begins to manifest
[44:43] in this great recreation
[44:50] go to romans chapter 4 and i just want
[44:52] to reinforce this
[44:53] before i move to any more thought
[44:58] romans chapter 4
[45:02] verse 9. we know this quite well but i
[45:05] just i really love this passage of
[45:07] scripture
[45:08] he said come at this blessedness upon
[45:10] the circumcision only or upon the
[45:12] uncircumcision also for we say that
[45:15] faith was reckoned to abraham for
[45:17] righteousness
[45:19] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[45:21] circumcision or in uncircumcision
[45:23] not in circumcision but in
[45:24] uncircumcision
[45:26] so what he's saying is is abraham was
[45:29] declared
[45:29] righteous by god part of the right to
[45:31] see because he could believe god's word
[45:34] when was he able to receive god's word
[45:36] was it when he was circumcised or
[45:38] uncircumcised
[45:39] he received it when he was uncircumcised
[45:41] foreshadowing that there would be a
[45:43] royal seat of abraham
[45:44] we were not part of the circumcision who
[45:47] could receive the word of god
[45:48] and when they believed the word of god
[45:50] it was counted unto them for
[45:51] righteousness
[45:54] why because by grace are you saved
[45:55] through faith and not on yourselves it's
[45:57] a gift of god
[46:00] now he says
[46:03] and he received a sign of circumcision a
[46:06] seal of the righteousness of the faith
[46:07] which he had
[46:08] yet being uncircumcised and he might be
[46:11] the father of all them that believe
[46:12] though they be not circumcised
[46:14] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[46:17] them also
[46:19] and the father of circumcision to them
[46:20] who are not of the circumcision only
[46:23] but who also walk on the steps of that
[46:25] faith of our father abraham
[46:27] which he had being yet uncircumcised for
[46:30] the promise that he should be heir of
[46:32] the world was not to abraham
[46:34] or to his seed through the law but
[46:36] through the righteousness
[46:37] of faith this is where brother branham
[46:40] takes this portion of scripture right
[46:41] now
[46:42] and right here and he begins to tell you
[46:44] that you are the royal seed of abraham
[46:47] amen that you have every right to every
[46:49] promise that was given to abraham
[46:51] and abraham was told he would possess
[46:53] the gates of his enemy
[46:54] and he would be heir to all of creation
[46:58] and how so amen not by becoming a
[47:01] natural seed from a natural lineage
[47:03] amen but becoming a faith seed by
[47:06] believing the same faith that abraham
[47:08] had
[47:08] if you have that same faith then you are
[47:10] the faith seed of abraham
[47:12] and you have a right to every promise
[47:14] that was given to abraham
[47:16] because god gave promises to abraham
[47:18] although they were manifest in a fleshly
[47:21] natural way
[47:22] the promises were a spiritual promise
[47:26] for a royal seed to come into a
[47:30] full revelation in a full manifestation
[47:34] and what was it recognized by faith
[47:39] verse 14 for if they which are of the
[47:41] law be heirs faith is made void
[47:43] and the promise of none effect because
[47:45] the law worketh wrath
[47:47] for where no law is there is no
[47:49] transgression
[47:50] see this is such a beautiful passage of
[47:52] scripture
[47:53] because god is such a righteous god
[47:56] that he even gave cain an opportunity
[48:00] at salvation now he wasn't ever
[48:04] this is just now just let brother chad
[48:06] speak for a minute he wasn't
[48:08] ever going to turn cain he wasn't ever
[48:12] going to turn
[48:12] cain into an elect seed
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] but he told cain if you'll just do as
[48:19] abel does want it be well with thee
[48:22] and if god told him he'd be well with
[48:23] him then it was going to be well with
[48:24] him he was offering a form of salvation
[48:27] to cain
[48:29] god wasn't playing games with cain he
[48:31] wasn't mentioning words if cain would
[48:33] have only been
[48:34] able to do what abel did he would have
[48:36] got some form of reward he said it will
[48:37] be well with thee
[48:39] but there was nothing inside of cain to
[48:41] be able to receive the word
[48:43] in fact he hated it and he fought
[48:45] against it
[48:47] but the seed of god is able
[48:50] god is so righteous that he still offers
[48:53] for whosoever would believe
[48:54] amen knowing that his seed is the only
[48:57] one capable of believing
[48:59] but in order to pass righteous judgment
[49:02] and stay just
[49:02] he's got to give an opportunity there
[49:05] and the requirement
[49:06] is to be able to receive the word for
[49:08] your day
[49:10] and anybody anybody has an
[49:14] opportunity to receive the word for
[49:16] their day
[49:17] amen but he brings the word in such an
[49:19] odd way
[49:20] he brings it so contrary to common
[49:22] thinking he brings it so
[49:24] backward to theological teaching that
[49:26] there's no way
[49:27] that anybody's going to receive it
[49:29] unless they already have the receiver on
[49:32] the inside
[49:34] to prove that they are a royal seat of
[49:36] abraham to prove that they are part of
[49:37] this recreation
[49:38] to prove that this is his purpose that
[49:40] he purposed within himself
[49:42] this is the one that i'm after and i'm
[49:44] going to be just i'm going to give
[49:46] the world the same opportunity cain had
[49:49] praise
[49:52] oh praise god friends
[49:57] all you have to do is believe god amen
[50:02] which part of god the current
[50:06] present tense i am
[50:12] i want to tell you this when you come in
[50:13] contact with i am you've come in contact
[50:15] with all of god
[50:21] if you only know a god that was you only
[50:24] have
[50:24] part of god
[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] because you're leaving off the present
[50:30] day part and that's partial amen
[50:32] impartial is not working
[50:33] and remember the only way to get the
[50:35] full measure is when you find the i
[50:37] am and come in contact with the i am you
[50:40] have everything he was and everything he
[50:42] will be
[50:42] is expressed here and i am and when you
[50:45] get a hold of god as i
[50:46] am that you've got god
[50:52] and god set his system up that when you
[50:55] can come in contact with the i am
[50:57] those royal seat of abraham all through
[51:00] the bible
[51:01] were able to recognize god present tense
[51:04] i am and they were able to respond by
[51:07] faith
[51:09] proving they were seed of abraham see
[51:12] let's go on here just a little bit
[51:14] further
[51:17] verse 15 because the law worketh wrath
[51:19] for whether no law is there is no
[51:21] transgression
[51:22] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[51:25] by grace
[51:26] to the end the promise might be sure to
[51:29] all the seed
[51:32] it's a purpose he purposed within
[51:34] himself
[51:35] tell me what will stop his purpose
[51:39] i want to tell you something right now
[51:40] your confused mind
[51:42] you're learning false doctrine you're
[51:44] getting twisted in your mind by false
[51:46] things will never stop his purpose
[51:48] his purpose is greater than your mind
[51:50] his purpose is greater than your past
[51:52] his purpose is greater than abuses
[51:54] and all kinds his purpose is greater and
[51:56] he already put something down in there
[51:58] that's going to be able to catch the
[52:00] word for the day
[52:01] to see the i am and say that's nothing
[52:03] but the truth
[52:05] and when we're able to do that he says
[52:07] that's my boy
[52:08] that's my girl that's my purpose being
[52:11] expressed in this day
[52:17] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[52:18] by grace to the end the promise might be
[52:20] sure to all
[52:22] the seed it's a sure thing
[52:27] not to that only which is of the law but
[52:29] to also that which is of the faith of
[52:30] abraham
[52:31] who is the father of us all as it is
[52:34] written i have made thee a father of
[52:35] many nations before him
[52:37] whom he believed even god who quickened
[52:40] the dead and calleth those things which
[52:42] be not as though they are they were who
[52:45] against hope believed in hope
[52:46] that he might become the father of many
[52:48] nations according to
[52:50] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[52:52] be and being not weak in faith he
[52:54] considered not his own body now
[52:56] dead when he was about a hundred years
[52:58] old neither yet the
[52:59] deadness of sarah's womb he staggered
[53:02] not at the promise of god
[53:03] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[53:05] giving glory to god
[53:07] and being fully persuaded that he had
[53:09] pro that
[53:10] that what he had promised he was able
[53:12] also to perform
[53:13] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[53:16] righteousness
[53:19] it wasn't abraham's righteous deeds
[53:24] that made abraham righteous
[53:28] his righteousness was an imputed
[53:30] righteousness which means put on
[53:31] god put on him righteousness because he
[53:34] believed god
[53:35] because when he goes down to gerrard he
[53:37] lies
[53:39] you understand abraham he and he's god
[53:42] calls him a prophet in that episode
[53:44] he says he's my prophet he's a prophet
[53:46] of god he's the roy he's the seed of god
[53:48] amen he's establishing the faith seed of
[53:50] god amen
[53:51] and the promises are laying in abraham
[53:53] and abraham goes down to gerar
[53:56] after a body change
[54:02] and he lies and says this is my sister
[54:04] tell him you're my sister
[54:06] and works all of this out and god comes
[54:08] to abimelech
[54:09] abimelech is acting righteously
[54:12] abimelech is righteous by deeds
[54:17] but he's not at the same level abraham
[54:20] as
[54:20] abraham is unrighteous by deeds
[54:23] abimelech
[54:24] is righteous by deeds but god declares
[54:26] abraham righteous by
[54:28] faith apart from deeds
[54:33] why because there's going to be a couple
[54:35] thousand years later
[54:36] come a sacrificial lamb that'll cover
[54:39] abraham's wrong
[54:40] deeds amen but there's nothing that can
[54:43] cover for no
[54:44] faith for a disbelief and an unbelief in
[54:47] the word of god
[54:48] there is no sacrifice that will cover
[54:50] for unbelief there's only a sacrifice
[54:53] that will cover for deeds
[54:56] not for unbelief
[54:58] [Music]
[55:01] so abimelech is acting righteous that's
[55:04] why government and reformation is never
[55:07] going to produce a seed of god
[55:08] it is never going to produce a bride
[55:10] there's no reformation we're not
[55:12] reformers
[55:13] we're not trying to change people's
[55:14] lives by being kind and nice to them and
[55:17] encourage them and have a buddy system
[55:19] amen the only way to change their life
[55:20] is give them the word of god if they
[55:22] take the word of god the spirit of god
[55:24] will come and they will be changed
[55:26] [Music]
[55:28] man we're not here to counsel you long
[55:30] counsel your law counsel you alone
[55:32] that's human efforts and human efforts
[55:34] will fail
[55:34] we are here to take the word and put the
[55:36] word in the situation
[55:37] when you receive that word there's a
[55:40] life that comes at that word
[55:41] and it has the power of transformation
[55:44] and if there's a seed of god in there
[55:46] that can receive that word
[55:48] amen that's got a power of
[55:50] transformation already
[55:51] built into the seed i don't care how low
[55:54] down
[55:55] your flesh has been and i don't care how
[55:57] vile and what kind of vile acts that you
[56:00] have died
[56:00] i don't care how shameful and
[56:02] embarrassed amen your life has been
[56:04] the power of transformation is not in
[56:06] your mind the power of transformation is
[56:08] in that seed and all that seed needs is
[56:11] the light the spoken word of god
[56:13] to hit that seed and it'll come to life
[56:16] and the power to transform
[56:18] wrong thinking wrong actions wrong
[56:20] habits is already there
[56:23] it was put in you before the foundation
[56:25] of the world when your name was put in
[56:26] the lamb's book of life
[56:27] god was ensuring that his purpose would
[56:29] not be defeated
[56:30] when he put a portion of himself and
[56:33] attributed to you to come forth in this
[56:35] day
[56:35] he was guaranteeing that nothing would
[56:37] disrupt his plan
[56:43] why because before he allowed this earth
[56:46] to fall into chaos after genesis 1
[56:48] i don't know what happened but something
[56:50] happened and he allowed it to happen
[56:52] because he was foreshadowing what was
[56:54] going to happen to you
[56:57] and before the chaos broke out that
[56:59] would have an earth
[57:01] and judgment and chaos he made sure
[57:03] there was some good seeds that got down
[57:05] in that ground
[57:06] so nothing would defeat his purpose
[57:12] amen amen it's not
[57:15] you it's him get the whole idea of you
[57:18] out of the picture
[57:19] all this idea of i can't do it and i
[57:20] can't live enough and i've tried and
[57:22] failed
[57:22] forget it just surrender to the word and
[57:25] say god give me all of that word
[57:27] every bit that i can get and stay with
[57:30] the word friends
[57:32] i've seen so many people jump in and
[57:34] jump out jump in and jump out and jump
[57:36] in and jump out and say i just can't
[57:37] have victory i just can't stop failing
[57:39] you stick with the word don't leave it
[57:41] no matter what happens
[57:42] how discouraged you get how bad how much
[57:45] sin and backsliding you
[57:47] stay with that word until it changes
[57:49] your life
[57:50] because the seed of god will stay with
[57:52] that word they won't leave it they'll
[57:54] stick with it and the power of
[57:56] transformation will
[57:57] change that life
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:02] amen
[58:06] what do we need we need to have
[58:07] confidence in what god the way god
[58:09] brings the seed up the way god brings
[58:11] life
[58:12] is by a spoken word
[58:13] [Music]
[58:16] amen we're always trying to find
[58:19] somebody to help us and somebody to fix
[58:20] us and somebody to talk
[58:22] to me
[58:26] what we need is to have confidence if
[58:29] i'm a seed of god
[58:31] everything i need he's placed in that
[58:35] seat and he can unlock it by his spirit
[58:40] i need to stay in the atmosphere of the
[58:42] word
[58:45] let's read verse 21 again and being
[58:49] fully persuaded that what he had
[58:50] promised he was able to perform
[58:52] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[58:54] righteousness
[58:55] now it was not written for his sake
[58:57] alone that it was imputed to him
[58:59] but for us also
[59:03] i hope that thrills your soul amen i
[59:06] hope it thrills you
[59:07] that that abraham could believe god he
[59:10] could believe god's promise believe
[59:11] god's word grow stronger in faith amen
[59:13] get a body change
[59:14] meet god in flesh recognize god and
[59:17] flesh get a body change go to career and
[59:19] lie
[59:20] and still have righteousness imputed
[59:22] unto him
[59:23] i hope that thrills your soul because it
[59:25] thrills mine because god didn't just do
[59:27] that for abraham he did it for all of
[59:29] abraham's seed and if you're abraham's
[59:31] faith seeth he's got you
[59:33] in the same place he's got abraham
[59:37] and he didn't do it just for abraham he
[59:39] did it for you and i
[59:41] as well
[59:45] it was not written for his sake alone
[59:46] that it was imputed to him
[59:48] but for us also to whom it shall be
[59:51] imputed
[59:52] if we believe on him that raised up
[59:53] jesus our lord from the dead
[59:56] who was delivered for our offenses and
[59:58] was raised again for our justification
[1:00:02] i want to take a good look at this
[1:00:03] scripture so nobody goes to the
[1:00:04] denominational idea
[1:00:08] it says but for us also verse 24
[1:00:12] to whom it shall be imputed if we
[1:00:13] believe on him
[1:00:16] that raised up jesus our lord from the
[1:00:17] dead it didn't say
[1:00:19] if you believe he raised up jesus from
[1:00:21] the dead
[1:00:23] read it again because the denominations
[1:00:27] would like you'd like to say
[1:00:28] if you believe that he raised jesus from
[1:00:30] the dead then it's imputed unto you for
[1:00:31] righteousness you're saved
[1:00:33] that's not what the word says
[1:00:36] it says if we believe on him
[1:00:39] that raised up jesus our lord who is him
[1:00:42] it's god the word
[1:00:43] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:00:45] word was with god and the word was god
[1:00:47] and if you want to have the same
[1:00:49] imputation of rights that abraham had
[1:00:51] you have to believe on him the word amen
[1:00:54] that raised up a that raised up jesus
[1:00:56] christ from the dead
[1:00:59] it's not enough just to believe that god
[1:01:01] raised jesus from the dead
[1:01:02] billions believe that but you must
[1:01:06] believe on
[1:01:06] him who raised jesus from the dead
[1:01:10] who raised jesus from the dead the
[1:01:12] spoken word of god because he said
[1:01:15] after three days
[1:01:21] praise be to god
[1:01:25] brother branham says in the smyrnan
[1:01:27] church age
[1:01:29] out of the church age book so they are
[1:01:32] like the children of israel who come out
[1:01:34] of egypt and stop
[1:01:35] short of the promised land now those
[1:01:37] children of israel left
[1:01:38] egypt about 2 million strong they all
[1:01:41] journeyed together
[1:01:42] all saw the same miracles of god all
[1:01:43] partook of the same man and water from
[1:01:45] the smitten rod
[1:01:46] all followed the same cloud by day in
[1:01:48] the pillar of fire by night
[1:01:50] but only two reached the promised land
[1:01:53] only two were true or real believers
[1:01:56] that is correct because the word tells
[1:01:58] us that the rest died because of
[1:02:00] unbelief
[1:02:00] and because of unbelief they could not
[1:02:02] enter in hebrews 3
[1:02:04] 19 then since that is so and only two
[1:02:07] entered
[1:02:07] the rest were not true believers
[1:02:11] what made the difference two stayed with
[1:02:14] the word
[1:02:18] also was not based on conduct
[1:02:21] it was based on faith and faith
[1:02:25] influenced their conduct
[1:02:29] when the heart of the ten spies failed
[1:02:31] at cadiz barnea joshua and caleb did not
[1:02:33] stagger
[1:02:33] for they believed the word and said we
[1:02:35] are more than able to take the land
[1:02:37] they knew they could because god had
[1:02:39] said i have given you the lamb
[1:02:40] after all those israelites saw the power
[1:02:43] of the goodness and deliverance of god
[1:02:45] they did not enter into rest which is a
[1:02:47] type of the holy ghost
[1:02:49] so you can see right now that very few
[1:02:51] will ever believe all the way to
[1:02:52] receiving the spirit of god
[1:02:55] all right we have come this far now i
[1:02:56] want to go further and when i do i know
[1:02:58] i'm going to cause some emotions to rise
[1:03:01] but that is something i am not
[1:03:02] responsible for i am responsible to god
[1:03:05] in his word and the people god has sent
[1:03:06] me to
[1:03:08] i have to be faithful in all he gives me
[1:03:10] to say
[1:03:11] in john chapter 6 verse 37 and verse 44
[1:03:14] it says
[1:03:14] all that the father giveth me shall come
[1:03:17] to me and him that cometh to me i
[1:03:19] shall know wise cast out no man can come
[1:03:22] to me except the father draw
[1:03:24] him and i will raise him up in the last
[1:03:26] day
[1:03:27] john 1 12 and 13 but as many as received
[1:03:30] him
[1:03:31] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:03:33] of god even to them that believe on his
[1:03:35] name
[1:03:35] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:03:37] will of the flesh nor the will of the
[1:03:39] man
[1:03:39] but of god ephesians 1 4 and 5 according
[1:03:43] as he has chosen
[1:03:45] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:03:46] world that we should be holy
[1:03:48] and without blame before him in love
[1:03:50] having predestinated us unto the
[1:03:52] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:03:54] himself
[1:03:55] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:03:56] will now without getting too involved in
[1:03:59] the subject of the sovereignty of god
[1:04:01] for that would take a book in itself let
[1:04:03] me point out here that according to
[1:04:05] these verses
[1:04:06] jesus christ is choosing his own bride
[1:04:10] just the same as men choose their brides
[1:04:12] today
[1:04:17] the bride today the bride today does not
[1:04:20] simply decide she's going to take a
[1:04:21] certain man for her husband no sir
[1:04:23] it's the groom who decides and chooses a
[1:04:25] certain woman for his bride
[1:04:28] i love this because if god
[1:04:33] has called your name by revealing the
[1:04:34] mysteries
[1:04:36] you're his bride and you didn't choose
[1:04:39] him he chose you
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:42] if you have a a receiver a crystal on
[1:04:45] the inside
[1:04:46] that can pick up the radio signal that's
[1:04:48] coming from heaven
[1:04:50] coming from the word then that means
[1:04:52] you're the predestinated one you're the
[1:04:54] elect you're the child of god you're the
[1:04:55] seed you're the bride
[1:04:57] and you didn't put the receiver inside
[1:04:59] you didn't choose to receive
[1:05:01] even choosing you could never receive
[1:05:03] and pretending you can never get it
[1:05:06] but it has to be there predestinated
[1:05:09] john 15 16 says you have not chosen me
[1:05:12] but i have chosen you he's looking at
[1:05:14] his disciples
[1:05:15] and he says you haven't chosen me i
[1:05:17] chose you
[1:05:20] was peter looking for jesus or jesus
[1:05:22] looking for peter
[1:05:26] jesus came to peter washing his nets
[1:05:30] and said come follow me i mean
[1:05:35] jesus knew where zacchaeus was in the
[1:05:38] truth
[1:05:39] zacchaeus thought he could hide and look
[1:05:42] at jesus
[1:05:44] but jesus knew where zacchaeus was and
[1:05:46] called to him to come down
[1:05:48] he says you haven't chosen me but i've
[1:05:50] chosen you god
[1:05:51] knew where you were hiding
[1:05:54] god knew what tree you were hiding in
[1:05:58] he knew what methodist tree and what
[1:05:59] baptistry and what fig leaves you were
[1:06:01] hiding behind
[1:06:05] he knew where you were you didn't choose
[1:06:07] him he chose you
[1:06:10] he goes on in this course he says now
[1:06:11] according to the word of god the bride
[1:06:13] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:06:15] world
[1:06:16] the choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:06:18] in himself ephesians 1 9.
[1:06:20] and in romans 9 11 it says that the
[1:06:23] purpose of god according to election
[1:06:24] might stand
[1:06:26] you can't read it any other way i read
[1:06:29] this quote
[1:06:30] two weeks ago or something like that but
[1:06:33] just catch this
[1:06:35] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[1:06:38] god
[1:06:39] was to take a bride of his own chosen
[1:06:48] if you want to get to the heart of it
[1:06:51] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[1:06:55] god
[1:06:55] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[1:07:00] not everyone who says lord lord
[1:07:03] that's not what he wanted do you
[1:07:06] understand what i'm saying
[1:07:08] he did not want everybody that would
[1:07:10] attach to religion that would have an
[1:07:12] intellectual understanding
[1:07:13] but he wanted a bride of his own
[1:07:17] choosing so he had to make sure he had a
[1:07:21] mechanism in place
[1:07:23] so that only his bride would come
[1:07:29] oh i tell you friends there there are
[1:07:31] some times that i get discouraged and i
[1:07:33] get discouraged sometimes
[1:07:35] because some people would like to take
[1:07:37] the message
[1:07:38] and filter it through apologetics to
[1:07:40] make it palatable and easy to explain
[1:07:43] god is not looking for people to agree
[1:07:46] with the message he's looking for a
[1:07:47] bride of his own choosing
[1:07:50] and he set the parameters for choosing
[1:07:53] and that choosing was going to be by
[1:07:54] faith in the i am his present tense word
[1:07:56] and he was going to bring his word
[1:07:58] amen through a kentuckian with a seventh
[1:08:00] grade education
[1:08:01] who wouldn't even complete a thought
[1:08:03] until he went way around the cowshed
[1:08:07] he would start explaining a scripture
[1:08:09] and stop amen
[1:08:10] and greet people in the audience
[1:08:14] and then come over here and tell this
[1:08:15] story and finally several chapters pages
[1:08:18] paragraphs whatever later he would get
[1:08:20] back around and then he would start to
[1:08:22] explain what he didn't explain or he'd
[1:08:24] halfway explain it then he would finish
[1:08:25] it in another sermon
[1:08:26] or he would lay down a foundation in
[1:08:28] here and come back two months later and
[1:08:30] touch the same point
[1:08:32] why because he's trying to hide it amen
[1:08:35] he's trying to hide it and reveal it at
[1:08:37] the same time
[1:08:40] because he doesn't want a bride who
[1:08:41] chooses him he wants a bride of his own
[1:08:44] choosing
[1:08:44] that's his purpose
[1:08:48] so he put a bride seed in the land to
[1:08:51] come forth at a certain period of time
[1:08:53] he would have a certain word to match
[1:08:55] that seed to quicken it to life
[1:08:57] amen and only that seed and that word
[1:09:00] are the only two things that can link
[1:09:01] together
[1:09:04] you were born in the perfect time in the
[1:09:06] perfect season
[1:09:08] to catch the perfect word amen to come
[1:09:11] to life
[1:09:15] the heart purpose listen friends i'm not
[1:09:17] just talking
[1:09:18] i'm telling you brother brahm said the
[1:09:20] heart purpose of god
[1:09:22] amen everything he's been doing just
[1:09:25] like he did in the days of creation
[1:09:27] everything he was doing was to get his
[1:09:29] son and his son's bride
[1:09:30] together again and in eden that was his
[1:09:33] heart purpose there
[1:09:34] his heart purpose now is to have a bride
[1:09:36] of his own choosing
[1:09:37] amen and not just to say uh lord lord
[1:09:40] that was
[1:09:41] them calling him lord
[1:09:45] and he says depart from me i never knew
[1:09:47] you
[1:09:48] amen but his heart purpose
[1:09:52] the eternal purpose of god was to take a
[1:09:55] bride of his
[1:09:56] own choosing
[1:09:59] if you think you had anything to do with
[1:10:01] this then you need to start over
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:04] you didn't figure anything out you
[1:10:06] weren't smart enough you didn't read
[1:10:08] enough books till you finally come to a
[1:10:09] conclusion
[1:10:10] amen if that's so you chose him and he
[1:10:13] didn't want a bride that chooses him
[1:10:15] he's not looking for a modern day layout
[1:10:17] to see and woman that says i'll choose
[1:10:18] him
[1:10:21] that's not what he wants amen he wants
[1:10:23] somebody to stay humble and submissive
[1:10:25] and he says this is the one i choose
[1:10:30] and his choosing is expressed the same
[1:10:32] ways expressed in abraham
[1:10:34] by faith in the present tense i am god
[1:10:38] the heart purpose the eternal purpose i
[1:10:40] just don't want you ever to forget that
[1:10:42] the heart purpose
[1:10:43] the eternal purpose of god is to take a
[1:10:45] bride of his own choosing
[1:10:46] i want to ask you the question did he
[1:10:48] choose you or did you choose him
[1:10:52] if he chose you
[1:10:55] oh friends i wasn't looking for the
[1:10:58] message
[1:11:00] i was washing my nets
[1:11:03] i was hiding in a pentecostal tree
[1:11:09] he come my way i was just as bad off as
[1:11:13] the samaritan woman
[1:11:14] going to the well
[1:11:18] amen already on the sixth husband
[1:11:25] but he come and he found me because he
[1:11:26] had needs to go by
[1:11:30] because why he wanted a bride of his own
[1:11:32] choosing
[1:11:35] and you know what you and i aren't the
[1:11:38] only people who's heard this message
[1:11:41] who's had an opportunity in life how
[1:11:43] many millions and billions have turned
[1:11:44] away from it
[1:11:46] but yet something in you flickered to
[1:11:49] life
[1:11:50] and you couldn't put it out then nobody
[1:11:53] else could blow it out
[1:11:55] and enough denominational tainted water
[1:11:57] poured on it wouldn't quench it either
[1:11:59] something came to life that wouldn't go
[1:12:00] out because he wanted a bride of his own
[1:12:03] choosing
[1:12:06] and that purpose was in himself
[1:12:09] and being eternal was decreed before the
[1:12:11] foundation
[1:12:12] of the world if god chose you
[1:12:18] i'm going to say this and catch it
[1:12:19] friends if god chose you
[1:12:23] you're his heart purpose
[1:12:27] you're part of his heart purpose
[1:12:32] are you worried about being lost not
[1:12:35] making it
[1:12:36] not being good enough not measuring up
[1:12:39] not oh we got to let all that fade away
[1:12:43] let all that disappear because you
[1:12:45] haven't chosen me i've chosen you
[1:12:47] i gave you the ability to receive i put
[1:12:49] a seed in you before the foundation of
[1:12:51] the world
[1:12:51] i made sure that when the word come
[1:12:53] along there was something and you would
[1:12:54] say that's nothing but the truth and
[1:12:56] when everybody you loved and everybody
[1:12:58] you trusted in religion
[1:12:59] told you you were wrong you still said
[1:13:01] that's the truth
[1:13:05] because his heart's purpose was to have
[1:13:06] a bride of his own choosing
[1:13:09] it wasn't your choice but there goes and
[1:13:12] says watch carefully now
[1:13:14] and see this before there was ever a
[1:13:16] speck of stardust before
[1:13:18] god was god god is an object of
[1:13:20] adoration and no one was there to
[1:13:21] worship him
[1:13:22] so he was at that time only potentially
[1:13:24] god and he was known only as eternal
[1:13:27] spirit the bride was
[1:13:28] already in his mind yes she was she was
[1:13:32] existing in his thoughts
[1:13:36] i was in genesis 1 1 before
[1:13:40] before he found my earth void and
[1:13:42] shrouded in darkness and in judgment
[1:13:44] and in chaos i was eternal existing
[1:13:48] in his thoughts
[1:13:53] genesis chapter 1 is my story amen
[1:13:57] it's not a story it's the story to
[1:14:00] unlock the mystery of my life
[1:14:06] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:14:09] the bride was already in his mind yes
[1:14:11] she was she was existing in his thoughts
[1:14:13] and what about those thoughts of god
[1:14:15] they are eternal
[1:14:17] are they not
[1:14:21] in the sardisian church age he says now
[1:14:24] let us go another step but before we do
[1:14:26] let us review our case thus far
[1:14:28] first of all we know most assuredly that
[1:14:30] the purpose of god
[1:14:31] stands an election it was purposed
[1:14:34] in himself it was god's purpose to bring
[1:14:37] forth a people
[1:14:38] like unto himself that would be a word
[1:14:40] bride
[1:14:44] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:14:46] the world in him she was pre
[1:14:48] she was foreknown and beloved before she
[1:14:50] was ever brought forth during the ages
[1:14:52] upon the earth
[1:14:53] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:14:55] never
[1:14:57] never that's all capitalized in the
[1:14:58] church but he could never
[1:15:00] come into condemnation just like abraham
[1:15:04] could never come into conan you realize
[1:15:07] abraham
[1:15:08] was wrong abraham was lying but he could
[1:15:12] never come into condemnation because of
[1:15:14] faith in god
[1:15:18] amen praise be to god his blood and can
[1:15:22] never come into condemnation she can
[1:15:23] never be in the judgment because sin
[1:15:25] cannot be imputed unto her because she
[1:15:29] has no unbelief in her soul
[1:15:42] i want to read just one sentence out of
[1:15:44] here again
[1:15:46] it was god's purpose to bring forth a
[1:15:48] people
[1:15:49] like unto himself that would be a word
[1:15:53] bride
[1:16:00] if we're trying hard to be the word
[1:16:04] bride
[1:16:08] if we're laboring trying
[1:16:11] straining stretching
[1:16:15] to be a word bride then that totally
[1:16:19] dissolves what brother branham just told
[1:16:20] us
[1:16:22] he said he purposed
[1:16:26] he i'm telling you what's the greatest
[1:16:28] force that's moving
[1:16:30] everything his purpose
[1:16:33] his will god's purpose was based on his
[1:16:36] love
[1:16:38] he purposed to have a people
[1:16:42] like unto himself
[1:16:46] and he is the word that's why he says
[1:16:49] she'll be a word
[1:16:50] bride she's
[1:16:53] not going to have to strain and stretch
[1:16:57] and try to be the word bride
[1:17:02] why because he already purposed
[1:17:05] should be the word bride and because he
[1:17:08] already impurposed that that's the
[1:17:10] manifestation he's looking for this day
[1:17:13] he made sure there was something down
[1:17:15] inside that vessel
[1:17:17] that could respond to a spoken word
[1:17:22] just like in genesis 1 he made sure
[1:17:25] before he said
[1:17:26] let the grasses and the trees bring
[1:17:28] forth he made sure
[1:17:29] before before ever destruction came he
[1:17:32] made sure some seeds got planted
[1:17:35] so that when he spoke there was
[1:17:38] something there that could respond
[1:17:41] and because god determined that he would
[1:17:43] have a word bride in the last days
[1:17:46] unlike any other people that's been on
[1:17:49] the planet friends you realize this
[1:17:50] this is a higher order this is a higher
[1:17:52] calling this is a higher manifestation
[1:17:55] for the bride
[1:17:58] it's not a straining and doing spiritual
[1:18:01] exercises
[1:18:02] and working my way into endurance to
[1:18:04] become a word bride
[1:18:06] no he already purposed you would be the
[1:18:08] word bride
[1:18:09] he already foreordained your position
[1:18:11] your place
[1:18:12] that you would come to be a perfect
[1:18:14] bride by receiving a perfect word amen
[1:18:16] to bring forth the perfect life of jesus
[1:18:18] christ
[1:18:19] in human vessels by what
[1:18:22] by the predestinated purpose of god
[1:18:24] that's laying in your soul
[1:18:26] amen that he unlocked with his spoken
[1:18:28] word and he is watering with the washing
[1:18:30] of the water of the word
[1:18:31] to bring all the potential that's in
[1:18:33] that seed to life
[1:18:35] we don't it's not a straining amen it's
[1:18:38] not a
[1:18:39] pushing it's not a reformation it's not
[1:18:41] a writing down the rules and putting
[1:18:43] them on the refrigerator so we remember
[1:18:45] dress modestly don't use these words and
[1:18:50] you understand it's not that it's a life
[1:18:53] that's already locked inside the seat
[1:18:55] that's been
[1:18:55] unlocked by the light for this hour the
[1:18:57] spoken word in this day
[1:18:59] meeting the i am amen imputing
[1:19:01] righteousness unto you and
[1:19:02] bringing out that life that's already
[1:19:06] there what do we do
[1:19:10] rest brother i said the whole christian
[1:19:14] walk is based on
[1:19:16] rest well how can i rest
[1:19:19] i'm still making mistakes how can i rest
[1:19:21] i still have a temper how can i rest i
[1:19:24] still keep falling into the same hole
[1:19:26] how can i rest you rest because no
[1:19:28] matter how much you strive you're going
[1:19:30] to fall right back in that same hole
[1:19:32] you have to rest and let the word do the
[1:19:34] work
[1:19:35] you have to rest in the fact that god is
[1:19:38] purposed he's called
[1:19:39] he's chosen he's ordained he's called me
[1:19:42] to a certain manifestation in a certain
[1:19:44] day
[1:19:45] and he purposed it and nothing not even
[1:19:47] my own wrong thinking can stop his
[1:19:49] purpose
[1:19:51] nothing not even my past not even my
[1:19:53] failures not even the habits that are
[1:19:54] still in my flesh
[1:19:55] can stop his purpose because it's an
[1:19:58] eternal purpose
[1:19:58] that he purposed in himself and he will
[1:20:00] not fail to bring it forth
[1:20:04] but you've got to stay in the word and
[1:20:06] let the word
[1:20:07] do the work
[1:20:11] the devil has deceived many
[1:20:15] because this try i'm trying
[1:20:21] well then you're choosing him
[1:20:26] i'm trying to believe then you're trying
[1:20:30] to choose him
[1:20:36] the word come to unlock the royal seat
[1:20:39] of abraham
[1:20:42] so that the amnesia can be begin to
[1:20:45] break away
[1:20:47] the cloud that's overshadowing the
[1:20:49] spiritual amnesia
[1:20:51] can begin to disintegrate and the light
[1:20:53] can hit the seed
[1:20:55] because the power of transformation into
[1:20:57] the bride of jesus christ jesus christ
[1:20:59] in brideform is in the city
[1:21:02] and if we'll just stay in the word and
[1:21:05] trust
[1:21:07] that this is his purpose this is his
[1:21:10] plan
[1:21:11] this is his calling this is his heart
[1:21:14] purpose
[1:21:17] all i got to do is have the same faith
[1:21:20] of
[1:21:20] abraham
[1:21:24] abraham could not make himself
[1:21:27] young again no matter how hard he tried
[1:21:31] abraham could not restore his seed no
[1:21:34] matter how he charged
[1:21:35] and neither could abraham turn back
[1:21:37] sarah's womb
[1:21:39] and give her back her time of life it
[1:21:41] was totally out of his hands
[1:21:42] he could do nothing but believe what he
[1:21:45] was told
[1:21:47] and we've been called to the faith of
[1:21:49] abraham i can do nothing about it but
[1:21:51] believe what i've been told
[1:21:53] i can do nothing to be the word by but
[1:21:55] believe what i've been told
[1:21:56] to receive it to accept it to say that's
[1:21:58] thus saith the lord that's nothing but
[1:22:00] the truth
[1:22:00] and i'm part of that and i'm trusting
[1:22:03] him to do the part that i can't do
[1:22:11] praise god let's turn over to romans
[1:22:15] chapter 8.
[1:22:18] we're going to skip through a little bit
[1:22:19] of this and finish here in romans
[1:22:20] chapter 8.
[1:22:23] verse 31
[1:22:28] romans 8 31
[1:22:31] what shall we then say to these things
[1:22:35] if god before us who can be against us
[1:22:43] he that spared not his own son but
[1:22:44] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:22:46] not with him also freely give us
[1:22:49] all things who shall lay anything to the
[1:22:52] charge of god's elect
[1:22:53] it is god that justifieth just
[1:22:56] as if you've never done it in the first
[1:22:59] place
[1:23:01] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:23:04] that died
[1:23:04] yea rather that has risen again who is
[1:23:07] even at the right hand of god who also
[1:23:09] maketh intercession for us
[1:23:11] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:23:12] christ shall tribulation or distress
[1:23:15] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:23:17] peril or sword
[1:23:19] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:23:21] killed all the day long
[1:23:23] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:23:24] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[1:23:27] more than conquerors through him that
[1:23:29] loved us
[1:23:29] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:23:32] nor life nor angels nor
[1:23:34] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:23:35] present nor things to come
[1:23:37] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:23:39] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:23:41] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:23:43] jesus
[1:23:44] our lord and it was his great love and
[1:23:48] compassion to begin to brood over the
[1:23:50] earth and bring it up
[1:23:51] and it's his great love and compassion
[1:23:53] has been brooding over your earth
[1:23:54] to bring up his eden condition again
[1:24:02] what's he asking us to do what do i do
[1:24:04] next
[1:24:05] believe believe
[1:24:09] believe confess believe
[1:24:13] and let the word do the work that it's
[1:24:16] predestinated do let the word
[1:24:18] change us transform us
[1:24:21] make us that word bride let's all stand
[1:24:25] friends
[1:24:26] musicians you can come
[1:24:33] you know god
[1:24:37] knew where moses was when moses ran away
[1:24:43] and god didn't decide to get another
[1:24:45] deliverer or another moses
[1:24:48] because he had already purposed that
[1:24:50] this vessel would be moses
[1:24:53] the seed was already there his portion
[1:24:55] of himself the attribute that would be
[1:24:57] moses was already
[1:24:58] there god couldn't swap it out for
[1:25:00] another
[1:25:01] so when moses gets discouraged and he
[1:25:04] tries in his own efforts and he fails
[1:25:06] and he runs off into the wilderness god
[1:25:08] never lost track of that seed
[1:25:11] and he never kicked him away and he
[1:25:13] never changed his eternal purpose for
[1:25:15] moses
[1:25:18] but in due season when moses had learned
[1:25:20] some things
[1:25:21] when there was lessons that were learned
[1:25:23] when humility had come when moses no
[1:25:25] longer thought that he could do anything
[1:25:27] he come to moses and and now
[1:25:30] he found moses and told moses now you go
[1:25:34] right back and do what i always purpose
[1:25:36] for you to do
[1:25:38] not in your strength and not your way
[1:25:40] but now you're going to do it my way
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:45] see god knew where moses was he wasn't
[1:25:47] going to get another moses
[1:25:50] when jonah got the commission and what
[1:25:52] he heard seemed too
[1:25:53] complicated too difficult too hard more
[1:25:55] than he wanted to give
[1:25:58] jonah ran away and got on the ship to go
[1:26:00] the opposite way and god didn't say well
[1:26:02] if he's going to act that way i'll get
[1:26:03] somebody else to do my work
[1:26:08] but even jonah's heir was playing right
[1:26:10] into god's hand because he had already
[1:26:12] prepared a fish
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] he knew jonah's weakness he knew jonah's
[1:26:18] fair but he also knew how to get the
[1:26:19] nineveh because they worshipped the fish
[1:26:21] god
[1:26:24] so he runs away and he says oh how can
[1:26:27] he how can he do that
[1:26:28] god that's god's predestinated seed
[1:26:33] so he swallows him up in a fish and he
[1:26:35] swims him right back and spits him out
[1:26:36] on dry land
[1:26:37] and he preaches the gospel and they're
[1:26:39] converted or they repent
[1:26:42] see god it doesn't matter how many times
[1:26:45] you've failed
[1:26:46] how many times you've run away how many
[1:26:48] times you backslid
[1:26:49] he's not going to replace you with
[1:26:50] another predestination he can't
[1:26:53] he purposed within himself he's already
[1:26:56] determined it's already purposed it's
[1:26:57] already written in the book
[1:26:59] he's not going to cast you away and get
[1:27:00] another one he's not going to just let
[1:27:02] you go
[1:27:02] but at some point you're going to
[1:27:04] encounter the pillar of fire that's
[1:27:06] going to put you right
[1:27:06] back in the commission that he
[1:27:08] originally called you he's going to
[1:27:10] catch you
[1:27:11] in the whale of the belly of a whale and
[1:27:13] spit you on dry land so you're going to
[1:27:15] finish the work that he purposed for you
[1:27:17] to finish
[1:27:17] you're going to get there one way or the
[1:27:19] other but you're going to get there
[1:27:21] you're going to fulfill his purpose for
[1:27:23] your life you're going to do what he's
[1:27:24] called you to do
[1:27:25] you're going to do what was in his mind
[1:27:26] from before the foundation of the world
[1:27:28] whether it's easy whether it's hard
[1:27:30] amen you're going to do it anyways
[1:27:36] elijah got tired a lot of spiritual
[1:27:40] battles
[1:27:42] fighting that jezebel spirit showdown on
[1:27:45] mount carmel
[1:27:46] she threatens to kill him he runs away
[1:27:48] tired overworked
[1:27:50] stressed and then lays down under a
[1:27:52] juniper tree and prays that god will
[1:27:54] take his life
[1:27:58] god didn't reject him god didn't cast
[1:28:01] him away
[1:28:02] god didn't even scold him
[1:28:06] god sent the angels one of the angels
[1:28:08] with the softest hands
[1:28:13] why because he had a purpose for elijah
[1:28:16] elijah took a stand for him and elijah
[1:28:18] took a lot of scars
[1:28:20] he comes down he sends the angel with
[1:28:22] the softest hands
[1:28:24] stroke his face it prepared angel food
[1:28:28] and fed him brother ram said then he had
[1:28:31] an angel choir with the sweetest voices
[1:28:33] sweeter than any mother could sing a
[1:28:34] lullaby
[1:28:36] sing him back to sleep to let him rest
[1:28:38] then wake him up and feed him said
[1:28:40] you'll need the strength of this journey
[1:28:41] and he goes to horeb
[1:28:42] amen he goes to horeb and he goes into a
[1:28:44] cave
[1:28:47] and he's running away and he's hiding
[1:28:49] out
[1:28:51] and god allows a great fire
[1:28:54] to come across but god wasn't in the
[1:28:56] fire
[1:28:57] a great whirlwind but god wasn't in the
[1:28:59] whirlwind an earthquake but god wasn't
[1:29:01] in the earthquake but then a still small
[1:29:03] voice and god was in the still small
[1:29:05] voice
[1:29:07] brother ben said that still small voice
[1:29:09] was the word of god
[1:29:12] not without show not with showmanship
[1:29:14] not with earthquake
[1:29:16] not with fire not with great but just
[1:29:18] the common word of god
[1:29:22] god wasn't in the fire and the
[1:29:24] earthquake and he wasn't but he was in
[1:29:26] this word his spoken word
[1:29:28] the still small voice and there was
[1:29:31] something
[1:29:31] in elijah no matter how tired he was and
[1:29:33] how much he wanted to die and how much
[1:29:35] he was finished
[1:29:36] amen with his commission and with his
[1:29:37] work amen the still small voice got his
[1:29:40] attention
[1:29:41] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if
[1:29:43] you backslid if you run away if you got
[1:29:45] discouraged if you got tired of church
[1:29:47] blitz you got tired of fights and you
[1:29:48] got tired of your own failure
[1:29:50] and you ran away he can get your
[1:29:53] attention
[1:29:54] with the word and he asked elijah
[1:29:59] elijah what does thou do is dear
[1:30:03] he said well i've been zealous for your
[1:30:05] word i've done this
[1:30:06] and this has happened and they seek my
[1:30:08] life he goes through the whole
[1:30:09] explanation he says
[1:30:11] what doest out here he goes through the
[1:30:13] whole explanation again
