[0:00] Oh, I love him better every day.
[0:06] I love him better every day.
[0:11] Close by his side. I will abide. Oh, I
[0:17] love him better every day.
[0:21] And I love him better every day.
[0:26] Oh, I love him better every day
[0:32] and close by his side. I will abide.
[0:37] I love him better every day.
[0:42] And soon this life will all be over.
[0:48] And our pilgrimage will end.
[0:53] And we'll take our heavenly journey
[0:58] and be at home with Christ our friend.
[1:03] And heaven's gates are standing open,
[1:09] waiting for our entrance there.
[1:14] They were going over.
[1:19] All the beauty there to share.
[1:23] Oh, just a little while to stay.
[1:29] Oh, just a little while to wait.
[1:34] And just a little while to lay
[1:39] in that path that's always straight.
[1:44] And just a little more of trouble
[1:49] in this low and simple state.
[1:54] And then we'll enter heaven's portal,
[1:59] sweeping through the pearly gate.
[2:04] Soon we'll meet all the redeemed
[2:08] ones, and we'll take them by the hand.
[2:13] And
[2:14] soon we rise into our bosom
[2:19] over in the promised land.
[2:24] Then we'll be at home forever
[2:29] throughout all eternity.
[2:34] Oh, what a blessed blessing.
[2:40] That eternal morning will be.
[2:44] Oh, just a little while to stay here.
[2:50] Just a little while to wait.
[2:54] Just a little while to
[3:00] in that path that's always straight.
[3:04] Just a little more of trouble
[3:09] in this low and simple state
[3:14] and we'll enter heaven's portal.
[3:19] Oh, sweeping through those early gates.
[3:24] God is good
[3:27] all the time.
[3:30] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[3:35] mine. God is good
[3:39] all the time.
[3:42] And through the darkest night, his light
[3:46] will shine. God is good.
[3:50] Oh, God is good
[3:53] all the time.
[3:56] If you're walking
[3:59] through a valley
[4:01] and there are shadows
[4:04] all around,
[4:07] do not fear.
[4:10] He will guide you. He will keep you safe
[4:16] and sound.
[4:18] He has promised
[4:21] never leave you
[4:24] or forsake you.
[4:27] And his word is true. God is good
[4:32] all the time.
[4:35] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[4:40] mine. God is good
[4:44] all the time.
[4:46] Through the darkest night in light will
[4:51] shine. God is good.
[4:54] Oh, God is good.
[4:57] Oh, all the time
[5:00] we are sinners,
[5:03] so unworthy.
[5:05] And yet for us he chose to die.
[5:11] Fill us with his
[5:14] holy spirit.
[5:16] Now we can stand and testify.
[5:22] Oh that his love
[5:25] it's everlasting
[5:28] and his mercy
[5:31] they will never end. And God is good
[5:36] all the time.
[5:39] Put a song of praise in this heart of
[5:43] mine. God is good
[5:47] all the time.
[5:50] Through the darkest night, his light
[5:54] will shine. God is good.
[5:58] Oh, God is good
[6:00] all the time. God. Though I may not
[6:06] understand
[6:09] all the plans you have for me.
[6:15] My life is in your hands.
[6:20] And through the eyes of faith, I can
[6:24] clearly see
[6:27] God is good
[6:30] all the time.
[6:33] Put a song of praise in this heart of
[6:37] mine. God is good
[6:41] all the time.
[6:45] Darkest night, his light will shine. God
[6:50] is good.
[6:52] Oh, God is good. God is good. God is
[6:55] good.
[6:57] Oh, God is good. Once more, God is good.
[7:03] Oh, God is good
[7:06] all the time.
[7:09] Amen. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[7:15] true.
[7:17] Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[7:22] true.
[7:24] For there's a race that I must run, and
[7:28] there's victories to be won. Give me
[7:32] power every hour to be true.
[7:37] Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[7:42] true.
[7:44] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true.
[7:51] For there's a race that I must run.
[7:54] There are victories to be won. Give me
[7:58] power every hour to be true.
[8:04] and seek ye first the kingom
[8:09] of God,
[8:12] and his rightuousness,
[8:19] and all these things shall be added unto
[8:24] you.
[8:26] Oh hallelu
[8:29] hallelu.
[8:34] And man shall not live
[8:37] by bread alone
[8:41] but by every
[8:45] word
[8:49] that proceeds from the mouth of God.
[8:56] Oh hallelujah
[8:59] hallelu.
[9:03] So ask and it shall be given unto you.
[9:10] Seek and ye shall find.
[9:18] Knock and the door will be opened unto
[9:23] you.
[9:25] Oh hallelujah.
[9:28] Hallelujah.
[9:32] Oh, see ye first
[9:37] of God
[9:40] and his rightuousness
[9:47] and all these things shall be added unto
[9:53] you.
[9:55] Oh hallelujah.
[9:58] Hallelujah.
[10:03] in my
[10:06] life.
[10:08] Lord
[10:10] be glorified.
[10:13] Be glorified
[10:17] in
[10:19] my
[10:21] night.
[10:23] Lord
[10:25] be glorified
[10:28] today.
[10:31] Oh,
[10:34] your
[10:35] ground
[10:37] Lord
[10:39] be glorified.
[10:43] Be glorified
[10:46] in
[10:48] your
[10:50] bride.
[10:52] Lord
[10:54] be glorified
[10:57] today in my heart. Oh, in
[11:02] my
[11:04] heart,
[11:06] Lord
[11:08] be glorified.
[11:12] Be glorified
[11:15] in
[11:17] my
[11:19] heart. Oh Lord,
[11:22] be glorified
[11:26] today.
[11:29] Amen.
[11:31] And God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[11:33] together.
[11:34] Lord Jesus, once again, we're so
[11:37] grateful to be here, Lord. God, we know
[11:40] you've drawn us together again for we
[11:43] can do nothing without you, Lord. We
[11:46] just want to say, Lord, as we're
[11:47] gathered together, it's a privilege to
[11:49] be able to lift our voices and sing your
[11:51] praises. Now, to turn our hearts to your
[11:54] word, Lord, to read the word is a
[11:56] privilege. God, we pray that you'd come
[12:00] by your spirit, the anointing of your
[12:02] spirit. Would you open our understanding
[12:04] to understand your word? Would you feed
[12:06] us yourself by your own hand upon this
[12:09] precious word? And God, may you receive
[12:11] our worship and our praises, Lord. And
[12:13] may you take preeminence among us now.
[12:16] May your word find a place, a permanent
[12:18] dwelling place in each of us. And may be
[12:21] a more than just a storehouse for your
[12:23] word, but a place where that word will
[12:24] grow and manifest and be a light in this
[12:27] world. Help us each one come to that,
[12:30] Lord, more and more as the day
[12:32] approaches. We love you. We ask your
[12:34] blessing over all is said and done. Use
[12:37] me for your glory as I surrender to your
[12:39] hand. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[12:43] Amen.
[12:44] Amen. God bless you. Amen. While we're
[12:47] standing, if you want to take your
[12:48] Bibles and turn with me to John chapter
[12:50] 6, we'll begin there. Amen. God bless
[12:53] you, Brother Howard. It's good to have
[12:54] you here. Amen. Anybody else who's
[12:56] visiting, we just want to say God bless
[12:58] you. And you're very welcome. Amen.
[13:02] Amen. John chapter 6
[13:06] and verse 52. John chapter 6 verse 52.
[13:13] And we're yeah we're going to read uh
[13:15] from verse 52. The Jews therefore strove
[13:18] among themselves saying, "How can this
[13:20] man give us his flesh to eat?" Then
[13:22] Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I
[13:24] say unto you, except you eat the flesh
[13:27] of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
[13:29] you have no life in you. Who so eateth
[13:32] my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath
[13:34] eternal life and I will raise him up at
[13:36] the last day. For my flesh is meat
[13:38] indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
[13:42] Now, let's skip down to uh verse 60.
[13:47] Many therefore of his disciples when
[13:49] they heard this said, "This is a hard
[13:51] saying. Who can hear it?" Then Jesus
[13:54] knew in himself that his disciples
[13:56] murmured at it. He said unto them, "Does
[13:58] this offend you? what and if you shall
[14:00] see the Son of Man ascend up where he
[14:03] was before. Let's go now to verse 66.
[14:09] From that time many of his disciples
[14:11] went back and walked no more with him.
[14:13] Then said Jesus unto the twel, "Will you
[14:16] also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered
[14:19] him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou
[14:22] hast the words of eternal life, and we
[14:25] believe and are sure that thou art the
[14:27] Christ, the son of the living God. Amen.
[14:30] God bless you as you have your seats.
[14:33] May the Lord bless us as we look at his
[14:35] word and may he grant us revelation of
[14:38] his word.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could go ahead and bring the
[14:41] PowerPoint up this evening, I'm going to
[14:44] minister on our discernment. Our
[14:46] discernment. And uh when I was preparing
[14:50] for this, I prepared for it and I got
[14:52] done and I thought, my I think I've
[14:54] preached some of this before and I got
[14:56] nervous. I'm like, I can't if I did this
[14:58] like last week, I'm going to be so
[14:59] nervous. But I preached on discernment.
[15:01] I preached two parts almost 5 years ago.
[15:05] And so I don't think I remember
[15:07] everything that was said. So we're going
[15:08] to touch on it again, but this might be
[15:10] a little bit different than that. But I
[15:11] want to preach on our discernment. And
[15:13] I'm taking that from a quote, and we're
[15:14] going to get to that quote in just a
[15:16] minute. But here we find in John chapter
[15:18] 6 as Jesus was beginning to lay out the
[15:22] word but he was doing it in such a
[15:24] unique way. He was laying out the word
[15:26] in typology. He was giving out the
[15:28] truth. Amen. That would require a
[15:30] revelation to understand. It would
[15:32] require something more than
[15:34] intellectualism because he was saying
[15:36] something that didn't intellectually
[15:38] make any sense. I mean it made sense.
[15:40] Like we understand eat and we understand
[15:42] blood and we understand drink. I mean we
[15:44] understand body. We understand all those
[15:46] words. Intellectually, the words made
[15:48] sense. But spiritually they could not
[15:50] compute. They did not understand what he
[15:52] was trying to say. It sounded completely
[15:54] wrong to everything that they knew.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; And he was speaking absolute truth in a
[15:59] way that sounded completely wrong.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz Moses had told them, Amen, what they
[16:05] were allowed to eat and what they were
[16:07] not allowed to eat. And guess what?
[16:08] Human flesh never showed up anywhere on
[16:10] the list of pros or the list of cons.
[16:12] Yeah.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; And the law of Moses forbid the drinking
[16:15] of blood of anything. Amen. But the
[16:18] pouring of it out because the life was
[16:19] in the blood. So everything that he was
[16:21] saying sounded absolutely so completely
[16:24] wrong. Amen. And he was so completely
[16:26] right. But he wasn't speaking to them on
[16:28] an intellectual basis. He was speaking
[16:31] to the soul. Amen. So those who could
[16:33] catch it on a faith basis.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So then, you know, when he found
[16:38] out that that was hard and they were
[16:39] murmuring and troubled at that, he said,
[16:41] "Well, well, if that's hard,
[16:44] &gt;&gt; does that offend you?
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Why are you offended at that?" Listen,
[16:48] he just told him to eat his flesh and
[16:50] drink his blood. And when they stumbled
[16:52] at the saying and were, he says, "Why
[16:55] are you offended?
[16:57] &gt;&gt; What What did I say that was wrong?"
[17:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Does that offend you?" Well,
[17:03] what if you shall see the son of man
[17:05] ascend up where he was before? Now he's
[17:07] saying, "What if you see me go back to
[17:09] heaven where I came from and all of a
[17:11] sudden everything the short circuiting
[17:13] in the brain?" Cuz the brain can't
[17:15] compute this kind of language. It takes
[17:17] something else, something deeper. So
[17:20] then, you know, they begin to walk away
[17:21] and he turns to the disciples and he
[17:23] says, "Now what about you? Are you going
[17:25] to go?" Amen. And Peter didn't have any
[17:28] more intellectual understanding or idea
[17:31] of what brother Brennham meant than
[17:32] those who were murmuring and complaining
[17:34] and walking away. But what Peter had was
[17:37] something else lodged down in his soul.
[17:39] And it was a receptor for the word of
[17:41] God. And even though his brain could not
[17:43] pick it up, could not compute, could not
[17:46] spit out the formula or the equation or
[17:48] the conclusion, SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE
[17:50] SAYS, "BUT WHERE ELSE ARE WE GOING TO
[17:52] GO? For you alone have the WORDS OF
[17:55] ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU
[17:57] SAY IS RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
[17:59] MEAN, BUT IT'S RIGHT.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that you are
[18:07] the Christ, the son of the living God.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm so thankful for something
[18:14] deeper than the brain.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:19] So, when I looked up the word
[18:21] discernment in the Oxford dictionary,
[18:24] and I have no idea if Oxford's good or
[18:26] not. I'm just going to tell you what the
[18:27] dictionary said. Discernment means the
[18:29] ability to judge well. The ability to
[18:33] judge well. And the word discern means
[18:37] to perceive or recognize as in
[18:40] something. To perceive or recognize uh
[18:43] that that something's true or to
[18:45] perceive or recognize what it is. And so
[18:48] discern is the basis for discernment. So
[18:51] it takes a perception or a recognition
[18:54] of something in order to properly judge
[18:57] it.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; So discernment is the ability to judge
[19:01] well. But in order to have discernment,
[19:04] you have to be able to discern. You have
[19:05] to be able to perceive something or or
[19:08] recognize something and able to properly
[19:11] judge it.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page?
[19:14] &gt;&gt; All right. I hope now this is the quote
[19:18] that began my my my musing and my
[19:21] meditation. Brother says, "Now our
[19:24] eternal destination is not altogether
[19:27] determined by what we see and what we
[19:29] hear, but it is determined on what
[19:31] discernment we have of what we see and
[19:34] what we hear."
[19:37] &gt;&gt; That's Oh, that's good. You know what
[19:39] I'm getting ready to do? I'm getting
[19:40] ready to underline it. Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; It's determined on what discernment we
[19:45] have.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, how many people have
[19:50] heard the message, heard the prophet's
[19:51] ministry, heard the truth coming forth.
[19:53] Amen. But for some, it was an odd
[19:55] saying. It was hard to hard to receive.
[19:58] It didn't make any sense what he said.
[20:00] But for somebody else, they said, "It's
[20:02] the truth."
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would to come, if you would
[20:06] to come to Peter, Amen. And Peter makes
[20:08] this declaration. Amen. Where else shall
[20:09] we go? For thou alone have the words of
[20:11] eternal life. We know that whatever you
[20:13] say is basically he's saying you've got
[20:16] the truth. What you said is right. This
[20:18] is correct. Amen. Can you imagine those
[20:20] who walked away going to Peter later and
[20:21] said, "Peter, I heard what you said."
[20:23] Amen. Could you explain it to me maybe
[20:25] in a better way so that I'll understand?
[20:27] And Peter says, "I don't even
[20:29] understand. I can't explain it to you."
[20:31] Amen. I just take what he said and what
[20:33] he said is the truth.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH?
[20:38] &gt;&gt; YEAH. HOW CAN YOU PROVE IT'S THE TRUTH?
[20:41] HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE UP AN
[20:43] EQUATION OR A COMPILATION AND SPIT OUT
[20:45] THE CORRECT? HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
[20:47] IT'S THE TRUTH? And Peter would sit
[20:49] THERE AND SAY, "I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW
[20:51] IT'S THE TRUTH."
[20:53] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because he HEARD AND SAW the same
[20:56] thing they heard and saw, but their
[20:58] discernment of what they heard and saw
[21:00] was different than Peter's discernment
[21:02] of what he heard and saw.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I want to have true
[21:08] discernment.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; And this he says, "Let me straighten a
[21:14] little scripture here for you." I think
[21:16] we're off the phone, but we're still
[21:17] here. St. John 5:24 said, "He that
[21:20] hearth my word and believeth on him that
[21:22] sent me has everlasting life." Now look,
[21:24] I go down the street and just take that
[21:26] literally what it is without the
[21:28] spiritual understanding. Not making it
[21:30] say nothing else, but just saying what
[21:32] it says. the right word there in the
[21:34] Greek. In the original, it says, "He
[21:36] that understandeth my word." Now, to
[21:38] prove that's right, I go down there and
[21:40] here's a drunk coming along the street
[21:42] and with some other man's wife on his
[21:43] arm and cussing and taking God's name in
[21:45] vain and everything else like that. Say,
[21:47] "Did you hear what that preacher said?
[21:49] Did you?" Yeah, I heard it. That don't
[21:52] mean he's got eternal life. See, he that
[21:55] understandeth my word, he that is an
[21:58] eagle.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Oh, so in order to
[22:03] understand the word, you got to be an
[22:04] eagle.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam, I want more scripture
[22:08] than that. All right. My sheep, who's my
[22:11] sheep?
[22:12] &gt;&gt; The eagles.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. A stranger they
[22:19] won't follow.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, it doesn't mean Amen. It doesn't
[22:26] mean you have to understand everything
[22:27] they're saying, but you understand that
[22:29] that's the right voice
[22:31] &gt;&gt; and what he says is true and that it's
[22:34] correct. I may not I may not be able to
[22:36] figure it all out. I may stand just as
[22:39] puzzled as Peter was that day, but one
[22:41] thing I know for sure that this is this
[22:44] is the return of the perfect word with
[22:46] divine vindication. And it was
[22:48] sanctioned by God and vindicated by God
[22:50] and proved to be right by God. And it's
[22:52] true and it's right and it's correct.
[22:54] Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the voice of God. So my
[22:58] sheep hear my voice. What is his voice?
[23:03] &gt;&gt; It is the word.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; And a stranger that won't follow. What's
[23:10] a stranger? Anything that's not the
[23:12] word.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; A amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; I love the word.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; I love this message. I love the word. I
[23:21] love the truth. And and I thank God for
[23:24] his divine grace.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That
[23:31] uh Peter, ignorant and unlearned,
[23:34] &gt;&gt; knew it was true.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; He had discernment. Discernment doesn't
[23:39] come intellectually. Discernment comes
[23:41] by the word. Discernment comes, amen, by
[23:44] the spirit of God. Discernment comes to
[23:46] those who can receive it. And I'm so
[23:48] thankful for that. Amen.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; In John chapter 10, he says, "My father
[23:52] which gave them me is greater than all,
[23:54] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[23:56] my father's hand. I and my father are
[23:58] one." Then the Jews took up stones again
[24:00] to stone him. Jesus answered them, "Many
[24:04] good works have I showed you from my
[24:05] father. For which of these works do you
[24:07] stone me?" The Jews answered him,
[24:09] saying, "For a good work we stone thee
[24:11] not, but for blasphemy, and because that
[24:13] thou being a man makest thyself God."
[24:18] They heard him,
[24:21] &gt;&gt; but their discernment told them he was
[24:23] blaspheing.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't blasphemy. It was the
[24:27] truth.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; What he said was exactly correct. But
[24:30] their discernment of what he said was
[24:33] that this man is blaspheing because
[24:35] there's no way him being a man, amen,
[24:37] could be equal to God. Amen. And it
[24:40] could be God. And he was exactly saying
[24:42] the truth of the word. And they were
[24:44] calling the truth of the word blasphemy
[24:46] because they had no discernment.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God.
[24:52] Now we go to the woman at the well. He
[24:54] comes to the Samaritan woman at the
[24:56] well. Amen. One who's lived a bad life.
[24:59] And the woman saith unto him, I know
[25:00] that Messiah's cometh. This is the end
[25:02] of their conversation. Which is called
[25:04] Christ. When he has come, he will tell
[25:06] us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I
[25:09] that speak unto thee am he. And upon
[25:12] this uh and upon this came his disciples
[25:15] and marveled that he talked with the
[25:16] woman. Yet no man said, "What seekest
[25:18] thou? Or why talkst with her?" The woman
[25:21] then left her water pot and went her way
[25:23] into the city and saith to the men,
[25:25] "Come see a man which told me all things
[25:27] that I ever did. Is not this the
[25:30] Christ?"
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Her discernment of what she heard
[25:34] was much different than the discernment
[25:36] of the Pharisees.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. She she saw a man who began to to
[25:41] begin to say strange things to her that
[25:43] she didn't understand about water and
[25:45] water of eternal life and drinking water
[25:47] and her becoming a well and all of these
[25:49] things she didn't understand. But then
[25:51] the man began to discern her life. Amen.
[25:53] When he discerned her life, she
[25:54] perceived him to be a prophet. THAT
[25:57] MEANS SHE discerned
[25:59] &gt;&gt; that this was a prophet.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SHE COME IN CONTACT WITH A
[26:02] PROPHET, SHE SAID, "OH, I'VE HAD A
[26:05] QUESTION FOR SO LONG. I WANT TO WORSHIP
[26:07] GOD, BUT THE FATHER SAY HERE AND THE
[26:09] JEWS say there. And he gives her an
[26:11] answer. And when HE GIVES THE ANSWER,
[26:13] SHE SAYS, YOU KNOW, MESSIAH is going to
[26:16] come.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CALLED CHRIST. WHEN HE COMES,
[26:20] he's going TO TELL US ALL THINGS. And
[26:22] Jesus says, I that speak to you am he.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing in her SAYS BLASPHEMY.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; NOTHING IN HER SAYS YOU'RE WRONG. AND
[26:31] LISTEN, HOW CAN SHE PROVE IT?
[26:34] WHAT WHAT COMPULATION DID SHE COME UP
[26:36] WITH? WHAT WAS THE FORMULA? HOW COULD
[26:38] SHE SPIT OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER? WHAT WAS
[26:40] THE EVIDENCE SHE HAD? SHE WAS ABLE TO
[26:42] DISCERN THAT THIS WAS A PROPHET. HER
[26:44] DISCERN HER DISCERNING HIM A PROPHET.
[26:47] AMEN. BROUGHT OUT ME M MESSIANIC
[26:49] CHARACTERISTICS AND SHE HAD DISCERNMENT.
[26:52] NOW SHE COULD ACCURATELY JUDGE THAT WHAT
[26:55] HE TOLD ME IS ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH AND
[26:57] HE IS THE CHRIST. SO MUCH SO SHE DROPPED
[27:00] HER WATER POT, RAN INTO THE CITY, and
[27:02] began to declare, "COME SEE A MAN."
[27:04] AMEN. SHE HAD HAD THE TRUTH FOR WHAT, 30
[27:06] SECONDS? 5 MINUTES. AMEN. SHE DIDN'T
[27:08] HAVE TIME TO TEST IT, TO PROVE IT. AMEN.
[27:10] SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GO CHECK IT WITH
[27:12] ANYTHING ELSE. SHE HAD SOMETHING INSIDE
[27:14] OF HER THAT COULD DISCERN that this man
[27:17] was a special MAN. AND HER DISCERNMENT
[27:19] COULD JUDGE THAT WHAT HE SAID TO ME IS
[27:21] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. AND SHE COULD RUN
[27:23] OFF INTO THE CITY AND DECLARE EXACTLY
[27:26] THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE TOLD HER. The
[27:28] Pharisees COULDN'T DO THIS. HE SAID,
[27:30] "THE FATHER AND I ARE ONE." AND THEY
[27:31] PICKED UP A ROCK AND WANTED TO CHUCK IT
[27:33] AT HIM AND KILL HIM BECAUSE THERE'S NO
[27:35] WAY THAT YOU BEING a man could be equal
[27:37] with God.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; So your eternal destination doesn't
[27:44] altogether rest on what you see and
[27:45] hear,
[27:47] &gt;&gt; but on what you your discernment
[27:50] &gt;&gt; of what you see and what you hear. Amen.
[27:52] That's right.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful to God that he's
[27:55] given us something to discern with.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 16,
[28:01] he says, "This is very, very familiar to
[28:03] us, but I'm going to go through it
[28:04] again. When Jesus came into the coast of
[28:07] Cesariah Philippi, he asked his
[28:08] disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that
[28:11] I, the son of man, am?" And they said,
[28:13] "Some say thou art John the Baptist,
[28:16] some Elias, others Jeremiah, and one of
[28:18] the or one of the prophets." He saith
[28:21] unto them, "But whom say that ye that I
[28:23] am?"
[28:24] &gt;&gt; That's the question. I always say that
[28:26] every time. That's the question. That's
[28:27] still the question.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[28:31] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[28:34] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[28:36] him, "Blessed art thou art thou, Simon
[28:38] Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not
[28:41] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[28:43] which is in heaven. and I say also unto
[28:46] thee that thou art Peter, and upon this
[28:48] rock I'll build my church, and the gates
[28:50] of hell shall not prevail against it.
[28:53] He had discernment. He had a revelation
[28:57] that came from the father.
[29:00] And that revelation, amen, wasn't just
[29:03] an intellectual revelation, but it was a
[29:05] divine revelation from the father of who
[29:09] Jesus Christ was, the word for that day.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] And Jesus declares that upon this rock,
[29:16] what rock? The rock of revelation.
[29:18] Revelation of what? Revelation of
[29:20] present tense truth, of present tense
[29:22] light, of present tense Christ.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And upon this rock, I'll build my
[29:28] church. And if the church is built on
[29:30] that rock, the revelation of who Jesus
[29:33] Christ is, present tense,
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Then the gates of hell shall not prevail
[29:38] against it.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're built on anything other
[29:42] than this revelation, Amen. the church
[29:44] will be on sinking sands.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; So, here's what the prophet says about
[29:50] this.
[29:51] The only way you'd ever do it would be
[29:53] for it to personally to be revealed to
[29:57] you. And do you know that's the only way
[29:59] that God built his church? Look, in the
[30:01] Garden of Eden, how did Abel know that
[30:03] it was a blood instead of an apple?
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, see, it was spiritually revealed.
[30:08] And look, when Jesus was here on earth,
[30:10] he said that great notable time that he
[30:12] was speaking, "Who does men say that I,
[30:14] the son of man, am some of them
[30:16] said,"Well, you're Moses or you're
[30:18] Jeremiah or one of the prophets?" He
[30:20] said, "But I'm coming straight to the
[30:21] point. What do you think about it?"
[30:24] &gt;&gt; See, not what somebody else is saying
[30:26] now, but I want to know what you think
[30:28] about it. And that's when Peter spoke up
[30:30] and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[30:32] of the living God."
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. There's a, you know, for
[30:37] us,
[30:39] for us who associate with the message
[30:41] and the circles that we circle with,
[30:43] listen, it's not hard to make a bold
[30:45] declaration that I believe, amen, that
[30:47] that we've had a prophet in our age. And
[30:49] I believe that that prophet restored the
[30:50] word. And that word is my bridegroom.
[30:52] The revealed word of the hour is Jesus
[30:54] Christ revealing himself to me and
[30:56] uniting with me. and as my bridegroom
[30:58] and now I've received the fullness of
[30:59] the word which is him.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Returning to this bride and to be
[31:04] manifest in bride form. AMEN. YOU
[31:06] LISTEN, THAT'S THAT'S AMONGST US. THAT'S
[31:08] NO BOLD DECLARATION. AMEN. We can get
[31:10] that. Amen. We've been taught that all
[31:12] of our lives. Not me, but if you've been
[31:13] raised in the message, YOU'RE TAUGHT IT.
[31:15] AMEN. THAT COULD BE THAT COULD be an
[31:17] intellectual exercise, but it's got to
[31:19] be more than an intellectual exercise.
[31:21] Amen. HE'S NOT ASKING, "WHO DOES THE
[31:24] CHURCH SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID YOUR
[31:25] PASTOR SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID YOUR
[31:27] PARENTS SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID THIS
[31:29] BROTHER THAT YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR OR
[31:30] this sister YOU LOOK UP TO? THE QUESTION
[31:32] ISN'T WHO DOES ANYBODY ELSE SAY THAT HE
[31:34] IS. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR
[31:36] DISCERNMENT OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD?
[31:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOUR DISCERNMENT OF THIS
[31:40] MESSAGE? AMEN. THE DISCERNMENT, AMEN, IS
[31:42] THE THING THAT BRINGS TO US ETERNAL
[31:44] LIFE. AMEN. NOT WHAT WE'VE HEARD OR SEEN
[31:47] OR BEEN TOLD IS TRUE OR NOT TRUE. AMEN.
[31:49] THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT IS EVERYBODY
[31:51] ELSE SAYING. THE QUESTION IS, WHO DO YOU
[31:54] SAY THIS IS?
[31:56] &gt;&gt; And if you IF YOU SAY, "WHO DO YOU SAY
[31:58] THIS IS?" AND YOUR ANSWER IS A PROPHET
[32:00] IN MALACHI 4, YOU HAVEN'T WENT FAR
[32:02] ENOUGH BECAUSE THAT WAS THE INTRODUCTION
[32:04] TO WHO THIS IS. THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN
[32:07] JESUS CHRIST, THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD,
[32:09] COMING BACK INTO MANIFESTATION, ARE THEY
[32:11] TO BE PRESENTED TO A BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST
[32:14] PRESENTING HIMSELF TO ME TO MARRY ME, TO
[32:17] UNITE WITH ME, TO COME INTO ME, AND TO
[32:19] live through me. AMEN.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY DISCERNMENT OF this message.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YOU CAN'T TAKE MY DISCERNMENT
[32:27] AND MAKE IT YOUR DISCERNMENT.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SAY, "WELL, THAT BROTHER, I I
[32:33] see his life and I see he uses scripture
[32:35] and he seems to know what he's talking
[32:37] about. I I think he's right."
[32:41] &gt;&gt; It won't work, friends.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal individual
[32:45] revelation to you and that you know it's
[32:48] true.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:50] Not because you've got the manual.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to explain it all.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; But something in you says,
[32:58] &gt;&gt; "There's no place else to go."
[33:01] &gt;&gt; There's nothing ELSE THAT HAS LIGHT.
[33:02] THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE THAT HAS TRUTH.
[33:04] THIS IS IT.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Just as much as Peter. Amen. Peter was
[33:10] speaking the truth without mental
[33:13] understanding, but he knew it was right.
[33:16] Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; So the question is what is our
[33:19] discernment?
[33:21] Your discernment
[33:23] &gt;&gt; of this message. It's an important
[33:26] question because eternal life is resting
[33:28] upon that discernment.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; It it's not going to the right church.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; It's not sitting under the right
[33:38] ministry.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; I said many times all of us want to go
[33:41] to the right church. I mean, I don't
[33:43] necessarily want to go to a church
[33:45] that's off the word, and I don't want to
[33:46] sit under a ministry that doesn't
[33:47] believe the word, but listen, that's not
[33:49] enough,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; It's got to be an individual, personal
[33:53] revelation from the father.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Says, now faith is a revelation from
[34:00] God. Faith is a revelation. There's
[34:03] where I want to stay there just a
[34:05] moment. It's a revelation. He has
[34:07] revealed it to you by his grace. It's
[34:10] nothing you did. I want you to catch
[34:12] this. He has revealed it to you by your
[34:14] grace. It's nothing you did. You didn't
[34:16] work yourself up to faith.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; It's not a straining and a groaning and
[34:23] a trying to believe.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of straining and groaning
[34:28] and trying in this life.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; And there's not a lot of wrestling with
[34:32] ourselves to manifest the word and bring
[34:34] this body into subjection. There's a lot
[34:36] of wrestling. There's a lot of
[34:38] straining. There's a lot of groaning and
[34:39] walking a Christian life, but there is
[34:41] no straining and growing and pressing
[34:43] and trying in believing.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; That is not faith. Amen. If we've worked
[34:49] our way into believing and through much
[34:51] study and much straining and putting the
[34:53] word puzzle together and trying and
[34:55] trying again, I FINALLY GOT TO THE PLACE
[34:57] WHERE I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN THE
[34:58] MESSAGE. THAT WASN'T FAITH. AND THAT
[35:00] WASN'T A revelation from the father.
[35:02] That was an intellectual exercise that
[35:04] put it together in a way till YOU COULD
[35:05] FINALLY ACCEPT IT. AMEN.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; BUT REAL FAITH ACCEPTS IT EVEN WHEN the
[35:12] pieces don't seem to match.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem to line up. I can't make
[35:18] sense of it. I can't explain it. I don't
[35:20] know how to put it all together. But one
[35:22] thing I know is this is the words of
[35:24] eternal life. And there's no place else
[35:26] to go for this is Christ.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if he's revealed it to you by
[35:32] his grace, it's nothing you did. And
[35:35] listen, you can't earn this revelation
[35:37] by being a good boy or a good girl.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Rem said, "Above
[35:42] everything else, pray for revelation."
[35:44] But don't pray for revelation in a way
[35:46] of saying, "God, I've been a good boy.
[35:47] I've been following the message for so
[35:48] long. Would you give me revelation?"
[35:50] JUST SAY, "GOD, BY YOUR GRACE, GIVE me
[35:51] revelation." It's not something we're
[35:53] going to strain to receive. It's
[35:55] something that he's going to give by
[35:56] grace.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; It's nothing you did. You didn't work
[36:00] yourself up to faith. You ever have
[36:02] faith, it's given to you by the grace of
[36:04] God.
[36:05] and God reveals it to you. Therefore,
[36:07] faith is a revelation and the whole
[36:09] church of God is built upon the
[36:12] revelation.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say,
[36:18] "But just as sure as there is false,
[36:21] there is a true. There has to be a good
[36:24] dollar before a bogus dollar can be made
[36:26] off of it." Isn't that right? If it
[36:28] wasn't, why the bogus would be the real?
[36:30] So now it's up to your discernment.
[36:34] Yeah.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a bogus and there's a real,
[36:37] you can't have a bogus unless you have a
[36:39] real.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; So, if there's false prophets in the
[36:43] world, there must be a true prophet
[36:45] somewhere.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; If there's false religion, there must be
[36:48] a true religion. False Christianity has
[36:49] to be true. You understand what I'm
[36:51] saying? You can't have a bogus unless
[36:53] there's a real somewhere. You can't have
[36:54] a false unless there's a real. And now
[36:57] there's a true genuine and there's an
[36:59] impostor or a false out there. Brother
[37:01] Bam said, "NOW IT'S UP TO your
[37:03] discernment."
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Like, "Please don't do this to me. Just
[37:09] tell me what's right and what's wrong."
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't come that way. Now, it's
[37:14] up to your discernment.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Now, it's up to you.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. To whatever is inside of you,
[37:21] whatever God has given you, amen, to
[37:24] discern whether this is true or not
[37:26] true.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] Oh, praise God.
[37:35] I didn't I jumped forward and I jumped
[37:36] back for a reason. I'm supposed to
[37:38] mention something
[37:40] and I don't want to forget.
[37:42] We all know the story of brother
[37:44] Brandham when God had come to him and
[37:46] told him to speak the squirrels into
[37:48] existence and happened on two different
[37:50] occasions. And we know that story, but I
[37:52] want to pick up when he was in brother
[37:54] Wright's house telling the story. And we
[37:57] all know very well that Hattie Wright
[37:59] said the right thing. But I want I I I
[38:01] took another look at it and I want to
[38:03] look at it together today tonight in the
[38:06] message. Go tell. This is one of the
[38:07] many places he tells the story. He said,
[38:10] "The only thing I know that Jehovah is
[38:13] still Jehovah Gyra. He's able to provide
[38:15] a sacrifice." And there's many other
[38:18] places that he says this. And he says it
[38:21] many times. He says, "All I know is
[38:23] still Jehovah Gyra." And in one place he
[38:25] says, "The same one that provided a ram
[38:27] for Abraham."
[38:29] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "See, I had need of
[38:31] squirrels." So he he goes back to this
[38:34] Jehovah Gyra and God being the provider
[38:37] and God being the one who created a ram
[38:40] where there was no ram. It was an
[38:42] instant creation, a full creation by the
[38:45] power of God.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; We're all on the same page as Jehovah.
[38:49] And brother Brandham said, "The only
[38:51] thing I know that Jehovah that Jehovah
[38:54] is still Jehovah Gyra, he's able to
[38:56] provide."
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And then Had and Brother Brandham says,
[38:59] "And not not knowing what she was
[39:01] saying." Had he not knowing what she was
[39:03] saying, raised up and said, "That's
[39:05] nothing but the truth, brother
[39:06] Brandham." Oh my, that was the right
[39:09] thing to say. That was the right thing
[39:12] to say. Oh man, if you can hone in on
[39:14] anything, hone on this. That was the
[39:17] right thing to say. I want to start
[39:19] saying the right thing about the word
[39:21] &gt;&gt; because she said the right thing. There
[39:23] was a tremendous reward that came her
[39:25] way. And about that time, the power of
[39:27] God struck that place. And I never felt
[39:29] such an anointing. When it did, I said,
[39:31] "Hattie, thus sayeth the Lord, ask what
[39:34] you will. I don't care what it is. God
[39:37] has given me the authority to give you
[39:38] your heart's desire right now. If you
[39:41] ask for a million dollars, you can have
[39:43] it. Ask for that little crippled girl to
[39:45] walk, get up and walk, she can have it.
[39:47] ask for anything. And we know she asked
[39:49] for the salvation of her two boys and he
[39:51] said, "I give them to you in the name of
[39:52] Jesus Christ." Amen. And they fell over
[39:55] her knees weeping and repenting. Amen.
[39:57] So So we know she got amen the desire of
[40:00] her heart. But but when brother Benham
[40:02] says this, he says, "I never felt such
[40:06] an anointing."
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Have brother Brenham felt anointings
[40:09] before?
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; This is, you know, he's telling this in
[40:12] 1960. He's felt anointings. He's been
[40:15] anointed for many things. He's been in
[40:17] visions. He's had miracles take place
[40:18] before his eyes. Supernatural, off the
[40:21] charts. He's met an angel. Amen. He's
[40:23] seen pillars of fire. He's seen all
[40:26] kinds of things. But but something about
[40:28] what had he did. Amen. So please God
[40:32] that a power of God fell so strong. He
[40:34] said, "I NEVER FELT such an anointing."
[40:37] And God told the prophet, "GIVE HER
[40:39] WHATEVER SHE WANTS."
[40:41] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.
[40:43] THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN ANY OTHER time in his
[40:45] ministry. WE HAVEN'T SEEN anything like
[40:47] this ON THIS MAGNITUDE. WHAT WAS IT THAT
[40:50] GOD WAS so pleased with? Because brother
[40:53] Benham was talking about creating
[40:54] squirrels in the woods. And brother
[40:56] Benham was out THERE ALL BY HIMSELF.
[40:58] THERE WAS NOBODY TO WATCH. THERE WAS
[41:00] NOBODY TO PROVE. THERE WAS NO CAMERAS.
[41:02] AMEN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE HAD A
[41:04] PICTURE of the squirrels.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You better BELIEVE IF I SPOKE SQUIRRELS
[41:10] IN EXISTENCE, I'M WE'RE REACHING FOR MY
[41:12] PHONE. AMEN. I'M NOBODY'S GOING TO
[41:14] BELIEVE THIS. YEAH. YEAH. AMEN.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; But brother Bam had nothing. He was
[41:19] there by himself. He heard the VOICE OF
[41:20] GOD. AND BROTHER BAM IS SITTING HERE IN
[41:22] BROTHER WRIGHT'S HOUSE, A HUMBLE LITTLE
[41:24] HOUSE. AND HADRIGHT, a humble little
[41:26] woman. Amen. And and he's in THIS HOUSE
[41:29] JUST DESCRIBING WHAT GOD HAD DONE. AND
[41:31] LISTEN, IT WASN'T THAT SHE BELIEVED the
[41:33] miracle. Amen. Alone. That was SO
[41:35] PROFOUND TO GOD. BUT WHEN BROTHER
[41:37] BRANDHAM TOOK THAT MIRACLE and said,
[41:39] "This is none other than Jehovah Gyra.
[41:42] This is the same one that pre provided
[41:44] the ram for Abraham. He's still the same
[41:47] Jehovah. HE'S THE SAME GOD. WHAT WAS
[41:48] BROTHER BAM DOING? HE WAS TAKING THE
[41:50] MIRACLE AND HE WAS ATTACHING IT TO THE
[41:52] WORD and the word was explaining the
[41:54] miracle AND SAYING THIS IS THE SAME GOD
[41:57] THAT created a ram for Abraham IS THE
[41:59] SAME GOD THAT created squirrels in the
[42:01] woods. And Hattie right said THAT'S
[42:04] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT SHE BELIEVED BROTHER
[42:08] BRANDHAM CREATED SQUIRRELS ALONE. THAT
[42:10] WAS WONDERFUL. I MEAN, I BELIEVE
[42:12] EVERYBODY SITTING AROUND THAT TABLE
[42:14] believed they were friends of brother
[42:15] Brennham. They had seen the miraculous.
[42:17] They believed that he that he had he had
[42:20] had that experience and he spoke the
[42:22] word and squirrels were created. I think
[42:24] it was something deeper than that. It
[42:26] was THE FACT THAT HATTIE, AMEN, a little
[42:28] humble woman with not much education,
[42:30] with not many resources, no theologian
[42:33] whatsoever, couldn't hardly explain
[42:35] anything. When when brother Brennham
[42:37] cited the scriptures and SAID, "THIS IS
[42:39] THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ABRAHAM.
[42:41] THIS IS THE SAME JEHOVAH GYRA." SHE'S
[42:44] CONFIRMING THE WORD, NOT THE MIRACLE,
[42:46] THE WORD. SHE'S SAYING THAT AIN'T
[42:48] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. WHAT YOU'RE
[42:50] SAYING IS TRUE. THIS IS JEHOVAH GYRA.
[42:53] THIS IS GOD. THIS IS THE WORD. AND WHEN
[42:55] SHE RECOGNIZED THE WORD AND
[42:56] MANIFESTATION IN HER DAY AND COULD
[42:58] BOLDLY CLAIM IT WITHOUT EVIDENCES, GOD
[43:01] WAS SO HAPPY WITH THAT KIND OF
[43:03] REVELATION. HE SAID, "YOU GIVE HER
[43:05] WHATEVER she wants."
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; This is what makes God happy.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; There's miracles that take place all
[43:18] over the world. There's still people
[43:20] with faith. Amen. If you operate by
[43:22] faith, God honors faith. Wherever faith
[43:24] is, Brother Ram taught us this. Amen.
[43:26] There's there's healings all over the
[43:27] place. There's miracles that take place
[43:29] all over the place. Amen. and believing
[43:31] in the miracle that took place in a
[43:33] church somewhere or in a MINISTRY
[43:35] SOMEWHERE. AMEN. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
[43:37] CAUSING THIS ANOINTING TO come down and
[43:39] God to grant this woman a gift like he
[43:40] gave nobody else. Amen. What was h what
[43:43] was it is when brother Brandham says
[43:45] this is amen representation of Jehovah
[43:49] Gyra. THE SAME ONE THAT WAS ON MOUNT
[43:51] MARIAH and provided a lamb for Abraham
[43:53] IS THE SAME GOD THAT WAS WITH ME IN THE
[43:55] WOODS AND PROVIDED THESE SQUIRRELS.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN THAT WOMAN RECOGNIZED
[44:01] THAT PROPHET'S WORD WAS TRUE IN THE
[44:03] SCRIPTURE AND GOD AND SHE SAID THAT'S
[44:05] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT
[44:07] THRILLED THE HEART OF GOD.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Guess what? YOU AND I COULD DO THE SAME
[44:11] THING TODAY. AMEN. WE'VE GOT THE SAME
[44:13] thing that rests inside of us that WAS
[44:14] IN H HAD RIGHT. When we see the word
[44:16] made MANIFEST IN OUR DAY, THERE'S
[44:18] SOMETHING IN US THAT SAY IT'S TRUE. IT'S
[44:20] NOTHING BUT TRUE. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
[44:22] BUT THAT IT'S TRUE.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE BOLDLY DECLARE IT IS TRUE, I
[44:27] believe it blesses God. Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; How did Hadtie know?
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Was it a Bible study?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Was it her doctorate degree?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; I believe she had discernment.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; I believe she could perceive
[44:47] &gt;&gt; that this was a man of God and discern
[44:49] that he was telling the truth. And when
[44:51] he got to the scriptural part, Brother
[44:53] Brenam says she was a little woman just
[44:54] sitting off in the corner.
[44:57] She wasn't in the main body of the
[44:58] conversation. She wasn't right in the
[44:59] middle of things that were happening.
[45:00] She was just off to the side just
[45:02] listening from the corner. But from her
[45:05] little corner seat outside the main
[45:07] circle of conversation when he got to
[45:09] the the part that this is the word.
[45:11] Amen. She said that she just blasted out
[45:13] that's nothing but the truth. And God
[45:15] was pleased.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; She had discernment.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't an intellectual
[45:20] conception. It was discernment.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandham says. said,
[45:25] "Little old Hattie right there sitting
[45:27] in the back of the building with her
[45:28] heart off the things of the world." She
[45:31] was believing. She said, "Brother
[45:33] Benham, that's nothing but the truth.
[45:35] She didn't just say it from here. God
[45:38] spoke out of her heart."
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was more that wasn't a brain.
[45:44] That wasn't a an understanding from the
[45:46] mind. That wasn't a being able to say,
[45:48] "Well, that makes sense to me because of
[45:51] this and that." I could compute and
[45:53] calculate and say po probably the the
[45:55] possibilities ARE HIGH. IT HAD NOTHING
[45:58] TO DO with any of that. It came from
[45:59] DOWN IN HER SOUL AND SOMETHING ROSE UP
[46:02] AND SAID THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God be praised.
[46:09] God let us operate with discernment.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2, he says, "For by grace
[46:16] are you saved through faith and that not
[46:19] of yourselves. It is a gift of God.
[46:23] Little Haddie didn't come up with this
[46:25] on her own. She had a gift of God to
[46:28] believe.
[46:31] It says in adoption, he says by faith
[46:33] are you saved. That's your faith in God.
[46:36] He said the blood keeps you clean from
[46:38] sin because it makes a sacrifice. The
[46:41] blood doesn't save you. The blood keeps
[46:44] you clean.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; How do you say saved? By faith are you
[46:48] saved and that by God's fornowledge
[46:50] calling you, you are saved and the blood
[46:51] makes an atonement constantly keeping
[46:53] you clean. Now, this is a this is a
[46:56] statement that can be confusing. Amen.
[46:58] And so, I want to spend just a moment on
[47:00] it. Uh if we could talk about it now, to
[47:04] say the blood doesn't save you. Amen. We
[47:07] know that we're saved by the blood of
[47:09] God.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[47:13] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Don't be afraid.
[47:14] You're not contradicting the prophet.
[47:17] We've been saved by the blood of God.
[47:19] The the blood of Jesus Christ was the
[47:21] purchase price for all of redemption. He
[47:23] bought us all back. There there would
[47:26] there would be no salvation in the way
[47:28] of redemption and restoration without
[47:30] the shedding of blood.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; So we're saved by the blood of God.
[47:34] Amen. It was Jesus blood that was shed
[47:36] shed. Amen. That brought us into a
[47:38] salvation experience with God. Amen. All
[47:41] of that is true. But listen, Jesus, when
[47:44] he shed his blood, he purchased all of
[47:48] creation.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Everything that was ever created upon
[47:57] the earth, he purchased back.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; So, every Listen, oh man, this is a hard
[48:04] thing to say, but I I just pray that you
[48:06] understand what I'm saying.
[48:08] Everyone that goes uh goes to heaven,
[48:11] let's say,
[48:13] &gt;&gt; was purchased by the blood of Jesus
[48:14] Christ.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Everyone that burns in the lake of fire
[48:18] was also purchased.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; By the blood of Jesus Christ.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Y
[48:23] &gt;&gt; So you can't just say, "I'm saved by the
[48:24] blood." Anybody that's ever saved was
[48:26] saved by the blood.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The blood bought all back. But what
[48:30] brings me into that salvation? What
[48:32] brings me into that salvation experience
[48:34] and connects me with redemption IS
[48:36] FAITH. I HAVE TO HAVE FAITH THAT THAT
[48:38] BLOOD WAS SHED FOR ME. THAT THAT BLOOD
[48:40] IS FOR ME. THAT HE TOOK MY place on
[48:43] Calvary. And when he shed his blood, it
[48:44] was for my sins and for my redemption
[48:46] and paid the price for me. AND I HAVE BY
[48:48] FAITH COME INTO experience of
[48:51] reconciliation with God and salvation
[48:53] and redemption BECAUSE OF MY FAITH in
[48:55] the blood.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; If I don't believe in it, it doesn't do
[48:59] me the benefit that it could. Amen.
[49:01] Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brandham said,
[49:04] "The blood doesn't save you."
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he bought everything.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes into this in
[49:13] in in the uh church ages book. HE SAYS
[49:16] BECAUSE HE BOUGHT IT, he has rights to
[49:19] it all. And he can pass judgment and do
[49:22] with what he owns, with what he wishes.
[49:24] That's why at the white throne judgment,
[49:26] he can extend mercy and allow entrance
[49:29] into eternal life TO THOSE DON'T EVEN
[49:31] KNOW WHY THEY'RE GOING IN.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NO IDEA. HE SAYS, "BECAUSE YOU
[49:36] did this to the least of you." They
[49:37] said, "When did we do? WE HAD NO IDEA
[49:39] WHAT WE DID. WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE WE
[49:41] SERVED YOU. WE HAD no idea WHAT WAS
[49:42] HAPPENING OR HOW WE GOT SAVED OR HOW WE
[49:44] COME IN." IT WASN'T THEIR FAITH IN THE
[49:46] BLOOD. AMEN. HIS BLOOD PURCHASED THEM.
[49:48] They came in by his grace and by his
[49:50] mercy.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; BUT HE BOUGHT IT ALL. SO BECAUSE HE OWNS
[49:56] IT, he can pass this judgment. AMEN. AND
[49:58] THERE'S THOSE, AMEN. THAT'LL GO INTO THE
[50:00] LAKE OF FIRE and eternal damnation.
[50:02] Amen. In absolute annihilation and
[50:04] destruction. AMEN. THEY WERE ALSO
[50:06] PURCHASED. BUT BECAUSE HE owns it, he's
[50:08] the one who has the right to judge.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; But for us, WE'VE ALREADY COME INTO
[50:14] salvation by faith. AND WE WILL BYPASS
[50:16] JUDGMENT. WE WILL BYPASS EVERYTHING.
[50:19] AMEN. Because by gra by by by grace you
[50:22] are saved through faith.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And that not of yourself. That is the
[50:26] gift of God.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; So now the faith is what we're saved by.
[50:33] And the blood because it was shed is
[50:35] constantly making atonement. We're
[50:36] constantly being forgiven for our wrongs
[50:39] because the blood was shed
[50:41] &gt;&gt; for us.
[50:43] Praise God.
[50:45] So it's by faith.
[50:48] the message paradox. He said, "It isn't
[50:50] necessary to come up here and kneel down
[50:52] and pray through until you're saved."
[50:55] What a statement. I love this. Listen,
[50:59] Brother Brandham wouldn't have said this
[51:00] in 1953,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; 1954, 1955 when the campaigns were going
[51:05] on in the revival,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; but he comes in 1965 and he's constantly
[51:09] trying to get us to operate by faith on
[51:11] the word to recognize something higher.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Said it isn't necessary to come up here
[51:15] and kneel down and pray through until
[51:17] you're saved. Now, I want to make a
[51:18] disclaimer here. There ain't a thing
[51:20] wrong with it either.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; It's good for us. Amen. It's good to put
[51:24] a steak down. It's good to weep at an
[51:25] altar. It's good to find a place to
[51:27] repent and give your heart to the Lord
[51:29] and and say, "And from this moment on, I
[51:31] I'm I'm surrendering myself to God.
[51:33] There ain't a thing in the world wrong
[51:34] with it, friends."
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But it's not necessary for salvation.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Not necessary to come up here and kneel
[51:43] down and pray through until you're
[51:44] saved. You're saved already, but you
[51:47] have to accept it. Your praying doesn't
[51:50] do it. Your faith is what you're saved
[51:52] by, not by prayer. But by faith are you
[51:56] saved. Same thing by healing. I'm sure
[51:58] we all understand that.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] Listen, it's not even it's not even the
[52:06] laying on of hands that heals you.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; It's your faith in the laying on of
[52:11] hands that heals you. It's because you
[52:13] believe the word. When the word says
[52:14] they shall lay hands on the sick, they
[52:15] shall recover. AMEN. IT'S NOT THE SIMPLE
[52:17] ACT of just touching you that does it.
[52:19] Amen. Because if you didn't believe it
[52:21] will work, it won't work.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN JUST THE
[52:25] ACTION. THERE'S GOT TO BE FAITH in the
[52:27] action. You have to believe that this is
[52:29] the word of God and the word of God is
[52:31] true and the word of God won't fail. AND
[52:33] WHEN IT STRIKES YOUR SOUL LIKE THAT AND
[52:34] YOU KNOW IF THIS BROTHER lays hands on
[52:36] me, I'll be well. THEN YOU'LL BE WELL.
[52:38] IT WAS YOUR FAITH.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Brandham REFERENCES THE
[52:43] WOMAN, AMEN, who touched the hem of his
[52:45] garment. Amen. And was made whole. Amen.
[52:48] She had some discernment. There was
[52:49] SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER. SHE KNEW THAT
[52:51] IF I CAN BUT TOUCH the hem of HIS
[52:53] GARMENT, I'LL BE MADE EVERY BIT. AND SHE
[52:55] SHE CRAWLED THROUGH THE CROWD. AMEN. SHE
[52:57] WRETCHED UP. SHE TOUCHED the hem of his
[52:59] garment. Brother Brandham said that
[53:01] Jesus COULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT
[53:03] PHYSICALLY.
[53:04] AMEN.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; BUT IT TOUCHED SOMETHING IN HIM
[53:07] SPIRITUALLY CUZ VIRTUE WENT OUT OF HIM
[53:09] and he knew somebody had touched him AND
[53:11] BEGAN TO ASK. AND WHEN HE went over
[53:12] there and he looked at the LITTLE WOMAN
[53:14] AND FINALLY HE FOUND her and she
[53:15] confessed WHAT SHE HAD DONE. HE LOOKED
[53:17] AT HER and says, "Be of good cheer. Thy
[53:20] faith has made thee whole."
[53:22] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT WASN'T JESUS'S
[53:25] PRAYER. HE NEVER prayed for her.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't pray for her. YEAH.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T LAY HANDS on her. It was her
[53:35] faith.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Something in her TOLD HER THAT IF I OH,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; If I could but touch the hem of HIS
[53:43] GARMENT AND GOD HONORED HER FAITH.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And it brought the result.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love the word.
[53:56] Brother Benham says
[53:59] when when he was talking about Peter and
[54:03] Peter by a divine revelation from the
[54:06] father was able to declare who Jesus was
[54:09] in Matthew 16. You see Peter used that
[54:12] terminology and we
[54:16] know and we believe and he's talking
[54:18] about the 12.
[54:20] But there was one we that didn't believe
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and that was Judas.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; And Judas acted like he believed. He
[54:29] looked like he believed.
[54:32] He went along with everybody that
[54:34] believed,
[54:35] but it was made manifest in the end.
[54:39] In the message identification,
[54:42] brother Brandham and this is from 1964.
[54:44] Brother Brham says he what made him
[54:46] turn? He actually doubted the claims of
[54:49] Christ being the word.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; What made Judas turn on Jesus? He said
[54:54] he actually doubted the claims of Christ
[54:56] being the word.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He could see that man, eat with him,
[55:00] fish with him out there, and everything
[55:02] else. And him being the word, he
[55:04] couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe
[55:07] he was God.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; But he was.
[55:11] Judas's character caused him to do this.
[55:14] Has your character done the same?
[55:15] Remember Judas was very religious.
[55:19] So it didn't matter how religious Judas
[55:21] was. Amen. Judas when it came down to
[55:25] it, he heard the same thing Peter heard.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But Peter's discernment told him that
[55:31] this is this is the words of eternal
[55:32] life. This is Messiah. This is the son
[55:34] of God.
[55:36] And Judas, listen, he may have went
[55:39] along with it. Maybe he even tried to
[55:41] believe it. May may he was he was in the
[55:43] mix. He was all around. When he saw the
[55:45] miracles, he saw that was happen. He
[55:47] knew this was a man of God. He knew this
[55:49] was a miracle worker. He he HAD HE HAD
[55:51] ALL OF those same things and he heard
[55:52] the parables and had the explanation in
[55:55] the closed door meeting when they sat to
[55:57] eat. He had everything that Peter had.
[55:59] But Peter's discernment said, "This is
[56:01] the son of the living God." Judas's that
[56:04] Judas's discernment said, "I, you know,
[56:07] he's a he's a miracle worker, definitely
[56:09] a prophet. He's a good man,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:13] But him being the word, I him being God,
[56:16] I I just can't go there.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; It was his discernment of what he heard
[56:24] and saw
[56:26] &gt;&gt; that determined his eternal destination.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; He got the inside scoop.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He was in the private meetings.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; He was in the boat rides. He was at the
[56:38] meals. He was there when Jesus broke
[56:41] down the parables.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He saw more and heard more.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; But he needed more than hearing and
[56:52] seeing.
[56:53] If hearing and seeing the truth and
[56:55] being in a private door meeting with
[56:57] Jesus and Jesus breaking down the
[56:58] parable to you and explaining what he
[57:01] didn't explain to everybody else, that
[57:02] wasn't enough to save Judas
[57:05] &gt;&gt; because of his discernment of what he
[57:07] heard
[57:08] &gt;&gt; was wrong.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. God be praised.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how much we know about
[57:18] the message.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; It's our discernment of what the message
[57:21] is.
[57:24] says,
[57:25] "And notice Cain, he didn't want no
[57:28] blood sacrifice. He came down and
[57:31] offered the fruit or the fields of
[57:32] beauty upon his altar, very religious,
[57:35] done everything that just exactly like
[57:37] Abel done, offered a sacrifice, fell
[57:39] down before God in worship, obedient in
[57:41] every way, but without the revelation of
[57:44] the word." And the word was from the
[57:47] beginning God's plan. But God revealed
[57:51] by revelation that the very thing that
[57:53] he vindicated and punctuated that was
[57:55] right, not religion, not an altar, not
[57:58] belonging to church, not making
[58:00] sacrifice, not being sincere, but by the
[58:03] revelation of the word of God.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; That was God's plan from the beginning.
[58:08] The revelation of the word of God.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Our discernment of what we see and what
[58:13] we hear.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Man, that's why formalized religion
[58:17] doesn't work.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Formalized religion has come up
[58:20] with a formula to salvation. They have
[58:22] an absolute formula. They preach it as a
[58:25] formula. They teach it as a formula. The
[58:28] formula is that if you believe that
[58:30] Jesus Christ was the son of God and he
[58:32] died for the sins of the world and he
[58:34] shed his blood 2,000 years ago and you
[58:36] make a mental confession of that and you
[58:38] confess that's true and believe you're
[58:40] part of that and you come up and make a
[58:42] a statement before the church or shake
[58:44] the pastor's hand. Listen, I used to
[58:46] never understand what Brother Brena
[58:47] meant by come shake the pastor's hand.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; But when we were on vacation one time,
[58:52] we were down in Georgia on vacation, the
[58:54] whole family, and there was a a Baptist
[58:56] church down the road that we had seen.
[58:57] It was just a couple miles down the
[58:59] road. And on Sunday morning, I said,
[59:00] "Let's go to church." So, we all got
[59:02] ready. We all went to church, and we sat
[59:04] through that Baptist church. And and and
[59:06] it was it was it was just a a normal
[59:09] run-of-the-mill regular Baptist church.
[59:11] The pastor was a good guy. I actually
[59:14] liked him. The people were friendly.
[59:16] Amen. And I believed I discerned
[59:19] that this pastor was sincere.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; That's why my heart went out to him.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But so so I went every service that they
[59:27] had that week. My family didn't go to
[59:30] the evening or the midweek, but they
[59:31] went to the Sunday morning. But I
[59:32] couldn't stay away. I just kept going
[59:34] back cuz my heart was burdened for this
[59:35] man. AMEN. BUT WHILE I WAS THERE, I
[59:38] WATCHED that every service. I think I
[59:40] went to three or four services. I don't
[59:42] remember. every service at the end he
[59:45] would give an invitation. Does anybody
[59:47] want to give their heart to the Lord?
[59:48] Does anybody want to accept Jesus as
[59:49] their savior? And he said the same thing
[59:51] almost every time. Then he'd walk off
[59:52] the pullpit and go and stand in front of
[59:54] the church and he was waiting. And the
[59:56] first Sunday the morning we were there,
[59:57] I just watched him. I didn't know what
[59:59] he was doing. And and and he just waited
[1:00:01] there. And then then he went back up and
[1:00:02] they closed in a song and they went. But
[1:00:04] one of the services I was there, there
[1:00:05] was a young man there that wanted to
[1:00:07] give his heart to the Lord. Amen. and he
[1:00:09] come down and he walked down and he
[1:00:11] shook the pastor's hand
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; and he just extended the right hand of
[1:00:17] fellowship. He accepted the invitation.
[1:00:20] He put his arm around him and said, "Now
[1:00:22] he's a Christian. He's saved."
[1:00:27] Amen.
[1:00:29] And I don't know the sincerity of that
[1:00:31] young man's heart. I don't know where he
[1:00:32] is with God. I'm not passing a judgment
[1:00:34] on his salvation or where he's at. I'm
[1:00:36] just saying I saw with my own eyes the
[1:00:38] things Brother Benham was talking about.
[1:00:40] That's formalized religion. That's
[1:00:42] formalized salvation. Amen. That's a
[1:00:44] formula and that's that that's
[1:00:46] replicated over and over all the time.
[1:00:48] Sometimes it's come to the altar.
[1:00:50] Sometimes it's sign a pledge. Sometimes
[1:00:51] it's go through catechism. THERE'S SOME
[1:00:53] WAY in which you're inaugurated and
[1:00:55] accepted into the church and come into
[1:00:57] salvation. But listen, none of that is
[1:00:59] going to hold up and work. It's got to
[1:01:01] be an individual revelation to you that
[1:01:03] you you have met Jesus Christ yourself.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And how do you meet whom you've never
[1:01:10] been introduced to? Because this message
[1:01:11] came to introduce the bridegroom to the
[1:01:14] bride.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not going to be my words
[1:01:18] of introduction and your mental
[1:01:20] acknowledgement that I'm telling you the
[1:01:22] truth IS GOING TO WORK. IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:01:23] SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT DEEPER than that.
[1:01:25] I can bring an introduction. I can
[1:01:27] preach the word by the grace of God
[1:01:29] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:30] WORK AND GO OUT. BUT IT'S GOT TO STRIKE
[1:01:32] SOMETHING MORE THAN YOUR BRAIN. IT'S GOT
[1:01:34] TO STRIKE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT
[1:01:35] SAYS, "THAT'S MY LORD. THAT'S MY MAKER.
[1:01:38] THAT'S MY KING. THAT'S MY HUSBAND. AND
[1:01:40] THAT'S ALL I WANT."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than a formal
[1:01:46] religion. Got to be more than a Sunday
[1:01:48] routine. It's got to be There's got to
[1:01:50] be a discernment of what we hear
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; and what we see.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:59] Brother says, "How far away from
[1:02:01] discernment can you wander with your
[1:02:03] intellectual theologies,
[1:02:05] with your mental conception of anything?
[1:02:08] My gracious and lost friend, can you not
[1:02:10] understand that this Bible is
[1:02:12] spiritually interpreted?"
[1:02:14] Jesus thanked the father he'd hid it
[1:02:16] from the educated and shrewd and wise
[1:02:18] and prudent and would reveal it to babes
[1:02:21] such as would come to Calvary.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. How far from discernment can you
[1:02:26] wander with your intellectual the
[1:02:28] theologies
[1:02:30] and the mental conception? That stuff
[1:02:32] just takes us further away.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I say, God, give me a revelation of your
[1:02:37] word.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hadtie Wright didn't have
[1:02:42] intellectual theologies.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; She had the ability to believe.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for all we know,
[1:02:54] Peter might have been a lot like had he
[1:02:55] right.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; He was a fisherman.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; He was uneducated. He couldn't sign his
[1:03:02] own name.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; We don't know if he was polished or he
[1:03:06] was rough. We We don't know all of these
[1:03:07] things. But he could catch what Judas
[1:03:10] wasn't catching.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He could catch what the Sanhedrin wasn't
[1:03:14] catching. He could believe, Amen. what
[1:03:16] what the polished couldn't believe and
[1:03:17] what the educated couldn't believe.
[1:03:22] In 1 Corinthians 2:11
[1:03:27] he says, "For what man knoweth the
[1:03:29] things of a man, save the spirit of man
[1:03:31] which is in him? Even so the things of
[1:03:33] God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[1:03:35] God. Now we have received not the spirit
[1:03:38] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[1:03:40] God, that we might know the things that
[1:03:42] are freely given to us." See this? That
[1:03:45] we might know the things that are freely
[1:03:47] given to us. Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; How did Peter know
[1:03:51] that Jesus alone had the words of
[1:03:53] eternal life? He knew
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; by discernment. How did Hadtie know that
[1:03:59] what brother Brandham experienced in the
[1:04:00] woods was the same God and the same
[1:04:02] thing that happened to Abraham on Mount
[1:04:05] Mariah? She just knew.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] which things also we speak not in the
[1:04:11] words which man's wisdom teacheth, but
[1:04:13] which the Holy Ghost teacheth, conspir
[1:04:15] comparing spiritual things with
[1:04:17] spiritual. But the natural man receiveth
[1:04:19] not the things of the spirit of God, for
[1:04:21] they are foolishness unto him, neither
[1:04:23] can he know them, because they are
[1:04:25] spiritually discerned.
[1:04:27] Amen. Not mentally, but spiritually
[1:04:29] discerned. And this word discern, here's
[1:04:31] the definition.
[1:04:33] It's used in the New Testament as
[1:04:35] examine, judge, ask questions, search or
[1:04:38] discern. It means to examine or to judge
[1:04:41] or to investigate. To examine, inquire
[1:04:44] into, scrutinize, sift, question,
[1:04:46] especially in a forensic sense of of a
[1:04:49] judge. To hold an investigation, to
[1:04:51] interrogate, examine the accused or the
[1:04:53] witness. Amen. What a word. These things
[1:04:56] that are freely given to us, they are
[1:04:58] spiritually discerned. The spirit can
[1:05:00] distinguish what's right and wrong. It
[1:05:02] can poke through all kinds of stuff and
[1:05:04] find out where the truth is.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he's he's telling us that by
[1:05:09] the spirit of God, the natural man,
[1:05:10] verse 14, the natural man receiveth not
[1:05:13] the things of the spirit of God, for
[1:05:14] they're foolishness unto him, neither
[1:05:16] can he know them because they are
[1:05:18] spiritually discerned. Amen. It's that
[1:05:21] THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AMEN, is the one who
[1:05:23] brings this this discernment to our
[1:05:25] eyes. The one who can tell us what's
[1:05:27] true and not true. who can discern, who
[1:05:30] can read between the lines, who can
[1:05:32] pierce through, amen, the camouflage of
[1:05:34] something and get down to the
[1:05:35] nitty-gritty and said, "This is right."
[1:05:37] Or, "No, there's something wrong with
[1:05:38] that."
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Not exactly right.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of God that does that
[1:05:43] for spiritually discerned. They're
[1:05:46] examined. They're judged. Amen. Prophet
[1:05:50] of God says, "The only thing that you
[1:05:51] have to recognize that he is not a myth.
[1:05:54] He's not some historical god. He's a God
[1:05:57] present. Jesus Christ is saying
[1:05:58] yesterday, today, and forever. Right
[1:06:00] now, do you believe he's here?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Would you discern it?
[1:06:04] I want to turn my back to this audience.
[1:06:07] Now, I'm praying the Holy Ghost will
[1:06:09] prove what I've done. I've said tonight,
[1:06:11] the closing of this message, that the
[1:06:13] same signs that Jesus said was given to
[1:06:15] Sodom, will be given to this generation.
[1:06:17] As it was in the days of Sodom, show so
[1:06:20] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:06:22] man. Then you discern what spirits hear.
[1:06:27] Then you discern what spirits here,
[1:06:30] brother Bam. Now, all the way back in
[1:06:33] 59, he's turning his back to the
[1:06:35] congregation and he's saying, Jesus
[1:06:36] says, "As it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:06:39] so shall it be." Amen. In the revealing
[1:06:41] of the son of man. And now, Brother
[1:06:43] Ram's going to turn his back and show
[1:06:44] the same sign that was shown, amen, uh
[1:06:47] on the plains that day, he's going to
[1:06:49] show the same sign. And he says, "Now
[1:06:51] you discern what spirit this is."
[1:06:54] MANY WALKED AWAY AND SAID, "THAT man's
[1:06:56] fanatical." I mean, that that that's
[1:06:58] mental telepathy. That's what whatever
[1:07:00] they went away and whatever it was that
[1:07:02] they believed. Amen. But there was a few
[1:07:04] there that said that's God.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture being fulfilled.
[1:07:09] THAT'S NOT JUST a miracle. THAT'S NOT
[1:07:10] JUST A SIGN. THIS IS WHY BROTHER
[1:07:12] BRANDHAM SAID, "I WOULDN'T FOLLOW OIL IN
[1:07:14] THE hands or blood in the hand or oil on
[1:07:16] YOUR FOREHEAD." THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF
[1:07:18] PEOPLE THAT RAISED up after brother
[1:07:20] Brandham AND THEY HAD ALL kinds of
[1:07:22] signs. Amen. They the AA Allen had them
[1:07:24] and there was other men that had signs
[1:07:26] and they would they would get into the
[1:07:28] spirit or they would call a woman up one
[1:07:30] time AND SHE WOULD HAVE OIL IN her hands
[1:07:31] of and then that oil would be anointing
[1:07:33] oil that would heal people and they
[1:07:35] would pray for him. Brother Brandham
[1:07:36] said, "I wouldn't believe that sign."
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WERE THEY WHY WHY IS THE BRIDE OF
[1:07:42] CHRIST SUPPOSED TO BE ACCEPTED? Brother
[1:07:44] Brandham turning his back to a crowd and
[1:07:45] discerning people and say, "You over
[1:07:47] here in the red dress, you've got
[1:07:49] cancer. You over here, you've got A BACK
[1:07:50] PROBLEM." WHY NOT BELIEVE the oil in the
[1:07:52] hand? Why not believe the blood in the
[1:07:54] hand? Why not believe the oil on the
[1:07:56] forehead? Amen. THEY'RE ALL SUPERNATURAL
[1:07:58] SIGNS AND THEY WERE VINDICATED. THEY
[1:08:00] WERE VERIFIED. THERE'S PEOPLE TESTIFIED
[1:08:01] IT WAS TRUE AND WERE HEALED by it.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY BROTHER BRAM SAID HE
[1:08:05] WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT? HE SAID BECAUSE
[1:08:06] IT'S NOT IN THE WORD. THE SCRIPTURE
[1:08:08] NEVER TELLS US TO LOOK FOR THAT. BUT
[1:08:10] JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF
[1:08:12] LOT, IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT
[1:08:15] BE IN THE revealing of the SON OF MAN."
[1:08:16] WHAT WAS DONE TO ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED IN
[1:08:18] that day is the same sign that's coming
[1:08:20] back to Abraham and his seed this day.
[1:08:23] AND THE ELECT OF GOD SAY THAT AIN'T
[1:08:25] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; THAT WORD IS TODAY. WHAT WE SAW IS WHAT
[1:08:30] JESUS SAID. AND OUR HEARTS PUT THE TWO
[1:08:33] TOGETHER AND SAY AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HAD
[1:08:35] WRIGHT WAS ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEOLOGY,
[1:08:38] WITHOUT INTELLECTUALISM, WITHOUT A
[1:08:40] DEGREE.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; How are we able to do it? HOW DO YOU
[1:08:44] KNOW WHAT PROOF? WHAT EVIDENCE? IT'S
[1:08:47] MORE THAN JUST SEEING A MAN MAKE
[1:08:48] DISCERNMENT. AMEN. YOU CAN SEE ALL KINDS
[1:08:50] OF SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE
[1:08:52] DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF. BUT WHAT IS IT?
[1:08:54] THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT
[1:08:56] SAYS THAT'S NOT JUST A MAN DOING A
[1:08:57] MIRACLE. THAT'S A THAT'S THE FULFILLMENT
[1:08:59] OF SCRIPTURE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD
[1:09:02] PROMISED FOR THIS HOUR. THAT IS THE WORD
[1:09:04] FOR OUR DAY BEING MADE MANIFEST.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And it ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, DO YOU THINK THAT PLEASES GOD? IF IT
[1:09:14] PLEASED GOD WHEN HAD HE COULD DECLARE.
[1:09:16] WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOUR HEART LEAPS UP AND
[1:09:18] SAYS, "I KNOW IT'S TRUE. I KNOW THAT'S
[1:09:20] THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. I KNOW THAT'S
[1:09:22] MY LORD JESUS CHRIST DOING." THAT'S NOT
[1:09:24] THAT, MAN. THAT'S GOD FULFILLING HIS OWN
[1:09:26] WORD AND SHOWING TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM,
[1:09:28] HE'S HERE.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to have the privilege
[1:09:35] to say that's nothing but the truth.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 4 says, "For the word of
[1:09:45] God is quick and powerful
[1:09:48] and sharper than a two-edged sword,
[1:09:50] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:09:52] of soul and spirit and of the joints and
[1:09:56] the marorrow, and is a discerner of the
[1:09:59] thoughts and the intents of the heart."
[1:10:02] See,
[1:10:04] God, when he's giving discernment,
[1:10:08] it's discernment on the word, but it's
[1:10:12] discernment by the word.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; When brother Ram turned his back and
[1:10:18] showed the sign of Messiah, the same
[1:10:21] that was done to Abraham on the plains
[1:10:22] of memory, when he showed that, that was
[1:10:25] the word. It was the word vindicating
[1:10:27] the sign or pointing out the sign.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the manifestation of the
[1:10:32] word vindicated by the word. Amen. That
[1:10:36] the elect of God says that's nothing but
[1:10:38] the truth.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just an arbitrary sign.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Not just an arbitrary wonder,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; but the fulfillment of scripture.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] And the word is quick and powerful and
[1:10:54] sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing
[1:10:57] even to the dividing of sunder of soul
[1:10:58] and spirit and the joints and mars a
[1:11:00] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:11:02] intents of what is it that's discerning
[1:11:04] us now. What is it discerning everybody?
[1:11:07] It's the word.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; What was it that discerned had right? It
[1:11:11] was the word. What was Hadi Wright
[1:11:12] discerning? The word. What was
[1:11:14] discerning her? The word.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fact that she could discern
[1:11:18] the word was the word discerning her.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; THE VERY FACT THAT SOMETHING in you can
[1:11:25] discern this word is nothing but the
[1:11:27] truth. It's the very word discerning
[1:11:29] that you are part of this word.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's only for the elect.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this this this WORD CUTS SO
[1:11:39] SHARP. AMEN. IT DIVIDES THE SPIRIT AND
[1:11:41] THE SOUL. AMEN. WHICH THE SPIRIT AND THE
[1:11:44] SOUL OF MAN ARE SO close that sometimes
[1:11:46] it's so hard to discern which is which
[1:11:48] is the spirit which is the soul. Amen.
[1:11:51] Which is ME WHICH IS GOD. AMEN. BUT THE
[1:11:53] WORD CAN CLEAVE those two right down the
[1:11:55] middle and separate them because the
[1:11:57] word has the power of discerning every
[1:11:59] situation and every human being and
[1:12:01] everything is discerned by the word.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Peter was discerning
[1:12:10] that you're the fulfillment of the word.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's what he discerned. Amen. In John
[1:12:16] 6, when everybody walked away, he says,
[1:12:18] "Listen, I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT YOU'RE
[1:12:20] SAYING, but I know you're the word, and
[1:12:23] you alone have the words of eternal
[1:12:24] life, and everything you say is right
[1:12:26] and true."
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; He was discerning the word, but the word
[1:12:30] was discerning him.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. When you can look at
[1:12:36] that sign of the Messiah and say,
[1:12:38] "That's Christ. That's not that man.
[1:12:41] That's Christ in that man." And that's
[1:12:42] the word that's promised for our day.
[1:12:44] That's the fulfillment of the
[1:12:45] scriptures. That's nothing but the
[1:12:46] truth. Amen. What it is is the spirit of
[1:12:48] God and you giving you discernment of
[1:12:50] the word. The word discerning the
[1:12:51] situation and the prophet and the word
[1:12:53] discerning you.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; I say, "Discern me, Lord. take that word
[1:13:00] and separate spirit and soul and get
[1:13:03] down to my soul and show what's real and
[1:13:06] what's true.
[1:13:08] That's what happened to Judas.
[1:13:10] Judas looked like a believer.
[1:13:14] Judas acted like a believer. Judas cast
[1:13:17] out devils. Judas healed the sick.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Judas walked with Jesus. Judas was in
[1:13:24] the storm when the waters were calm.
[1:13:26] Judas, he saw Peter walk on the water.
[1:13:28] Yeah,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; he saw Jesus come to them walking on
[1:13:31] water. He was there for it all.
[1:13:35] And but yet the word of God when he
[1:13:39] could not accept the fullness of the
[1:13:41] word. He could go along so far, but he
[1:13:44] just couldn't see that man being the
[1:13:46] word and he couldn't see that man being
[1:13:47] God. Amen. The word began to separate
[1:13:51] what was spirit and what was soul. In
[1:13:55] Judas's spirit, he could be a believer,
[1:13:57] but not in his soul.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Could only go so deep. He could only
[1:14:01] agree so much. He could only go so far.
[1:14:04] But when it come down to it, it was the
[1:14:06] word that discerned Judas
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; because he couldn't go all the way with
[1:14:10] the word.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And so, the word is what discerned him.
[1:14:15] Amen.
[1:14:17] Brother Brennham says this, "No true
[1:14:20] believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:14:24] healthy and alive than his knowledge of
[1:14:27] and adherence to the pure word of God,
[1:14:30] as seen by multitudes of examples in the
[1:14:32] Old Testament."
[1:14:34] What is it that's going to sharpen our
[1:14:37] discernment? It's the word.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; What is it that will give us more
[1:14:41] discernment? The word. What it What is
[1:14:43] it that will perfect our discernment?
[1:14:45] our ability to rightly judge the word.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I want to look at that. Amen. God has
[1:14:51] given us, Amen. By his grace, there's a
[1:14:53] certain measure of discernment that's in
[1:14:55] the heart of the believer. Amen. By
[1:14:56] grace, amen, that can discern that this
[1:14:59] is nothing but the truth. That's the
[1:15:00] grace OF GOD. BUT YET, THAT DISCERNMENT
[1:15:03] can grow into perfection and be able to
[1:15:05] rightly divide and discern all the
[1:15:07] situations in our life by what? The same
[1:15:10] word.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I want to look at a few things that that
[1:15:13] the scripture says here as we close.
[1:15:16] No true believer is any stronger and
[1:15:20] spiritually healthy and alive than his
[1:15:23] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[1:15:25] word of God. Listen, if God by a
[1:15:28] revelation gave you a a revelation of
[1:15:31] who Jesus Christ is and brought you into
[1:15:34] a salvation experience, I mean, that is
[1:15:36] wonderful. That was discernment of the
[1:15:38] word. That was the grace of God. That
[1:15:39] was a revelation to you.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But don't stop there. Keep feeding on
[1:15:45] the word. Keep receiving more word. Keep
[1:15:48] discerning more and keep understanding
[1:15:50] more and keep growing more. Amen. We're
[1:15:52] not just to have enough discernment to
[1:15:54] say, "This is the truth. I BELIEVE THIS
[1:15:56] IS." NO. BUT KEEP GROWING IN THE WORD
[1:15:58] AND keep feasting on the word because no
[1:16:01] true believer is any stronger and
[1:16:03] spiritually healthy and ALIVE THAN HIS
[1:16:06] KNOWLEDGE OF AND adherence to the pure
[1:16:09] word of God.
[1:16:11] Let's keep receiving revelation and
[1:16:13] growing in the in the revelation of the
[1:16:15] word because it's making us stronger and
[1:16:18] spiritually healthy.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And alive.
[1:16:21] Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[1:16:30] Do you know that faith can grow?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Faith can increase. Remember I mentioned
[1:16:38] a few sermons ago, I don't remember
[1:16:39] where or when, but I mentioned the
[1:16:41] scripture where Paul says,"I desire to
[1:16:44] come to you to see you, so you can see
[1:16:46] my face so that I
[1:16:49] uh so that I can give to you what you
[1:16:52] lack in faith." I don't remember the
[1:16:54] exact words, but so that I can I do have
[1:16:57] the exact words. They're at the end of
[1:16:59] my notes.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] All right. He says,
[1:17:11] yeah, this is 1 Thessalonians 3:9 and
[1:17:14] 10. He says, "For what thanks can we
[1:17:15] render to God again for you? For all the
[1:17:17] joy we're withwith, we joy for your
[1:17:19] sakes before our God night and day,
[1:17:21] praying exceedingly that we might see
[1:17:23] your face and might perfect that which
[1:17:27] is lacking in your faith." Perfect means
[1:17:29] to complete or bring to full maturity.
[1:17:31] But these are already believers. They're
[1:17:33] already born again. They have the Holy
[1:17:34] Ghost, but yet their faith can come to
[1:17:37] perfection BY WHAT? BY A visit from
[1:17:39] Paul. So if I could just get a visit
[1:17:41] from Paul, my faith can come perfection.
[1:17:43] All I got to do is see his face. NO.
[1:17:46] WHAT WAS PAUL DOING WHEN HE WAS
[1:17:47] VISITING? He was preaching.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; It was the PREACHING OF THE WORD THAT
[1:17:51] WAS BRINGING THEIR FAITH INTO
[1:17:52] PERFECTION. AND PAUL HAD A DESIRE TO
[1:17:54] COME TO them that they might grow in
[1:17:56] faith. Amen. That their faith might
[1:17:58] increase. Amen. And if their faith
[1:17:59] increases, their discernment will
[1:18:01] increase. They'll be ABLE TO UNDERSTAND.
[1:18:03] AMEN. And point out the ws OF THE DEVIL
[1:18:05] AND STOP FALLING INTO THE TRAP BECAUSE
[1:18:07] SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT BY THE WORD will
[1:18:09] sharpen as our faith increases.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; So faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:18:15] the word of God. Now second Peter 3 says
[1:18:18] this. I'm going to finish with these two
[1:18:20] scriptures. As also in all his epistles
[1:18:24] speaking them of thing of these things
[1:18:26] in which are some things hard to be
[1:18:27] understand. And he's referring now to
[1:18:29] the apostle Paul which they that are
[1:18:31] unlearned and are unstable rest. That
[1:18:33] means they twist as they do also the
[1:18:36] other scriptures unto their own
[1:18:38] destruction.
[1:18:39] Means they couldn't receive what Paul
[1:18:41] was teaching and they were twisting them
[1:18:42] to their own understanding and it was
[1:18:44] bringing their destruction. They weren't
[1:18:46] rightly discerning Paul who he was and
[1:18:48] what right he had to say what he said.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; As they do the other scriptures under
[1:18:54] their own destruction. Ye therefore,
[1:18:57] beloved, seeing you know these things,
[1:18:58] beware before, beware, lest you also,
[1:19:01] being led away with the air of the
[1:19:03] wicked, fall from your own
[1:19:04] steadfastness.
[1:19:06] But grow in grace.
[1:19:09] But grow in grace.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And in the knowledge of our Lord and
[1:19:15] Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; To him be glory both now and forever.
[1:19:20] You mean you can grow in grace? Peter
[1:19:23] says so. Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; We can grow in the grace that God's
[1:19:26] given we can grow into the full stature
[1:19:28] of a perfect man.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And we can grow in the knowledge of our
[1:19:33] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Because no
[1:19:35] true believer is spirit strong and
[1:19:38] spiritually healthy and alive as his
[1:19:40] knowledge of and adherence to the true
[1:19:43] word of God.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; I say, God, grow me in your word.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, this message didn't come just so
[1:19:49] we could hear enough of it to say, "Oh,
[1:19:51] yeah, that's the truth." and then lay it
[1:19:52] down and never read it again and move on
[1:19:54] and say, "Hey, God gave me discernment.
[1:19:56] Brother Beam's a prophet. Amen. This is
[1:19:58] the message." No. Let's grow in grace
[1:20:00] and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:02] Christ. And let the word of God give us
[1:20:04] discernment of everything in our lives.
[1:20:07] May the word of God help us to discern
[1:20:09] our own heart. May the word of God help
[1:20:10] discern everything that's going on
[1:20:12] around us. Discern the situations that
[1:20:14] are in the world. HOW ARE THEY
[1:20:16] DISCERNED? BY THE WORD.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:22] And then I want to finish with this
[1:20:23] scripture. Hebrews 5 11-14.
[1:20:27] Of whom we have many things to say and
[1:20:29] hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull
[1:20:31] of hearing. He was wanting to speak more
[1:20:33] of MelkiseDC.
[1:20:35] For when for the time you ought to be
[1:20:37] teachers, you have need that one teach
[1:20:40] you again, which be the first principles
[1:20:41] of the oracles of God. So he says, I'd
[1:20:45] like to say more about Melzdc, but
[1:20:47] you're not ready. You're too immature.
[1:20:50] But aren't you glad we've come to a day
[1:20:52] where somebody told us the rest of what
[1:20:54] Paul didn't tell us about
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; MelzDC.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It must be the season for full maturity.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Or else he wouldn't be telling us the
[1:21:01] rest of what Paul didn't tell us about
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to read verse 12 again.
[1:21:11] For when the time you ought to be
[1:21:12] teachers, you have need that one teach
[1:21:15] you again, which be the first principles
[1:21:16] of the oracles of God, or to become such
[1:21:18] as have need of milk, and not strong
[1:21:20] meat. For everyone that useth milk is
[1:21:23] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[1:21:25] for he is a babe. But strong meat
[1:21:28] belongth to them that are of full age,
[1:21:31] even those who by reason of use have
[1:21:34] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:21:37] good and evil.
[1:21:40] What will the strong meat do? The strong
[1:21:43] meat
[1:21:46] will give you by reason of use of what?
[1:21:49] The meat. The word. Have your senses
[1:21:52] exercise to discern both good and evil.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; That means if I keep eating this strong
[1:21:57] meat, by my exercise in the strong meat,
[1:22:01] it's going to sharpen and hone my
[1:22:03] discernment where I can discern good and
[1:22:04] evil.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I believe God has given us discernment
[1:22:08] by his grace. I believe God has given us
[1:22:10] discernment by his word and God has
[1:22:11] given us the pure word
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; so that we can grow in grace and in the
[1:22:16] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:22:18] God has given us discernment by his word
[1:22:20] and it works by his word and by his
[1:22:22] spiritual anointing anointing the word
[1:22:24] that we've received to give us eyes to
[1:22:26] see and ears to hear and a discernment
[1:22:28] of what's going on around us.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Right? To discern is to perceive
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; or to recognize.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, I recognize this. It's
[1:22:38] in the scriptures.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you next time you fall into
[1:22:43] trouble and and something happens and
[1:22:44] and LIKE CHAOS BREAKS OUT in in your
[1:22:47] life and you you know you walked into
[1:22:49] another trial and everything goes
[1:22:50] topsyturvy AND GO UPSIDE DOWN ALL THE
[1:22:53] SUDDEN IF WE'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE in the
[1:22:55] word if if our if our reasoning is
[1:22:57] exercised by use of the strong meat all
[1:23:00] of a sudden IT'S SAYING SAYING GOD WHY
[1:23:01] HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME? WHAT'S GOING ON IN
[1:23:03] MY LIFE? ALL OF A SUDDEN, SPIRITUAL
[1:23:05] SERMON SAYS IT SAYS, "OH, THIS IS WHAT
[1:23:07] THE SCRIPTURE SAYS." AND THINK IT NOT A
[1:23:09] STRANGE THING when you fall into diverse
[1:23:11] temptations. Hey, this is working for
[1:23:14] me. Patience and patience is BRINGING ME
[1:23:15] TO PERFECTION. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
[1:23:18] WORD SAYS will happen to a believer,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And you see how discernment works by the
[1:23:25] word. And all of a sudden, the word
[1:23:26] discerns the situation. And all of a
[1:23:29] sudden, I'm not feeling outcast from
[1:23:31] God's economy and thrown away. and he
[1:23:33] doesn't love me and he doesn't know me
[1:23:34] and he's mad at me and he's punishing me
[1:23:36] and all these other nonsense things. Why
[1:23:38] would God do that to a child of God?
[1:23:40] What he's doing is what he promised TO
[1:23:42] DO. HE'S PERFECTING US. AMEN. Through
[1:23:44] the fiery trials, amen, through the
[1:23:46] temptations, he's proving us and he's
[1:23:47] showing what's inside.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; And as we mature on the strong meat of
[1:23:54] this word, it brings discernment to
[1:23:56] every situation in our lives to where
[1:23:58] all of a sudden, AMEN, WE'RE NOT TOSSED
[1:24:00] ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE. NOT
[1:24:02] TOSSED BY EVERY TRIAL THAT comes along,
[1:24:04] but all of a sudden there's a steadiness
[1:24:05] that settles in and say, "Listen, amen.
[1:24:07] This is exactly ACCORDING TO THE WORD. I
[1:24:10] RECOGNIZE this by the word because this
[1:24:12] is what Peter said. THIS IS WHAT PAUL
[1:24:13] SAID. THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:24:15] WAS GOING to happen."
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And now my life is not in chaos. My life
[1:24:20] is perfectly in order because God said
[1:24:22] it would be
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; because he knows the way I take. And the
[1:24:26] footsteps of the righteous are order of
[1:24:27] the Lord. And God knows the end from the
[1:24:30] beginning. Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And now I can discern where I'm at by
[1:24:33] the word.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Where am I? I'm in a trial.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; For perfection,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; for purification of gold, for the
[1:24:43] proving of God's word.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] Amen. not little children anymore, but
[1:24:50] growing in discernment by the revelation
[1:24:53] of the word, by feeding on the word, by
[1:24:55] receiving the word, by the word,
[1:24:58] anointed by the spirit of God, bringing
[1:24:59] us into discernment of everything around
[1:25:02] us.
[1:25:04] There was a time that Paul, I think it
[1:25:06] was he was talking to Timothy, I think.
[1:25:09] Anyways, he was writing in one of his
[1:25:10] epistles how he was in prison and he
[1:25:14] said he was in prison and and and and
[1:25:16] everybody had left him. He says, "But
[1:25:19] I'm paraphrasing in case you couldn't
[1:25:22] tell,
[1:25:23] but it's a good thing
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; because my bonds have given more courage
[1:25:28] to them to preach the gospel more
[1:25:30] boldly."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] What was that? That was a man who could
[1:25:34] discern a situation.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; That was a man who didn't slip into
[1:25:38] despair because of the happenings to
[1:25:40] him. That was a man who could take the
[1:25:42] word of God and say, "The promises of
[1:25:44] God are still true. Everything he said
[1:25:46] about me is true. What he's called me to
[1:25:48] is still true. If God's allowed this to
[1:25:50] happen, then it's a good thing."
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And he was growing in his spiritual
[1:25:55] discernment by the word. And friends,
[1:25:57] that's a gift of God. And God has given
[1:26:00] him us his word as a gift and he's given
[1:26:02] his spirit as a gift. Let's keep feeding
[1:26:05] on the strong meat of the word.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; In Paul's day, they needed milk because
[1:26:11] they weren't ready to hear about
[1:26:12] MelkiseDC.
[1:26:13] That's
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; But if we're ready to hear about
[1:26:15] MelkiseDC, this must be a meat age.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's eat the strong meat of
[1:26:22] the word. And let the word discern us.
[1:26:25] Discern situations, discern our lives,
[1:26:28] and let's not let the devil interpret to
[1:26:31] us what's going on, but let's have
[1:26:34] discernment by the faith of God.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, if brother Benham said, "Your
[1:26:40] eternal destination does not entirely
[1:26:43] rest upon what you hear and see,"
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; that means you need to hear and see the
[1:26:48] word. Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not entirely, because you do
[1:26:52] need to hear and see it, but based off
[1:26:55] your discernment of what you hear and
[1:26:57] see."
[1:26:59] If that's true for our eternal
[1:27:01] destination,
[1:27:02] I believe it's true for every day of our
[1:27:04] lives and every situation we face. Our
[1:27:08] success and our walk in this world is
[1:27:10] not just necessarily based on what we've
[1:27:13] heard and seen or what's going on all
[1:27:15] around us, but our discernment of what's
[1:27:18] going on all around us.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; What is it that keeps us from going up
[1:27:23] and down and up and down and I'm a bride
[1:27:26] and no I'm not. I'm a bride and no I'm
[1:27:28] not. I'm a bride. No, I'm not.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Discernment.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] that when life goes up, I know what the
[1:27:37] word says about me. When life goes down,
[1:27:39] I know what the word says about me.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; What brings stability? Discernment of
[1:27:44] the word. Amen. What what what brings uh
[1:27:46] peace in our hearts? Discernment of the
[1:27:48] word. What gives us the ability to
[1:27:49] discern the situations in our life? The
[1:27:51] word of God.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; The anointing that he's brought in this
[1:27:55] age on his word in our lives. Amen. That
[1:27:57] word is starting to change our focus and
[1:27:59] change our vision. And we're behaving
[1:28:01] not not not letting the devil interpret
[1:28:03] the situations to us and not letting the
[1:28:05] world interpret the situation and not
[1:28:07] letting another human being interpret
[1:28:08] the situations to us.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Some human being will come along just
[1:28:12] like Job's friends and say, "You know
[1:28:13] why this is happening to you, don't
[1:28:14] you?"
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Ah, I never realized you're
[1:28:18] God's replacement."
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad to meet you now. The one
[1:28:23] who knows everything about everybody in
[1:28:24] every circumstance.
[1:28:28] Listen, they show up in every trial.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; But now,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; listen, somebody can say, "I know why
[1:28:37] this is happening to you because this,
[1:28:39] this, and this, and this is happening
[1:28:40] because of that. But I'm not looking for
[1:28:43] any of that." Now, what is the how does
[1:28:46] the word describe my situation?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; What did God say about where I'm at?
[1:28:51] What did God say about me? What did God
[1:28:53] say about this trial? What did God say
[1:28:54] about this? What what did God say? If I
[1:28:56] can find it in the word, then I can
[1:28:58] start to discern it. And that
[1:29:00] discernment of the word anointed by the
[1:29:02] spirit of God can cut
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; to the soul and the spirit and begin to
[1:29:07] divide the things that are so hard for
[1:29:09] me to divide, so confusing, so
[1:29:12] mysterious in my mind. But if I can take
[1:29:14] and find the word and begin to apply the
[1:29:16] word by the grace of God to the
[1:29:18] situation, the word will begin to
[1:29:20] discern the situation and expose the
[1:29:22] hiding place of the devil and put me
[1:29:24] back in my right position.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; I believe what we need is discernment
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; of what's going on in our lives every
[1:29:33] day.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; How are we going to get it? By grace.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; By revelation, by the spirit of God, and
[1:29:39] by the word of God.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what do I say to you? What do
[1:29:43] I need to do, Brother Chad? What is it?
[1:29:45] I need more discernment. I just keep
[1:29:47] reading.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Keep listening. Keep feeding. Keep
[1:29:51] taking in the word. Keep praying for
[1:29:53] revelation. Keep asking God for more of
[1:29:55] his spirit in your life. A deeper
[1:29:57] relationship and a greater revelation of
[1:30:00] this message of the scriptures and that
[1:30:02] the word will discern
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; the situations in our life.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what's our discernment? I want
[1:30:10] to start asking the question now when
[1:30:12] somebody calls me up or comes to me and
[1:30:14] says, "My whole world's falling apart.
[1:30:15] Everything's upside down and
[1:30:17] everything's gone wrong." You know what
[1:30:18] my next question will be? It probably
[1:30:20] won't be. I'll probably say, "Oh, I'm
[1:30:21] sorry. I love you and I'm going to hear
[1:30:22] for you and all that." But at some
[1:30:24] point, I want to slip in. What is your
[1:30:27] discernment of what's happening to you
[1:30:29] right now?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Because if your discernment of what's
[1:30:33] happening to you right now is I must not
[1:30:37] please God, I must not be bride. this
[1:30:38] wouldn't be happening to me if I was a
[1:30:40] child of God. Your discernment is what's
[1:30:42] causing the problem.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; It's not the problem. It's your
[1:30:47] discernment of what's happening is where
[1:30:49] the real problem lies. Because if you
[1:30:51] could discern what the word says about
[1:30:52] you and what the word promised in every
[1:30:54] trial and what the word does to expose
[1:30:56] all of these trappings of the devil, if
[1:30:58] we could have that spiritual
[1:30:59] discernment, there wouldn't be a problem
[1:31:01] because the problem would come under our
[1:31:03] feet and we would keep moving on because
[1:31:05] we know that this is the will of God
[1:31:06] concerning me. So, I give thanks for it
[1:31:08] and I move forward.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; So, don't get your feelings hurt if I
[1:31:13] ask you that question. What is your
[1:31:14] discernment of what's happening to you
[1:31:16] right now?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Well, my discernment is everything's
[1:31:19] wrong and God forgot about me and
[1:31:24] that's why you're having problems.
[1:31:27] But you can have the worst day of your
[1:31:29] life and if your discernment is God
[1:31:31] hasn't forgot about me. I'm still a
[1:31:33] child of God. This is to working
[1:31:35] together for good. God meant it for my
[1:31:38] good and not for harm. So, I'm just
[1:31:39] going to keep believing the word and
[1:31:41] keep pressing forward. Guess what?
[1:31:42] You're going to have victory.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Every day of your life,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So, the question is is what is our
[1:31:48] discernment? What is our discernment
[1:31:50] about the word? I hope God's answered
[1:31:52] that for most of us. But what's our
[1:31:54] discernment about the word every day
[1:31:57] unfolding in our lives
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and the situations all around us? I say,
[1:32:02] let's pray for more revelation.
[1:32:05] Let's all stand. Musicians, if you'll
[1:32:08] come please. And brother John, we're
[1:32:10] never going to be spiritually strong and
[1:32:12] healthy
[1:32:14] as our knowledge of
[1:32:16] and adherence to the true word of God.
[1:32:20] How many believe we receive the true
[1:32:21] word of God in this day?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; So, you've got what it takes. Who
[1:32:25] believes it's the strong meat?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Then let's eat it, friends.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And be exercised by to discern good and
[1:32:32] evil.
[1:32:34] The world's got to a place where it
[1:32:36] calls good evil and evil good.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; But the word of God cuts through all of
[1:32:40] that mess and calls evil evil and good
[1:32:42] good.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And I think the word of God is going to
[1:32:46] get to the place where it stops calling
[1:32:47] our trials evil and starts calling them
[1:32:49] good.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Is that what the word says?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Not the bad things that happen, but the
[1:32:59] result of what God brings in our life is
[1:33:02] good. and it's for good and it'll work
[1:33:05] together for good and it'll bring about
[1:33:07] good and he's allowed it because he's
[1:33:09] good.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; May God discern our lives. Amen. Let's
[1:33:13] bow our heads together. Lord, thank you
[1:33:16] for this word. And Lord, I pray that you
[1:33:18] would just hone in our discernment
[1:33:20] according to the revelation of your
[1:33:22] word. May you reveal it to us in a
[1:33:25] deeper way, a more personal way, a way
[1:33:28] that makes the word so real every day.
[1:33:30] Not what I heard on Sunday, not what I
[1:33:32] heard preached on Wednesday, but when I
[1:33:34] wake up Monday morning and face my first
[1:33:36] trouble, may that word be a living
[1:33:38] reality at that moment. Lord, may you do
[1:33:41] it for every one of my brothers and
[1:33:42] sisters and for myself included. May you
[1:33:45] give us a greater discernment, Lord, a
[1:33:47] greater revelation of of the hour we
[1:33:49] live in, the the the forces that we're
[1:33:51] facing and the word that's being made
[1:33:53] manifest.
[1:33:55] God, I pray if there's any here that
[1:33:56] don't have a genuine revelation and
[1:33:59] discernment of what this message is, may
[1:34:02] you grant it to them now, Lord. God, for
[1:34:05] we know there's nobody can work their
[1:34:07] way into it. Neither can we preach
[1:34:09] anybody into it. Neither can we force it
[1:34:11] upon people.
[1:34:13] But oh God, by your grace, your
[1:34:15] graciousness in our lives, would you
[1:34:17] just unlock the mystery in the hearts of
[1:34:19] your children?
[1:34:21] these young people who haven't yet
[1:34:23] received their own revelation, would
[1:34:25] your grace unlock it to them now.
[1:34:28] Anybody who's been around for a while
[1:34:30] but confused on things and uncertain and
[1:34:33] frightened, I pray God that your grace
[1:34:36] would go now to them and would you
[1:34:38] unlock the the mystery in their hearts
[1:34:40] and give them discernment of what this
[1:34:42] really is all about. And may you give
[1:34:45] them a personal connection with yourself
[1:34:47] and a revelation of who you are in this
[1:34:50] hour. And this day, today, who are you
[1:34:53] today?
[1:34:55] And God, the rest of us who've received
[1:34:57] that by grace, we are so thankful, Lord.
[1:35:01] But the devil's coming at us with every
[1:35:03] tactic, with every tool, with every
[1:35:06] weapon, with everything that he can. But
[1:35:09] God, we know by your word that no weapon
[1:35:12] formed against us shall prosper. For you
[1:35:15] have given us a measure of the word that
[1:35:17] has never struck the earth before. And
[1:35:20] we ask, Father, that you would just give
[1:35:21] us a greater revelation of that word.
[1:35:23] May you unlock it to our hearts. May you
[1:35:26] feed it to us, Lord, by your divine
[1:35:28] grace. May your spirit open our
[1:35:30] understanding to catch the revelation of
[1:35:32] the word for the hour we live and our
[1:35:34] place in that word. And God would
[1:35:36] through that, would you give us
[1:35:38] discernment to discern good and evil in
[1:35:40] every situation?
[1:35:42] God, we're asking for it, Lord, as we
[1:35:44] feed on your word. May you quicken it to
[1:35:46] us and make it alive in us more and more
[1:35:49] day by day. For we trust you. We love
[1:35:52] you. We know this is the source. We know
[1:35:53] you've opened the fountain to us. You we
[1:35:56] know that you're the lamb that we're
[1:35:57] feeding on. We know that this is the
[1:35:59] very truth that's going to carry us all
[1:36:01] the way to a body change and we're
[1:36:03] feeding on it in the name of Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ. God, would you come and reveal
[1:36:07] it to us like never before? We love you.
[1:36:11] We need discernment in the hour we live
[1:36:13] in. the darkest age, the darkest hour.
[1:36:15] When Satan's coming to his full power of
[1:36:18] deception, you have shined the brightest
[1:36:21] light to give us the greatest
[1:36:22] discernment, the greatest potential to
[1:36:25] discern and withstand. And we ask that
[1:36:28] you would unlock it to us by your grace
[1:36:31] in Jesus Christ's name. We love you. We
[1:36:34] thank you for this. May you bless your
[1:36:36] people as we go from here. May we go as
[1:36:39] bright and shining lights. May we walk
[1:36:42] forward with discernment. We ask it in
[1:36:44] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; give me more
[1:36:52] revelation.
[1:36:57] Let my life be all forsen.
[1:37:05] Let the word
[1:37:07] of God guide me on
[1:37:11] my way
[1:37:13] so he can have preeminence
[1:37:17] each day.
[1:37:21] Give me more
[1:37:24] revelation
[1:37:29] and let my life
[1:37:32] be your
[1:37:34] reflection.
[1:37:38] For I know that this word is my
[1:37:42] redemption.
[1:37:45] Give me more
[1:37:49] revelation.
[1:37:53] Give me more
[1:37:57] revelation
[1:38:01] and let my flesh
[1:38:04] be all
[1:38:06] forsaken.
[1:38:10] and the word
[1:38:12] of God guide me on
[1:38:16] my way
[1:38:18] so he can have every
[1:38:23] day.
[1:38:26] Give me more.
[1:38:34] Let my life
[1:38:36] be your
[1:38:39] reflection
[1:38:42] for I know
[1:38:45] this word is my redemption.
[1:38:49] Give me more
[1:38:53] revelation.
