TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Again, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Now, you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming, but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed. And all that's in the book would be him. For that's the believer. The word's in the book. And the word is him. Amen. So everything that's in this book is what? Christ. Yeah. Because Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Yeah. But what are you? Yeah, I'm one of the words in the book. So there's my name. I'm part of the book. But the book is Christ, which means I'm part of Christ. And Christ is the revelation, the mystery of God revealed. That means I'm part of God. I'm part of the revelation of God. I'm part of Christ. And Christ is the book. And the believer's words in the book. I'm part of the book, part of Christ. Part of the revelation of God's great mystery. The seventh seal. The seventh seal is not something I believe. The seventh seal is something I'm part of, manifesting, expressing on this earth. It's not a belief. It's a manifestation. It's not a belief. It's a person. It's God himself coming and manifesting himself through Christ through the anointing of Christ upon a people on the earth to manifest the bride form of Jesus Christ. It's not a doctrine. It's not a teaching. It's not a belief. It's a manifestation of a life. That's the seventh seal. Praise God. Now, does it matter if you lose your job tomorrow? It doesn't matter if you lose your job tomorrow. Will your flesh suffer? Sure, it will suffer. But what does it matter? I saw my name in the book. The book that's been from before the foundation of the world. Amen. What does it matter? Everything's secure. If something happens to me, it's only because God wants to express some of his word through me. This revelation is the revelation that gives the bride faith to take her position. Yeah. This is the revelation that will eventually give her faith to take a body change because she recognizes what she really is, what her substance is, what she's part of, and why she's here.
