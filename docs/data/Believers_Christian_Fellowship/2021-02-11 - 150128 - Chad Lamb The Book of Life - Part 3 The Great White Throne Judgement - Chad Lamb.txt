========================================

for us a week from today so make sure you take note of that as well praise the lord let's go to saint john chapter 5 and verse 28. jesus is speaking here says marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice now this this all that are in the grave shall hear his voice is not speaking of the rapture of the church right because of the rapture of the church all that are in the graves do not hear his voice but only those that are dead in christ shall arise okay so he's speaking here of all the dead all that are in the graves read it again marvel not this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grape shall hear his voice and shall come forth so what he's talking about is the general resurrection of the dead that will take place after the millennial reign all right it shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation that's not the first resurrection that's the second resurrection then everybody who comes in the second resurrection must go to judgment some unto life and some into damnation all right let's pray the heavenly father we ask that you bless the reading of your word let your anointing lord be upon the servant i pray god that you would speak here that you would have free reign in this assembly tonight lord that we will all have ears to hear and we would all have hearts to perceive all that you choose to speak to us this evening we ask your blessings in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated and as you're seated let's flip over to revelations chapter 20. and uh hopefully you brought your church age books back i didn't say that specifically i should have made a specific announcement but i'll be reading quite a bit out of the book and i also have an overhead slide we can go ahead and bring the powerpoint up so the references that i'm going to read i wrote down the references on the overheads so if you didn't bring your book you can just jot them down and you can go home and look at those then we're going to talk about the book of life and we're going to talk about the great white throne judgment today revelations chapter 20 let's read from verse 11. and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life so there's going to be books not just one book but at this judgment there's going to be multiple books there's going to be books and another book which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books so the book of life does not contain all the deeds that were done the book of life only contains names but the rest of the books are in the rest of the books contain the record of what you did in your life of the basis for the judgment okay but the book of life is just a book of names all that's in the book of life is a record of names that's why there's multiple books but then it says according to their works now that's interesting that this judgment is a judgment based on works it's not a judgment based on faith right because those who have faith believe unto righteousness because they believe the word of the lord and because they believe the word of the lord just like when abraham believed that the world word of the lord it was imputed unto him for righteousness and so these are not judged based off faith this judgment is a judgment based on works let's read on a little bit and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered of the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works hold your finger right there and flip with me over to ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works okay we are not saved by works you are saved by grace through faith and that not of yourself that is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast so he's very clearly saying that our faith or our grace that is given to us to the believer to those that are in christ to those that come to the first resurrection or those that are dead in christ and those that are alive in christ will be gathered together to meet him in the air they are saved by grace through faith not of works lest any man should boast all right but over here in the judgment we see that they are being judged according to their works it's different groups right cannot be the same group let's go over to romans chapter four together romans chapter 4 and verse 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father has pertained to the flesh hath found as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath were of to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt so he's saying that he believed in his reward was for faith so go over to chapter five romans chapter five when we read verse one therefore being justified by faith so how are you justified or declared just just as if you had never sinned before you're justified by faith not by works justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith unto his grace how do we get to his grace by faith faith is a free gift of god not of ourselves but is the gift of god not of works works does not produce faith works does not give us faith and worse does not give us access to grace but we're justified by faith and by faith we're given access to his grace and if by faith you've received access to his grace then you you become part of christ you get baptized into the body of christ by one spirit we are all baptized into one body then we are now passed from death and the life we are in christ jesus and now when christ comes to call his elect we go because we're in christ amen because we've been justified by faith by whom also we have access verse two again by faith into the grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope and glory of god so that is how the believer comes into this grace is by faith this is how the elect the children of god come into this justification is by faith so we've already been justified and how have we already been justified we've already been justified because we're in christ christ was nailed to a cross bearing the reproach and shame and sin on our behalf and so now our sin is part of christ and when christ died in the flesh he died and he he bore our shame he took our punishment and now we are justified by faith in christ right and if we're in christ now it means we were in christ then because you cannot get into christ unless you were always a part of christ because christ is more than jesus christ is the anointed word christ was that rock that followed moses through the wilderness that was not jesus that was christ the anointed word and now by faith in christ the anointed word we become we are part of him signifying that we were part of him before we've always been part of him so when he was nailed to the cross we were part of them that's why we'll not stand the judgment because we've already been judged when were we judged in christ and god cannot judge us twice and that's why when we have faith into christ we have faith that faith links us to that punishment on the cross and there's no more there's no more sacrifice for sin for us right and it's all by faith that we receive that grace but this judgment is not the same those who come up in this judgment are not in the same place we know they're not in christ or they would have come in the first resurrection they wouldn't be in the second resurrection we know that they don't have faith that that gets some justification we know that they don't have faith that gives them access to grace or else they would have come in the first resurrection but because in their second resurrection they're not in that same category all right are we on the same page all right let's keep working through this in verse 13 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so we want to look at this white throne judgment and take a look at the book of life again so we the subject was the book of life and the book of life we find out is very important in the white throne judgment because if your name is not written in that book of life at the time of the white throne judgment then you're cast into the lake of fire so we want to see what this book of life is now brother branham tells us in the analogy that we read last week in the church age book that this book of life is the record of the wheat plant but not all the wheat plant a seed some of it was a support system that carried the life as the life came through to reproduce the grain again in the head and not the whole plant is seed not the whole plant plant is bride not the whole plant is the elect but the whole plant is recorded in the book of life okay it's also called the lamb's book of life it's also called thy book the book of life of the lamb the record of the righteous but brother ben says there's two sections to this book this book is is one book but there's two sections and this section of the book which is a small portion of the book is the section of the book of life this is what has eternal life that which was in christ in the beginning that which is in christ now section of the book of life brother branham when he's preaching more often than not calls this the lamb's book of life but not 100 of the time you have to be careful when you're reading the message because he he refers more often than not when he's talking about the lamb's book of life he's talking about this section of the book of life that has to do with the eternal it's the record of the seed part of the plant so if the book of life is the record of the entire plant this section of the book of life or the lamb's book of life is the record of the seed portion of this plant it's the record of eternal life and it's the names of the elected that's the seed portion it's also the bride the word those that rule are ruling and reigning with christ for a thousand years if you're not on the seed portion of this you won't be in the millennium ruling and reigning with christ for a thousand years and it's also the judges of the world because this is the record of eternal life this is the record of christ this is the record of the word coming forth in each generation this is what judges the world this royal seed portion of the book we'll look at that and see that clearly here shortly revelations 20 4 and 6 and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them so he he sees thrones and he sees people sit on the thrones and he sees judgment given to the people who are sitting on the thrones meaning that they are going to pass judgment so he goes on to describe this group and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witnesses of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years so which group is he talking about this is the seed portion of the book this is the elect this is the bride this is who he's talking about but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so we're clear on who we're talking about verse six blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so this is the first resurrection this is this is the record or the account of the first resurrection that were seated on thrones and judgment is given to them let's grab our church age book if you have it and we'll turn to page 276. 276 chapter 1 we're going to start with the very first sentence in 276. these righteous will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in judgment first corinthians 6 2 3 says do you do you not know that the saints shall judge the world and the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and overcame and am set down with my father in his throne see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the judgment with him that is exactly what daniel saw daniel chapter 7 verse 9 and 10. i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame in his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open see it is the same scene for the thousand thousands who are ministering to him are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife so there's thousand thousands which he said to the bride are ministering to the lamb sitting on the throne but before the lamb is the ten thousand times ten thousand that are before him and this is the setting of the judgment he's saying this is the judgment this is the scene of the white throne judgment but the bride is not before him in the judgment the bride is sitting with him ministering to him in the judgment let's turn to daniel chapter 7 together daniel chapter 7. that's where we just read from out of the church age book was verse 9 and 10 but if we jump over to verse 22 daniel chapter 7 verse 22 says until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom this is the same thing that we read in revelations we just read in revelations 20 4 and 6 that i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them that was those who came up in the first resurrection and here he says the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints because the saints shall judge the world know you not that ye shall judge the world. hallelujah it's all saying the same thing let's go on so in the book of life you have this small portion of the book of life is the record of the seed and this larger person of the book of life is the record of the plant and the the plant is necessary to make the seed right the plant's there you've got to have photosynthesis you've got to have a stalk that holds it up so it doesn't rot you have to have this support system to bring forth life so you have the seed portion you have the plant portion and the plant portion is necessary this plant portion is called the wheat plant and it's the righteous at the judgment so those that are declared righteous at the judgment are part of this plant in the seed portion of this book names cannot be removed why because if you're in christ now then you had to have representation in christ before the foundation of the world and that which is in christ can't be lost you can't be in christ one day and out of christ the next day you can't be part of the word then not part of the word the next day it doesn't work that way if you were ever part of christ you were always part of christ amen so that part names cannot be removed but in the regular part of the book of life or the plant portion names can be removed it's possible to have names removed and we'll look at this let's go to exodus together we're going to read these three portions of scripture together exodus 32 in exodus 32 30 we find that this is the children of israel in the exodus journey they're coming out and this is when they made themselves golden calf a golden calf and they begin to worship at it and this is how moses responds and this is what the lord says exodus 32 30 and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord per adventure i shall make an atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said all this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou has written what book is he talking about he's not talking about books plural he's talking about book one book and this is the book of life and he's saying if you cannot forgive them then blot my name out instead out of your book here's god's response 33 and the lord said unto moses whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book see it's possible to have names blotted out of the book of life out of god's book all right and he says him that sinned against me will i block let's go to oh let's read thirty four therefore now go lead the people into the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them so god god is keeping records he's keeping good records let's go over to psalm 69. in psalm 69 we have a psalm that's recording the death of jesus christ and and this is about christ on the cross so we're going to start reading in verse 21 psalm 69 verse 21 they gave me also golf from my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that they which and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap that their eyes be dark and that they see not and make their loins continually to shake pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell there in their tents for they persecuted him whom thou hast mentioned and they talked to the grief of those whom now has wounded and add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous here's another group that had their name blotted off of the book of life and want for for persecuting jesus christ for persecuting jesus christ they had their names removed blotted out the book of life and i just want to add here that anybody every time that you reject christ and whatever force form christ comes in then you have rejected god and that is when you become eligible to have your name blotted off of the book of life you've sinned against god let's go to revelations chapter 3. revelations chapter 3 verse 4 and 5. thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments how many names was it a big bunch of names just a few names and all that church age and sardis there's just a few names that have not defiled their garments that was the few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life if you walk with the lord you will not have your name blotted out of the book of life praise the lord it's a great consolation let's go back to the church age book and we'll read 267 page 267 the last paragraph paragraph two now where is this book located he's talking about the book of life where is this book located luke 10 17 and 24 says and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto undust through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the putin and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who is the father but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them the book of life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white throne judgment in these verses jesus said that their names were written in heaven they were written in the book of life for that is where names are placed jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was also speaking to the 12 in verse 23 these had all been rejoicing that devils were subject to them in jesus name christ's rejoinder was rejoice not that spirits are subject to you but rather that your names are written in heaven book of life you will note here that judas was one of those who were casting out devils in jesus name but we know that he was a devil the son of perdition john 6 17 71 says jesus answered them have not i chosen the twelve and one of you as a devil he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve john 17 12 while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled john 13 10 to 11 and verse 18 jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean i speak not of you all and i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now if language means anything at all we must admit that judas was chosen by jesus john 13 18. yet he was not clean john 13 10-11 judas was also given to jesus by the father john 17 12. let it be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of moses and pharaoh jacob and esau for though esau and pharaoh were both foreknown they were predestinated to wrath while the end of moses and jacob was glorification first peter 2 8 9 shows both reprobates and even and elect both shows both reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to pentecost acts 1 16-17 reads men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained had obtained part of this ministry the part that judas obtained amongst the twelve and that and then lost was neither inferior to the ministries of the other eleven nor was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others acts 1 25 that he may take part of this ministry an apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even in the book of life but his name was blotted out judas was with the lord judas ate the last supper with the lord judas cast out devils in the name of the lord judas was part of the inner sanctum of the inner sanctum of of the of the disciples of jesus christ but yet judas was a devil from the beginning even having his name on the book of life because he was part of that plant part of the wheat plant he was part of the church and he had his name on that book but because he rejected christ and he fought against the word in that day his name was taken out of that book let's turn to 272 272 the last chapter chapter 3. not chapter paragraph sorry now i'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in the book of life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true god and worship of him though they did not worship according to truth word now just think about that those that we talked about in exodus that were in the exodus journey were they part of the religious order of that day were they part of the move of god for that day were they part of the move of christ in that day they absolutely were they were part of the religious system of the day they were part they were right where christ was working in that day in the exodus journey with moses a prophet with a pillar of fire with all the signs but just as soon as they rejected the word and they they went into idolatry just the minute that they deviated worship away from god and worshiped in something false their names were blotted out of the book they were part of the church they were there they were worshiping they were doing it all they walked through the red sea they put the blood on the lent on the doorpost they did it all but there come a time when they rejected the truth they rejected the word and went into error when they went into error their name was blotted off of the book same thing happened with judas like judas they didn't go all the way see how judas was chosen of god he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost judas failed multitudes fail right there and then they failed to go on in that word their names are taken off of the book of life all right now this record of the plant there's many categories or different groups that fall unto this record in the book of life the first one that we want to look at is those who are good to the brethren those good to the brethren matthew 25 let's just read this in our bibles matthew 25 verse 31 this is the parable of the separating of the sheep and the goats and the bible and its judgment and this is the white throne judgment and it's a white throne judgment and jesus is telling it in a parable here matthew 25 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from his goats from the goats now it's important if you look at your bible here when it says divideth his sheep from the goats is his written in that talent is it italicized okay if it's italicized that means the the translators of the bible added that word to help with the understanding to make it easier it's not part of the original translation okay and this is important here because they interjected this to make it read like english would read not like greek would read but in their injecting of this is wrong because these are not his sheep we know his sheep are gathered into the into the fold already it's as a shepherd separating sheep and goats these are not his sheep right this is something that the the translators in the king james version added in it's not part of the original greek the original just greek just says as a shepherd separated sheep from goats let's read that again and i'm going to skip the italicized word verse 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was a hunger and then you gave me no meat gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saul we thee a hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the in or naked and clothed thee our wind saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you and so much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me so here the scene is set he's separating it says all nations not just some not just a few all nations this is the white throne judgment and he's separating the righteous from the unrighteous in this judgment and he's placing one on the right hand and one on the left and he starts telling them you're over here because you fed me you clothed me you took me in you visited me you did all these things to me and they didn't even know when they did it when lord did we do this to you we had no idea because they did not recognize the body of the lord they did not recognize what they were doing the same way paul when paul was persecuting the christians he was on the road to damascus and he was struck down by a bright light and that bright light says saul saul why does thou persecute me and he says who are you who am i persecuting i'm persecuting these false doctrine of christians yeah i'm hauling them in the jail and i'm having them stoned and i'm doing all this but who are you and he knows this is the lord because it's the pillar of fire and the lord said i am jesus whom you persecute why because the the body of christ was the church the the the elect seed of that day was the body of christ and whatever you did to them you did to jesus right so if you fed them and you clothed them and you took them in and you visited them and and you did all these things for them you did it to the lord okay that's what he's saying in the judgment but he said they said when did we do this when did we we didn't see you we you weren't around you weren't sick and we never fed you we never did any of this and he said when you did it to the least and these mine brethren so who is he talking to these my brethren he's not it's not those that are before his throne it's not like you sheep did it to each other right it wasn't because this sheep was good to that sheep no he said you did it when you did it to the least of these that are seated with him on the throne when he did the least of these my brother the joint heirs in christ the first born among many brethren the first resurrected from the dead that was going to be the the first of many brethren that would resurrect from the dead all of them being brethren by what new birth in christ these are the brethren the brethren are not before him the brethren are seated with him on his throne they're the thousand times thousand that came to minister unto him they're the ones whom judgment was given to the saints they're the ones who are sitting on the thrones and he said when you did it to these mine brethren you did it to me hallelujah that's where i want to be sitting at white throne judgment i don't know about you but i don't want to be facing him i want to be sitting beside him amen thank god for that mercy let's continue to read 41 then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed unto everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was a hunger and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they answer him saying lord when saw we thee a or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto these they're saying the same thing same question if i'm going to be condemned into hell i want to know why lord when did you come to us and we didn't take you in when were you here and he says the exact same thing then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me who are the least of these the brethren where who are the brethren the joint heirs amen one of the least of these he did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal now this is important they don't have eternal life the same way the bride has eternal life because if you have eternal life like we talked about sunday you cannot die these are the resurrection of the dead we were the resurrection of the dead in christ or those that sleep in the ground because we already hath we already have possessed eternal life because we're the record of the seed and the seed has life within it the plant doesn't have life within it but the seed has life within it this is the record of the word this is the record of christ this is the record of that which can never be blotted out can never pass away this is the record of the brethren hallelujah so we already have we don't have to come into eternal life we already have eternal life but this group does not already have eternal life but they are allowed to come into everlasting life there's a big difference between having life which is zoe life which is a portion that came from god which you possess already right because we have representation from before the foundation of the world where in christ where in god and because it was before the foundation of the world it was before time our life goes back to before time and if it was before time then it's everlasting then it's eternal then it's zoe life and that life was designated to come out in certain ages and in certain times and through certain vessels and it just happened to pop up in you and i but because that life came before time it is not subject to time it cannot die it is eternal life and we already have it but there is a portion of people that are going to let be allowed to come into eternal life meaning after the white throne judgment there is time no more after millennium that ends all time there's no more counting of days there's no more seasons and no more seconds there's no more watch there's no more time and if you have any life beyond time what kind of life is that eternal life not because you always had it from before the foundation of the world but because you were allowed to come into it right after the white throne judgment you're allowed to come into everlasting life hallelujah it says and those shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into they go away into because they go beyond the white throne judgment into new heavens and new earth and so they go into life eternal all right let's keep moving let's look at page 277 in the church book 277 paragraph two we now face the question as to why they should be given eternal life at the judgment since the epistles seem to exclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of christ or perish that's a very important statement how is it that they're allowed to come into eternal life when the epistles when the scriptures make it very clear that the path to eternal life or the being sealed until the day of redemption is to have the spirit of christ or to be baptized in the spirit or be concealed by the holy ghost so how are these allowed to come into eternal life not having been sealed with the holy ghost they must possess the spirit of christ or perish though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general resurrection or after it paul does not evade this truth for most clearly he says in philippians 3 11 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we all we are all going to be in the resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so paul could hardly be saying if by any means i might attain to a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he's not saying that the literal reading is if by any means i might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the attaining to the general or second resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection of which it said blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of the thousand years when all the rest of the dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who in the second resurrection or given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast into the lake of fire will be so treated because their treatment of the brethren since this is the word of god we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact to further clarify notice specifically the words of matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd divided sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white throne judgment the sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they are not his brethren that would make them joint heirs with jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share no throne etc with them their names must have been in the book of life and not removed now because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of god perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they stood for the children in a time of trouble amen that is mercy that is what mercy looks like there's a whole group of people that are going to be given entrance into the kingdom they're going to come into eternal life beyond time why because they were part of the support system helping the seed come forth that in a time of trouble they stood for the seed in a time of trouble they helped christ christ too christ and you and i and if they do not reject that life if do they not speak against that life if do they not if they don't fight against that life or call it beelzebub or call it an evil spirit or call to the man-made religion if they don't say any nasty degrading things about it then their name will not be blotted off of the book of life but no matter how many times they help and uh aid and support the life if they begin to reject that same life wherever that life is found whether it be in you whether it be in me whether it be in brother branham whether it be in any other seed of god if they begin to reject that word they begin to reject that life then their name will be blotted off of the book of life unless your name is recorded in the seed part of the book of life that can never be blotted off you could be like saul who became the apostle paul you can hate it you can fight against it you can breathe vehement words against it but god will turn you around why because your name can't be blotted off the book hallelujah hey amen if it's the case that anybody who ever speaks against the message their name would be blotted off the book of life my name would have been bought it off the book of life because i didn't always say nice things about the message when i first saw it but because i had the same thing in me that the apostle paul had laying in him when he was persecuting the church god had to come down and reveal this message to me personally because i was part of that record of eternal life that could not be blotted out because it could not be blotted out he had to open my eyes paul said i did it i persecuted church but i did it ignorantly right he didn't know that this was the church of god he didn't know that this was christ and so because he did it ignorantly not knowing what it was being part of the seed life being part of eternal life being part of christ he was forgiven for that and god opened his eyes and he was able to repent but there are those who are not part of that record that do it ignorantly also but they will not be excused for persecuting christ ignorantly the pharisees did it many of them did it ignorantly those that were shouting at the judgment seat of pilate they were saying away with him crucify him give us barabbas most of them were doing it ignorantly but if they were not on the record of eternal life if they were not the seed portion of the lamb's book of life they are not given repentance for that their name is blotted off of the lamb's book of life what changes all the rules the election of god changes all the rules who can get away with murder the elect they have david did who's the favorite children the elect they can get away with murder they can get away with blasphemy the unpardonable sin paul was committing that how could paul get away from blasphemy but for anybody else who blasphemes it's the impartable sin because paul was part of christ because he was part of christ when christ went to calvary he already bled and died for paul's blasphemy amen praise god i love this revelation some people hate this revelation they get so mad when you talk about this and it makes me wonder what part of the book do you see yourself in if you're so angry about this what part of the book are you in because if i'm in the park of the record of eternal life or the seed coming forth the part of christ the bride i love this revelation i love this word i i can't be stupid enough to get myself out of it i can't be so ignorant or so vile or so messed up that i'm somehow going to miss the rapture it's an impossibility because i was in christ when he was hanging on the cross hallelujah i love this amen all right mark 9 41 says for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward why because he was a great christian because he did great sacrifices because he went to church every sunday because he gave a cup of cold water matthew 10 42 and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward what if your neighbor mows your grass for you while you're sick what if somebody helps you out of a ditch what's going to happen if they do not reject the word they will not lose their reward if they do not reject the word of god they will not lose their reward 1956 brother preaches elisha the prophet and so this woman had seen god and elijah and she said i think it's nice now if we do something for this servant of god god will respect it why she was just a few hundred years ahead of time jesus said if you give one of my disciples a cup of cold water at the judgment it won't be forgotten we fail to see the power that god has placed in his people the power of what the power to pardon sins these people are aren't righteous they are not they are not living for christ they are not con have a confession of christ they are treating the brethren good and what's happening they are receiving a pardon for their sins and allowed to come into eternal life why because we're not just people we're not just what you see in the mirror there's more to us than what the eye beholds because if we came from christ and we're going back to christ then that means we are christ the anointed word for the hour and how you treat the word how you treat christ amen is what will be brought up on the day of judgment at the great white throne judgment not how many nice deeds you did and how many cups of coffee you gave but how you treated the word and the form that the word came in which was the brethren hallelujah we fail to see the power that god has placed in his people god is in his people you believe that god was with his people one time when he walked on the earth but now god is in his people a little while the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for i personal pronoun will be with you with and in you to the end of the world who's in you christ is in you that's why it matters that's why it matters that somebody visits you feeds you cares for you why because it's christ amen the book of life the plant we have those that were good to the brethren that are part of this book of life and the souls that are under the altar and the fifth seal the jews so let's take a quick look at this revelations chapter 6 verse 9 to 11 and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held now if you recognize it's not the testimony of jesus christ it is for the word of god and the testimony that they held these are jews and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled church age book 273. i'm going to skip a little bit because we've already read this okay in the first paragraph on 274 right past the italicized sentence that said let them be blotted out of the book of the living we're going to start at the next sentence when the jews rejected jesus there was a literal turning away of god from them to the gentiles acts 13 46-48 then paul and barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you what was spoken to them what was paul and barnabas speaking to the jews the word of god not they weren't quoting out of the torah they were bringing the revelation of what was written in the torah of jesus christ slain and they were preaching to them what to them looked like a new doctrine well to them looked like something outside of the word that was given to them but paul being a prophet could come down and paul and barnabas being apostles could come down and begin to share what they had what they knew and to the jews it looked like extra scriptures but paul said it's the word of god he said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life how did they judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life they rejected the word of god what word of god they reject they rejected the word of god that paul and barnabas was preaching they were not rejecting what was written in the scroll what they had been repeating since they were a child what they had learned in the bible verse they weren't knowingly rejecting that even though they were because that was a foreshadow of things to come but the thing is they didn't know they were rejecting the word of god right because they were reading the torah they were reading the manuscripts they were reading those things and quoting those verses and preaching from those but something came that was not according to their customs something came that they were not used to hearing and when it came from a man they thought the problem was with paul and they thought they were rejecting paul but they were not rejecting paul and they were not rejecting barnabas they were rejecting god because they were rejecting the word of god and when they rejected the word of god that they deemed themselves unworthy of everlasting life what would have made them worthy of everlasting life receiving the word of god not works not deeds not all these things like jumping through hoops but receiving and believing in the word of god would have made them worthy of everlasting life aren't you glad it's that easy all right because you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should just be for salvation to the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed not every one of them believed but those that were ordained to eternal life those are the ones who believed why they deemed themselves worthy of everlasting life hallelujah next paragraph this is not to suggest that there will be no more names from the tribes of israel remaining in the book of life for many of these but not multitudes through the principle of election will be in the gentile church age right like paul and like peter and like john and like all the disciples were jews right but according to election they were elected in the seed portion of the book of life the lamb's book of life so when christ came they received christ signifying proving they could receive the word for their day the word of the hour proving that they were part of this record of eternal life and they they became part of the gentile church age and came into the body of jesus christ showing that their names did indeed remain in the book of life also as we will show according to the fifth seal multitudes of martyred jews will be given white robes and eternal life by the lord also the 144 000 will be sealed at his coming proving that their names were not deleted either but it is even as most accurately set forth in psalm 69 psalm 69 was the one we read earlier about the jews that had rejected christ that it is the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of christ and the destroyers of his people whose names are removed those whose names are removed let's go over to 278. just jump over to 278. and in 278 we're going to read the very last paragraph at the bottom it is the second resurrection the second resurrection is the one that leads the white throne judgment it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar as set forth in the fifth seal are given white robes they're given their white robes why because they're given entrance into the kingdom they're given entrance into eternal life and they're given their white thrones when you read the fifth seal it looks like they're given their white thrones right then while they wait for their brethren to be killed but brother branham's saying they receive their white thrones when at the they receive their white robes at the judgment right they're given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of white robes and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar of the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for their testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony to jesus they were not like antipas who was slain for holding fast his name these are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word see that because of their stand on the word and notice how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek in christ forgive them father they know not what they do these are jews they have to be because they are in the physio and it is in the four seal that the gentile bride is gone in the rapture so these jews aren't born of his spirit they don't even believe that jesus is the messiah but as they were blinded by god for the gentile sake god gave them eternal life on the grounds that they that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died for it as multitudes died under hitler stalin etc and will yet die these did not even know jesus was the messiah do not even have faith in the cross of calvary have no faith in the atonement have no faith in jesus and don't recognize him as savior but because god blinded them so that he could turn to the gentiles if they hold fast to the portion of the word that they can see because god is blinding them to the portion they can't see if they hold fast to that they will be given entrance into eternal life that is mercy now the question is why why because you see the wisdom of god this is the record of the wheat plant and god had laid down in the bible prophecies that have to be fulfilled about the regathering of israel in the last day that the nation will be regathered before christ can return they have to be gathered they have to have an economy they have to have a military they have to have a government they have to have all these things so that christ can come and the two witnesses can come and call out the 144 thousand so that the nation can be born in a day so that they can come to repentance and recognize the atonement 144 thousand so that's impossible unless god would keep a portion of the jews faithful to that portion of the word all down through time for 2 000 years because in order for it to be a regathering judaism can't disperse and intermingle and become like all the other nations they have to be distinct and separate in every nation that they find themselves in they have to hold their relo religion they have to hold to their customs so that the word of god can be fulfilled so that there's something remaining so that when we get to the end of time there can be a regathering out of all nations and and all the prophecy can be fulfilled so that the 144 000 can be in place so that the two prophets can come so that the nation can be born in a day so god has to have jews as placeholders holding the religion holding the desire for the homeland holding the promises out of the bible they're just placeholders holding they're not the 144 000 elect they're not elect but they're on the on the book of life and if they hold that place so that the prophecy can be fulfilled what are they doing they're supporting life they're supporting the coming forth of the eternal life they're supporting the coming forth of the 144 000 elect and if they do it faithfully without rejecting the word of god their names are not taken off the book of life and they're given entrance into eternal life for what being placeholders why god needed them they're not elect they're not in christ but they're holding the position that god wants them to hold so that his work can be fulfilled so that that seed life can come in its appointed time and if they do it faithfully they will be given eternal life that's mercy that's beautiful now what about those who have been faithful to the word they've been blinded but they're faithful to the word and then them two witnesses come and begin to speak of christ and show the atonement of calvary what if those alive in that day reject that their names are blotted off of the book of life because they're rejecting the word when it's made manifest before them alrighty now we'll look at the last group we have those that are good to the brethren we have souls on the altar and we have the foolish virgin let's go to matthew 25. matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish what made them wise and what made them foolish let's read they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut this is the first resurrection the wise who have oil or those who have the holy ghost at the time of his coming have the baptism of the holy ghost are baptized into the body that are part of christ and at his first coming they go into the marriage supper with him they go and the door is closed and this is the first resurrection eleven afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour where the son of man cometh so in this parable they're left out of the first resurrection why because they don't have the baptism of the holy ghost they're not sealed let's look at page 279 in the church age book 279 where we finished we're going to read in the second paragraph it is the second resurrection resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wise had who had oil became part of that bride but these people being a separated god loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed they missed the millennium but the foolish virgin they didn't they weren't sealed they weren't part of christ they didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost they cannot go in the first resurrection but they will go in the second resurrection and he says here they are god-loving people and trying to abide in the word they're trying to abide in the word but they're not abiding into the word because they don't have the revelation of the word but they're trying to abide in the word so these aren't people who just want to live any old kind of life these are virgin clean living people and brother brahm said pure of heart they're wanting to serve god trying to do what's right but they have not been given the revelation on the word so they're not able to keep all the word okay according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord they were a help in the work of the lord how are they helping the work of the lord the same way that the stalk and the tassel and the and everything else is a help in the work of the lord because it's helping to bring forth the life that's in the seed there's so precious few seed that the seed can't do all the work by themselves the seed can't do all the missionary works all the outreach all the evangelistic work right and we were seed and many of us are seed but where did we come from where did we come from it came from the lutheran church came from the nazarene church came from the baptist church came from the wesleyan church came from the catholic church came from came from came from came from where these are all those that are trying to do the work of the lord and what they're doing is becoming part of the plant supporting the life so that you and i could hear the gospel somewhere and be attracted to this and keep moving on in christ until one day we hear the message and then we come to it right but there's so few seed that we can't do the big missionary works can't do the big bible printing can't do all the things that god wants to do to get the word out so that the elect can grab it amen so they are a help in the work of the lord just the same way that the stalk is a help in the work of the lord the same way the tassel is helping in the work of the lord is they're part of the plant helping to reproduce the seed life or to support it has come through and as long as they work in that role just like the jews who were place holders all the way down through 2000 years as long as they're faithful to that work without rejecting the seed life without rejecting the word of god without rejecting the true believers without fighting them or coming against them or calling it an unholy thing then their name will remain on the book of life and at the day of judgment they will be given entrance into eternal life that is a whole lot more mercy amen and they say we're an exclusive bunch there's a whole bunch of people coming in they're just not coming in the first resurrection and they're not going to be part of the millennial reign of christ they're not the brethren they're not joint heirs they are not the bride of jesus christ but there's going to be multitudes and multitudes and multitudes that come in at the white throne judgment i think it's important to note and i'll just interject it right here what what are those in the record of the plant life doing they're supporting and helping the seed whether it be printing bibles and sending them all over the world whether it be having missionary works that go out all over the world or evangelistic works that go out all over the world so that seed can come up through there and then move on to further light or whether they're there to give them a cup of cold water or whether they're there to help them out of a ditch or whether they're there to take care of them when they're sick or visit them in prison or whatever or whether the jews is the placeholder holding forth the place of judaism so that god can restore the word if whatever they're doing they're supporting the seed life all right so let's get over to new heavens and new earth what does this group do with new heavens and new earth the same thing they've always done they support life in the city because they bring their glory and their honor into the city amen they don't dwell in the city the only ones who dwell in the city are the elect so these that come into eternal life they're they're not city dwellers but they're allowed to come into the city because the leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations so they can come in and they can partake of the tree of life and they come in and what do they do they bring their glory and honor they bring their goods they bring whatever fruits and vegetables who knows what that means but they bring their glory and honor as as an offering as a gift they bring it into the city they are supporting city life because in that great city the bride doesn't leave the city none of the elect leave that city they remain in the city with christ forever but the rest of those that have been saved at the white throne judgment and given entrance into eternal life they don't live in the city they live outside the city that's the nations that's the kings right in the book of revelations talked about the kings and the nations coming into the city they come and bring their glory and honor into the city they're doing the same thing that they've always done supporting the seed life amen the revelation that god opened under the seven seals makes absolute perfect sense hallelujah i've never heard an explanation that ever made as much sense as this one questions and answers 1961 let's see brother branham what happens to the people that are considered the sleeping virgin when they are judged at the judgment well the sleeping virgin will be saved of course she'll be saved at the judgment she'll never be the bride but she is a saved group of people that will come in the judgment that will not be included in the bride but as long as they are virgins they are before god see they are to be saved he separates they'll be the sheep on his right hand and the unsaved will be the goats on his left at the great at the great white throne judgment so he says they're going to be saved when are they going to be saved at the judgment they'll be saved see it depends on what you term salvation if salvation is not going into the lake of fire then they're saved then the ones under the altar are saved and those are good to the brethren are saved but if saved for you means going in the rapture they're not saved see the difference what are you calling saved are you calling safe not going into lake of fire then they're saved are you calling saved born again they're not saved all right that's why there's so much confusion sometimes because what are we talking about saved from what saved from judgment then they're not saved saved you know born again they're not that saved from eternal damnation yes they are saved when at the white throne judgment 1963 questions and answers on the seals they the church the people that's in denominations are genuine christians who receives the message and they will never see it so he's saying that the message is going out and they'll never see it it'll never be preached to them so there's a group of people in this in this foolish virgin that the message will never be preached to them they'll never hear it and those in a mixed crowd who it is preached to it'll go right over the top of their heads unless their name was on the lamb's book of life he's talking about that seed portion of the book of life unless their names are in there even if they sit there and it's preached to them it'll go right over their heads right but they will be good people and they'll be raised up again and given trial and be judged by the very group that preached them don't you know the saints will judge the earth now why is it so important that the saints judge the earth because if the judgment is based on accepting or rejecting the word in whatever form it comes in what form has the word come in today the bride of jesus christ right and so no one else can be a witness to that judgment but the bride of jesus christ christ in every age has to be judging that age so we're sitting on the throne and they bring those up and says you never fed me when i was hungry you never clothed me when i was naked when do we do this and they point over to you and they know that the testimony is true that's why we have to sit on judgment because it matters what they do to the word that's in us whether they accept or reject the word that's in us that's why the saints have to judge the world because we are the eye witnesses that prove that the judgment is true that's why we must be there at the white throne judgment sitting on the throne in the seat of judgment that's why judgment was given to the saints because that's the basis for judgment amen church age book 281 no 280 sorry 280 paragraph one start with the first sentence first of all first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands in election it was purposed in himself it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her why can she not come into the judgment because she's redeemed by the blood of the lamb and you can't pass judgment where blood is where the blood is it can't be judged but because she was in the foreknowledge of god for the lamb slain before the foundation of the world right now that's applied to her his blood right she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of the judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in matthew 25. in this class also are those who do not worship the beast or become involved in the antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life thirdly there are the borderline christians such as we saw in israel coming out of egypt these had their names in the book of life and their works written in the books these having failed to obey god and being void of the spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life amongst this group will be the ones like judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestations in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also as balaam will be in that group fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books such are found in revelations 13 8 and revelation 17 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the beast that thou saws was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is jesus said that a certain group would accept one who came in his own name that one is the antichrist and that is exactly what is saying of them in revelations 13 8 and 17 8 these were ordained of god but not unto election and with this group as such that are as pharaoh it says of him even for the same purpose have i raised thee up so he's saying they're ordained they are ordained they are foreknown but not elected even for the same purpose of i raise thee up vessels of wrath fitted to destruction romans 19 17 and 22. none of these would be placed on the records of life i'm not saying that there is no record of them no doubt there is some kind of record of them but not in the records of life let's go to 274 we've got two really short ones to read and then we'll be done 274 and go down to paragraph three as israel chosen people of god in majority forfeited their rights in the book of life by rejecting jesus so the majority of the gentile church would also come into condemnation with the resulting removal of their names from the book of life by rejecting the word and thereby entering into the world ecumenical movement which is the image erected into the beast he didn't say it was going to be the minor group that had their name blotted off the book of life but the majority of the gentile church the majority of the gentile church will have their name blotted off of the lamb's book of life let's turn real quickly over to 279 279 paragraph three all these people had their names in the book of life and their names remain but whose name did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire you cannot ever resist christ and you cannot ever reject christ in whatever form christ comes in it became apparent to the apostle paul where christ was when he met the pillar of fire he knew where christ was then christ was in his believing children amen we'll read this last quote remember they were very religious people that did that they wasn't outsiders they were religious people of that day and that's what's doing it today is the religious people same crucifixion same thing today there they crucified him then sure then they were rejecting god's word made manifest accepting their creeds instead of the word and he's talking about the jews who rejected christ when jesus was standing on the earth and had him crucified and he said they they were rejecting god's word made manifest what were the jews doing when paul and barnabas were standing there preaching christ they were rejecting the word of god made manifest accepting their creeds instead of the word is that what they're doing today that's exactly doing the same today he was the word and they rejected the word that's one point i want you not to miss see i want you not to miss he was the word and when they rejected him they rejected the word and when they did reject him they finally crucified him and that's what they've done today reject the word of god and accepted their creeds and has crucified publicly before their congregation the working of the holy spirit denying the works of god denying the truths of the scripture somebody will go to their pastor and they'll look at you know acts 2 38 and how it was baptized and that pastor will deny that word that's laying openly in the scriptures he has no hope denying the word of god rejecting because of creeds and dogmas and man-made ideas rejecting truth there's no hope why because it's rejecting christ and they're guilty and i indict them in the name of jesus christ that is a harsh statement how can you have your name remaining on the book of life well one you can be part of the record of seed life that can never have your name blotted out or two never come against the true word of god in whatever form the true word of god comes in whether it be a person whether it be the message of the hour whatever the true word is coming don't ever
