[0:00] and listen friends there was 12 spies
[0:02] that went over
[0:03] 12. two came back
[0:08] with a testimony that we're more than
[0:09] able to take it 10 came back saying
[0:11] there's giants and walled cities
[0:13] and 2 million people didn't even see it
[0:16] with their own eyes
[0:17] but they saw the miracles in egypt with
[0:19] their own eyes they saw the manna from
[0:21] heaven
[0:21] they saw that their shoes weren't
[0:23] wearing out they saw that they spoiled
[0:25] egypt
[0:25] they saw enough of the manifestation of
[0:27] the word to know that what moses said
[0:29] was true
[0:30] and it was a confirmation of the promise
[0:31] given to abraham
[0:33] but they took the testimony of 10 human
[0:36] beings
[0:36] that saw something that they didn't see
[0:38] and that became
[0:39] more real to them than the manifestation
[0:42] of the word for that hour
[0:47] you realize without predestination there
[0:49] is absolutely no way friends
[0:51] there is no way they saw miracle after
[0:53] miracle after miracle
[0:55] amen and they come down with a testimony
[0:57] of ten men
[0:58] they go and it was not an undisputed
[1:00] testimony
[1:01] it wasn't that there wasn't another
[1:03] voice saying hey hey wait wait wait wait
[1:05] wait
[1:05] amen for don't forget the promise if god
[1:08] delighted us we're more than able
[1:09] and the camp wanted to kill the two that
[1:12] were speaking the truth
[1:13] [Applause]
[1:15] because the lie
[1:19] what was the lie the lie was not that
[1:22] they have walled cities
[1:24] the lie was not that they were giants
[1:27] the lie was we can't take it
[1:31] because that part was contrary to the
[1:33] word
[1:35] that was the lie they took all the facts
[1:38] and they made the facts to the lie
[1:42] joshua and caleb saw all the facts and
[1:45] after they reviewed all the facts they
[1:46] still told the truth
[1:49] they weren't disputing the facts they
[1:51] weren't saying no there's not wall
[1:52] cities
[1:53] they never said that they never said
[1:55] these ten guys are lying to you
[1:56] about the cities and and the armament
[1:58] and the and the
[2:00] great giants in the land no that's all
[2:02] true that's all true
[2:04] it's true you've got cancer cells in
[2:06] your body it's true
[2:07] amen that you're not feeling good it's
[2:09] true that you ain't got no money it's
[2:10] true that everybody's upset with you
[2:12] it's true that the nation's changing
[2:14] it's true
[2:16] all that they said is true but if he
[2:19] delighting us we're more than able
[2:21] isn't there a promise isn't there a word
[2:23] haven't we seen him keep the word
[2:25] have it aren't we under a prophetic
[2:27] ministry amen are we following the
[2:29] pillar of fire
[2:30] is there not the shekinah glory of god
[2:32] is this not this the word
[2:34] that's been promised to us made manifest
[2:36] how can we get tripped up
[2:37] now by some circumstances that we see
