[0:00] if you're born again your entire nature
[0:02] is changed you are dead to the things
[0:04] that you once thought well you say
[0:06] brother benam when I joined a church I
[0:07] got that well then when God said Jesus
[0:10] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[0:12] forever he still heals the sick he shows
[0:14] Visions but brother Bron my church now
[0:17] you're not born again what's he saying
[0:20] if you reject the word of God because of
[0:22] whatever Church tradition or whatever
[0:24] idea the minute you reject the word of
[0:26] God it proves you're not born again amen
[0:30] cuz this all just blows up the whole
[0:32] idea of being born again from
[0:33] denominational world the denominational
[0:35] world thinks that if you make a
[0:37] confession out of your mouth or you come
[0:38] to an altar you shake a hand or you join
[0:40] the church that you're born again no
[0:42] you're only born again when that seed of
[0:44] God on the inside comes in contact with
[0:46] the Living Word Jesus Christ and he
[0:48] quickens that seed to life and he said
[0:51] you can only have relationship with God
[0:53] if you're a son or daughter of God not a
[0:55] member of a church amen so what makes
[0:57] you a son or daughter of God that you
[0:59] are offspring of God separated of God
[1:02] waiting to come back in contact with
[1:03] your father and what is the new birth
[1:06] it's Jesus Christ revealed personally to
[1:08] you where you're awakened to who you
[1:10] actually
[1:12] are and that seed comes to life and then
[1:14] you know that you're a Son of God
[1:17] because that's the only thing that can
[1:18] bring relationship to God is when you
[1:21] know you're a child of God not a member
[1:23] of a
[1:24] church so these things brother Bram is
[1:26] teaching us is so vital and so important
[1:30] that you must in order to have a
[1:31] relationship you must be sons and
[1:33] daughters and only sons and daughters
[1:35] are born
[1:36] again they're the only ones who can be
[1:38] born again because it's the spiritual
[1:41] birth from the seed that's in the
[1:44] soul praise be to almighty
[1:48] God so you can only have relationship
[1:52] and you can only be a Christian if the
[1:53] Life of Christ lives inside of you and
[1:56] you can only have relationship with God
[1:57] is you have to be relation to him
[2:01] you hear how brother R said that you
[2:02] must be relation to him that means we
[2:05] must be related to have
[2:08] relationship so you can't teach that
[2:11] friends that's not teaching people how
[2:14] to meditate that's not teaching people
[2:16] how to say nice things or come to prayer
[2:18] meetings and that's that's not what
[2:20] builds relationship in order to build a
[2:22] relationship you have to actually be
[2:24] relation and he has to be your father
[2:26] and you have to be a son and that's how
[2:27] you have a relationship right yes
[2:30] not by teaching people how to say
[2:32] prayers or have devotion
[2:36] time we're not we don't we believe we
[2:39] should have devotion time we should
[2:40] believe we should spend time with him we
[2:41] believe should we further our
[2:42] relationship but you can only have a
[2:43] relationship if he's your father and
[2:45] you're his son and you're actually
[2:48] related
[2:50] yeah that's what the prophet is teaching
[2:53] us this message is so different than
[2:56] denominational teaching amen this is the
[2:59] reality to
