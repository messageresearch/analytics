[0:00] When Paul was smitten down to the ground
[0:02] by a pillar of fire and a voice from
[0:04] heaven. Amen. There was other men with
[0:06] him.
[0:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; He wasn't alone.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; But I want to read two accounts out of
[0:11] the book of Acts of this. Acts 9 says,
[0:13] "And the men which journeyed with him
[0:15] stood speechless, hearing a voice, but
[0:18] seeing no man."
[0:20] Then in another place they said, "And
[0:22] they that were with me saw indeed the
[0:24] light and were afraid, but they heard
[0:26] not the voice of him that spoke to me.
[0:30] They heard something but they didn't see
[0:31] a man. And another account they saw a
[0:33] light but they didn't hear the voice.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; That means they were there when Paul had
[0:40] his experience with Jesus Christ.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; But they could not understand what Paul
[0:46] understood and they didn't get out of it
[0:48] what Paul got out of it.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:53] It was individual to Paul, even though
[0:55] they were there when it happened. And
[0:57] they were all struck to the ground, but
[1:00] there was only one who knew that that
[1:02] was Jesus Christ. And there was only one
[1:04] who heard what the voice says. They saw
[1:06] something. They saw a light. They heard
[1:08] something, but they didn't hear the
[1:10] voice of him. Amen. They had an
[1:12] experience when he had an experience,
[1:14] but his experience was special and
[1:16] unique to Paul alone. And he's the only
[1:19] one that saw Christ and heard Christ and
[1:22] understood the message.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter who's with you.
[1:27] Amen. You could sit in the same church
[1:29] service and everybody can hear things
[1:30] and see things and and experience things
[1:32] on a different level, but you can hear
[1:34] preaching and everybody can walk out and
[1:36] they can walk out and say, "Listen, I've
[1:38] had it happen in the foyer. Brother
[1:40] Chad, you don't know that was for me."
[1:44] There was a part there where everything
[1:45] you said was exactly what I was praying
[1:48] about.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Same service. Somebody else will say,
[1:51] "Brother Chad, that was for me. That's
[1:52] what me and my wife were talking about
[1:54] last night."
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, you compare notes and you say,
[1:58] "This message was for me." You said,
[1:59] "No, it was for me." You say, "Well,
[2:02] this was the best part of the sermon."
[2:03] No, this was the best part of the
[2:04] sermon. They both heard and they saw.
[2:06] Amen. But there was something individual
[2:08] to you. In every service, in every book,
[2:11] in every tape, every time you read your
[2:13] Bible, every time you pray, there's a
[2:15] relationship that's just for you.
[2:17] There's something that's just for you
[2:19] alone. And no matter how much you
[2:21] explain it, other people listen, you may
[2:23] have a prayer request. You may have a
[2:25] desire in your heart. You may have a
[2:26] question that you've been praying about
[2:28] and you shared it with nobody. And all
[2:30] of a sudden, right over the pullpit
[2:31] comes, bang, bang, bang. That's exactly
[2:33] what I was praying about. And you can go
[2:35] out with enthusiasm and tell somebody
[2:37] else and they'll say, "Oh, that's so
[2:39] nice."
[2:41] &gt;&gt; But there's no way they can understand
[2:43] what's happening inside of you, God just
[2:45] spoke to you. God just answered your
[2:47] question. God just gave you exactly what
[2:50] you were looking for. And for you, it's
[2:51] the greatest thing that ever happened.
[2:53] For somebody else, that's exciting.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; I'm happy for you.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; And after you've explained it two or
[3:01] three times, you said, "I'm not going to
[3:02] explain it to nobody else." They just
[3:04] don't get it.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; And the truth is they can't get it. That
[3:07] was you behind the veil. That was God
[3:09] whispering in your ear because it's love
[3:12] secrets to you as an individual. He's
[3:14] whispering the answer back to you.
[3:17] Everybody else heard the same words.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; But to you, it was a personal meeting
[3:23] with you and God.
