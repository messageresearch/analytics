[0:00] Sell all that thou hast and give to the
[0:02] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[0:05] heaven.
[0:07] This man, no matter what he said, he
[0:10] called Jesus good and master, but no
[0:12] matter what he says to Jesus, he shows
[0:15] how much he values the word.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; His actions declare the value he has on
[0:22] Jesus Christ, the word made flesh.
[0:24] Because when Jesus says this, you ask me
[0:27] what to do, this is what you need to do.
[0:29] Sell all that you have, give to the
[0:30] poor, and you'll have treasure in
[0:32] heaven. Listen, if this man loved God,
[0:34] loved the word, loved heaven, he would
[0:36] sell everything for heaven
[0:38] &gt;&gt; because heaven's more valuable than
[0:40] anything on the earth. BUT HE VALUED the
[0:42] earth more than heaven.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; And then ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, TAKE up
[0:51] your cross, bear a reproach
[0:55] &gt;&gt; and follow me.
[0:57] And he was sad at the saying and went
[1:01] away grieved because he had great
[1:04] possessions.
[1:08] This is a sad story.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Because the man has come to God in
[1:16] flesh.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; He's come to the fresh mana, to the word
[1:20] for his day, through the through the
[1:22] rock where water can flow out. come to
[1:24] this point
[1:25] &gt;&gt; and he says, "What must I do to inherit
[1:28] eternal life?" And Jesus tells him
[1:30] exactly what he must do. He has the
[1:33] ticket. He has the answer. There's no
[1:36] question mark. If he does what God tells
[1:37] him to do, he will have the results
[1:39] Jesus promised him. Amen. And so this
[1:42] man, he left sad. OH MY GOODNESS. HOW
[1:45] COULD HE LEAVE SAD? I WOULD LEAVE SO
[1:47] HAPPY. AMEN. I NOW KNOW WHAT I GOT TO
[1:50] DO. AND ALL I GOT TO DO IS GIVE UP THE
[1:52] WORLD AND HAVE HIM. ALL I GOT TO DO IS
[1:54] GIVE UP MY LIFE AND SACRIFICE MYSELF.
[1:56] AND IF I'LL DO THAT, I CAN HAVE HIM AND
[1:58] I CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE AND I CAN BE
[2:00] WHERE HE IS. WHY WAS HE SAD? HE SHOULD
[2:02] HAVE BEEN RUNNING AWAY, CLICKING HIS
[2:04] HEELS, CALLING AN AUCTIONEER ON THE WAY.
[2:06] WILL YOU COME AND HELP ME SELL
[2:07] EVERYTHING I'VE GOT? CALL THE SALVATION
[2:09] ARMY AND SAY, "I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
[2:11] DISTRIBUTE THESE GOODS BECAUSE I FOUND
[2:13] THE WAY TO HAVE WHAT MY HEART'S
[2:15] CRAVING." AMEN.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; HE WENT AWAY SAD BECAUSE HE GAVE LIP
[2:20] SERVICE TO LOVING GOD. LIP SERVICE TO
[2:22] WANTING HEAVEN. BUT WHAT HE REALLY
[2:24] WANTED MORE, he valued more his fleshly
[2:27] carnal life than eternal life.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; GOD HELP ME NEVER TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS
[2:33] PLACE WHERE I VALUE SOMETHING OF THIS
[2:35] WORLD MORE THAN I VALUE ETERNAL LIFE,
[2:37] MORE THAN I VALUE Christ himself.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; CUZ REMEMBER, ETERNAL LIFE IS NOT A
[2:42] REWARD.
[2:44] Eternal life is a person.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PERSON OF GOD HIMSELF BECAUSE
[2:49] ONLY GOD HAS eternal life. Zoe life.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
