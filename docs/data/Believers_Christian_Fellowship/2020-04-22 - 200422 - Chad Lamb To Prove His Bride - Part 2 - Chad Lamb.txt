========================================

[Applause] [Music] if in my life [Music] lord we glorify today one more time in my life be glorified in [Music] my life [Music] lord amen dress that's the prayer of everyone's heart let's just sing this song only believe as that brother chad comes brother branham tells us all the time that the angel of the lord enjoys this song and they believe so let's not sing it for us let's sing it for him because we know that he enjoys this song all things are possible [Applause] all things are possible only believe [Music] jesus jesus is here all things is here all things [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] are possible lord i believe all things are possible hallelujah it's more than a song the testimony of faith all things are possible amen let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to isaiah 55. we'll read this together uh i just talked to brother gene petri just a few minutes before i left the house to come here and he's improving he's seeing improvement in all of his vitals and everything and he talked to his doctor today and his doctor said if things keep going the way they're going he he looks to be able to send him home on friday and so i told brother gene i said hey we'll come and get you we'll take you home however he said brother i'm willing to walk home you know he wants to get home really bad but i thank god you know he was using a very high level of oxygen they couldn't send him home because there was no way for him to get that much oxygen and he was using 12 liters a day and he said that's got to get down to six or below before they can send him home so i asked him today i said what was it at and he says eight it dropped four liters in one day as his need so his lungs are working better they're absorbing auction out of the air better and so he's he's doing better but let's just keep praying that god and brother gene petrie spares that he can go with no oxygen and then go home friday with no oxygen but let's just pray and then he also found out sonja his daughter sonya had been running a low grade fever so they went to have her tested for coveted and she did test positive she's not very ill she just has low grade fever and feeling tired but we need to pray for the whole family they've all been together in close contact we just need god to intervene for them and brother gene can come home and they can all recover and do well together so don't don't forget them when you're praying let's look at isaiah 55 together isaiah 55 and verse 6. seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and let the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts praise god let us bow our heads and pray heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this opportunity to be together we thank you god that you allow us lord to open the pages of this bible once again and read from it lord and god we appreciate the privilege of being able to hold a bible and being able to be literate and read but we need more than that lord tonight we need you to bring divine revelation on your word we need you to unlock this word to our hearts lord that we can connect with it on the level that you want us to understand them i pray god that you would bless your people as we hear your word that you would use lord the gift within this vessel for your glory that we could have ears to hear in our heart to perceive all that you have for us this evening in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated let's turn to romans chapter 11 and read from there also i think it goes without saying that his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts higher than our thoughts but but it's amazing although we know this we know it soundly we know it firmly we've testified to the experience of seeing it yet we always tend to fall back to our own thinking it's a trap you know we get trapped in our own minds our own thinking or our own uh understanding from years of experience and the way we interact with the world and so the constant fight is to take the word and if the word's different than my thinking reject my thinking and take the word you know the biggest problem we have is reasoning and reasoning is our enemy i mean it's not it's not doing us any favors reasoning is our enemy and we must fight that and have the mind of christ which comes from his word and we need the spirit to to to unlock the word for us so that we can see it the way he wants us to see it let's read here in romans 11 33 all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen so god's ways are higher than our ways who has ever given him counsel who's had a better idea who can advise god who can give him a piece of information or give something to god that god will owe him something back it'll never happen that way god god's ways are so much different than our ways as human beings that we have to learn to reject our thinking and reject our ways and take his way above all else so that's what we're constantly doing all the time let's go to the book of acts acts chapter 1. i'm just continuing on with the same thought from sunday so it's the same title to prove his bride this will be part two but i want to look at acts this isn't really part of my uh my thought this is just something that god awakened me to this weekend and i want to read this scripture and and just remind you what the lord reminded me of verse 8 acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth now if you'll remember that was the text that we took our thought from for our watch night service if you remember and i had completely forgotten and god brought this back to my memory over the weekend that at watch night i said that my vision for us as individuals and for the church is that you'll be my witness starting in jerusalem and in judea and de samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and that jerusalem is us our own selves that the word must be alive that we must be witnesses within our own self of the word and then judea our family and then samaria and our area and our friends and extended family and then to the uttermost parts of the earth and that was for me what i got god was calling for us to be our focus and what a great way to accomplish that purpose amen i felt god impressed me to bring that on watch night and that that should be our goal that that first that that the doctrine is sound in me that i have a real connection with jesus christ and i'm really living a genuine life from my heart and there's no hypocrisy in me that i i am what i proclaim to be all the way through that that you feel the you know that that that that we are filled amen with the spirit of god and we're living a true life and then from there we strengthen our families amen and then from the families to our associates in our area and our community and then to the uttermost parts of the earth and so god shut down the uttermost parts of the earth we can't travel we can't go anywhere i had a trip planned and for easter i was supposed to go for easter to preach easter convention in two different countries and god shut that down in fact he shut the whole world down amen nobody's going anywhere so we don't worry about the uttermost parts of the earth amen and then you know god limited some of our our our socialization some of our travel even in our community and even some people's work and limited that and brought us back into the home amen so we don't have to worry about that and so god give us a little more time some of us have a little more time to focus on the word and be in prayer and all this stuff so god we felt like that was god directing us amen but if god thought we missed the point he was going to make sure that he set the scenario right so that we could start in jerusalem and then in judea and then in samaria and maybe if the borders ever opened to the uttermost parts of the earth so when god hit that when that come back like a memory to me i said oh praise god this is exactly in line with the way he was leading us anyways and it looks like a disaster but it's exactly god fulfilling his purpose he he wants he wants us to start with us if we're going to run with a message we have to have a message we can't just be running and we shouldn't have you know half of it or or half the life but we need to be filled with the word amen we need to be the word on display and we need to spend enough time with god that god can root out all of those things that are contrary to him amen you know god is god is able to shut down i mean he shuts down whatever he wants to shut down he shuts down travel he shuts down entertainments i mean even people who are struggling with sports praise god it's not a struggle he shut them down you know all of these things god has a way of shutting things down the in in putting us in a place where his will can be accomplished in our lives and and sometimes it's uncomfortable and it's not pleasant and there's there's maybe some sacrifices that we have to go through but god is going to accomplish his purpose he's going to get us and if that's what he was if the leading that i felt was correct amen and i believe it was with all my heart at watch night that that's the direction we should go in god has just made it so much easier to accomplish this purpose so i'm thankful i'm thankful that god can prepare us and god can come along and do what sometimes we're incapable of doing ourselves we wouldn't have shut down our fellowship and socialization and travel willingly and voluntarily we wouldn't have shut that down so god did amen because this is this matters to god and and i feel like if we can catch what he's doing and already we have and so many of you have testified that you're feeling stronger stronger in the lord more time to meditate on god think about what we're doing more time in the home to strengthen the family more family alter more family prayer time more devotions more discussion on the word of god more hearing the prophet's voice in the house more and more and more of those things amen is exactly what we need and god is strengthening us from jerusalem our home base amen and then judea our family bases and then moving out from there as he opens that up but but thank god amen he's kept things in the situation they need to be long enough for us to get strong so this is not to weaken us this is to strengthen us this is not for the weakening of the church this is for the strengthening of the church even times the times that we couldn't gather together was not for the weakening of the churches for the strengthening of the church and still we can't all gather together amen it's not possible right now but it's for the strengthening of the church it's for the strengthening why because this building is not the church so it it's not for the strengthening of the building the structure the edifice has nothing to do with that the church is the bride it is the people it is the dwelling place it is the temple of the holy ghost and god wants to strengthen that dwelling place individually as families as a local congregation and moving out from there but praise be to god he set up the circumstances that he's driving it the way he wants it to go and i'm thankful because i'm seeing i'm seeing it produce fruit i'm seeing the trial produce fruit i'm seeing the circumstances produce fruit and i thank god for that because his ways are higher than our ways his ways he who can find them out who can instruct him who could have told him this was the best way who would have come up with this plan and say god i think the best thing that you could do is let a worldwide virus break out shut down everything amen send us home from work and force us to be at home more that was not in our mind that was not our idea but god has everything under control he knows what he's doing nothing's out of control with god so i'm going to read this quote from that we read from sunday to kind of set the stage for the thought and then move from there and the god of this evil age he preached in august of 65 said what would god call a people out of this evil age for his name why he's asking a question why for what reason would god call a people out of this evil age for his name he said the reason is is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proven to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end so how was it in the beginning amen the the the bride adam's bride was proven to satan but she failed she didn't pass the test but we're coming full circle back to the proving again of the wife of the last adam only she's predestinated to pass the test do you realize friends what what an accomplishment that is for god but also what a consolation that is for us that she's predestinated not to fall you know because if we just look at ourselves you could say you know in myself as a human being i would say i'm destined to fall i'm destined to fail on the human side if i look at myself and my human abilities and my mind and my strength and my willpower and all of these things that we have as a natural part of being a human it's destined to fail it will fail it will fail over and over and over again that's why we can put no confidence in willpower or ability or intellectual understanding our confidence is in the word of god it will happen because he said it will happen not because i'm able to make it happen you know what a consolation because if it was up to us to reverse what eve did we would just keep continuing to fail in eve's failure but it's not up to us god and brother man said god put himself in partnership with man but it's not a partnership where where it's one of those things where god needs your strength and he needs your ability and god's just sitting idly by waiting for you to get strong enough he's on partnership he just needs your vessel to accomplish his purpose because he has to do it through man he's on partnership with you but not partnership and your strength or ability it's not that kind of partnership he just needs the tabernacle you dwell in and he needs to bring life to the seat he put in that tabernacle so he needs you to get out of the way that's the partnership the partnership is stay out of my way while i do what i'm going to do oh hallelujah so he's got he's got his own partnership to accomplish his goal but our end of the deal is not to get in the way and run around and figure a bunch of stuff out our our purpose and our goal should be to die as much as i can possibly die to my human side to forget everything i've ever known amen to count it all is done amen to lay aside all of my reasoning and all of my ability and just die and be humble and be lonely and be nothing so that he can take this nothing and he can do what he's always predestinated to do in this hour so what do i have to do nothing just believe him and get out of the way because you're predestinated this bride is predestinated not to fall and if it wasn't that way it would there was no way you could keep from falling if it wasn't for the predestinated plan of god there's no way but because it's the predestinated plan of god it cannot fail everything's going to be all right that's a great consolation so why in this evil age why in such a dark evil age would he call out a bride for his name why after you know there's been so many ages and so many days gone by and different dispensations and none of them was the age that he was gonna bring forth his bride and perfection it was building a bride absolutely but this is the time that he's gonna bring his bride into perfection and what time does he wait for he waits for the worst possible time i mean i'm talking humanly speaking from a reasoning perspective amen when everything is stacked against the bride and everything in the world has come to the peak of this evil age in satan's eden where he has full sway over everything the news you read he's in control of it amen the images that are on display he's in control of it he's in every government he's in control of it the laws that are passed he's in control of it everything that's going on all policy he's in control of it this is satan's eden he is the god of this evil age and he's in full power and full authority in in this world and that's the way god wants it and humanly speaking be like that's the worst time amen to bring forth your bride but in god's mind that's the best time to bring forth his bride because he he's in he's he's in a showdown he's in a war amen with his enemy lucifer amen and he wants to prove to satan that she's not like eve and what better way to prove it than to let satan say now now i'm going to give you 6 000 years and you can do whatever you want i'm giving you free reign whatever you can convince the people to do whatever you and your horde of demons can move the people to do i'm giving you free reign to do it and when you get it perfect when you've accomplished everything that you want to accomplish and you've got everything wrapped up as tight as you can get it wrapped up that's when i'm going to bring her forth and you can test her with everything you got every every entertainment every pleasure i mean you can bombard her with the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life and and fill her senses full of it fill her mind her ears her eyes i mean every sense is full of the pride of life the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes the three things that eve was tried by and now we live in a world that is absolutely inundated with those things and that's when he's going to bring her up and say see and she won't fall she's predestinated not to fall amen so god for some reason he likes to work against the odds if you read through the bible god loves to work against the odds i mean no matter how many they bring they bring tens of thousands and then to camp against jerusalem to come against israel they bring hundreds of thousands god says hmm we got too many oh they've got 150 000 plus cherries well let's get it down let's get it down let's see i think 300 will do that's the way god likes it he likes his city under siege he likes his army outnumbered i don't understand it but i know god loves to prove his word that's what the prophet tells us his thinking's not like our thinking his ways are not like our ways god loves to work out of humility amen he loves to work out of weakness amen when jesus came there was no beauty that we should behold him he had no strength might ability no pedigree he had nobody on his side and in fact the closer he came to the purpose he was on earth the fewer people would even associate with him so as he grew in weakness god was growing in his ability to show forth his power and when jesus was utterly weak in the flesh he was he was as weak as he could be in captivity amen arrested in bonds beaten mercilessly to where he could not carry his own cross because he was so weakened in the flesh marred his vision so marred he didn't even look like a man as weak as he could get in absolute weakness and defeat he had the greatest victory he's ever had and if that's the way god likes to work amen why should it surprise us when he keeps pulling the rug out from under us and taking away strength and taking away comforts and taking away things that we begin to lean on if we're leaning on anything besides the word of god god's going to take it away from us until we're standing with nothing we have nothing we don't have a proper understanding like we should uh brother remember if we if you think you know anything you know nothing as you should that's what the scripture says we don't have enough understanding enough wisdom enough experience enough strength we don't have anything and so anything that we're using to compensate for our weakness he's taking it away taking away reputations taking away perceived strength taking away numbers taking away everything take it all away so you have nothing to depend on but the word of god and with the word of god in the word of god alone amen this bride will stand and she will reverse what has been done in the garden of eden with nothing but faith in the word of god hallelujah there's so many times we want to see something you know we want to see something mighty we want to see something powerful and then it gives us faith once once i see something happen then it gives me faith to believe but god wants us after faith to believe when you see nothing happen when there's nothing on the surface moving when nobody's having a dynamic display of anything but everybody's in their homes praying quietly with their family amen that's when god's doing something and that's when we we just want to see something amen and then i can believe and i'm encouraged amen but god is getting his bride into a different place amen where she can believe when she sees nothing it's a hard place to be as human beings but it's where god wants us so why why would god call a people of this evil age for his name the reason is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proven to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end it goes down two paragraphs later he says we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve that she is not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word only this one won't fail in 1954 brother brahm says in the message god has provided away see how god does testing god permits you sometimes to get a little worse after you're prayed for just to test you that is not what we like to hear but he says god does that you know with the denominational mindset that's counter as counter to the denominational mindset because the denominational mindset is god is a good god he wants to bless you he wants to do good for you and right many of us spend our time in denomination with the nominational mindset and we understand how some of that works but but he says he permits you sometimes to get a little worse after you're prayed for just to test you the testings and trials of faith but he that endureth there it is hold on take god at his word believe every word of it no matter what anything else says or does believe it anyhow no matter what the circumstances look like believe god anyhow so we've got to quit using our eyes to have faith and you say well of course brother chad but i mean it's the same trap we always fall into where our eyes and our ears and our mind are bombarded by negative messages and and over and over more negative and more negative and more negative and all of a sudden it gets harder and harder to encourage yourself in faith because of what the eyes see in the ears here and what you read in text messages coming across i mean we've been in a long grinding trial long one person gets well another person gets sick and very sick and it grinds on and there's nothing else we'd like to hear then everybody's better and there's no more problems but god is allowed one after the other for the drag four weeks five weeks until until we're tired and the only thing that we can do is stand on the word god's word doesn't change he'll let it grind on if he wants it to grind a little longer what's he doing he's grinding all of you out of you he's grinding all of me out of until we say you know what not what i read on a text is going to encourage me anymore not what i hear with my ears or see with my eyes but what i see in this bible is where my encouragement is going to come from because he's made promises and he's the one who's able to keep them i never could do anything to begin with but now i'm more sure of it than i ever was before there's nothing i can do to bring to pass the word of god all i can do is believe in it and wait for him to bring it to pass all that's required is faith in his word that's what he's asking for that's what he's looking for he's always been looking for faith in his word he's always been requiring faith in his word and when he finds a somebody who can believe his word then he moves on the word and brings it to pass but he does it his way sometimes he lets it get a little worse after you prayed for just to see what you'll do no matter what the circumstances look like believe god anyhow let's go to john chapter 11. i want to look at a story or two here in the bible and then in the new testament then i want to look at job for a little while john chapter 11. i'm going to begin at verse 3. is the story of lazarus he's sick says verse three therefore his sister sent unto him saying lord behold hume thou loveth the sick when jesus heard that he saith this sickness is not unto death key in on that jesus said this sickness is not unto death because the disciples are going to get confused because of that statement see god is not obligated to make things easy for a carnal mind to comprehend he's not obligated to make it simple to a carnal mind he makes it simple to the mind of christ and he makes it simple by revelation but he's not obligated to make it simple to a carnal understanding this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby it says now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that he saith unto his disciples let us go into the jail again so he gets word that he finds out that lazarus is sick and he says this sickness is not unto death but the glory of god and he makes a statement he knows he's sick they sent him to him because he was really sick but then he hangs out for two more days amen it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind because they're asking him there's a reason they're notifying him lazarus is sick and you find out when he shows up on the scene both sisters say lord if you had been here he had not died they were calling for jesus to come and pray for lazarus they were calling for him to come and change the scene he knew he was sick he knew that they come for him but yet he had to wait and not go right then because if he went right then it wouldn't work out the way god wanted to work because sometimes it's got to get a little worse before it gets better because that's the plan of god sometimes it's got to get a little worse before it gets better so verse 11 these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may wake him out of his sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of a rest in sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead he just said the sickness is not to death can you imagine being a disciple that day well i mean that's take place over two days but didn't we hear him did did i hear him wrong peter andrew help me out here did i hear him right he said the sickness is not the death but he just says lazarus is dead mother is dead and i'm glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him jesus says it was good for you that i didn't go but in waiting he died yeah that's a good thing you understand we can never use the carnal mind to understand god and we can never figure god out we have to be very careful that we never try to use reasoning and logic to understand god because god doesn't operate by reasoning and logic and reasoning and logic will never understand god you can only understand god by faith it says our friend lazarus or i'm sorry he goes down to verse 15. i'm glad for your sakes that i was not there he's now dead and i'm glad amen i love the lord and i love his word to the intent that he may believe nevertheless let us go unto him let's go down to verse 21. he shows up martha runs out to him and then he said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died see they had known of jesus raising the dead before they known of jesus healing the sick right they have known of jesus to be a healer of the sick and they've even known of jesus to raise the dead but here she comes and she knows she knows without question that if jesus had come lazarus wouldn't die she's got absolute faith in what she's seen done before she has absolute faith in the ability of jesus to heal the sick without question there wasn't a question in martha's mind that if you had been here he would have not died so she's got a degree of faith she believes he says verse 22 but i know listen what she says but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee i know he wouldn't have died but what he what even right now whatever you ask him god will give it to you then jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again martha's in them i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day going back to her understanding of the bible and she's not wrong but she's not right she's right but she's missing the point amen jesus said under i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this she saith in them yea lord i believe that thou art christ the son of god which should come into the world skip down to verse 32 now mary comes her sister then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down on his feet saying unto him lord if thou had been here my brother had not died out of the mouth of two or three witnesses they are a believing family they believe in the power of god to heal they believe in the ministry of jesus christ they believe he was the son of god that was coming to the world and they knew beyond a shadow of doubt if jesus would have been there he would not have died they don't understand why he delayed in coming two days they don't know why lazarus is dead they don't know why he came late his disciples don't know why he said the sickness is not in the death and he says lazarus is dead and i'm happy for your sex i wasn't there do you understand they don't understand any of this right now none of this makes any sense to them right now amen and if you've ever been in a trial and right in the middle of it not anything makes sense nothing's working the way it's supposed to work nothing makes sense you can't even figure out what god is possibly doing in all of this it's backwards from what i think the word says it's different than what i know about the lord it's different than what he's ever done with me before amen but you know that he can deliver you you know that he's a healer you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if he was here you would be healed so why is things happening the way they're happening because it's good for you that he didn't do it earlier it's good for me that he didn't come quicker amen praise god oh i hope that i can get to where this becomes a natural expression for me not not that i have to wrestle it out on nights of endless prayer before i finally settle down and say god's in control i want to get to the places the pride of jesus christ where whatever happens i can say praise god all as well because his word's not going to fail he knows where i'm at if he delays his coming if he lets it get worse it's all good amen i i'm i'm tired amen of carnal reasoning i'm tired of a fleshly mind i'm tired of natural education and understanding in science i'm tired of leaning on those props i want to be able to lean solidly on the word of god and say he will show up in time he will deliver according to his word he will do what he's promised to do and he'll do it at the perfect time amen that's where he's trying to get us that's where i want to be i want to be just like martha who says hey if you had been here he had not died but even now whatever you say it'll be amen i say god help us not to miss what you're doing verse 39 jesus comes to the grave and verse 39 jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he's been dead four days now she just said if you had been here he not died and g but she said even now whatsoever you ask god will give it to you she she's a believer friend she's not an unbeliever but he's been dead for days i mean she's a believer but it's been four days she believes in christ and knows he's the son of god but it's been four days you see how quickly human reasoning slips in and none of us can fault her for that because we would all be in the same situation as martha was we can't condemn her for that we can't falter for that but but you can see how quickly human reasoning enters in and blinds us to what god is doing because it's not reasonable he's been dead four days he's going to stink don't roll the stone away what are you rolling the stone away for anyways you're going to let all the smell out he wasn't rolling the stone away that let the smell out he was rolling the stone away to let lazarus out he wasn't worried about the stink that was going to be fixed in a moment but she knew that corruption sets in after 72 hours corruption had already sat into lazar's body and decay had already begun but the prince of life was there to reverse the gay they had seen sick healed who weren't dead yet they had seen dead raised up who had just died amen but they hadn't seen somebody who began to decay already raised up to life but just because it was new was no reason to disbelieve just because he did something he'd never done before is not a reason to disbelieve and these are believers but reasoning is our enemy history is our enemy our human mind is the it's the enemy to our faith praise be to god let's read that again martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he has been dead for days jesus said in her said i not unto thee you already missed it i already said ahead of time said i not unto thee that if thou would has believed thou should have see the glory of god then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou has heard me i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which standeth by i said it that they may believe that thou has sent me now jesus is praying out loud but he didn't need to pray out loud lazarus would have come out of the ground if he would have whispered it or thought it but he said it for the benefit of the others so that they could hear what he had to say and when he thus spoke he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead come forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with napkin jesus said to him loose him and let him go what did jesus show up for for this moment he showed up after the fourth day after he's been dead four days and he shows up to deliver him from his bondage to deliver him from his death to deliver him and set him free now let's look at verse 45 and 46. i read this today and i've read this over and over again but sometimes i read something that strikes me different and i started laughing i mean i read this and i was belly laughing in my office because it struck me different this time verse 45 then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him but some of them went their way to the pharisees and told them the things jesus had done that's when i started laughing they were telling on him for raising the dead they were tattling to the pharisees to get jesus in trouble for raising the dead for losing the bound for preaching resurrection in life to him that had been dead for four days and because he lived and because they loosed him some believed but others ran to the pharisees to tell on him that struck me as so funny they're tattling on jesus for raising the dead [Applause] like it was a bad thing like he shouldn't have done it without their approval like like somehow he's wrong how was he wrong in what way did he do wrong but see they're so bound in their minds by religion and tradition amen when they seen him come and do something without the approval of the pharisees without the approval of the religion and he came and did it just by the leadership of god amen they looked at it and to them they they were disturbed by what they saw and they had to run and tattle why because they were bound by that jewish religion but jesus come to break the jewish religion i wrote down here in my notes jesus disrupted the religion of the jews but not the word of god jesus was a total disruption to the religious system he was a total disruption to the hold that they had and they kept the people bound by the law amen and they they put themselves in control of the people and they had a whole religious exercise that people had to be exercised by amen but jesus come to break that yoke and break that yoke and break that yoke to set the people free what he was doing for lazarus is what he intended to do for the entire jewish nation for the whole nation of israel for all of them he intended to come and set them free but they didn't want to go free they wanted to stay in the grave clothes because it was familiar because they were already accustomed to it because it had become normal they wanted to stay there instead of accepting the freedom that they could have but freedom meant walking a path they had never walked before freedom meant following the lord wherever he would lead and leaving the familiar and leaving the great heritage that we've had and walking in newness of life that was scary because they'd never seen it done but praise be to god amen he's loosed us from our grave clothes he's rolled away the stone amen there was there was a church that had been bound into nominational systems but but he came amen and in the fourth stage of the restoration of the bride tree he brought her back to life that's why he said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is because the son of man has come to bring resurrection power to those who are trapped in religion and denominationalism and bring him out and loose him from the grave clothes why because after 2 000 years it stinks it's rotten it's failed everything man has done to make a religious system is absolutely rotten amen and god is not worried about the smell that's in there because he's going to bring us out of there there's corruption in religion there's corruption and denomination amen but he's bringing us out without corruption and he says loosen loosen from the grave close set him free you would have thought that every jew every pharisee sadducee herod every jew would run and say praise god i want to serve a living god i want to serve a god that raises the dead after four days i want to serve a god like that but they did and they ran to the pharisees to tell on jesus do you know what that man did he's done raise the dead we can't let that continue we don't want somebody to raise people from the dead and loose them from their grave clothes what's going to happen to us if we let that continue oh my goodness spirits don't die they just continue right on unfolding and unfolding and unfolding you get a people that'll take god at his word and believe god at his word and stand on the word of god somebody can't wait to go tell somebody tattle it on them tell on them and say can you believe what they're doing they're taking a stand on the word of god and they're believing god we can't let this stand my goodness why not let people believe brother branham said if i didn't have enough faith to make the word of god work i sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody else who had enough faith to make it work i'd encourage him if you've got enough faith to get out of the boat and you heard the lord bid you come walk i want to see you walk i want to see somebody walk on water i want to see somebody free from glade growth i want to see somebody get healed i want to see somebody to be delivered i want to see somebody fly higher than anybody's ever flown in the word before i don't want to say this is the limit to flying high because we've never been past here and if you go past here i'm going to tell the pharisees on you don't tattle on me for spreading my wings and flying don't tattle amen just fly with me friends just try it once it's good like we were saying sunday peter got out of the boat none of the rest of them got out of the boat but the boat wasn't safer than the water the perception was the boat was the safe place but they had already lost faith in the boat before jesus came walking on the water but when jesus come walking in the water it was so different than anything they've ever seen before they decided to stay with the boat that they already knew wasn't working my goodness friends we human beings are pathetic creatures and i say we because i'm a pathetic creature as a human being i'm worthless and i'm miserable and i'm no good and i'm never going to get it right but as a seed gene of god i'm predestinated to believe that word and if i don't get it right the first time i'll try the second time and if not the second the third time but there's coming a time that i'm going to fully believe every word and it's going to manifest completely in this body of flesh and if i fail a thousand times it doesn't matter because there's going to be a time that it's going to work so don't condemn me for it failing time after time after time amen you should be encouraging me to try it again i encourage you to try it again i mean i want to see somebody that stinks get out of the grave and come walking forth and jesus said unbind him amen i want to help unwrap the bindings i want to pull the napkin off of his face and say god bless you brother you smell good to me somebody can run and tattle to the religious leaders and to the pharisees but i want to help unwind disclose and i want to say man let's see that again let's do that again where's the next one jesus bids peter he comes walking on the water brother bam says it was scary to them it looked spiritual spooky why they've never seen anybody walk on the water before spooky but he calls out it is i be of good cheer be not afraid whenever we get in trouble and we know the boat's not going to work anymore the place we're in isn't working the doctor has failed our job has failed our money has failed when we get in whatever boat we're riding in when it's failed when it's come to the end don't be scared when god starts to do something he's never done before and when he starts to show up in such a unique way that you've never seen it and i've never seen anybody delivered this way don't be afraid of that as long as you can hear him say it is i be of courage be not afraid and peter has something in him that says wherever he is that's where i want to be oh i encourage you all to be like that amen but make sure you don't go presumptuously make sure you wait for him to say come on make sure we follow the leadership of the lord he said come peter goes out walking on the water what was holding him up faith nothing but faith because when he looked around at the waves and began to doubt he sank proving that the molecules didn't change in the water it was faith he was walking on because when he doubted it could no longer hold him up and he began to sink and god had to rescue him but peter made it further by faith than any of the other disciples had ever made so why criticize peter for failing why point a finger at him and tell him you failed and it didn't work and you tried and you proved that it doesn't work all he proved was it works it works he failed so what he walked on the water don't condemn him for the failure amen bless him encourage him amen maybe next time he'll make it a little further maybe next time a little further it doesn't matter how many times he goes under the fact that he was able to walk on the water is the impressive thing to me the fact that somebody is able to take god at his word and believe it i don't care if it fails from time to time i don't care if they look around in the storms in doubt and god has to rescue them but hey if you've ever worked for you do it again and don't be afraid to do it the next time don't be afraid of something unusual or something different amen just hear his voice calling and say can i come and when he says come just we can't be afraid we can't be so tied up amen in religion amen that we can't move forward when god calls us to move forward and we may think we're free from that but we're not free from that he's breaking us free from that bit by bit day by day he's breaking us from that and i say god break it from me i don't want religion i don't want a system i don't want my own system and my own religion i just want the reality of your word in my life i got it's got to be real amen but if it's going to be real like the bible was real if it's going to be real like the book of acts was real we better get used to hearing this voice and doing what nobody else is doing because that's how the book of acts was that's how the entire bible was amen they were always doing something they had never done before what about the woman who touched the hymn of his garment to be healed what bible verse was she reading what story out of the scriptures encouraged her to do that what was it i mean where did she get that idea it was inspiration she was inspired and she knew within herself if i can only touch the hem of his garment i will beat every every made every bit whole so she crawled through the crowd and she pushed her way through and brother ben said she got on her hands and knees and weaved her way through and just touched him of his garment and she was instantly healed [Applause] based off what bible verse it was an inspiration that came to her from god and she had enough of something in her to move on that inspiration and it worked jesus he comes to a meal and a woman brings an alabaster box and she breaks the box of very precious ointment and begins to anoint him and anoint his feet and wipe his feet with her hairs and the disciples look at that and they say what a waste why why did you pour the whole thing out because you realize to anoint somebody doesn't take a whole box of precious ointment it only takes a little bit i mean a box of precious ointment could anoint thousands maybe 500 maybe 1500 i don't know but it could anoint more than one person so it looked like an absolute waste when she broke it and poured it all out and they begin to criticize the woman for doing that but jesus says don't say leave her alone she is anointing me for my burial she's anointing me for my burial none of you understand what she's doing and she may not even understand what she's doing but there's some force some power some anointing moving her perfectly in the will of god without a bible verse without jesus himself telling her to do it that god was anointing and moving upon this woman and she was in the flow of the word she was moving in step with the word and she broke she may not have understood clearly why but something compelled her to pour out the oil amen and he says she's anointing me for my burial why because they buried him quickly and on the sabbath day they put together all the spices to anoint his body but he rose before the women ever put it on him this is the woman that anointed him for burial because the normal process was going to be broken did she know it probably not the disciples certainly knew it but jesus christ knew why she was anointing his feet and it was a perfect worship why because it was a worship done by revelation that's what made it a perfect worship she did it by inspiration she did it by revelation i've been praying i said god let me live by revelation amen not so much form and formalism and you know i gotta have an hour of prayer time and read a chapter a day i don't mind praying an hour a day and i don't mind reading a chapter a day but i don't want formalism i want the life and i don't want to be satisfied that i checked all my boxes on religious duty that day and somehow everything's okay with me i want to be okay with me if i check none of the boxes why because i'm born again by the spirit of god by a predestinated seed of god moved and anointed by the spirit of god to move and get in action when he calls me into action not a performance but an action amen an action by the move of the holy ghost it's got to be reality we're in the day where it's got to be nothing but what was written in this bible the same kind of life the same kind of manifestation the same kind of moving by inspiration it'll never leave the word friends don't worry about that the spirit of god will never leave the word of god it'll never go beyond the word of god but it might do something you didn't expect him to do and he might do it in a way you never anticipated and it might be something you've never seen done before praise god anyhow see jesus was the master at breaking religion remember when he and his disciples were walking through the corn and they began to pluck ears and eat them i could just see him walking through and pulling a head of barley off rolling it around blowing the chaff and tossing the grain in their mouth walking along talking with jesus and going through this whole process and the pharisee says how come you let them pluck corn on the sabbath day what are you doing and jesus has to educate them in the law he wasn't going to get sucked into their trap of religion he was going to get sucked into their understanding of the sabbath and the sabbath laws all he says is didn't you read when david was hungry how he went into where the priest was and he ate the show bread that was only for the priest to eat and he gave to those that were with him and they ate too the question the the the question without being asked is how could he do that and still be righteous with god because that was for the priest only only the priest could eat the show bread but david takes it why because david was hungry and he was faint and he needed to live and the law amen god's word was not to kill man god's word was to move it was to move god it was to move man towards god and they would rather use the law to let a man starve to death with showbread sitting on the table that's what religion does to man would rather you die than touch that bread that's right there in front of you religion is dangerous and now his disciples are hungry they've been laboring they've been working with him in the ministry and they're walking through the field and they're plucking amen which is according to the law those as there's a traveler passing by in a stranger he's allowed the pluck what he can eat as he moves through not gather but pluck and eat they're not leaving the law because why they're walking with the word you think jesus is going to let them do something contrary to god's word but it might be different than their understanding of the word but it wasn't contrary to the word and he asked them what about david well of course they can't answer that because you can't make david unrighteous so he says don't you even know man was not made for the sabbath man is not the servant of the sabbath but god gave sad the sabbath for man the sabbath was instituted so man could rest not so man would become the slave of the sabbath but because of religion they reversed the original purpose that god had made a sabbath for and instead of giving a man rest and refreshment and strength they used it they would have used it to take away strength and refreshing from the disciples oh let jesus christ break religion now just god just break it away from me and let me just follow after you let me see your word the way you intended it to be seen every every word every every ordinance every article every bit of the word let me see it the way you intended it to be seen not the way man through his mind interprets the word but the way you intended it to be praise god when jesus had a multitude follow him out to the wilderness he asked the disciples he says hey um we're going to get bread that we can feed them well i mean obviously there's no store there's nothing with them philip asks i mean a logical question i mean he says 200 penny worth of bread it will suffice where would we get that jesus is trying to get his disciples to move away from reasoning move away from reasoning and he says he said this to prove them because he already knew what he would do see jesus is never without a plan yeah several weeks ago we talked about getting up to the red sea brother bam says he's not a bad general he just looked like a bad general but really and looking like a bad general proved he was the best general of all because pharaoh the general of his army says oh they've entangled themselves in the wilderness now they're trapped now i'm going to go wipe them out because he thought he was a smart duck and he thought hey the pillar of fire was a bad general not realizing that the pillar of fire had outsmarted him again and god will make things look bad because what is he doing he's outsmarting satan again and outsmarting him again and again and again and again and again and he does it through weakness and he does it through humility and he does it through inability and he does it when you hit a dead-end road and there's no place to go he opens up a way where there seems to be no way [Music] why because he's the master at war he's the master general so he calls him and says feed them he already knew what he was going to do he always has a plan hey rest assured he always has a plan no matter what happens he's always got a plan what what are you going to do 200 penny worth it's not sufficient then andrew as a genius he says well we've got some fishes and loaves but then he says but what are these amongst so many it was reasoning and i don't blame him and i'm not mad at him for it and i don't think he's a bad believer but you realize it was reasoning he was limited in his thinking by reasoning philip was limited in his thinking by reasoning but he says what are these among so many and jesus says that's enough make them sit down bring them to me everything's going to be just fine and you begin to break and break and break and break he lets us get in these positions to break our reasoning he lets us get into hopeless places to break us away from human reasoning oh like i said i wish that there was a key that i could stick in my ear and turn and shut off reasoning i wish i had the ability to shut off my own thinking and to shut off reasoning amen and just turn it off so i can just hear god's voice only and none other that's all i want but god is learning to us to fight that reasoning and to push it back that's the thing we have to overcome he's not going to shut it off he's going to give us his word he's going to move on us by the spirit and we've got to we've got to take it and move forward praise god let's let's turn to the book of job i want to switch gears and look at job for just a few minutes job chapter 1. i want to read this quote first 1963 awakening jesus could you imagine job enjoying being broke out with boils no i can't imagine him enjoying that could you imagine joe being broke out with boils and all these things gone losing all of his wealth and his children and everything it wasn't very easy but god was proving to satan that he had somebody he could put confidence in maybe he's trying to do the same thing in your case and the rest of you oh they'll forsake you they'll oh no job they couldn't make job do that no sir he's only trying to prove them remember in a few minutes he said oh you have little faith couldn't you understand about breaking the bread and feeding five thousand don't you know i'm the same jehovah that fed them for 40 years out in the wilderness out of ovens out of heaven when i poured it out every night what are you scared about don't you know i dried up the red sea one day don't you know i opened the earth and swallowed the unbeliever one day i measured the earth and spurred it off out in space yonder and he's in the ship now that's not mythical that's the truth same now he tries to prove us and see where we'll stand or not take a revival away start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do god would do that god would take a revival away i thought god only gave revival i didn't know god was in the habit of taking them away i thought the devil took it away and god gave it guess what god can give a revival and satan can give a revival it depends on what the revival's about that's right hey amen amen we've got to have we've got to have the mind of christ we've got to be led by the spirit of god amen just because something sweeps through god god can give a revival but satan can give a revival but i only want the one god gives can god take away a revival yep god can take away a revival so he said he'll take away a revival start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do that's why when things happen don't jump on it so quick when things begin to and there's a murmur or you hear a complaint or one person's grumbling in another don't jump on it so quick just hold steady maybe god's just doing a little testing amen to see amen to see if he can mature as believers and see where the character is amen maybe he'll allow a little murmur a little complain a little rumor to spread a little hey did you hear amen don't jump on that so quick and don't repeat it so fast maybe just watch that thing and say hey i hey i've seen this before this isn't my first time around the horn i jumped on one one time and it let me look like a fool sometimes god will let that happen just to see what you'll do turn satan loose among you not god he wouldn't turn satan loose among you have you ever read the bible you think you think god didn't know the serpent was in the garden you think that escaped his knowledge you think you think that he never heard the conversation he had with eve praise be to god turn saint louis among you see to see how you'll stand let him strike you with something see what kind of stand you'll take job said though he slayed me yet i'll trust him amen amen that's it let's look at job chapter six or chapter one sorry verse six job chapter one verse six now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job thank you lord amen you realize satan was not mentioning job to god job was safe he had his home his children his business his reputation everything was fine with job and satan was not accusing job to god satan wasn't asking to try him satan wasn't even mentioning his name it was god who mentioned job to satan praise me to god he said the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and askew with evil then satan answered the lord and said the job fear god for not has not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord do you realize when he says does he serve you for not you've hedged him about and protected him and everything's safe you realize that's how job wanted it hedged about protected on a hedge that god put around me that's where job wanted to be that's where i want to be where do you want to be do you want to be hedged in or unhedged amen he's hedged in does he not fear you for nothing he's hedged in amen but you remove the hedge and let me touch him amen let me take all that he has and he'll curse you and god said okay i'll take the hedge down so that you can get to him oh man it was a good thing job wasn't standing there during this conversation i could just see him over in the corner excuse me i have an objection your honor but god designed it this way why he wanted to prove job to satan this this contest was between god and satan amen job was just the battlefield but the battle was between god and satan he gets over here uh let's go down and read verse 20 in the same chapter then job arose he lost everything i mean he lost everything even his children all died and job arose and ran his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked i came into my i came of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord and all this job said not nor charged god foolishly i say god help me that's the way i want to live my life help me learn let's look over here at chapter 2 verse 1. again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto saint from whence cometh thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in him and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job he just passed the test so his reward another one see nothing works the way we think we always think i pass the test i get the merit badge i've got a trophy now everything's fine i proved i was a son of god and god's not gonna let anything else bad happen to me but that's not the way it ever works it's never worked that way don't expect it to ever work that way our expectation should be that god wants to prove to satan as bride is not like eve that she'll not fail by the word amen if god that's god's desire in this evil age and satan seemed to prove to satan that she's not like eve then god is going to prove to satan she's not like eve it'll prove it today and he'll prove it tomorrow he'll prove it the next day and the week after that and the next month because that's what he wants to do in this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve and if that's god's purpose then we better get with the program because that's the program and if that's the program he'll allow one thing to strike after another after another to prove to satan she is not like eve so let's not act like eve and fall back on reasoning amen hold your place here let's go back to genesis chapter 3. let's just come fresh i just got to hit it right now chapter 3 this is the temptation of eve verse 4 and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat i want to look at this verse six carefully when the woman saw the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes tree to be desired to make one wise she took you realize from eve's vantage point with human reasoning when she looked at the tree of good and evil now you have to realize it's good and evil and if god calls it good there's good there i mean really good god didn't call it's not fake good if god said it's good it's good if he said it's evil it's evil so it's a mixtree of mixed good and evil but the serpent when he got her to look at it and she began to look at it she could only see the good and the good was really good do we understand that she wasn't looking at evil there was good there but there was also evil it was mixed together and when she looked at this she said it was pleasant to the eyes good for food a tree to make one wise and she took an eight but god had said don't eat it so what did she fall back on was it the word of god or reasoning she trusted her eyesight she trusted her reasoning she trusted her understanding she trusted her intellect and she took a good hard look at that tree and she inspected that tree and she saw that the tree was good for food and it was a desirable tree and to make one wise and she looked at it and with her reasoning and her understanding and her intellect she couldn't see a problem and when she couldn't see a problem she left the word of god trusting in her reasoning and partook of the tree this bride won't do that there's coming a time where this bride won't do that any longer i should say it that way amen we failed by that and failed by that but there's coming a time that this bride is going to be so removed from reasoning from her eyes from her intellect from her ears from the reasoning and understanding of everyone around her to where she looks at it and you can say yeah it looks good but the word says tell me what's wrong with that i can't see anything wrong the way you explain it makes sense to me i understand what you're saying it's very reasonable but the word says [Applause] we've got to get to that place where it's what the word says but this and this and you understand this and if you take it from this angle but the prophet of god told us thus saith the lord dust us and us i i understand and i don't fault you for going that way but i can't go that way because i don't want to cross this line of the word i'm standing on the word and if this is what the prophet said thus saith the lord i'm standing on it because he was a vindicated prophet yes what you say sounds good what you say looks good i agree with you i don't i can't explain to you anything bad about it but god said and i'm staying with what god said oh i'm a fool for christ which is the anointing the word whose full are you brother i say got to be a fool for somebody might as well be a fool for the world they won't understand you can't explain it amen you can't get anybody else to understand it but the word says and i'm standing on the word because i know it won't fail and sometimes when you stand on the word it looks like it fails you realize job did nothing wrong job was standing on the word the revealed word for his day was a sacrifice an atonement a covering for his sin and he stood completely amen on that word justified by his faith in the word for his hour and he knew that it worked and he believed in it he never doubted that word and god said he's perfect and there's none like him on the earth but what did his perfection get him what did his standing on the word amount to what did his perfect life come to when god himself could stand before satan and god who never lies could say he's perfect there's nothing wrong with him there's nothing like him what did all of that perfection and all that perfect life and all that faith did him it got him death for all of his children seven sons and three daughters it it got him the loss of all of his material goods it got him the contention of his wife and eventually got him broke out with boils from the soles of his feet to the top of his head that's what a perfect life got him you realize we're living the life for god not for our material gain and not for our benefit but because we love him amen because we want to serve him because we've been put on this earth to be for his purpose to manifest his life and if he's going to manifest his life through first covering me in boils then that's exactly what it's got to be friends what was the reward of his living the life and believing the word it was a trial like none other had gone through that was his reward see reasoning is not going to work reasoning will never work it doesn't make sense my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways you tell me how you could ever justify in human reasoning that it means like your child you come to your child you say guess what you have made your bed perfect every day this week and you did all of your math lessons and all of your school perfect 100 on everything and i haven't had to remind you one time to do what i asked you to do and you even did above and beyond you did extra and you followed my word perfectly oh i'm so happy now let's go to the bedroom and we'll give you a spanking what you understand friends that's what job got that's exactly what job got but job said god giveth and he taketh away blessed be the name of the lord job was learning to trust god we're back here in chapter 2. he again mentions job verse 3 and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and skew with evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone in his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so he goes down and he breaks him out with boils let's read it here verse seven so it went satan forth with present from the presence of the lord and smote job was sore boiled from the soul of his foot into his crown and he took him a pot shirt to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes then said his wife and him dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil we'll take as good will we not take his evil will we only receive blessings will we not receive cursings that's a good question will we only receive good will we not also receive the evil go ask that in the denominational church [Music] but the question is a good one for us we want god always to give blessings always to do good and sometimes the good thing that he's doing looks bad sometimes what we would call evil is something god's working for good and we've got to be willing to take both why because he's our father and he knows we've got to have confidence in him he said let's read that again what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips i said oh god help me help me help me help me lord brother branham said in the reaction to an action from 59 god tests like job they accused him that he was a secret sinner and job was righteous there was no man on earth like him and yet god let the devil take everything he had and when they accused him of being a secret sinner he knew that he was righteous before god he knew he had done no sin but god lets those things happen to see what you'll do you see and he and satan had a proposition satan said i'll make him curse you to your face god said you can't do it and the test had to come and your test comes and my test comes and we all go through those testings the bible said if we cannot stand that it proves that we are illegitimate children our testimony was not right we're not real children of god but we become illegitimate we're not the children of god we just claim to be when the test comes and we forget god and we forget who we are and we lose all hope and faith that proves we weren't who we said we were right that's a big statement in the message look from 1963 he says job when even all of his friends had turned him down everything was wrong job kept looking towards the sky somebody said you're a secret sinner you're looking job what are you looking up that way for because you've done sin god has done prove that he's what he's done to you you're a secret sinner job job knowed he wasn't a sinner he had met exactly every word god required that burnt sacrifice what was job looking at job wasn't looking so much at his conduct as he was looking at his faith in the word of god god had required a burnt sacrifice and he had offered a burnt sacrifice and that was an atonement for our sins and so he was righteous and sin free not because he never made a mistake but because he had faith in what god told him to do to atone for his sins it was his faith in the revealed word for his day that job had and job was resting confidently in that he could answer down his friends who would come to me had three friends who come to them and begin all to accuse him saying now job now why don't you just go ahead and admit it why don't you just go ahead and fess up to what you've done because god doesn't do this to people unless they've done wrong oh praise god help us never to be guilty of that same kind of accusing spirit when we see a brother or sister going through something difficult don't you automatically assume they're wrong before god that might be good evidence they're perfect and upright and and perfect in all other ways don't be one of job's friends come on job come on god will not receive a hypocrite that's why these problems are happening to you there's no come on job you can't fool us we know all about god we're the experts on god nothing's changed nothing's changed every spirit that was alive then is alive now the spirits that were against job then are against the bride now job now we know all about god and i can tell you for sure that god doesn't do these things to somebody who's righteous you've got sin in your life what a friend come on job now you keep justifying yourself and you keep saying there's nothing wrong with you job wasn't looking at his conduct he was looking at the burnt sacrifice job was looking at the word of god amen you could job didn't say job was not saying i've never told a lie i haven't ever been mean to my wife i never did a bad business deal he wasn't saying that he was saying i'm righteous because he told me to offer a sacrifice i offered a sacrifice i did what he said to do i believed his word i fully believed his word and operated in it i'm clean from all of my sin can we have that same kind of confidence when bad things happen to us can we look back on our life and say i fully believe the word i believed this message with all my heart i stood on and everything he said did i did it with everything i know to do if there's something i did wrong it wasn't in my knowledge because i fully believed the word and stood upon it if we can get to that place then we can just stand still and see the salvation of god because god's doing something amen he knowed he wasn't a sinner he had met exactly every word god required the burnt sacrifice that burnt offering was all god asked for god only asked for the burnt offering and job knowed he had made the burnt offering sacrifice god only asked you to believe his word amen he don't ask all those isms and creeds and everything else he asked you to believe him and believing him is the sign of righteousness he says in the message recognizing your day and its message from 1964 job never recognized that it was god as long as the devil can make you believe sometime that the little trials you go through is god's punishing you oh praise be to god as long as the devil can make you believe sometime that the little trials you go through is god punishing you it was god trying to show him something it wasn't a punishment god was trying to sow him something job never recognized it till he saw a vision like moses when moses saw the vision the pillar of fire in the bush it was vindicated job in his question see job had a question see the whole time that god is in this contest with satan have you considered job he's perfect there's none like him on the earth he says oh if you do this and this he said go ahead and see he doesn't he comes back and says hey try him again i mean did you still consider him look you even tried to destroy him you moved me against him and he didn't sin he says do him again because god knew down in job's heart was a question job wasn't a sinner job wasn't a center he wasn't off the word but down in his heart was a question and god wanted to answer the question so you realize whenever something hits when trials hit god's doing many things at the same time god can accomplish many purposes with the same trial god is showing and proving i have an elect seed who will stand on my word to say there's a contest between god and satan and god is going to win this contest because he knows what's in job but he also knows down job as a question a question about the resurrection a question about hey you know i see a tree go down and come up i see a flower go down but what about man he goes into darkness and never sees light again and god is in a contest with satan but also going to answer job's question all at the same time not because job's a sinner but because job's a son it was god trying to show him something job never recognized it till he saw a vision like moses when moses saw the vision the pillar of fire in the bush it was vindicated job in his question if a man dies can he live again i see a tree die it lives again i see a flower dies it lives again that was his question but man layth down and giveth up the goat he wasted the way his sons come to mourn and perceive it not he perceive it not and that thou would hide me in the grave until thy wrath has passed he couldn't understand why a flower would die and live again how a leaf would go off a tree down and lay on the ground and come back again in the spring he said man layth down and where does he go i believe god but what happens to a man but then one day the lightning began to flash the thunders began to roar the spirit came upon the prophet and he saw the coming of a man who would put his hand upon a sinful man and a holy god and bridge the way then he screamed i know my redeemer liveth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god he recognized what the resurrection was god was in a contest with satan but he was also going to teach something to a son that would help the son overcome his question and job was willing to rejoice let's look at job 40 let's turn over to chapter 40. job has this discourse with his three friends and the scripture says they came from a long way they gathered together to comfort job that was their purpose to comfort him and in comforting him they began to accuse him of being a sinner and no doubt they thought they were doing him a favor because if they could just get him to confess this trial would end like if you just fess up to what you did wrong if you just a fess up to being a hypocrite if you would just tell us all you've lived a double life i'm sure god would take all this away and everything would be fine but you realize that they had another motive because the scripture says he was the greatest man of the east he was the greatest man of the east and these friends come to him to comfort him but they never speak one word of comfort all they speak is accusation you know why because they weren't the greatest man in the east that's exactly why there was envy in their heart and all they could do was accuse him point out possible problems and possible failures possible hypocrisy see the devil plays on all of our emotions and he creates envy and he creates pride takes pride and envy and does all he does to separate fellowship and say god don't ever let me be like that let me love my brother truly and genuinely but job also had a question in his heart so the friends they had a problem job had a question god had a battle with his enemy how many things is god accomplishing in one trial he's doing it all don't ever don't ever get to the place where you see a try and say oh god was doing that for that purpose that might have been one of many and don't don't come to the conclusion too quick amen chapter 40 verse 1 now uh these three friends speak and job contest with them and it's not a pleasant conversation and then elihu speaks and elieu is in the place of god brother bram said he's the type of christ and he begins to set job straight when he sets soap job straight he's teaching job a lesson because job had been complaining job wasn't a sinner he didn't sin against god he was a perfect and upright man but when he hit his trial he started saying oh i hate the day i was born i wish that i'd never come forth from the womb i wish that i i was cast forth and i was buried as a baby and i never saw the light of day and i could rest under the ground what was he doing he was complaining in the midst of his trial he wasn't a sinner he wasn't unrighteous he believed the word but when it got hot and heavy he started saying i hate the day i was born i wish i had never been conceived all made dark be the night where they said a man child is conceived oh i wish i could say i've never done that i wish i could say i was more righteous than job but i've i've cried the same tears and believed the same thing and said it's too much for me it would be better if i were dead and job never should have done that because job was in the place of god and job was a tool god was using to fight his enemy and he was fulfilling god's purpose but in fulfilling god's purpose he was saying i wish i had never been born i wish i could have just laid and died i wish i would have never been conceived and this is going on with his battle with his friends and his friends have their own thing going on and he's got his own thing going on and god's answering a question and he's complaining and elihu comes and sets him straight and says hey you better not be complaining god is god and everything he does is righteous and don't you be whining and job started saying this is not fair i mean that's not an exact quote you can go and read it but what he's saying is this isn't fair i haven't done anything wrong this isn't fair and i wish i could say i've never said that either but i'm just as guilty amen he's saying this isn't fair i didn't do anything wrong i don't deserve this this ain't fair he said i don't know why god is doing this and ellie you ellie begins to rebuke him and say are you making god unrighteous i mean you're saying you didn't do anything wrong and this isn't fair are you making god unrighteous and unjust be careful he wasn't wrong in saying he didn't sin there was nothing wrong with that he wasn't a sinner he could say i'm a believer but to say this isn't fair now we've got a problem now he's sideways making an accusation against the righteousness of god when we get a trial we got to be careful friends we don't complain don't start throwing out complaints and don't start saying this isn't fair i've always paid my tithes why am i having a financial problem i gave more than ten percent i paid tithes and i gave offer god this isn't fair you better be careful because what you're doing is accusing god of being unrighteous and we've got to say god whatever you do is perfect though you slay me let yeah will i serve you so elieu becomes comes to set him straight and after ellie who speaks here comes god in a whirlwind and it says moreover the lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile why shall i answer thee i will lay my hand upon my mouth once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare that unto me will thou also disannulle my judgment will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous he's asking him oh you're complaining all you're saying is not fair all you're saying you didn't do anything wrong you don't know why god's letting this happen to you are you disannulling my judgment and he asked another good question here will thou condemn me that you will be righteous will you condemn me so you can look righteous job wasn't a sinner job wasn't an unbeliever but in his complaining he was stepping too far he said god help me never to complain again amen help me god please help me chapter 42 god speaks again job's going to give another answer then job answered the lord and said i know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not here i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare that unto me i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my eye seeth thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent and dust and ashes job just got put back in his place who can say it's not fair who can say it's not right who can say this shouldn't be happening to me how can you say those things just we've got to let god be god no more it's not fair no moreness isn't right no more but just saying god i don't understand but i trust you it doesn't make sense to my mind but i believe you anyhow and i know i fully believed your word i know i have fully trusted in you and i'm going to rest and wait for you to show me whatever you want to show me teach me lord and have your way in me now job had a question god was going to answer satan wanted to prove himself or god wanted to prove himself to satan so we have the satan showdown between god and satan you have the lesson of job then you have the envy of the three friends and then you have job whining and getting corrected i think there's a lot happening in this trial i think the trial has something for everyone brother bam says show us the father 1961. even it's the oldest book in the bible job when he was broke out with boils looked like everything had gone against him and his christian or his religious friend said job you've done evil many people want to say because somebody's sick that they did evil that's not the truth job was a perfect man god said so but sometimes god lets affliction hit his people to test him for their faith he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner oh can we let this be true can we let it be true in us and can we let it be true in somebody else like we want it to be true in us but can it be true for somebody else he said he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner and god does that to test now let's look at job 13. and i want to look at chapter 13 for a second and look at job's answer to his friends this is another place i really started laughing hard today chapter 13 look at verse one lo mine eye has seen all this mine here has heard and understood it they keep telling him stuff that he already knows god doesn't accept a sinner god doesn't address a hypocrite and i mean he said and job is saying my eye has seen all this my ear hath heard and understand it what ye know the same do i know also i'm not inferior to you surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with god but you are forgers of lies you are physicians of no value that's when i really got a good chuckle you come to comfort me and be a physician and heal me you're physicians of no value i already know what you know i already know god judges sinners i already know god doesn't accept grace but but that doesn't explain my situation because i'm not a sinner and i'm not a hypocrite i know what you know i've seen what you said i've heard what you've heard i'm not inferior to you i want god to speak to me you are forgers of lies and you are physicians of no value you're worthless i said god i don't ever want to be a physician of no value when i see a friend or somebody in a trial i don't want to be that kind of a physician but god knows how to correct his children it's not up to me to correct his children amen if i see a brother amen regardless of what i think god is able to instruct a brother i'm just there to be a brother why can't we just pour the oil in why is it we always have to have the answer why can't we just pray for one another why can't we just support one another why do we always have to prove that we know the most and we know why you're going through a trial and we know exactly why this is happening and i can answer on behalf of god god got angry with those three friends because he says do you speak on my behalf as if we know why god's doing everything he's doing as if i can say this is happening because of this and this is the reason because of that physicians of no value can't we just pour the oil in and say i love you brother i'm praying for you you know by saying to a brother i see you're in a trial i love you be of good cheer god's just testing you'll come through the test god will prevail maybe god wants to teach them something maybe there's something wrong he's going to correct but do you really know what it is i don't want to be one of the three friends of job because god rebuked them sharply he wasn't pleased with their all-knowing all-understanding speaking on his behalf giving job the reasons why he's going through a trial and they were completely 100 wrong even though the things they said were exactly true they were true they were speaking truth if you look at the things that they say in their discourses those verses are quoted elsewhere in the psalms and even jesus will quote what the friends are saying because they're speaking truth but they're misapplying the truth to job that's why he says you're forgers of lies not because they weren't speaking the truth what they said was true but when they said job was a sinner they now were a liar he says now god doesn't accept a sinner you're a sinner that made them a liar but saying god doesn't accept a sinner is true so much so that david would quote eliphaz in the psalms it was truth but it was truth misapplied to a son of god just because we know the truth and know the scriptures doesn't mean we've got that we know what god's doing what's wrong with saying i love you brother and i'm sorry for what you're going through i'm going to pray for you and may god deliver you amen as if somehow if we do that we remove the rod we're not the ones with the rod the great shepherd is the one with the rod if the rod's going to come down the rod's going to come down regardless of what you say why can't we just say god bless you brother i'm sorry i'll be praying for you may god help you why can't we be a physician of value and let god be the judge and let god do what he's going to do why can't we just have brotherly kindness and love each other what happened to brotherly kindness you know if you don't have brotherly kindness you'll never have capstone love and if we can't have brotherly kindness forget the capstone friends somehow we feel like if i'm nice to this brother and i think he's made a mistake and if i show love somehow i've taken away god's judgment you can't take away god's judgment are you a better judge than god are you a better at afflicting the right kind of punishment than god i say if we're going to make a mistake let's make the mistake on the side of love and give too much give too much love too much brotherly kindness too much forgiveness too much benefit of the doubt too much believing in a brother too much just assuming he's okay with god i want to err that way let me just assume everything's fine with him of god god will take care of the rest i don't think god will fault me for assuming he's fine i don't think god's going to look down at me with anger for saying i love my brother god i pray that you bless him even if what god's doing is punishing him if i still pray for his blessing i don't think god's going to be angry with me why because i'm not god and i don't know so if i have to make an assumption why is it always easier to assume the evil why can't we just assume the good you know we do this with our friends all the time you find out somebody tells you your friend did something you assume automatically he didn't do it because i know his character and you later may find out he did do it but your first assumption is he didn't but when somebody tells you something about somebody you don't like you automatically assume it's true that's flawed humanity but that's not the nature of god why is it so easy to believe something bad about somebody you don't like but it's so hard to believe bad stuff about somebody you do like do you think that's righteous judgment that's the fallacy of mankind i say god help me to love my brothers whether they're an heir or not merit help me to love them amen and i want to assume the best somebody tells you something about a brother assume it's wrong assume it's wrong until it's been proven that's what the bible tells us to do assume it's wrong assume the best believe for the best believe in your brothers and sisters and believe that they're righteous and holy and god loves them and everything's just fine and don't worry if something's got to be exposed god will expose it he doesn't need you to be the all-wise one to help him he'll do it so job this is job's good advice and i'd like to take it home for us be for but ye are forgers of lies you are all physicians of no value oh that you would all together hold your peace it should and it should be your wisdom amen that's good advice friends let's just take it home to ourselves amen your physicians of no value all that you would just hold your peace and be quiet it would be counted unto you for wisdom you'd look a whole lot smarter than you look now that's actually what he's saying amen i say god make me a physician of value amen i want to be an instrument of healing not punishment i want to be an instrument of love not hate i want to promote a brother not be jealous of a brother and have to pull him down i want to be any brother that i'm around i want to see if we can get them higher and higher that's what the bible says honor them amen esteem them greater than yourself that's the bible why is it so hard to do that when they see job the greatest man because god made him the greatest man all of a sudden when he's in trouble they can't wait to get to him and say it's because you're wrong here you're wrong you're wrong here you're wrong here why because we would be living in 2020 and we'll do the same thing today that they did back then what a lesson for us i don't ever want to be that way amen i'd rather come to job and say job i'm praying that you come out of this greater than when you came in i pray that god will bless you more i pray that you're you're you'll increase in every way because that's exactly what god did he got double of everything he lost [Applause] and if you would be talking to him like that you would be on god's side amen let's jump over here to back to 42. after god's done with job he turns to eliphaz the first of the three friends verse seven and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job has therefore taken to you now seven bulldogs and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly and that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job god knew exactly what their problem was their problem was envy and when god deals with the problem they jumped on job when job was down boy that's brave they got on job when job was down but then when god corrects them he says you've not spoken to me the thing that's right that was your own doing and now to be right with me you've got to humble yourself to the one that you've been accusing all this time oh god knows exactly how to fix us rotten human beings he knows how to hit us where it hurts the worst he knows how to bring shame in a basis and he knows how to fix the problem [Music] i said god help me help me help me help me i don't want to be like job's friends i don't want to be a whiner like job i just want to believe your word i want to be like job at the end of his trial i put my hand over my mouth i've spoken once and i won't do it again i spoke twice but never never again oh if we could just get there right now god teach me this lesson now god before the next trial hits teach me this lesson right now i just want to be quiet and i want to trust you quietly and if i say anything i want to say something that's in the word like i know my redeemer liveth nothing else god's promises are true nothing else not this isn't fair i don't know why this is happening god knows god knows i paid my tithe god knows i did right like are you mad at god please don't be don't be upset at him don't accuse him just say hey bless god praise the lord he's perfect in all of his ways and then put your hand back over your mouth and if you ever take your hand off of your mouth just take your hand off your mouth to praise him and then put your hand back over your mouth i want to be where job ended amen and i don't ever want to be like job's friends i want to be a physician with real value to my brothers and sisters guess what do you think things are going to get easier do you think trials are going to get less frequent that's not my expectation and do you think once the media starts getting involved that they'll always report the truth about your brother or sister amen what if the news got involved and something happened something happened in the church or something happened the news got involved do you think they would tell it exactly right and do you think that would be a challenge to all other message believers what if you hear over new zealand such and such happen with this pastor or what if you hear up in russia such and such happened with this church or what if you're here i don't care what you hear believe for the best believe they're a child of god believe everything's fine believe they're fine between god because how in the world are you ever going to know anyhow they're in russia they're in new zealand they're in south africa they're who knows where they're at don't ever believe evil about a brother or sister believe the best and if you need to know something god will make sure you thoroughly know it and when you thoroughly know it then you know what to do next but if you don't know and there's no way for you to know do not pass judgment just say god bless my brother i've heard he's in trouble i've heard there's a problem in the church i've heard that there's an investigation i heard that there's this and i heard there's that god will you help my brother will you bless them will you bring them through this if they're wrong will you show them so they can be corrected if it's just evil against them will you shield them from all evil were you bringing themselves greater than they went in will you bless them abundantly will you give back to them double all that they had can we pray that kind of prayer i think that's what god wants in this hour he wants his bride to come together and not to be divided and not to be so envious and jealous and poking at one another and believing evil about one another we should believe only good about one another [Music] amen god be praised let reasoning die god's proving his bride and he'll use negative news to prove his bride he'll he'll put you in the place of one of job's friends just to see what you'll do he'll put you in the place of job to see what you'll do you can be in either place you can be in the trial or you can be the friend and god's watching what we'll do whether you're in the trial or whether you're the friend god's watching what we're going to do and god cares about what we say he cares about how we react it's not it's not the problem that's the problem it's the reaction to the problem that's the problem god will let the problem to check the reaction to the problem i say god give me your character and let me die to everything else the tests are going to get harder the news is going to get worse and social media is not the place to find out the true story social media is not the place to get the scoop but you just believe the best it all sounds bad how do you really know well so-and-so said so-and-so said they heard from so and so that's not good information that's not even biblical we're not supposed to judge a matter of what we get off facebook or instagram or whatsapp that's not how we judge a matter that's not scriptural for righteous judgment you can't judge it from afar you can't judge it from a text you can't judge it from a post i say if i do anything let me say god i want you to bless my brother they're in some sort of trouble would you help my brother and call them a brother call them a sister when you go to the throne of god because you've got no reason to believe they're not all of this nonsense of trying to decide who's bright and who's not bright forget it all call him brother call him sister brother branham could look down at the worst of the worst of denominational rooted in their denomination refusing to leave and he say brother so and so how can we not call somebody else in the message brother and sister when brother branham will call a catholic man brother i think god needs to give us all a good spanking and put us back on the right track so we can have the right kind of love for our brothers and sisters the right kind of attitude towards every situation that we can be found fighting for the right and never found fighting against god please god i don't ever want to fight against god i always want to be on the side of right and the only thing i know to do is believe the best pray for my brother and pray that god for my brother says that god will work it all out and god will bless him abundantly after it's all over and he'll take care of the rest why do you think trials come to prove us why do you think something comes what happens if something bad happens to a brother or sister sitting right next to you it's to prove you too it's to prove them but it's also to prove you what if you hear something about a brother i can't believe that i've been to church with him for 20 years i can't believe that's true it's not just to test him it's to test you too to see what you'll do i say god let me be a physician with value and help me never to be a forger of lies and if i can't do anything else let me keep quiet and shut my mouth for then it would be accounted to me for wisdom and not open my mouth and prove what a fool i really am but to shut my mouth at least somebody will think i'm wise even if i'm not that's what the proverb says god bless you saints god's teaching us how to endure trials by what by trials and are they getting easier who would say that your trials are easier now than they were a couple years ago nope i don't have any takers on that they're getting harder why because he's bringing his bride into perfection have we failed absolutely have we done like job yep have we done like job's friends yep are we guilty every one of us i've seen god i've heard him speak and i'm a based and ashamed of myself and i bore myself that's a good place to be friends that's not bad can god work with that yes he can he blessed job because of it and job got back double i say we're learning how to be like christ this bride is learning to have the character of christ on display in every trial and they're not going to get easier they're going to get harder why because he chose this evil age to call a bride for his name because he wants to prove to satan she's not like eve she won't fall back on reasoning her own ideas her own thinking her own judgment but she will stand on this word in the word only god bless you friends let's stand musicians if you'd come i want to read one scripture while we're standing i just had you stand so you pay attention to me for a few more minutes i want to read romans chapter 8. romans 8 and 31 what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect help me god not to ever ever do that because the blood of jesus christ has freed them and the foreknowledge of god has chosen them help me never to lay a charge to god's elect because if i do that i'm on the same side satan's on because he's an accuser of the brother and help me god never to be an accuser of the brethren who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord so we're in a hard trial so what can it separate us from the love of god has it changed anything in the mind of god has it changed the word one iota has it changed god's plan no we're in a hard trial has anything changed nothing has changed if anything we've just he's revealing himself to us and we're learning more and more we're growing and increasing in our understanding of him brother ben says in the smyrna church age out of the church age book the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass i love god that doesn't prove nothing you can shout it on the housetop you can tell your neighbor i love god that doesn't prove nothing but how do i prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst the trial that he and his wisdom allows to come my way that's how i prove my love to him not by saying it not by shouting it not by writing it in a paper that doesn't prove nothing the proving of my love to him is conducting myself with joy amidst the trial that he has allowed to come my way i pray i tell you it's easier to tell a co-worker than to conduct ourselves with joy in the trial it's easier to shout out from a houndstop it's easier to spray paint it on a bridge it's easier to put it on a bumper sticker than it is to conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of the trial that he and his wisdom allowed to come our way i said god i desire in my heart to prove my love to you help me lord help me to put my hand over my mouth unless i can say i love you unless i can say thank you first thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give thanks in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you unless i can say in the middle of a trial thank you jesus i'd like to keep my hand over my mouth and when my brother's in a trial unless i can be a physician of value and say i love you brother i'm praying for you i want to keep my hand over my mouth keep quiet so that i can appear wise i don't want to know the word i want to be the word i don't want to know about god i want to be the manifestation of god i don't want to know the word i want the word living in me i want the word changing my behavior changing my conduct changing my speech i want to be the living word on display and how can i do it if i'm doing everything opposite to what he told us to do in his word and the way i conduct myself in a trial and the way i treat a brother in a trial i say god help us help us lord correct us make us what you want us to be amen let's sing a song in my mind fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new let me live in
