TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I started asking myself what is the bride what is the bride the bride we know the brother man asked the question what is the word bride he said the manifestation of the hour what is the bride it's the portion of the word that God once expressed in this day so it's a thought of God now expressed which is a word and it's the anointed word for the day so it's also Christ but that bride is being manifest in human vessels so I believe by faith that I'm part of the bride and the bride is being manifest through my human vessel but then I say what part of me is bride well the only part of me is bride is the soul this isn't bride my mental realm is not bride the only part of me is bride is that part that come from God the Eternal part that's down inside another Chad Lamb that may not even have the name Chad Lamb I don't even know what the name will be what do you call it in the Heavenly Realms what was it in the thoughts of God one it will be in the great Hereafter I don't know maybe it'll be Chad Lamb maybe it won't maybe we'll speak English maybe we won't the point is the the genuine thought of God concerning me amen is down in my soul and come alive amen by the spirit of God that is the bride that is my portion of bride that is the thought God had before the foundation of the world when he thought of me that's what he was thinking of Amen now that is contained in a vessel that come through sex birth through hybridization that's born wrong it has a carnal worldly spirit that part has to all change but until that change takes place the life on the inside must bring this subject to the word of God but I never must lose sight that this isn't bride or else I will start treating all of me as bride and have too much confidence and my emotions my thoughts my feelings my Sensations amen this isn't the day to be childish this is the age to grow up and have understanding
