[0:00] somewhere the prophet of God said that
[0:02] once you see this
[0:05] message you will see nothing else but
[0:09] this
[0:12] message once you seek Christ you see
[0:16] nothing else but
[0:20] Christ because you're not using this
[0:23] that ey is amen down there that's
[0:28] right it sees where nobody else is able
[0:31] to
[0:33] see he said there was never been any
[0:36] rains from
[0:38] Heavens the skies were always clear
[0:42] there were no clouds never had been a
[0:44] cloud upon the Earth why because it was
[0:48] God's program to water vegetation
[0:51] through the springs and things but Noah
[0:55] because God
[0:58] said
[1:00] that eye is connected to God's voice
[1:04] amen that eye is connected to God's
[1:10] saying and when it's connected there's a
[1:13] fear there love there because he will
[1:16] never allow anything in
[1:18] between but Noah because of because that
[1:22] God said it's going to rain he saw the
[1:25] rain coming
[1:28] 120 years before one drop
[1:33] fell it's a long range Vision yeah amen
[1:40] amen and he made preparations to get
[1:43] away to get away from
[1:46] it and ever since he heard that word
[1:49] there was something beating in his bosom
[1:54] like a
[1:55] possession it's it's going to rain it's
[1:59] going to rain
[2:00] it's going to rain so just think for 120
[2:04] years this is what was beating in in in
[2:07] Noah's
[2:10] heart even when they were inside of the
[2:13] the ark was already
[2:14] built sitting there went 7 days no drain
[2:20] even his family testing time came I can
[2:23] see no was wife said
[2:27] husband could you review that that
[2:29] message you preached it the other
[2:31] day even the
[2:33] sons yeah amen
[2:37] yes but the prophet of God said as they
[2:40] were sitting there the seventh day they
[2:42] felt something got loose in the
[2:45] bottom she was floating Noah was
[2:50] resting that eye the eye of the Lord is
[2:54] the only thing that can give you rest
[2:57] amen it shows you exactly who you are
[3:01] where you are and then you are resting
[3:05] amen
