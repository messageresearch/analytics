========================================

but we must make this place of dwelling not an outer court place or the first uh holy spirit but we must live with god in the holiest of holies a consecrated hidden line alone polite with god we become too excited upset about too many things to show there's something lacking the church ought to be a million miles up the road the water is now we're still back down in the adolescent age fussing

lord [Music] for the place that we've come from lord god by this anointed word of the hour you're lifting our amnesia till we recognize we weren't who we thought we were we were traveling through this life born of human parents living a natural life that's not who we really were but the word came and awakened us to who we really are lord where we really came from and what our destination really is lord there's such a longing in our hearts god to be unified with you in a greater way day by day word by word lord let that land be alive in us lord [Music] or let that promised land be living in our hearts may we be in communion with you may it move lord from a longing to a reality day by day give us the eye sabbath to see lord god give us the word that illuminates our path or may we walk as you walk in this life may we be what you've ordered us to be may we fulfill your purpose in our lives may you be glorified lord in all that we do in this journey for god we're walking towards you we're walking with you you're walking in us walking toward that destination but i pray you would take control of the service this morning as you've abided in the praises of your people according to your word you made your presence known god now i pray you make your presence known by the breaking of bread that you would take this word and break it for us lord for you're the great shepherd and you're the one we're looking to to feed us we come as your lambs lord eager and expectant we're hungry for more of you pray that you would provide lord the meat we have need of god we give you all glory and praise may you take preeminence and be glorified and all it's said and done in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] and god bless you it's so good to see you this morning this way god bless you brother mike i couldn't believe you turned 80. shocking news brother but you make 80 look good so praise god happy birthday let's take our bibles and turn to revelation 21. while we're still standing we'll read this and be seated amen i want to remind everybody the communion service today we'll come back for that and let you know that the fellowship hall is open if you brought something to eat and like to eat in there or go get something and bring it back it is open now and also at the end of service our sister rachel barnes is uh requested to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so we're so thankful for her she was baptized when she was younger but she can't shake the burden that she feels to recommit her life to god and do so by baptism and she knows what brother venom said there's no scriptural requirement to be baptized again she knows that and she knows she doesn't have to but there's a burden in her that desires too strongly wants to needs to for her own conscience saying and so we're happy to help her in that amen and be praying for that god will manifest all he desires to manifest in her life it's a good day amen it's been a good time for the williams family may god keep blessing them amen amen let's read revelation 21 7 together he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son amen let's just ask the lord the blessed reading of his word is receded amen i want to look at this scripture now i've read this scripture several times over the last few services so it's not new to us but you know every once in a while you get on things and thoughts and meditations and directions the lord's leading you and you just can't get off of it amen no matter no matter what you can't get off of it and you've preached it but then god drops one more nugget and then you preach it again and he drops one more nugget so we're going to be talking about things we've been talking about i mean for a little while so i don't mean to be repeating and i hope to you it doesn't come across as repeating but this is just something god is really dealing with us on and giving us direction and continually unfolding more and more as we go along and so i i pray that god will just keep dropping those nuggets so their understanding goes deeper and it becomes richer and our vision becomes clearer on everything even we've believed before amen there's still more layers to everything we believe amen there's deeper realities to everything we've accepted and so in this this scripture was one that we've talked about he that overcometh shall inherit all things and we know brother branham told us he said overcoming was not god putting you into a pipe and pulling you out the other side and saying now you're an overcomer you had nothing to overcome god did everything for you but we we realized that god gives us choice amen god never takes away choice and god is actually expressing his plan through choice and so he's called individuals and he's put he's put faith in his children remember he put faith in job he had confidence in job and he had confidence that when job was put to the test that job would not fail to believe amen and so god had confidence in job god has confidence in you and i god has confidence in our brother levi and his family right now so so we know that that god uh the promises are to the overcomer but the overcomer is not the one who has taken a a lazy approach to the gospel and just says whatever happens will happen and if god wants it it'll happen if he doesn't want it but he wants those who will make their choice amen those who will press those who will seek the lord those who will make decisions for god's sake for the word regardless of the consequences and so i was looking at this and and i want to bring this in this context uh in the breach brother branham says like jacob being supplanter and when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away he said i'm just not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted for and his name was changed from sir planter which means deceiver to what to a prince with god israel he prevailed now this is interesting in the context of what i've been meditating on and dwelling on that that you realize that jacob in a time of need in a time of trial jacob begins to move amen back towards his homeland he's being drawn back by circumstances amen he's coming back for the fulfillment of the word and he gets pressed in a tight situation and he moves by himself alone across the river and when he's there he meets a man and he wrestles with that man till the break of the day and we know that that man amen when when he leaves this wrestling match when he leaves this confrontation he walks away and says i have met god face to face so he knows something about that angel about that man that he met amen but the way brother branham says this here he says he come in contact with the angel now how was how was jacob ever going to come in contact with that angel unless that angel made contact with jacob like who made contact with who really like if you want to go make contact with an angel go find one you know go knock on the door go make one appear go go make contact with an angel amen the angel had to make himself present to jacob had to come to jacob jacob couldn't find him so that means god wanted this interaction with jacob amen it was god who initiated god who started the ball rolling god amen but there had to be something in jacob also so there had to be two parts to this scenario that we watched play out there had to be the part that jacob could not do that only god can do and there had to be the part that jacob did amen and so he said uh he held on and the angel tried the angel tried to pull away now listen the angel was trying to get away from jacob i i hope god will help me say these things right because i don't want to say anything wrong but the angel you're telling me the angel couldn't get away like he was too weak and he wasn't strong enough and didn't have supernatural powers to pull away from jacob he was pulling away and he even says let me go amen and jacob says i will not let you go this whole scenario is playing out for a purpose friends amen the the the the angel is not able to pull away from jacob and listen i'm just going to share it just the best i know how i don't believe the angel was not pulling away from jacob because he was physically incapable of pulling away from jacob but i believe the angel couldn't pull away from jacob because of who jacob was not because of jacob's physical strength but because of who jacob was and what jacob represented and what jacob was coming to amen and now jacob got a hold of the angel and the angel couldn't pull away i don't think jacob was so physically strong that he could grab a hold of this supernatural being and the supernatural being could not physically get away i don't think it was a test of strength amen i think it was the position jacob held with god that gave him the strength to hold on to that angel let's look at hosea 12 if we could turn together i want to look at a couple scriptures there's quite a few scriptures i want to go through daniel then hosea i say that for my benefit not yours i have a hard time sometimes finding the books hosea chapter 12. and we're going to start at verse 2. and the lord also had controversy with judah and will punish jacob according to his ways according to the doings will he recompense him he took his brother by the heel in the womb we know jacob did when esau was born he come out holding on to his heel and that's how he got the name jacob or sir planter and so it says here he had power i'm sorry he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with god think about that by his strength he had power with god yeah he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in bethel and there he spake with us so i want to focus on he had power with god and i want to take out of this a text for tonight power with god he had power with god he had power over the angel and prevailed i don't know about you but something about that statement is so so impactful to me that jacob we know jacob as a human being a man born in an earthly way that jacob he had power with god and jacob had power over the angel and prevailed let's go to genesis chapter 32. and look at this genesis 32 and 24 this is the story of jacob coming back into the land genesis 32 and 24. and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hall of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said that thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou just asked after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place pineal for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penul the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not of the sin which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank so now he's wrestling with this angel and this angel touches him and die and he cripples him he he as a physical uh fact it cripples jacob and and jacob is wrestling and he says let me go for it's the break of day he said i will not let you go till you bless me now we know afterwards jacob says i have met god face to face so what is this telling us about jacob who he's wrestling with who touched him and who he said i will not let you go until you bless me who is he wrestling with what's taking place here what what is the impact of what is going on who what is the significance of what's happening there is a man on earth who's scared amen who's been a cheat all his life who's coming back into the land but there's a promise in his life he's got the birthright amen he's got the blessing the birthright from abraham is moving down through this individual he's walking with the birthright and he's a deceiver he's a human being like any other human being and he's and he's connived and cheated his way to get everything he has and now he's he's left his father-in-law under deception and snuck away amen and now he's coming into the land and he's fearful he's afraid of his brother because he cheated his brother this isn't a bold man this isn't a man with integrity this isn't somebody that you would look at with great respect and great honor a great person in the earth but he has the birthright amen and god knows what's down inside and what his positioning and who he really is amen not what he's done but who he is because what he's done does not always indicate who he is amen and so when he's coming scared and separating his flocks and his servants and his wives and his children and going by himself amen jacob was not going to knock on an angel's door he was not going to meet god he was not going to make god do something for him but god when he got into this condition god came on the scene and presented himself as a man to jacob and when jacob there was some significance and jacob knew it amen because jacob got a hold of this man and would not let go and jacob was not fighting for his life he was not trying to kill this man and this man kill him because as i he says i will not let you go till you bless me he knew this vessel contained the blessing this man had something for me and jacob's trying to get what this being can give him you understand and the very fact that he presented himself there shows you that this is god's will this is what god wants this is god's will god wanted to present himself in this form to jacob this day in this condition in this situation amen and when jacob got a hold of the angel amen the angel had the power to him but he says let me go and he says i'll not let you go till you bless me. and the blessing came in the changing of a name there was a change that was taking place there was a new identification that was coming and that new identification would bring also with it a blessing so when jacob began to wrestle with this being with this individual amen as he wrestled with this and was calling for a blessing what he was receiving was a change amen what is receiving was a change of identity a change of walk amen everything in his life was about to change amen but he knew enough when he was presented with this opportunity he didn't walk away he didn't he didn't bypass it he didn't just say god bless you good day and move on but when he came in contact with something that he sensed was real and something that he was since was able to help him amen he wrestled with it and wrestled with it and wrestled with it until the change came he wrestled with it till he got what he was seeking he wrestled with it tell he was blessed until everything changed in his life hosea said he had power over the angel and prevailed friends that's an amazing statement we're going to come back to genesis and look at it here so we're going to come back to chapter 32 but i want to look at exodus 32 for just a minute exodus 32 and verse 7. in exodus 32 verse starting verse 7 and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou brought us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped them and have sacrificed there unto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and then i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation now look at the instructions god is speaking to moses and god said this is what's happened this is what they've done this is the kind of people they are now leave me alone is this what he says this is the mouth of god this is the word of god this is a commandment from god to moses leave me alone let my anger wax hot then i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doeth i dot thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou has brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth to turn from their fierce wrath and repent of this evil and turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people who is moses talking to what kind of conversation is this amen god speaks to moses face to face he is face to face with god and god is saying this is what's going on this is the people i'm i'm done with it leave me alone that my anger may wax hot and i can consume them and i'll raise up a new nation out of you and moses said don't do it don't you think what your enemies will think do you think god didn't know what they would think do you think moses is telling god anything god did not know or god has not considered before do you think moses has more wisdom than god do you think moses has a better idea than god but moses now he says turn now he's commanding god turn from thy fierce wrath and repent who's talking to who repent of this evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel like god had forgot remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swearst by thine own self and says unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken them will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever now he's reminding god of the word of the promise he made abraham seed now he's remind first he says all your enemies will think that you couldn't get it done repent of this don't do it and don't you remember what you said and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people brother benham says in souls that are in prison he said there was a scripture that always puzzled me how that moses could tell god a better idea than god had till i found out that it was the spirit of christ in moses that wasn't just moses talking to god there was something else in moses and it was another part of god amen another attribute of god it was god talking to god no man can talk that way to god no no sin born sexual born creature can stand in god and say god you're wrong on this you're wrong on that repent of this don't you even remember the promise you made no one can talk like that and live friends but it wasn't just moses moses was playing the part he was called to amen god was giving an ear to moses not because of moses not because of his natural birth not because of his education his good looks his ideas he was lending ear to moses because moses was playing a part that god needed him to play and it was another part of god it was another attribute of god that was expressing standing in the gap throwing himself before the people later he'll say god amen forgive your people and if you must blot a name out blot my name out and not theirs and brother man points to that and say see that's christ throwing himself in the breach standing in the gap it wasn't the man that had the right to contend with god it was the god in the man and the god in the man did not say well if that's what you want to do your god you know everything and you must be right you understand there's a motivation that came over moses there's an inspiration that welled up of him because of his position because of who he was amen because of the part that he was playing there's an inspiration to come and in that inspiration he'll begin to contend with god he'll begin to to bring another idea to god and try to convince god that this is not a good idea and god needed him to play that part because god must be just but he also is a god of mercy but he needs somebody to stand in the gap and throw himself in the breach and stand up for the people that he's going to bring judgment so he was playing another part of god and he was playing it under inspiration and god was pleased with what moses was saying it's not that moses amen outsmarted outwitted outmaneuvered god and when he said god repented of the evil it wasn't as though god now god's he's all fired up and his wrath is hot and he's going to go down and slam and start over and moses starts rebuking him and he starts getting sheepish puts his hands in his pockets and won't look moses in the eye and when moses is done he kicks the ground says all right i won't kill him god didn't want to kill him that was never the plan the plan was have an intercessor amen the plan was have somebody stand in the gap but god's got to come in judgment before that attribute could rise on the occasion moses was anointed amen moses was inspired moses was playing another part of god god was playing one part moses was playing another part and god wanted him to play that part and when he said god repented brother branham said god has never had a new thought about anything so moses did not bring him a new thought he knew all things he knew the end from the beginning he knew the plan and the exodus journey amen but he had to have moses and moses had to have another part of god amen so that god's plan can come to fruition amen because god amen amen god is one amen but god has divided himself as attributes and they're all playing their part at different times like a great symphony of god so that god could bring his whole plan down and show his characteristics to his children and brother ben says i never understood how moses could have a better idea than god until i recognized it wasn't moses it was god so you can say i think it would be safe to say even though i don't have the scripture for this but i don't think it's contrary to scripture to say moses contended with god and prevailed i don't think that's opposite to what we saw moses contended with god and prevailed how not because of his wisdom not because of his strength but because of who he was now let's go back to genesis 32. genesis 32 verse 27. and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed this word power in this sentence means to contend to have power to kent to contend with to persist to exert oneself this is what he had with god the ability to exert himself the ability to contend with the ability to have power with and he says thou has power the ability to contend with or persist with or to exert oneself and with god in men and has prevailed this word prevail means to overcome to have power to be able to be able to gain or to accomplish to be able to endure to be able to reach to prevail over or against to overcome to be the victor this is the power that he has with god and man and has prevailed he has overcome he has become the victor and i want to look at this name he was given israel because the name is very interesting the name israel and it says uh in verse 27 again but jacob will not be thy name no more be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince thou has power with gone so we know that that name is uh israel means prince with god but in the hebrew when you get down to the to the hebrew there's the the strong's concordance and also many others that i looked at but strong's concordance says this israel means god prevails god prevails and in many concordances in many uh hebrew dictionaries it means the same thing god prevails it also means a prince with god and because the word prevails the same word for prince in israel l is god and so this word means god prevails so jacob's name in the prevailing over god the contending with the angel the holding on and not letting go the power he had with god the power he had over the angel was evidence that god prevailed it was not jacob prevailing it was god prevailing in jacob it changed his name amen because his name changed his nature changed everything changed it was no longer jacob prevailed over laban with his deceit he prevailed over his daddy with his deceit he prevailed over esau with his deceit jacob knew how to prevail this was not jacob prevailing amen that kind of prevailing would never prevail over this angel but there was a different prevailing because of the birthright because of who he was because of the time he was coming to because of the condition of the age that he was in amen there was another prevailing that was deeper than the mind that was deeper than the nature that he was born with but this was god prevailing in jacob [Music] it was god wrestling with god i hope you don't think i'm crazy but i hope you can see the scriptures it was a attribute of god manifesting part of god's plan called to take a position in god's great economy amen there had to be an anointing in his life there had to be an attribute expressing his life there had to be something that was moving him because of god's ordained plan amen he was moving into the promised land he had to get into position he had to be in the right place amen esau couldn't kill him amen none of these things could happen he he was ordained he was the expression of god's thought for that day he was the word being made manifest in that day it was jacob abraham isaac jacob they were the expressions of god in those vessels in their day and it was the expression of god's in god's great plan the word of god and the promise of god was now being expressed in jacob so there was a portion of god and jacob amen and that portion of god had a he had a special position with god not anybody amen can just go find god grab a hold of god hold on to the angel of the lord hold on to this image of a man until he prevails and overcomes and gets a blessing it doesn't work that way friends god showed up because he wanted him to grab a hold of him god came on the scene because he wanted jacob to wrestle with him praise be to god brother ben says convinced in concern jacob one night you know he had left laban and he was on his road over the desire come in his heart to visit his homeland and now we find out that he was afraid he was afraid to meet his brother so he got down to business before he crossed jordan and prayed all night and he wrestled with the lord wrestled all night and he said i'll not let you go i like that hold on to him right stay all night with him andrew did stay all night with him and he wrestled with the angel all night and the angel said it's coming daylight i must leave he said i'll just not let you go i want something in me that's different i want something in me that changed me how did he know that this angel could make that change what mental conception he had did the angel first give him his card and say see on here i but it was something in him amen met the reality and when something in him met the reality he was not going to let this go until that changed me amen there's something i need more there's something i need more than what i have i cannot overcome me but by whatever mechanism he knew he knew that what he got a hold of had the power to make a change in him said i want something in me that will change me and you notice as soon as the lord blessed him the blessing that he asked for he was ready then to cross the river and go see his brother why he wrestled all night he stayed with he stayed with god all night long and wrestled with god now you just said hey leave me alone now i'm tired the blessing would have never come that's what brother branham says the blessing would have never come i always when i read the bible so many times i read the bible you see circumstances work out and things happen and i always ask what would have happened if they hadn't said done and you never know i mean you could surmise all day long and you never really know but brother brennam tells us if he had not held on the blessing would have never come but i ask you the question did god want him to hold on or not i have to take my jacket off for this one when the angel said let me go did he really want him to let him go when there's a promise of god you want manifest in your life and it looks like god's shaking you off does god want you to shake off does god want you to back down does god want you to turn tail and say well it must not be for me it must be for somebody else i must not no when it's presented to you god wants you to hold on like jacob held on god presented himself to jacob so jacob would hold on amen and god didn't make it easy for him god afflicted him and crippled him before he blessed him this meeting with god this meeting with the man amen it was having a negative effect on him i ask you a question if you're wrestling with a man that has the power to touch your thought and you instantly are you going to keep a hold of him are you going to let him go and say he you could go now what is he holding on for more crippling more destruction he was holding on because he knew that this man can bless me if it cripples me he can bless me if if it afflicts me he can bless me if i wrestle all night he can bless me if i wrestle two nights he can bless me if i'm still holding on in the morning there's no place else i can get what i need this is the only source that i have and i have no option but to hold on until he blesses me if he afflicts me if he tells me to go away if he shakes me off if he tells me i'm no good it doesn't matter i have no other option this is how god deals with his elect [Music] jacob elect he's elect this is how god deals with his elect he shows up as a man he's an angel as a man but it's really god and jacob somehow gets entangled with this man the bible doesn't tell us all that and jacob knows somehow that this is the solution to my problem he knows it he probably doesn't know how he knows it how is it you know it that this word is the only way it wasn't your intellectualism it wasn't your good upbringing but there's something in you that knows this word or this hour is the only way there is no other way nothing else can deliver me nothing else can save me nothing else can change me i mean the same way you know that this word is it the only thing that can deliver you is the same way that jacob knew that this angel was that had the power to deliver me and there's no other way and while he's wrestling he comes under great pain and affliction but he does not let go because i still have no other place to go i'm telling you getting a hold of this word sometimes will you amen getting a hold of this word will cause affliction it'll cause pain it'll cause suffering and if you haven't experienced any of that i'm questioning what you got a hold of because whatever with this word this living word of bread of life the lord jesus christ the word of the hour when you get a hold of it amen it begins to change you amen it begins to affect you it begins to change the way you walk and afflictions come amen but that's not the time to turn loose of what you got to hold up amen because that's the only thing that can save you got a hold of it amen couldn't turn it loose even after being crippled couldn't turn it loose the angel's now saying let me go what if god looked at you and says leave me alone that's what jesus said to the woman who had a child grievously vexed with the demon he said leave me alone he called her a dog and said the children's better not for dogs amen she wasn't contesting that she didn't care if she was a dog or whatever he had to be called she just knew this is the man that can change the situation and nobody else can if he calls me a dog if he tells me to go away if the disciples make fun of me it doesn't change anything because that's the only source i have to go to she says she says oh son of david she called him by the wrong name she had no rights to him as son of david have mercy upon me and he just ignored her she cries out again and he says it's not right to give the children's bread unto dogs most of the people in this world if they come in contact with the living god and god says something like that to them they just put their head down and walk away god is not looking for those kind of people that is not what god's searching for god's searching for the one he can afflict and they won't let go he's searching for the ones he can shake and they won't turn loose he's searching for the ones he can call a dog and they won't leave he's searching for the ones that he can say leave me alone it's coming the break of the day and he's looking for the ones that will say i will not let you go because he's looking for the other part of himself he's not looking for people to make a church he's looking for the rest of himself he's looking for the counterpart the one that recognizes the one that holds on the one that endures to the end the one that knows this is the only hope that i have i have no other hope i will not turn loose i don't care if you slay me yet will i serve him what is that it wasn't you and your beauty it's not you and your wisdom it's not you and your willpower god will make sure by the end of your wrestling match you have no willpower left you don't have no intelligence left you have nothing left the only thing you have left is god on the inside that grabs a hold and says i cannot let go until you bless me that's what god's looking for he doesn't make it easy because it's not for the ones who are looking for it easy this ain't a laodicean message for laodicean people this is a bride message for his bride and his bride has his character inside of them and that's what he's looking for and he won't make it easy how many times have you said why does it have to be so hard i hope i'm not the only person who ever said that but i've said that a lot actually why does that have to be so hard it's one fire to the next fire it's one affliction to the next it's one trial to the next trial it's one heartbreak one difficult situation one upset from one to the next to the next to the next because that's the only way he can find the one with the birthright this message came to you amen not because you came to it jacob didn't come to the lord the lord came to him and this message came to you not for you to play with not for you to have tea with not for you to have a passing conversation god came your way one day to see what you would do about it i can imagine now i forgive me if i imagine wrong but this is chad's imagination it's not scripture but my imagination that the angel of the lord is wrestling with jacob and my question on my mind is is he enjoying it or does he hate it is it part of the plan or is it not part of the plan not that he's enjoying afflicting jacob i don't think the affliction brought him joy even though he was changing his walk i don't think the agony brought him joy i think what was bringing him joy was seeing a son act like a son i can just imagine him wrestling with him going that's my boy and trying not to smile that's just my imagination i may be wrong but god wanted jacob to overcome god did not end that battle to shut jacob down and have him walk away defeated god entered that wrestling match for jacob to overcome and when jacob began to overcome he had to recognize it wasn't jacob now you're israel now god is prevailing jacob is dying and god is prevailing jacob is changing the old man the old nature it's dying and now i'm going to give you another name because in this wrestling match jacob is dying amen but something else is coming to life inside of jacob and i'm going to give the name of that thing that's come alive and you the name of israel which means god prevails and it was god prevailing in his son brother brahms says in the message the seed is not air with the shuck so did you ever see an eagle compromise no sir there's no compromising in him neither does a genuine christian he ain't soft he'll hunt till he finds it amen yes sir he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna he'll get down there and dig till he finds it he'll fly higher and higher if there's none in this valley he'll rise a little higher the higher you go the more you can see it's time for eagles of this day to get to flying higher dig into god's promises not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago get out of it politics voting in voting out saying this that and the other the holy spirit has no more right of way in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word in case you're wondering this in 1965 no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulturized down get a denomination put their name on the book and got lazy and soft and sets back there gloating in some kind of dedicarian and then supposed to be at least a hawk that's a similar brother to the eagle the the prophet that brought the true word and manifested it relies on half rotten man-made theology where does he get it in some man-made sunday school program she some educator killed for him back in some seminary tell them that the days and miracles has passed there was no such thing as baptism of the holy ghost all this nonsense you mean to tell me that an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it no sir neither will a christian eat on the dead or carrying from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of god fresh and the promise of the hour god promised rabbits in the days of luther he promised other things in the days of others but he has promised us a full square meal the full seven course menu for all the seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of god to those who can receive so where brother abraham says in the same quote he says no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more wrestling with the angel no more getting ahold of what you sense has the power to change you no more uh no more laboring with god and saying god but your word says no more taking the role of moses say lord don't you remember your promise to abraham isaac and jacob no more saying god don't you remember your promise on the day of pentecost when peter said if i repent and baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and i'm not moving until you fill me with the holy ghost why because i'm reminding you of your word i'm doing what moses did i'm saying do you remember what you said through peter do you remember what's in the book of acts do you remember what was said on the inaugural day and lord i've repented i've been baptized in your name and now i'm receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and i'm here to receive it lord and i'm not turning loose till i get it no more laziness no more soft dotiness no more vulturizing down and letting everybody else do everything for you amen but now it's god in you amen christ in you the hope of glory god manifesting his counterpart in you one part's here giving the word the other part's here trying to come and saying uh give me the book and the other part's saying take it that's written that way for a reason a voice saying go to the angel and take the little book and eat it up amen go to the angel the angel wrestling with the angel the angel with the open book and you say give me the book and the angel says take it i wonder if he's looking for another wrestling match i wonder if he's looking for somebody else that will reach out and try to get it or does he have to cut it up in really little pieces and marinate and soften it and put in the pressure cooker and get all the bones out of it and does you have to take the open book the word and say now um my mom open your mouth choo-choo here comes the train do you understand what i'm saying he's looking for the counterparts he's looking for somebody to say give me that book i've got to have that book that open book revelation the revelation that's entire contained in the entire book i got to have it give it to me god give it to me now [Music] i don't think that's not i don't think that's contrary to his desire i don't think it's contrary to what he's looking for i think it's the very thing that happened in jacob when jacob was coming into his birth right he said i will not let you go until you bless me and now there's an open book and a mighty angel that's come with a revelation open in his hand amen and you've been instructed to go to that angel and take the book but when you go to the angel to take the book to get the book he says take the book and i'm just curious i'm just the way i'm wired i'm curious is he looking for somebody else who will persevere is he looking for somebody who will reach out and take it or is he looking for somebody that'll say i'm here lord if you want to give it to me you can if you don't that's okay too what do you mean that's okay too it's okay with you that you don't get the revelation of the hour it's okay with you that the open book doesn't become your meat i'll tell you it's not okay with me there's something inside of me i'm not okay with that i'm not satisfied with no revelation of the word i'm not satisfied with no eating of the book because i know that's my inheritance that's the title deed the redemption that's the solution to all of my problems lays in that open book and i'm not going to be satisfied till i take it until i eat it too many people want to come to church and hear a good sermon that's not what any of this is about come church have a nice place to take your family hear a good encouraging sermon some instructions on how you know being nice to your neighbor and being a good dad and being a good mom and we'll feel good about being with the bride we're the bride with the bride and we'll go home and we'll do it again on wednesday and we'll do it again on sunday and my kids will get older and they'll get married in the church and we'll have a good time and the grandkids will be gathered around and we'll always have fun together always be nice that is not why the message came that just starts a new system a new denomination a new lazy vulturizing down and just getting into a form of religion and a system now called the message but god is looking for his israels amen god is looking for his princes amen because it's the princes that have power with god he's looking for kings and priests amen he's looking for a different breeding he's looking for somebody amen that has a different genetics on the inside we're not here to be generational believers in my father's footsteps that's what the israelites did and they failed we're not here to you know have a family heritage of the message we would all love that but what we want is every individual to go to the mighty angel and take the book amen they say give it to me because they take it say i'm taking it amen i'm eating it and i'm eating it all if you've got to do that by yourself do it by yourself if not another member of your family will do it you do it all by yourself because god is watching what you do with his word when he passes by when the angel of the lord comes by what do you do do you say it was nice to meet you it was a pleasure oh my i feel so privileged to be in your presence or do you reach around grab his mantel roll it around in your hand and hold on and say i gotta have something from you i can't keep going this way i gotta have that open book i gotta have that revelation i gotta have a change that completely changes me [Music] if you slay me i'm not turning loose if you afflict me i'm not turning loose if you call me a dog i'm not turning loose if you tell me to let go i'm still not letting go he told moses to stand aside and moses got right in his way so what the bible said amen he told moses to stand aside and moses did not hearken to the voice of the lord am i writing the bible on my own moses no no no no no listen listen listen listen all right god listen remember when you brought them out of egypt and what they're going to say and they'll just say you couldn't take them in and and god and and and and repent of this lord don't do this and remember what you told abraham isaac and jacob oh i'm sure god was if god had buttons to bust they were busting because that's what he was looking for that's what he wanted we wanted too many things easy but brother branham said christians are rugged they're not hot bed plants they don't need to be babied and petted they're rugged what he said you can't shake a believer off the word he's like a pit bull once he gets a hold of a tire you're not getting the let loose there's a believer who says this is god and i gotta have god let's turn to genesis 18. we went through this but i just want to go through it again if that's all right it's too late to say no this is 18 23. god's come down on the plains of memory and told abraham that they're now going to judge sodom verse 23 and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked per adventure there would be 50 righteous within the city will thou also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein and he says listen verse 25 that be far from thee to do after this manner he's now calling god's character into question he said god you're going down islam but what if there's 50 down there that's righteous you wouldn't destroy the 50 you wouldn't destroy the the righteous with the unrighteous you wouldn't destroy it because of the 50. he says that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right who's he talking to who does he think he is it might just be christ in another form who does abraham think he is we know he's the elect seed of god we know he is the mystery of christ that's being unfolded in the old testament being unfolded through him we know that and now god comes down and he's letting abraham know hey i can't hide anything from you why couldn't he hide it from him because he's part of him i can't hide it from you and i begins to tell him about sodom well abraham has somebody he loves down in sodom and abraham he begins listen abraham begins to contend and barter with god and in his contending and bartering with god he's actually evoking the character of god to rise up he's saying god if far be it from you to do a thing like that i mean that wouldn't be like you to treat the righteous with the wicked wouldn't the judge of all the earth do right speaking to god like he's a child and god says no i won't destroy it for 50. see god wasn't upset at abraham god didn't get angry with abraham god was watching for abraham to respond abraham was playing the part god wanted him to play he goes on to 40 to 30 to you know all the numbers i'll pick it up in verse 32 and he said oh let not the lord be angry he had done this with god i think four times already or something like that he kept saying and god would say he would relent to abraham abraham for fifty you what he said okay for 50. he says well what about for you know 45 or 40 whatever the number is and and god relents no i won't then he asks again and he asks what is he doing he's bartering with god he's negotiating with god he gets down verse 3 he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once per adventure 10 shall be found there said i will not destroy it for ten sake and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communion with abraham and abraham returned into his place now we know god did not find 10 because he destroyed sodom and he said he wouldn't so there was not 10 righteous in sodom but chapter 19 verse 29 says and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt god did not remember lot but he remembered abraham abraham who interceded with god abraham who threw himself in front of god abraham who was bartering what was abraham bartering for a wicked city amen an evil city amen who was very wicked and it was well known that they were wicked amen but he was bartering for a reason there was a motive in his heart there was something he was trying to do he was standing in the place of intercession and god could not relinquish because abraham said i'll say this and i'll say nothing else 10. and god said i won't do it for 10. and abraham held his word he didn't say anything else and you have to imagine now i say this but i could be wrong but you'd have to imagine abraham all night toss and turn hoped god would find 10. brother branham said when you read the bible you have to read between the lines because the bible condenses its truths i mean this is this is the whole character of god but will condense it down into one line two lines a paragraph so no doubt abraham tossed and turned all night and and had a had a a night where he wondered what would happen because he told god he wouldn't say anything else ten zen he said ten god said ten and abraham i'm sure was hopeful that that would be enough he's probably thinking you have lot of his wife he's got two daughters he's got some other daughters and son-in-laws that might get it 10. when abraham got up that morning he went and he looked he saw it was all smoke i wonder how he felt i wonder if he felt like i shouldn't have said i won't say no more i wonder how he felt i wonder what thoughts were going through his mind as he looked at the smoldering ruins of sodom and the smoke going up like a furnace you think he didn't think about lot lot's wife and his nieces but god remembered abraham he remembered the role abraham was playing he remembered the desire of abraham's heart he remembered abraham bartering with him he remembered abraham contending with him and he remembered abraham and he saved lot which was the object that he was after to begin with god knew his heart god wasn't angry with abraham he wasn't going to punish abraham he wasn't upset with abraham but god honored abraham remembered abraham and saved lot not because of lot but because of abraham you have to ask yourselves what kind of people are these what kind of person is jacob what kind of person is abraham what kind of person is moses what kind of people are they and i want to say they're people just like me they are children of almighty god they are the heritage of the lord they are attributes expressed in their day of almighty god expressing to me how i ought to live in this day see to moses it wasn't trivial it wasn't light it was life and death to abraham it wasn't trivial it wasn't light it was life and death i want to turn to the book of acts if you could turn with me there i hope you don't think the bible's dead and i hope you don't think these are just for the old testament i hope you can begin to see who you really are if there's a people on the earth that have power with god who would they be if there are people on this earth who can prevail over the angel take the book and eat it who would they be ask yourself am i one of them is that who i am is that who god wants me to be or am i just a church member do i just want just to have a house and a job and a car and raise my family and go to church and just that's all i want i hope that's not all you want i hope you're tired of going to church and being challenged challenged on your walk challenged on your revelation challenged by the truth i'm tired of going to church and being challenged challenged challenged well i hope that's not who you are i hope the challenge of the word is calling you higher i hope the challenge in the word and the revelation is saying listen it's me come up higher amen don't stay where you're at rise amen stretch your wings and fly you've got to move on we've got to go farther we've got to rise above where we are we can't stay like this forever we got to keep moving with god i hope we recognize who we are it was never easy for any believer ever in the day in the age they lived it was never simple it was always complicated it was never without strife it always had strife it was never without rejection it was never without wrestlings it was never without all of these things every age everyone they had their own trials god didn't make it simple because the gifts or the rewards are to the overcomers god made it simple then there's nothing for you to receive because he gives all the rewards amen to the overcomers and the inheritance goes to the overcomers and god makes promises to the overcomers so god in his faithfulness and his generosity make sure that you have plenty to overcome so you can get plenty of rewards acts chapter 27. acts chapter 27 the apostle paul is being sent to rome he's been arrested but he's committed no crime he has no official charge because the centurion just picked him up because he was being beaten by the jews and he had to rescue him the only place to rescue him was to hide him in prison so he kept him hiding in prison for a couple years but paul had never done anything wrong there was no criminal trial there was nothing no charges against him every official that tried him said he is worthy of neither death nor bonds every one but god had already told him fear not for as thou has testified in jerusalem so shall thou testify of me in rome so paul knows he's going to rome the the lord told him he was going to rome when he was arrested he knows his destiny is in rome is that right not because he committed a crime or did anything wrong because he has to testify in rome in the journey they're sailing and they're sailing at wintertime and paul tries to encourage them not to leave this harbor this port because he tells him don't go let's wait this winter and the captain of the ship tells the centurion who's in charge of the soldiers no we must go and the captain believes is the master of the ship and they go on and then they get caught in a terrible storm a typhoon and this typhoon is raging for multiple days it's raging by the time it's over and by the time they shipwreck it'll be 14 days and paul's on the ship and the the the soldiers are on the ship there's 200 and some souls on the ship over 250 souls on the ship and paul had been journeying with him for a while and the centurion had been really good to him because when they stopped at different ports he would give him liberty to go be refreshed with his friends it appears that luke was traveling with him because luke is the one who's writing this and luke says we we dispatch we lose from this so it looks like at least he has one companion maybe more traveling with him they have the merchants or the the the sailors on the merchant ship the master of the ship the centurion the soldiers the prisoners and in this time paul is on has had ample opportunity to know some of them at least like i said the centurion was good to him who knows who else he had contact with and communication spoke with and the weeks that they were journeying but they come to the storm and the storm is such a storm that even the sailors knew that all was lost like there was no hope there's no chance that the seamen who had been through storms before knew that we're finished let's look in verse 20 and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no snow small tempest lay on us all hope that we should have been we should be saved was then taken away there's no hope now but after a long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and lost and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar now stop don't read on please don't read on you ruined the whole thing for me what's paul doing in a long abstinence sleeping my personal opinion is he was praying because luke was the one writing this and said we saw that there was no more hope all all hope was lost but paul appeared after long abstinence he hadn't been around on the deck he hadn't been visible to the soldiers and sailors and centurion and even luke his companion he was off by himself separated and my opinion is he was praying because during the abstinence while he was gone the angel of the lord and says fear not thou must be brought before caesar so it makes you wonder was he asking about the prophecy was he maybe reminding god god you told me i will testify in rome because you got to think these it wasn't just like a little wave and some rain and a little bit of splashing over the boat they had already thrown out every bit of merchandise on the ship they had thrown out all the extra tackle they had gotten rid of everything the light and the load so that they wouldn't sing they had nothing they absolutely had nothing no hope nothing but paul had the word of the lord that told him he's going to go to rome so now paul is in a long abstinence separated not visible amen any and and while he's in this absence which i believe was prayer and intercession the lord said to him where am i okay he said yeah the angel that's verse 23 again for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and who whom i serve saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee what was paul worried about what was paul asking for what was the purpose of paul's long abstinence i can't say for certain but all i can say was the angel's response the angel's response to paul was don't fear paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo i have given you every soul that is in the ship every soul whether they're believer or not believer amen whether they whether they were a soldier or a merchant or a companion every soul was given to paul not by their merit but because of paul they were given to paul they weren't given to god they weren't given to christ they were given to paul i want to say what kind of man is this amen what kind of man is this that in the midst of a hopeless situation god will come to this man and then the angel whose i am and whom i serve what kind of angel was that that was the angel of the lord that was god himself [Music] come to paul and said don't fear paul you must be brought before caesar and i give you every soul that is in the ship with you friends what kind of person has power with god what kind of power is this what what kind of what kind of people are we dealing with when we talk about paul when we talk about abraham when we talk about moses when we talk about jacob i believe we're talking about a god race a god race a supersede that's who i believe we're talking about that paul's very presence on that ship and listen they didn't listen to him he told them not to leave they didn't listen to him they got themselves in the fix because they didn't listen to him but in getting themselves into the fix they got paul in a fix and paul in the long abstinence is doing something and in this long absence the angel lord says fear not you're going to appear before caesar and i have given you every soul that's in this ship look what paul does next verse 24 he's saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me paul never told them you have to believe paul says be of good cheer i believe god amen and i believe it'll be done so what he told me if you don't believe that's up to you but i believe and because i believe you're going to be saved because i believe god because i'm here because i have a destiny in caesar's court because in my abstinence i i met an angel and the angel told me that i am going to go to caesar and that all the souls on the ship were given to me to me they were given to paul do you understand that i give to thee every soul meaning nobody's going to die paul comes out and says cheer up the sun is up the trial's over hey listen waves were crashing over the ship the sails were torn the tackle was gone he says be of good cheer amen be of good cheer it's all over i've heard from the lord you're all going to be saved and they must have believed him because they all started eating he says he says here verse 25 therefore serves be of good cheer i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me how be it we must be cast upon a certain island but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipment deemed that they drew near some country i'm not going to read all that you read it all later but paul tells them to take meat and eat and they start eating because they had not been eating for some period of time because they were so worried and so troubled amen and paul was so convinced and believed god amen he convinced him to eat and they eat when it come time to go ashore he told them to eat because you're going to need strength they listened to him but all those souls were given to paul what kind of man is this brother bam says in blind bartimaeus we got faith to believe that god can do it and we'll do it let's take a hold of it and hold on just don't let it go stay right with it if it don't come now it'll come ten minutes later hour later two weeks later month later no matter when it comes i gotta hold and i'm going to stay with it let's turn to the book of daniel we're also very familiar with this but i just i just wish to read it daniel chapter 10. daniel chapter 10 verse 11. an angel would come and touched daniel he says in eleven and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved daniel is in a special position with god daniel is greatly beloved he said to me doe daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia which stood in me one in twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes come to help me and i remain there with the kings of persia now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thee thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days we've talked about this before but when we preached several weeks ago i'm moving the heavenlies from earth but daniel daniel is a man but when this man set his heart to pray and inflicted himself and began to fast and pray for the revelation to come the very day he set his heart to seek god god sent an angel this angel now the moving of this angel was going to trigger a sequence of events that was going to bring the collapse of babylon and the collapse of the medes and the persians i'm sorry and bring in through alexander great bring in the greek empire but it was dependent on a man on earth not just any man one that was greatly beloved a special man of a special race of a special seed line and when that man began to pray amen heaven went into action and began to move and warfare broke out and we've talked about all of that but but now because daniel's still praying and because daniel set the heavens in motion he stays in prayer for 21 days daniel doesn't pray for a day get no answer and stop daniel wants to know there's something motivating him to have the answer and he's sticking with it until the answer comes and while he's sticking with it it's not as if nothing's happening in his perspective nothing's happening but if we had heavenly vision you would see that there was a lot happening and what was happening what daniel's fasting daniel sprang was triggering events this event this event now we'll get michael michaels involved and now i'll go back and i'll fight again i'll stand against the king of persia and after that the the prince of greece shall come nations were going to be toppled amen changing towers and kingdoms are going to take place because daniel was motivated to know something out of the word daniel saw the time of a promise and daniel begin to pray and fast and afflict himself to know the answer to the question is this the time sirs and as he began to pray an angel was dispatched warfare broke out things began to happen and after the message came through he brings a revelation to him and he goes back for a time of changing of powers i say what kind of man is this he's the same kind as the rest we've talked about brother branham says in the message accepting god's provided way at the end time he said cry for your needs that's god's provided way didn't jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that cried day and night cry for it let's look at that in luke chapter 18. turn with me to luke chapter 18. in luke 18 verse 1 he said he said a spake a parable unto them to this end that men not always to pray and not to faint so jesus teaches a parable for one purpose for this purpose and the purpose of the parable is that men will learn to pray and not faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god and neither regarded man there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me in my adversary and and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth jesus told them this parable to this end so that men will know how to pray without fainting he's telling you by the parable don't give up he might be telling you by the parable if i could say it this way that the widow prevailed over the judge i would say it this way the widow had power with the judge and the widow woman prevailed over the judge and jesus is using this as an example to teach us how to pray and not faint don't give up amen we're not here to pester god god's not going to get pestered and get upset with us but he's looking for somebody that will stick with it amen that'll stay with it that'll persevere he's looking for the other part of that attribute the other man goes and says cry for your needs that's god's provided way didn't jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that crieth day and night how much more will the heavenly father give them the spirit who cry for it day and night seek keep seeking knock keep knocking just keep on till the open stay out with it cry until the promised word is vindicated then you got it you don't have to worry no more you see the bible promised it then stay right there and cry until you get it if you see the bible promised it stay right there and cry till you get it you mean you mean i shouldn't quit crying i think that's what he said do you mean that maybe i could even do what moses did and said god remember in your word when it says by your stripes i'm healed could you maybe remind god of the word amen and maybe that's what he's looking for maybe he's looking for that other part of the attribute but he said god you've got to fulfill your word god what about your enemies that say this word isn't true god what about all of those that say that many days and miracles are passed what about all of those that said he used to heal doesn't heal anymore god what will all your enemies think when they hear i've already testified at work i've already told others that i'm believing your word god what about your character and god do you remember what you said is there still a people on the earth that has power with god he said cry until you get it now listen how brother brahm describes this if a little baby sees a cookie and he wants it he'd just cry and cry and cry and stick and kick and scream and holler and turn red in the face his mommy will get him a cookie and it's all over see he got what he saw what he wanted if he wants to lick off your ice cream cone he'll just keep raising a fuss till he gets it well that's the way we're supposed to do is that what he said that's the way we're supposed to do if i see a promise in the bible that's god's word then i just stay there and cry out until god gives it to me and he'd do that get you off his hand he'll do that to get you off his hands you see that would be in in the natural but he's wanting you to do it he likes for you to ask ask abundantly that your joys might be full cry until his word is vindicated now friend let's watch just a minute and i'll cry until the word is vindicated let's turn to james chapter 5. james chapter 5 and verse 16. james 5 and 16 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much is that true i think we're supposed to have fervent effectual prayer verse 17 elias was a man subject to like passions he's going to use this as an example of how you have to pray fervently elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit what is he showing as an example to us he didn't say well god you know god told elias to go say it's not going to rain and it was just easy he just said didn't rain didn't rain it was time to rain he said let it rain that's not how the bible depicts it that's not how the bible shows it it said he prayed earnestly that it wouldn't reign he contended for he prayed for it he sought god for it and it rained not and then it was time to reign again after the mount carmel showdown he put his face between his knees and he began to pray and he sent a servant he said go see if there's rain there was no rain he came again he prayed more what was he doing he was praying earnestly friends he wasn't saying well if god said he wants it it's going to happen if he doesn't want it it ain't going to happen no he sat there with his face between his knees and earnestly sought god for reign to keep the promise to keep the word to keep what was spoken and he did this seven times and on the seventh time his servant says i see a cloud coming out of the sea like a man's hand and he said run until ahab this is it i hear an abundance of rain even for elias in the prophecy it wasn't trivial it wasn't light it wasn't easy he had to pray earnestly that it would rain brother brahman says in questions and answers on the seals like you look in the bible it says knock and it'll be open seeking ask to be given now if you'll notice it's knocketh just constantly knock not one knock but knock it the continual knocking stay right there like the unjust judge wouldn't answer the woman he just kept knocking on her door saying i'm on your hand not seek say lord i love i'd like to have this amen that's not it stay right there till you get it you know it's going to come so he promised it so just stay right there till you hold on to it he says in god's provided way for this day in 1964 there is no better way they never found a better way for a baby to get what it wants than to cry for it would you give him a bounce hey junior you're only three days old but now when you want to when you want your bottle raise up this little bell and ring it if it works it don't work the baby cries for what it wants that's god's provided way the louder you cry don't whip the little fella he's only following god's provided way he's not talking about when he's 10 right talking about an infant he's coming god's provided way he wants something that's right it's the only way he knows to call his mother scream for it cry for it that's right god recommends this for his children god recommend recommends this for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some great theology theology to teach he wants you to cry for your needs and that's right cry out for it you're too stiff and starchy you'll never get it if you're ready to limber yourself up a little and cry god will give it to you he likes to hear his children cry cry your needs to god god wants it that's his provided way cry out for it that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied and that's the way the believing christians should do god's child if you see that god made the promise don't give it up cry till it's answered cry though you see god vindicates his word then god vindicates his word and proves it it's here then you don't have to cry no more you got it walk away and thank him for it until you do that scream out till you get it i like that persistent holding on not a hybrid plan not one that has to be babied petted packed around christians are real genuine born articles of god they fight for their position they fight for their finishes they fight till they're finished on this earth every move of it is a fight god didn't call us to a picnic he's called us to a battle god tells us a story through the prophet we've heard about moses we've talked about daniel we talked about elijah or yeah elijah talked about abraham talked about daniel we talked about paul but brother branham tells us a story about another great one that has power with god god tells us the story of another great christian that prevailed that overcame and prevailed and this was a little black woman a poor woman down in the south brother bam says and this old colored woman when i passed by she said good morning parson so i'm minister in the south as a parson i turned and i looked at her i said good morning auntie and the tears was running down them big black fat cheeks and she was kindly smiling i said how did you know i was a parson we all know the story but just to refresh it to you brother branham i think he was in tennessee somewhere and he was flying to another place and he was going to catch his plane and his plane was delayed while his plane was delayed it was grounded actually it was a storm they grounded the plane there i'm sorry they were going to fly out i believe it was the next day and he got a hotel and he had a suitcase and he was going to go back to the airport to catch his flight and move on with his journey but god told him to keep walking keep walking he goes well where am i going to go i've got my flight and the voice said keep walking and he kept walking and he said he didn't know where he was going just walking down the road keep walking and he's looking at some fishing tackle he talks to somebody and he doesn't know where he's going he doesn't know why he's going he goes then i got nervous my plane was going to leave but it told me to keep walking and then finally it was too late the plane's gone no point to be nervous anymore and he's walking along and as he's walking along and he walks by this woman and she says good morning parson and brother baby doesn't know why he's walking he doesn't know why the storm came up that the plane couldn't fly through he doesn't know why the plane was landed why he spent the night in the hotel why when he went to go get back on the plane the god told him to start walking he had no idea what he was doing he's just walking with no knowledge just listening to the voice and here says somebody says good morning parson he said how did you know i was a person i'm in a journey i don't understand i'm on a stroll that i don't know anything about i have no revelation of what i'm doing but how do you know that i'm a person she said did you ever read in the bible about the shunamite woman he said yes ma'am i have she says eyes that kind of a woman i had no children says i was a wash woman and she said i promised the lord if he would give me a child i would raise it for his glory and she said i've been a christian since i was a little baby girl she looked to be in her late 50s late 50s or 60s and she said the lord give me a fine boy she said and parson he got out in the wrong company and he took a bad disease and his blood was four plus the doctor men said and there was nothing could be done for him and said he's in the room dying said the doctor man left day before yesterday he was unconscious and said he could never gain consciousness again she said parson i just couldn't stand to see my baby die in that condition i said i prayed to the lord all night before last all last night what happened last night storm came up that an airplane couldn't fly through forced it to land in an airport forced a little man that was in that plane to go stay in a hotel all night and not continue on his journey said i prayed all night last night along about two o'clock this morning said i fell asleep and i dreamed that i was talking to the lord she said lord you gave me the baby like you did the shunammite woman but where is that elisha and he said the lord told me look and i seen a man coming where a tan suit and a little tan hat said it was you parson and i've been standing here at this gate before daylight waiting for you to come god works on both ends of the line [Music] we know the rest of the story brother bam goes into the house he said a poor little house hardly nothing in there at all poor little washer woman and her boy a great big strong boy laying there totally out of his mind totally ate up with a disease with a social disease and brother ben starts to talk to her about divine healing and she doesn't even interested in divine healing she wants her boy saved she's praying for his soul she won't even praying for his healing she's praying for his soul and brother branham because he walked in that home he said now i've been in king george's palace i've been to the king of sweden or switzerland he said i never felt more welcoming at home than i did in that little home i want to tell you why because one of those rare breeds was in that house one of those rares see the super seed was there amen amen the seed of god was abiding in that house one of those rare individuals that had power with god one of those rare individuals that could wrestle and overcome was living in that house and she wrestled all night till she brought up a storm god brought up a storm because she wouldn't let this boy die in that condition she was interceding for his soul i ask you what kind of woman is this what kind of power does she have what kind of human being is this that can begin praying for her baby all night and god will bring storms up god will reroute flights god will ground planes god will cause a man to keep walking to mrs plane miss his plans miss whatever he's got in his mind to direct that man right to her door what kind of woman is remember friends this had nothing to do with the prophet it wasn't his vision it wasn't his prayer it was hers she directed all of this because she was asking god i'm just like this woman in the bible this is who i am i'm one of your bible characters where's the other bible character where's my elijah so god had to send her an elixir we know the intercession of the woman worked because brother branham prayed for the boy he left he said some time later he was traveling back through tennessee and there was a boy working there at a hamburger stand he said great big tall strong fella says do you remember me he says no he says you remember one night when you prayed for a boy laying on the bed that's me he said and i'm a christian now i'm serving jesus what kind of person are we dealing with i'm said she was the same stock that moses was she's from the same stock as jacob she's of the same stock as the apostle paul and i'm of the same stock friends and that woman didn't pray a passing prayer she didn't pay a trivial prayer over a morning breakfast they meant she got down all night and prayed and she wrestled with god until she prevailed god is looking for the counterpart god is looking for somebody that believes him so much they won't stop he's looking for somebody that's got so much faith in his character that says lord you can't not fulfill your word they got so much confidence in his nature and his character and in his promises that they'll even remind god god this can't fail because you said do you remember your word you told me that i could have this lord it's not like you to withhold it oh praise god friends what kind of person are you what kind of person was moses what kind of person was jacob what kind of person was this washer woman and i want to ask you what kind of person are you amen is there something inside of you says this word is true and it has to work amen the promise for my healing has to work the promise for my children has to work the promise that i've been given has to work i'm the same kind of stock of the same seed i've got the birthright the same thing that was in them is in me and i've got the same desire and i'm not taking it trivial and i'm not taking it lightly but i'm going to wrestle with this till it comes to pass i'm going to hold on to that promise with both hands until it comes to pass in my life i'm not going to make excuses i'm not going to explain it away but i'm going to stay with it and wrestle and wrestle and wrestle and wrestle until i prevail and when i wrestle and wrestle and wrestle until i prevail do you know what i'll say god won the victory because it wasn't me it was god that prevailed in me it wasn't that washer woman it was god in that washerwoman she didn't have the power to ground that plane she didn't have the power to see a vision of a dream of a prophet coming it was god working through her vessel to save that boy he could no longer pray for himself but he had one that could intercede for him and she happened to be of the right seed see it's not you and i we're called the labor to cry out to pray but you'll never do it as a human being born of your earthly mom and dad amen you can cry and cry and cry and nothing's going to happen it's not about noise it's not about emotions but there's something in you that's more than you there's something deep inside that says god can't fail this word it has got to happen amen it's got to happen for the sake of god it's got to happen for the sake of god's children it's got to happen for the word's sake and i can't let down on it i can't back down on it i can't give it up i believe it's going to work and i'm not going to give up till it works and when it works and god fulfills his word maybe you're israel maybe it was god that was really prevailing maybe it was god the seed gene of faith down inside of you crying out to god the father of the sea gene saying bring it to pass and the two omnipotents were coming together to fulfill his word we always look at it as so easy and i mean like a fairy floating through and i'll have this and i'll have that and let this be and the prophet of god's ministry how many nights did he spend in prayer how many days did he spend in his cave how many hours seeking the lord how many fastings before prayer meetings god was working on both ends god is faithful to keep his word how faithful are we to hold him to his word and believe his word and hold on to it until it comes to pass he's faithful are we faithful he's determined to see it through are you determined to see it through he's determined to keep his word are you determined to see it through what kind of seed are we i say god i believe by faith whatever that washer woman is i am whatever moses was i am amen whatever jacob was i whatever it was moving through them that's the same thing moving in my heart it's more than intellect it's more than emotion there's a driving force inside of me that says this word is it and it has to come to pass god's nature won't fail god won't let it down this is the only way and i'm not going to turn it loose until i see the fulfillment of every promise in this end time everything that's been restored everything that the title deed book has been given because that title deed book is back in the hands of man again it was cast down and thrown down to the seventh church aged messenger who turned around and gave it to the church what does that mean the title deed book is back friends we've got it back in everything that adam lost has been restored back to us and i won't stop crying till we get it all amen i won't stop crying to the very nature of god as manifest as the one who keeps his promises we're going to hold on to it we're going to pray for we're going to cry out for god to fulfill it we're going to remind him we're going to remind him of sunset mountain we're going to remind him of march 1963 the preaching of sales we're going to remind him god you did this you promised this this is the season this is the hour this is the end time and if it's the end time which you declared through a prophet then it's the time for all end time prophecies and i'm holding on to them all maybe god is looking for a little bride who has power with god and who will prevail not change god's mind not correct god but play the other part of redemption the part that god plays and the part that you and i play let's be faithful let's recognize who we are listen if you don't know who you are do you know how to pray can you hold on if you don't know who you are can you grab a hold and never let go if you're still in doubt of who you really are well it's time to wrestle aloud till you know who you are and when you know who you are you know what your rights are in the book and when you know what your rights are in the book now you know what to hold on to and how to hold on you hold on till it comes to pass it's not easy it's not simple it's not for everybody a lot of people get brushed off when they get afflicted they let go when their leg is smitten they stop when jesus calls them a dog they stop when they find rejection with family they stop when they have a a pastor get go to the world and reject the truth they stop they stop they stop they stop but not everybody will stop there's a seed on the earth they'll say though he slayed me yet will i serve him though he afflict me i'll not let go though he called me a dog i still have no place else to go to get this promise fulfilled everybody else tells me you're nothing it doesn't matter to me what they label me all that matters is i'm standing here right in this present call me a dog send me away tell me it's not for me i'm telling you god i got no other place to go there's nowhere else to go there's no other truth out there there's nothing else that will deliver this is the only thing i got and i don't care what you tell me or what doubts pass through my mind and how the devil tries to get me to believe you're not this and you're not that i'm telling you i've got no place else to go and i'm staying right here until everything is fulfilled in my life i'm staying right here maybe that's the reason for the challenges friends maybe that's the reason for the difficulties maybe that's the reason you're limping today because you wrestled with the lord maybe that's the reason that he tells you to shoo you away he doesn't answer your prayer instantly and he doesn't make everything work out really quick maybe he's looking for his counterparts the part of him that can endure and see the word all the way through to the end if god will see the word all the way through the end he's going to have a people that can see the word through all the way to the end if you're believing for your loved ones believe all the way to the end god has given you faith a witness in your heart that they're yours hold on to it all the way to the end if you've got if you believe the promise of healing in the bible is yours hold on to it all the way to the end don't turn it loose don't be afraid to remind god hey god i'm still here and i'm still believing i'm still here my morning checkup i'm still here and i'm still believing that you're god that does not lie and your word says and i'm just reminding you of what i'm believing maybe that's what he's looking for rugged christians rugged believers of the same stock that they've all been in everyone in this bible was a rugged believer every one of them had opportunities to be brushed away and turned aside and rejected and criticized and scorned and every one of them pushed through all of that to stay true to the calling for their day to stay true to the word for their day did we think it was going to be any different maybe it's designed that way so god can identify his elect maybe it's designed that way so he can shake off all the non-elect but there's a couple little bulldogs that he can't shake off no matter how hard he shakes no matter how many disappointments strike the church there's a couple that just have dug in and they just won't let go shake a little harder and inside i can imagine you're going that a boy get off hold on get off hold on do you understand what i'm saying the question is what stock are you of and i believe i'm in that stock not because of my merit or my strength i've failed a thousand times ten thousand times i've let down been lazy tried to take the easy route i've done all of that but through it all there's still something in me says i gotta have it i gotta have it i gotta have it i gotta have it no matter how many times i let down the bar and i slip and i get lazy and i get laxed and i forget to pray and no matter how many times i do that there's still something that raises up and says but it's true and it will come to pass and i believe it that's not me that's god who's prevailing through me amen the one that brings me back to repentance it's not me it's god working through me the one that keeps holding on to the promise keeps believing the word keeps rehearsing the things that are true that's not me friends the be me would have let go but the god me is holding on and it's god prevailing with god it's god having power with god it's god on both ends say let us yield to that god part let the mind go let all comforts of life and all laziness go and let's just give in to our calling and say lord i'm holding on for all the promises every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line and i'm not satisfied until i taste the fruit of the whole book let's all stand and pray sister rachel if you want to go around back whoever would like to go with you you're welcome musicians if you'd like to come for the bin let's just bow our heads and pray oh lord jesus we thank you god for what you tell us out of your word we thank you god for the picture that you paint for the truth that you revealed to us god you're encouraging us to stay with it you're encouraging us not to give up because moses didn't give up when he was interceding lord jacob didn't give up when he was wrestling paul didn't give up until the souls were saved i pray god that you'd help us not give up the the woman that grounded brother venom's plane she didn't give up till her baby was saved god help us not to give up till we see the fulfillment of your word help us never to find a place to set camp get comfortable get lazy but help us to constantly hold on to that promised word and wrestle and not let go till we see it all the way through to the end god we don't have the strength in ourselves any more than jacob had in his human flesh to stop an angel but god there was something else in jacob that was you and because there was something else that was you he could prevail over the angel the angel could not break free because the angel could not break free from you god there was something in the wisdom of moses that wasn't the wisdom of moses when he began to intercede and implore on behalf of your children god it wasn't his intellect it wasn't the power of his argument it was you lord you couldn't resist yourself god i pray in this day as we yield to the life on the inside of us to the reality that who we really are lord may it be you inside of us not us prevailing over you but you lord having power with yourself you moving yourself into action maybe you on both ends lord fill us lord with your spirit direct us by your holy ghost keep us holding on lord let it be your nature your strength your power expressing in these humble weak vessels maybe your faith lord you're overcoming that's overcoming through us help us to yield to it to surrender to it to let it have expression god what kind of people were they in the bible they were a super race what kind of people are you calling for today a super race let it be the manifestation of the super race in us god i pray that you would strengthen us equip us let us make our choice help us lord to make our decision and stick with it that we might be the overcomers in this day we love you for your word we ask god that you would bring every bit of it into manifestation for you promised it you're not a liar but you tell the truth and we're expecting we're believing we're watching until we see every bit of it made manifest and come to fullness god bless your people those that are praying for loved ones may they hold on and see the salvation of their loved ones those that are holding on for healing may they be more determined than ever to hold on may they be encouraged in the inward man to hold on until they see the manifestation of their healing those that need deliverance i pray that they keep crying out and holding on with faith for deliverance expecting deliverance to come and may you be glorified in it all lord may it all be you on both ends working your great plan and bringing your great word to manifestation in this end time we ask you bless us and be with us as we sing your praises in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends i just want to remind you of communion we'll meet back here at 4 30 for communion and feet washing and god bless you brother ben oh

god completes his word in her fulfilling every promise and living his life and fullness in her she now knows how to hold on and we believe god's going to do wonderful things for her as she surrenders herself completely to him sister rachel because you love the lord you believe that he died for you and saved you and he's called you and you want to confirm your commitment to him it's my pleasure to baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ lord jesus as i lay hands on my precious sister lord i pray god that you would hold on through her lord that the attribute that's inside this vessel would rise up and lay hold of the promise and she would see you lord move and mightily on behalf and change the circumstances around her change everything in her mind and all around her all habits and all things of the world and may she lord be that victorious child by your great victory in her life fill her with your spirit manifest yourself on her and bring every promise of your word in this last
