========================================

And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, "Seeest thou this woman. I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet, but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head." Do you know? I tried to get a picture and I just couldn't find one that was worthy of it. But do you know how dirty and nasty their feet got? They're in sandals, not walking on asphalt. you know, pretty little country asphalt thing. You know, I always crack up about this. Like, we're going to go on a nature walk and it's got asphalt or pavement. No, they were walking through the dust, the same trail that the donkeys and the horses and everything right there. Trapping and you know, you can't avoid it after a while. Just all mixes together. Stink. I mean, you can't imagine it. It's hot. It's humid. There's sweat. Well, maybe not humid cuz it's kind of the desert, but I'm sure there was. Anyways, the feet were really, really gross. Really, really dirty. How many of you sisters, you know, you you keep the hair up, right? You go to wash the gross dishes, you put it up, right? You keep it out of the nasty water. You keep it you keep it clean. It's your honor. It's your glory. Take good care of it as you should. And here is this woman willing to surrender everything cuz she was a prostitute. So, looking good was good for business. She was willing to surrender all of that and say, "I'm gonna guess, you know, it might damage my hair. It might you know, whatever it be. And she was willing to do all that at the feet of Jesus and wipe that stuff with her hair. And kiss his feet. Amen. How far will you go? You say, "Oh, brother, I'll wash, you know, I'll get a I'll get some paper towels and I'll wash the feet." And everyone, you know, we say, "Oh, wow. Praise the Lord. That brother's washing the feet of Jesus." Jesus is looking and saying, "I asked you to go all the way." You see how far you go and then you don't go all the way. You might as well have not gone at all. The point is total surrender. Total surrender. Saints of God ch I mean take it back to your studies. See where it doesn't fit where God is always asking us how far will we go? But instead of going at how far he asks us, we go how far we think we should go. And we lean to our own understandings. God is asking for a mature bride to be willing to do anything he asks him to do, asks us to do when he asks us to do it.
