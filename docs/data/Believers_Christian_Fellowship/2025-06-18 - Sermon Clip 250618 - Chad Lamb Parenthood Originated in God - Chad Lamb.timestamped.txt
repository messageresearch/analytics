[0:00] I told the youth, we were we had a youth
[0:02] meeting and I told some of these the the
[0:04] youth, you if God continues on and
[0:07] allows time to continue and we have a
[0:09] couple more decades on this earth,
[0:10] there's going to be most all of this
[0:12] youth, I bet all of this youth will pass
[0:14] us up in revelation.
[0:17] There'll be young men that come up that
[0:18] can outreach me or any preacher that's
[0:20] ever preached in this pullpit with
[0:22] greater revelation, greater clarity,
[0:24] greater ability. And I want to be the
[0:26] place to fan them on and say, "Go, boy,
[0:27] go. I love it. It's great. I never saw
[0:30] that before. But thank God he brought it
[0:32] through you. Not to put them under thumb
[0:34] and say, "Well, you didn't get that from
[0:36] me and you didn't get learn it from me
[0:37] and I'm the master of every
[0:40] Come on. That's horrible." Amen. We want
[0:43] everybody to grow and reach their full
[0:45] potential. Amen. We want every life to
[0:48] reach its full potential. And the
[0:49] church, yes, we're supposed to be
[0:51] nurturing and loving and caregiving and
[0:53] create an environment. That's what mom
[0:55] does. She she creates an environment at
[0:57] home. Everybody wants to come home to
[0:59] mom's house.
[1:01] At least if you have a healthy
[1:02] relationship with mom and a good mom,
[1:05] everybody wants to come home to mom's
[1:06] house because mom creates that
[1:09] environment. Grand's connected. Mom's
[1:11] loving. But mom also won't let you
[1:14] suffer.
[1:19] It's dad who'll say, "Son, I think you
[1:22] could jump that creek."
[1:24] And mom's like, "No, they can't.
[1:27] son, let me help you build the ramp for
[1:29] your bike. I think you can go a little
[1:30] higher.
[1:34] And mom's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:36] What are you doing?" And say, "Shh, it's
[1:37] going to be okay." Cuz dad knows that
[1:39] boy's got to overcome. He's got to meet
[1:41] challenges. He's got to be willing to
[1:44] take a risk. But what if he falls down
[1:46] and hurts himself? What if he falls down
[1:48] and hurts himself? You know, God will
[1:50] stand and watch you fall down and hurt
[1:51] yourself. That's right. Yes, sir. But
[1:54] the church never will. That's right. The
[1:56] church never will. Amen. If you fall
[1:59] down and hurt yourself, guess what?
[2:01] You're going to have five or six people
[2:02] show up at the hospital and say, "Oh,
[2:04] brother, I'm so sorry. What happened to
[2:05] you? Let's pray together. Here's a
[2:07] basket of flowers. Here's a bunch of
[2:09] candy and chocolates."
[2:11] Cuz the church is a mother role. And we
[2:13] should do that. We shouldn't ever be any
[2:15] different than that. Amen. But God's the
[2:17] one who says, "Hey, stand back for a
[2:18] minute. This is my boy. I want to see if
[2:20] he can make the jump." Amen.
[2:27] That's why healthy, well-balanced
[2:29] children come out of a home with a
[2:30] mother and a father. And I believe
[2:33] healthy, well-balanced Christians come
[2:34] from a place where they've got the love
[2:36] and nurture and and affection of a of a
[2:38] church, a stable church that gather
[2:40] around them and love them and care for
[2:41] them. But they also are constantly
[2:43] pointed to the son, to the father. But
[2:45] father says, but father says, but father
[2:47] says, but father says. And if we don't
[2:49] know, let's ask father. Yeah.
