[10:44] pray let your word be established in the
[10:47] hearts of your children in Jesus
[10:49] Christ's name we pray
[10:51] amen
[10:53] amen God bless you while we're standing
[10:55] let's turn to Second Thessalonians
[10:58] together II Thessalonians chapter 3.
[11:01] just want to say we had a wonderful
[11:03] Memorial Day picnic on Monday and we
[11:05] appreciate all who were able to come out
[11:07] and the weather was absolutely perfect
[11:10] and I really want to express our
[11:12] gratitude to brother Ben and sister
[11:14] Amanda seybolt for not only just
[11:16] providing a place but they work really
[11:18] hard and we thank you both for that it
[11:20] was a special time for all of us and I
[11:22] left encouraged and I left blessed by it
[11:25] so thank you for that and I told brother
[11:26] Ben wherever he placed an order for that
[11:29] weather that he must place it again for
[11:31] our family retreat
[11:33] because I'd like the same exact weather
[11:35] to the T so it was wonderful and so we
[11:38] appreciate God for that
[11:40] amen let's look here in second
[11:42] Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 5 and
[11:45] we're going to be continuing with the
[11:46] thought of love not a part five but just
[11:48] in the same thought uh chapter 3 verse
[11:51] 5.
[11:53] and the Lord direct your hearts into the
[11:56] love of God
[11:58] and into the patient waiting for Christ
[12:01] may God bless you as your seeded
[12:05] it's amazing as we look at this subject
[12:07] of love it just continues to expand and
[12:10] as we've preached on it you know we've
[12:12] preached on it before we will preach on
[12:13] it again I'm sure because every time
[12:16] that we begin to look into the word of
[12:18] God and the word opens unto us on
[12:21] another level or we see it more uh more
[12:24] than we did before maybe more details or
[12:26] through more scriptures amen I I almost
[12:30] as I'm preaching as I'm meditating on
[12:33] these thoughts and preaching I'm almost
[12:35] a little bit remorseful because I
[12:37] realize I'm still missing something
[12:40] amen because the word of God is so rich
[12:42] amen there's so much to it there's no
[12:44] way amen every time God I used to be
[12:47] when God would unlock another layer and
[12:49] we would see it maybe in more vibrant
[12:51] color than we did before I used to think
[12:53] oh this is it now I've got the
[12:54] revelation of it but now as we've served
[12:57] God long enough and we've seen him
[12:58] Circle back over the same subjects and
[13:00] expand them again amen you realize we're
[13:03] never going to come to the end of this
[13:04] this is the word of God and it's Eternal
[13:06] and I'm thankful for that amen but but
[13:10] tonight I'd like to talk on the subject
[13:12] love is a powerful force
[13:14] love is a powerful force and we looked
[13:16] at this scripture in second
[13:18] Thessalonians Paul saying and the Lord
[13:19] direct your hearts into the love of God
[13:22] Amen and it's one of those things that
[13:25] you you think it seems so a simple the
[13:29] subject of love it seems so basic and it
[13:31] is basic but it's so profound at the
[13:33] same time it's so simple but so deep all
[13:36] at the same time and and Paul is praying
[13:39] that the Lord will direct your hearts
[13:40] into the love of God so it seems like
[13:43] this is something that you can
[13:44] constantly be directed deeper into and
[13:46] have more of and go further into amen
[13:49] and so that's what we ask God for Lord
[13:51] direct our heart into your love
[13:55] Amen brother Branham says in the message
[13:57] do you now believe all the way back in
[13:59] 1955
[14:01] . so now I'd like to just tell you what
[14:03] my secret of this great is what what
[14:05] how'd you like me to tell you tonight
[14:07] what I think is the greatest most
[14:09] powerful force there is on Earth
[14:11] would you like me to tell you about it
[14:13] in a few minutes you might not love me
[14:16] so after this because I will just tell
[14:18] you all the mightiest forced areas on
[14:20] Earth is love
[14:21] that's exactly there's nothing that will
[14:23] break down love no matter what it is
[14:26] amen let's go back to First Corinthians
[14:30] chapter 13.
[14:31] which is the the chapter of Charity
[14:34] First Corinthians chapter 13. we've read
[14:36] it several times but I really I want to
[14:39] read it again
[14:40] it keeps growing in my heart it keeps
[14:43] expanding to me
[14:46] First Corinthians chapter 13 I'm just
[14:48] going to pull a few excerpts from this
[14:49] my brother bam says the mind is forced
[14:51] ears on Earth is love there's nothing
[14:54] that will break down love
[14:56] I love that and so it becomes Dependable
[14:59] steadfast a mighty force and in in First
[15:03] Corinthians 13 verse 1 he says though I
[15:05] speak with the tongues of men and of
[15:06] angels and have not charity which is
[15:09] love agape love have not love I am
[15:11] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[15:14] symbol and though I have the gift of
[15:17] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[15:19] and all knowledge and though I have all
[15:22] Faith so that I could remove mountains
[15:25] and have not love I am nothing
[15:30] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[15:32] the poor and though I give my body to be
[15:34] burned and have not charity have not
[15:37] love it profiteth me nothing
[15:40] let's skip down to verse 8.
[15:44] charity never faileth that's what
[15:47] brother Branham says brother Branham
[15:49] says amen it's it's it's the greatest
[15:51] force and he says nothing will break
[15:53] down love and here Paul says love never
[15:57] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[15:59] they shall fail whether it be tongues
[16:01] they shall cease whether it be knowledge
[16:03] it shall vanish away now let's go down
[16:06] to verse 13.
[16:08] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[16:12] three but the greatest of these is
[16:14] charity
[16:15] is love
[16:17] it's the greatest amen that means that
[16:19] love is greater than Faith love is
[16:21] greater than hope love is the greatest
[16:23] of these three
[16:24] and and that's to me where my heart is
[16:28] that's what I want I want that love of
[16:31] God shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy
[16:33] Ghost and I want to be directed into the
[16:35] love of God and I want it to grow and
[16:37] expand within me until it takes full
[16:39] control of my being
[16:41] so I want to look at this amen for a
[16:44] little bit tonight
[16:46] in the message Divine love and Sovereign
[16:48] Grace the prophet of God says now we are
[16:50] faced in a day
[16:51] when it is prophesied to us that
[16:53] brotherly love will become a strange
[16:55] thing among people
[16:57] and it's to my humble belief that that
[16:59] is the greatest of all the gifts that
[17:01] there is in God's Bible if the Lord
[17:03] Jesus should stand on the platform
[17:05] tonight and look me in the face and say
[17:06] I'm going to give you your choice you
[17:08] can be a great person a great Minister
[17:10] I'll give you a gift of preaching the
[17:12] gospel I'll give you the gift of
[17:13] teaching the word I'll give you the gift
[17:15] of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift
[17:18] of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet
[17:19] or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of
[17:22] the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give
[17:24] them every one to you but when but then
[17:27] I will withhold love from you or either
[17:30] I'll give you love and withhold the gift
[17:32] from you
[17:33] I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let
[17:35] me have love
[17:37] amen see no matter how many gifts we got
[17:39] they will never do us any good except
[17:42] the love of God is the motive behind the
[17:44] gift
[17:45] we must have love so I love the way the
[17:48] prophet of God said that and I want I
[17:50] want to really I'm just going to read it
[17:52] again because it hit me with such in
[17:54] fact I've read this before a little time
[17:56] ago but Lord take all the gifts and let
[17:58] me have love no matter how many gifts
[18:00] we've got they will never do us any good
[18:03] except the love of God is the motive
[18:05] behind the gift
[18:08] hey man I I I think you know growing up
[18:11] I grew up in the Pentecostal church I
[18:14] grew up in and seen a lot of things
[18:16] experienced a lot of things uh uh that
[18:19] way and gifts and operation of gifts
[18:21] amen but so many times even as a child I
[18:24] would begin to see the wrong motive
[18:26] behind the gift
[18:28] you would see self-glorification
[18:31] with a true gift
[18:33] but self-glorification you'd see pride
[18:36] being mingled in with the gift and then
[18:39] you begin to see that that's the wrong
[18:41] motive for the gift
[18:43] and when the wrong motive is there amen
[18:45] it can take things the wrong direction
[18:47] because the wrong motive is behind it
[18:50] but I said God no matter what I have if
[18:54] I I want to come to the place the
[18:57] prophet of God is that if God would if
[18:59] it would have to be an exchange let's
[19:01] just say that way and I would have to
[19:02] exchange every spiritual gift I could
[19:05] have or even the gift of preaching and
[19:07] all of these things and give it up to
[19:08] have the true love of God I would give
[19:10] it all up and take the true love of God
[19:12] because that true love of God will see
[19:15] me all the way into the Finish Line amen
[19:17] and a gift can leave me destitute and
[19:19] spiritually bankrupt and backslidden on
[19:22] the side of the road
[19:23] a gift can leave me worse off
[19:27] because of the wrong motive is behind it
[19:29] and the devil can get in to where a
[19:31] gifted person is operating and begin to
[19:33] bring the wrong motive and begin to
[19:35] cause somebody to operate with the basis
[19:38] of Pride or jealousy Envy or Strife or
[19:41] want the vaunteth itself or or any of
[19:44] these things amen that gift being
[19:46] motivated by a wrong spirit with being
[19:49] being backed up by the wrong Spirit can
[19:52] leave you destitute and bankrupt on the
[19:54] side of the road
[19:58] but love never fail us
[20:01] and love will bring the right motive and
[20:03] then if God wants to operate any gift
[20:05] and God wants to get any gift after that
[20:07] if that gift can be motivated by love
[20:09] God's love the love of God Amen then
[20:13] that will be that gift will produce the
[20:16] right results
[20:18] amen
[20:20] if we if we look in Revelation let's
[20:23] just turn to Revelation chapter 3.
[20:27] oh no I'm sorry Revelation chapter 2
[20:30] and we'll look at the Ephesians Church
[20:31] age
[20:35] Revelation chapter 2.
[20:37] verse 2.
[20:39] it says I Know Thy Works thy labor and
[20:43] thy patience and how thou cast not bear
[20:45] them which are evil and thou has tried
[20:47] them which say they are Apostles and are
[20:49] not and has found them Liars
[20:52] and as born and has patience and for my
[20:54] name's sake has labored and has not
[20:56] fainted so so far the uh
[21:00] the Lord Jesus is speaking very positive
[21:03] things about the Ephesian Church age I
[21:05] Know Thy works I Know Thy labor I Know
[21:07] Thy patience I know how you cannot bear
[21:09] them which are evil now let's try them I
[21:12] mean you've done so many good things it
[21:15] has born and has patience and for my
[21:17] name's sake as labored and has not
[21:18] feigned in then he comes to verse four
[21:20] nevertheless I have someone against thee
[21:22] because thou has left thy first love
[21:26] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[21:28] fallen and repent and do the first works
[21:30] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[21:32] and remove thy Candlestick out of its
[21:34] place except thou repent
[21:37] he's saying you're doing good work
[21:39] you're laboring you're you're judging
[21:41] you're doing everything that you should
[21:42] do but I'm someone against you you've
[21:44] left your first love
[21:46] amen and brother Brandon makes this
[21:48] statement in the message the seven and
[21:51] the Seven Church ages from 1954. he says
[21:54] what's the matter at the Tabernacle a
[21:57] man ought to be able to say when you
[21:58] meet a man is your Christian experience
[22:01] when was it the dearest to you
[22:04] you ought to be able to say right now
[22:08] well my best experiences back when I
[22:11] first got the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[22:12] when I come
[22:13] and just oh brother you're falling from
[22:16] Grace that's right
[22:18] but the man says when you say back when
[22:20] I first received the baptism holy ghost
[22:22] that was the greatest experience of my
[22:24] life and brother remember says that's
[22:25] true then you're falling from Grace
[22:28] because we should be growing in Grace
[22:30] and growing in love and growing in a
[22:33] closer walk in relationship with the
[22:34] Lord Jesus all the time until when you
[22:36] say when was your greatest experience
[22:37] you say right now
[22:39] and we can't say right now then we need
[22:41] to repent and go back to our first love
[22:43] that's what had happened to his Ephesian
[22:45] age he said there was a little bit of a
[22:47] cooling off not that they were serving
[22:49] God not that they didn't have the works
[22:50] not they that weren't laboring in love
[22:52] not that they were not judging and not
[22:55] bearing them that were evil they were
[22:56] doing so much but they began to cool off
[22:59] in a little bit of formalism came in and
[23:01] they started getting into the church
[23:03] cycle of things
[23:04] [Music]
[23:06] and before it was never a church cycle
[23:09] it was a love for God that had him doing
[23:11] everything that they did
[23:14] I said God help me never fall into a
[23:17] church cycle into a church system and
[23:19] doing things because of the church I
[23:21] attend to or the group I fellowship with
[23:23] and Lord let that never that cold
[23:25] formalism and churchianity never let it
[23:28] come to me God but break me out of it
[23:30] because I want to be motivated by love
[23:32] for everything I do
[23:35] so many good things he could say
[23:38] but they begin to grow just a little bit
[23:40] formal
[23:42] amen and oh God I don't want to grow
[23:44] even just a little bit formal
[23:47] God help us
[23:50] in the message perfect faith
[23:53] where the man says and when we were
[23:54] Sinners alienated without God in the
[23:56] world in the muck of mud as I talked
[23:58] about this morning God came to us God
[24:00] sought you you never sought gone no man
[24:03] can come to me except the father draws
[24:05] him first and God come down in that muck
[24:07] what you were and sought you out and
[24:09] brought you out that ought to create a
[24:12] perfect love
[24:14] amen amen because if if we don't reflect
[24:18] on that and keep the realization of what
[24:21] we were and would have been without the
[24:24] mercy of God Amen then then it's amazing
[24:28] how the longer we walk with the Lord
[24:31] amen and we forget what we were could
[24:34] have been would have been without him
[24:36] interjecting himself in our life without
[24:39] that we can go to a little bit formal
[24:40] and become a little bit self-righteous
[24:44] amen
[24:46] but when we when we can recognize where
[24:49] would if we could just ask the question
[24:51] and allow our mind to wander where would
[24:54] I be if he hadn't injected himself
[24:57] in my life
[24:58] if he hadn't drawn me if he hadn't
[25:00] stopped the path I was on to him draw me
[25:03] and him bring me to This Light of the
[25:05] Gospel where would I be and if you just
[25:08] let your mind wander I was driving down
[25:10] the road the other day and and I was
[25:12] watching a a homeless man in Lima walk
[25:15] down the road and he was he was mentally
[25:17] ill he was so far gone either in alcohol
[25:20] or drugs or whatever it was he couldn't
[25:22] even walk straight speaking to himself
[25:24] and I thought and my heart broke and I
[25:26] began to cry and I said God Amen I could
[25:30] be there that could be me amen there's
[25:32] not I'm not here because I'm great I'm
[25:35] not holding my mind and sound amen I
[25:38] could be there amen and I've said before
[25:40] what separates us from the homeless man
[25:43] drunk in the ditch is maybe three or
[25:45] four bad decisions
[25:50] you make this wrong decision in that
[25:52] wrong decision and you go with the wrong
[25:54] group and you decide for the first time
[25:56] to partake in drugs and alcohol and you
[25:58] become an instant addict and and then
[26:00] and then all these things have what
[26:02] three or four bad decisions and you're
[26:04] in the same place that man's at
[26:10] and when we see those things
[26:12] that ought to create a perfect love
[26:16] for God what what would I have been what
[26:19] was I where was I going without him and
[26:21] how did I save myself and how did I
[26:23] bring myself to truth and how to
[26:26] no way
[26:28] that ought to create a perfect love
[26:30] it says look what you was look what you
[26:32] are what did that somebody that loved
[26:35] you
[26:36] can't you have faith in what he's
[26:38] promised you then real genuine love will
[26:42] we create create a confidence in his
[26:44] word
[26:45] it's what I love in this quote the
[26:47] statement a real genuine love will
[26:50] create confidence in his word
[26:55] amen let's go to the book of Galatians
[26:58] chapter 5 now
[27:15] one thing I have become
[27:17] in myself a little less tolerant of
[27:20] and I think it's because I found these
[27:23] Tendencies Within Myself
[27:26] and then when God exposed him to me I
[27:28] was frightened by the very thing I found
[27:31] within myself
[27:34] but this tendency
[27:36] to beat our chest
[27:40] and Proclaim how great we are
[27:45] the bride and we're Unstoppable and
[27:47] we're invincible and we're this and
[27:48] we're that
[27:50] and although the statements are true
[27:54] they're true because of the word of God
[27:57] and because of the plan of God and
[27:58] because of the decision of God they are
[28:01] not true because of us and our flesh and
[28:04] ourselves
[28:06] and the problem is sometimes the
[28:08] statement are made in self
[28:13] and and I've become so much less
[28:16] tolerant than that than I was because I
[28:18] found myself guilty of that and I became
[28:20] I began repulsed by my own attitude
[28:24] because it's it's not me and myself
[28:27] that's anything if there's anything
[28:28] Invincible about me it's the sieging of
[28:31] God God he placed in me and the word
[28:33] that he's ordained for that Gene to
[28:35] express and there's nothing in the world
[28:37] that'll stop that because of his love
[28:40] matter and it's not because I'm
[28:42] invincible and I'm great and I'm this
[28:44] and I'm the bride and I I'm everything I
[28:47] am because he decided to inject a part
[28:49] of himself in this Tabernacle of clay
[28:52] and he has a purpose and a plan for that
[28:58] so it's not the man in the mirror
[29:01] who's the great one it's not the man in
[29:04] the mirror that's going to overcome in
[29:05] this day it's the God who dwells inside
[29:10] amen so that's why we are such a paradox
[29:14] we in ourselves are such a paradox
[29:17] brother remember said the greatest enemy
[29:18] is God is William Branham the man he
[29:20] looks in the mirror that's my enemy but
[29:22] but but what's the greatest help I got
[29:24] the genuine me down on the inside he
[29:26] said down inside there was another
[29:27] William Branham
[29:29] so this William Branham in the mirrors
[29:31] the problem the genuine one the Son of
[29:33] God down on the inside that's the
[29:35] solution
[29:36] amen we are a walking paradox
[29:39] in Galatians chapter 5 verse 6. says for
[29:43] in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[29:45] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[29:48] Faith which worketh by love
[29:51] amen so if we have great faith how does
[29:54] faith work at workers by love
[29:56] brother M said in the message
[29:57] desperations now the word plainly states
[30:00] if you want to put this down in
[30:01] Galatians 5 6 that Faith workers by love
[30:03] see Faith worketh by love and the only
[30:05] way that you can have faith is have love
[30:08] first
[30:09] because after all faith is love and
[30:11] sinners incentive that's exactly what
[30:13] faith is it's an incentive to love now
[30:16] if you don't have love you can't have
[30:19] faith
[30:21] I mean that's why
[30:23] brother remember could say above all the
[30:24] gifts
[30:25] that's why Paul could say if I had Faith
[30:28] all faith that I can move mountains and
[30:31] have not charity I've become nothing
[30:34] man
[30:35] but if we have genuine love we'll have
[30:37] genuine faith
[30:39] okay he goes on in desperation to say
[30:41] that's the same thing that it is we must
[30:44] have love before we can have faith then
[30:46] we have genuine love what does it do it
[30:49] pushes our faith out on the Battlefront
[30:51] for God
[30:53] see genuine Godly love for God and for
[30:56] his word and for his people will push
[30:59] Faith out there love just takes a hold
[31:01] of faith and just come on let's go and
[31:04] out it goes because that's what love
[31:06] does
[31:08] that that's why love is Faith incentive
[31:11] it incentivizes Faith come on let's go
[31:13] he said it takes faith and pushes it out
[31:16] to the Forefront and puts it in action
[31:18] what is moving it love
[31:21] praise God that's why to have the love
[31:24] of God should have brought in our hearts
[31:25] by the Holy Ghost is the greatest thing
[31:27] to me that we can have
[31:29] because it'll bring everything else in
[31:31] line and in order let's go to Romans
[31:33] chapter 5.
[31:40] yeah we'll read this quick we've been
[31:43] quoting this all along but we'll read it
[31:44] again in Romans chapter 5 verse 5. I
[31:47] want us to know where this is in our
[31:49] Bibles so and hope maketh not a shame
[31:52] because the love of God is shed abroad
[31:54] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[31:56] given unto us
[31:58] thank God
[32:00] now let's go from here over to Ephesians
[32:03] 3.
[32:07] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14.
[32:16] for uh what did I say 14 yeah for this
[32:19] cause I bow my knees into the father of
[32:21] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[32:24] family in Heaven and Earth is named that
[32:26] he would Grant you according to the
[32:28] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[32:30] with might by his spirit in the inner
[32:32] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[32:34] by faith that ye being rooted and
[32:37] grounded in love love is a rooting and a
[32:41] grounding
[32:42] it's an establishing Force it'll be it
[32:45] will root us and ground us that we can
[32:46] be rooted and grounded in love now you
[32:49] may be able to comprehend with All
[32:51] Saints what is the breath and length and
[32:53] depth and height and to know the love of
[32:55] Christ Christ which passes knowledge
[32:58] that you might be filled with all the
[33:00] fullness of God now unto him that is
[33:03] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[33:05] all that we ask or think according to
[33:07] the power that worketh in US
[33:12] what where is this great power
[33:16] that comes on the scene
[33:19] where is this great power that we need
[33:21] in times of trouble where is this great
[33:24] force amen that we need to overcome I'll
[33:28] read it again in verse 20. now unto him
[33:30] that is able to do exceedingly
[33:32] abundantly above all that we ask or
[33:34] think so when we pray and when we even
[33:36] when we even he can do more abundantly
[33:39] than we can ask or think
[33:41] even when we pray sometimes he'll
[33:43] surprise us in the answer
[33:45] because he can do beyond what we can ask
[33:47] or think
[33:49] so this one that can do abundantly above
[33:52] all that we ask or think according how
[33:55] will he do it according to the power
[33:57] that worketh in US
[34:00] how will God do the amazing things that
[34:03] he'll do according to the power that
[34:04] worketh in US
[34:06] it's amazing to me and and how will I
[34:10] know all of this because uh Christ will
[34:12] be in My Heart by faith and I will be
[34:14] rooted and grounded in love to know amen
[34:17] the great revelation of Christ
[34:19] but this power that will work in us
[34:21] we're going to look at that as we go on
[34:23] don't forget that statement according to
[34:26] the power that worketh in US
[34:29] President says from that from the
[34:31] message from that time in 61 he says I
[34:33] don't know how long I'll be with you I
[34:36] don't know about that but
[34:38] I'll tell you a little secret
[34:40] the most powerful force in the world
[34:42] isn't speaking with tongues or
[34:44] interpreting tongues are being being
[34:46] honored by God to be a minister or to be
[34:47] an evangelist or to be a prophet
[34:49] the most powerful weapon that I've ever
[34:52] found in my life is love
[34:56] in the message Jesus Christ is same
[34:58] yesterday today and forever it says I've
[35:00] been a minister for 31 years I've seen
[35:03] all kinds of gifts I've seen God do
[35:05] great things
[35:06] but the greatest thing I ever seen in my
[35:08] life was love
[35:10] it's the most powerful force that stops
[35:12] anything there is is love love that
[35:15] moved a mighty God God so loved the
[35:17] world that he gave his only begotten son
[35:19] love is a great keynote that we leave
[35:23] out it's something that's eternal
[35:28] is telling us in all of his experiences
[35:31] 31 years of ministry the greatest gift
[35:33] the greatest thing is not to be a
[35:35] prophet is not to be an evangelist it's
[35:37] not to have all these gifts the greatest
[35:39] thing the most powerful force is love
[35:42] it says sometimes what we leave out
[35:45] but it's something that's Eternal so
[35:48] let's go back and look at our scripture
[35:49] we've been looking at in first John
[35:50] chapter 4.
[35:53] first John chapter 4.
[36:01] first John
[36:03] chapter 4
[36:06] verse 16.
[36:09] we've been all over these scriptures
[36:11] through the book of First John
[36:15] but he says in first John 4 16
[36:18] and we have known and believed the love
[36:20] that God hath to us
[36:22] God is love
[36:24] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[36:26] God and God in him
[36:29] this is how I believe brother Benham
[36:31] could say and I know it is because
[36:32] there's a quote that says so the most
[36:34] powerful force there is is love
[36:36] why because John says God is love
[36:40] and God is the most powerful force there
[36:42] is and God is love and love is gone
[36:45] so if we have love we have God if we
[36:48] abide in love we abide in God if love
[36:51] abides in us then God abides in US
[36:56] let's read it again
[36:58] and we have known and believed the love
[37:01] that God hath to us God is love and he
[37:04] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[37:05] and God in him hearing is our love made
[37:08] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[37:09] day of judgment because as he is so are
[37:12] we in this world
[37:15] he is so are we in this world
[37:18] and remember he says that that God can
[37:22] work I want to I just want to refer back
[37:25] to the scripture we read in Ephesians 3
[37:28] 19 or Ephesians 3 20. now unto him that
[37:32] is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[37:34] all that we ask or think according to
[37:36] the power that worketh in US
[37:39] and now we come back to this love that
[37:42] is in us and herein is our love made
[37:44] perfect then we have boldness in the day
[37:46] of judgment because as he is so are we
[37:48] in this world
[37:50] because why if the love of God abides in
[37:52] us where is God
[37:54] and where is God's power where is God's
[37:56] Force it's working within us
[38:00] the same love amen that he created the
[38:03] world is in US amen the the same love
[38:05] that gave His only begotten son for
[38:08] salvation to pay the price of redemption
[38:10] to redeem back the Fallen World to erase
[38:12] when Adam lost and restored back the
[38:14] title deed that was love the love the
[38:16] love of God God so loved the world he
[38:18] gave his only begotten son and where is
[38:20] thy love that love is abiding amen is
[38:23] shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[38:25] ghost that love is abiding in US
[38:27] it may it abide more and more may we
[38:30] walk into that love and grow into that
[38:31] life
[38:34] amen
[38:36] so he goes on to say
[38:39] now in verse 18 there is no fear in love
[38:43] this is I want to spend a little bit of
[38:45] time on this
[38:47] there is no fear in love
[38:49] but perfect love cast out fear
[38:53] because fear hath torment he that
[38:55] feareth is not made perfect in love we
[38:58] love him because he first loved us
[39:01] if a man say I love God and hated his
[39:03] brother he's a liar for he that loveth
[39:05] not his brother whom he hath seen how
[39:07] can he love God whom he hath not seen
[39:09] and this commandment have we from him
[39:12] that he who loveth God loveth his
[39:14] brother also
[39:16] so I want to go to back to verse 18. now
[39:20] we'll talk about this for a minute there
[39:22] is no fear in love but perfect love cast
[39:24] out fear because fear of Torment he that
[39:27] feareth is not made perfect in love
[39:30] we love him because he first loved us
[39:34] amen he loved us and he gave of himself
[39:37] for us making a way where he could dwell
[39:40] within us in the love of God can be shed
[39:42] abroad in our hearts and it's a
[39:45] reciprocating love God loved us we love
[39:47] him and and
[39:48] he that feareth
[39:51] there is no fear in love
[39:53] but perfect love cast out fear
[39:56] and I don't want to drive into that to
[39:59] the in a legalistic mindset where we
[40:01] said but I was afraid the other day so I
[40:04] I don't have perfect love now we have to
[40:07] realize that that there's an outer man
[40:09] and an inner man
[40:12] and the outer man is the flesh man and
[40:14] he consists of the Flesh and the spirit
[40:16] is the outer man but the inner man is
[40:18] the soul amen where the spirit of God is
[40:20] quick and the seed of God the life and
[40:22] that's growing amen and is growing and
[40:25] taking over but we still have an outer
[40:28] man and the outer man can experience
[40:30] negative emotions
[40:32] the honor of man can be afraid you can
[40:34] hear a doctor say something to you and
[40:36] you can be afraid
[40:38] you can have an experience on the road
[40:41] where you're nearly hit and you can be
[40:43] afraid you can see your children amen
[40:45] stepping into a dangerous situation and
[40:47] you can be afraid amen but that outer
[40:49] man is going to perish it's going to
[40:51] fade away it's going to be changed Amen
[40:54] in the twinkling of an eye amen so the
[40:56] outer man is not the man that we're
[40:58] focusing on it's the inner man amen and
[41:00] that inner man amen perfect love is
[41:03] casting out fear and may the Inner Man
[41:04] dominate the outer man and bring the
[41:07] outer man subject to the Inner Man
[41:10] her perfect love cast out fear because
[41:14] fear had torment
[41:16] he was afraid he's not made perfect in
[41:19] love
[41:19] amen so we must grow the inner man must
[41:23] grow we must grow into these things and
[41:25] tell it that it begins to display what's
[41:27] on the inside comes on the outside and
[41:29] the outside is brought subject to the
[41:31] inside
[41:33] so
[41:35] I mean how many times even in great
[41:37] testimonies that we hear amen the
[41:39] initial response to an action would be
[41:42] fear but then something inside will well
[41:44] up and we'll remember the Lord and
[41:45] remember a verse and remember something
[41:47] that happened and all of a sudden Faith
[41:49] would rise to the occasion conquer the
[41:51] fear on the outside man amen and Faith
[41:53] would take its place and what's faith
[41:56] and sin of love
[41:58] amen and then all of a sudden now you're
[42:01] not afraid of the diagnosis you're not
[42:02] afraid of the situation You're Not
[42:04] Afraid amen because something inside
[42:06] took charge and dominated the situation
[42:09] amen and Faith took its place because
[42:11] love grabs faith and puts it on the
[42:13] Forefront
[42:15] and then fear moves to the side
[42:20] we're gonna see this I want to spend
[42:22] some time looking at this in the and and
[42:25] some stories of brother Branham
[42:28] and he preaches a message Called Love in
[42:30] 1956 and I'm going to read quite a
[42:33] little bit out of this uh message I'm
[42:36] going to quite a lengthy quote but bear
[42:37] with me
[42:38] and he's going to start by speaking
[42:40] about a circumstance he ran into with a
[42:43] killer bull we all know it but there's
[42:45] some things I want to highlight some
[42:47] things that really stood out to me this
[42:49] time around and and he knew that there
[42:52] was a killer Bull in this field it had
[42:53] been somewhere else and it had killed a
[42:55] man and it got sold and was moved to
[42:57] this location and he was there working
[42:59] for the Department of Natural Resources
[43:01] he was a game ward he was going to
[43:02] release some fish and then there was a
[43:04] man that he wanted to pray for so he's
[43:06] going to cross this field and he had
[43:08] forgot that the bull was there and he
[43:10] says I unbuckled this old pistol
[43:12] and I throwed it up in the car
[43:15] and I went over there started across the
[43:17] field where the brother was I forgot
[43:19] that the killer was in the field
[43:22] so on my road across the field over
[43:24] going across that way there was a little
[43:26] bunch of shrubs out there little scrub
[43:28] Oaks and I happened to get about 200
[43:30] yards or 300 yards from the fence about
[43:32] the same distance the other side little
[43:35] swamp of a pond in the middle there and
[43:37] all of a sudden within 30 feet of me
[43:39] this killer bull raised up and there I
[43:41] was
[43:42] first I reached for the gun no gun
[43:46] I want you to look at brother Van's
[43:48] initial response
[43:50] that would have been my initial response
[43:54] he writes for the gun a human effort to
[43:57] save himself
[44:01] I reached for the gun no gun
[44:03] see how God takes care of things just
[44:05] right no gun I looked to the fence he
[44:09] was too close to me no tree to get into
[44:10] death laid before me he was a killer
[44:13] warnings all around don't enter here
[44:15] well I forgot about it and there I was
[44:18] well there's only one thing for me to do
[44:20] straighten myself up and don't die like
[44:22] a coward
[44:24] die like a man
[44:25] I love the prophet of God I just love
[44:28] him as an individual I love him as a man
[44:31] don't die like a cow or die like a man
[44:32] I'd love to be able to say that in that
[44:34] situation but I I don't know I'd
[44:36] probably been screaming and running
[44:40] straighten myself up it
[44:43] see this is the mindset that he's in
[44:46] there's a killer there I can't I go for
[44:49] the gun there's no gun
[44:51] I'm gonna die
[44:53] but I don't want to die like all this is
[44:56] all the human element
[44:58] this is all the outer man
[45:02] I straightened myself up I thought well
[45:04] this is the end of it pull myself up no
[45:06] need of trying to run he was in is in 20
[45:09] feet of me just throwed his horns in the
[45:11] ground like that and bellowed with all
[45:12] he could fall on his knees and throwed
[45:14] his horns and kick the dirt and getting
[45:16] ready so I was just standing there
[45:19] that's all I could do I thought well I
[45:20] certainly will do this I will not go
[45:22] down a coward I'll go down showing my
[45:25] love of God in my heart and I look back
[45:27] at that bull and all of the sudden
[45:30] something happened
[45:32] this is what I want to focus on right
[45:34] now this was not the human element
[45:37] this was not the man
[45:40] we cannot listen we cannot look to
[45:43] brother banham and look at him and say
[45:45] that was wonderful how brother Branham
[45:47] loved the bull no this was something
[45:49] more than the man
[45:53] I want us to see that because if we
[45:55] leave it in the flesh we think oh he's
[45:57] come to a position he's come to a place
[45:58] the prophet of God and we put him there
[46:01] and leave ourselves out of it amen but
[46:03] he is no different than you and I as
[46:05] children of God
[46:06] he's not in any different position he's
[46:08] not amen he's not a different kind of
[46:11] person he's a Son of God Amen in the
[46:13] same possibilities are here for you and
[46:15] I
[46:18] and he says all of a sudden something
[46:20] happened
[46:21] I love this we're going to read this as
[46:22] we go it's going to it's going to catch
[46:24] on you're going to catch what I'm saying
[46:26] something happened he didn't work
[46:28] himself into something he didn't push
[46:30] himself into something and he didn't try
[46:33] to produce something
[46:35] this was not a human effort to produce
[46:38] something this wasn't something he
[46:40] conjured up or he did or thought that I
[46:42] had better amen in US twinkling of an
[46:44] eye in a flash when he faced death
[46:46] something happened
[46:50] now this sounds kiddish
[46:52] it sounds like a little baby talk
[46:55] but that's when the trouble with us
[46:57] tonight we try to being an adult in God
[46:59] when we ought to be babies in God
[47:02] we know so much God dwells in the center
[47:04] of humility and simplicity don't never
[47:07] forget that I looked at the bull if
[47:09] anything I could have cried for him
[47:13] why I thought poor creature well how
[47:17] wrong am I
[47:19] now ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way
[47:21] about it
[47:23] ordinarily I wouldn't feel that way
[47:25] about it
[47:28] you know
[47:32] the man
[47:34] wretched for his gun
[47:37] the man had an uh oh moment
[47:41] oh no this is bad
[47:45] I'm going to die but I'll take it like a
[47:48] man not like a coward
[47:50] but then all of a sudden something
[47:53] happened
[47:55] and when that something happened
[47:57] he could have cried for the bull
[48:01] listen this is Supernatural
[48:06] he could have went for the bull and look
[48:09] at what happened when the love of God
[48:10] came on the scene he was looking from
[48:13] the Bull's perspective now listen don't
[48:16] leave this in Bulls
[48:18] let's bring this right down to daily
[48:20] life all of a sudden something happened
[48:22] and he looked at it from the other
[48:25] position
[48:27] and he said how wrong am I now he's
[48:32] going to take the blame for this problem
[48:34] for this situation
[48:38] said well how wrong I am now ordinarily
[48:41] I wouldn't feel that way about it first
[48:43] I was looking for the gun I was glad I
[48:46] didn't have it I'd have shot him
[48:48] and then went and paid for it but I
[48:51] didn't have the gun I thought well poor
[48:53] creature
[48:54] I'm in your pasture this is your home
[48:56] and you're just a brute you don't know
[48:58] any different
[49:00] listen if brother Branham can do that
[49:03] for a bull can you do that for a
[49:04] co-worker
[49:07] a family member a loved one somebody
[49:09] else in the church
[49:13] you don't know any different and you
[49:15] wouldn't want to kill me anyhow but I
[49:17] Disturbed you I'm sorry I did that I
[49:19] didn't mean to disturb you talking like
[49:22] I am now I just couldn't listen
[49:25] I just couldn't help it there was
[49:27] something talking in me
[49:32] this wasn't the man this was God in the
[49:35] man
[49:37] I just couldn't help it there was
[49:39] something talking in me
[49:43] oh my it's too bad we ever have to leave
[49:46] that
[49:48] just submit to it God just took over
[49:51] and the bull roaring and going on he
[49:53] lowered his head and he said now
[49:55] creature of God I'm the servant of God
[49:57] I'm on my way to pray for a sick man
[49:59] over here dying and I come across the
[50:01] field here where your home is I'm sorry
[50:04] I broke into your home that's what I did
[50:06] I broke into his home that's all the
[50:08] home he knows of now stop and think
[50:11] that's true
[50:12] I said I come into your house I broke in
[50:14] on you I'm sorry you forgive me
[50:17] I'll go across the field I won't bother
[50:20] you and I said now in the name of Jesus
[50:22] Christ our creator go over there and lay
[50:24] down again I'll not bother you and that
[50:26] bull took towards me as hard as he could
[50:28] and when he got to about six or eight
[50:30] feet of me I wasn't a bit more afraid
[50:33] than I am standing right here perfect
[50:36] love cast out all fear
[50:40] this is what first John's talking about
[50:43] this is not our effort amen this is God
[50:46] this is the love of God this is the
[50:48] reality on the inside not something we
[50:51] put on that we paste on I paste on love
[50:54] your love will fall off when you face a
[50:56] killer bull
[50:57] all your stick on religious statements
[51:00] amen they fall off
[51:03] I'm the bride and I'm invincible and I'm
[51:05] this or that amen wait till you get to
[51:07] the hour of trouble and see whether it's
[51:10] genuine or not whether it's a velcro
[51:12] stick on title or whether it's the
[51:14] reality that's in the soul
[51:15] [Applause]
[51:17] [Music]
[51:18] I don't want a label I don't want to
[51:20] stick on title I don't want to claim I'm
[51:22] this this and this and that you know
[51:25] what I am I am nothing without the grace
[51:27] of God left to myself I destroy myself I
[51:30] was going the wrong way with all my
[51:31] thinking I've ruined everything amen but
[51:34] the grace of God has injected himself
[51:35] every time I get myself in trouble he's
[51:38] brought me out
[51:41] and so I have nothing to stick on myself
[51:43] whatever I am is what I am in my soul
[51:46] amen what God has made me to be from
[51:48] before the foundation of the world and
[51:50] what his word is bringing me into the
[51:52] image of it's got to be him and not me
[51:56] so
[52:00] we St I mean
[52:02] friends Peter stuck some labels on
[52:04] himself
[52:07] Peter I'm brave and I'll not fail you
[52:10] and though all men leave you need I
[52:13] won't forsake you
[52:16] foreign
[52:18] oh my goodness there's so much prep pep
[52:21] rally preaching
[52:25] but there's got to be a reality
[52:28] and I want the reality not we all pass
[52:31] out labels we're this we're Invincible
[52:33] we're this we're this no I I I'm only
[52:36] that if God's made me that I'm only that
[52:38] I'm
[52:40] God's I'm only as big as God's big in me
[52:43] I'm only as powerful as God's powerful
[52:45] in me
[52:48] here's the prophet of God going to shoot
[52:51] the bull scared going to die but
[52:53] something changed and now he has
[52:54] sympathy for the bull
[52:56] you know when God first created Eden it
[53:00] was a it was a world of perfection
[53:01] perfect love perfect love to vote
[53:04] everywhere and there was harmony with
[53:06] the animals amongst themselves and
[53:08] amongst people amen but what happened
[53:10] amen man fell from perfect love and then
[53:13] all of the trouble that we see is
[53:15] because evil entered into the world and
[53:17] what is evil evil is not a creation evil
[53:20] is a perversion
[53:22] it's righteousness perverted now the
[53:24] wrong love has come in and a perverted
[53:25] love and has twisted everything and now
[53:28] there's enmity between the Beast and
[53:30] between men that wasn't there in a world
[53:32] of perfect love
[53:33] and if someday it won't be there in the
[53:36] future in a world of perfect love
[53:38] so what what was it that that bull
[53:41] encountered that bull encountered what
[53:43] the original thought of bull was
[53:45] intended to be Amen in harmony with mad
[53:47] and love
[53:49] and perfect love amen confuse the bull
[53:56] I mean that bull has no consciousness of
[53:59] a a feeling and sorting out his feelings
[54:02] and he doesn't understand the words that
[54:05] the prophet is speaking but it's the
[54:07] love being projected and when love is
[54:09] projected Sovereign Grace takes its
[54:11] place and the bull goes over and lays
[54:13] down what force moved him over it was
[54:15] the love of God the same force that kept
[54:18] Harmony and Eden
[54:24] amen
[54:31] oh my goodness
[54:35] he says now he says I come into your
[54:37] house broke in on you I'm sorry
[54:40] you forgive me
[54:43] he's asking the bull to forgive him
[54:50] what are we looking at we're looking at
[54:53] the operation of perfect love
[54:58] forgive me I'll go across the field I
[55:00] won't bother you
[55:03] he said I wasn't a bit more afraid than
[55:05] I am standing right here perfect love
[55:07] cast out all fear
[55:10] I don't care if death is staring in the
[55:12] face you can sing happy day happy day
[55:15] since Jesus washed my sins away
[55:19] listen that's not trying to not be
[55:21] afraid
[55:23] many people
[55:25] me included I've tried to be a brave
[55:28] Christian
[55:29] when facing difficult situations and
[55:31] I've tried to be brave and I've tried
[55:33] I've tried to trust God and I mean with
[55:36] all that's in me I was trusting God I
[55:37] was trying to be brave trying not to be
[55:39] afraid but you can't stop that quivering
[55:42] in your heart
[55:43] no matter what you put out you can't
[55:46] stop that shaking on the inside it's
[55:49] going to take something Supernatural
[55:51] it's going to take something that's God
[55:53] to actually drive fear away until you
[55:56] can stand like the problems that I was
[55:57] no more afraid in that situation than I
[55:59] am standing right here
[56:03] said no wonder Paul could stand in the
[56:05] face of death and say oh death wears
[56:07] your staying grave where is your victory
[56:09] sure through tribulations he had learned
[56:12] the love of God how did he learn the
[56:14] love of God through tribulations
[56:17] suffering brings patience Works
[56:19] tribulation to bring patience of course
[56:21] now patience makes love trust
[56:24] and when that bull got within about six
[56:26] or eight feet of me he just threw his
[56:28] feet out and stopped and he looked at me
[56:30] he looked this way that way so depleted
[56:34] just quieting right down walked over and
[56:36] laid down I walked within five feet of
[56:39] that bull and he never even turned and
[56:41] looked at me I walked right out of the
[56:43] pasture what is it it was the love of
[56:45] God the power of God
[56:50] where was the power of God working it
[56:52] was working in him
[56:53] Amen in brother banham where was that
[56:55] power of Deliverance it was in him where
[56:57] was it working it was working in him
[57:03] that's what Ephesians was telling us in
[57:06] Ephesians chapter 3 it says according to
[57:09] the power that worketh in us he can do
[57:12] exceedingly more than we can ask and
[57:13] think according to the power that works
[57:15] in us what power his power working in US
[57:20] Why move that bull over the lay down
[57:25] it was the power of God
[57:29] amen
[57:32] you say brother Madam I don't believe
[57:33] that story well you don't have to but
[57:35] it's true the same God that would close
[57:37] the mouth of the Lions and the Lion's
[57:39] Den for Daniel can certain tame a bull
[57:42] in a few minutes when the love of God
[57:43] has been projected then when I love the
[57:46] Lord and the love in my heart comes back
[57:48] to that bull then when love has come to
[57:51] its end Divine Sovereign Grace steps in
[57:53] and takes the place hallelujah oh my why
[57:56] would I fear when death comes how I want
[57:59] to love the Lord that when it comes to
[58:01] the place where everything is gone
[58:02] divine grace will step in someday and
[58:04] pack me across the river of Jordan
[58:06] Yonder into a better land where there's
[58:08] no sickness or death or sorrow I love
[58:10] the Lord you love the Lord we have got
[58:13] nothing no sickness no diseases nothing
[58:15] else can separate us that love of God
[58:17] goes right on and when you love him and
[58:20] come to the end where love can't act no
[58:23] longer on your behalf Sovereign Grace
[58:25] will take Love's place
[58:28] and God will inject himself in the
[58:31] situation
[58:32] here's some time ago out in my front
[58:34] yard I was mowing with a mowing machine
[58:37] little old power mower and I'd mow about
[58:40] two rounds and here come another car
[58:41] load I'd run around the house and run in
[58:43] put take off my overalls and put them in
[58:45] clothes and somebody come to be prayed
[58:47] for I'd pray for them maybe they're an
[58:49] hour or more nobody else in line then
[58:51] maybe in the late evening I'd slip out
[58:53] put my overalls on run out the front
[58:55] yard mow a couple more rounds while the
[58:57] front yard was growing up before I could
[58:58] get in the back
[59:00] one afternoon back there I went back
[59:02] there and and I just slipped on my
[59:04] overalls real hot I didn't put on any
[59:06] shirt nobody could see me so I was just
[59:08] mowing along there the little old power
[59:10] mower putt putt Putt-Putt and I was
[59:12] going along and I forgot that a big nest
[59:14] of hornets was in the corner and I
[59:16] rammed right into that fence and in less
[59:18] than a second time I was completely
[59:21] covered over with Hornets
[59:22] you know what they are those great Big
[59:24] Fellas why they could kill you one of
[59:26] them could knock you down and of course
[59:27] me with no shirt on the Hornets all
[59:29] around me but something happened here it
[59:32] comes again something happened
[59:38] instead of being scared a love came in
[59:41] and took its place
[59:44] you might not want to believe this but
[59:46] at the Judgment bar you'll see him when
[59:48] the secrets of our hearts is disclosed
[59:51] I was covered over not a one had stung
[59:54] me and I thought poor little creatures
[59:57] well that's the only way you have a
[59:59] defense God gave you that Stinger that's
[1:00:01] to defend yourself you've got just as
[1:00:03] much right you don't know that was my
[1:00:05] fence it's just as much yours as it is
[1:00:08] mine it don't belong to either one of us
[1:00:11] it's God so you made your nest right
[1:00:13] there oh ought to have been looking out
[1:00:15] for you and I'm sorry but I said I'm the
[1:00:17] servant of the Lord and I love you
[1:00:18] little fellas
[1:00:21] them just humming buzzing all over I
[1:00:24] said don't you try to Bluff it
[1:00:27] here's what he said don't you try to
[1:00:28] Bluff it
[1:00:29] this is no Hey listen words ain't going
[1:00:32] to get this done
[1:00:34] slogans and and phrases and and pounding
[1:00:37] the chest that's not going to work in
[1:00:39] this situation
[1:00:41] don't you try to Bluff it
[1:00:44] you better know what you're talking
[1:00:45] about I said I love you little creatures
[1:00:47] of God I'm sorry I apologize to you for
[1:00:51] waking you up
[1:00:52] but I said I'm serving God's people and
[1:00:55] I have to cut my grass and I was in a
[1:00:57] hurry I'm sorry I Disturbed you now in
[1:00:59] the name of Jesus Christ go back into
[1:01:01] that Nest I won't bother you anymore
[1:01:03] I'll go around it and then still around
[1:01:05] me my mower never stopped I just turned
[1:01:08] loose the handle raised my hands to God
[1:01:10] I took right a hold of the handles and I
[1:01:12] and not a bit more scared of them
[1:01:14] Hornets than nothing and God my
[1:01:17] sovereign judge them Hornets made a few
[1:01:18] rounds around me and made a beeline just
[1:01:20] as straight back into that Nest as they
[1:01:22] could go what was it the projecting of
[1:01:25] love of God brought down the Sovereign
[1:01:27] Grace of God not the projecting of
[1:01:30] brother branham's love but the
[1:01:31] projecting of the love of God
[1:01:35] and somehow how would I know that with
[1:01:38] me speaking in English they didn't hear
[1:01:41] down the interpretation and they heard
[1:01:43] what I said I can't tell you but anyhow
[1:01:46] they obeyed the very word
[1:01:48] I asked him in Jesus Christ's name to do
[1:01:50] love it conquers animals it conquers
[1:01:53] human beings
[1:01:57] he says you don't try to Bluff it
[1:02:00] there's no making this is this this is
[1:02:03] not the realm of pretend
[1:02:05] this is reality this is not a human
[1:02:08] emotion this is not a human love amen
[1:02:10] there's something much more than that
[1:02:12] amen because in the human realm I I
[1:02:15] don't know about you but if it was me I
[1:02:17] know what would happen to me and and and
[1:02:19] and the natural man the natural realm
[1:02:21] without God injecting himself in the
[1:02:23] situation and doing something for me
[1:02:26] amen but brother Brown had that where
[1:02:28] something changed but if I was in that
[1:02:30] situation and I didn't have whether
[1:02:31] something changed I couldn't even
[1:02:33] probably repeat to you the names that I
[1:02:34] would call those Hornets
[1:02:38] and the things that I would say and
[1:02:40] anger and frustration and fear and I'd
[1:02:42] call them dumb Hornets you go away and
[1:02:44] leave me alone and
[1:02:46] but when the love of God injected itself
[1:02:50] the love of God didn't make the Hornets
[1:02:53] an enemy
[1:02:56] they didn't make the Hornet something to
[1:02:57] be hated they made the Hornet something
[1:03:00] to be sympathized with and pitied and
[1:03:02] loved
[1:03:05] my goodness this is Light Years Beyond
[1:03:07] human
[1:03:09] this is not human amen this is not our
[1:03:12] efforts this is not us trying to be
[1:03:14] loving you can try to be loving all you
[1:03:16] want amen but at some point it's going
[1:03:18] to break it's going to fizzle amen your
[1:03:20] love the human love is not strong enough
[1:03:22] to handle some of these circumstances
[1:03:24] but oh praise God something changed
[1:03:26] something happened in a moment's time
[1:03:28] the whole atmosphere Chained and brother
[1:03:30] Ben instead of being angry and afraid he
[1:03:32] was loving and had sympathy and began to
[1:03:35] apologize to Hornets
[1:03:37] apologize to a bull
[1:03:42] I said God that's the love that I need
[1:03:46] but that's the power that I believe is
[1:03:48] shed abroad in our hearts by the I
[1:03:50] believe it's there but listen what
[1:03:52] brought love to the Forefront it was the
[1:03:55] obstacle that brought love to the
[1:03:57] Forefront
[1:03:58] what was it that displayed the love of
[1:04:00] God it was the need for the love of God
[1:04:03] it was the great adversity that produced
[1:04:06] the great love
[1:04:08] we think of all these trials and these
[1:04:10] Temptations and the difficult things we
[1:04:12] go through we look at them as bad things
[1:04:14] they're not bad things they're good
[1:04:15] things friends we absolutely need them
[1:04:18] amen because the promises are to them
[1:04:19] that overcometh how will you reach how
[1:04:22] will you receive the promise if you
[1:04:23] don't overcome how will you overcome
[1:04:25] with no trial
[1:04:27] and then how will the love of God be
[1:04:29] expressed amen if your human love is
[1:04:32] enough to carry you through every
[1:04:34] circumstance and you can retain your
[1:04:36] emotions and you can hold back your fear
[1:04:37] and all of these things you can do
[1:04:39] yourself how will the love of God ever
[1:04:41] be expressed no I'm telling your friends
[1:04:43] the love of God will be expressed when
[1:04:45] we've gone beyond human amen beyond the
[1:04:47] ability when the situation is so serious
[1:04:50] and so intense and so fearful and so
[1:04:52] dangerous amen that there's no way a
[1:04:55] human being can endure that's when
[1:04:57] something will happen
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:02] I wonder many times that that's why
[1:05:04] brother Branham says you wait till this
[1:05:06] Council Begins the title you wait for
[1:05:07] these things then you'll see what you've
[1:05:09] seen temporarily manifest in fullness of
[1:05:10] power not because human beings are going
[1:05:13] to be able to do it but because the
[1:05:15] circumstance will get to the situation
[1:05:17] where nothing else can do but the the
[1:05:19] but the perfect love of God producing
[1:05:22] the third pool
[1:05:23] not a human brain not human emotions not
[1:05:26] we finally got ourselves to Perfection
[1:05:28] we will never get ourselves to
[1:05:30] Perfection it'll be the love of God
[1:05:32] being perfected within us
[1:05:37] and we've seen it here it's been
[1:05:39] displayed to us amen and I thank God now
[1:05:43] that we know we don't have to produce
[1:05:45] him we don't have to fake anything we
[1:05:46] don't have to work anything up we don't
[1:05:48] have to keep trying and trying and
[1:05:50] trying there's no trying to produce this
[1:05:52] amen the only thing we're trying to do
[1:05:54] is surrender more surrender more
[1:05:56] surrender more so that he can take a
[1:05:58] greater portion of me and feed more on
[1:06:01] the word and stay in the washing of the
[1:06:03] water of the word so that it can get
[1:06:05] more of me out of me so in times of
[1:06:08] trouble there's something planted deep
[1:06:10] within me that could come to the
[1:06:11] Forefront
[1:06:13] I can't produce this all I can do is
[1:06:15] open myself up and say God I need more
[1:06:18] of you
[1:06:19] I need you to lead me further into your
[1:06:22] love
[1:06:23] amen I need
[1:06:25] Your Love Shadow brought in my heart in
[1:06:28] Greater measure than it's ever been
[1:06:29] before because I'm going to meet things
[1:06:32] in my life that I cannot humanly
[1:06:34] overcome I need you amen planted deep
[1:06:37] within me I need you to come on the
[1:06:39] scene
[1:06:43] because God can do exceedingly
[1:06:45] abundantly more than we can ask or think
[1:06:47] according to his mighty power which
[1:06:49] worketh in
[1:06:51] us
[1:06:55] so that means I need him
[1:06:58] in me
[1:07:02] I need him and me
[1:07:04] and I need as much
[1:07:07] as I can stay surrendered by his grace
[1:07:10] stay surrendered to him so that he can
[1:07:13] take preeminence in me
[1:07:15] so in the hour of great need
[1:07:19] something can happen
[1:07:22] because I won't be able to do it myself
[1:07:26] I I have failed so many times and walked
[1:07:30] away embarrassed of myself
[1:07:32] because in the time of great trial I
[1:07:35] failed
[1:07:36] and Times of great pressure I've done
[1:07:38] what Peter's done
[1:07:42] and I have I've been as foolish as Peter
[1:07:45] was to make great boasting statements
[1:07:47] about my Christianity and my love for
[1:07:49] God and
[1:07:50] my belief of the truth
[1:07:53] and in a great time of trouble
[1:07:56] I've done what Peter's done
[1:08:00] but I thank God
[1:08:03] that God got a hold of Peter
[1:08:06] he changed Peter
[1:08:08] humbled Peter and broke Peter and Peter
[1:08:10] got to where Peter no longer trusted
[1:08:12] Peter
[1:08:14] and he died and Christ began to live
[1:08:18] until Peter and so much that when he
[1:08:21] would begin to pray for a lame man a man
[1:08:23] that would go running and leaping and
[1:08:25] jumping and praising God Amen he would
[1:08:27] recognize why why look you to me like I
[1:08:30] healed this man I had no power to heal
[1:08:31] him but in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:33] Christ whom you crucified this man
[1:08:35] stands hold
[1:08:36] Peter had gotten so far away of boasting
[1:08:39] so far away of being proud and arrogant
[1:08:41] and boastful and claiming he can do
[1:08:43] something to when he actually when God
[1:08:45] actually uses him Amen to perform a
[1:08:48] mighty Miracle he won't even take credit
[1:08:50] for it now and say why are you looking
[1:08:51] at me as though in my power I've done
[1:08:53] this
[1:08:57] amen oh that's where we need to be
[1:09:00] friends that's the place in humility and
[1:09:02] sincerity and simplicity amen so that we
[1:09:05] can become nothing so that he has room
[1:09:07] to become everything
[1:09:09] so that we're not asking God Amen to
[1:09:12] divide for position
[1:09:20] so I can die so that he can live
[1:09:24] amen I can surrender and empty out so he
[1:09:26] can fill up
[1:09:28] time of great need may he that's in me
[1:09:33] overcome
[1:09:35] because greater is he that's in me
[1:09:37] than he that's in the world
[1:09:39] greater is he that's in me
[1:09:41] than he that's in the world Council of
[1:09:43] churches
[1:09:44] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:09:45] that's in governments greater is he
[1:09:47] that's in me than he that's in
[1:09:51] that's
[1:09:52] that's where our hope will come from
[1:09:56] prophet of God goes on to tell another
[1:09:58] story about a Madman out in Washington
[1:10:00] he said have you ever read my book at
[1:10:03] the maniac out there in Washington have
[1:10:05] you read that that Maniac onto the
[1:10:08] platform 260 pound man or more and said
[1:10:10] I'll break every bone in your body
[1:10:13] and police and ministers fled every way
[1:10:15] and I was left on the platform with the
[1:10:17] maniac something happened
[1:10:21] it's a different message same statement
[1:10:24] something happened
[1:10:28] remember brother Ben said I'm not the
[1:10:30] one
[1:10:30] who was on the river that day I'm not
[1:10:32] the one who opened bly's eyes and does
[1:10:34] all these Miracles I was just standing
[1:10:35] there when he did that
[1:10:39] amen amen I hope we can have that
[1:10:41] testimony
[1:10:42] that I'm standing near when he does
[1:10:44] something
[1:10:46] I don't want to live a life that never
[1:10:48] sees him come on the scene I don't want
[1:10:49] to live a life that never sees him amen
[1:10:51] come into action I don't want to live a
[1:10:53] life that I can never say something
[1:10:54] happened it wasn't me it was him there
[1:10:56] was a faith that came up there was some
[1:10:58] words that came out there's something
[1:11:00] happen and then a fear Fade Away not
[1:11:02] because I said I'm not going to be
[1:11:03] afraid but because something actually
[1:11:05] happened
[1:11:07] that I can't explain I can't work up
[1:11:10] amen my emotions were moving into fear
[1:11:12] then all of a sudden something else
[1:11:14] moved in and fear was pushed out of the
[1:11:16] way and Faith took its place because
[1:11:17] love grabbed faith and pushed it to the
[1:11:20] Forefront
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:26] he says I waited the time 128 pounds and
[1:11:31] the maniac stood like that as T set
[1:11:33] together he said you snake in the grass
[1:11:36] up here pretending to be a man of God
[1:11:38] I'll show you how much man of God you
[1:11:39] are I'll break every bone in your body
[1:11:41] and he drew back his big fist and he was
[1:11:43] well able physically to carry out his
[1:11:45] threat
[1:11:47] and brother bam says he spit on him
[1:11:51] the man hawked and spit on him
[1:11:55] boy I don't know if you've ever been
[1:11:56] sped on
[1:11:57] would you talk about something
[1:11:59] infuriating a human being
[1:12:02] everything was was pushing would push a
[1:12:05] human's emotion around the wrong way
[1:12:09] but he says something happened
[1:12:13] instead of despising that man I felt
[1:12:16] sorry for him
[1:12:19] I thought poor man you wouldn't treat me
[1:12:21] that way while you were a man just like
[1:12:24] I am you wasn't made to act like that
[1:12:27] you were made to love and to be a father
[1:12:29] of your children and to love them and to
[1:12:31] love all men you were made to be a Son
[1:12:33] of God but the devil has took a hold of
[1:12:35] you I felt sorry for the man
[1:12:38] and he said walked up to me close and
[1:12:40] went
[1:12:41] and he spit in my face I looked at him
[1:12:44] I've had it happen with witch doctors
[1:12:46] and everything don't worry if God is
[1:12:48] with you who can be against you
[1:12:51] this man hawked and spit in his face
[1:12:55] but something happened
[1:12:58] so I looked at the man and I thought
[1:13:00] poor man
[1:13:02] I love you my poor lost brother
[1:13:05] listen that is not a slogan
[1:13:10] that was not that was not a preconceived
[1:13:14] thought when when I get spit on this is
[1:13:16] what I'll say
[1:13:20] in fact you can carry those flash cards
[1:13:22] around in your pocket after this service
[1:13:23] and let's see how well it works amen
[1:13:25] before you get the flash card you'll say
[1:13:27] something else
[1:13:29] laughs
[1:13:32] but it was the reality of the love of
[1:13:35] God
[1:13:38] so I thought poor man I love you my poor
[1:13:40] lost brother I never said a word and he
[1:13:43] walked up to me and he raised his big
[1:13:44] his big fist back and the crowd setting
[1:13:47] breathless of six thousand inside and
[1:13:49] pretty near that many standing in the
[1:13:50] rain he drew back his big fist he just
[1:13:53] struck a preacher he was out of the
[1:13:55] insane institution you might ask the
[1:13:57] police there they was on the records to
[1:13:59] date and he'd hit a minister and broke
[1:14:00] his jaw in his collar boom run in there
[1:14:03] and run to the platform he said this
[1:14:04] night I'm going to break every bone in
[1:14:06] your body and I looked at him not with
[1:14:09] hatred but with love
[1:14:11] and as he did and started towards me
[1:14:13] something inside of me said but tonight
[1:14:15] you'll fall over my feet
[1:14:18] fall over your feet he said I'll show
[1:14:20] you you snake in the grass whose feet
[1:14:22] off all over and he ran to me and threw
[1:14:24] back his big fist to strike me I said
[1:14:26] Satan come out of the man
[1:14:28] and as I said his head went back and he
[1:14:30] fell and pinned my feet to the floor the
[1:14:32] police had to roll him off oh that's it
[1:14:35] love
[1:14:38] when brother Benham something happened
[1:14:40] to him
[1:14:42] and when something happened to him
[1:14:43] instead of being angry with this man or
[1:14:45] angry with the boulder angry with the
[1:14:47] Hornets instead of the natural human
[1:14:49] reaction instead of fear or anger or
[1:14:52] hatred or bitterness amen something else
[1:14:54] took over and when the love of God came
[1:14:56] on the scene it caused him to have
[1:14:58] sympathy for the one who was potentially
[1:15:01] hurting him
[1:15:03] Sympathy for the bull oh I'm sorry I
[1:15:05] Disturbed you it's my fault I shouldn't
[1:15:07] have I'm sorry Hornets I forgot you were
[1:15:09] there you got just as much a right to be
[1:15:11] there oh I felt looked at the man I said
[1:15:13] you poor man you don't want to be like
[1:15:15] that there was a sympathy that came in
[1:15:17] with the love of God and began amen
[1:15:20] began instantly to walk in the other
[1:15:22] person's shoes
[1:15:24] and change the whole perspective and
[1:15:27] begin you don't want to live like this
[1:15:28] you wouldn't really want to hurt me
[1:15:29] something's wrong amen and and begin to
[1:15:33] master and dominate the situation not by
[1:15:36] force not by yelling not by harsh words
[1:15:38] amen not not even having to raise his
[1:15:41] tone of voice
[1:15:44] but began to command the situation by
[1:15:47] love
[1:15:48] and love was the force that abated
[1:15:51] whatever was driving this man
[1:15:54] love conquered
[1:15:57] amen whatever was driving that bull
[1:15:59] loved conquered whatever was driving us
[1:16:01] when it's a love conquered amen whatever
[1:16:04] was driving brother Branham to fear and
[1:16:06] grab a gun love conquered
[1:16:09] love mastered the whole situation
[1:16:13] and gone
[1:16:16] oh I don't think we realized what we
[1:16:19] lost in Eden
[1:16:21] but it's coming back
[1:16:24] I I don't think we even realize how far
[1:16:28] as human beings because we don't know
[1:16:31] what it was
[1:16:33] but oh it's coming back
[1:16:37] it's coming back and the seeds of it are
[1:16:39] here in his people amen the power of it
[1:16:42] resonates in his people and I want that
[1:16:45] to come on the scene not me
[1:16:48] I want to die
[1:16:50] so that he can live
[1:16:52] brother Branham says friends I'm not no
[1:16:54] little boy no more I've seen a mini a
[1:16:56] test
[1:16:57] but I've never seen nothing yet could
[1:16:59] override love
[1:17:01] it just takes everything out of the way
[1:17:03] love conquers wild animals love conquers
[1:17:06] it's just the most conquering Force
[1:17:08] there is because it's God
[1:17:12] you know why I can help you because you
[1:17:15] love me and you believe me if you didn't
[1:17:18] believe me no matter what kind of works
[1:17:19] God would do by me you still wouldn't
[1:17:21] get any benefit do you know that that's
[1:17:24] my success with the Lord
[1:17:25] the people love me and I love them and
[1:17:29] that's where the success comes from
[1:17:32] amen that's the successive Ministry
[1:17:35] I mean if God didn't put in my heart to
[1:17:38] love you and you to love me amen all the
[1:17:41] preaching in the world wouldn't produce
[1:17:42] anything
[1:17:45] Amen brother Brown says that's why I can
[1:17:47] help you is because you got confidence
[1:17:48] in me
[1:17:49] and I can tell I mean I can tell you I
[1:17:52] can take no credit for it amen because
[1:17:54] instantly when God called me to become a
[1:17:57] pastor and I became a pastor God changed
[1:17:59] something inside of me
[1:18:01] something in me come alive amen that
[1:18:03] that wasn't there before and I began to
[1:18:06] love this congregation and love the
[1:18:07] people with a love that's beyond just
[1:18:10] Chad this is not just emotion something
[1:18:12] actually happened in me
[1:18:14] because it has to be that way if I can't
[1:18:17] really love you how in the world can I
[1:18:19] help you amen there's tons of preachers
[1:18:20] lots of words that can be spoken but if
[1:18:23] there's no love being projected with the
[1:18:25] ministry amen it's not effective
[1:18:31] amen just being able to preach is not
[1:18:33] enough
[1:18:35] but there actually has to be God Amen
[1:18:37] God himself has to work through the gift
[1:18:40] and love has to be projected so
[1:18:42] Sovereign Grace can take its place how
[1:18:44] will people get saved amen because love
[1:18:47] must be projected the word must be
[1:18:49] preached with love
[1:18:51] corrected in love admonished with love
[1:18:53] amen taught with love
[1:18:58] and Brethren said that's the secret to
[1:18:59] my success
[1:19:01] because people know I love them when I
[1:19:04] listen to brother random I I feel like
[1:19:06] he loves the people he loved me
[1:19:08] and I loved him amen and it does me a
[1:19:11] world of good
[1:19:12] but if there's not reciprocating love
[1:19:14] amen if that love leaves the church amen
[1:19:17] all the great teaching in the world is
[1:19:19] not going to produce anything amen there
[1:19:21] must be a love a love relationship back
[1:19:24] and forth
[1:19:25] the same thing for the home it doesn't
[1:19:27] matter how much God Godly wisdom Daddy
[1:19:30] has amen if love is broken amen and
[1:19:32] there's no confidence back and forth
[1:19:34] amen there's going to be problems
[1:19:36] but there's got to be a love we need
[1:19:39] more than flesh we need God
[1:19:43] same God Amen who begins to change us
[1:19:47] the natural and listen it's not
[1:19:50] emotional love it's not that I can get
[1:19:52] up here and then start pulling on
[1:19:53] emotion I'm not good at that anyways
[1:19:57] I'm just I'm sorry I'm a failure when it
[1:20:00] comes to working emotions and don't you
[1:20:03] feel and let's all Kumbaya that's not my
[1:20:05] nature
[1:20:06] some people are so good at that they can
[1:20:08] pull people emotionally and connect them
[1:20:10] emotionally to themselves God never gave
[1:20:12] me that ability amen so he had to put a
[1:20:14] real love in my heart for you all and it
[1:20:16] has to be something that you can feel
[1:20:17] you can sense it's got to come through
[1:20:22] it's got to be a reality
[1:20:27] amen that was the secret to a success
[1:20:30] and like I said I can take no credit for
[1:20:32] it it's something God did inside of me
[1:20:34] and I'm thankful he did because I'd be
[1:20:37] ineffective without it but it's not
[1:20:39] something that I could produce
[1:20:41] and it's not something that says I ought
[1:20:44] to love my brother in the church that's
[1:20:46] not going to get it
[1:20:47] I ought to a Shepherd ought to love the
[1:20:50] Sheep so I ought to love that's not
[1:20:52] going to get it
[1:20:53] she'd say I ought to love my shepherd
[1:20:54] that's not going to get it I ought to
[1:20:56] love my brother I ought to love that's
[1:20:58] not going to cut it it's going to take
[1:20:59] something more than that
[1:21:01] it's going to take God actually knitting
[1:21:03] our hearts together in love God actually
[1:21:05] giving us love for a brother love for a
[1:21:07] sister love for one another
[1:21:09] it's got to be real
[1:21:11] but thank God
[1:21:13] brother Mary said why would you want to
[1:21:15] substitute when the skies are full of
[1:21:16] the room
[1:21:18] this is what he's wanting to do Jesus
[1:21:20] says all men shall know you're my
[1:21:22] disciples when
[1:21:24] you have a loved one for another
[1:21:27] he didn't say when you do the signs when
[1:21:29] you do the Wonders I mean they will come
[1:21:30] with it but they have to be motivated by
[1:21:32] love but all men will know you're my
[1:21:34] disciples when you have love one for
[1:21:36] another
[1:21:38] but the man had something in him
[1:21:42] something in him that would rise to the
[1:21:45] occasion when the need was there
[1:21:47] when when there's no more human love
[1:21:50] when human love's not enough and
[1:21:52] remember brother Branham was a Golden
[1:21:54] Glove boxer
[1:21:59] if the love of God had not come on the
[1:22:02] scene
[1:22:03] who knows what would have happened
[1:22:05] with the maniac
[1:22:07] but there was another Force
[1:22:10] that was faster than his hands
[1:22:15] took control of the situation
[1:22:19] amen I believe there's another force in
[1:22:21] me
[1:22:22] not because of me but because of God
[1:22:25] amen I believe there's something else in
[1:22:27] me
[1:22:28] that can Master every situation
[1:22:31] but oh God help me to get myself out of
[1:22:34] the way and let you master every
[1:22:36] situation
[1:22:38] help me in times Amen in times of of
[1:22:41] stress and fear help me to just pause
[1:22:43] long enough to say Lord I don't want
[1:22:45] this amen I'm surrendering and yielding
[1:22:48] you take over Lord because I don't have
[1:22:50] this
[1:22:51] I don't have it I don't have enough for
[1:22:54] this world
[1:22:55] I don't have enough emotional Reserve I
[1:22:57] don't have enough strength I don't have
[1:22:59] enough with I don't have enough to meet
[1:23:01] the challenge of the hour me as a human
[1:23:03] being I don't have what it takes to meet
[1:23:05] the challenge of the hour
[1:23:07] but I believe by the gift of God Amen
[1:23:10] and I believe by the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost that I've got within me more than
[1:23:15] enough to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:23:18] and I want the outer man to stay out of
[1:23:20] the way so that God on the inside can do
[1:23:23] abundantly above all that we could ask
[1:23:25] or think by the power that dwells within
[1:23:27] us
[1:23:30] let's say God help us
[1:23:32] let's turn to first Thessalonians
[1:23:34] chapter 3.
[1:23:45] first Thessalonians chapter 3.
[1:23:48] verse 12.
[1:23:57] and the Lord Make You to increase
[1:24:01] and abound in love one to another and
[1:24:04] toward all men even as we do towards you
[1:24:07] to the end he may establish your hearts
[1:24:10] unblameable and Holiness before God even
[1:24:13] our father at the coming of our Lord
[1:24:15] Jesus Christ with all his Saints
[1:24:19] look at verse 12 again and the Lord Make
[1:24:22] You
[1:24:23] to increase and abound in love
[1:24:26] I say Lord Make Me
[1:24:29] make me to a crease and abound in love
[1:24:32] oh if it's in the word it's possible
[1:24:35] if it's in the word it's for me if it's
[1:24:37] part of the word it's for me and if and
[1:24:39] if Paul was praying that the Lord Make
[1:24:41] You abound in love and then it's
[1:24:43] possible that the Lord will make me
[1:24:45] abound in love and I'm saying Lord Make
[1:24:47] Me abound in love make me grow in love
[1:24:49] and walk in love and increase in love
[1:24:52] Let It Be In Me Lord
[1:24:54] for it's a possibility because it's in
[1:24:56] your word
[1:24:57] brother Branham tells us a story I just
[1:25:00] like to finish with this he tells us
[1:25:02] about an experience he had when he went
[1:25:03] beyond the curtain of time
[1:25:05] and he began to see the saints that it
[1:25:07] went on and he was hugging them and
[1:25:08] shaking their hand and they were calling
[1:25:10] him his precious brother
[1:25:12] he said if you could just only remain if
[1:25:15] I could just only remain there forever
[1:25:17] it is no yesterday no tomorrow you're
[1:25:19] just there no sin nothing can happen
[1:25:22] sinfully there's nothing could be sin
[1:25:24] and everything was perfect love
[1:25:27] what was there perfect love
[1:25:31] and he makes this statement
[1:25:33] he says just remember I'll say this with
[1:25:36] the faith that I have in that Vision
[1:25:38] whatever it was I'll speak it in the
[1:25:40] name of the Lord
[1:25:41] except you have that perfect love you'll
[1:25:44] never be there
[1:25:48] Works aren't going to produce it
[1:25:50] efforts Christian labels
[1:25:55] it's not going to work
[1:25:57] only perfect love
[1:25:59] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost
[1:26:03] except you have that perfect love you'll
[1:26:05] never be there because nothing could
[1:26:07] ever be there without it
[1:26:09] your spirit would be out of place there
[1:26:11] it couldn't come there would be no way
[1:26:14] for it to come
[1:26:17] I want to go there
[1:26:19] but I've got something in me now by the
[1:26:22] grace of God that'll carry me there
[1:26:25] and I believe I've got something in me
[1:26:26] now amen that will take its place and
[1:26:30] every obstacle I find
[1:26:33] and that's why we we've been given such
[1:26:36] a word in our day we've been given such
[1:26:38] a measure of the word because with the
[1:26:40] measure of the word comes the fullness
[1:26:42] of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] and the full power of God and the full
[1:26:46] manifestation of Christ has been made
[1:26:48] available in this generation and I want
[1:26:51] to stay surrendered to all of it and uh
[1:26:53] and listen I don't want to get
[1:26:54] distracted away amen from what my
[1:26:57] purpose is here with all the things that
[1:26:59] life can distract us away from but I
[1:27:01] want to stay consecrated I want to stay
[1:27:03] simple dedicated sincere so that there's
[1:27:06] a greater portion of God taking control
[1:27:08] of me and less of me taking control
[1:27:13] so that in every situation
[1:27:15] he can come on the scene
[1:27:17] let's finish with the Ephesians I want
[1:27:19] to read one more scripture in Ephesians
[1:27:21] chapter 5.
[1:27:25] Ephesians chapters 5 verse 1.
[1:27:30] it says be therefore followers of God as
[1:27:34] dear children
[1:27:35] and walk in love as Christ also have
[1:27:38] loved us and has given himself for us an
[1:27:41] offering and sacrifice to God
[1:27:43] for a sweet smelling savior
[1:27:46] Paul admonishes the church he says Walk
[1:27:49] In Love
[1:27:50] so there is a walk in love that we can
[1:27:53] walk in
[1:27:54] he wouldn't have he wouldn't have
[1:27:56] commanded the church to walk in love if
[1:27:58] he weren't possible to walk in love
[1:28:00] but in order to walk in love we we have
[1:28:03] to stop walking in things that aren't
[1:28:05] love
[1:28:07] because we're walking in this life we're
[1:28:08] walking in this earth and so much of our
[1:28:11] walk amen can be consumed with things
[1:28:13] that aren't love
[1:28:15] can be consumed with things that are not
[1:28:17] Eternal that are not gone amen but he
[1:28:19] told the church Walk In Love Don't Walk
[1:28:21] in the world don't walk in worldly
[1:28:22] desires and walk in the flesh and the
[1:28:25] desires of the flesh but he said Walk In
[1:28:27] Love
[1:28:28] and God is love and the things that are
[1:28:30] of God and God is the word and the word
[1:28:31] has been given to us amen and the Holy
[1:28:33] Ghost is love and God is love amen so
[1:28:36] what do we walk and we walk in love
[1:28:37] let's walk in this message that he's
[1:28:39] given us and walk in the light of the
[1:28:41] hour and walk in God and God Walk in us
[1:28:43] and let us walk in love as Paul told the
[1:28:46] church Walk In Love
[1:28:48] say God help me to walk in your love
[1:28:52] help me to walk away from the other
[1:28:54] things amen and walk in love so that it
[1:28:57] will produce in Me Love
[1:29:00] let me pay attention to love
[1:29:03] so that in Me Love Grows let me
[1:29:06] surrender to love so that Love Takes
[1:29:08] control let me yield to love so that
[1:29:10] love begins to become the dominant force
[1:29:12] in my life help me God to walk in love
[1:29:16] make me to walk in love
[1:29:19] amen let's all stand musicians if you'll
[1:29:22] come
[1:29:23] praise be to God
[1:29:26] I love the message of the hour
[1:29:30] I love the word of God I love the
[1:29:32] example that God's given to us
[1:29:35] friends there's
[1:29:36] so little
[1:29:38] that we can do
[1:29:40] humanly speaking I'm not talking about
[1:29:42] as children of God I'm not talking about
[1:29:44] the seed of God what I'm talking about
[1:29:46] as a human being there's so little that
[1:29:48] you can do
[1:29:49] you can't save yourself you can't save
[1:29:51] your children you can't protect your
[1:29:53] home you can't protect your property you
[1:29:55] can't do anything
[1:29:58] but the power of God is unlimited
[1:30:02] and it operates by the love of God
[1:30:06] and if I know that that the the greatest
[1:30:08] force on Earth is love and I know that
[1:30:11] God is love and I know that God is his
[1:30:13] word and I've been commissioned and I've
[1:30:15] been challenged to walk in love amen
[1:30:18] then I know that if I continue to stay
[1:30:20] in his love and stay in this channel
[1:30:22] that he is open for us that love inside
[1:30:25] of me will grow and take more dominion
[1:30:27] and Love Will Conquer everything
[1:30:30] I don't have to be good enough I don't
[1:30:33] have to be powerful enough I don't have
[1:30:34] to have enough I just need more of him
[1:30:37] in me because he's enough
[1:30:40] I need to walk in this love
[1:30:42] and God help us to surrender amen let's
[1:30:45] bow our heads together ask the Lord to
[1:30:48] help us walk in his love
[1:30:50] their Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[1:30:52] for your goodness
[1:30:53] for your grace Lord for the word that
[1:30:55] you've given to us in this hour
[1:30:58] God it's your great love gift to your
[1:31:00] bride is the love gift of yourself
[1:31:04] when through this message you unveiled
[1:31:06] Yourself by the opening of the word you
[1:31:08] gave yourself to us
[1:31:11] and God we want to just open up and
[1:31:13] receive you Lord
[1:31:15] God you're a gentleman
[1:31:17] you don't come where you're not invited
[1:31:19] you don't take what's not given
[1:31:21] for you're a great gentleman
[1:31:24] and God your Prophet taught us in doors
[1:31:27] and doors if you're invited onto the
[1:31:30] living room you'll come
[1:31:32] but if you're told not to go into the
[1:31:35] bedroom not to go into the kitchen
[1:31:36] you'll not
[1:31:38] because you come where you're invited
[1:31:40] but God help us now to surrender in a
[1:31:43] greater way and invite you to take full
[1:31:45] possession of your house
[1:31:47] not to just invite you to the front door
[1:31:49] but invite you through every door
[1:31:52] so that you can come and take possession
[1:31:55] of The Possession you've redeemed
[1:31:57] and may you live through US Lord
[1:32:00] that as we meet these trying times
[1:32:02] whether it be through sickness
[1:32:05] better be through heartache
[1:32:07] fear troubles whatever we might find
[1:32:12] I prayed God that we would learn to rest
[1:32:14] and allow you to take your place
[1:32:16] and God in every one of these situations
[1:32:18] we're praying that something will happen
[1:32:21] something Beyond us something beyond our
[1:32:24] ability something will happen
[1:32:26] and you'll begin to project Your Love
[1:32:29] and love will begin to take over lord
[1:32:31] and move from within us to take over and
[1:32:34] master the situation
[1:32:36] and bring everything according to your
[1:32:38] Sovereign plan
[1:32:40] all we yield ourselves to you help us
[1:32:42] God
[1:32:43] reveal to us anything that's a stumbling
[1:32:46] Stone before our feet anything we've
[1:32:48] allowed that we shouldn't have anything
[1:32:49] that we are permitting that you want us
[1:32:52] to remove God help us to surrender to it
[1:32:54] now and yield
[1:32:56] may you come and take your place Lord
[1:32:59] God put a greater love in our hearts
[1:33:01] help us make us to walk in love help us
[1:33:04] to walk in your love and may your love
[1:33:06] increase in US

[1:33:13] all that you would help us in our time
[1:33:15] of need
[1:33:16] for God Only You
[1:33:18] will bring us through
[1:33:20] and only your perfect love will take us
[1:33:23] to that perfect place

[1:33:30] greater measure than ever before as we
[1:33:33] yield and empty hour we love you father

[1:33:37] As We Go From Here Lord May the word
[1:33:40] that was preached take effect in our
[1:33:42] lives
[1:33:42] May the word be a force a power that
[1:33:45] begins Lord as we receive it by faith
[1:33:48] may it begin to do the work that we
[1:33:50] cannot do in our own willpower but we
[1:33:52] surrender our will to you and we
[1:33:54] surrender our rights to your word and
[1:33:56] may you come in and begin to do the work
[1:33:58] that we cannot do
