[0:00] there was a message that was given to
[0:02] Noah there was instruction that was
[0:05] given to Noah
[0:07] he followed the instruction
[0:09] but within the instruction was a
[0:12] representation of a precept
[0:16] there was something that was being
[0:18] represented by what Noah was doing that
[0:20] was bigger even that what Noah was doing
[0:24] God committed a precept that when
[0:26] judgment is about to come that he will
[0:28] give away of escape and here it is being
[0:31] played out in this dramatic scene Noah
[0:33] is building an ark
[0:37] in the instruction
[0:39] was a precept
[0:42] and there are times where we look at
[0:44] instruction that has been given and we
[0:48] confuse the instruction with the precept
[0:53] we hear the instruction
[0:55] we we want to be obedient but in the
[0:58] instruction we miss the precinct
[1:01] so we are following this instruction
[1:04] and this instruction and this
[1:06] instruction and this instruction
[1:09] and Our Lives begin to produce
[1:13] strife
[1:15] but God never produces strife
[1:18] not with his children not not amongst
[1:20] his children and not within his children
[1:22] God is the author of Peace God is
[1:25] presenting peace he's giving us a
[1:26] message of peace and when he gives us a
[1:28] message a message of Peace it produces
[1:30] peace
[1:33] but I'm following the instruction
[1:36] I'm trying to do what God told me to do
[1:39] but friends there are times when we are
[1:41] looking at the instruction
[1:44] and we miss the precept
[1:46] this is why Jesus said I come not to
[1:50] destroy the law but to fulfill the law
[1:54] the precepts are written in the law of
[1:57] Moses but if you try to only follow the
[1:59] law it produces death
[2:03] friends it's so close it seems that I
[2:06] have a genuine desire I desire to do
[2:08] what is right and I'm following the
[2:11] instructions of God but we miss the
[2:13] precepts we miss God's intention
[2:19] and in doing so
[2:21] we misapply
[2:23] we misunderstand
[2:26] the precepts
[2:28] it is not just line upon line
[2:31] it is precept
[2:33] upon Precinct
