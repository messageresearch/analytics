creator and the big sister and he spoke the heavenly [Music] and with one mighty swoop of his hand he threw out the stars [Music] if you think you're just drifting along then i have good news and if he on the moon i know he will help you [Music] he'll hold you too how much more he loves [Music] [Music] now if you feel like the world lays hard on your shoulder and even closest friend in life is pulling away though you have tried so there is still hope look to the cross there you will see just how much the savior really loves you today [Music] and if he on the moon [Music] how much more he loves you [Music] in the beginning of time you were on his mind when he owned the moon how much more he loves you the beginning of time you were on his mind in the beginning of time you were on his mind when he hung the moon thank you jesus [Applause] oh lord to your days i sing praises to your name oh lord praises to your name i is praises hallelujah praise the lord he's worthy of our praise amen god bless you while we're standing let's open our bible to galatians chapter 3. we'll begin there i pray the lord will have his way amen it's certainly good to be together the deacons did some fast counting and they come back and told me that all the brothers have been confirmed so we thank god for that and god bless you for taking the time to do that to confirm that i also want to say i appreciate and thank god that we have brothers who can take a position that live a clean life and serve god you know there's there's churches that have trouble finding brothers to fill offices but by the grace of god to see that there's so many brothers and so many more than just the brothers that are holding an office brothers who live a godly life lead their families take their place in the body it's encouraging friends it's encouraging if you look across the landscape of america in general and even europe uh not i'm not talking this message church i'm just talking in general the men are gone they've left churches they're gone amen and that's never the way it was supposed to be the men were supposed to lead in worship supposed to lead their homes amen but i thank god that there's a word that is calling men forth amen i appreciate that it's a bold word it's a challenging word and it's challenging to the men of the age but god has got men of the age who will rise to the challenge so we thank god for that let's read galatians chapter 3 and verse 16. now to abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ that's a big verse we're going to pray and then we'll ask god to open it to us dear lord jesus we thank you for this word lord it means so much to us the hour that we live in lord it's the only firm foundation that we have lord is your word and your spirit here to make it live and lord we just ask now that you would minister your word we've come to feed from your hand lord and we pray that you would just deliver your word unto us speak to us lord and the truth lord take preeminence among us and drop it into our heart and let every word bring forth life and great manifestation and an abundance let this word bring forth a tremendous harvest in this hour we ask it lord for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated i just want to read this again before we go to our next scripture now to abraham and his seed where the promise is made so there's a promise to abraham and his seed which brother banham comes and tells us is the faith seed of abraham or the royal seed not the natural seed because abraham was told to look at the sands of the sands of the by the side of the sea and try to count them for so shall the number of a seed be but then he was told to look at the stars of heaven showing that there's going to be a natural seed but there's also going to be a royal seed or a heavenly seed or a faith seed amen and how many of you can say you're part of the faith seed of abraham well praise god because it the promise was given to abraham and his seed where the promise is made that makes you part of the promise the the covenant to abraham that thy seed shall possess the gates of your enemy that means you shall possess the gates of your enemy so the question is what is your enemy right now the promise is you'll possess the gates of that enemy whatever trouble whatever enemies come against you whatever demon power is trying to afflict your body afflict your family afflict whatever amen the promise is you you shall overtake the enemy the enemy shall not overtake you you shall possess the gates of your enemy and if this is the promise to the abraham and to his seed where the promise is made he saith not and deceits as of many ceases of many but as of one into thy seed which is christ so brother of them tells us it's a royal seed it's the faith seed and we believe we're part of that seed so that means that seed is christ and if you're part of that seed you're part of christ it's one lineage through the bible it's not different families with different family names it doesn't matter what last name is on your birth certificate amen when god amen projected out his word amen that word coming into manifestation is christ in whatever age in whatever form it comes into manifestation it's christ and that's the seed amen it's the seed of the word coming into manifestation in this day so we can see that we're part of that seed which is christ now let's go back to genesis chapter one i have a lot that i want to go through today by the grace of god if you'll just help us amen a lot of quotes i'd like to read so you bear with me and you pull on the quotes too amen amen because they're good and i've got a lot to read maybe we may not i don't know but we'll just see how the lord leads but there's a lot of things in my heart that i'd like to share in this hour genesis 1 and verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light so we know in this condition the message tells us brother van tells us that earth is in a in a judged condition it's under judgment amen there was a previous civilization there was something that happened before amen in between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 the earth has been destroyed and under the judgment of god amen and now under the judgment of god there's there's the earth is without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep so it's shrouded in darkness and and no one's able to tell what form the earth is in it's in darkness it's hidden it's in a mystery form all right and the mystery is in the darkness the darkness is hiding the form amen in a mystery but god is going to begin to break the mystery and as he breaks the mystery he's going to bring up the form of the earth or or or the or the create recreation of the earth amen in this new form but to do that he says in the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and i want to talk about the move of the spirit amen because it's the first time that we find this terminology used in the bible right out of the gate and if we want to understand something a concept in god we need to find what god means by this term not what man has taken it to mean not what the pentecostal denomination has taken it to mean but when we say move the spirit what does god mean when he says move the spirit and what is the move of the spirit supposed to accomplish [Applause] and right here we find out that in judgment and in darkness with no form and the earth in a mystery amen something's got to come and begin to brood over the earth to break the mystery and bring the life that's there from a previous civilization there's something there that has to come forth so the moving of the spirit is going to begin to take the word of god and begin to move it into place to bring back what was in god's mind from before the foundation of the world he says in the rising of the sun now the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live he says in god's power to transform and i think this morning in genesis 1 this world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed think about that what is it it's the move of the spirit it changed the entire picture the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of eden that is transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it god's transforming power in the message conference he says and see when god made man he began to brood over the earth and upcoming little easter flowers up come grass up come species rising higher and higher the great holy spirit brooding or brooding means to be mothering cooing coo coo the flowers come up the father said that's wonderful listen this is the move of the spirit the spirit moved upon the face of the waters what's it doing amen the word of god is coming and the spirit is there to bring the word of god into manifestation so the spirit of god begins to coo over the earth and bring to pass everything god's saying and cooing like a mother cooing bringing up first little flowers and then bringing up this and then bringing up that praise be to god the flowers come up the father said that's wonderful just keep it up and he brooded and after wow out come birds and the next thing outcome animals he kept getting greater greater greater and finally the earth reflecting the reflection of him that was brooding it was brooding god and he was in the image of god so the brooding what was the brooding to take place the the there was a judgment upon the earth but down in there was seeds that god had planted and he wanted to bring forth what was in his mind amen he wanted to break the mystery of the darkness and unfold amen through six days through the breaking of the seals he wanted to unfold the mystery that was in his mind and to do that he sent the agent of the holy ghost down to coo like a mother amen and god would speak and the holy ghost would crew and up would come flowers and up would come mountains and up would come this and everything would get into place to display what was it doing it was breeding from judgment to a garden of eden because that's what god wanted and that's what the move of the spirit did is he took that word of god amen in a judgment condition and began to place the word and coo over creation and bring it in line with the word until it moved from chaos to eden and we've been born in this world under chaos under judgments because of the wrong birth because of what took place in the garden of eden but the spirit of god has moved on our lives and moved through generation after generation and moved through seven church ages what was it trying to do bring up another part of the creation another part of the creation another part of the word amen and building it higher and higher until it began to look more like what was brooding over it through seven church days until you get to the top and come to the capstone until finally it reflects the thing that's been brooding over for seven church ages breaking the mysteries breaking the mysteries why because it was shrouded in darkness to bring it back to reflect something that was in his image see that's what the moving of the spirit was to do to bring it from chaos to eden let's go to genesis chapter 1 verse 26. now i want to read the last part the last part of that quote from conference and then finally the earth reflected the reflection of him that was brooding god and he was in the image of god finally something in the earth what what was coming up things from the earth flowers trees was coming up coming up and he was making it in a higher form and a higher form and a higher form all the well till finally the part of the earth that came up because adam was made out of the earth he was eventually put in the flesh body and finally what came out of the earth was something that reflected him it says in genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them so when he brought something up that was in his own image first it was a spirit man and then the spirit man was male and female and then he took the spirit man and he brought up part of the earth and he put the spirit man in the in the earth but adam and a body of flesh so that he could interact with creation and in him was still male and female why what he was doing he was bringing up something that was in the reflection of god and so now we have to understand to properly understand the reflection of god you had to realize that in this reflection was male and female and it was a proper reflection of god amen because god has attributes of male and female and if we don't understand god and the attributes of male and female or the expression of male and female then we're going to miss amen what god's trying to get us to understand in this day we only see god as as over there amen the god the male part but if we miss that there's a female expression and a female part a man that's been in god all along amen that god wants to express just as much through the male part as he does through the female part if we miss that we've missed the message in our day and the holy ghost was brooding the move of the spirit the spirit began to move amen and bring it all to pass till it finally come up and reflected something that was cooing it that was brooding over it and we know now that man was created in his image and the image of god created to him male and female created he them brother man says and the seed shall not be heir with the shock he was god the logos the word that went out of god when he began to brood upon the earth and brought forth marine life then the spirit of god the logos the word which god said let there be and there went the logos which is the word and the word began because all this was in the logos the whole word of god the whole bible for every age and as the logos begin to breathe upon the earth there came marine life and building up and bird life and on up the animal life and finally there comes something in representation or looked like the thing that was brooding over it god a man in the very image of god male and female the man fell like the seed has to fall and then god began to brood over that after the fall he brought up an enoch he brought up an elijah he brought up a do you understand amen this is the move of the spirit through the old testament what is the spirit doing he's bringing up an enoch he's bringing up an elijah amen he's bringing up what's he bringing up he's bringing up moses he brought up prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the earth came the genuine image of god himself again which was god the logos made flesh and dwelt among us and in him was male and female now that same logos has a part he has got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation what's it trying to do it's trying the spirit of god is trying to do what it did originally back in genesis one it has been doing through the whole bible amen until finally it brought up from the fall through the old testament till it finally got back a man that was reflecting god perfectly and jesus christ was the perfect reflection of god and in him was male and female amen but to complete the work he's got to pull out the female part amen and finish that construction and unite the two back together and what the prophet said was the crowning act of all creation what's the spirit of god been doing down through the bible as the pillar of fire has been moving through the bible we see it show up here and show up there and show up there what's it been trying to do it's been trying to complete the masterpiece the masterpiece that was in god's mind from before the foundation of the world the masterpiece family not just one image but the two being one is the masterpiece he says in god's power to transform now when the world lay in that kind of fix god's spirit moved again upon a seed that was predestinated he translated and transformed isaiah 9 6 of its promise he god was made in human flesh to save that chaos time when man was made in the image of god here come god by the prophet for seeing it the same prophet isaiah 9 6 said unto us a child is born to us a son is given and his name shall be called counselor the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father and of his reign there will be no end and that word is god's word and the spirit moved upon that word and it formed in the womb of a virgin a man a son is born so as we follow down through we pick up this this movement of the spirit but now the spirit was going to take what was laying in a prophecy of isaiah 9 6 and it was going to bring it into manifestation in the in the womb of a virgin and this was god moving his spirit moving the move of god is not about a fleshly sensation but the move of god is about god moving his word into manifestation when god's spirit moves he's moving upon the word to move the word into a manifestation for the hour and every time in the bible and the way brother branham explains it that move was not to make people excited that move was to further his kingdom work and in furthering his kingdom work sometimes the people got excited that was wonderful amen it should be exciting to see the kingdom move and to know the spirit of god's moving that should be a thrill to your soul but the purpose was not to be a thrill to the individual but the purpose was to move god's plan into manifestation and if the move of the spirit does something other than that it wasn't a genuine move of the spirit because it didn't come to excite the flesh it came to move the word of god into place and if that's exciting then that's the side effect or side benefit and we like the side effect and we enjoy the side benefit but the main purpose was to move god's move god's program forward hallelujah let's go to matthew chapter 4. matthew chapter 4 verse 1 then was jesus led up of the spirit unto the wilderness to be tempted of the devil now here the spirit is moving him again but he's moving him to the wilderness to be tempted of the devil now this was not one of those real exciting times i mean i'm sure it was exciting but it wasn't it wasn't one of those stimulating times that felt so nice amen amen it wasn't the one that that that gave him tingly sensations but it was the spirit of god moving this word and manifestation into a further manifestation because it had to be tested it had to fulfill all the word it had to be able to endure the test so the spirit of god moved on him and moved him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil because the lamb had to be tested had to be tried because there couldn't be one spot one blemish he had to stand the test that that he fell by he had to pass the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life so the spirit of god moved him into a position to what to prove the word sometimes the move of the spirit amen from us does not feel good but the move of the spirit is god moving us into a position to prove his word to vindicate that this is my child this is the word and they can endure the testing so not every time the spirit moves upon us and moves us into position not every time is it a thrill not every time is it is it exciting well not every time does it feel like a blessing amen sometimes it's frightening sometimes it's troublesome sometimes it agony it's agony in the flesh but it's still god moving his word along sometimes we won't understand that this is god and if we think god only moves in a way to to bring a blessing or to thrill us or make things exciting sometimes the spirit of god is moving moving us into a trial moving us into temptation to prove the word a testing time and we'll call it the work of the devil when it's a move of the spirits we've got to be mature believers in this hour not immature and be fighting the air but realize that god's in control there's something he wants to do in this hour friends and listen when it was time for that to that baby to be born amen it had jesus had to come forth in bethlehem because of the prophecy and god changed the entire system of the world amen and did something that hadn't been done before amen and created chaos and confusion and absolutely wrecked people's personal lives so that he could get mary and joseph in bethlehem for the word to be fulfilled god will wreck kingdoms to move forward his word and it's a move of the spirit god will wreck individual lives god will break things to pieces and shatter our own dreams and our own ideas and it'll be the move of the spirit getting his word into position to move according to the prophecy you realize mary and joseph would have never taken that journey that when they took that journey at that time on their own god had to change the whole world structure to get the word in position and who was it that moved caesar who was it that moved caesar i don't care what evil spirit god sent forth to do it or allowed to do it it was god amen it was god because god had to bring his word to pass amen in the spirit of god moved to situations so it would match the scriptures praise be to god that may not have you rolling on the floor but at the end of this journey it'll have you saying thank you lord thank you god that there was a power moving me thank you god there was something beyond my intellect something beyond my emotions something beyond my feelings that you had a power greater than my human effort that would move me into position god because there's word to be manifest there's word to be fulfilled and it's going to take the anointing of god to bring it to pass so god knows how to move over the chaos bethlehem was in chaos the day mary and joseph showed up no room in the inn people traveling i'm sure there was a lot of uprising anger confusion fear and what was it god just bringing his word to pass in the midst of chaos what was it god bringing his word to pass what do you think this chaos is all about god bringing his word to pass don't fear when everything goes topsy turning don't be afraid god has not he's not fallen off the throne he's not bumped his head and forgot where his seed is he hasn't forgot what his plan is everything's working according to his plan god's moving his god's moving amen his plan into place he's moving his seat into place to bring he's imparting the waters he's getting everything out of the way he's moving he's moving things around to bring forth amen something that will perfectly reflect his image amen that's what he does so he's done through the church ages that's what he does in our personal lives personally for you to get in the seat you're in now believing what you believe as a child of god god had to bring you through all kinds of circumstances and they weren't all wonderful amen you weren't jumping up and down shouting hallelujah every time the spirit of god moved you sometimes he moved you by losing a job sometimes he moved you amen by rejection of people you love and things that were confusing and difficult but what was it it was the spirit of god moving the chaos moving circumstances around brooding over us because he's trying to take us from the judgment we were born in in chaos and part the waters strike the light the the seed with the light bring it up and cool over it to bring it into full manifestation of the thought he had before the foundation of the world and it's not always been comfortable when the spirit of god moved upon you and it wasn't always a thrill to the soul and it didn't always make you shout and jump up and down sometimes it made you weep sometimes it broke you sometimes it brought you to your knees in agonizing prayer all night long but what was it it was god moving his word forward it was the holy ghost cooing over the seed in you bringing it into further manifestation if we only call the good things god we're going to miss what he's doing in our lives god used terrible circumstances to move forward his word he always has listen god's power to transform but one day the smear the spirit moved upon him again oh listen to this quote friends the spirit moved upon who jesus christ then he probably started running around the room because when the spirit moves you run around the room you can it may happen one day the spirit moved upon him again because there was some word had been written about him come from god through the prophet and he was led to slaughter like a lamb and the spirit moved upon him and led him and sent him to calvary's cross god would do that yes the move of the spirit would do that absolutely and remember when the spirit of god moved upon him this was a move of the spirit moved upon him because there was word that he had to fulfill and part of that word that he had to fulfill was he was a lamb led to the slaughter and so when the spirit of god began to move upon him amen he went into gethsemane and began to weep and to agonize in such agony that he sweated as it were great drops of blood you realize what was that it was the move of the spirit upon him and it caused an agony within because as a human being he didn't want to go through the torture he is a human he didn't want to suffer he didn't want to leave the love and affection of his disciples so it created in him turmoil agony stress anguish of soul what was it it was a move of the spirit until finally he could surrender all of the flesh all of the emotion all of the thoughts all of the desires until he could die and die and die until he can say not my will but thy will be done what was the holy ghost doing cooing over him trying to bring what was down inside to the surface to cut through the human part then to cut through the emotion to cut through the fear and get all the way down into the soul and say that's where the word is and the spirit was brooding trying to bring it up and eventually it popped up and said not my will but thy will be done oh hallelujah friends you realize how many things have lingered from a previous dispensation from a previous denominational view have carried over amen we shouldn't carry those things over but let's take what the prophet said about this and when we begin to look especially at the last year of his ministry he becomes very specific about these things and lets us know the spirit moved him sent him to calvary's cross there he died and everything that was spoken of him in his death was fulfilled to bring light and life to all the predestinated seed of god that was upon the earth he brought the way to do it here is the seed the spirit brings the life here is the seed the spirit brings the life transforming sons and daughters of god from the world in its dark chaos in to be sons and daughters of god brother bram says in spoken word is the original seed now jesus is the word made manifest he in the word is one and the same and that's why it was so made manifest in him so perfectly that's the reason that god manifested himself so perfectly in jesus because he was the seed word the germ word itself the germ that's inside the seed i want you to hold on to that statement because we're going to bring it right home to ourselves in a little bit the germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed so the germ that's inside the seed that's the life that's in the seed you got it you get it he was the germ word of god the germ is the spirit the germ is the water and jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life to water other seed that was coming so the spirit had to come forth to water other seed that was coming do you see even he said other sheep that's not even of this fold i have they're going to see that they're going to get that word and stay right with it i'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it'll produce just exactly it'll produce miracles it'll produce power of god it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed with the seed it's a kindred it won't deny when the spirit amen when when the germ of life that was in that seed amen that's the spirit or that's the water that breaks forth the water the other seed it will not deny it because it's a kindred to that seed it's the same seed line it's of the same family it's of the same thing so it won't deny it when it comes forth brother bam says in in the message paradox 1964 now what is it christ coming to his body christ is the word we all know the anointing is christ that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right that is the anointing christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in divine healing whatever more see and christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife to become one so brother ma'am is typing this again with male and female he said christ is the anointing this the spirit that comes upon the word the word is in your heart and christ the anointing coming to his body so christ is the anointing amen or the spirit of god brooding over the seed that's in your heart to bring it into manifestation and they're the same seed they're of the same product they come from the same source so this one won't refuse the brooding of this one it won't refuse the word that's coming and the life that's coming and the brooding of the spirit won't be refused because whatever amen whatever produced this seed and it broke forth and the life of that seed is coming back on this seed there's something in that seed that matches this thing that's brooding over it and it won't deny it it's like husband and wife to become one brother baby says it is the rising of the sun now there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman and spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material and notice when he made eve from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for adam was spoken word what's that make the bride spoken word he took from him and then taken away from adam and placed it in eve i'm sorry he took from him and then taken he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eve so it's still part of adam's spirit it's adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamic that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh we'll get to it in a minute see how's it done how that is the great that what is the great transformation notice now if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you quicken not not just quicken in translation but quicken now this body that love to smoke love to drink love to look at evil hear evil amen all of those things amen the spirit of god dwelling in you brooding over you bringing the life that's in the seed in the soul in the manifestation amen quickens this mortal body amen to actually actually display the life that's down inside of the seed so it doesn't love amen that you love used to love to look at evil things you don't love to look at evil things anymore you used to love to hear evil things don't love to hear evil things anymore you used to love the taste of cigarettes the taste of alcohol and now you don't love it anymore what is it the same spirit that quickened him is quickening your mortal body it's quickening it now amen quickening it more and more and more and bringing it into a manifestation of the life on the inside that's been quickened by the brooding of the spirit of god doing what taking your chaos and drawing it up flowers and trees and mouth and drawing it what drawing it to something that will perfectly reflect the one that's brooding over it praise be to god oh my the predestinated one of course like the seed laid upon the earth and the one that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seed oh this is good if you believe you're one of them how many say i'm one of them this is this is going to make us happy friends he just said if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh my the predestinated one of course not everybody the predestination of course liked the seed that upon the earth the one that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seed the waters and things burnt them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god knowed it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own now this is deep now and be sure to catch this good now as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring part of the dirt which was enclosed around the life it was to bring part of the dirt and close the round of life we're to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone how the same spirit that raising from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal body to live his kind of life to manifest the manifestations he manifested to do the works that he did to obey like he obeyed to live like he lived what was it the same spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling you it'll quicken your mortal body what did the sun come to do when the sun came to shine amen it didn't come amen to bring all the dirt to life amen but only that dirt that was encompassed around a life inside of a seed that quickened that to life and when it quickened that to life it took that dirt around it and brought it up into the manifestation of the life that was on the inside it was flower life but flower had to pull all the ingredients from the earth to manifest flower life it was flower spirit amen but you can't see flower spirit but the flower the spirit remember plants have a spirit animals have a spirit you couldn't take flower spirit and see it so flower spirit amen when it was quickened on the inside of that seed had to pull from the dirt all the ingredients it would need to manifest flower life you eat food and what do you do from it you're drawing from the dirt you're drawing from the elements you're drawing and piecing your body together so that what so that this earth amen that's been redeemed by god can manifest the life that's in the seed on the inside because you can't see it with the natural eye but you can see the manifestation of the life that's on the inside and you couldn't say mrs jesus christ what's mrs jesus christ i don't understand mrs jesus christ until the life of mrs jesus christ takes the elements of the earth builds up a body and the life of mrs jesus christ is on display on the earth and then you can say ah i see mrs jesus christ amen the same thing that he did there he's doing here praise god let's read that again now the son was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which are part of the dirt also to life was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around a life not all men will receive christ oh no but those which god forbaned life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one he comes to quicken they are the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun is hot that means your flesh didn't like the word the first time you heard it don't drink don't smoke don't wear shorts you know stop cutting your hair dress like a lady act like a man oh my goodness how am i ever going to do this the dirt didn't so much like it you realize that the dirt didn't so much like it but something on the inside he said now the dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh that old sun is too hot it's so hot that rock said this old sun is so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and it began to spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt but to quicken the life of the seed oh catch that friends it come to quicken the life of the seed amen there's a seed amen that's the soul but there's got to be a life in that soul that he can quicken and it's got to be his life that's laying in the seat that he can quicken now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't sin why won't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to them he said a guy told me i don't believe i don't care what you'd say if you could raise up the dead or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe it i said certainly not you're an unbeliever it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't even sent to you it's sent to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them that perish it's foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed it's life part of that seed which seed the faith seed of abraham one seed not many one which is christ part of christ the seat shall not be heir with the shuck 1965 that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he's the bridegroom and the bride is part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created him male and female and then genesis 2 he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying hear the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ remember there's the germ or the life or the spirit that's inside the seed the predestinated seed amen and in god i mean it's a it's a part of christ it's a part of his own life amen and when the holy ghost begins to brood over that it's not brooding over to to to just touch the dirt amen it's looking for the life that is in the seed it's looking to bring the life that is already trapped in the seed he says and he says flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word what is that on the inside of the predestinated believer it's the word it's the word god is the word what is the bible the word of god what what are written in the bible the believer are the words in the bible what is that inside of you what is that life it's the life of the word inside of you a seed is the word it's word of his word life of his life and broken cisterns brother bram says no pumping up it's power it's within itself it needs no priming he's talking about an artesian well you don't pump it up it's just flowing it needs no priming yes sir for itself its own life is in itself i want you to catch this friends he's talking about an artesian well and and jesus says that when the spirit comes into you you become an artesian well right you become a well flowing rivers of living water flowing out of your bellies you drink from the well you become the well and when the spirit comes into you you become an artesian wow and brother baby says you don't pump it up you know it's power is within itself it needs no priming yes sir for itself its own life is in itself that's the way the seed of god is in a man's heart the life of god is within the individual not in the church in you it's in you you're the one that has the germ of life in you now when the holy ghost in the beginning and chaos begin to brood over and part the waters and begin to brood and bring the word of god into manifestation and let the life strike that seed there was a certain life already in that seed and when that certain part of that life was quickened alive amen it became what it was predestinated to be when it was planted because there was something inside of it a genetic code a dna amen that was already it was already pre-wired it was already pre-programmed to be what it was going to be and the brooding of the holy ghost was bringing it higher and higher and higher to manifest what was the life that was already inside the sea and when god sowed his seed in this earth he knew what was inside of that seed and he sowed a seed in you and he sowed a seed in all his predestinated elected seed of god what is it it's a portion of his word it's an attribute of himself amen it's a piece of who god if it's a piece of god and you realize friends if it's a piece of god amen god knows where it's laying and he's going to send the brooding of the holy ghost to take the chaos and part the waters and let the light of the word strike that because that's a life that has to come into manifestation pre-programmed to manifest the bride in this day and the brooding of this moving of the holy ghost the brooding of the spirit is to bring it into greater manifestation and greater manifestation and greater manifestation because it's already programmed to be what it's going to be but it was laying there dead it was laying there without form it was laying there with no manifestation but there had to be something that would spark it into manifestation something that would quicken it to life so that it could go into action and start producing what it was programmed to produce and the move of the spirit the the baptism of the holy ghost come down upon that little seed and it sparked it to life it ignited it lit off the candle it did something amen to put into action what was already inside to start moving into manifestation if there was nothing there no matter how much the holy ghost cooed nothing's coming out of that dirt you realize it's two parts it's male and female it's two parts one is calling to the other and one is drawing the other and one is connecting to the other there's two parts positive and negative male and female and the holy ghost brooding amen it doesn't matter how powerful the holy ghost is it can't convert it cannot convert dirt with no life into life the life already had to be in the seed from a previous civilization from before the destruction from before the fall in the garden of eden there had to be a life amen that was going to be sown in this day and that life and god knew where that seed was and he knew how to move the spirit to get all the conditions right so that the right light and the right water and everything would hit that seat at the right time because there's already something in the seed it didn't come to put something in the seed it come to quicken what was already in the seed and spark it into life god did not make you a son of god you've always been a son of god amen and the new birth didn't turn you into a son of god the new birth was the spark it was the lighting of the candle it was the sparking off it was the holy ghost coming down and touching that other part of itself to bring up what was already in the seed and the holy ghost is still here brooding over his bride to bring her into more manifestation and more manifestation the holy ghost is powerful the word of god is powerful and when the word of god is preached and the fullness of his power it'll bring life but only if life is already there you understand it's not taking a cock-a-boo and turning it into a wheat it was a wheat before it was planted it was a cocker bird before it was planted before the waters parted it was already a palm tree or an apple tree or a wee the holy ghost was just moving bringing in the manifestation the life that was already inside and the preaching of the word is powerful and it can and brother bam said when when we're preaching we're holding the holy ghost out over the people and then people can reach up and grab it there can be a connection that is made amen but it's not taking and taking just dirt and turning it into a son of god it's quickening it's bringing forth the sons and daughters of god it's the move of the holy ghost it's the brooding of the holy spirit to bring forth what is already predestinated to be hallelujah it's not like we're seeking to get something else what we have is already on the inside we just want god to spark it in the life we want god to light it off we want god to brood over it and let the warmth of the sun bring it up higher and bring it up higher and bring it but it's got to come from the life on the inside if you wasn't pre-programmed to be the bride of jesus christ and the bride age then it'll take no effect on you but if you were pre-programmed the seed in you is a bride seed for a bright age then the word of this age will quicken and spark it to life and brood over it to bring it higher and higher into that manifestation not changing but brooding over and drawing out what's already there listen he says in the rising of the sun the eagle recognized the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle not an eagle to a chicken who decides not to be a chicken anymore and turns himself into an eagle and you realize the eagle scream couldn't convert one chicken into an eagle the eagle scream when it flew over the barnyard was to call forth the life that was already in the eagle and bring an eagle into the manifestation of an eagle not to create an eagle oh hallelujah that's why when you heard the message amen for me when i first heard the message something in my brain was confused this is nothing like what i've heard before i was raised in church i was taught doctrine a certain way we had a certain shallow understanding of the bible and i began to hear the message and all of a sudden in my mind it's like this doesn't compute this doesn't add up i don't know how this matches what i've been taught but something on the inside was quivering under the word we listened to the preaching of the word and something inside something was happening to something on the inside but it wasn't my brain because my brain was confused i wanted to believe what my grandpa believed i wanted to believe what my uncle believed i wanted to believe what my parents believed but i found out i was an unbeliever in their doctrine because i was a true believer in the true word of god and i was a believer from before the foundation of the world i'd always been a believer because i was part of the word and when i come in contact with the word something on the inside began to move around men could recognize that's the truth it was an eagle to an eagle not an eagle to a chicken it was an eagle to an eagle that thought it was a chicken because the eagle had amnesia it didn't know where it came from didn't know who its parents was didn't know that had been taken from up on high and brought down to the earth and hatched out under a denominational system it didn't have any recollection of that amen it just it was just trying it was an eagle under the deception of the day trying to live out the manifestation it saw around it but that eagle was living a lie because it wasn't a chicken but it was trying to act like a chicken but that eagle was an eagle born an eagle eagle genes eagle blood it was an eagle but it took an eagle scream to wake up the eagle life on the inside and what happened it began to rise and connect eagle connected to evil listen i'll read this again the real ego recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle the word before the found the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position the word predestinated what's that me to the word written for the hour when they come together you realize your position brother brennaman thinking man's filthy says notice the word cannot deny itself then it is then it is satisfied or it is the it is the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there that's why you can no more be lost and god can be lost that's why when jesus was on earth he had needs to go by samaria because there was a little seed gene of eternal life laying there that needed to be quick in the life god couldn't let you go he had to come and find you he couldn't let me go he had to come and find me praise be to god it was a little seed with which was eternal life always laying in there god's provided a place of worship as i said the other day when god moved and struck the sun across the earth he knowed them palm trees and everything was laying down there under the earth they was part of the earth at that time so were you so were you and when he raised up the son of god on easter morning and sent forth the holy spirit it was to quicken also the seed of eternal life that he foreknew before the foundation of the world that would be here he knew you would be here now and you didn't find him he found you and he's still brooding over you to bring you into full manifestation let's go to galatians chapter four we've quoted this but let's read it together galatians chapter four galatians chapter 4 verse 6 and because you are sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father you didn't become a son after he spent the spirit of his son in your heart you were a son so he sent the spirit into your heart whereby you cry abba father because you are sons because you are sons always were sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father and back the things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god is because you you have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and it's been it was laying in you i should say it this way dormant not really dormant because what is it it's eternal life it's eternal life when brother when brother bam talked about those seeds that was laying in the earth shrouded in darkness he said those seeds had been germinated they were already alive they just needed to wait for the condition to be right to manifest the light that was inside something had to spark them off to begin to grow but they already had the life inside of them but it took a life to them to quicken the life inside of them praise be to god it was the life of god the gene of your life spiritual tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god well i don't want to be anything else than that hey you're nothing but but i thought i was a farmer i thought no you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god god just wanted to manifest himself amen he wanted to manifest himself as a farmer a barber a mailman a mother a father a teenager a student a child an older person amen god wanted to manifest himself as a widow as a widower god wanted to manifest himself you're nothing but the manifestation of the life that was in god in the beginning in whatever form or condition or place you find yourself god is wanting to manifest the life his own life and manifestation and the spirit of god is brooding in every situation to pull that life out every terrible circumstance you go through the spirit of god is still there brooding to pull a greater manifestation of that light to draw the seed up higher we're going to stop resisting all of these things and start recognizing it's god moving me to manifest his life but this is terrible it's terrible but god still wants to manifest his life in this body of flesh in this tabernacle he wants to quicken this mortal body to live his life upon this earth wherever i'm at and whatever title is labeled on me in whatever circumstance i'm in it's not the time to crawl in a hole and suck our thumbs and have a pity party when things go wrong it's time to stand on our feet and say god i can in my mind understand what's happening but if this is what you want let me manifest your life in this situation whatever you pre-ordain when you pre-program that life inside of me you're trying to draw something out and oh god draw it out now i yield to your brooding i yield to your moving move me into that place you want me to be it was the spirit of god moving jesus to calvary who do you think turned the hearts of his disciples against him why because there was word laying there that had to be made manifest who do you think turned the pharisees against him what was it why why was it amen everyone turned against him why was it the crowds dispersed why was it they all why because there was word there and he was that portion of that word to be displayed in that day he was the lamb slain before the foundation was he was the sacrifice so he had to manifest the life of the sacrifice in order to manifest the life of the sacrifice god had to put every piece into position so that he could manifest the life of the sacrifice it looked like everything was falling apart and everything was working against him but everything was working perfect on time to manifest the life that was inside of him because he was the lamb of god and you can tell by the way he prayed it wasn't the human desire in his mind that wanted to go there but there was something deeper inside that was compelling him to live the life live the life live the life and you're nothing oh i don't want to be nothing god help us be nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean you are you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life you understand that what it's what is it zoe life where was the zoe life in the seed what came to zoe life to quicken zoe life zoe life came to zoe life to quicken zoe life the seed the life the germ of the seed in jesus day that germ was released to come back amen and touch the germ of the seed in my life to quicken it to life life come to life word come to word the word predestinated to the word written for the age they connected male and female come together to bring forth the manifestation of the life that's on the inside praise be to god he says if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation a world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but children sons and daughters of the living god if it be that eternal life dwells in you an eagle to an eagle zoe life to zoe life do we understand male to female there was something always there that's why when we witness to people we realize this message isn't for everybody you can't change what seed's already laying there you can't change it it's there that's why when we witness and we testify we don't stress out when people come and people go and people visit a few times and they don't come back they come once they never come they come and stay you realize we've got no control over that and we don't want to start pressing people through a human emotion oh no no please come back one more time no no no would you please stay no we're not looking for that kind of conversion that's not a conversion what we need is we need somebody just to hear the word of god and let the holy ghost begin to brood over the chaos in their lives until they can strike down till an eagle can scream to an eagle and an eagle can hear the eagle scream we're not trying to chain chickens down in their seats and say if you sit here long enough you'll believe like i believe they could sit here forever and not believe like you believe because there's nothing inside to believe this message with it's got to be a seed that's already planted we stress out so much over who's going to listen who's going to come and how will i get them to listen don't stress about nothing let god do the brooding amen you just shine the light of the age you just speak the word and love you speak the truth and love and if there's a resting place for that word if there's a connection it'll make the connection that was a hard connection to make that day when jesus was on earth to connect with that woman who had lived the life of a prostitute in samaria do you realize what a difficult connection that was you know the jews have no dealing with the samaritans jesus with a good reputation should never be alone with a woman of a bad reputation you realize she couldn't even go to the well when all the other women go to the well she had to go at a different time for people of a bad character and then you realize that that jesus wasn't even dealing in the realms of samaria so much he was working elsewhere in the ministry it was a hard connection to make that day but nobody had to figure it out for her and nobody had to figure it out for christ but there was a life inside of him the life of the father that was moving him to hunt out the seed because the spirit of god when it moved is brooding over to bring up the seed and god like a heat-seeking missile went down at the right time of the day he went to a place where the jews didn't want to be and a people where they didn't want to associate to a well at the wrong time of the day and then he sent his disciples away because he couldn't have any questions or doubt or unbelief to hinder this and then she come along and they made a connection and something happened on the inside if god can work that out for her what about your co-worker what about your friend what about your family member god has a plan we're not here to stress ourselves and to worry ourselves sick we're here to commit things to god and believe and brother branham said when he applies the token it wasn't you begging your family to come to church and then applying the token is having the same faith that converted you the same faith you have in your salvation is the same faith you have and their salvation you just believe god will do it and then let god do it amen why because if there's not something there all we're going to do is frustrate people and frustrate ourselves god knows where it's at and brother said not every seed comes up in the same season the sun shines and you've got early an early harvest and early starters and things that come up in in late spring things that come up in summer and things that are a fall plant thing amen not everything comes up in the same season but all the life will come up if there's a germinated seed laying there it'll come up it may not come up when you think it should come up but it'll come up when it was pre-programmed to come out of the ground and it may be the last one and the last moment at the last and then the last stroke of midnight before the last chime dings it doesn't matter if it's a predestinated seat it'll be there we've just got to we just got to believe committed to god and believe that he's more able to meet them at a well somewhere than you are praise be to god thinking man's filter what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in god at the beginning standing here drawing the seed life the seed is in your heart by foreign nation hallelujah the seed is already in there by foreknowledge of god predestination and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word this has nothing to do with intellect the seed on the inside can't draw through anything else but the word not even what you think about the word it can only draw from the word further in thinking mansfield 3 says but a thinking woman won't take that kind of thing she knows she's got to be holy and the only thing that you can draw through god's word is the spirit the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest jesus christ in the age you're living hallelujah brother if that ain't the truth i don't know what the truth is i've lost my mind if that isn't the truth he hasn't lost his mind he's the one in that day who had the mind of christ he had the right mind he may have lost a denominational mind but he had the mind of christ it's the word itself in your heart predestinated there that's drawing what's drawing not your mind but it's the seed it's the life on the inside that is drawing on that word not your mind because sometimes you hear things that you can't add up you can't repeat you can't compute but something inside says amen brother that's the truth and then when you get home your wife says what was that he said i don't know i can't retell it but it was the truth why because something on the inside's drawing not the mind amen the mind is so easily confused it's so easily swayed it's so easily persuaded from one thing to another thing and you see people flop from one idea to another idea we ourselves will we'll we'll flop from one idea to another idea we think this is certainly right no no no this is certainly right no something in between is certainly right because the mind can't draw on that word and get anywhere but something on the inside that come from the foundation before the foundation of the world it's the very life of god it's the word itself a portion of it inside of you that is drawing through the internet forget it through the emotion forget it it's drawing that word and it's growing into a greater manifestation praise god let's turn to first peter look at another scripture here aren't you so glad you didn't have to do anything you realize this takes away all the works programs it just smashes all the it even takes away the whole idea of i have to have a certain sensation or a certain experience brother branham said the new birth is his personal experience you have to have an experience and he said it's the experience of your candle being lit something sparking off life you have to make contact with a living god and it has to spark something to life and you activate something in the action bring the seed that's dormant into action there's got to be a contact you've made there's got to be an experience that you have but your experience doesn't have to match anybody else's experience it's personal to you and it's something where something inside of you changed it shifted whatever it was is different amen i feel different i think different amen everything in me is changing the holy ghost is brooding over me and whatever that was i'm changing and changing and changing and changing it's a change but you don't have to have a certain sensation or a certain dynamic this or a certain dynamic that what you have to have is you have to meet that spark of life that sparks the spark inside amen whether something inside is waiting for something to make contact with it to bring it into manifestation and when that happens that's a new birth it's the baptism holy ghost the genuine baptism of the holy ghost brother-in-law says or i'm sorry first peter 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed that's your first birth that was corruptible seed being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible so you're going to be born again of an incorruptible seed by the word of god the word has to come to the incorruptable seed in the heart that is the word there's something in you that's zoe life that it come from god that is incorruptible and the life of that word has to meet the life of the word and it's got to be born again or coming to manifestation the corruptable seed's already there the the incorruptable seed is already there waiting for the word life to come and spring it into action power of transformation brother man said let the holy spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there do you realize the holy ghost can come on somebody that doesn't have anything down there but let the holy spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there listen to what he's going to say just catch it let the holy spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there a healing comes from the inside let that healing come from the spirit that's in you if it's genuine spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a son or daughter of god but the genuine spirit can come upon a cocker bird seed and the rain can fall upon a cockroach and it will make it live just the same as it falls upon the wheat and makes it live but by their fruits you know them see and we're a fruit tree of god bearing his word amen the they're in the condition now where the bright shining light of the word is going to bring every seed that's in the field to full harvest maturity it's going to bring it out of the ground and it's going to bring it to full harvest maturity every seed that was in the ground in genesis 1 amen come forth every seed that had life and it would come forth and in this day god is bringing everything back to fruit again so we can see the two vines we can see what happened in the garden but this holy ghost is there if the holy ghost comes down on anything that's got life in there it'll quicken it to life god's power to transform he says god through a seed of his word and there is only one thing that can quicken the word and that is the spirit for it's the life giver to the word and when the life in the word i love all these terms brother branham he's speaking all this right at the end of his ministry in the last several months of his ministry he says and the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces what whatever the seed is these two lifes come together these two spirits come together amen these the eagle to the eagle word to word life to life zoe to zoe do you understand you're always been a son of god you'll never not be a son of god and it was never dependent on your merit it was never dependent on your conduct that's why trying to act right and do good amen it's nothing more than an effort amen that will not produce life amen but life comes from the seed and when the life is quickened the life the outcrop is the life of jesus christ you just quit drinking you quit smoking you quit womanizing you quit pornography you quit all those other things but we have so many people trying to quit all of that so they can receive a new birth but it's the new birth that pushes all that out of our life we get the whole thing backwards and we're pressing people amen to beat on an altar and to cry out amen and to be under constant turmoil amen there's nothing they can do about it [Applause] there is nothing all that we can do is sit under the word and say god quicken me to life god quickened me to life god quickened me to life i'm willing to die i'm willing to give it up but god you've got to do something there's got to be something more than my effort because my effort is failing there's got to be something more than my good conduct because i can't keep a good report card lay in the presence of the son and say god i know this word is true and there's something stirring me that says it's true god i believe it's true but i need something would you like to candle in me would you let that spark hit lord so to bring the life what's inside of me because i can't do it on my own i need the life that's pre-programmed in the seed to be brooded over by the holy ghost and brought up into a manifestation and bear its own fruit [Music] praise god we put ourselves under so much when what he needs is yielded he doesn't need human efforts he needs a yielded life he needs a recognition of what's true and just say god whatever you are i want to be there's a desire down in me that i can't explain there's a desire in my heart that is unexplainable it didn't come by education i didn't rub off from a mother or father but there's a real desire inside of me for you it must mean that i'm part of you god i'm willing to die just bring this part to life just stay there until something quickens you can't make anything you can't force it you can't push your way into it all you can do is ask god to bring a spark of life to the seed inside of me you know what if he's put something in you to believe for that how many people in the world want that how many people in the world really want to live this message you take all the prophet taught and all that was said and then you tie it in with all the rejection that's coming and all and everything who really wants to live that the children of god the ones that are pre-programmed to it they want to live it they want to manifest it they want it brown says it is the rising of the sun so now then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys of death and hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained it to do and what a wonderful thing that is i'm alive i am alive or quickened the word means the word quicken the greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again every bit of you has to die the seed your soul the essence of who you are every bit of you has to die and rot just like a natural seed everything has to die all your hopes all your dreams all your ambitions your plans for the future your feelings about stuff your emotions it's all got to die and every bit i like what i said every bit every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again all of you all of you and your personal makeup as you've come down through this life the essence and core of who you are it's got to die so that all that you were predestinated to be and all the life that's inside of you can come forth when one dies in rot another springs to life say god i'm just laying here dying to myself i'm just laying here rotting to all my ideas so that every bit of the life inside of me can come to life where is it it's already there it's already there it just had the conditions have to get right for it to spring to life let's look at ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 i can see we're not going to get much further praise the lord ephesians 2 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins he's quickened them to life who were dead and trespasses and sins you realize that real zoe life on the inside that that seed gene the germ of god inside can never die but everything else was dead in sins and trespasses it was dead and unbelief it was dead to the things of god amen but he's got to take that deadness and quicken it to life because there's life on the inside and life has to connect with life let's go to colossians 2 and 13. just a couple books over colossians 2 and 13 and you being dead in your sins in the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses you were dead in unbelief you were dead to the things of god you were dead to the life that was on the inside although that life could never be dead you understand that that zoe life eternal life it could never be dead but it was laying there inactive it wasn't it wasn't i don't even want to say inactive because it's the thing that's moved to your whole life but it was inactive to you you were dead to it you were clouded in unbelief and misunderstanding and wrong theology and wrong actions and you're laying there dead to it amen and all of a sudden something comes to spark at the life and it takes over and you realize i'm a son of god he says brother baby says in the message the rapture then how do we get into this body first corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all baptized in this body by one holy spirit baptism that if you want to put that down it's first corinthians 12 13 and by one spirit we're all baptized and the spirit is the life of christ is that right the life of christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life you got it the life of any seed brings the seed to life what's the life of the seed that's inside of you christ and the life of christ brings the seed of christ to life why they're kindred seeds amen it takes a male and a female to come together to spark to life and it takes the spirit of the seed and the life of the seed and the spirit of the seed come together and quicken the life hallelujah and the spirit is of the is the life of christ is that right and the life of christ and the life of any seed which was the word seed brings the seed to life you get it if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the holy spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed to life if that life is laying in the seed remember it's got to be that life in the seed of your soul but if that life isn't there then the baptism the holy ghost can't bring it to life if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the holy spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed to life he said in a modern event it's made clear by prophecy this is just two days later notice we find today that there are many people just can't believe even spirit-filled people this is the heavy part we're getting to the heavy part because we want to talk about the move of the spirit many people just can't believe even spirit filled people i'm going to give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the holy ghost don't mean you're getting you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism see here's the inside soul in here that has to come from god but then on the outside you have five senses five inlets contact your earthly home the inside you have a spirit and there you have five outlets your conscience love and so forth the five outlets to the spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of god and still be lost it's the soul that lives that was ordained of god so what's the move of the spirit to do what's the baptism of the holy ghost for many people don't believe even spirit filled people don't believe brother said receiving the baptism in the lagos don't mean you've made it so having a wonderful spiritual experience doesn't mean we've made it having sensations and getting excited and running around amen and feeling and it's the genuine outpouring of the holy ghost it's a genuine move of the spirit it's genuine and real and really god and it brings a real enthusiasm and excitement but that still doesn't mean we've arrived the baptism of the holy ghost has to connect with a life on the inside of the seed and quicken that the life and that's the new birth that's the reason the spirit moved in the first place and sometimes amen we can be in a service or we can be in a place where the spirit of god begins to move what is the spirit of god looking for it's looking for the life down inside that seed to quicken it to life but many people can feel the spirit fall many people can feel the spirit of god and move through the assembly but that's not the reason it fell just to make people feel something it fell to bring seed to life that's the important part the seed the life and when the seed comes to life brother brown said what's the evidence of the new birth that it recognizes the word for its day and it receives all the word and doesn't choke on the word and not afraid to move with the word and as the light moves it moves with the light it'll receive what it'll the spirit of god will lead and guide you into all truth the truth you know now the truth you know 10 years ago the truth that's going to be revealed to you tomorrow brother said it's the evidence there's an experience and then there's an evidence you have to have the experience the experience is what lights it off but the experience has to bring a genuine evidence amen that's why you see the the spirit of god move that spirit of god might have moved through an assembly for one seed and you have people who have a wonderful service and a wonderful and it's wonderful we love those things i want more and more and more of that but that's why people they'll have an experience like that and they'll go right back out and that same night or the next night they'll be viewing pornography on their computer thinking that they received the baptist how he goes and it was a baptism only goes in the spirit realm but there's got to be something in the soul that's quick in the life and changed there's got to be a change there's got to be another life the old life has to rot out and this life has to take over and the holy ghost has to draw us up into another manifestation of another life it can't be a wonderful experience at the altar and go right back and live the exact same life there's got to be a change and it doesn't mean that we grow to full maturity at the altar there's room for growth we'll fall we'll make mistakes we'll do things that's wrong but the brooding of the holy ghost is bringing more life and more life and more life it's not just the experience but it's the experience that quickens the seed to life that'll bring forth the right evidence that'll live the life and follow after the word and receive all of the word not reject it because i've never heard that before is it true the holy ghost will lead and guide us into all truth you see so many things carried over from a previous age you think sometimes the greatest experience we can have is the baptism of the holy ghost don't get me wrong i i'm not trying to say anything wrong just stick with me but the greatest experience we can have is when the baptism of the holy ghost quickens the seed in the soul not just the baptism the holy ghost but the baptism of holy ghost that quickens the life the seed that's in the soul that's the experience friends it's more than just an enthusiasm it's more than excitement the side effect can be thrilling and exciting and should be and it can come super dynamic and it can come super simple it doesn't matter whether it's super dynamic or super simple but there's got to be an experience where your candles lit and now something's burning light comes the light to make light manifest life comes to life zoe comes to zoe eagle comes the eagle male comes the female and something happens and quickens the life and from that point on everything begins to change in our life that's the thing that matters the most and that's what the spirit of god is moving upon in a service so many times in such a dynamic way it's hunting out the woman at the well maybe one maybe 50 maybe a hundred maybe the whole room i don't care how many of it is but if the spirit of god is moving that way he's looking for a seed and then the spirit of god continues to brood over all of those seeds for the rest of your life on this earth that spirit begins to move and it's moving in good ways and it's moving in difficult ways and it's moving in challenging circumstances moving in blessings but the spirit of god is moving what's it doing it's moving that seed into greater manifestation moving from the womb of a virgin into a baby moving the from a baby to a 12 year old in the temple moving from the 12 year old the temple to the one working a miracle at the at the wedding feast moving from there to the one who's rejected by the masses moving from there to one who's rejected by the sanhedrin rejected by the council rejected by his own disciples what is that the move of the spirits moving him to be hated of the nation despised and rejected what is it the moving of the spirit to what to bring the seed life into full manifestation how many of us want the moving of the spirit oh be careful what you raise your hands for because it might be rejection amen it might be political it might be friends and family and churches it might be your very closest friends leaving you and telling you you got it all wrong but the move of the spirit is moving the seed into greater manifestation drawing the life of what was in god's mind coming to manifestation and the spirit is cooing over the sea come a little higher come a little higher come a little higher oh i want a genuine move of the spirit i don't just want to walk out of here excited and say wasn't that a good service wasn't that glory hallelujah if it didn't change me into a greater manifestation i want to question why it happened because the moving of the spirit is to move us move us into a greater manifestation move the word into a greater display and if god's doing something wonderful i'm going to ask myself the question what's he trying to do in my life what is growing what's he taking off what's he building up what's he drawing out something's moving friends i think we can see worldwide the spirit of god is moving we may not fully comprehend all that's happening and we don't have to fully comprehend all that's happening all we have to know is one thing this is god and why is he allowing it why is it happening because he's got a bride that has to come into full manifestation why is the world turning upside down because he's got a bride that's got to come into full manifestation if he's got to tax the whole world if he's got to move from here to here if he's got to upturn communities if he's got if he got to change lives and make people uncomfortable praise the god he's going to get his life on full display and that is a move of the spirit it may feel good at times and to the flesh it may feel bad at times but what is it producing in the way of a life sometimes god has moved in my life in such a ways has crushed me and dropped me to my knees to weep all night long but guess what he was drawing this life higher the plant was growing the bride tree was coming a little higher and god was brooding in the church ages to bring that life that was in the root in the bride tree back back through luther back through wesley back through pentecost back into fruit again amen he's been drawing it drawing it drawing it drawing it drawing it but what he did for the ages he's doing for you personally drawing us and drawing us and drawing us till we can bear the same fruit that he bore remember brother benham said he and she is the tree of life male and female the two trees in the garden of eden male and female coming together sparking off life and the brooding of the holy ghost to draw that life into full manifestation that's the move of the spirit i'm looking for and that's the one i see god moving god bless you friends let's all stand we'll have to finish some other time praise god we trust the lord has god been moving in your life has the holy ghost been brooding over you i'd ask the question is the manifestation in your life greater now than it was a year ago is your confidence in god in his word is it higher or lower than it was what's he doing drawing the life out of the seed there's more to draw friends we haven't arrived yet let's not fool ourselves and think that we've made it to the destination there's more life to come out of this seed there's more faith amen there's more confidence in the word there's more of the very image of jesus christ to come forth there's more to come out of the seed i know there's more to come out of my seat so i know the spirit needs to keep cooing over me and drawing me up higher but oh god how we want him his spirit to move among us and move us into a greater manifestation i want to get to the place where i say god if you begin by your spirit begins to move me to calvary i want to walk i want to be so in tune with your program that if your spirit is moving me to calvary i want to move just like christ moved when he was here on earth when you begin to move by your spirit into a place that was uncomfortable into a place that was going to hurt into a place that that was not friendly when i feel your spirit moving lord and i saw you drawing god i want to have the kind of faith that i can move even if you lead me to calvary amen god is drawing his seat higher i'm so thankful we don't have anything to do with it just yield it's his program friends this is his design he wired you to sit there and nod your head and say amen he pre-programmed you to sit through a service like this and most people be like i want the blessings i want the money i want the prosperity i want the good living i want but you're you're sitting there and something inside of you when you can hear the word say but he might lead you to calvary you're like amen that's what i want where did that come from that's not the human part of you friends there's something inside that's saying i want what he wants i am programmed for this hour i am programmed to meet the challenge of the day and the spirit of god is here to make sure that the program keeps moving forward the spirit is moving this program forward and i'm more thankful for it than i've ever been for anything in my life i would have never requested circumstances like we have now would you well some of you maybe but i don't not me i would have never asked for circumstances like her coming next but god knows how to move his program alone and something inside of me can still say thank you lord something in me can still be excited about what he's doing when things are in turmoil things are uncomfortable and things may get more uncomfortable something inside still says i know you're moving god and i trust you and i want your way and i'm excited about the future when the future doesn't look exciting you know how many people are having meltdowns in their heart because it looks like the future is lost or changing or unknown but in the brine the future looks tumultuous and different and changing and inside of her she says amen something's changing something's shifting let it change more let it change and change and change and change and change until i change praise god keep moving lord keep moving keep drawing keep friends let's keep laying in the presence of the sun let him keep moving us in the greater manifestation let's close our eyes and pray lord jesus we thank you god we thank you for your word lord and how much it means to us and god we're looking for you to move lord and we're not just asking lord in fineries and things that are pleasant to the flesh but lord we really want you to move in our lives we're really asking lord that you would move and you'd be the bright powerful son that would draw us into a greater manifestation god we don't know lord in our human minds what to do and where to go but you've already put the life in the seed it's already there lord we know it's there we know lord your prophet said every apple that'll be on an apple tree was there in the seed and lord you've already ordained all the works that we'll do it's already in the seed everything you want us to do in this end time is already in the seed we just must draw from you lord and you must draw us in the manifestation god we know there's more there to be made manifest and we're trusting you to move over us and bring it into manifestation we love your god we're looking for a move of your spirit but not a pentecostal traditional idea of a move of your spirit but a real move of the spirit that moves us into manifestation of your word in a greater way and god if it's uncomfortable so be it we're still looking for a move of your spirit to move us in that portion for today to move us in the light of the hour to manifest that part that you've predestined for us to manifest and god if there's any here lord that has that little quivering down in the soul but know that they haven't sparked to life yet but there's something there lord that they know that's real god i pray that you would send the spark now in jesus christ's name lord light that candle spark it off lord and let it come to life and let there be a realization of a new birth take place lord i pray to give each child of god an experience lord of the new birth that they would experience making contact with you and that would be something fiery take place on the inside and that they would know it was real and everlasting and from there lord keep brooding and cooing and drawing us up higher that we can move into that very image of you to where she will be you we're asking for that to take place in our lives and we're knowing that it comes at a personal cost but lord as christ was willing in gethsemane to pay the price let us hit our gethsemane now and say we're willing to pay the price to let your word move in us a greater manifestation of your promised word we love you lord we ask that you'd keep your people that you would bless us to protect us and watch over us as we go in this world let us be bright in shining lights wherever we should go and let your life live through us we ask you to take preeminence among us and do with us as you wish in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you have a song let's sing this song together it's manifesting time the fruits are on the vine is sweeping over the mountains over the hills he runs i long to hear
