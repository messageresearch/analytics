[8:43] house of the lord
[8:44] thank you for all your prayers and
[8:46] anticipation
[8:48] you're not waiting upon a man
[8:52] but upon him the lord so that's
[8:55] wonderful
[8:56] um
[8:59] philippians chapter two um you can
[9:02] follow along with me also
[9:04] on the screen
[9:06] philippians
[9:08] chapter 2 we start with verse 5
[9:12] this morning i have a thought
[9:16] that
[9:17] came a few months ago
[9:19] as the pastor was preaching about the
[9:22] relationship versus religion
[9:25] you remember that
[9:27] and
[9:28] yeah things start just opening and
[9:33] keep building on it and keep adding
[9:36] things to it and other ministers too
[9:39] that came before me they just
[9:41] add things to us
[9:44] so wonderful
[9:45] we always preach what somebody else
[9:48] preached
[9:49] the day we don't do that
[9:53] be worried
[9:55] all right we always repeat what was said
[9:58] already in the bible in the message
[10:02] amen
[10:03] so
[10:04] uh philippians chapter 2 verse 5
[10:07] let this mind be in you which was also
[10:11] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[10:14] god thought it to not a robbery to be
[10:17] equal with god
[10:19] but made himself of no reputation and
[10:23] took upon him the form of a servant and
[10:26] was made in the likeness of men
[10:29] and being found in a fashion as a man he
[10:33] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[10:36] death even the death of the cross verse
[10:40] 9
[10:41] wherefore god also had highly exalted
[10:45] him and
[10:46] given him a name which is above every
[10:49] name
[10:51] that at the name of jesus
[10:53] every knee should bow
[10:56] of things in heaven things in earth and
[10:59] things under the earth
[11:00] and that every tongue should confess
[11:03] that jesus christ is lord
[11:05] to the glory of god the father
[11:09] may god add his blessing to the reading
[11:11] of the word in jesus christ's name amen
[11:15] you may be seated
[11:21] so
[11:22] i
[11:23] want to
[11:24] title this message
[11:27] the mind
[11:29] of
[11:30] jesus christ the mind of christ
[11:32] and with a separate subtitle of a
[11:35] blending time
[11:38] hopefully i will be able to express that
[11:41] the way i get i got it all right
[11:43] and that's the challenge right
[11:46] um so the mind of christ blending time
[11:52] so
[11:54] the word let
[11:57] that we start with
[11:58] if i go back and say
[12:01] let
[12:02] this mind be in you which mind
[12:05] the mind of jesus christ
[12:08] let it be in you
[12:11] so
[12:13] let is to allow
[12:17] allow the mind of christ to be in you
[12:21] give it permission
[12:23] you see the holy ghost is a gentleman
[12:27] he's asking for permission but god has
[12:30] already made provision for you to accept
[12:32] it
[12:34] he has made provision that for you to
[12:37] open
[12:38] because allow is uh open uh is
[12:43] let is open
[12:45] is you say let me in right
[12:48] you say to somebody let me in what i
[12:50] mean
[12:51] open for me right
[12:53] and god believes that
[12:56] that's your desire
[12:58] that's what you want to do
[13:01] and
[13:03] you want you want it he wanted
[13:07] so now he's just telling you because
[13:10] that's what god does he keeps his church
[13:13] by preaching to it
[13:15] by
[13:16] telling her
[13:17] the word
[13:20] give permission to it to him
[13:23] allow
[13:24] the mind of christ
[13:28] to come in and dwell in you
[13:32] is that right what a power that is given
[13:36] to us
[13:37] because we can open or we can close
[13:41] but god believes that we will open to
[13:44] him
[13:46] is that
[13:46] right and what is the mind of christ is
[13:50] is
[13:51] character
[13:53] is
[13:54] nature
[13:56] and if we dig
[13:58] deeper
[13:59] into the mind of
[14:01] christ we will find out his mind is his
[14:04] word
[14:06] is that right
[14:08] so open to the word of god the
[14:11] revelation of the word of god
[14:14] and never when you hear the word and
[14:17] never say
[14:18] this is too hard or too harsh
[14:22] the first thing we do when we hear the
[14:24] word of god is to say amen to it
[14:27] and that's how you open
[14:30] you open by saying
[14:32] i don't know how it's going to take
[14:35] place
[14:36] but i say amen to it
[14:39] and that's the beginning
[14:41] is to say amen to the word of god
[14:45] are you with me
[14:49] that's the mind of christ
[14:52] let it
[14:53] what a power that has been given to us
[14:57] there's a place here
[14:59] maybe i will read it later
[15:01] there is uh
[15:03] maybe a sister
[15:04] who's asking brother branham a question
[15:07] and but it didn't hard to refill refer
[15:10] to uh refer to it last time
[15:14] and she's asking i cannot give myself
[15:18] entirely to the lord
[15:22] why is this is that any bad spirit in
[15:25] man
[15:26] if you
[15:27] look at the
[15:29] answer from brother branham he's saying
[15:32] to the sister
[15:33] why can't you
[15:36] why can't you give yourself to him
[15:40] why can't you and you look at all the
[15:43] answer is explaining her how
[15:46] what it is to give yourself to
[15:49] and to christ but is not
[15:53] giving her an answer is actually ask her
[15:57] why not
[15:59] because all the things that if you are a
[16:02] girl everything you have kept pure
[16:06] now you're giving it to the man in whom
[16:08] you trust why is it hard for you to open
[16:13] to christ
[16:16] just open
[16:18] is something that god has left to us
[16:22] to do
[16:23] it's a power that we're giving back
[16:26] to him
[16:28] and when the mind of christ comes into
[16:31] us we start expressing
[16:35] christ
[16:37] we start expressing his attributes
[16:42] and sometimes
[16:44] it becomes so
[16:46] blurry
[16:48] that you cannot say was it god speaking
[16:51] oh my brother speaking
[16:54] and that's where god want us to get to
[16:57] where
[16:58] it's like blending in
[17:02] is it him
[17:03] is it brother branham
[17:05] or is it god
[17:07] now is it brother branham or now he's
[17:09] god
[17:10] it's a blending time and that's where
[17:12] god wants us to be
[17:15] because in this
[17:16] world christ has to be manifested in us
[17:24] to a point where somebody can say
[17:27] god came to visit me and
[17:29] another person would say was he really
[17:31] god
[17:33] was he was it an angel with how they
[17:36] describe it with wings
[17:40] no he was a human being but he was god
[17:44] was he god was he a man
[17:48] god want us to come to a point where
[17:50] people cannot distinguish between the
[17:52] two
[17:54] that's it
[17:56] that's what we are called to do
[18:00] by letting the mind of christ in us
[18:04] and let once he get in
[18:08] he cast out
[18:10] anything that is contrary
[18:12] the word of god is the light
[18:15] when it comes he casts out the shadow
[18:19] the the uh the darkness out
[18:23] and is a process
[18:25] it's a process that is takes time
[18:29] but as the light is coming and shines
[18:33] into all the region of your spiritual
[18:36] being
[18:37] the darkness now is cast out
[18:41] amen
[18:42] that's where we want to be
[18:44] so if there is if we're inviting the
[18:48] mind of christ it means we're shedding
[18:51] uh we're shutting the door to the mind
[18:54] of the antichrist
[18:58] enter word the spirit that is in this
[19:02] world
[19:04] we close the door
[19:06] the strong men get in the house
[19:09] the weak one get out
[19:13] now we want to talk a little bit about
[19:15] the weak one
[19:16] [Music]
[19:19] mind of god versus
[19:22] mind of christ versus mind of
[19:25] satan
[19:27] antichrist
[19:30] let's go to genesis chapter 4
[19:33] verse 3
[19:34] it says
[19:38] and
[19:39] in the process of time
[19:42] it came to pass that cane brought off
[19:45] the fruit of the ground and offering
[19:48] unto the lord
[19:50] and abel he also brought off the first
[19:54] length of his flock and of the fat
[19:58] thereof
[20:00] and the lord had respect unto abel
[20:03] and to his offering
[20:05] but unto cain
[20:07] and to his offering he had no respect
[20:10] and cain was very rough
[20:12] and his countenance fell
[20:16] now in a message of victory day preached
[20:20] in 1963
[20:22] what about him say that
[20:24] seeing that the two boys saw abel and
[20:29] cain
[20:30] trying to find favor with god to come
[20:34] back because they know that they were
[20:36] just fresh from the garden of life
[20:40] and they had fell on the other side by
[20:42] the transgression of their parents and
[20:45] had made them subject to death
[20:48] just like we all stand this morning
[20:51] subjects to death
[20:53] and they wanted to know how to get back
[20:55] into that place where they could find
[20:58] life again
[21:00] and in doing so they they were trying to
[21:04] find favor
[21:06] with god
[21:08] so
[21:10] uh the bible say in the process of time
[21:12] and brother branham say it was not too
[21:15] long after they left the garden
[21:18] they felt in their heart that something
[21:21] is not right
[21:22] just like you can feel like i feel empty
[21:25] brother pray with me and
[21:28] i don't i don't feel that presence of
[21:30] god i used to
[21:31] they see that there is a distance
[21:33] between them and god and they want to
[21:36] find favors
[21:38] therefore they went to offer
[21:42] an offering to god
[21:45] and let me tell you that about does not
[21:48] know what to offer
[21:51] but cain thinks he knows
[21:55] but
[21:56] ever say that there is nothing good in a
[21:59] human being to begin with
[22:02] and anything that god will honor is
[22:05] inspired by god himself
[22:08] therefore he went and prayed to the lord
[22:11] and say god tell me
[22:14] what can i offer you
[22:18] and god gave him a revelation something
[22:21] beyond what he could imagine
[22:25] a slain
[22:27] lamb
[22:29] that's what i'm requiring
[22:34] it didn't make sense to him the word
[22:36] doesn't make sense to us sometimes it's
[22:39] not because i preach the word it means i
[22:42] understand it i don't understand it
[22:46] but it's the truth
[22:48] amen
[22:50] it did not make sense to evil but he
[22:52] said since god said it
[22:55] i will follow it
[22:57] but cain say i know exactly what you
[23:01] what will please you i know exactly no
[23:04] what will please
[23:06] cain know exactly what uh to offer you
[23:11] and uh
[23:12] and he went and prepare an altar and
[23:15] decorate it and
[23:18] put flowers and
[23:20] fruits and
[23:21] beautiful
[23:24] they say
[23:26] look what i did for you
[23:30] we know the story
[23:35] god give to the two believers
[23:39] to the two worshipers god is giving them
[23:42] his feedback
[23:44] because it can only give you honest
[23:46] feedback
[23:48] it can only tell you the truth
[23:51] because jesus is the way the truth and
[23:54] the life
[23:56] it could only fade through to cain and
[23:59] say cain
[24:03] can ah
[24:03] imagine you know if we dramatize a
[24:06] little bit god looking at that
[24:09] altar
[24:11] and turn a look at abel although
[24:14] look
[24:16] he said
[24:17] my
[24:19] exactly what i saw up there
[24:23] exactly what is father
[24:26] lucifer did
[24:28] it was in the beauty
[24:30] he wants to present me the beauty
[24:34] how can i agree with him
[24:38] how can my soul agree with him
[24:41] you know
[24:43] god said look at it and say that
[24:48] each seed shall reproduce according to
[24:51] its own kind
[24:53] that's exactly right you see
[24:56] this boy
[24:57] is actually reproducing his father
[25:03] how can i
[25:05] agree with it he gave them
[25:08] his feedback
[25:10] sometimes god give us
[25:12] feedback when we come to church
[25:15] he inspired the pastor to give us
[25:17] feedback
[25:19] sometimes he can be harsh
[25:22] i can sometimes i
[25:24] live here shake a hand with a brother
[25:27] and the brother will tell me tell me
[25:28] something like oh today was a spanking
[25:33] but you see him happy even though he was
[25:36] spanked
[25:37] huh
[25:38] my my we love it because our father
[25:42] cares right
[25:43] that's why he gave us our f the feedback
[25:46] is
[25:48] so that we know what he really want us
[25:51] to do we know his will and we want to
[25:54] apply his will i want god feedback every
[25:58] day in my life
[26:00] but some people get really rough
[26:05] and they stick it as personal sometimes
[26:09] people even can leave church because
[26:12] they receive god's feedback through the
[26:15] pastor
[26:20] and you see where you can trace that
[26:22] spirit but god is calling us this
[26:26] morning
[26:27] to receive the mind of christ
[26:32] cast away the mind of
[26:35] the antichrist
[26:44] god gives him feedback
[26:47] and it was not good
[26:50] it was not good
[26:52] ah genesis chapter 4 verse 6
[26:57] and the lord said unto cain
[27:00] why are thou rough
[27:03] and why
[27:05] is thy countenance fallen
[27:09] cane i can look at your face
[27:12] your eyes
[27:14] you're so angry
[27:16] your countenance have fallen
[27:19] because i give you the feedback
[27:23] if thou
[27:25] if thou does
[27:26] well shalt thou not be accepted
[27:30] and if thou does not well sin life at
[27:34] the door and unto thee
[27:36] shall be
[27:38] his desire and thou shalt
[27:40] rule over him
[27:43] so god is giving
[27:46] god is following
[27:48] cain after his feedback and say kane why
[27:52] are you rough
[27:54] but i'm saying he say to cain and say
[27:57] just do like your brother evil and i
[27:59] will receive you
[28:01] but king can not do it
[28:06] it's just impossible but god is saying
[28:09] if you do
[28:10] i will
[28:14] but it cannot just stand the revelation
[28:20] do you agree with me
[28:25] you see god is
[28:27] pleading with cain and telling him that
[28:31] sin unbelief is
[28:34] outside your door
[28:37] don't open to it
[28:40] open to the mind of christ
[28:43] the lamb that was slain before the
[28:45] foundation of the world
[28:47] like your brother
[28:49] don't let that sin that spirit that is
[28:52] at your door don't open to it
[28:54] once you open to christ you close the
[28:57] door to that spirit
[29:01] but you don't know where that spirit can
[29:03] lead you
[29:05] it's hard to say where that spirit will
[29:07] lead you
[29:08] you will not have control over
[29:11] what it's going to do
[29:15] god plead
[29:19] god plead with cain
[29:22] god prophesy
[29:24] if you open to that spirit
[29:28] you don't know where it's going to lead
[29:29] you
[29:33] but we know what ken did
[29:37] you see
[29:38] cain the feedback
[29:43] to cane
[29:45] i wrote it down in my
[29:49] notes here
[29:51] feedback activate kane's shame
[29:56] it's not like you and i god tell me
[29:59] i want your perfect will in my life
[30:03] no
[30:05] feedback was
[30:07] shame
[30:08] in cain
[30:10] which shame the shame of his father
[30:13] when his father went to build a kingdom
[30:16] that was better than michael
[30:19] he didn't succeed
[30:21] he was thrown here
[30:23] and then
[30:25] you see
[30:26] his ambition never worked
[30:29] therefore the fact that god rejected his
[30:33] cane worship a trigger and activate that
[30:37] shame
[30:41] you and i we love god's feedback
[30:45] amen
[30:46] sometimes it's not what god god bless me
[30:50] with a job god bless me with this
[30:52] sometimes it's just god stop me from
[30:54] doing something that is not right
[30:57] you will appreciate it even more
[31:01] because when you look back
[31:03] you see how god spared your life
[31:07] you know
[31:08] do we agree
[31:10] amen
[31:15] genesis chapter 4
[31:17] verse 8
[31:20] and cain talked with abel
[31:24] his brother
[31:25] and it came to pass when they were in
[31:27] the field that cain
[31:29] rose up against abel his brother and
[31:32] through him
[31:35] and the lord said unto cain where is ab
[31:38] thy brother and he say
[31:41] i know not
[31:42] am i my brother's keeper
[31:48] my
[31:52] god prophecy
[31:56] was fulfilled
[32:00] sin lay at the door
[32:03] don't open to it
[32:06] but cane open
[32:10] and this is what happened
[32:14] you see
[32:16] abel forgot that
[32:20] people walk on eggshells
[32:23] around the cane
[32:26] i'm bringing it to a drama i'm bringing
[32:28] to the natural
[32:32] what an expression walking on eggshells
[32:36] you guys have heard it all your life it
[32:39] doesn't change anything for us to learn
[32:42] a different language it's kind of weird
[32:49] but so representative is really clear
[32:54] you know
[32:55] around the cane you gotta walk
[32:57] like eggshells
[32:59] you gotta be careful
[33:02] don't show that you are too happy
[33:08] don't start singing
[33:16] but because he was happy evil has
[33:20] received forgiveness of his sins
[33:23] because his his sins were under the
[33:26] blood
[33:28] so he must be very happy
[33:31] maybe he was going around and say
[33:33] oh revelation is so good
[33:37] oh i love the revelation
[33:40] oh
[33:41] and cain said
[33:44] why then when you get close to me you
[33:46] start singing
[33:51] well you say that's a tantrum a child
[33:54] tantrum that's what we're going through
[34:01] cain
[34:03] maybe
[34:05] one day the pastor was preaching here
[34:07] and say
[34:09] cain and abel must have spoken about
[34:12] revelation and maybe that same week i
[34:16] had the same idea
[34:17] it came to me papa because we tap in the
[34:21] same channel
[34:23] is the channel we tap on it
[34:26] that's why we
[34:27] preach the same thing
[34:30] so
[34:31] yeah
[34:32] he must have said oh hi king
[34:35] don't say hi to me
[34:38] do you love revelation don't talk to me
[34:41] about
[34:46] them i told you don't talk to me about
[34:49] revelation it killed him sorry for the
[34:52] graphic but that's what happened
[35:00] then god came
[35:03] and
[35:04] god asked cain
[35:07] where is
[35:09] your brother
[35:16] listen what he said to him
[35:18] am i my brother keeper
[35:21] cain
[35:23] lacks empathy
[35:26] he has no empathy
[35:29] this is a
[35:30] god's son because god does not have
[35:33] grandchildren
[35:36] so abel was his son
[35:39] and god
[35:40] we dramatized
[35:42] want to
[35:44] take his body and go bury it
[35:49] because can't kill him left him
[35:51] somewhere
[35:53] and god acting like he did not know like
[35:56] a human being where is the body of my
[35:58] son
[35:59] i want to give him a burial
[36:02] am i my brother's keeper
[36:06] church
[36:07] what a spirit is that
[36:09] no wonder god say don't let that spirit
[36:12] in you
[36:13] don't let that mind in you
[36:22] he lacks empathy
[36:24] god is crying for his son but cain
[36:28] is
[36:29] what the is condescending
[36:32] to god
[36:33] i don't know this uh
[36:35] race of lucifer is
[36:38] so awful
[36:39] how can you stand in front of god and
[36:42] tell god
[36:43] uh you know something like you're
[36:45] barking at the wrong tree
[36:48] you didn't give me cast custody of my
[36:51] brother and yet you come and ask me
[36:53] about my brother you working with the
[36:55] wrong tree
[37:00] what courage this
[37:02] this person has
[37:04] you
[37:06] know is gaslighting god saying that you
[37:10] came to looking for something where you
[37:13] you didn't leave it here
[37:17] it's demeaning
[37:21] it's self-absorbing
[37:25] it's all about cain
[37:29] cain can argue with god
[37:34] isn't it awful
[37:40] genesis 4
[37:41] let's continue we we just jump to verse
[37:44] 14.
[37:52] behold that has driven me out this day
[37:57] from the face of the earth
[37:59] and from thy face shall
[38:02] i be head and i shall be a fugitive and
[38:06] the vagabond in the earth
[38:08] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[38:11] that findeth me shall slay me
[38:15] and the lord say unto him
[38:17] therefore whosoever slayeth cain
[38:21] vengeance shall be taken on him
[38:23] sevenfold
[38:24] and the lord set
[38:26] a mark upon cain lest any finding
[38:30] him should kill him
[38:32] now
[38:33] notice that cain
[38:37] does not repent
[38:40] cain does not say i did
[38:42] there is no accountability
[38:45] there is no it doesn't take any
[38:47] responsibility
[38:49] probably say something like
[38:51] now that i'm accused of killing my
[38:54] brother
[38:57] now that i'm accused of killing my
[39:00] brother
[39:01] i need protection
[39:04] you never say
[39:06] i did
[39:08] i'm so sorry
[39:09] it's already done
[39:11] but you say
[39:13] now i am accused for
[39:16] killing my brother i need some
[39:17] protection and
[39:19] dramatize it dramatize a little bit and
[39:22] say god say to him
[39:24] my children i give them the best
[39:26] protection there is
[39:29] and that's the word
[39:30] the revelation of the word
[39:33] do you want me to give you the
[39:35] revelation of the word cain
[39:38] can say i don't want to hear about
[39:40] revelation
[39:44] give me a protection like a weaponry and
[39:48] you know
[39:49] thanks
[39:51] things like that
[39:54] god say
[39:55] the best protection
[39:57] is the word
[39:59] and church the best protection god gave
[40:02] us
[40:03] is his word
[40:04] that's why the devil attacked that word
[40:07] daily so we ca it can take it out of our
[40:11] heart
[40:13] best protection
[40:15] is revealed
[40:21] you say it doesn't like a revelation
[40:23] cain
[40:25] isn't the message works is faith
[40:28] expressed in 1965
[40:31] but abandoned is talking to
[40:33] a uh a minister talking to him about
[40:37] the trinity
[40:39] about
[40:41] god is only one god
[40:44] and but is in three functions
[40:47] father son and holy ghost
[40:49] and this man did not agree with brother
[40:52] branham
[40:54] and here is
[40:55] and works is faith expressed
[40:58] a baptist minister
[41:00] told me
[41:02] and not long ago you say i just can't
[41:05] accept
[41:06] revelation
[41:09] and i said then you cannot accept the
[41:11] bible you cannot accept christ because
[41:13] it's the revelation of god is god
[41:16] revealed in flesh
[41:19] therefore the whole church is built upon
[41:21] divine revelation
[41:25] are you with me church
[41:27] so
[41:28] yes
[41:30] the father did not accept the revelation
[41:33] the children did not accept the
[41:35] revelation
[41:39] but they want their own protection
[41:44] you see
[41:46] look at a strange situation that i have
[41:49] highlighted here
[41:51] cain has killed his brother
[41:54] cain has destroyed his relationship with
[41:57] god remember we talked about cain
[42:01] want to find favor with god right
[42:05] but he has destroyed his relationship
[42:08] with god but cain say is happy
[42:13] how do you know brother
[42:16] is his son we heard it
[42:20] is happy that god has given protection
[42:23] it will be veined 70 times
[42:26] you remember that
[42:28] so he's happy but he has killed his
[42:32] brother he has killed his brother if we
[42:35] bring it into today
[42:37] he has killed the influence of his
[42:41] brother
[42:46] his brother gift has been vindicated
[42:51] but the gift is for the whole body
[42:54] it could just say my gift has not been
[42:57] vindicated
[42:59] but my brother's gift
[43:02] god has approved it and we can see that
[43:05] god is using this man
[43:09] praise god because it's for the whole
[43:11] body
[43:13] right
[43:14] no he killed his brother influence
[43:17] showing to people not to have confidence
[43:21] in his brother
[43:24] not realizing that this is for the whole
[43:28] body of christ
[43:37] a
[43:38] gift is not for the person that has the
[43:42] gift
[43:43] it is for the whole body
[43:48] and into a gift that goes a lot of
[43:50] things
[43:53] they are scars and
[43:56] there is a lot of tears and pain
[43:59] in a gift
[44:01] ask a musician they will tell you
[44:04] that song that bless the people
[44:08] sometimes he's like i was in certain
[44:11] such situations such such pain and that
[44:14] song just
[44:15] sprung down
[44:21] and now when he's now uh
[44:25] uh god
[44:27] magnify that
[44:29] gift god show that gift to the people
[44:33] people don't know what goes into that
[44:38] and cain did not know
[44:40] but he killed the influence of his
[44:44] brother
[44:46] think about that you just say something
[44:49] to that sister who made it compose that
[44:51] song of that brother
[44:54] and just
[44:55] destroy him
[44:56] now they don't want to come up here and
[44:59] sing
[45:00] but the gift is for the whole
[45:02] body cain could just say well i don't
[45:06] have it but my brother has
[45:08] and brother but i'm saying that
[45:10] whoever has the ball
[45:13] we all go and protect it
[45:16] because it's for the team is more than
[45:18] for the team it is for the body
[45:21] it's even more than the body it is the
[45:24] kingdom
[45:27] amen
[45:34] amen
[45:36] am i too hard
[45:38] somebody has to say amen
[45:42] all right
[45:44] oh there's so much that goes into a
[45:46] ministry
[45:48] you know
[45:49] in
[45:50] a gift
[45:51] you know brother branham used to
[45:53] to say
[45:55] uh
[45:56] you know
[45:57] let me just say this there's a time
[46:00] where
[46:01] brother chad called me
[46:04] asking me if i can take the service
[46:07] and
[46:08] i look
[46:10] i was just crying
[46:12] a few minutes ago
[46:15] two three minutes five minutes i was
[46:17] crying
[46:21] honey
[46:22] look
[46:22] he just called me so
[46:24] god want me to be in this condition
[46:28] before you can use me
[46:30] when you feel like
[46:33] nothing or
[46:34] so your life is turning upside down so
[46:38] that's the time when he uses me
[46:41] not where i feel so like oh my
[46:44] i'm gonna go invade egypt
[46:48] so that's not the time
[46:51] i didn't tell him
[46:53] hey call me brother can you take it to
[46:55] service
[46:57] that's the way god
[46:58] does things
[47:01] when you feel your lowest
[47:03] that's when he can use you
[47:06] you know brother branham say god one day
[47:09] you know you read the message you listen
[47:11] to it but i'm saying god will change my
[47:14] ministry god will change my ministry
[47:16] it'll be something amazing i'm looking
[47:19] forward to it it is going to change my
[47:22] ministry oh my then one day he stopped
[47:26] and said god will not change my ministry
[47:29] it will change the minister
[47:33] because the ministry is always there it
[47:35] is a gift it's god but the men need to
[47:39] change
[47:42] a good disposition
[47:48] wow
[47:51] well let me keep going
[47:56] cane think is happy but cain is
[47:59] miserable
[48:01] now put two and two together
[48:04] kane is saying i'm happy i'm protected
[48:08] these relationships destroy
[48:11] oh
[48:12] i need nothing
[48:16] i'm so good oh my look at me
[48:20] [Laughter]
[48:26] but the bible says genesis chapter 3
[48:28] verse 17
[48:30] because thou sayest i'm rich and
[48:32] increase with good and have need of
[48:35] nothing noah's not down are rich and
[48:39] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[48:42] without protection
[48:45] naked
[48:47] without protection
[48:50] i counseled thee to buy of me gold
[48:53] trying fire the thou mice be rich and
[48:58] white
[48:59] raymond that thou might be clothed and
[49:02] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[49:05] appear and i know thy eyes with the eyes
[49:09] of that thou might see
[49:13] it doesn't know
[49:16] that is blind
[49:18] is miserable
[49:20] but you say i'm protected i'm okay
[49:24] what is this
[49:26] is it a mental situation
[49:29] or a spiritual condition
[49:32] could that be both
[49:35] but i'm going to use both right
[49:39] is it natural
[49:42] or is it spiritual could that be both
[49:48] you see the pastor has been preaching to
[49:50] us showing that when you go to work
[49:53] actually you are expressing christ
[49:56] is that right
[49:57] is it natural is it spiritual
[50:00] maybe it's blending in time
[50:03] what you do
[50:05] is
[50:06] natural it's spiritual yeah
[50:10] when i was much much younger i listened
[50:12] to brother when i'm talking about maybe
[50:14] adoption
[50:16] he said god may call you to be
[50:19] a housewife
[50:21] in the body eat the body doesn't make
[50:24] sense
[50:26] god can call you to be
[50:29] a person that makes chairs really
[50:33] i thought in the body there are nine
[50:36] gifts
[50:39] five
[50:40] ministry
[50:42] you know
[50:43] but whatever i'm saying even making
[50:46] chairs is in the body
[50:48] function it just makes it does make
[50:51] sense now
[50:57] as you're living your life
[51:01] that's how god is being manifested
[51:05] his
[51:06] gift is just you expressing christ's
[51:10] mind to the world
[51:13] and therefore cain what is doing
[51:17] is display a different attribute
[51:20] and god is calling us this morning not
[51:23] to do that
[51:25] but he's not giving us a code of conduct
[51:30] is that right
[51:32] it's not giving us a code of conduct how
[51:34] to behave well
[51:38] is saying
[51:40] let the mind get in
[51:42] let the word in let the word in every
[51:46] day the darkness will be cast out
[51:59] i'm gonna take a lot of
[52:03] angle so bear with me
[52:08] cain's condition
[52:12] can
[52:13] luck
[52:14] lack empathy it doesn't
[52:16] it doesn't care that god is crying
[52:19] forever doesn't care
[52:23] cain is
[52:25] validation seeking
[52:27] is untitled
[52:29] it's
[52:30] always about gain
[52:32] it's condescending
[52:36] it's trying to change
[52:38] god's reality and say hey
[52:42] how can you come and look for evil here
[52:48] it's manipulative
[52:51] because we're telling god that oh you
[52:53] didn't give me custody yet you come
[52:56] asking for able here
[53:05] cane condition
[53:08] is demeaning
[53:11] cain cannot handle disappointment
[53:15] it's too much for him
[53:20] but in your disappointment you keep
[53:23] worshipping him
[53:25] you know
[53:26] you keep serving him
[53:32] cane
[53:33] atmosphere the atmosphere that cain
[53:37] produces
[53:39] causes a high level of stress
[53:43] people have to walk on eggshells
[53:46] cane is argumentative
[53:49] you did not give me custody and now you
[53:55] cain has a frightening rage
[54:00] i bring it to the natural
[54:04] could that be spiritual too
[54:08] well is expressing something else
[54:11] it's spiritual
[54:14] because those are not in the mind of
[54:16] christ
[54:18] christ
[54:21] gave life
[54:23] cain
[54:24] took life
[54:26] christ obey until death
[54:29] king cannot obey to
[54:31] love things such as just give
[54:35] this
[54:36] sacrifice and that will be over
[54:41] can live for cain cain worship king
[54:48] but jesus said i sanctify myself for
[54:50] others
[54:52] and he said eternal life is to live for
[54:55] others
[55:01] but look at all
[55:03] this condition
[55:09] the list is long you can find yours
[55:14] canes is unpredictable
[55:18] you don't know what can trigger a
[55:21] central monkey
[55:23] a big drama
[55:27] it doesn't take responsibility
[55:30] it has tendency of blaming somebody else
[55:36] he hates feedback don't tell me that my
[55:40] gift is not good
[55:46] enough but cain say there is nothing
[55:49] wrong with him
[55:51] he's doing well
[55:54] he's doing well
[55:58] yeah church i can see you
[56:00] you're quiet it's painful
[56:05] but this
[56:07] spirit
[56:09] works today
[56:14] it's so strange
[56:16] that uh
[56:18] the statistics say 10 to 15
[56:22] of people have that
[56:27] and in some area it can be
[56:29] 50 percent
[56:31] with this how can you display christ
[56:38] it's impossible to display christ with
[56:41] all that listen the neighbors seen this
[56:45] how the neighbor will see christ oh i
[56:47] believe the message i i we go to church
[56:50] our past is wonderful yes which is true
[56:52] but
[56:55] christ is not expressed
[57:07] i'm painting a bad picture
[57:10] i am
[57:11] not
[57:12] mocking or making fun
[57:15] of
[57:18] anybody in the world that has this
[57:21] no i'm painting a bad picture i'm
[57:24] dramatizing you can see maybe i am a
[57:26] picture person
[57:28] i like the big picture
[57:32] all right
[57:36] let me ask a question i wrote here can a
[57:39] person display such behavior be a
[57:42] christian
[57:45] now i don't want to use my intelligence
[57:50] to answer that question
[57:52] all right
[57:53] i don't want to do that
[57:56] i want to go by the word
[57:58] and looking at the word i will say this
[58:01] person
[58:05] is not yet converted
[58:08] the love of god
[58:10] but they are not converted yet
[58:13] our prayer you and i
[58:16] is god
[58:19] to
[58:20] generate conversions
[58:24] because we have a lot of uh
[58:27] confessions or decisions
[58:32] but now we need conversion
[58:35] because the decision is good only when
[58:37] god takes it to the goddess
[58:42] he need revelation
[58:44] then that decision will be good
[58:47] but we have so many decisions i would
[58:49] lord i will do this i will serve you but
[58:51] this is not conversion it's all
[58:55] intellectual if you can pray for the
[58:58] body of christ ask god to send more
[59:02] conversion
[59:04] remember peter cast out devils and
[59:08] perform miracles but yet christ told him
[59:12] you are not converted yet
[59:16] so therefore my brother would display
[59:18] this
[59:20] is in his way to conversion
[59:23] he needs somebody to believe with him
[59:26] somebody to pray for him that god
[59:29] changed this intellectual cane
[59:32] conversion
[59:33] into a revelation personal revelation
[59:46] now
[59:47] i almost gave it the answer to another
[59:50] question
[59:52] after you saw the list that i had here
[59:56] if you ask a science
[59:58] because what i'm saying science will
[1:00:00] find god before you
[1:00:02] he was not talking to us
[1:00:07] but they won't do anything with it
[1:00:10] science can find the dna of jesus
[1:00:13] i'm telling you they can't
[1:00:15] if the words keep going they can
[1:00:19] build some tools that can find dna
[1:00:22] but they won't do anything
[1:00:24] they can have the blood of jesus
[1:00:27] he won't do any good
[1:00:29] science saw the cloud
[1:00:34] science saw the pillar of fire
[1:00:37] they didn't do anything
[1:00:39] right but they can find it
[1:00:43] when you ask them those
[1:00:45] psychologists and psychiatrists
[1:00:49] they will say what you have told us
[1:00:52] about cain if if a person who has those
[1:00:56] type of traits
[1:00:58] exist
[1:00:59] then that person has what is called
[1:01:01] narcissistic
[1:01:03] personality
[1:01:05] right there they would just say oh
[1:01:07] that's it
[1:01:08] that's it
[1:01:10] i said to you bear with me
[1:01:16] now
[1:01:17] there is something that is called a
[1:01:20] dsm-5
[1:01:22] where all i'm not expert
[1:01:28] all the
[1:01:30] uh
[1:01:31] mental sickness
[1:01:33] there about 200 of them
[1:01:35] they go in this dsm-5
[1:01:40] but when it came to this narcissistic
[1:01:43] personality
[1:01:45] psychologists psychiatrists
[1:01:49] were not too sure
[1:01:51] to put it in
[1:01:54] it was like
[1:01:56] can this be a sickness
[1:01:59] they say yes
[1:02:01] no
[1:02:03] yes
[1:02:04] reluctantly
[1:02:07] they say yeah let's put it as
[1:02:11] a mental sickness
[1:02:14] why because
[1:02:15] actually the doctor's duty is to try to
[1:02:18] ease pain
[1:02:20] is that right
[1:02:22] but this person has no pain is fully
[1:02:25] functioning
[1:02:28] the pain is inflicted to people around
[1:02:32] them
[1:02:34] therefore how can you say it needs help
[1:02:38] actually when they go to get help it's
[1:02:41] usually because they're in trouble with
[1:02:43] the law or something like that and they
[1:02:46] will drop out of that uh session with
[1:02:49] the therapist they actually will will uh
[1:02:52] charm the therapists
[1:02:55] and they will actually
[1:02:57] accuse other around them that
[1:03:00] they the one that has the sickness not
[1:03:03] themselves
[1:03:05] and they're happy
[1:03:07] only the people around them are
[1:03:09] miserable able is you know
[1:03:12] able can see
[1:03:14] the the consequence of the tantrum
[1:03:21] but cain is fine as long as i'm think
[1:03:23] seven times i'm okay
[1:03:27] and but they know that this person is
[1:03:30] sick
[1:03:31] but it's a fully functioning it's not
[1:03:33] like alzheimer's
[1:03:37] but they fully function at the reason
[1:03:40] they do everything but just the
[1:03:42] atmosphere around them is toxic
[1:03:48] and then they decided no no we're gonna
[1:03:50] ah we we're just going to to keep it as
[1:03:53] a dsm-5
[1:03:56] we do we do have
[1:04:03] now in a message i read this before long
[1:04:06] time
[1:04:08] 1962
[1:04:10] letting off the pressure
[1:04:12] see
[1:04:13] it's just a built-up pressure it's the
[1:04:16] age that we are living in in neurotic
[1:04:19] age where people don't know what to do
[1:04:22] where they where they are going and the
[1:04:24] doctor don't have the answer for it
[1:04:27] because the psychiatrist is being
[1:04:30] doctorate by the psychiatrist so they
[1:04:33] have not
[1:04:35] the
[1:04:36] answer
[1:04:38] well it's so good they don't have the
[1:04:40] answer because the answer is in the word
[1:04:44] of god
[1:04:52] a young sister is a newcomer sister work
[1:04:55] went to branham tabernacle and another
[1:04:58] sister of a different church was trying
[1:05:01] to show this uh newcomer
[1:05:04] that brother branham was not spiritual
[1:05:06] enough you got to understand this is a
[1:05:09] time where you know a pentecostal
[1:05:12] movement a lot of people can could pray
[1:05:14] for the sick miracles everywhere because
[1:05:18] god has us as told brother branham to
[1:05:21] bring to the world the gift of healing
[1:05:24] so he went everywhere
[1:05:27] now this is a conversation taking side
[1:05:29] with jesus
[1:05:31] here not long ago a certain sister that
[1:05:34] goes to this church was at another
[1:05:36] church where god was making everything
[1:05:39] happen
[1:05:40] and this church this sister say to the
[1:05:43] other sisters say you know
[1:05:45] that man that could pray for the sick
[1:05:47] say must have a very victorious life and
[1:05:50] say
[1:05:51] he must just be able his family and
[1:05:53] everything be healed at uh
[1:05:56] it's not
[1:05:58] for finger if but branham was spiritual
[1:06:01] enough he could when his children his
[1:06:04] wife is sick you could just say
[1:06:06] healing
[1:06:10] that's the critics
[1:06:12] now whatever i'm saying that um the same
[1:06:15] thing so that
[1:06:17] that is you see just trying to find
[1:06:19] something she was just trying to find
[1:06:21] something to this young convert to
[1:06:24] blight their name the name of the works
[1:06:27] of god see they wanted to blight it
[1:06:29] every time a child gets sick one of his
[1:06:33] children he takes them to a doctor you
[1:06:36] know what brother when i bring these
[1:06:38] children to the doctor
[1:06:44] sure i would then
[1:06:46] if the doctor can't i will ask god to
[1:06:49] help before i go there
[1:06:53] then if the doctor can do nothing about
[1:06:55] it then i will take him up a little
[1:06:58] higher
[1:07:00] huh that's right yes sir it's just the
[1:07:03] same today they are trying to find a
[1:07:05] trap somewhere
[1:07:07] i took this because
[1:07:10] if the doctors the psychiatrists the
[1:07:13] psychologist say this is not something
[1:07:16] that can be healed
[1:07:18] we don't even want to put it in a book
[1:07:21] well let's just put it
[1:07:24] so it means they
[1:07:26] can
[1:07:27] then we need to bring the better a
[1:07:30] little higher
[1:07:31] if you know anybody
[1:07:33] it's your duty
[1:07:35] as representing the
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:38] christ in this world
[1:07:41] when everybody says impossible
[1:07:44] this person by god grace
[1:07:46] can
[1:07:47] heal
[1:07:48] and express christ's mind than the mind
[1:07:53] of the world
[1:07:57] it is a challenge to god
[1:08:00] but god says somebody has to pray
[1:08:03] somebody has to believe
[1:08:08] i used to tell people somebody has to
[1:08:11] pray and i didn't have much argument
[1:08:14] i said somebody has to pray i used to
[1:08:16] tell them that even the coming of
[1:08:19] brother branham somebody had to pray
[1:08:22] and somebody people were in prayer then
[1:08:25] god gave a prophecy i will send william
[1:08:28] branham
[1:08:31] somebody has to pray now that uh brother
[1:08:34] chad
[1:08:35] get into the deep of that word and say
[1:08:39] things
[1:08:41] are directed from the earth that's my
[1:08:44] own words
[1:08:45] by the way
[1:08:47] it starts here even the redemption is
[1:08:50] here the bride is here the bridegroom is
[1:08:54] here the headquarters down now it seems
[1:08:58] to be here
[1:09:01] the cleansing of
[1:09:03] earth and heaven
[1:09:05] here
[1:09:09] and somebody has to pray about it
[1:09:12] if science say we don't know what to do
[1:09:17] that's good
[1:09:21] you go higher
[1:09:24] the principles of divine healing
[1:09:28] 1961 the principle of divine healing now
[1:09:32] the first thing a person does when they
[1:09:34] get sick maybe around home
[1:09:37] you have a few remedies and things you
[1:09:39] try the next thing is maybe you call the
[1:09:41] doctor that sensible thing to do if the
[1:09:45] doctor can do no good then you got a
[1:09:48] right to go
[1:09:50] to god
[1:09:52] that's what you should do call on god
[1:09:54] and god is the order of circumstance
[1:09:57] he can do when nothing else can do when
[1:10:00] man comes to the end of the line
[1:10:03] god can do
[1:10:06] psalm 103
[1:10:10] bless the lord all my soul and all that
[1:10:12] is within me bless his
[1:10:14] holy name bless the lord of my soul and
[1:10:18] for get not all his benefit who forgive
[1:10:22] us all thine iniquities who healeth all
[1:10:26] thy disease
[1:10:29] amen
[1:10:33] science has a limit
[1:10:34] doctors have limit
[1:10:36] god has no limit
[1:10:39] he is the lord who heals all sickness
[1:10:42] physical mental spiritual
[1:10:46] is the lord who heal the body the spirit
[1:10:50] the soul
[1:10:52] bring that matter
[1:10:55] higher
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:59] i want to take a little
[1:11:01] how they say
[1:11:03] digress a little bit
[1:11:05] but uh
[1:11:10] maybe
[1:11:11] it will make sense
[1:11:14] uh
[1:11:16] you see the angel
[1:11:18] say to brother branham
[1:11:22] if you are sincere when you pray
[1:11:25] and get the people to believe you
[1:11:27] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:11:30] not even cancer is that right
[1:11:38] so you see
[1:11:41] when i look at it i don't know if you
[1:11:44] bother him talks about a lot i never i
[1:11:47] don't know if you made a connection
[1:11:50] but if you look at the
[1:11:52] the first bible
[1:11:54] of god is this zodiac
[1:11:57] hopefully this
[1:11:59] is clear to you you will see that
[1:12:01] the first sign of the zodiac
[1:12:04] when i look at the newspapers usually
[1:12:07] they put it like harris
[1:12:10] and then the last one
[1:12:12] they put it like
[1:12:14] sagittarius
[1:12:16] but brother branham when
[1:12:18] he look at this
[1:12:19] zodiac you say the first sign is
[1:12:22] actually
[1:12:24] the virgo
[1:12:26] the coming of the lord
[1:12:29] in the virgin is that right
[1:12:32] then he said the last sign
[1:12:36] is
[1:12:36] the leo the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:43] and he say look if you look at that you
[1:12:46] will see that if you do viggo being the
[1:12:49] first you have to go round and round to
[1:12:53] get to leo
[1:12:54] is that right
[1:12:56] but he said before you get to leo you
[1:12:58] will pass through the
[1:13:00] cancer
[1:13:02] age
[1:13:04] now brother branham say the angel told
[1:13:07] him
[1:13:09] no
[1:13:10] disease will stand
[1:13:13] even cancer
[1:13:16] cancer is announced in heaven before he
[1:13:19] get to earth
[1:13:21] and god said to him even cancer will not
[1:13:24] stand
[1:13:28] are you with him
[1:13:30] and he said we are
[1:13:32] in the age of cancer and barabaram says
[1:13:35] that
[1:13:37] the in this super exhortation of divine
[1:13:40] healing he said the supernatural being
[1:13:43] that spoke to me said that talking
[1:13:46] about praying for the sick he specified
[1:13:49] one disease he said not even to cancer
[1:13:52] shall stand before the prayer there has
[1:13:55] been more cancers healed than anything
[1:13:58] else
[1:14:01] so god announces in heaven on earth
[1:14:04] cancer is coming he sends his prophet
[1:14:07] and the prophet pray
[1:14:09] more cancers than anything
[1:14:12] are healed
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:16] praise god for that
[1:14:19] but now
[1:14:20] what happened in 1963 the souls that are
[1:14:23] in prison now
[1:14:27] everybody say could i vision when i was
[1:14:29] a little boy is the the hour is the time
[1:14:33] when them weary looking gloomy hell
[1:14:36] being created right here on earth
[1:14:41] hell
[1:14:42] on earth
[1:14:45] are you with me
[1:14:47] so that i in prison now i plead
[1:14:50] that
[1:14:52] with all my heart as we see not only
[1:14:54] somebody talking but the scripture
[1:14:57] itself bringing us to the this hour and
[1:15:01] that vision of a little boy
[1:15:04] seeing those people in that condition
[1:15:06] that was brother brennaman 14 years old
[1:15:09] when he was losing blood
[1:15:11] and now think the hell the thing that is
[1:15:15] so in hell he saw it
[1:15:17] in jcpenney
[1:15:21] the hell itself mercy has been blown out
[1:15:24] from the earth and now hell itself is
[1:15:27] here and the people lord are in hideous
[1:15:32] condition
[1:15:36] hell
[1:15:38] change the dimension come here
[1:15:42] are you with me
[1:15:44] it brought with all the demons to
[1:15:46] determine to put pressure on you
[1:15:50] to bring dog that mental condition
[1:15:54] that the doctors don't understand
[1:15:59] hell
[1:16:00] on the surface
[1:16:02] dimensions are now blending in
[1:16:08] now
[1:16:10] the same year 1963
[1:16:12] they hear that verb so hell on earth
[1:16:16] he also see
[1:16:19] christ the head the lion the judge
[1:16:23] coming from heaven
[1:16:25] the head is coming down
[1:16:29] heaven is coming down hell is going
[1:16:34] and they're all together here
[1:16:37] what that cause
[1:16:39] distress among the nations
[1:16:42] perplexity of time
[1:16:47] up to the bride
[1:16:49] because the king has come the
[1:16:52] judge is here
[1:16:54] to claim
[1:16:56] to claim the bride is that right
[1:16:59] therefore there is no sickness that can
[1:17:02] stand
[1:17:04] i'm telling you the first pull was great
[1:17:06] it was good
[1:17:08] the second pull was great
[1:17:11] but nothing compared with the opening of
[1:17:14] the world
[1:17:15] brother bradham is not here to show the
[1:17:18] poor one
[1:17:19] first of all second paul but the world
[1:17:22] is in his people
[1:17:24] it's not the public display but yet the
[1:17:28] world is here
[1:17:31] doctors can say anything they want
[1:17:33] but if you want to open that door
[1:17:37] christ is more than able to change to
[1:17:40] transform
[1:17:42] to
[1:17:42] renew to make your son dory god
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] oh
[1:17:51] i don't even know
[1:17:53] because
[1:17:54] it's not blurry
[1:17:56] where are we now
[1:17:58] are we in the case
[1:18:00] cancer age
[1:18:03] but the lion is here
[1:18:06] why is that cancer
[1:18:08] or leo
[1:18:11] what about both
[1:18:13] i don't know that's me that's me
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] well luke 21
[1:18:22] 25
[1:18:23] and there shall be sign in the sun in
[1:18:26] the moon in the stars and upon the earth
[1:18:28] distress of nations with perplexity the
[1:18:32] sea and the waves roaring
[1:18:34] men's heart failing them for fear and
[1:18:37] for looking after those things which are
[1:18:40] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:18:43] heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[1:18:46] they see the son of man coming in a
[1:18:48] cloud with power and great glory
[1:18:54] oh my
[1:18:56] demons on earth
[1:18:58] 200 cents against the bride
[1:19:01] 200 million
[1:19:04] right
[1:19:07] against the bride
[1:19:09] oh my
[1:19:10] perplexity of time
[1:19:16] but nation see
[1:19:22] nation
[1:19:24] nation sees
[1:19:25] the coming of the lord in a cloud
[1:19:28] they should be afraid
[1:19:30] but the bride should have peace
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:34] no more fear
[1:19:36] no more anxiety
[1:19:38] no more of those things
[1:19:41] it's a neurotic age but we are going to
[1:19:44] the age of leo
[1:19:46] praise god
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:49] it's you god chose you yeah yeah me too
[1:19:53] i feel like you feel
[1:19:55] nobody
[1:19:56] but god say you
[1:19:58] yes he will express the mind of christ
[1:20:01] in you
[1:20:02] yes
[1:20:13] let me say this beside
[1:20:16] cancer
[1:20:18] what are the sickness you saw in the
[1:20:20] prayer line
[1:20:24] i did not do statistics
[1:20:27] but i will tell you it is about
[1:20:33] nervousness
[1:20:36] sister you are nervous
[1:20:38] you see people things are like gloomy
[1:20:40] and
[1:20:42] brother you are just nervous
[1:20:44] how many times you heard it
[1:20:47] well
[1:20:48] it makes sense when god shows something
[1:20:51] in heaven
[1:20:53] before before it happened on earth
[1:20:56] he shows it first in heaven
[1:20:59] distress
[1:21:00] perplexity of time
[1:21:02] hell on earth
[1:21:04] heaven came down
[1:21:07] and that that's why we feel that
[1:21:09] pressure if you don't feel that pressure
[1:21:11] you must feel that pressure you are a
[1:21:13] christian you should you should feel
[1:21:14] that pressure but that pressure is
[1:21:17] different from person to person family
[1:21:19] to family
[1:21:22] all kind of things are happening right
[1:21:24] now and its purpose is to stop
[1:21:28] the
[1:21:29] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:21:32] god right now
[1:21:34] but the devil is defeated
[1:21:39] amen
[1:21:41] shalom
[1:21:43] to the bride
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:53] this is what the prophet said in the
[1:21:55] comforter
[1:21:56] 1561
[1:21:58] let us go back just a few minutes
[1:22:02] and find those men who kept god's great
[1:22:05] sacred trust
[1:22:07] that that
[1:22:08] was his word now
[1:22:11] that's what we inherited is the word and
[1:22:15] in the time of strain in a time of
[1:22:18] perplexity in the time of distress in
[1:22:21] the time of perilous times they found
[1:22:25] comfort in keeping the world
[1:22:29] the world
[1:22:30] is god's comfort
[1:22:32] you want to be comfort
[1:22:34] the world when you know and can walk
[1:22:37] down even to the valley of the shadow of
[1:22:40] death
[1:22:41] and know that god says so that sets it
[1:22:44] god said so
[1:22:47] amen
[1:22:49] amen amen
[1:22:52] now
[1:22:53] in the bible we are living that adoption
[1:22:55] number two in uh
[1:22:58] 1960 and and in the bible where we're
[1:23:01] living in the last day the top of the
[1:23:04] pyramid the cross fishes which is the
[1:23:07] cancer age
[1:23:08] of the cancer age in the zodiac in the
[1:23:12] time of the coming of the leo the lion
[1:23:16] in the crapping stone that's where we
[1:23:20] live again
[1:23:21] so it's not wrong
[1:23:24] in the time of the coming of leo the
[1:23:27] lion in the clapping stone and in the
[1:23:30] days of the manifestations
[1:23:33] of the sons of god in the bible see
[1:23:36] where are we at
[1:23:38] we are right at the end where are you
[1:23:41] cancer age or leo
[1:23:45] in between
[1:23:47] we it's later than we think
[1:23:53] that's why all these demons are coming
[1:23:55] quickly because they know he's later
[1:23:57] than we say
[1:23:58] and god rely on somebody like me i
[1:24:01] shouldn't feel good about it
[1:24:03] not okay usually we just feel like we
[1:24:06] we don't measure up
[1:24:09] but he's saying
[1:24:11] just say amen to it
[1:24:13] he will do it
[1:24:14] it will make provision
[1:24:17] it's not about me
[1:24:19] it's about him
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:28] yes the coming of the world
[1:24:30] is greater than any other pose
[1:24:34] let's bring him
[1:24:36] bring it
[1:24:38] higher
[1:24:39] yeah the situation is too bad sometimes
[1:24:44] that condition i described to you
[1:24:47] is the nature of cain
[1:24:51] but we cannot just say nature of cain
[1:24:53] because we have been made hybrid
[1:24:57] the way we came in this world was not
[1:24:59] god's plan
[1:25:02] is that right
[1:25:04] so we came in hybrid way so we can
[1:25:07] manifest some of the things
[1:25:10] even worse some of all kind of things
[1:25:14] but if we let the word of god come
[1:25:20] then the
[1:25:22] darkness will be cast out
[1:25:25] you see the bible say that the i
[1:25:29] is the light
[1:25:32] of the body
[1:25:35] the prophet is the eye
[1:25:38] of the body
[1:25:40] and the body when it's single is good
[1:25:44] it sends the light to the rest of the
[1:25:47] body
[1:25:49] the whole being
[1:25:51] has a light
[1:25:54] the revelation in you
[1:25:58] is the light
[1:26:00] that goes into all the regions
[1:26:04] of your being
[1:26:06] i'm trying just to say it i'm trying
[1:26:09] just to avoid to say
[1:26:11] all the rooms of your house
[1:26:14] i'm creating new vocabularies
[1:26:18] maybe you will pay attention
[1:26:24] the light goes into the region
[1:26:27] like the in the matthew they say galilee
[1:26:30] of the gentiles
[1:26:33] people that were living in a darkness a
[1:26:35] great light has shined
[1:26:38] that's you in it in me
[1:26:41] the light of shining a darkness
[1:26:45] gentiles
[1:26:46] stand up
[1:26:48] and shalom to the bride
[1:26:53] if i
[1:26:54] if my life has been contaminated by this
[1:26:58] spirit that's not me that's not you
[1:27:03] you gotta just shut down that door open
[1:27:06] to the mind of christ his word
[1:27:11] because how can you display christ like
[1:27:14] brother ron was saying the other time
[1:27:17] say he read psalm 69 i am hindering the
[1:27:22] works of god
[1:27:24] yeah
[1:27:26] you don't want to hinder it
[1:27:28] you actually want to display christ
[1:27:31] to the dying world
[1:27:38] but
[1:27:39] what happened is
[1:27:41] with this spirit
[1:27:42] i'm gonna just put that
[1:27:44] list here just a small list
[1:27:47] people
[1:27:48] living under
[1:27:51] that cane spirit
[1:27:54] under that atmosphere they show
[1:27:58] signs they suffer anxiety i'm not saying
[1:28:01] all anxiety comes from a bad atmosphere
[1:28:03] you understand i cannot keep cl
[1:28:06] disclaiming disclaiming
[1:28:09] i won't finish what i'm talking about
[1:28:11] but you are spiritual people you have
[1:28:13] filters
[1:28:15] yeah
[1:28:16] so people that are living under a
[1:28:19] condition like that
[1:28:21] they suffer
[1:28:23] anxiety depression ptsd post traumatic
[1:28:28] stress disorder what the
[1:28:31] the uh
[1:28:33] our uh
[1:28:35] army servicemen
[1:28:37] that's what they suffer
[1:28:38] you know after seeing all these
[1:28:40] atrocities they come home
[1:28:43] they have this ptsd
[1:28:46] like
[1:28:46] doctors say people under narcissistic
[1:28:50] uh personality influence
[1:28:53] they live and
[1:28:54] anxiety depression pst
[1:28:57] complexes and
[1:28:59] it's painful
[1:29:02] sometimes the suspicious they isolate
[1:29:04] themselves
[1:29:06] the second guessing everything they do
[1:29:09] sometimes they can't even marry the the
[1:29:11] person that looks like the one that was
[1:29:14] narcissistic in their life because they
[1:29:17] trying to
[1:29:19] get them approved
[1:29:21] and they ended up burying that person
[1:29:26] you and the person both the person of
[1:29:30] narcissistic and the person that goes
[1:29:33] through that they both did not do
[1:29:36] anything they did not look for it
[1:29:39] let's make it clear
[1:29:42] a narcissist cannot say i'm going to be
[1:29:44] narcissistic
[1:29:47] the person that
[1:29:49] under that influence don't say i want to
[1:29:51] be under that influence
[1:29:53] atmosphere
[1:29:55] so if you go through this anxiety
[1:29:58] depression and everything you just need
[1:30:01] to claim
[1:30:03] you have to claim your right in the name
[1:30:06] of the lord jesus because you must
[1:30:08] display christ and the complexes will
[1:30:12] not get you too far
[1:30:15] very far with god we know the scriptures
[1:30:18] we know the coach
[1:30:22] you didn't look for it
[1:30:26] but you can get rid of it
[1:30:29] we've got help
[1:30:31] with his word
[1:30:34] what do you do again i'm not saying i'm
[1:30:37] going to give you a code of conduct
[1:30:41] it's just like brother ben
[1:30:43] ben cebu
[1:30:44] was saying that if you fend for yourself
[1:30:48] you will produce a cane you keep
[1:30:51] repeating that
[1:30:52] you keep repeating that
[1:30:54] if you fend for yourself
[1:30:56] i'm going to do this i'm going to be a
[1:30:58] good boy yeah that's good but that
[1:31:00] doesn't help
[1:31:02] what you need is let the word
[1:31:06] let the word means i don't resist the
[1:31:10] word
[1:31:11] i say amen to the word and the work that
[1:31:14] the world will do
[1:31:18] it's hard to say what he's going to do
[1:31:23] he has the power to cast out any kind of
[1:31:26] demon
[1:31:28] yes
[1:31:34] 55 the way to have fellowship
[1:31:44] let me
[1:31:45] you know pause a little bit here and say
[1:31:48] uh if somebody said brother
[1:31:51] were you preaching psychology
[1:31:55] no
[1:31:56] no i'm preaching the word
[1:31:59] i will prove it to you
[1:32:04] actually uh
[1:32:05] i don't know psychology to tell you i i
[1:32:08] one time i was taking some computer
[1:32:10] science things and they asked me to take
[1:32:13] a class of psychology or you know human
[1:32:17] elective you know human
[1:32:20] human science as an elective
[1:32:24] maybe i took economy and
[1:32:26] introduction to psychology
[1:32:29] and i don't remember i don't remember
[1:32:32] we're front love and whatever i don't i
[1:32:34] don't even know
[1:32:36] and the wonderful
[1:32:38] lady that was teaching us
[1:32:40] she uh every time she came to the class
[1:32:44] it was just like she's uh
[1:32:47] she's mocking christians
[1:32:50] to me
[1:32:52] yeah she would just say something like
[1:32:54] we imagined things and
[1:32:57] you know
[1:32:58] then one day she came in class and she
[1:33:01] said
[1:33:02] um there is something that science does
[1:33:04] not understand
[1:33:08] you turn out the people that are always
[1:33:11] a negative
[1:33:15] they develop sickness like cancer
[1:33:18] diabetics
[1:33:19] science doesn't know
[1:33:21] the correlation
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:27] it's in the word
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:31] the atmosphere is favorable
[1:33:34] to demons
[1:33:36] it's not every diabetic or cancer
[1:33:39] whatever you have comes from a negative
[1:33:42] thought disclaimer
[1:33:48] but science doesn't know for people that
[1:33:51] have those negatives
[1:33:56] so
[1:33:57] let's listen to the prophet now
[1:34:00] in 1955
[1:34:03] he preached a message called
[1:34:06] the way
[1:34:08] to have fellowship
[1:34:10] 1955
[1:34:12] what brought on juvenile delinquency was
[1:34:15] parent delinquency
[1:34:17] the parent failing to take care of the
[1:34:19] children
[1:34:20] you remember a few years ago when my boy
[1:34:23] was born there has been about i think
[1:34:26] he's about 19 now
[1:34:30] i remember the doctor told my wife faye
[1:34:33] just let that kid
[1:34:36] and say it ain't going to hurt him
[1:34:40] and if a grandma comes along to pick him
[1:34:43] up and say take her take her keep her
[1:34:46] hands off of him
[1:34:50] and say he ought to be broken at
[1:34:53] six months old
[1:34:55] and now you better you know better than
[1:34:57] that sounds like a talking of a witch
[1:35:00] dog doctor instead of a real doctor
[1:35:04] and then you know what it out out
[1:35:08] hatch out
[1:35:09] so probably saying that a doctor may be
[1:35:12] a psychologist
[1:35:14] say to them
[1:35:15] when you get your kid
[1:35:17] leave them today they say even
[1:35:20] leave them put them in a different room
[1:35:23] let them cry all night
[1:35:26] if they don't have fever there is okay
[1:35:29] but i'm saying that which craft that
[1:35:32] kind of psychology is witchcraft
[1:35:39] it ouch out a bunch of neurotic
[1:35:43] and a bunch of gangsters
[1:35:46] listen god gave you that baby to love i
[1:35:49] don't care how bad you spoil it love it
[1:35:52] anyhow that's right love it if you don't
[1:35:55] love it now it will grow up in a cold
[1:35:58] home and and different it to it will
[1:36:01] seek love somewhere or something
[1:36:06] i put something
[1:36:08] in highlight
[1:36:10] can be anything
[1:36:12] it will make an outline
[1:36:15] for somewhere mother take thy baby and
[1:36:18] give it the fellowship and love now make
[1:36:21] it a part of you which it is and act
[1:36:24] like it
[1:36:30] and
[1:36:31] hug it and kiss it
[1:36:33] and love it
[1:36:37] don't be too cold with the things of the
[1:36:39] world god gave you that as a treasure
[1:36:43] raise it right
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:47] notice that
[1:36:48] uh that's what's the matter
[1:36:51] we got away from the things of god
[1:36:54] you get away from nature then you out of
[1:36:58] the will of god
[1:37:00] so it's not psychology
[1:37:03] it's the nature the first bible of god
[1:37:07] nature
[1:37:09] pick up that baby
[1:37:11] when
[1:37:12] it's crying
[1:37:18] are you to sing some for them
[1:37:22] i was not a good singer but it worked
[1:37:30] ah
[1:37:33] and i didn't know i didn't read this it
[1:37:35] was just nature
[1:37:39] nature not psychology
[1:37:41] this child
[1:37:43] that was left crying that child will
[1:37:46] experience what is called abandonment
[1:37:50] and narcissism
[1:37:53] narcissism
[1:37:54] is they say it comes from it
[1:37:58] feeling abandoned then the child wants
[1:38:02] to fend for themself when they grow up
[1:38:06] is a defense mechanism this is where
[1:38:09] brother uh i say it again but a ben was
[1:38:12] saying you fend for yourself you will
[1:38:14] produce cain
[1:38:16] he didn't know what he was talking about
[1:38:19] he was giving me my message
[1:38:23] something
[1:38:25] it's an abandonment so they fend for
[1:38:27] themselves is the protection mechanism
[1:38:30] that's why they do all the things on
[1:38:32] people they create a toxic environment
[1:38:35] because they feel abandoned
[1:38:40] and this is not psychology this is by
[1:38:42] the brand seventh grade student
[1:38:46] right
[1:38:54] early spiritual experience
[1:38:58] 1952 i lost my my first wife and been
[1:39:02] married and lived single for five years
[1:39:04] and then my
[1:39:06] little boy
[1:39:08] was going to school
[1:39:10] and what caused me to ever to think of
[1:39:14] getting married again
[1:39:15] she made me promise when she was dying
[1:39:18] that i would not live single
[1:39:22] i
[1:39:22] uh
[1:39:24] i said billy
[1:39:26] come go home with me
[1:39:28] i was living on a boat on the river
[1:39:31] camping
[1:39:32] i couldn't stay home home wasn't home to
[1:39:35] me no more
[1:39:37] down with my
[1:39:38] mother that is gone and and with my
[1:39:42] mother-in-law and i just could not stay
[1:39:45] nowhere and some people kept billy and i
[1:39:48] went over and he was playing in his
[1:39:51] little sand pile i said billy you want
[1:39:54] to go home with daddy
[1:39:59] he turned and looked at me he say his
[1:40:02] little eyes
[1:40:04] and
[1:40:05] all eyes and say daddy where is my home
[1:40:11] church is six years old even if the
[1:40:14] garage is way you spend the night at
[1:40:17] home
[1:40:19] you will not ask daddy where is my home
[1:40:22] this child spoke like the mule
[1:40:25] the mew
[1:40:27] because brother branham had all these
[1:40:30] scars with him all this disappointment
[1:40:33] with life when god took his wife
[1:40:37] now he wants to pass it down without
[1:40:41] knowing is passing down to the next
[1:40:44] generation
[1:40:46] he doesn't want to get married and moved
[1:40:49] the kid from place to place
[1:40:53] and he is he had no home to go i didn't
[1:40:57] answer him i chalked up i turned and
[1:41:00] walked away i looked back at the little
[1:41:02] fellow i thought oh god someday if i
[1:41:06] fall into a gallows
[1:41:08] or an electric chair he turn and say
[1:41:13] daddy dad
[1:41:15] you if you had done what a mother told
[1:41:19] you to do and made it home and raised me
[1:41:22] right instead of me pulling uh being
[1:41:26] pulled about from pillar to post it
[1:41:29] would not have been this way
[1:41:32] and i begin to think maybe in her death
[1:41:35] i ought to allow her going from this
[1:41:38] world maybe she was right i was married
[1:41:41] again lovely christian woman filled with
[1:41:44] the holy ghost which is my wife today a
[1:41:47] lovely person
[1:41:50] what i read there is brother branham
[1:41:54] life of was a chaos it was an unstable
[1:41:58] life
[1:41:59] and that impact that child and
[1:42:02] bodybuilding knew that this child that
[1:42:04] has no home
[1:42:07] will develop something
[1:42:10] it could be a gangster it could be in
[1:42:13] electrical chair
[1:42:15] because of
[1:42:17] the environment
[1:42:19] i raised him
[1:42:23] nature
[1:42:26] what he was trying to do
[1:42:29] he was
[1:42:30] passing down the scars that he has
[1:42:35] scars
[1:42:36] make us who we are and god came through
[1:42:40] our scars show that he's a healer god
[1:42:43] can
[1:42:44] show that he has the redemptive power
[1:42:48] god can display his redemption through
[1:42:53] our scars but our scars are not made to
[1:42:57] pass down to the next generation or to
[1:42:59] pass it around us to people that
[1:43:03] interfere with us
[1:43:06] people that are around us
[1:43:08] must receive
[1:43:10] the the manifestation of jesus christ
[1:43:14] the mind of christ that's what we pass
[1:43:17] around that's why we passed down
[1:43:20] the children will have their own scars
[1:43:22] and all that but for us my prayer is to
[1:43:26] be a blessing to the body a blessing to
[1:43:30] anybody around me i want to display
[1:43:32] christ
[1:43:33] not the spirit
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:44] nature it's not psychology abandonment
[1:43:49] calls
[1:43:50] a child
[1:43:51] a person
[1:43:53] to become narcissistic later on in life
[1:43:56] chaos in the family
[1:43:58] alcoholic family can cause those things
[1:44:03] even i heard that even a grandparent
[1:44:06] alcoholism can pass that to the children
[1:44:11] the grandchildren
[1:44:13] but there is also
[1:44:14] another thing that that
[1:44:17] people are talking about entitlement
[1:44:20] entitlement children that
[1:44:22] are in entitlement they may end up with
[1:44:26] the same
[1:44:27] condition
[1:44:29] always everything is like you go to the
[1:44:32] teacher and say journey my journey
[1:44:35] deserve a a
[1:44:37] why did you give a d
[1:44:41] johnny i've grown up knowing that i'm
[1:44:44] entitled to everything therefore
[1:44:47] get the order
[1:44:49] hey it's all about journey
[1:44:53] the spirit is there
[1:44:57] and all this they do it as a defense
[1:45:00] mechanism because they were abandoned
[1:45:03] they lived in the chaos
[1:45:06] or
[1:45:07] the extreme
[1:45:09] they were always untitled
[1:45:12] because we tell our children
[1:45:14] that you can be
[1:45:16] whatever you want to be
[1:45:19] that's what we say right
[1:45:21] i understand the encouragement that
[1:45:23] obstacles come
[1:45:26] you you can fight you don't give up
[1:45:28] easily but telling the child you can be
[1:45:32] anything you want
[1:45:33] come on
[1:45:35] a christian you say you will be what god
[1:45:38] has called you to be
[1:45:44] and i want to be where god wants me to
[1:45:47] be
[1:45:47] if he doesn't want me on a puppet no
[1:45:51] one minute spend there
[1:45:53] if he wanted me to do something that's
[1:45:56] where i'm going to be
[1:45:58] blessed and a blessing for others
[1:46:13] oh my
[1:46:15] i
[1:46:18] but uh is talking about the atmosphere
[1:46:22] that people create
[1:46:25] that atmosphere
[1:46:29] is the spirit inside them
[1:46:32] and god is telling us
[1:46:35] let the mind
[1:46:36] let the mind of christ
[1:46:38] be in you don't let that mind of the
[1:46:41] devil
[1:46:43] the antichrist spirit
[1:46:46] when you open to one you close to the
[1:46:48] other
[1:46:50] let the strong man inside
[1:46:54] the weak one will decrease and
[1:46:56] constantly decrease
[1:47:00] we are called to express him
[1:47:04] to the point that the world will not
[1:47:06] know who is who
[1:47:10] oh my don't you want that
[1:47:12] so i have so much to say about it
[1:47:15] but the time is running out
[1:47:18] i want to stop this subject that
[1:47:22] so i can take a normal subject next week
[1:47:25] god will
[1:47:30] oh my
[1:47:35] the other day i was talking to my
[1:47:36] daughter rebecca
[1:47:38] she came with her
[1:47:40] joe and
[1:47:41] they were packing to leave and we
[1:47:43] started talking about you know
[1:47:46] the word of god and
[1:47:48] deep things and and uh
[1:47:53] we start talking even about the
[1:47:55] dressing code how people wear their
[1:47:58] clothes and
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:01] at one point i said to her it's so
[1:48:04] strange that brother branham
[1:48:06] could say
[1:48:08] that pretty s
[1:48:10] lady
[1:48:12] only brother branham could say that
[1:48:15] so i came to church then very next
[1:48:17] sunday but a child was
[1:48:19] preaching about
[1:48:22] virtue and
[1:48:25] womanhood and
[1:48:27] you remember that
[1:48:28] womanhood and motherhood and he went
[1:48:33] through the
[1:48:34] dressing code we all know how we tap in
[1:48:38] god's mind
[1:48:40] and
[1:48:45] god wanted to show us because these
[1:48:46] things should not become familiar
[1:48:50] it's god showing us i was with you i saw
[1:48:53] the
[1:48:54] the need that you have i saw your
[1:48:57] concern and i saw all the things now i'm
[1:49:01] answering you i'm giving you my feedback
[1:49:04] through the pastor
[1:49:06] and us but a child is preaching the very
[1:49:09] next
[1:49:11] service after i spoke to my daughter he
[1:49:14] also stopped and said it's not strange
[1:49:16] brother branham can say
[1:49:19] a pretty
[1:49:20] lady
[1:49:22] just like i say
[1:49:24] how many times you heard about a child
[1:49:26] saying things like that
[1:49:31] then you can wonder
[1:49:33] when was it brother chad went so it was
[1:49:36] when but brother chad was very serious
[1:49:38] telling us think that was the holy ghost
[1:49:41] then when he used a little human it was
[1:49:43] not british it was not the holy ghost
[1:49:47] it was still the holy ghost even in the
[1:49:49] humerus oh so strange that brother
[1:49:51] branham
[1:49:54] brother brown can say pretty lady
[1:49:57] it was still him
[1:50:00] i'm not saying everything we say is god
[1:50:04] but that's where we are called to do
[1:50:07] we are called to be that line should be
[1:50:10] blurry
[1:50:12] where you don't know
[1:50:15] who is who
[1:50:17] this is so much christ that i i
[1:50:21] even your temperament god is using it
[1:50:25] your sense of humor or lack of it god
[1:50:28] uses it
[1:50:30] everything you are
[1:50:32] god uses it
[1:50:34] this to point that
[1:50:36] where is god and where is the person
[1:50:40] you see my mind that
[1:50:42] i i do some computers
[1:50:45] and many of you here the jiraiyas of the
[1:50:48] world here
[1:50:52] my mind is like i want to know when
[1:50:55] brother branham is talking and when he's
[1:50:57] not talking
[1:50:58] i want to know
[1:51:00] when jesus talks because whatever i'm
[1:51:02] saying whatever he told you it was like
[1:51:07] like the way he says it right
[1:51:11] i wanna
[1:51:12] write a
[1:51:14] a script brother
[1:51:17] where i wanna put brother branham words
[1:51:20] in black
[1:51:22] and put the jesus words in red
[1:51:27] computer program
[1:51:30] i'm telling you you can't do it
[1:51:33] it's so blurry
[1:51:36] even when he says sister you know i
[1:51:38] don't know you
[1:51:39] it's like the samaritan woman and
[1:51:42] oh you say well that's not
[1:51:44] jesus that's brother branham
[1:51:50] and then he said whatever he told you
[1:51:52] i don't even know
[1:51:54] i'm telling you it's so blurry
[1:51:56] it's a blending in time
[1:52:01] because another place he will tell you
[1:52:04] i see myself talking to the audience
[1:52:08] and i was somewhere else i see myself
[1:52:12] who was talking
[1:52:14] all the things about preparing people's
[1:52:17] mind telling them
[1:52:19] like
[1:52:20] uh netanyahu like the samaritan woman
[1:52:24] maybe he was not verbal at all
[1:52:27] where is he
[1:52:28] here or there
[1:52:31] my program will crash
[1:52:38] but that's where god wants us to be
[1:52:42] that they say is christ or is baracadima
[1:52:47] is it bird death or
[1:52:49] is christ
[1:52:50] is the manifestation that's where we're
[1:52:53] going and the devil is putting all the
[1:52:56] things that he can on our way so we
[1:52:59] can't manifest that
[1:53:02] but he's defeated
[1:53:13] oh my i
[1:53:16] i hate
[1:53:17] your pizza will get cold
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:21] i still have a lot of things to say
[1:53:26] but
[1:53:27] i really wanted to finish that subject
[1:53:31] and take a more relaxed this has been a
[1:53:34] burden to me
[1:53:36] it's a burden to me
[1:53:38] maybe my personality doesn't show it
[1:53:43] it's a very important subject
[1:53:48] i want to kind of put aside because god
[1:53:52] when he show you something is for his
[1:53:54] body
[1:53:55] if somebody needs it
[1:53:59] so
[1:54:01] ah
[1:54:07] amen
[1:54:10] this is what he want us to do
[1:54:14] 1956
[1:54:16] why are people so toast about
[1:54:19] and when christ the holy ghost comes
[1:54:21] into your heart
[1:54:22] is in your
[1:54:24] in you with your temperament
[1:54:27] is living in his own life through his
[1:54:30] own will through you hallelujah i know
[1:54:33] that sounds awful but it's right christ
[1:54:36] you're so healed you are that christ
[1:54:38] speaks the kind of words
[1:54:41] you will speak
[1:54:42] he thinks
[1:54:44] the kind of thoughts he would think
[1:54:46] through you
[1:54:48] he does the kind of works he will do
[1:54:51] through you you are yielded and resting
[1:54:54] that what a beautiful picture of a
[1:54:57] consecrated christian
[1:54:59] yielded
[1:55:00] god is working through
[1:55:03] even your temperament
[1:55:05] if you are quiet if you are more
[1:55:08] you know
[1:55:09] uh
[1:55:10] you know
[1:55:11] more talkative or whatever
[1:55:15] you consecrate your life he uses what is
[1:55:18] dedicated to him
[1:55:21] and he can
[1:55:23] think is
[1:55:24] thought to you and you can see brother
[1:55:27] branham
[1:55:29] he's just saying that
[1:55:31] just say that
[1:55:32] it's him it's not me
[1:55:35] and you see he say oh
[1:55:38] this thing is called what uh it's called
[1:55:43] you know
[1:55:44] jesus knows the name
[1:55:46] but he's using brother mind
[1:55:49] to speak it that way it sounds like his
[1:55:52] brother bread
[1:55:53] it's blurry
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:58] ah
[1:56:05] let me uh
[1:56:07] wind down here
[1:56:09] the anointed
[1:56:10] the end time 1965
[1:56:13] in the very day that the son of man is
[1:56:15] revealed revelation 10 1 to 7 read it
[1:56:18] when you get home the seven angels
[1:56:22] message opening up the seals what is
[1:56:25] what is it
[1:56:26] not the angel is the son of man but the
[1:56:29] messenger is revealing the son of man
[1:56:33] can you get it separate now that's where
[1:56:36] it seems to be so hard for you to see
[1:56:39] not the son of man himself but the seven
[1:56:42] angel the seventh angel messenger is
[1:56:45] revealing to the public the son of man
[1:56:48] because it's let the
[1:56:50] it's it's left the shock it can't
[1:56:53] organize it it's the grain itself again
[1:56:58] you can't
[1:56:59] he was trying to show that you can't
[1:57:02] separate
[1:57:03] it's so hard to separate
[1:57:05] this the
[1:57:07] earthly angel
[1:57:09] with the
[1:57:10] heavenly angel it's so blurry it's a
[1:57:13] blending time
[1:57:14] and today is the same thing that's where
[1:57:17] god wants us to go
[1:57:19] that's where he want us to get to the
[1:57:22] relationship is so entertaining that
[1:57:25] people have
[1:57:27] hard time to separate who is who
[1:57:31] amen
[1:57:32] but what the devil has tried to do is to
[1:57:36] remove that relationship
[1:57:38] and favored
[1:57:40] compliance
[1:57:43] rather than
[1:57:45] relationship
[1:57:47] you comply you're good
[1:57:50] no
[1:57:52] compliance is not greater than
[1:57:54] relationship
[1:57:56] you see it that spirit is
[1:58:00] all over the place
[1:58:02] i don't i just cannot get into all these
[1:58:07] details
[1:58:09] people
[1:58:10] even it goes everywhere at your job
[1:58:15] in the families with
[1:58:17] friends and even the church
[1:58:20] i saw the spirit even on the pulpit
[1:58:24] sometimes
[1:58:26] many times actually i'm trying to clean
[1:58:29] it
[1:58:33] the up
[1:58:34] spirit
[1:58:37] i saw it
[1:58:40] you go in a place people don't even have
[1:58:43] the liberty
[1:58:44] to manifest their joy
[1:58:47] by listening to the word they have
[1:58:49] manufactured that for them they
[1:58:54] you cannot maybe do this i don't want to
[1:58:57] get in the details
[1:59:00] but what is it
[1:59:01] is that same spirit that
[1:59:04] uh destroyed the relationship with
[1:59:07] christ if it with the human being to put
[1:59:10] that spirit of cain
[1:59:13] it does not have to be that extreme but
[1:59:17] anything that does not exalt christ
[1:59:22] we want it to to get away to be removed
[1:59:26] from our life how do you do it by
[1:59:31] not a code of conduct but by letting the
[1:59:35] word but i i hear that i we have to let
[1:59:39] the word i have done it
[1:59:41] continue doing it it means there's still
[1:59:45] some greenness whatever there's still
[1:59:48] some shadows some darkness in some
[1:59:51] regions that's why god continue continue
[1:59:54] listening to the word continue
[1:59:56] praying let that darkness keep going
[2:00:00] because in reality sons and daughters of
[2:00:04] god have to be manifested on earth again
[2:00:15] that spirit
[2:00:21] we are not looking for a code of conduct
[2:00:24] we're looking for him to take over
[2:00:28] and go into all the region the light
[2:00:31] goes into the all the region
[2:00:35] and cast out all that
[2:00:38] lack of empathy and all those things
[2:00:41] you know i was remembering brother
[2:00:44] kyle preaching and say how can
[2:00:48] you intercede
[2:00:50] if you don't
[2:00:52] feel empathy cannot make you feel
[2:00:57] it's a demon spirit
[2:01:00] you can only
[2:01:02] intercede if you can feel the pain the
[2:01:05] situation that person is going to
[2:01:09] therefore the devil wants to actually
[2:01:13] i you know
[2:01:14] is
[2:01:15] trying to put a
[2:01:17] to stop the works of god
[2:01:21] and
[2:01:22] let him do it elsewhere i am called to
[2:01:27] manifest to express christ in this dying
[2:01:32] world but i'm used to pray i'm living in
[2:01:36] a dying world among dying people
[2:01:39] but in the shadow
[2:01:42] of death
[2:01:43] the light of shine the people that live
[2:01:47] in the shadow of death
[2:01:49] their
[2:01:50] light has come to you
[2:01:52] that light cast out all the evil all the
[2:01:56] germs
[2:01:58] all everything
[2:02:00] so god
[2:02:01] help us this morning
[2:02:04] remember
[2:02:05] not a code of conduct how to behave well
[2:02:09] but receiving the word
[2:02:11] it will do the rest
[2:02:12] you believe that
[2:02:14] it all stand as the
[2:02:17] come in
[2:02:37] as they're coming we i'm just going to
[2:02:40] read the
[2:02:42] first timothy
[2:02:44] god is doing diagnostic
[2:02:47] of this age
[2:02:49] to timothy
[2:02:51] chapter 3 verse 1.
[2:02:57] he say that
[2:02:58] this
[2:03:01] this known also
[2:03:03] that in the last days
[2:03:06] perilous times shall come
[2:03:09] you can remove the display brother
[2:03:11] if you want
[2:03:13] for men
[2:03:14] shall be lovers
[2:03:16] of own cells
[2:03:19] sounds like a psychologist talking here
[2:03:21] now
[2:03:22] you know i read it again
[2:03:24] this know also that in the last days
[2:03:28] perilous times shall come
[2:03:31] for men shall be lovers of their own
[2:03:33] selves
[2:03:35] covetous
[2:03:37] boosters
[2:03:39] proud
[2:03:40] blasphemers
[2:03:42] disobedient to parents
[2:03:44] unthankful
[2:03:47] they are unthankful because they
[2:03:49] untitled
[2:03:51] unholy without natural
[2:03:53] affection truth breakers false accusers
[2:03:57] incontinent fears
[2:03:59] despise of those that are good
[2:04:02] traitors
[2:04:04] haiti high-minded lovers of pleasures
[2:04:08] more than lovers
[2:04:09] of god
[2:04:13] what a diagnostic from the holy ghost
[2:04:17] yet the holy ghost say that
[2:04:19] despite all this
[2:04:25] you
[2:04:26] will display christ to the dying world
[2:04:31] or we need
[2:04:32] people
[2:04:33] we need somebody
[2:04:35] to pray about it
[2:04:37] you need the person
[2:04:39] that goes through this
[2:04:42] to surrender completely to the lord
[2:04:46] i told you about
[2:04:48] question and answer that brother branham
[2:04:53] received
[2:04:54] in 1964

[2:10:55] extreme behaviors and things
[2:10:59] but yet
[2:11:02] we still have
[2:11:04] that sticky nature in us
[2:11:07] and the more we receive your word and
[2:11:10] feed on that word
[2:11:13] a change takes place

[2:11:19] in us father and one day
[2:11:23] you mature in us and
[2:11:25] [Music]

[2:11:31] is it him
[2:11:33] or is christ
[2:11:35] and that's where you want to bring to us
[2:11:39] with our own ability we cannot
[2:11:43] we cannot do it father
