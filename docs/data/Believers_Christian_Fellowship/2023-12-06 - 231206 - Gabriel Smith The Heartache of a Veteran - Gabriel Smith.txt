redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin well how we'll shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in and there will be a great procession over on the streets of

appreciate the Lord um so uh if we can we'll just get right into um the scriptures this evening um Luke chap 2 uh Luke Chapter 2 uh verse 21 and uh and I I'd like to speak to you this evening uh on um just a little thought on the heartache of a veteran um Luke 2 and verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it was written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb shall be caught holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout out waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came in by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law they took him he him up in his own arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has pre prepared before the face of all the people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer precious Lord so thankful to be able to gather here this evening and in the world in chaos and know where to turn and confusion on every hand we're so thankful Lord that you've gave given us a refuge in a time of need and Lord we're truly unworthy to stand here before the purchase of your blood and uh just pray Lord that you would have your way as only you can in this service you you know the needs of my brothers and sisters and Lord I I've did all that I know how to do to try to find your mind for this evening and so we just want to yield to you Lord and let you say what want what needs to be said God that I I I would have um the courage to say what you want said and the wisdom to say not what needs to be said and so we surrender Lord ourselves to you and I pray that we could enter in Lord and and pray pray that you would just have full sway Lord to deal with our hearts including mine that we could all be modable Lord and teachable this evening Lord that it would be a teachable moment for all of us for that's what we came here to do is to learn of you so we look into your Eternal Word tonight and ask your blessings to be upon it and we ask these things to be so in the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you be seated if you like um the the heartache of a veteran and you know uh thinking about Simeon um I guess I just not realized this December so I wouldn't even maybe it's a little Christmas message I don't know I I didn't I didn't I didn't uh I didn't realize it was December so uh but um you know um you think of Simeon and um as it was at the first coming we know that it's going to be that same uh scenario right now and there wasn't but just a handful of of Believers that was uh waiting uh uh for the Messiah the anointed one and when he came he came in such a strange way that uh the multitudes missed him and you know you you think of Simeon he was a devout man a just man faithful at his post of Duty he had he had fought a good fight he had finished his course and it was the very climax of his ministry and you know if you would look at him uh from um maybe a bystander perspective um the prophet tells us that everybody mocked him um they thought he was off in his head you know he was getting old and and you know the scile was creeping in you know and um but there wasn't cile creeping in and and he wasn't n uh some uh old man that was off at his head a little bit but he was elect of God that was in the channel of God and and was ordained to see the Son of God and even though uh he may have looked strange to everybody else uh I you know I I I kind of felt sorry for him to to think of the heartache that that veteran uh had went through you know he was faithful uh for years upon years and when he comes to the very climax of it and and it's the fulfill and you know that's that's how a lot of times how it happens to us when we actually come to our position we look crazy to the world and and people think we're off and we it don't make no sense but but whenever God shows us something it don't matter what the world thanks and you know the heartache that that man had to carry uh I I know it no doubt had to be great um for for the things that the prophet of God gave us insight into in his life and you know uh but but I I I I think of another uh group of of veterans you know uh cuz I I I got to be honest with you you know when we we go through life um my um you know you know you always take inventory of your life and you sometimes you want wonder why do I tick the way that I tick right and um I U my you know um I think it's always good that you kind of uh take inventory of your life and uh that's that's way I don't know I don't know how y'all do it uh but how I do it I I like to analyze myself and why why do I why do I do the things that I do and why do I act why do I my why do my thought process tesses are the way that they are and you know um I I think sometimes in life uh um we have um circumstances in life that happens to us and it it molds us a certain way it makes us a certain way and um you know I ain't uh hesitate saying this I hope you understand I A A ain't trying to uh cry on nobody's shoulders but you know when you when you come from a broken home and you don't have a a father figure uh in your life on a regular basis uh it it puts a gap there and when you when you you young ones you you uh ought to be ashamed of yourself if you're critical on Mom and Dad because they make a little mistake here and there because it's the it's the it's a what a blessing it is to have Mom and Dad in the household no no matter how hard that maybe sometimes you may think they are you know but uh no matter how bad you may think you have it people got a whole lot worse and uh some of you been you know born with a silver messy spoon in your mouth and yeah y'all ain't got a clue what ruggedness is but but you know but you sometimes you got to step back a little bit and count your blessings you know cuz as young people you can look at Mom and Dad and you know you you can look so much at their bad parts that you never you never acknowledge their good parts and uh you know uh brother brandham taught us that uh parents will live uh their best and their worst at home and as as young people you got to be mindful of that but uh you also have to make a a choice on your own self that I'm not going to focus on just the bad but I'm also going to look at the good and and uh but you know uh and I'm I'm not here to I don't even want to try to shine a light on my family in a negative way but growing up in a broken home you know um you you you go through life and and there's that void because you don't have that father figure on a daily basis you don't you don't have that rock every night that you can look to and and when you lay your head on your pillow you know he's in the Next Room or you know he's coming home soon or you know what I mean and and you can you can let that become common to you and you can you can not give it the credit or the or the attention that it's due but but if you do have that you're a blessed young person uh tonight and and to grow up with a with a mom and dad and all their mistakes they still are are are striving uh to serve the Lord and and when they make a mistake they they repent yes amen yes now brother Emanuel I appreciate the amens but he ain't got the amen for all of yous now yep amen thank you yes and you know but because of the lack of that type of leadership in in my life I I've always um I've always had a weakness there for elders uh in the sense of I you know uh that I think that's one of the reasons why I love the prophet so much is because he was he was such a such a a rock he always Dependable you know what I mean never was no change in him and and I don't know if you've ever there's a um there's a um a tape recording of him um um around a kitchen table um and um it's not a you'd have to go on like YouTube or and you'd um I think it's something like a conversation with banks Woods or something like that but anyway anyways it's on it's online but if if You' listened to that the the amazing thing to me is that when he's that prophet of God Malachi 4 when he's sitting around that kitchen table and sister Woods is is correcting him and uh you know she's like tell them this tell him and uh Malachi 4 you know he's like oh yeah and uh but the amazing thing is is it to me is when when when he's when he's talking and just having a little bible sty talking about the things of the Lord that when when he's there if if you didn't know that he was at a kitchen table if if I if I took that and and and switched it with another tape when he was in you know in shreport or or or if he's at Jeffersonville or wherever it was I you could take that same you know they take that same man and and he didn't preach any different whether he was around the kitchen table or preaching to half a million Souls it it he he he was he was solid he was firm and and you know that they the thing I loved about him is there wasn't no you know was no preacher voice that came out you know I mean it wasn't no no polish he was just and what I what I and you know I was thinking about this just in the back room there that you know brother Brandon would always say I don't have a personality anybody ever hear him say that and I always wondered we don't have no personality but it just struck me back there that when I was coming up here it's like the reason why he would say that is because as Ministry we can project a personality and not the Holy Spirit right and and and and unfortunately um in in in in amongst our ranks is is you have that uh I didn't want to start there but you understand what I'm saying the point is is we're not here to project a personality we we're here to surrender to the holy spirit that that the Holy Spirit can project Divine love to his people and and and to me that's what what what I love about that Prophet is because he was he was so he is so real and when he speaks it's it's a level of sincerity that um you you you it's it's a it's a rare thing and and uh oh I want to be I want to be that sincere someday and and and that's what I'm I'm striving for every day of my life is to die out more so that so that more of that Holy Spirit sincerity can shine through in my life and you know and and so I I I for me I'm I'm I'm kind of I'm kind of um um partial I'm sorry for you ones that's like 30 40 I'm not too partial to you you just but you know you give me one of them brothers that that's got about 60 65 70 80 years old and and them are the ones that I love I love to snuggle up to because the thing of it is is you can learn something see I my whole life I I'm um I'm I'm I want wisdom and I want to understand and I and I want to I want to live the right kind of life and and the thing of it is is I as I see elders and when I see that little gleam in their eyes it it's like it's something just it it just something clicks and I say that's the one and and then and then when when an opportunity arrives I I hope you young people right y'all need to be taking I don't see no pens moving I need to be taking some notes on that because the problem of it is is when we think we got it all figured out that's when we know we wrong and unfortunately our elders don't get the attention that they are deserving and if we would apply that we would get more of life and it would help us to bypass all the problems that we run into but but the thing of it is is we have such a pride that that we think we got it all figured out but the key to it all is to humble yourself and ask questions the only way you're going to learn is to ask questions and and and to be able to to to have a uh a vulnerability and really whenever you tap into that vulnerability it's really a strength because when you you see somebody that puts up a facade on on that beyond that facade they're afraid but but if you meet somebody that'll open themselves up and be honest and transparent it shows that they're secure in who they really are and and and if and and the thing of it is I I I I see a lot of times as people go through years of that per of of that of that um that that facade that that they miss so many opportunities in growing in the Lord and and you know whether it be preacher or you know whoever I mean the thing of it is is we got to have humility in this thing called life there's there's you know you know brother Brenham talked about uh uh them old oak trees and you know when uh but Tommy Osborne come to him and you you know brother brandom had had performed that Miracle on that maniac and that man fell at his feet and and and you know after that brother Tommy came to brother brandom said brother brandom do do you think I got a gift of healing and uh he said old Tomy he said listen if you're called to be a preacher you have the a gift of of healing and then he said and he and he took it a step further he said every believer has that ability to pray and receive healing anden see and and uh he he he he told he told Brother Tommy said look Tommy he said you see that old oak tree over there sitting down and he he was looking at uh I think it was brother FF Bosworth if I ain't mistaken and uh and he said why don't you go sit under him for a year year and a half you know and then and he he listened to that prophet and and when he did that there was fruit from his ministry after that but but he had to have the ability to Humble themselves you know and and I think sometimes Brethren sisters we have we have the message you know in every form possible whether it be iPad phone computer you know uh I'm sure if you got a smart watching somehow get it on there and but but you know you'll never have the wisdom to to to hit the right keystrokes if you have the wrong attitude and and it takes a level of humility to to say I'm not going to study it out I'm going to pray it out and you know you know something that I'm I'm I'm coming into in my life and I know this is a different service but I can't help but just to be who I am and how I'm feeling but uh you know something that I've I I've come to I I I really felt like you know the past I don't know short while I I've really tapped into this uh like a like a just a burden for for um just for prayer um and and uh cuz I think I think so many times you know know even as a minister what I found in my own self because you have a gift you see things in the message that others don't see and and just out of a god-given gift you have the ability to compile and it be good but but I I wonder and I I won't Wonder no I I say in my ownself I I have a question if I didn't if I didn't set the Holy Spirit aside sometime times because it's so easy for us to lean on our intellect and and it's so easy for us to lean on a gift being our own and and and and let me say this it it's also easy for for us to be in the comfort of our own home and lean upon you know the prophet and not lean upon the gifts in the body amen see it's it's a Razor's Edge in on all of this the and and to me that's why I feel more and more um like a like a like a burning uh um urgency to to to to be mindful of how razor sharp edge it is because when you look amongst our own ranks there's there's so many facets to it and you wonder well which one is the right facet you know and and to me friends ultimately you you have to you have to fight it out on your own and and you have to take it serious look because here's the thing it's not about us just being cleaned up there's going to be millions that are cleaned up that miss it and are going to be left behind and and got and got you know the table app on their FR on their phone but you know and and and got no doubt uh a Bible app and a and a audio Bible app and they you know they got the our daily bread and you know all these devotionals and but but you know all of those don't do no good what what I really want to what I really want to see is let me get into your settings amen yes that's what I want to see Let Let me let now don't don't erase your history either now hold on now don't erase your history I I want to see your settings and I want to I want to look at I want to look at your time frame and I want to see I want to see your your your table app time span versus your Facebook I I want I hey hey you say brother Gabe listen I'm not sitting in the seat of the scornful I was guilty you know you know we can we we can here's the thing and and this is this is a scary part ain't going to be no alcohol involved ain't going to be no drugs see but but the thing of it is is where is it taking you and and that's where we have to be honest with ourselves where are we at friends listen when when when when we come to the spot we have to be honest and ask ourselves what trees are we sitting under right I mean is it is it the tree of knowledge of good and evil or is it the tree of life because that choice is set before us every day of our life which one of we going to sit under I want to sit under the tree of life and and in order to do that that's the harder choice and and even you know even talking you know I was so nerv nervous about this thought I I'll be honest with you brother brother Bob I was I know you you was away on vacation I was thinking oh I hope he's here tonight I so happy to see you brother he been on my heart and I you know I was talking to the Lord I said Lord I said brother Bob he ought to preach uh he he's definitely more uh qualified to take a title like that the heartache of a veteran and who am i i a i a you know uh and but but the thing of it is is you know to me when you can see and I'm not just talking about brother Bob there's lots of you and I I won't call your names out cuz I know some of you don't like being called out so I won't say who it is but listen to me as as a youngster when I can walk up to you and I and I can see that you've been down a few roads in your life but there's still a sweetness about you there's still a tenderness about you you know the other day when brother Chad was preaching I I I you know uh I I was I was so Soul he was preaching on you know uh repentance and and uh man I I just had to get to the Altar and you know when I was praying asking the Lord crying out to him searching my life overturning every Rock You know I couldn't help but the he on this ear over here her brother Bob praying right beside me I said oh my hey to me that you know what I mean that's that's a that's the heartache of a veteran you know he ain't saying oh I'm too old to go to the altar prise God come on friends but you know what happens you know why we don't go to the altar cuz we're worried about what everybody else is going to think well brother Gabe I don't want to look like a sinner well oh you praise the lord well let me ask you something let me ask you something did did you go a whole three days without sentence since the last service I mean man I mean uh if you did uh I'm sure brother Chad ain't going to mind you come on up here and give us your secret recipe cuz I mean I you you you see what I'm saying friends but the thing of it is is because we we we get these things in our mind and and we we have this we have this image that we want to protect and right there we miss our opportunity because what if what if what if what if brother Gabe needed your hands laid on what what if what if what if it it had to be brother Les and you amen cuz he was the one up there laying hands on me praying for me you understand what I'm saying friend the thing of it is what what I'm what I want what I'm trying to get to what's on my heart is we got to to me I'm searching out my heart in so many areas overturning everything and you know what is so beautiful is when you overturn everything and it's peace amen you know when when you overturn every Rock and you just see God's delivering hand on it and and and you know uh for so many years I turn over a rock and it was like man oh man come on but and I'm sure there's going to be a rock turned up tomorrow now that I said that you know but that's okay because the thing of it is is the grace of God is going to be there to help me through that whatever that thing is and the whole point is it's relationship it's relationship ship with the Lord Jesus and I'm I'm finding I'm finding a closeness to him like like I I don't even know how to explain it I mean to me it's just like Lord I don't know I I I I don't even I try not to be spiritual and they like seven seal with just silence you know you you don't have words you know you don't have words to say you know what I mean the other day other day uh Ser was so powerful uh it was like four times in service I I I started like in my mind it's like I want to speak in tongues and I was just like I had to bite it down you know because I didn't have I didn't have a I didn't have a way to praise him I didn't have that language that I wanted you understand what I'm saying oh man you know this makes me feel weird cuz I'm just talking to you this is just this ain't much preaching this is just is this okay y y okay but the thing to me friends is look it God is real amen he is so real and and to me it's just like like it's that Roman candles going off in so many facets that it to me it's overwhelming sometimes I feel sorry for [Laughter] Joshua cuz I'm I'm trying to hold it you know I got I got I got some I got a little bit of voice to me if y'all didn't know and I feel sorry for him because he's right right in front of me so I try to direct it and then is then brother John's like yeah thanks brother Gabe I appreciate it keep it in the family brother I just I just uh to me here's the thing and I know you know you think about this I feel like nowadays like I'm some season like I've been preaching for years years and I look at I ain't been here but a handful of times but it just feels so real to me but I I get up here and you know brother B says when you get up there if you don't have nothing else just tell them how the candle got lit you know that's where I'm at friends and I can't help it I got 96 slides I told I told Brother Franco I showed him I showed him one he was like oh man I never seen and and uh uh I I I told him I said well brother we probably ain't going to get to that so here brother Franco look brother Franco let's uh this one is uh brother Franco can you go to 87 brother 87 look he got a scroll of waves 87 brother he's talking about this in the back now you want to think about you know we we talk about how how powerful the Bible is but God in five in in five you know words or something you understand what I'm saying but in in the first sentence of the Bible God would say in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period but God is so beautiful that scientists wouldn't tap into this till hundreds of years later and they would say that there's five elements that make up what we live in and that's Time Force energy space and matter those are the things that that that that make our world and yet we know it's not force but it's God but that's what science says but but you think about how how God is so mindful that he can he can he can he can make a a language in the first few or the first sentence that's ever expressed would Express what we live in I mean I mean you know you know but the thing of it is the problem of it is friends is we let these things become common to us and we go oh man brother Chad he's reading Genesis again you know you know there's uh brother brother brandom in 1964 um I got a slide but I don't know where it's at it's probably like 70 or 80 but in 1964 he preaches a message and the sub and the and the the the scripture that he uses is a greater than Solomon is here the Queen of Sheba and and when he when he says that he he says um that his is uh he um oh man let's see here brother Franco 75 brother 75 Teamwork Makes the Dream Work what now watch what brother Bram says now this is 1964 brother brandham is at the end of his ministry and he reads a scripture that that he has he has um he has mentioned the Queen of Sheba 124 times on tape he's preached it 13 times that we have recorded brother Brenham said 150 times on tape a greater than Solomon is is here and 12 times he preached the greater than Solomon is here and at the end of that prophets Road and he would read a scripture that he has read Around the World time and time again but when he prays watch what his first sentence is Lord Jesus as we read these stories of the Bible our hearts jump for joy see where look what what is all our files going to do on our computer friends if we don't have that if we don't have that we missed it we missed it friends we are leaning on our intellect and we're leaning on what we can compile and how well we can see it and we're missing the essence of eternal life the very essence of eternal life that Prophet is showing us that at the end of his ministry he would say oh I've I've used that scripture too much you okay we got some can I get a preacher here say Amen if they ever well I used that that I used that scripture three weeks ago I I can't preach that subject again oh brother boy y'all brothers man come on up there man I see the thing of it is is because we think oh well they already know that I can't but but the thing of it is Friends brother brandham is showing us something in that he's Malachi 4 but he takes something like that and he ain't got no artificial put on but when he reads that thing after this is 64 after what 50 years 40 years well however many years it's been uh he started preaching at what 33 I mean you I mean me it's 30 some odd years of of laboring in this and when he when he reads it the first thing that comes out of his heart to the Lord is my heart jumps for Joy am yes to me that's that that's that's that's what I want I I I want that and if it doesn't see this is this is where I'm coming to that that that if it doesn't then what I do is I close the Bible and I go pray cuz studying don't matter and and the thing of it is friends is that's when we can lean on our intellect the the whole point is we have to we have to we have and listen it is not easy because it takes Faith to believe that God hears your prayer amen and and that's the problem we are afraid that God isn't hearing our prayer so we don't want to go in prayer and be disappointed oh come on friends please somebody say Amen y'all know what I'm talking about friends because of because of of whatever busyness and hustle and bustle and all these different things we live in a neurotic world and you I none of us are immune from it not a one of us is but the the thing of it is is we have to be able to be honest with ourselves and say God this world is pulling me this way but I want to go that way that's where I'm at friends and I I I and and to me I I'll be honest with you this I have I'm listening to myself and it's like Lord what am I doing but to me this is freedom to me this is Liberty to be able to to to to actually be a real Christian like like you understand what I'm saying friends like when you know you know you know whenever you can you know a lot of times you I don't know if all of you um I I'll just be honest with you you know uh I come out of Great Tribulation that's the only thing I can say um you know um I spit I spent a um I spent a um a lot of years T up struggling um when you when you go through life um sometimes sometimes life is is um so confusing to you that's right and you try trying to find the purpose of it and you think you got the purpose figured out and it thow throws you a curveball and then you go well now what do I do and you know um you know I I I I look at the young people and they got they got so much potential and to me it's like I want to do everything I can to to help them to achieve their potential because there's so many people that want to tear you down and destroy you because they don't want to see anybody be an overcomer cuz it's going to bring condemnation to them you know and and and you look at you look at you look at children that that that y'all don't realize um the Wows that the enemy tries to put on You by making the world seem so uh much greater than a Christian walk but if you could if you could I wish you could step into my heart and and and and go back through through the alleys and and and the pitfalls and the and the in the corruption and perversion just to catch a glimpse and and then and then set in the service and feel the presence of God and it would it would take every bit of that wonder and question out of you but I but I can't do it but but oh how I would love to do I would I'd give anything to to to be able to do that because you young people have such a a blessed uh uh uh uh hope before you but but you got to realize the potential that's there and and and then you got to hold it and be mindful and and unfortunately some of you ain't going to catch it and then you're going to have to have a old veteran put his arm around you and go yeah I know I did that too yeah messed up too and it'll be an honest veteran that'll come to you and go yeah yeah know but the problem of it is if you got polish and and Persona you you won't humble yourself and say it but but to me friends the you you know you know what what I what I love I I can talk about my past because my past is not my present and that's the beauty of it like I've been delivered and and so to me I don't I don't have that shame I'm ashamed of it but but all it is is a testimony of God's over overcoming power and and and the thing of it is no matter what Pitfall you fell into look there there it ain't nothing that that's uh uncommon everyone of every human being has F has fallen in some way shape or form but but the thing of it is is is is is we're so ashamed of that that we don't want to relate to it but but a lot of times we miss the opportunity to help a youngster amise God be be because it's not easy but if it was easy everybody be a Christian that's right but but it it it takes honesty it takes sincerity amen it takes time and effort it it takes years of looking at yourself and hating what you see but yet you keep on going cuz you know it's something real I'm telling you if you can show me something real in this message please show me cuz I ain't I a my little PE brain experience of life it's the most beautiful thing I've ever saw brother die for this thing hey that's right tell me where to go hey uh but you know um in life um in life I would encourage you young people to to be mindful of the oak trees that's around you cuz one day they won't be there right yes amen and you will miss your opportunity to spend some time under that oak tree all the little saplings may be fun but you're never going to get anything from them right but if you can find the old oak tree and cast that reel you get them hooked in you poke them a little bit get them get them talking right and ask a question then you let them go and then start listening and before not they'll start they'll start dropping wisdom on you you be [Music] like but it takes time takes effort and it takes humility cuz you got to set your life aside and go wait a minute I want to prepare for tomorrow and I don't know how to prepare for tomorrow but that person is already been through my tomorrow and so if they've already been through you tomorrow wouldn't it be good for you to check with them today we we uh we're we're in a battle and um you know it's quiet in here not a lot going on everybody kind of relaxed but all the Imagine how many devils in hell trying to distract you right now trying to throw me off in um boyy I tell you uh brother Franco could you help me out please and uh go to um let's go to slide three please thank you brother brother Braham says um let your light so shine before men we don't have to preach to 10,000 we don't have to even preach we can be God's advertisement board how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel some of you older men you old women start them young men on the field out there to win 10,000 souls to Christ it was because that he saw Christ in you it's you presented it Christ to him in the simple power of the gospel and you know you know what I'm finding more and more you know I I uh I spent like two three months listening to the seventh seal over and over and over that's the only message I listened to and you know I didn't compile a bunch of quotes I didn't come up with no seven seal book but when it's all said and done it to me it was like a mirror and I looked at myself and I saw um it uncovered me in such a way that I I I saw how how short I was coming up and and it and it gave me but it wasn't like a fear it wasn't it it was more of like a a piece like like um like I knew the Lord was with me and and and it and it and it and it helped me to to understand that and maybe this ain't you but a lot of times I think I do I want to I want to I want to understand the message and I got to put it out and I got to get all these quotes and but I realize I realize that that's that's not that's not it you'll never understand the Plan of Redemption like that it cuz it's hidden and then when you see when you and when when you catch a glimpse of it and then God starts showing you more and more I'm I'm I'm I'm coming to a place that it's like um I'm I'm I'm trying to watch my words because I don't want to sound preacher I don't I'm not trying to to me this message just gives you rest yes amen and and and it and it it it's given me like a freedom and and I'm talking about the seventh seal the the coming of the Lord I'm talking about this message the gospel what it was sent for what it's what it's loose to us in this life last day and it and it and it and it it really does give you the power to overcome the world yes and and and and it's and and you don't have to compile you don't have to compile nothing it builds you and and and the thing of it is the what I'm learning to do is just to relax amen and sometimes Enjoy the Silence cuz you know you know when I come to that Altar and I was I was crying out to the Lord it was it was it wasn't like the Thunderbolts I was shaking and trembling on the inside but it was it was it was it was it was I got to stop I want to no I don't I don't um all I'm trying to say friends is God gives you a peace when when when when you really catch a hold of God it is it is the essence of eternal life is so precious because you don't have words to express it you you you that's why as almost like I understand why sometimes you feel like you need a Heavenly language because you can't explain what you're feeling there is such a freedom and a liberty that that comes with this thing called Christ that it's it's unexplainable and and and to me it it I'm I'm I I I feel bad because I'm just I never would have expected this um this this service to go this way um but I don't know what else to do but just be me and so I hope it blesses one the rest of you I hope it blessed somebody because uh um I I don't know I I I feel like I I feel like Gabriel Smith is is somebody that's totally new and I don't know who he is I really don't like like like my Ministry like like my my my my life uh people at work are walking up to me going are you okay you know and I'm like yeah I'm fine I just they're like well yeah but you ain't all cutting I like you know not like I'm I don't ever cut up dirty nothing like that but they're like but I to me it's like Lord I want to be more serious I want to be more sincere Something's Happened to Me friends and I don't know how to explain it I really don't all I know is that God is like unfolding himself to me in such a way that it's like I sit in that seat back there and just the presence of the Lord is just so strong and I I'll be honest with you a couple couple Sundays ago I had some things on my heart I was crying out to L about it I was like Lord and when I I was asking the Lord in my heart brother Chad was answering me I'm talking about like that I'm talking about I asked a question and brother Chad would answer it it was just like I was just I was sitting there and just oh like what I don't I mean you understand what I'm saying and to me friends look I mean I know there has to be somebody that's struggling in here cuz there's too many people but all I'm trying to tell you is just keep going look you you you you you may be struggling with something and you're like why in the world do I keep coming to church why in the world do I keep dealing with this what what in the world I it ought to be over with I'm tired of don't give up amen look I I I I'm telling you if if if God will do it for me God will do it for you cuz I ain't nobody I ain't nobody listen I I I I come from a broken home I I come from look I come from filth and and Corruption and just mess so ain't nothing special about me so if God will do it for me do it for thank you brother John that's exactly right that's exactly right that ain't being humble that's just truth so so so where you're at what I'm trying to tell you is is be honest with yourself yesen don't deny where you're at be honest with God and and say Lord look you're struggling and you feel like Judas is a carot okay well listen you ain't Judas sistic car there was only one so you can rest in that what I would encourage you to do is talk to the Lord and say Lord this how I'm feeling yes struggling I don't feel like he like seed I don't feel like bride of Christ why me Lord how in the world look look at all my brethren and me over here well listen there's there's a there's a scripture for you because you ought to rejoice in that because you know what you're not the Pharisee over pounding his chest but you're the one you're the Publican off in the corner saying Lord you understand what I'm saying for that's the whole point there's only one righteous there's only one and a lot of times we'll we we'll we'll we'll we'll spend years laboring under the load of condemnation in our life because of something we did years ago and for whatever reason we won't let ourselves Go free because you can be free if you want to but the thing of it is a lot of times it's not so much the devil that's holding you bound it's your own mind it's your own perception and and I I want to share this with you um and we'll we'll close on this I don't want and so some something something I did Rec well it's been a while ago I'll say recently it's been a while ago that I I was struggling with something right and it like something clicked on the inside of me and something said to me how would you counsel you if you come to you with that problem and I and I thought about it and I thought H how would I counsel me if me came to I and sister Luan something happened you know cuz I realized that I could have all kind of Grace for everybody else but I couldn't have Grace for myself because I took what I was dealing with and I flipped it and then I I I thought well wait a minute cuz then I started I started analyzing myself and and and I started counseling myself and um and I I asked myself well what's your problem and uh you know as I I started talking to myself I realized that what had happened in my life it wasn't my fault what what I had been exposed to in my childhood at an early age it wasn't my fault I was only 6 years old and I looked at that little six-year-old boy and I had Grace for him and I I looked at that little six-year-old boy and I saw how he grew up I saw the Innocence that was taken from him at an early age I saw him laboring under the I saw him laboring under the Fallen condition of man broken home no instruction no guidance I saw that little boy go through adolesence no family devotion prayer you know when you look at that then I really realized well yeah how how could I went the right way you you and you set children in atmospheres of unbelief how can you hold him to a message standard but in in my mind I was holding myself to a message standard without Mage standard being there and it it gave me um it gave me uh it it unlocked something in me and I don't know how to explain it um I I was I was talking to Brother Kyle about it the other day and uh he said he said brother he said uh I just saw the video video on that about a some entrepreneur some you know big businessman he said uh some famous guy and he said yeah he said he said uh he was being interviewed and the interviewer asked him said uh who who mentors you and the man said this is going to be strange but I do and brother car said he said the man said that he he he puts a business meeting every month with himself and he he writes down questions and he answers them now that may seem crazy but I promise you it works because a lot of times it's our perception it's our vantage point and a lot of times we got so many things things cluttered up that block our vantage point that we don't see clearly and you have to be honest enough with yourself to step back and look from a different vantage point and I promise you when you look you're going to see things that you don't like but that's the whole point those are the things that you have to deal with listen friends I want we we we can't stay in this building forever we got to go this world is is falling apart look young people you may not have a year two I don't know how long you got but listen get your focus right if you got some if you got some junk on the inside look csel yourself be honest with yourself look you know what and it's okay to to go to Mom and Dad and go hey I'm struggling yes cuz a lot of times we put this pressure you got look you you you got a big youth youth group you know 5060 strong but sometimes it can be so strong that a weak one is like oh man but listen them 50 60 strong is dealing with the same problems you dealing with yeah you know I I spent years [Music] years I'm just going to say it you know when uh when the Lord brought me back and uh and I came to this church and God started pouring out his blessings I told the Lord I said Lord I'll be a fool for you and I'm in it with every every fiber of my being I'll be a fool for you Lord and makes me nervous that camera but I I don't you know not that I don't care but I just don't want to be taken wrong you know what I mean still got that projection just as a joy it's just there human beings but you know um I'm just I I'm just going to get real with you you know I I I told I I said said to the Lord I said Lord I said you know I coming back it was like Lord I I want to I want to use every every opportunity that I have to make sure that I'm right and I I said Lord I said if I'm having problems if I'm having problem with something I can't overcome something I said I'm going straight to brother Chad thank you brother God Rest y'all need to repent and and you know the reason why cuz we CU listen the whole point is I'm not talking about brother Chad I'm talking about the office that he holds yes and that's the way God designed it am and you have to submit to the way that God designed it I'm not talking about legalism bondage I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about headship in a perverted way but I'm talking about knowing that when you go to that office that's God's going to speak to you because you have confidence in the God that's over that man and that's the channel God chooses to use you have to have confidence in that cuz cuz the thing of it is I spent so many because here's the problem you know we can I don't feel like taking my Jack I throw the towel because we become Preacher Man we get the Persona and then there's and then there's the problem I can't tell my pastor that because and you know what this time I said Lord I said m m no cuz to me if there's something in me that would destroy my Ministry oh please destroy it yes it needs to be destroyed it needs to be crushed I mean cuz to me if I can't be honest and transparent with my brother and sister what's the point of standing here you understand what I'm saying but but the thing of it is friends I spent so many years like under this like cloud of trying to figure out life because uh in this message there's so many different facets and movements and you know what I mean you got authoritarians and you got Ley that it's authoritarian you got you got lukewarm and you know what I mean and then you listen to the message and then you look at the message and you're right you know I um see things things can happen in your childhood that that that can lay such a burden on you and I I'm can I go just a little bit longer is that okay please is that all right there may be look you may there may be with some little one that's that's that's tore up right now so just you old ones you pray for that little one amen cuz I I've been I've been crying out to the Lord the whole service on whether I should go this or not but now here we are you know for grow growing up in a in a in a in a broken home uh you know my parents my dad was a Believer you know came to the message that's probably about 6 years old 7 years old and you know he's a he's a Marine not was you don't say the Marines was Marines he's a Marine yeah you don't to get that wrong so and uh but I mean he is he's that man 75 no 77 years old 75 he's more than 48 7 75 years old he ain't but like 58 about 130 about 140 lbs I'm still terrified of it but I love him he he he's my hero but you know this dads have that fear that they put in you you know and you just but but my on my other side my family you know they my mama she she she just she needs the Lord my stepdad as well but you know I I grew up in a home where um pornography was at Arms Reach from six years old and uh you know the first uh the first drop of alcohol I ever had was was uh probably about first or second grade watching Friday Night Fights and so when you grow up in that kind of atmosphere you know it it um it ingrains something in you you know you uh you before you even hit the age of accountability you've been and you don't have no anchor that's why that's why I Look to You old ones y was my anchors see see cuz ultimately you said brother Gabe the Holy Ghost is your anchor well yeah I understand that but I like god with skin on it you know when the Thunder is rolling and the lightning is flashing I like a god with skin on it I'm I'm secure in who I believe in so I but but to me you know you you look at the oldtimers and they they've been I love seeing the old one there still got a smile on their face you know cuz you see something real and it gives you courage to keep on [Music] going but you know I dealing with that type of Lifestyle you grow up all that just being ingrained in you and listen uh you know Satan knows what he's doing because I I'll be honest with you it was easy to give up alcohol and drugs in comparison to the lust of the flesh because it's a natural part of life but Satan gets in there and perverts it I hope you know we speaking in the mixed audience so I'm trying to be careful but the thing of it is Satan he he sets the Trap and then he has a way of using the shame to put you in bondage you know when when brother Brandon would would come in in this sermon Angel of the Lord he would say he would say when I'm getting ready to expose the devil you ought to see the look on the people's faces he says because Satan knows he's going to be exposed and and here's the thing if if you look if you look differently on me after tonight I'm okay with that cuz I I know it's it's not a good thing but all all I can tell you is is that Deliverance it it does something to you to where you can look back and go maybe I can help somebody else that's in that bondage you know what I mean like CU to me friends God's changed me in such a way that I know have words to express it but that's what I'm trying to tell you look young people look there's too many people here somebody's struggling with it I'm sorry friends you can't you can't put out a phone with some kind of bikini or you know I mean to me sometimes I just I'm just a amazed that when I see young people fing out cell phones it's like man cuz you know when I was a little boy you know you had to you had to find something you had to but now boom and then and the thing of it is grown men don't have the ability to handle it how's a child going to have that strength to do it there ain't a filter in the world that listen my wife and I don't went through all kind of filters trying to find the right one and they got loopholes in them come on friends but listen we have the thing of it is is what happens in young people curiosity catches them and Satan knows how to work and then what happens is watch he slips it in and and the moment you fail now it's instant shame and the thing of it is is they can go for years laboring hiding afraid tormented under the guilt and shame of it I know what I'm talking about but when you when you when the grace of God comes to you and you and you see that Liberty that just a tender hand of Jehovah I don't I I to me friends I wish I wish listen little ones old ones look Brothers listen you Brethren listen if you're struggling or something's going look be honest with God Amen humble yourself and say Lord I got a problem yes I got a problem Lord I'm struggling with it that look the the thing of it is is it's not going to be alcohol that deceives you this is not going to be you know them legalizing marijuana and now all of a sudden you're tempted to when you go to the gas station that's not that's not it friends it's something that is a natural part of life that Satan has crept into and perverted it in such a way and he's made it so readily accessible that even the female gender is struggling with it proven fact science to tell you that listen we we it it is you want to talk about a pandemic and but the thing of it is look when you hide it there's no Deliverance but when you confess it Satan loses yes his power and it's the hardest thing brethren for you to humble yourself and look at your wife and say I messed up but I want to tell you there's Freedom like you've never felt when it happens you have to be honest not only with yourself but your family with your brothers with your sisters you understand what I'm saying look the whole point of it is is we're a body yes amen we're a body and and listen hey when it's all said and done if me sharing this but you know I may never stand before you again and that's fine but if I can help just one to me it's worth it all because I know the Temptation and and unfortunately it's in multitudes of pockets and it and it and it starts all so subtle you know and and I I could only imagine if if I was a message boy and then messed up how am I going to counsel myself then cuz I know better well then here's you want me give you the secret you got to be honest with yourself and God and say God I don't have the Holy Ghost amen oh friends listen don't deceive yourself and be living some kind of perversion talk about you got the Holy Ghost you're born again I mean come on now listen friends the Holy Ghost puts that thing under bondage that thing that don't have come on friends you got to be honest with yourself and say Lord I need something more than what I have but the problem of it is is we try to we try to build some kind of facade to make it work and it don't you have to be honest with yourself and you have to be honest with others and say God I got a problem or Dad I'm struggling or wifey listen this is what is going on and I don't know how to overcome it and I tell you when when you make that step of honesty and transparency it'll give you a freedom and a liberty like you've never felt because God's word is true amen and he said if you would confess he's faithful and just to forgive and that's not just confessing to him as confessing to whoever you done it against well not even something that says maybe you're a young person I'm not I hope you understand I'm not I'm not confessing I committed adultery I and I wouldn't be here right I been went to Brother Chad and I'm not qualified you understand what I'm saying I hope you understand I'm just saying here's the thing it's been years ago since all this happened I just want you to know I'm I I feel so burdened for people cuz I I know what that bondage is and it's I'm not I hope you understand this ain't last week that this happened I'm just it's a freedom friends and to me it's like you don't ever hear nobody talk about these things things and it's like you can't tell me like the elephant in the room you know what I mean and it's like hold fast no no no there cannot be people that listen ain't every way ain't everybody is ready Rapture Ready and right so so there's problems but the thing of it is is we have to be honest and we have to we have to say you have to have that conversation with your family and say I used to be there but God delivered me I'm ashamed to have to confess this to you but I'm not ashamed to confess the delivering power that the holy spirit gives and and you know what um like I said when it happens to me it it doesn't matter what happens tomorrow cuz the Lord Jesus he is my tomorrow you know what I mean like no matter what happens in life to me I I've come to a place to where there's there there's a settledness in my life that I've never felt on this measure before and and and to me I'm at a spot where it's like Lord I want every I want everybody to feel this you know what I mean I mean I mean when you when you when you have that reality of God it's like it's like everything that you've heard on the tapes is real in your life you understand what I'm saying I mean it's like I mean it's like to to maybe for me it's such an extreme of of my past and then the now but it's so overwhelming but to me I look and I think I don't know how you tick in your mind and in your heart but to me friends I'll be honest with you when I'm sitting in row five it's all I can do not to bust praise God and to me it's like because it's real it's not emotion it it's a life that pulsates and you God you talk to God and God talks back and God helps you overcome something and whatever you're struggling with you have the ability that whenever you're dealing with it on the job you can see Satan come at you and you can flip the script on him and he's left speechless and you walk away like thank you Lord oh man you're so good right to me friends that that to me that's the whole point of being an overcomer that that that we as grown men I don't you know it used to be all about being a tough guy and you know trying to be uh hard and but but to me listen I I I can't help but to hardly listen to a a a a song and just weep I'm I'm driving on the way to work and on the way home weeping you know just the the presence of the Lord so sweet and and I'm thinking th I if if if I can feel this way at the ending of time what in the world is heaven going to be like yeah oh my friends and if you if and if and if if you don't feel that way and you got all these burdens and all these problems listen there is a fountain you can go to there is a refuge there's a place of hope that you can I I promise you look if if you don't know how to get there then then then then then talk to Mama talk to Daddy look if you're a grown man and you don't know how to get there talk to talk to our pastor somebody somebody can talk to One find one of these old oak trees but but but run get there as fast as you [Applause] can don't don't don't sit there in a in a in a halfway feeling friends I'm not talking about you got the amen loud like brother Gabe I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is the joy bells of God ought to be flowing in your life in a way that's so special to you that that when you're on the job when you're at home when when you're by yourself whatever it may be wherever you're at and Nobody's around and you're three states away the joy bells of God is still going off amen maybe I'm uh I don't know to me it just uh is a um it's a beautiful thing to be a [Music] Christian and I am sorry um if I uh wasn't supposed to go this way um but to me I can't look at you without being honest I just I just I'm not one to put on airs and if something's on my heart I just have to say it I don't know how else to be I don't I don't know how to be anything but just me and this thing called life is is been a a journey but it is it is so marvelous to have been afforded an opportunity at the grace of God and all I can do is share to you my vantage point of it what I've seen and the beauty that it holds and and and and hopefully you see that same Beauty and I'm not crazy but if if I am then pull me aside and say brother Gabe you're crazy you need to get on this road but but you understand what I'm saying I mean uh it's good to be a Christian and so um I uh I appreciate your patience with me tonight and I I hope um something was said that helps um You Dig a Little Deeper and maybe just over turn one stone in your life and be honest with yourself and raise a little higher and if and if and if one of yous can come to that spot then praise God God I appreciate it and I I pray that God would give you Grace all of us to look and make sure every stone is overturned and we've walked the pathways and cuz I tell you when we get on that other side I don't want no problems I want to make sure everything's settled and I have a pure heart I stand before the Lord Jesus on that day saying Lord I did the best that I could I did the best that I could when I lay my head on that pillow every night I don't want no problems I want to have a free heart and being that free heart I just spent so many years without that free heart that I I just worry that somebody's laboring under that and so um I just want you to know that there's freedom and and there is a reality to Jesus Christ am could you stand with meall gracious Lord me just bow before you and just want to testify of your grace and your mercy has been given to us in this Dark Hour life in itself is a burden is what your Prophet said and we're so thankful Lord that you come to us and show us a more excellent way and your great Holy Spirit deals with us in so many angles to help us pack that burden you give us rest you give us peace and passes all understanding you give us an anchor and a refuge in the time of storm Lord my life our lives we surrender to you every day Lord we want to surrender in a greater way and Lord if you give us a tomorrow I pray that the grace would be there to help us surrender more you see the needs Lord and I pray that your Holy Spirit would walk the aisles and deal
