he's going to stop here just briefly tuesday night through thursday morning but he's going to have time to minister for us on wednesday night so we're looking forward to that so pray for him as well i also want to say it's good to see brother mike sister sonja allen god bless it's good to have you here and sonia's parents the locks god bless you brother brian your wife it's good to have you here again you're always welcome amen these are old friends amen not because you're old just because we've been friends a long time amen you can't get to be old friends without you know amen god's good let's look at exodus chapter 17 together and i'd like to take a title today finishing a commission through humility and submission finishing a commission through humility and submission and this this bible study surprised me a little bit so i'm excited to look into it exodus chapter 17 verse 8. we catch the in this exodus journey we're here in the first exodus as the children of israel come out of the land of egypt they've been delivered they've crossed the red sea they're now in the wilderness journey and we find them here in verse 8. it says then came amalek and fought with israel and refed them and moses said unto joshua chooses out men and go out and fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and her went up on the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses's hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and aaron and her stay stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nisi for he said because the lord has sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation i mean god bless you should take your seats amen so i want to look at the the last two or last three verses of this passage we we find that the children of israel are coming in the exodus journey and this is the first time that they're attacked in the journey god is leading them out he's moving them to the promised land and as they're going through the land amulet comes down to fight against them and we know god gives them a tremendous victory but he but he tells moses to write in a book verse 14 write in a book for a memorial in a book and rehearse it into joshua he's going to rehearse it to joshua because moses is not going to take them into the promised land but joshua is amen so he wants to write it in the book so as joshua's taking him into the promised land he remembers what i'm getting ready to say he says for i will utterly put put out of the remembrance of amalek from under heaven he said i'm going to completely destroy amalek god took great offense to this attack they become the first enemies of israel and god has redeemed his people god has delivered him with a mighty hand god is taking them to his land to give it to them as an inheritance amen and now they're coming in messing with god's people in god's program and god's line of duty amen and they become symbolic as the eternal enemies of of israel they they're now symbolic as the the enemy of israel and god promises that i will i will wipe out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nessie for he said because the lord has sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation what god is saying i'm not going to forget what they did here but i will fight back against them from generation to generation until i annihilate their name from under heaven god takes offense to somebody messing with his people and his program led by his pillar of fire amen and so there's a there there's a uh let's go to deuteronomy 25 we picked this up in 20 deuteronomy 25 where moses writes this out and then rehearses it again it's over in deuteronomy verse 25 and this evening keep your bibles handy we're going to go to a lot of places in the scriptures deuteronomy 25 verse 17. he says remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of egypt how he met thee by the way and smote behind most of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary and he feared not god the god it takes such offense not to just amulet coming down but the way he comes down he doesn't come and face them face to face but he comes and picks off the weak in the fee boy man he sneaks around to the hindmost and begins to attack israel in their weakness and he says remember what they did amen when they smote the hindmost of thee and all that were feeble behind thee when there was faint and weary and he feared not god therefore it shall be when the lord thy god hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget it god says in exodus i will i will wipe out the remembrance of their name from under heaven now he tells joshua don't forget this when you go and you have peace from all your enemies and you're established don't forget this don't forget what they did amen and when you have rest round about from thine enemies in the land amen he says thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven he said i'll wipe out the remembrance you blot out their name i've come down to deliver my people i'm sending you amen i'll wipe out their their name the remembrance of them from under heaven you blot out their name you see the commission was to joshua and to the israelites amen to fulfill what god had promised he would do he was going to fulfill it through his people and they were to act out what god said i'll do but he's going to do it but he's going to do it in you amen and now abra or moses is telling this to joshua as they're entering the land he says don't forget what amalek did don't forget the way he did and did not fear god and become an enemy to god and an enemy to the nation of israel don't forget it amen and when you have peace round about then you blot out the name of amalek you fight against them you bring this word to pass remember god has put himself in partnership with man and he says you shall not forget it so this is important very very important to god so let's pick this up in first samuel 15. this is the part that i began to look at in depth and i began to become surprised he remember he says we now have peace from all thine enemies round about when you're when you're established when you're set up in the land then you blot out the name of amalek so here in verse 15 samuel was going to come and give a commission to saul saul was now the first king of israel they're now established as a nation they now have a king they now have their land so they come in in samuel chapter 15 verse 1. samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord thus saith the lord of host i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he come up from egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep and camel and ass so he's telling them make an utter destruction because this is what god said he would do and this is what he told joshua and the children of israel to do to blot out their name now they're established now they have a kingdom now they have a king so samuel the prophet comes to the king he says now god remembers what amalek did now you go down and utterly destroy all of amalek in everything that's his possession what's what's what's samuel telling saul to do finished the commission and promised that god made all the way back in the wilderness in exodus god made this promise god established it now god wrote it in a book he reminded joshua when they were coming into the land you're not supposed to forget this you blot out their name amen remember this and now when they have a king now the prophet comes and said read god remembers amen now you go and utterly to destroy and we know the story that that saul only partially fulfills the word let's look at it in verse 7. it says and saul smote the amalekites from havala until the cometh to sure that is over against egypt and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but saul okay so but saul spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and of the lambs and of all that was good and would not utterly destroy them now saul amen was given a commission by samuel and that commission was to fulfill what was told to joshua which was to fulfill what god promised to do this is important to god but saul amen instead of acting out or fulfilling the full commission amen he stops long enough to save some spoil we've looked at this we've looked at this story many times we know the story of the self-will of saul amen but i never realized why god was so angry with saul amen for what saul did i knew it was for exerting self-will not for full obedience but when you see the promise that god had made to wipe out their name the remembrance he put in the book the commission to joshua amen through moses and now samuel reminding him amen this is something that matters to god this is something that's important to god amen god promised to do it and he wants to do it through you amen but you've got to fully obey amen to fulfill the full word of god and now partial obedience has stopped the promise of god this is why god is so angry with saul amen not just because saul amen we see david messed up amen we see all kinds of kings mess up and people mess up and god doesn't rip the kingdom from david because david has an affair with bathsheba but he rips the kingdom from saul because saul saves the king alive and he saves some sheep and oxen [Music] i mean what's worse to murder a man and take his i mean to cover up your adultery with his wife and murder a man or to save a few animals alive to make sacrifice and save one person when we start to weigh these we say why didn't he rip the kingdom out of david's hand but why did he rip the kingdom out of saul's hand amen because saul amen was failing to fulfill god's commission god's purpose god's word god's desire and god takes this serious this matters to god when god tells his people to do something there's a reason he tells his people to do it amen when he told moses i've come down to deliver my people now you go amen and moses started a debate he didn't think he was worthy he said who am i and god had thoroughly humbled moses until moses was willing to recognize i can't do this but then he begins to he begins to argue with god amen until god's wrath was kindled against moses he became angry with moses amen and and you think why he's so angry with moses because he can't get somebody else it has to be moses moses was born a proper child moses was born under a sign moses is the redeemer he's got to get moses he can't get anybody else to do it but this is his promised word a promise he made to abraham that must be fulfilled but he's got to do it through moses he's got to get moses to fulfill the commission you see friends there's a promise for our day but we've got to keep the word of god to fulfill god's promise amen there's got to be a people on the earth that this time around are not going to hang up god's promise amen you think well god said he's going to wipe out the amalekites god said he's going to deliver israel god did say he was going to do it but how is he going to do it he's going to do it in and through man he needs partnership with men he needs man he needs flesh that will go and make his promise come to pass by their yieldingness and surrender and humility to the commandment of god god did not need moses strength he didn't need moses wisdom he didn't need noses his connections or his politics he needed moses that's all he needed was the vessel and he supplied the rest he had to get a vessel who would say be it unto me according to your word amen he didn't need anything moses had he needed moses he didn't need anything that mary the virgin had he needed mary and he doesn't need anything you've got he just needs you amen he'll supply the rest if you'll just yield and surrender to his word [Music] this is why god is so angry with saul because it's his promise to wipe out the name of amalek he promised that he would remove the name of amalek from under heaven and now he needs salt to begin to utterly to destroy the amalekites and instead of fulfilling the commission to the letter he stopped short to gather a spoil look at verse 16. then samuel said to saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord has said to me this night and he said unto him say on and samuel said when thou was little in my own sight this is an important statement friends when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribe of israel and the lord anointed the king over israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed he says wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the lord i want you to just pay close attention to the language because this is going to become important later we're going to see this again he said when you were little in your own sight when you were humble when you were so bashful at the day of your presentation to israel you hid behind the stuff amen because you were so shy and bashful to be presented to the people that's when god chose you and he's re there's an inference in the language he's inferring remember brother branham said that god condenses his truths he's inferring that that's the way you were supposed to be he's reminding him of what what you were when god chose you you were little in your own side god didn't say you were nothing amen amen i mean that's obvious without god we're all nothing but he reminds him you were nothing in your own sight that was the original condition that's when god could call you that's when god could take you when you were little in your own sight and obviously now he was not little in his own side he had become so puffed up that he thought that he could change the order of the word of god and it would be all right he got so lifted up in pride and he got so full of himself amen that he thought that he could tamper with the commandment from a prophet and that it would be okay with god because he was chosen he was called he was anointed he was the king of israel he was a goodly man he was powerful he was head and shoulders above the rest amen he had just had a great victory amen it surely it'll be all right if we save a few of these sheep and make a sacrifice surely we can save ag as a trophy surely where have we heard shirley before say if anybody ever introduces you to that woman surely run away not shirley ping she's good surely when somebody starts introducing you to shirley turn coat and run amen when now was little in own in thine own sight was thou not made head of the tribes of israel brother branham says in the message influence he's speaking of the the holy cherubims that are around the throne of god he said see the one over his feet he covered his feet with his wings covered his face and with two wings he was in action he said the one over his feet covered humility watch this servant now before god his face covered in reverence his feet covered in humility yes and very conscious be very conscious of your littleness that's where saul should have stayed be very conscious of your littleness all of us is trying to be some big somebody i'm dr so-and-so and great so-and-so of so-and-so you're nothing that's right you're nothing if you want to know how great you are put your finger in a pool of water and pull it out and find the hole where you put it in there is nothing there and that's what we are god can do without us but we can't do without him who are you see being conscious of how little you are the way up is down he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalts himself shall be abased this is a principle we find in the entire scripture he comes to the message humble himself he says you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down always if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him before him that's really power so what's really power real power is not demonstrations of gifts that's not power real power is being able to conquer yourself and bring yourself subject to christ the word that's real power amen that's what amen the denominations can't do that's what the world over humanity cannot do they cannot conquer self they cannot bring this self-willed self-desiring lustful flesh and subject it to the word of god and humble submission but real power that's what real power is you see me you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god in it now let me read read a little further that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise now he says it doesn't have to make a lot of noise it can make a lot of noise there's nothing wrong with noise noise isn't the problem decibel levels i like a little noise it's nice to hear people say amen shout and praise god for the word amen i like it it's not the level of noise noise doesn't get us anywhere and noise is an indication amen the the power in the church is the ability to humble themselves to the word of god humility to the word of god whether it's loud or quiet the decibel levels don't matter right the decibel leverage is just the response of the people who's in the room amen but the human real humility is humbling ourselves before god and just letting god work through us let's look at verse 27 back in samuel 15 verse 7 15 verse 27 and as saul turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and rent it this is uh a saul grabbed a hold of samuel and read it in verse 28 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou all right he's going to give it to somebody that's better than him so what does it mean to be better than saul is he gonna have to find somebody taller bigger stronger nope he was the strongest the best fighter head and shoulders above he was a goodly man and he was he was out of a a he was a powerful his father was powerful so how's he going to find a neighbor that's better than you amen we know the neighbor is going to be the little shepherd boy amen the one that's better than you is not going to be taller more powerful better at fighting the one that's going to be better than you is the lad tending his father sheep carrying a harp singing songs he's not better amen by appearance he's not better by power he's not better by natural abilities he's better because he's humble before gone he's still little in his own side amen so there's a couple phrases out of this passage that i want you to hold on to one is that he flew upon the spoil he flew upon the spoil and god was so angry with him that he flew upon the spoil and got distracted from the commission to utterly destroy why didn't you utterly destroy but flew upon the spoil so he got distracted with a reward got distracted with the spoil and didn't finish the commission to utterly destroy and uh i want you to remember that when he was little in his sight he called him and then the last thing is that uh he's going to find and i want to get the exact word in here out of verse 28 he's going to find somebody that is better than thou better than now these phrases are going to come back in a very interesting interesting way let's go back one chapter or two chapters here to first samuel 13 and verse 11. and we're going to find a uh uh an uh correction that samuel brings to saul when he failed before to fully obey he didn't wait for samuel to come before he offered a sacrifice he offered a sacrifice before samuel showed up contrary to samuel's instructions and here's what samuel says in the correction samuel 13 verse 11 and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou cometh not within the days appointed that the philistines gathered themselves together at mitchmash therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering and samuel said to saul thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over the people because thou has not kept that which the lord commanded thee god would have established his kingdom forever if he would have just obeyed everything god told him to do that's all he had to do all he had to do was obey everything the lord told him and his kingdom would have been established but now there's a prophecy that your kingdom will not be established but he'll anoint another captain then when he failed to fully uh destroy utterly destroy the amalekites and flew upon the spoil and and saved ag alive now is the time that he rent the kingdom out of his hands and gave it to one that's better than him better than him a man after god's own heart better than him a man after god's own heart hold your place in first samuel and turn with me to acts 13. what does it mean to be better than saul and to be a man after god's own heart acts 13 holds the answer acts chapter 13. 21 acts chapter 13 verse 21 and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will what does it mean to be a man after god's own heart to fulfill all his will what made him a better man than saul that he would do all god's will better man and more moral we never have a story where saul committed adultery and murdered one of his own men to cover it up but he's better not morally he's not better and strength and power he's not better in his ability with armor and sword he's better because he'll just obey god amen and when he makes a mistake he'll repent amen he'll repent and lay before the lord and expose it and and be free from it amen but saul is constantly elevating himself over the word of god and david is continually placing himself under the word of god this made him a man after god's own heart that would do all his will who was a better man better than saul let's go back to first samuel 15. verse 7 15 and 32. then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and ag said surely the bitterness of death is past and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless shall saw thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed a gag in pieces before the lord and gilgal then samuel went to rhema and saul went up to the to his house to gibba gibia of saul and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel here we have samuel doing what saul failed to do and kill agag but saul we know saul failed to utterly destroy the malachites because if we go to first samuel chapter 30. let's go there quickly first samuel chapter 30 just a few chapters over first james chapter 30 is a story of the amalekites coming and raiding david's camp and taking away the wives and the women and the goods and it says i'll just pick up one verse in verse 18. and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives so here we know that all the amalekites are not dead amen he wiped out the amalekites in that region from havala to this he wiped them out he saved ag alive but then samuel killed a gag but there's still a malachite somewhere amen he was supposed to continually fight till he utterly destroyed but he stopped to fly upon the spoil and now there's still amalekites out there in other regions amen that have not been destroyed and now david is fighting with the amalekites so we know that the amalekites continued on because saul did not fulfill his commission and they become an enemy an enemy to israel now i want to pick up this story in a strange place i want to pick it up in esther so if you'll go with me to the book of esther what i became stunned with and what i became shocked in is the parallel between the story of esther and first samuel 15. i i begin to actually begin to be shocked and be stunned at the parallels between the story of saul the commission and the failure amen and and then the story of esther and mordecai and the similarities begin to become striking to me and so i want to go through some of those esther chapter 1 verse 10. on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded muhuman and bisthan harbanan big sun bags the zether and carcass the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of alhazarus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so the king answered toward all men that judges the law and i'm not going to continue reading i'll stop right there but he begins to ask them what they should do and they said put her away amen for she's disobeyed the word of the king and she'll set an example for all the other women amen that won't be subject to their husbands so put her away and he puts her away amen he he puts her away and banishes her from the kingdom and then they give him instruction to find another virgin amen to replace her and i want to look at this commandment here or this this suggestion in verse 19 said if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no no more before the king azaris and let the king give her royal estate and to another that is better than she we heard that before didn't we he was going to rim the kingdom from saul and give it to one that's better than thou and now he's rending the crown from vashti and he's going to find a another wife that's better than she and what was wrong with vasti vashti was beautiful vasti was a queen vastly was in the king's court vashti refused to obey the the word of the king now they want to find one that's better than she amen she was already beautiful i don't know that they're going to be able to find one that's more beautiful because she was beautiful and fair to look upon amen but they got to find one that's better than she what would be better amen the most beautiful would probably be equal to her in beauty but this new one has to surpass her and be better than her not in beauty amen not and and royal dress the king can provide all of that but one that's got to be better has got to be one that'll obey everything the king says now hold your place in esther and slip back to first samuel with me first samuel chapter 9. remember the similarities are striking first samuel chapter nine verse one first samuel chapter 9 verse 1. now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abio the son of zeror the son of bacharath the son of aphea a benjamite a mighty man of power he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people so this is where saul comes from he comes he's a benjamite his father's name is kish he's a man of power mighty man of power and and saul is goodly above all of the others in israel let's go back to esther now let's go look at esther chapter 2 verse 5. now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jared the son of shemii the son of kish a benjamite he's in the same line as saul in the same family as saul let's keep reading who had been carried away from jerusalem with captivity which he had been carried away with joconia king of judah who whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassah that is esther so hadassah is her original jewish name which means myrtle tree your name's changed to esther which means star so hadassah is going to have to go through a change amen to become this queen and she's going to have to go through a name change to become this queen she's going to have to go from being church to bride to make this transition so she brought up from what so he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter so his uncle's daughter is his father's brother got that squared away i didn't lose anybody his uncle's daughter would be his cousin his first cousin his uncle's daughter is his father's brother which makes hadassah who will be esther in the lineage of benjamin through kish right in the line of saul the same bloodline remember the title finishing the commission through humility and surrender saul failed by taking his own idea but god in esther is going to finish the commission he laid out an exodus in the promise but he's going to do it through humility and surrender amen so let's keep reading so he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful who mordecai when her father and mother were dead took her for his own daughter amen let's go down to verse 12. i just want to look at before we read verse 12 we know the story really well so i can just hit the highlights we know esther's now taken in they're searching the whole kingdom for fair young virgins to take in amen to purify to take him before the king whichever one the king chooses and names by name will become the replacement for vashti and he's looking for one that's better than she amen she failed by disobeying the king so there's got to be one who's going to be better than she now they come into the through the the house amen of the virgins they come into the house of the women and haggai the chamberlain is going to be the keeper of the women and he's in charge of the purification and getting the women ready to move on amen and we've preached this before we typed haggai with the prophet of god on this day amen who's here to dress a bride amen he's here to clothe the bride in the word amen and prepare her for the meeting so now let's look at this in verse 12. i just want to hit a few points now when every maid's turn was come to go into king azaris after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women i want to look at this the the this six months with oil of myrrh in six months with sweet odors she went she was taken from her home she was hadassah she had a certain identity she was a jewish she was hadassah she was going to be taken into the group of women to be presented to the king under the care of haggai and through this she goes through a purification process and and here's what brother branham said remember it was first six months with myrrh i want to read to you out of matthew 26 6. you don't determine there but out of matthew chapter 26 verse 6. now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at me but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to poor when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble you the woman for she hath brought a good work upon me for for yea for yea for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she hath poured the ointment on my body she did it for my burial she did it for my burial verily i say unto you whos wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this this that this woman have done be told for a memorial of her brother branham picks this up in december of 1963 and god's gifts always find their place he said now myrrh myrrh was anointing of the death and jesus says this anointing always poured on me she anointed me from my burial from my death and brother bam says myrrh was anointing of the death we find in saint john the 19th chapter the 39th verse that going to the funeral service of jesus when mary and them went they'd taken this myrrh to anoint him with because he must be the servant of death for jehovah somebody had to die that was a service that had to be done for god and nobody was worthy to do it but god himself so bring the myrrh showing that with the deity and with the service that he also was anointed with myrrh that this deity had to put to death in order to save the imperfect one so he shows us that the anointing of myrrh is an anointing to death it's an anointing to a burial with the anointing of myrrh and and we we have this in john 19 hold your place in esther and jump with me to john 19 which is the scripture that brother branham is referring to the gospel of john chapter 19 verse 38 we're going to read a passage out of here and a passage out of mark john chapter 19 verse 38 and after this joseph of arimathea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besot pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight then took they the body of jesus and wound it and lin and clothes with the spices at the manner of the jews to bury this is the scripture brother bran is referring to when he says myrrh is an anointing to death myrrh is an anointing for burial let's look at mark chapter 16. mark chapter 16. verse 1. mark 16-1 and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and solomay had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came into the sepulchre at the rising of the sun so here this word sweet spices is actually the word aroma in the greek aroma sweet spices a perfume a fragrance amen it has a counterpart in the old testament the counterpart in the old testament is a word that that means it's a word called bessem which means perfume sweet sweet smell sweet odor and that was the spice and the mixture spices that was pointing to the anointing oil that anointed aaron when he went into the holy of holies so the sweet spices amen were mixed with the anointing oil and he was anointed with the sweet spices to go into the holy of holies but the anointing of myrrh was for the anointing of death according to what the prophet taught us and according to the scriptures and and i just want to uh look at this again in esther chapter two esther chapter two verse twelve now when oh not twelve yeah now when every mate's turn was to come to go into king azaris after she had been 12 months according to the man or women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to it six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for purifying of the women hadassah in order to come to the king has to go through death she has to be anointed with the anointing of death six months with the anointing of myrrh which is anointing for burial which is anointing of death and she's got to die to hadassah to become esther she's got to die to her thinking she's got to die to her own ideas she's got to go through a time of purification that has the anointing of death upon it and then she moves out of death into another anointing and this is the anointing of sweet aroma or sweet spices which is the same word that's used in the mixture for the high priest because now she's going into the inner chamber behind the veil to meet the king and become one with the king so first she passes through the anointing of death then she passes through the anointing of sweet aroma amen so that she could enter in behind the inner chamber this is the same path we have to take we have to come through the anointing of death with the anointing of murder to completely die to self amen to give up all our ideas and give up all our past traditions and give up all of our thoughts and die out completely under anointing of death and the house of the women under the care of haggai the prophet for this age and then let there come an anointing amen another anointing amen like was upon the high priest to go enter into the holy of holies and become one with the king amen praise be to god let's go on and read a little bit further now then thus came every maintenance of the king whatsoever she desired this is so beautiful then thus came every maintenance to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house whatsoever she desired this is the one place haggai had ordered their care had ordered their ritual baths their purifications their anointings the oil haggai hadn't got the right mixture in the right time and the right amount of six months of this and six months of that he got everything the way the king wanted it laid it out got the women purified had cared for them whatever they were supposed to have he took care of it but this is the one place he says you can have whatever you want and your choice will dictate what's in your heart god has never taken away free choice he's never taken away free moral agency even when at the in the exodus they come into the promised land god brought him out with a mighty hand he took him all the way through the wilderness journey with signs and miracles and wonders he brought him into the promised land and they're his he redeemed them he paid for them and he's bringing them into his land that he's giving to them he did it all and now he comes and joshua says amen choose you this day you think god god paid for them god redeemed them god cared for them god delivered them god fought for them god carried them through the red sea god carried them across jordan god did everything for them you would think god says you're mine do what i say and no he says choose you this day whom you will serve but as for me in my house we will serve the lord god never takes away free choice because your ability to choose indicates what's laying in your heart then when it came every maiden came time for them to go into the king whatsoever she desired who has given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house verse 14. in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shashkaz the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she recalled by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed when it was her turn to go each of these virgins they had all went through a purification process they had all gone through the house of the women that had all gone through the hair care of haggy eye but he says when you go into the king you can go according to your desire you can choose whatever you want to take until it came to esther remember he's looking for one that's better than vashti he wants one better than vashti and when it was esther's turn she required or asked for or wanted nothing but what haggy i had appointed there's another thing that i found amazing when i looked at the search the word appointed in the concordance it came out the word almar in hebrew and it says to say to speak to utter so when it says that she required nothing only what haggai appointed it really means she required nothing only what haggai said only what haggai spoke amen she doesn't need her own doctrine she doesn't need her own idea she only needs what's laying on those tapes amen what the what was spoke by haggai is all that she required amen i don't want my own idea i don't want my own thought from the house of the women i want to pass through that purification i want to go into the holy of holies and i'm going to go in the way haggai said amen the way he spoke praise be to god amen he's looking for one that's better than vashti god was looking for one that was better than saul okay now let's keep reading she required nothing but what had he had the king's chamberlain the keeper the woman appointed and esther attained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon there so esther was taken into the king as azaris and to his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tibith in the seventh year of his reign 10 7 revelation 10 7. amen 10 and 7 makes 17 17 is the number of victory in the bible she went in on 10-7 and esther's the 17th book of the bible [Laughter] this is how israel gets victory this is a book of victory this is victory over the amalekites this is victory over amen the fulfillment of the commission the fulfillment of the word victory how is how are we going to get victory through this humble little woman that is only going to do what haggai said praise be to god verse 17 and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti when he saw her come she came from death unto the anointing to go into the holy of holies and she took with her none of her own idea none of her own thoughts none of the influence of all the other women she only went according to the way haggai had said what he appointed what he spoke and when she showed up everybody in the king's house showed her favor because those in the king house knows the king's mind and when the king saw her he loved her above all the all the women and he chose her over vastly he had found one that was better than vashti because this one came according amen to the way haggy i said come and she didn't take anything of her own she did it exactly the way it was spoke so that's the way i want to approach god not coming with my own little tradition and my own little doctrine and manipulating what the prophet said and that was his idea i just want to come the way he pointed amen the way it was spoke i don't want to require anything else i just want to come that way after i've passed through death after i've got a name change after i went from an earthbound myrtle and to a star amen one of the seed of abraham passing through death coming into an anointing for the inner chamber and taking nothing of my own just what hacky i had spoke that made her better than vashti brother brahms says in the marriage of the lamb from 1962 esther was to become a bride so she didn't want none of that of the adorning of the world she wanted to go in through the king just like she was she adorned them she adorned themselves like the pentecost the women ought to with a meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new fame dangled things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when this esther come into sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble meek spirit he said that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it how do we know she had a meek humble spirit because she didn't require anything only what haggai appointed let them adorn themselves with that kind of spirit not only the women but the men too adorn themselves with that kind of spirit then you're becoming ready for the bride sweet reverent esther made her heart clean further down in the same match he says esther purged her heart before god walked up with a meek and humble spirit the church that's going to be the bride of christ now remember esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king and the women today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she's got more numbers she's the best dressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you'll miss it a million miles if you're depending on that it's a sweet kind reverent now i want you to catch the way he says this a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word that's very specific friends a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word reverent to the word you can meet somebody that's ever so sweet you can have a co-worker or a church they're sweet as pie nice always want to do something for you but they will not subject themselves to the word of god that's not the character he's looking for that's human sweetness amen that's a that's a nice temperament that somebody got genetically amen they're kind they're sweet they're nice we like that kind of people hopefully the world's full of them amen but that's not the one he's looking for he's looking for one that's kind and sweet and reverent to the word [Applause] [Music] it's kind this sweet kind reverent spirit to the word of god washed by the water of the word and the word in you it's awashing praise god that's what made esther different that's why he chose esther over the concubine they took their own idea they take worldly adornment they took worldly ideas she came the way haggy i had spoke she heard what he said she took it the way he said it she went in that way she had a sweet kind humble reverent spirit to the word that's what he's looking for what will make you better than the denominations what makes you and i better than the denominations are we smarter far from it are we more in number do we have more about nothing the only thing that's going to separate us from the ones who've been rejected amen is a sweet reverent spirit to the word amen ones that will reverence his word that will subject himself to his commandments one that will believe the prophet that he sent in this day and not tried to adorn themselves with something different but just come adorned upon the clothing of the word amen that the prophet of god said let this be the crowning of my ministry to clothe a word a bride for the rapture with the clothing of the word amen subject adorned with the word that god had used this prophet to clothe his bride let's look at esther chapter 2 verse 20. we're going to look at the spirit brother brad is talking about esther chapter 2 verse 20 esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like is when she was brought up with him mordecai was her her headship and she was taken from mordecai and went in to the king's house of women under haggai but she would not forsake the headship of mordecai she was subject to mordecai and now she's been chosen to be queen she's queen over a province that spans amen 127 provinces a kingdom spans 127 one of the most wealthiest kingdoms that's ever been on the earth she's now queen amen and she's still subject to her headshift amen this is the spirit this is where brother brennan picks this up he doesn't just make this up here the king loved her king kind sweet humble spirit it's evident in the scriptures she had a sweet kind humble spirit she was still humble and submissive to the headship that she had been brought up under and now and she was submissive to haggy either keeper of the women now she's submissive to the commandments of the king she's the one that he wants praise to be the god brother brahm said in the message look from 1963 the way up is down he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalts himself shall be abased see we must humble ourselves not try to know too much just know one thing don't try to know too much there's no one thing focus everything else out of the way and look unto christ and who's christ the anointed word for this day if you don't know how to write your name that don't have one thing to do with it just focus your heart to christ and his will and watch what happens that's the reverence and humility that he's looking for in this day out of his bride one that will focus amen to christ his will and his will as his word and then just see what god does one that'll trust god that if i do it his way he'll do what he promised to do when we begin to do things our own way we're testifying that i no longer trust god to keep his word because now i've got to find an alternate way to do something other than what he commanded and that's how all these other women were that's how vast he was vashti was just like saul she had gotten lifted up because she was a queen she was in royal apparel she was in a position she was in a house her own her own house amen she had everything going for saul was a king over his own kingdom and many had been lifted up he had everything going for him but he did not obey the full word amen but vashti did not obey the full word both of them rejected and both were found another one that was better than them and the one that was better than them was one that would humble themselves and take instruction let's look at chapter 3 verse 1. after these things did king ahazerus promote haman the son of hamad detha the aggite do you remember the name of the king that saul kept alive ag this is a descendant somehow don't ask me how i don't know but this is a descendant somehow of a gag this is an again this is a malachite and you ask yourself why did mordecai not bow before haman now when the king come by mordecai had to bow before the king there's no way that mordecai is going to be a keeper of the door and shusham the palace and the king come by and ha and mordecai and not bow so it's not that mordecai being a jew won't bow before any man he had to bow he was in the employment of the palace he had to bow but he would not bow to this one individual and that individual was haman because haman was the enemy of the jews haman was an amalekite he was an agagite amen he was the one that god promised that he would wipe their name out from under heaven and that he would utterly destroy that's the one he told joshua not to forget but to destroy it's the one he told saul to destroy but saul left off to run after the spoil and now now there's two people rising on the scene amen there's an esther humble submissive meek and and sweet amen out of saul's line and now there's haman out of a malachi's line out of agag's line amen and they're going to face off once again and it's not going to be by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord she's going to win this victory over the malachites by surrender by humility by meekness my reverence not by force and by power and by showing off and by showing what she can do and becoming arrogant she's going to win this battle by staying submissive and humble and reverent this bride never has to lose her sweet humble reverend spirit to the word to defeat the devil in this day she never has to get arrogant she never has to be boastful she never has to demonstrate all that she can do and claim great powers and wonders she can stay sweet humble kind and reverent to the word and god will do what he said he would do wipe the remembrance of it off the face of the earth amen let's jump down to verse 10. i want you to catch a wording a phrase here verse 10 and the king took his ring from his hand that he given to haman the son of hamadaytha the agagite the jews enemy who were the jews first enemy when they came out of egypt the amalekites who's the jew's enemy here haman the agagite of the same lineage amen let's look at uh chapter nine let's skip over the chapter nine i want to catch this wording again chapter nine verse twenty four chapter nine verse twenty four because haman the son of hamadatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had casper that is the lot consumed them and to destroy them all so his title is haman amen the agagite the enemy of all the jews amen let's look at esther chapter 8 together so familiar with the story but esther she has to approach into the king and and she doesn't know how it's going to go she has to approach unto the king and mordecai and structure to go into the king because haman you know he has this plot this wicked plot and he gets this deceives the king and letting him make a decree and get to kill all the jews and but he doesn't disclose to the king who it's going to be that's going to be destroyed and through his wicked plot his cowardly plot through his cowardly plot you ever heard that term cowardly plot just when he's about to the the uh uh whatever fulfill his cowardly plot he come and snatches her away and here haman is just about to fulfill his cowardly plot any and he has a decree sign that all the jews can be destroyed and all their uh all their spoil can be plundered amen he's going to have a great victory they're going to kill them all he has the gallows built amen for mordecai because he hates mordecai because mordecai won't bow to him and because mordecai's of saul and he's of ag i tell you friends god never forgets this is hundreds and hundreds of years later amen this is hundreds of years later in a different land altogether god does not forget when god makes a promise he doesn't forget when god gives a commission he doesn't forget when god's going to deliver he does not forget we may forget but he doesn't forget what does he need he needs one man totally surrendered in his hand and he can do many things he can shake the whole world what's he need a surrender he needs a surrendered vessel [Music] so we know that the queen has a banquet of wine and invites the king and look at the whole approach to the king esther never becomes arrogant esther never becomes brash she always approaches the king in humility she always approaches the king and humility humble subjection to the king and she comes amen to the king not knowing if she'll be accepted but she's willing to lay down her life because mordecai instructed her to because mordecai said she's willing now she says you pray i'll pray i go in if i perish i perish why is she going because mordecai told her to go she's always submissive always humble always reverent and she moves forward not knowing if she'll survive when she comes to the king the king accepts her by extending the scepter and she says if it please the king not i demand you and you better and you but if it pleased the king and if i found favor in your eyes would you come to a banquet that i've prepared see when the king sees esther come something happens in the king if you read this amen we know the story you can read through it it's only nine chapters but when you go and you read he wanted vashti to come to him when he called and she refused he wanted vashti to come to him he was enjoying himself he was feasting and he wanted and she refused to come to the king but here without him asking esther reverently and humbly approaches to him and when he sees esther come in the royal apparel humble and submissive and reverent he's moved he extends the scepter and he says what is it that thou want i will give anything up to half my kingdom like what a statement for this king to make why would he make a statement like that because he had a queen that wouldn't come at his bidding and here she comes of her own free will because the king wants fellowship with his queen amen the queen and then she says would you come to a banquet of wine i prepared for you and immediately said is make haste and make ready amen i couldn't get vashi to come to me not only does this woman come to me she wants me to come to her she wants to entertain me she doesn't want me to entertain her she wants to welcome me into her house she wants to entertain me she wants me to find welcome in her place and her abode amen god is not looking for the kind of bride amen that comes to god's house amen to get some benefits and comes only when she wants to comes to church and comes to get a reward doesn't come when she doesn't feel like it he's looking for a queen that'll come to him because she comes to him humbly reverently and wants him to come to be entertained in her house because god wants fellowship he doesn't want a queen to stay separated he wants a queen to come to him and ask him to come to her he asked her again in the banquet of wine what do you want up to half my kingdom listen this was not he's not the mayor of gomer he he is the king ruling over almost all the inhabited world at that time and he's going to give her he's got a kingdom that goes from india to ethiopia it'll give her up to half the kingdom she's going to be a joint heir with him because he wants a woman that loves him that comes to him and invites him to come to her and in her house she exposes haman we know haman ends up hanging on the gallows that he prepared for mordecai but then there's another decree that goes out because esther introduces mordecai to the king and mordecai has been given the the ring that was on haman's hand and he tells esther and mordecai you can now write a new decree and they begin to write that the jews can now defend themselves and i want you to read what's what's written here esther chapter 8 verse 10. esther chapter 8 verse 10. this is really important to catch this and he wrote in the king azares name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by post on horseback and writers on mules and camels and young dromedaries wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people in the province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey so now he tells them he signs a new decree the king gives them a right you can now fight back against those that want to destroy you you can kill them and their little ones and their women we're going right back to what saul was told to do only in this decree he says you can take the spoil you can take the spoil now they go to perform that the day comes and they begin to defend themselves and they they they the in all the provinces they slay so many they stand up and fight and shush in the palace they stand up and fight but let's look at verse 15 of chapter nine no not chapter nine yeah chapter nine i want to look at verse 12. the report comes back that the ten sons of haman are dead that they've killed five hundred and shushan they've killed so many more in the provinces and now verse 12 of chapter nine says and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in shusha in the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is i request further and it shall be done he's saying you say this is now the third pull in esther whatever you say it'll be done what do you want what do you say and look at what esther says then said esther if it pleased the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and the king commanded the to be so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged hammond's ten sons haman's ten sons what did she want where did saul fail he was told to utterly destroy he fought one big battle and he flew to the prey before he chased the rest of the amalekites amen but they asked esther what do you want now esther says let us do it again tomorrow amen what are we going to do utterly destroy don't let us stop now let us keep going till we eradicate the amalekites let us do tomorrow like we did today what is she doing she's fulfilling the commission to utterly destroy and the next day they killed 300 in shushan but but then look at this this is interesting verse 15 for the jews that were in shushen gathered themselves together on the 14th day also of the month adar and slew 300 men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand let's read the next verse but the other jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey this time they passed the test they were given a king's decree amen but from from the writing of mordecai from the seal of the king that you can go and defend yourself you can fight you can take the little ones you can take the women amen this is the commission that came all the way back out of exodus you can come now to that and you're allowed to have to pray but none of the jews touched to pray they went back to the words of samuel amen when samuel said don't take anything don't touch anything amen leave it all alone it's all the amalekites don't mess with anything that's a malachi none of the jews in this day touched the prey they overcame the temptation they had permission from a king to do it but they still didn't do it amen do you see the similarities between first samuel 15 and and now esther this is god finishing the commission how through a humble little woman amen and a group of people that'll just do what the word said do and when they were able even to take the prey they went back to the original commission that was left off and they said we're not going to touch anything that's the amalekites and when they had a great day of slaughter the king says to esther what do you want to do next and she says i want to do it again tomorrow because there's a commandment to wipe out their name from under heaven there's a commandment that was given to utterly destroy the amalekites let us do tomorrow like we did today you can do it this is the last mention in the bible of amalekites nowhere else in the history of the jews that i've seen can you find amalekites or agagites god remembers what does he need power strength beauty wisdom he needs humility and submission he can supply everything else but he needs somebody that'll do all his will and brother branham said his will is his word in christ the mystery of god revealed he said the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denominations won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did eve know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall this one won't touch the spoil she's ordained hallelujah she's ordained not to fall she won't fail she is predestinated to him in the message the god of this evil age the prophet says we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she's not like eve that she's not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word adam's bride was tested by the word christ bride would be tested by the word but this day god is going to remember all the promises he's made like in esther's day god never forgot they were in captivity they were away from the homeland they were they were uh they were a people that had learned to learn to uh build homes and live in a foreign country they were separated from the temple they were separated from jerusalem separated from the inheritance amen they were living out in existence there but god did not forget what he said in exodus he did not forget the commission in deuteronomy 25 to joshua he did not forget what saul had told samuel told saul to do god never forgot and god finally got a humble little virgin girl just like god thousands of years later did not forget what he said in genesis 3 the seed of the woman and he got a humble little virgin girl from nazareth who would just say be it unto me according to your word what's he need today he needs a humble little virgin girl that'll move from the earthly to the heavenly from hadassah to star that will pass through the anointing of death and die out move into an anointing of the holy ghost to go into the inner chamber and go according to the way haggai said one that will stay submissive to mordecai one that will only do what haggai said one that will love the king one that will be reverent to the king and humble to the king and one that won't forget the word amen and when she has an opportunity she'll even sacrifice herself to go before the king and remember that the amalekites have to be utterly destroyed and there'll be a people on this earth that won't touch the spoil this time god is going to have his esther he's going to have his star and i say with all that's in me god i want it to be me i want to be surrendered i want to be submissive i want you to fulfill the commission and the promise through a humble vessel god i have nothing to give to you but myself i have no gift to offer but myself i have nothing that i can do for you amen because there's what can you do for god there's nothing i can't help give i can't do anything i can't give god something he doesn't already have all i can give is myself my vessel my mind my heart my energy my time just give myself holy to him and let him pick me up and do what he's promised to do in this end time with a humble submissive vessel that's our desire let's be like esther let's be better than vashti let's be like david better than saul how can we be better to be after god's own heart to do all his will god bless you let's stand together musicians if you'll come this time i was so astonished looking at the bible and seeing the parallel and recognizing how faithful god is to his word he fulfills his word in such an unexpected way who would have expected when he told saul to utterly destroy the amalekites that god was going to finish it through a little woman in a foreign land whoever knew that when god made the promise in exodus that he will not forget what amalek did in hill and he'll erase their name from under heaven who would have dreamed it would have come through a little virgin girl captive in a foreign land god's ways are so much higher than our ways he never does it the expected way but he always does it according to his word and here we are the virgin girl in the foreign land with the opportunity to surrender all i said god fulfill your word in this tabernacle of flesh right now let's bow our heads to him lord jesus we thank you father god your word is so rich and it's so pure lord every shadow every type every character every story in the bible is demonstrating this mystery of the seventh seal what you've reserved for the end time your plan and your goal and your purpose lord it's being known it's being made manifest story by story shadow by shadow type by time character by character and god we keep finding ourselves in your word we find ourselves in these stories these types and we find how faithful you are to keep your word god if we can just yield you can perform your word if we can just surrender you can do the miraculous if we can give up you can take over i pray god that as we give up now that you would take over you would heal us lord and deliver us from ourselves lord deliver us from our old carnal thinking and our traditional understanding of the word and bring us into the pure revelation of the pure worm and give us a surrendered heart to lay down our lives for this word to give up to give out to not hold anything back but to totally surrender and watch you work a mighty victory in this day as you fulfill your promise for your promised word says in romans 16 that you the god of all peace shall brew satan under our feet what do you need you need a willing vessel you need a surrendered vessel so that you can bruise satan under our feet god we're yielding our vessel now in jesus name take us lord and use us for your glory and for your purpose in this hour in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless your friends for the bin here i am [Music] oh i give all myself to the lord here [Music]
