deep within each of our hearts Lord and allow it to find good soil in US prepared ground Lord and may it bring forth a Bountiful Harvest For Your Glory oh we love you and we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you while we're standing let's turn to Isaiah chapter 7 Isaiah chapter 7. we'll read just one verse in Isaiah and then let you have your seats Isaiah chapter 7 and I'd like to read verse 14. therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel may God bless you as you take your seats amen I just want to say it's been nice to have some of the visiting ministers come through I mean I feel like it's been a long time since I preached him and so it's good to be here I got to get back into the rhythm again but I really enjoyed having brother Daniel come and then brother minnow was a last minute surprise I called him Tuesday and it just worked out and then brother yatsuk we had scheduled for a while so I would never normally schedule that many ministers in together but it just worked and it worked well and I thank God for each one of the brothers and for the nice time we had also really appreciated the men's fellowship breakfast that was a real blessing so we're thankful for all that worked at that all the sisters who pitched in and the brothers who helped it was really nice amen this this last two weeks it's been nice for me to have these brothers ministering it gave me just a little reprieve a little chance to kind of absorb the loss of brother Gideon because that really hit me a little bit hard and so I was thankful for that and God just knows it's good timing and I'm thankful for it but now we're we gotta get back in Action amen now it's time to take the word and move forward so let's turn together to Luke chapter one we're going to pick up this story again in Luke chapter one and and when we looked at uh Isaiah chapter 7 it said the Lord himself shall give you a sign and so this is a promise of something that nobody was going to produce on their own nobody was going to Manifest this or produced us on their own but the Lord himself was going to do this because it was something no human being could do it was something nobody could do on their own but the Lord himself was going to give this sign that a virgin shall conceive and so we we want to look at Luke chapter one together and begin at verse 26 Luke chapter 1 verse 26. and then the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou hell thou are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at a saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God so we we all know this is very familiar to us but here is going to be the Fulfillment of what was promised in Isaiah chapter 7 the Lord himself shall give you a sign and when the Lord himself came to give a sign he sent an angel amen and then that angel carried the message amen and it was the it was the doings of the Lord it was the Lord himself giving a sign and the angel came to Mary and Mary had to receive the words of the Angel and what the angel was giving her was the confirmation of the prophecy that it had been laid down hundreds of years before but it was coming time now for what was prophecy to come into manifestation and the visitation of the Angel was going to tell her not only is it time but this is the place and the places in you so this is what's been prophesied that the Lord himself shall do he's going to do inside you you're the chosen one you're the one who's highly favored of the Lord and now is the time and Mary had to receive the words of this Angel as being the Fulfillment of that scripture amen and it's amazing it's something that she could not produce herself she could not do herself although she has a part to play so let's look down to verse 38. and Mary said behold the hand man of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen see the Holy Ghost is brother REM teaches us as a gentleman amen he will not force himself so Mary's part was to surrender amen Mary's part was to believe what the angel said and to receive it amen and to open herself and allow that that message would pertain to her amen she she no matter how many doubts she could have about her worthiness because I'm sure amen a humble young virgin Amen in a town is a Nazareth I'm sure she didn't feel herself worthy Amen to to be the Fulfillment of the scripture she probably didn't feel herself amen that she she in any ways would be worthy or good enough for or any of those things can you only imagine what she would think but she had to have the ability to say I receive what you're saying about me and she says be it unto me according to Thy Word so she had to have a seat of faith on the inside to be able to receive the word amen an unlikely word fulfilled in an unlikely way to recognize that she is part of the Fulfillment of this word that God himself will do it she can't do it but she's got a part to play in her part to play is say I surrender I agree I give myself to you and so now I'd like to just for a title this evening I'd like to take the title of a private meeting with only two witnesses private meeting with only two witnesses and if you'll remember back the last few weeks when we were preaching we were we've been going down this theme of of the Twins and the births and the we talked about Ruth and Boaz we talked about Mary we've talked about um Tamar and so these things were laying in my heart back then and I never got to preach him and and I I couldn't shake them so they just kept I've kept dwelling on it and dwelling on it so I just want to share the the last bit of those thoughts that I had from before but you see Mary had to receive the word of the prophecy and it's very much the same way for us no matter who we are or how unworthy we are or what kind of Life we've lived or or whether we have skills abilities or don't have skills or ability none of it matters anymore amen because it's something that the Lord himself will do but he must have a willing vessel somebody who will have faith to accept the message and say be it unto me according to your word and so we know that there was nobody around when the angel Gabriel visited her and gave her this commission there was nobody present nobody else heard it she was the only one who heard it and she received it and so now she has had a private meeting with only two witnesses her and Gabriel and and her story is unbelievable it's it's not likely it's not easily received and we know that that that she was rejected amen for her confession when when it became obvious that she was pregnant and it began to show and it began to be declared and even when word came forth to Joseph her espoused husband he was mindful to put her away privately amen because he didn't even he didn't even realize what was happening he assumed what everybody else assumed that she had been unfaithful that this is this is adultery amen and so the Assumption in that day was it was adultery even Joseph's assumption was that it was adultery but he had to receive a message from an angel amen that would tell him fear not to take Mary thy wife unto thee for that which is conceived of hers of the Holy Ghost he had to himself realize that this is of god this is something the Lord himself is doing not even something Mary did this is something the Lord has done so the assumption that day by everybody that this was adultery amen and and Mary held the secret within her heart she knew this was the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7. she knew it because she received the and believed what the angel had told her as a messenger from God she believed it she received it by faith when she received it by faith amen the Holy Ghost came into her and what was conceived within her amen was the son of God and it began to change her life it began to physically change her and and she would go forth and we know testified to Elizabeth before one change took place she had so much faith in what she had heard she went forth and began to testify of what happened and then her testimony was backed up by the change in her life amen but nobody else except Elizabeth and Zacharias and and Joseph and I don't know who else in that day would believe her testimony because she had a private meeting and there were only two witnesses and you couldn't lead somebody else to Gabriel to find out you couldn't put him on the stand and so brother Brahm says this and um in the message birth pains it says but after eight days the mother brought the little baby in wrapped in swaddling cloth it swaddling cloth they didn't have nothing to put on it was a little rag off a yoke of an ox and I'm told that there was swaddling cloth here come here come Joseph and them coming in with this little baby I'd imagine the mother stuck back from a distance with her little babies with needlework and everything looky here see there she is she was pregnant by that man here she comes in that stay away from her keep your distance they still think the same thing do they still think the same thing but Mary with that baby in her arms it didn't make any difference what they thought she knowed whose son that was amen she knowed she herself knew beyond a shot of a doubt where this baby came from amen she knew it didn't come from Joseph she didn't she knew it didn't come from a soldier she knew all of it was lies amen but but what she held in her hand was the manifestation of the promise and it wasn't her it was something the Lord himself had done not something she did something the Lord himself had done and she was holding it in her arms and and I would say this way she had to turn a deaf ear to everything else she heard amen because she can no more prove anything she had no certificate she had no Witnesses she had no way back then there was no DNA test there was no she had no evidence she had no proof she was holding a baby but they would deny the source of the baby so so she had to go by faith and she had to know in herself where this child came from it didn't do her any good to argue it didn't do her any good to fuss it didn't do her any good to try to get together a committee that would believe her and go around and convince the the priest and the Pharisees and the elders and none of that would ever work none of it ever has worked none of it will work today amen she had to stand alone on the knowledge of where this child came from and so brother he says again it didn't make any difference what they thought she'd knowed whose son that was and so is every believer that accepts God's word into their heart I don't care what the systems say you know what it is it's a promise of God it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed with his power you know you know where it's at no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's met God on the back side of the desert in that burning bush to where there's no ecclesiastical system in the world can explain it away from you you were there it happened to you I don't care what the system says you're a witness of it this is where Mary was Mary amen she was she was walking amen through the temple amen going at the Eighth Day for the circumcision and for the offering that must be made then she's carrying the baby in her arms she's holding the very manifestation of Isaiah 7. amen the Fulfillment in her arm what was told to her by Gabriel she's holding it it's her evidence she knows it amen it's her token but it's only a token to her it's a token to nobody else because nobody else believes it nothing she could have said would have convinced them otherwise and she has to walk in and hearing The Whispers maybe she catches little phrases little bits of conversation and she knows enough to know what they're talking about she heard it in Nazareth she heard it in Bethlehem she knows what they're saying about her she doesn't run to them and confront them she just keeps moving forward in the prophecy because she knows whose baby this is the life that she had received was the son of God that life within her began to change her began to she had physical changes in her body no doubt emotional changes as well she began to change and and she knew what was the result of what was the cause of the change she knew when she started feeling funny feelings she knew where it came from she knew when she began to grow and when she began to have different Cravings or hunger her appetite increased or what whatever was happening to her she knew why others around her could question why but she knew why amen and then this life that she had received began to change her amen and I would say uh if I could say it this way to receive the words of Gabriel was voluntary it was voluntary God never forces himself on anybody now God never pushes himself on somebody against their will amen she herself had to make her choice she had the right of free moral agency to accept or to reject what Gabriel was saying and she herself received it that was her choice Amen to say be it unto me according to their word to receive the prophecy but after she received that life the changes that would come to her were no longer her choice it wasn't her doing it it was the life she received now doing it in her amen it was now that life form was changing her physically changing her appetite changing so many things in her life because she yielded to what was told or she received it as from the Lord for her personally and when she took it to herself amen now the Holy Ghost came amen and there was a seed that was in her in her life now and it was the seed of God now coming to life and now growing and it was changing her involuntarily and the life in her begin to change the circumstances around her people begin to murmur people begin to pull away there was accusations then Joseph received a revelation and he would stand by her and Elizabeth would catch it by the Holy Ghost when as soon as the greeting came from Mary the Holy Ghost would strike her the babe that was dead in her would leap to life she would begin to prophesy amen things around her were changing because of what she received Mary wasn't changing them the life inside of Mary was moving everything around her amen there was people taking sides amen some believing amen some disbelieving some not knowing what was going on and then there was a certain position Mary had to come into because there was also more prophecy to be fulfilled and there was prophecy that Bethlehem that a scepter would rise out of Judah and out of Bethlehem would come a governor and so Mary can no more put herself in Bethlehem then she could fly to the moon amen but the life inside of her started changing the governments around her and in line with the word why because she received what the angel said about her and it began to move everything according to that prophecy there were other prophecies linked to that prophecy which linked to other prophecies amen and the word in her was bringing the word around her the world around her to manifest that word and now uh Caesar would get an idea out of the blue to bring a taxation upon all the world where everybody had to go back to the home of their father and because Joseph was of the lineage of David he had to go to the city of David which was when David's birthplace which was Bethlehem so now he's got to go back to his homeland for a senses and for taxation what was moving this life inside of Mary was moving at all now Mary amen and Joseph when she's heavy to be delivered An Inconvenient time to be traveling now she has to make a long journey from Nazareth down to Bethlehem it was probably difficult for her she would have probably never chose to do that on her own but the life inside of her was changing the circumstances around her to put her in position to fulfill the rest of the prophecy how involuntarily oh my goodness we think we have so much control we we really you realize this is something God himself is going to do in our lives God himself has to do it in our lives we can't do it ourselves but we have the power to accept or reject the prophecy concerning you and I and if we accept it and receive it and the Holy Ghost will come and come to life within us the life within us will start to arrange everything outside of us involuntarily people will reject people will believe people will scratch their head and not know what to do all of a sudden plants will close businesses will shut down people will reject things will go good things will go bad everything around us will start to change things we would have never decided to do ourselves positions we would have never taken moves we would have never made amen but all of a sudden the life inside of US starts changing circumstances around us to put us in position for the furtherance of the Gospel so that the prophecy concerning our lives will come to manifestation why because we received what the messenger said about Mary may not have even fully comprehended what was happening to her she may have not put two and two together that now we have to go to Bethlehem she may not have even been thinking about the prophecy you see it's Christ in US that is making a way for himself it's this word that we have received the life of the word has come to live its own life and it's moving things around us sometimes involuntarily because we wouldn't break those relationships we wouldn't we wouldn't uh we wouldn't cause a census in a taxation in our lives but God doesn't God does it so that what's in him will come to manifestation so so his desire that now he's placed in Mary has to be in the right place at the right time for the word and now she must make that difficult Journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem why because he had already purposed in his word that out of Bethlehem the governor shall come and so the same is true for us the word is going to be fulfilled there's prophecies attached to this bride amen and when we receive Christ when we receive the word for our day amen as the angel messenger is coming our day to the seventh angel to come and tell us what our identity is where we are in the scriptures what prophecies to be fulfilled in us when we receive that when we receive it and receive the Holy Ghost it begins to change things inside of us it begins to change our life but it also begins to change the world that's around us we think the world's going into chaos just because the world's going into chaos the world's going into chaos because of the word inside of you that's coming to fullness because there's prophecies that must be fulfilled in this bride there's things there's manifestations there's there's things that must take place that's been prophesied that the prophets told us that's laying in the scriptures amen and the world is going into chaos and governments are shaking and everything's going wild and why is it going wild because there's something in you growing to maturity and there's another manifestation amen because you said be it unto me according to your word because somebody received this word the word's been growing in a bride amen it's bringing the world into a certain condition to position the bride in a certain place for a manifestation we may not even understand what's happening and why we may not even be listen we may not even be able to put two and two together we may not figure out why this is happening and why that's happening why they've changed this law and why this Rule and why this cycle and why why why and why is it coming the the pressure's coming and why are we having to change things and why is all this happening you may not even know why it's happening but rest assured God has a plan in his mind his word will be fulfilled and the life inside of you is moving the world around you to make a way for his own display man because the Lord himself shall give you a sign Abraham goes on to say about Mary said but Mary but Mary as she held that little baby in her arm no matter what any of them said she knowed whose son that was do you know what life it is that's in you do you know it's beyond your own idea are you sure that it's beyond your own idea beyond your own life that is something beyond your own thoughts there's something more inside of me than what there's something more inside of me than the genetics I got from my parents there's something more inside of me than this flesh body I got or this Earthly spirit that I received at my first breath there's something else in me that's come alive and it's not just me it's him and me she knew son this was she could take the ridicule she could take the scorn she could turn a deaf ear to what was being said and keep moving through the scriptures because she knew whose son that was brother sister is not a man or a woman in here that's ever had the Holy Spirit come upon them in a new birth but what knows what that's in your heart let them call anything they want to but you know what you're cradling as Mary moved down to Bethlehem she gets down into Bethlehem in the the time for her to be delivered was at hand they could find no room at the Inn another catastrophe because the Inn is the church could find no room in any church could come in this church and Mr every church was full amen but there was a stable that was available there was a Manger of hay where this child could be laid and no doubt Joseph listen you know the Bible says Elijah was a man of like passions as we brother man was so good at making the Bible live and showing us that people people were people the people of God were people like us with thoughts like us feelings like us and I'm sure Joseph I can only imagine the grumbling and complaining and I can only imagine as he goes to an Innkeeper this is just brother Chad my imagination I could be a million miles from right but I could just imagine going to The Innkeeper and if Joseph was anything like me and he was saying listen sir you've got to have some room any room at all my wife is about to deliver you can't leave us out here in the streets we have to have something and then the man says we have no room we're completely full and what about your bed can we can we have your room and the man says no closes the door can you imagine Joseph saying of all the cold-hearted load down no feeling whatsoever there's no more love in the world not knowing that man was anointed to say no because this lamb that was going to be born couldn't have been in any of those Church systems but had to be born where Lambs were born because this was the Lamb of God Joseph may have never known that any more than Abraham may have never known that the reason he had to go to Gerard and the reason he had to lie about his wife being a sister the reason was so that he can lay in the scripture something for a prophet to pick up four thousand years later to show that there was a body change he may have never understood Sarah may have never known why and she may have always had hurt feelings towards her husband I don't know would you any of you ladies had hurt feelings towards your husband if he lied and would let you go and be the wife of some man so he would protect his own neck I think I don't know I think my wife might have hurt feelings she may never understood why but God was laying it down in the form of a prophecy for our day so you can imagine that that the response and you can imagine the the effect it had on Joseph the effect it had on Mary and his Mary becomes more desperate she gets more uncomfortable all the time amen she's she's pleading with Joseph her help Joseph's pleading everywhere for him and finally they go to the only place that they find and it wasn't great accommodations it wasn't a good place to bring forth a child amen but it was the one that God had ordained and what was happening the life in her was moving everything into place and they didn't even understand what was happening they were coming into the perfect position for the manifestation of the word and didn't know it and as the time came for the Lord himself to give a sign and it came time for this baby to be birthed into this world into this dimension Mary could no more stop it then she could stop the world from turning huh amen praise God why because she said being unto me according to your word she yielded herself to the word she gave herself to the prophecy she believed what the prophet had told her she believed what angel that gave her the angel Gabriel had told her she believed the prophecy she believed that it was her she received it by faith and because she received it it put the whole cycle of Prophecy in the motion in her life the the word in her the life in her was making a way for itself and when it came time to manifest itself she could no longer stop it because she had already received it and when the pains were coming on and she couldn't stop the birth pains because she had already received the word and now the word was coming forth on its own praise be to God I say God show yourself in this generation amen many times along the way Mary or Joseph would have stopped it would have stopped the positioning would have stopped the trouble would have stopped the rejection would have stopped the the move from Nazareth to Bethlehem would have stopped the the the closed doors at every end many times along the way they would have stopped what was happening in their lives not realizing what was happened in their lives was ordained to bring forth the Messiah and when the pain started I'm sure Mary would have loved to hit the stop button but it was too late she had already surrendered to the word now the word was coming forth itself you know I'm so thankful that there's something in us to say be it unto me before everything changed we could have faith enough to save be it unto me according to your word and made the examples that are laying in the Bible be an example to us we don't have to understand what's happening we don't it doesn't always have to make sense and it doesn't always have to feel good it doesn't have to be pleasant it doesn't have to be a beneficial to our flesh amen but what we have received is Jesus Christ amen the word the word is wanting to make itself flesh in Us in this day it's wanting to be birthed out of each one of our lives and the word we received is changing our lives and positioning us into a position for manifestation of further prophecy and sometimes it's got the closed doors and open doors and what's doing it the word in you is arranged in your life and positioning you where you're at and some days are good and some things are good and some things are bad some things are painful and some things are discouraging and some things hurt but with a little bit of biblical understanding vision from the prophecies that have went before us we can understand all is well all is well brother Graham said there's nothing out of cater everything's ticking just right on time with the Son of God Amen God's making no mistakes there's nothing out of order everything is just right closed doors rejection people who believe people agree people who disagree amen the change in government's changing laws everything is ticking right on time it's all fine with me it may hurt I may even Grumble and complain before I catch myself I may I may uh not understand the actions of certain people I may be discouraged by him I may even say something that I have to repent of later but it's the life in me that's doing it it's not me it's a life in me God is going to have his way with each one of us in the fourth seal brother remember says maybe one said why I believe we've waited long enough let's just accept it by faith he's speaking of the Apostles in the upper room the disciples I mean in the upper room that was good Baptist Doctrine but it didn't work with them brothers so then the first thing you know it had to become a reality they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated and when you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same yes you can accept it by faith you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Spirit by faith but then let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he's accepted your faith you see see Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness but God give him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he accepted his faith faith so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something I want to catch that Mary received the Holy Ghost till it did something in her there was a change and the change became more evident with time we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we danced or we got emotional we shouted until we're changed until something actually happened I don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing I want to keep reading brother bam is so good at explaining this in the fourth seal he goes down the next paragraph he says though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity at Prophet me nothing though I could do it see so those things doesn't mean that you have the Holy Spirit he's talking about gifts and signs and one that doesn't mean you have the Holy Spirit but when he the person The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes your personal Savior and changes you and throws your views right straight into Calvary to his this word Something's Happened yes sir something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know it when it happens my brother I'm saying he's saying You must have an experience of the new birth and that experience is something in you changes and it throws something deep within amen not in the mental realm but something deeper throws all of your affections in your heart to Calvary into this word to everything in you once all of Christ and all of his word and all of it your mind might still wonder to and fro your flesh might still craves things here and there but something inside of you has awakened to the fact that all I want is him and this word is my everything until something inside changes to not because you spoke in tongues not because you dance not because you got emotional all of those things can go with it but none of that is that what it is is the Awakening of the seed on the inside the change the quickening power has come to Quicken the seed on the inside amen remember I said I don't care I don't care what form it comes in just so it happened loud or quiet in church or by yourself I mean in your prayer closet or at the altar it doesn't it he said I don't care what form it comes in just so it happens just so something comes alive in you there's a change there's an Awakening until you're changed so you can say my desire has changed I used to not even consider the things of God or I would hear it and it would just be something but now it's become my everything it's not just something I hear and now it's become my life my desire the greatest desire of my heart is to please him the greatest desire in my heart is to hear his word and to live it amen you don't get that with your natural birth your natural birth your greatest desire is to please yourself the natural birth the number one person in your life is yourself but with your new birth the number one person in your life is Christ yourself becomes last or at least it should brother bear says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ and the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see now you joined a church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ and you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon you know Mary knew where this baby came from she knew and though they thought she was an adulteress those accusations were floating around maybe it was her and Joseph before the wedding maybe it was her and a soldier there was all kinds of rumors that were floating around even they called Jesus a Samaritan because they believed his mother amen was unfaithful so now he was a half breed but she could raise her head above all of that because she knew herself where this baby came you know what there may be dozens thousands millions that'll deny your new birth and it won't matter as long as you don't deny your new birth what's detrimental is when you're not sure where the baby came from when you don't know where this baby came from then all those voices start to sound appealing most important thing is to know this wasn't me he came to me it wasn't my parents it wasn't my pastor it wasn't my church it wasn't it was something Supernatural that happened deep within and I'm not the same creature I was I I still I still have problems I still have thoughts that I don't want in my mind I still think of evil things and I still have things that pass through my mind I still have cravings in my flesh for things that I shouldn't crave amen but something deep inside kicked on Amen and it's not what it was before it's something different amen there's a love and a passion and a desire for the things of God so much so that I hate the things in my mind and I hate the Cravings of My Flesh and the message desperations brother bam says now just not no certain evidence he's talking about the token he preached a token that morning in desperations in the afternoon so not not not now just not no certain evidence see brother bear my feeling in your minds you see why will I why will I know he's picking up from the people on the token they're asking how will I know that I've got the token and he's trying to tell him not just not no certain evidence because he was dealing with people that had come through so much Pentecostal the Pentecostal Revival amen and he's telling them not no certain evidence he said you say brother Branham I feel it in your mind you see why will I know so he's catching their question look what were you and what are you there is how you know my that's pretty simple isn't it listen Mary you were a virgin nothing alive inside now look at you how did that happen he came to me I received his word and I was impregnated by the Holy Ghost look what you were and what you are there is how you know what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things just automatically go with that and that's why he's talking about the gifts and the signs those automatically just go with that amen but what's got to happen is something inside of you must change you're not what you were and so Mary knew beyond the shot of a doubt where this life in her came from it wasn't just a thought it was more than a thought can you imagine as Mary she runs to Elizabeth and she begins to share with Elizabeth in her salutation what had happened and Elizabeth amen begins to prophesy I'm sure it was an amazing time but could you imagine if Mary was like any other human being and she would lay in bed at night before she felt the butterflies in her stomach before her stomach began to expand and she would just lay there and she'd be like was it a dream or was it real no it was real could you imagine was it was I just dreaming it or was it real have you ever went back on a testimony in your life a supernatural event and you said to yourself wow that was beyond real but was it real yes it was real it was it seemed crazy that that could happen could that really happen yes that really happened amen but then she began to keep confessing and keep confessing and and what she had received begins to manifest begins to take on form and begins to take over her whole life and she knew what was in her now when the baby comes forth and she's walking amongst the critics and the scoffers and it's okay it probably hurt when she walked by a group of women and she she heard I heard it was a Roman soldier or she heard another comment he just was covering for her I sure hurt would it hurt you but she knew where this baby came there's people who can doubt you and doubt the sincerity of your heart doubt your actions they can doubt your new birth they can doubt whether you receive truth or not they can call you in a cult or say you're following a man or say that you you you received false Doctrine or you're in Oneness or whatever they want to say but you know where this baby came from you know the prophecy that was laying in the word you know what the angel said you know what happened in your heart when he was speaking to you did on our hearts burn within us when he spoke to us along the way and you know what you've received and you know what it's done inside of you that you didn't do yourself let's turn to Genesis 38. I just want to pick up one more little story here in Genesis 38 as we move forward we know in Genesis here in 38 that there's a Judah judah's oldest son takes a wife and that wife's name is Tamar so we're going to be speaking about Tamar again and before Tay marker could sieve seed from the eldest son of Judah he passed away and she was given to the next son but that was the law to bring forth seed for the dead and and he didn't want to do that because he would lose his inheritance so in a selfish way he refused and he was smitten dead and the youngest son now the third son was too young to marry so Judah sent her back to her father's house to play to be a widow to be in mourning and tell the youngest son Sela was old enough and he would give her to him to wife to bring forth seed for the Dead and so while she was there she heard word that Sela was grown but but she was not given to Sila and and she she was not given her rights so we pick up the story in verse 13. and it says and it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to Shear a sheep and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to Timnath for she saw that Sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when Judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned into her by the way and said go to I pray thee let me come into thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said I will send thee a kid from The Flock and she said will thou give me a pledge till thou send him and he said what pledge shall I give thee and she said thy Signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in my hand and he gave it to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him so we we hear the story we know now that that Tamar it it looks like she's playing the part of the Harlot but she's not a harlot what she's doing looks wrong but it's actually right to everyone else it looks like what she's doing is wrong but really what she's doing is right because the law said that somebody must raise seed for the Dead she's within her rights of the law and now if the sons won't do it she's going back to the originator of the Judah line she's going back to the father to receive the seed she she actually knows where she's standing although she looks like she's wrong she looks like listen it looks like she's against the word playing the part of the Harlot but she's actually caught the true revelation of the true word and she's walking in the true manifestation of the word because she knows what the word was given for and it was given to keep the inheritance in the land of Israel and she has a right to that seed nobody else around her would agree with her but she knows what she's doing and it looks wrong but it's right let's go down to verse 24. and it came to pass about three months after that it was told to Judas saying Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the Harlot and also behold she was with child by hornem and Judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt so now we why was it three months later because after three months it became discovered it began to change her life what she had received she could no longer hide it it was becoming evident amen that that she had received a new doctrine become evident that she had received the seed the word the message so you can no longer hide it amen and it comes back to Judah that she's at a whoredom she's believing false Doctrine so he's received the wrong seed from the wrong Source amen she's been she's been lying with other men and no longer believing the Bible you see your story in the Bible and he said bring her forth she'll be burnt this is so interesting now Judah is the judge so in the season that the judge is on the scene look what takes place we read verse 24. he said bring her forth let her be burnt 25 when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are am I with child and she said discern I pray thee whose are these the Signet and the bracelet and the staff and Judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Sheila my son and he knew her again no more and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold Twins were in her womb and we won't go into that but we know the Twins were born in Fair as and zela were born in Fair ass becomes the line of Kings amen and out of pharaohs would come would it would eventually come the Jesse line from Obed the Boaz Obed Jesse all the way to King David would come from this line so God blessed what she did but it was called whoredom she had to bear that reproach for a period of time but when the judge was on the scene and he was going to judge for whoredoms amen she had a token to show she had a token from the one she was pregnated by she had something to show back Amen to the judge and she would say listen she couldn't defend herself she couldn't prove anything she there was nobody else there there was a private meeting with only two witnesses amen her and Judah and Judah didn't know she was there so she had a token to present and when she presented the token to him he realized that it was scarce she's carrying inside of her is from me she's more righteous than I am why because she was keeping the word when Judah was breaking the word Judah was breaking the word and she was keeping the word and what looked like horde and what looked like was wrong she was actually keeping the word and Judah was the one breaking the word and he says she's more righteous than I am and he he gave her a Signet a bracelet a bracelets and a staff and brother Brown never explains what these are so I I don't know I don't know what the correct interpretation of what each one of these are but a Signet is a seal so he gave her his seal which his seal is his identification whenever he seals something a document or something it proves that he's the one who sealed it because he holds the seal and there's not another seal like his seal it's a private seal for Judah which proves that he's the one who sealed the document so she got the seal she got bracelets this translation and bracelets is odd because it's only translated in the Bible here bracelets this is the only place everywhere else it's a cord or lace or a ribbon or something else it is is thread that is intertwined or Accord so don't ask me what it means I'm just telling you that's what it is and a staff and his staff represents the tribe of Judah this is judah's staff remember when they all were contesting the choice of uh Aaron to be high priest amen he told the 12 tribes each of the heads of the tribes to bring your staff and lay it before the Lord and the one that blooms and Buds and bears fruit will be the God's choice what was the rods the rods were representing each tribe and now Judah gives her his staff which represents the tribe of Judah and we know that the tribe of Judah is now going to come from Tamar the furtherance of the tribe is coming from her and she has his seal she has his his band his cord whatever that cord was amen she has all of those things and and the time that she's going to be judged as a amen she presents the token and the token proves her to be righteous holy and pure not a listen and the day we live in there's two vines that have been pregnated one's a and one's a virgin one's a and one's a virgin the false church and the true church have both been pregnant they both received seed and they've both been impregnated by two different sources one from Christ and one from Antichrist amen and how in the world are we going to know amen which one is the and which one is the Virgin everybody says I'm virgin amen I mean the Catholic Church says they're virgin amen the Protestant churches say their virgin we say we're a virgin amen the only way we can do it is show the tokens that we have received and what have we received we received the true revelation of the word we receive the very spirit of God we have his life and we have his word with the correct interpretation of the word and when it comes time to present and we can say we could say it this way amen the one that I'm pregnant by amen gave me this word this is his word this Revelation this word this opening of the seals this revelation of the seven Thunders this this interpretation of serpency this interpretation of water baptism this interpretation of godhead I got this from the one who pregnated me and this life that's in me that's not my life but his life in me I got that from him too when I received this word that's the man who pregnated me and then the false Vine amen when they go to show their staff their bracelet whatever they show however it works amen I'm just showing it as a Time amen when they go to show they say Amen this is my interpretation of the scripture the one impregnated me show me baptism and titles amen show me a piece of fruit in the Garden of Eden amen show me that the the the seals are not open they'll be open later amen that's who impregnated me and by the tokens proves where the seed came from and it testifies that this bride is not a harlot she's not been in Harlan she's been keeping the pure word she's kept herself virgin to one man and that one man is Jesus Christ you realize you have a token to present concerning the life inside of you it's the evidence of the man who impregnated you Tamar you know she has no other evidence she has no other proof where she can do to defend herself how can she keep from being burnt she must present the tokens of the man who impregnated her there was a private meeting with only two witnesses she couldn't defend herself listen friends if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost to genuine true baptism the holy ghost in the soul to Quicken the seed to life you've had a private meeting with only two witnesses you in Christ no matter how much you argue no matter what you try to show amen you show demonstrations and when the false Vine can show demonstrations you speak in tongues the false Vine could speak in tongues what can you do to prove amen that you're not in harlotry to show the tokens of the man that gave it to you the one who you opened yourself to the one who you said being unto me according to your word show the tokens that he gave to you what did he give to you he gave you the true interpretation of the word with Divine vindication he gave you his very life the very life of the word is coming you the life that's in you that will manifest the word and live the word amen that life in you is his life amen it's not like the the denomination say we receive the Life of Christ but the life that they live amen will cause them to ordain women preachers to cut their hair to wear shorts the life that's inside of them will allow them to smoke and go to the movie theater the life that's inside of them it's manifesting itself showing that that life did not come from Christ that life came somewhere else but there's a life in you that that straightens you to the word and every time you're off there's a life in you that brings you back in line with the word into a quick repentance that's not your life that's his life living his word and bringing you back to the word so there's been two groups pregnant and whether we like it or not they're calling each other harlots I mean we don't just say that the Bible says that we can't help it but there's two groups prednated in this day one will bring forth the true manifestation of Jesus Christ and flesh again and the other will bring the manifestation of antichrist and flesh again two groups impregnated and both calling each other harlots what are you going to arrest your soul on I have a true token I have a true token I've been given something by the one that I've received the one that I I've received seed from has given me his staff and he's given me a seal and he's given me his court whatever they represent I don't know I'm not trying to make a direct correlation I'm just showing when when Judah gave with the Signet and the staff and the bracelets prove the chords they proved that this was Jude and nobody else had these things the staff was the the head staff it was a certain staff that represented the whole tribe of Judah it was judah's personalized staff it was not a generic staff the cords that were bound on him was made specifically for him no one else had a cord like him and no one else had a Signet like him or else it would you could you could Forge his signature so what he gave to her were the indications that only Judah could have given this to her what she had proved who she got it from because they were things that could not be replicated they were things that were specific to Judah alone only he had this staff only he had this Signet only he had this cord and what's been given to the bride it's been given to us only what he's had he's had this mystery in the back part of his mind says before the foundation of the world it's specific to him alone amen the revelation of the seven Thunders nobody else had it there wasn't even scripture written to explain it amen he had it all to himself it shows it's been behind the seal amen that it's only his and his only and then the life that he gives to us is his life only not an imposter life what have we received we have received the tokens from our bridegroom that proves the impregnation could only have come from him and not another source but you know Tamar could talk to the world to she was blue in the face they would never believe her but when Judah the bridegroom you understand what I'm saying her bridegroom now he became like a husband to her her bridegroom her husband and her judge now looks at the tokens that's in her possession and he says she is righteous she couldn't defend herself she couldn't prove anything there was a private meeting with only two people but her bridegroom and her judge Vindicated her listen we're never going to prove anything to the world yeah we can try we can try the fruits of the spirit but brother Branham said there's other denominations that have just as many fruits of the spirit we can try manifestations of the spirit but there's other denominations with just as many manifestations of the spirit so what what do we have to prove our innocency to prove her virginity to prove that we're with the word what do we have that nobody else has what do we have that will stand the Judgment what do we have that will declare us righteous no I haven't received false Doctrine no I'm not outside of the Bible no I'm not following after a man you can say that all day long you can say it to your Baptist friends you can say it to your Presbyterian friends you can say it to all friends I'm not following a false doctor and I'm not following a man I'm not off the word say it all you want but there's one who's going to judge and the one who's going to judge is your bridegroom and he's got to look for something that could only come from him not Antichrist not false dog not false system but something that could only come from him and that's his life in his true word now no matter what anybody says Tamar knows where this baby came from she knows and what is she holding she's holding the evidence of the man it came from the evidence that could only come from him not anywhere else Tamar could try and no doubt when when the word came to Judah that she had played the Harlot so no doubt in her Village this was spread like wildfire somebody picked it up and ran to Judah with the news I don't think he was the first person to hear it so there was a rumor mill going and you can you imagine The Whispers when she goes to Market can you imagine the look she gets when she goes to draw from the well she has to Bear the reproach for the seed that she's carrying and she can't convince the ladies at the market she can't convince those that are that are that are the elders in the gates of the city she can't convince those of the weather there's nothing she it's her word against whose you're gonna say I I'm a born-again Christian I'm a True Believer but that's anybody can say that her confidence was not and who agreed with her her confidence didn't come with allies who would stand up for her when she faced Judah she faced him alone she had no Witnesses she didn't even have a character reference all she had was her tokens but they were enough men doesn't matter listen it doesn't matter what anybody else says it doesn't matter as long as you know who impregnated you if you know where the life in you has come from and that it wasn't you it's something more than you something deeper than your mind something more than what you were before amen when you know that and you know where it came from and you have the tokens of the source amen then you don't have to be afraid you don't have to fight you don't have to defend yourself you don't have to argue with them on the street all you have to do is sit quietly and patiently and wait for your bridegroom to say you're righteous you're righteous that's what Boaz said to Ruth Ruth comes and does something that that looks absolutely wrong in the minds of all the people she slips in at night She lays down her alone with a man a single woman she's a widow and a single man and She lays down at his feet and in the middle of the night amen she says cover me with your skirt and he covers her over my if somebody I said before if somebody would have turned on the lights how do you explain this she was subjecting herself to the Kinsmen Redeemer she was trusting in his character to keep her amen and she laid herself at his feet and she surrendered to him trusting that he would defend her he would declare and when he woke up and saw her and saw her act of what she did she says the now I now your kindness in the end is greater than your kindness in the beginning for all the city knows that they were a virtuous woman he's declaring her virtue her strength her her character and he goes and stands in the gate and stands up for her and redeems her until all is done and then it rewards I am so glad that my bridegroom is my judge and I'm so glad that we're in the hour of judgment when the white wig one has come down because when he passes judgment amen there'll be some in this season of judgment that are found righteous by receiving the true seed both of them look like harlots but only one of them is a harness true church in the false Church accusations all over but my when you know whose son this is when you know what life is in you when you know what happened to you and you know that something changed within you and you know you're not what you used to be amen you can say I'm not what I ought to be I'm not even what I want to be but praise God I'm not what I used to be something shifted changed me and through all of my focus away from myself and away from the world and focused me and centered me on Christ and on his word and when that's happened and you've received the tokens of that then you can walk steady in this world not needing allies not needing the masses not needing groups not needing people to agree with you they all can disagree with you it doesn't matter if the whole world disagree with Mary it could not change Mary's Revelation and the joy in her heart that she was the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 and that was coming from her was the son of God Emmanuel is that we've had it good I don't know that we're always going to have it good we've been left alone sure we've been mocked by some we've been ridiculed and we've had persecution but mostly that was friends and family who knew us when we first came to the message we all passed through our struggle and our time being rejected and accusations and you're following a man and still when we testify we get those things and but other than that we've been pretty much left alone I don't know that we'll always be left alone but listen you're not going to convince anybody debate's not going to do it apologetics is not going to do it you're not going to conjure up enough evidence out of the scriptures amen you've got scriptures they've got scriptures we're going to have to walk confidently in the revelation of what the Angels told us we're going to have to have absolute confidence that this isn't me this is him and me we're going to have to walk these last steps until the change of the body and in walking that we're going to have to hear murmurs and we're going to have to whatever looks and accusations and called harlots and called whatever amen it doesn't matter if we are solidly confident in where this baby came from amen then we have nothing to fear amen because I know the source amen it's not my mind it didn't come from William Branham it didn't come from BCF it came from Jesus Christ this is none other than the very life of the Son of God living inside of me [Music] and I have the tokens the evidence to prove what man impregnated me the same one who opened the seals is the same one impregnated me and William Branham didn't open those seals the lamb is the only one that can open the seals Jesus Christ opened those seals and he who opened the seals is the one who impregnated me Paul says in Acts 24 13 neither can they prove the things wherever they now accuse me but this I confess into thee that after the way which they call heresy so worshiped by the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets I love Paul's answer in the way which is called heresy he wasn't living in heresy they called it heresy but it wasn't heresy he said in the way which is called heresy is the way I worship so I worship the god of my fathers but then he says believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets what he said I believe everything that's in the Bible the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the god of my father believing the Bible and right now amen you may think that that that we've received doctrine of devils or following after a man you may think that I'm following blindly after William Branham and the way that is called heresy is the way I worship the god of the Bible believing everything that's written in the Bible Paul was saying my faith what I believe came from the scriptures they call it heresy I call it the word of God they call it whoredom I call it virginity amen and Paul listen Paul wasn't saying now you know I'm not a heretic now listen to grip and listen Felix come on give me a break here no he's saying hey they call it they call it heresy the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the god of my father believing all things that's written in the Bible he was confident who he met on the road to Emmaus he knew where that Pillar of Fire was and what that voice spoke to him and when he received the revelation of the word and this in the in the wilderness of Arabia he knew it was Christ who gave him that Revelation and opened this word to him and he knew where he stood the way that is called heresy it's the way I worship the god of my fathers believing everything that's written in the Bible call it heresy call it idolatry call it hoard them call it false Doctrine call it following a man call it whatever you want I can't say anything to convince you otherwise but thank God you're not the judge you're not the white wigged one you're not the one who decides I'm so glad there's another judge on the scene these days I'm so glad Melchizedek is come I'm so glad the white wig one is here I'm so glad the son of man is coming our day and there's a judge present who can judge what's true and what's not true amen because when he when he calls for me to defend myself I'm not going to defend myself I'm going to show him the tokens of the man who impregnated me the one who opened the seals the one who gave this Revelation that's the one I've received [Music] it's not me it's him a woman can't impregnate herself takes a man which man the one that opened the seals the one that revealed Revelation 10 1-7 that's the man let's not try to defend ourselves there's nothing that you can do to defend yourself what evidence do you have what proof prove to me you're a bride show me documentation and evidence aren't you glad I'm not your judge you don't have to convince me you only have to convince the white wigged one you know brother Branham told a story I don't have time to read it but I want to finish with this thought he told about the son of the man who owned the armor company who owned the ranches in Texas and he sent his son to fetch a wife and he went down there and they put on a big pump and a Big Show and big Western outfit and and they had a dance and after a couple of days that he got tired of all the dressed up women trying to get his attention to be his wife he went outside and he saw a little washer girl go out and throw a dish pan full of dishes next day he thought oh I'd like to talk to her and he goes out and he goes around the crowd to where he'll bump into her and he bumps into her and she drops her head she's so ashamed she got clothes on she's been working she's Barefoot and brother man talks about she you know talks about this story and he says you know why I'm here don't you and he said I'm looking for a wife and he says I'd like for you to be my wife that little girl couldn't believe her ears she was the cousin the outcast she was the washer girl the one they gave all the chores to she never got invited to the party she never got the new clothes no other boy on the ranch ever paid her any mind they kept her so busy and so working and so downcast she never dreamed when the probably when she heard that he was coming and saw the fuss she probably never even dreamed that she would even meet the man but now he came and found her she didn't find him he found her because he found something in her that the others didn't have and she may not even realize she had it but he saw character in her and he asked her and she says I'm not worthy and I'm no good and he says no I want you to be my wife and I'm going to go away and prepare a house and and I'm going to come back at a certain time and I'm going to get you and you know what the strange thing is she believed him as crazy as that sounded she believed in and he went away he got no she got no more word from him but she believed him something inside of her connected with what he was saying and she believed him she believed him to be a man of character that would keep his word she believed if he made a promise he'll keep his promise and then she Faithfully began to scrimp and save and buy what she needed for a wedding day and she got a wedding garment amen and she she would display the wedding garment amen and all her cousins laughed at her and said you silly kid you think a man like that would want a girl like you he would take one of us over you and brother Venom is typing this with the denominations and the little bride and he's saying there's no way you're unlikely and they laughed her to scorn and they mocked her amen but this little girl she had no confidence in herself she was the Barefoot washer girl that was ashamed to look him in the face but her confidence was in his character to keep his word amen to me do you understand we don't feel worthy we're not worthy we don't look good enough not good enough have enough wealth have it we don't have anything that would attract him other than character and that character came because he placed it there we've got faith to believe him because he planted a seed of Faith inside of us we have nothing amen we look in the mirror and we're worthless amen we consider our position and there's no way amen but there's something inside of us that believes what he said is the truth and I'm so confident in him not me I'm so confident in him that I'll put every effort I've gotten to being prepared for the day he comes you see it in no time was this little girl ever confident in herself she didn't buy the dress she didn't buy the all the flowers she didn't buy the shoes she didn't buy everything she needed for her wedding she didn't buy it because she had confidence in herself she bought it and prepared because she had confidence in him she was showing her faith in him and in one place Brother Bear tells a story the main one that I picked it out of is the Sixth Seal which I thought was fascinating and the purging seal the tribulation seal and here he says I've had men watching you when he finally comes to pick her up he said I had men watching you and I've seen what you went through and I've seen how you held true we wonder why things happen to us why we get mocked and why this and why so much difficulty and why so much rejection amen he's wanting to see how much confidence you have in him how much confidence do you have in him amen they they begin to laugh at her and say why would he want a girl like you I don't know why he'd want a girl like me but he said he did whatever you have to offer him I don't have anything to offer him then why would he want you I don't know why he wants me she didn't have to defend herself she didn't have anything to prove amen now this man has everything to prove she has nothing to prove because it's not her word it's his word so as it goes through time now and prepares and brother man starts talking about it the Day's coming and she gets all ready and everything that's prepared for her wedding she has it on and we know the scripture says the bride hath made herself ready why has she made herself ready amen not because she's worthy or if he thinks anything of herself she's taking the wedding garment that's been given to her by the Elijah Ministry amen and she's put it on and she's prepared herself because she is confident that what he said is the truth so she's she's prepared herself and they're laughing at her you're prepared he's coming to take you to Chicago how you're going to be a rich woman and a rich house and she stands there waiting not arguing not fussing not trying to prove anything not vindicating herself not pointing to all her achievements and all her Merit and all you see the difference between her and the worldly Church you see the difference between her and US sometimes it was never based on her her ability her Merit her wealth her status it was always based on him and now we're standing here waiting for the translation of our bodies prepared prepared and we've joined in him in Union Amen in a wedding supper were married to him living for him United to him amen looking forward to the translation of our bodies amen and and we're prepared we've done everything he's told us to do we're walking in his word displaying his life it doesn't matter what anybody says because this never was me and it never was about me and I've got nothing to prove I'm worthy of it I have no merit to show you I have no accomplishments to prove it I can't go through a list of things that I've done to show you that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I have nothing but his word I have nothing but his invitation I have nothing but what he has confirmed in my heart I don't have anything else to show but then now it gets down to an hour 30 minutes they're laughing and laughing five minutes one minute she never flinches she never runs back in the house in tears saying I thought it would happen by now she never throws down her flowers or takes off her garment she stands there completely ready because she's got absolute confidence something in her knows that that man won't lie at the last minute when they're mocking their loudest they hear the wheels coming down the dirt road he jumps out of the Chariot she jumps off the porch past all of the all of the cousins and runs it to his arms and he takes her into the Buckboard and he drives her to Chicago much to the surprise of everyone else you know there was two people who weren't surprised that man and that woman she knew he would be there she knew he wouldn't lie to her he knew she knew he wasn't playing games with her she knew he would keep his word tell your friends we're here in the last bit of time this is the last stretch and I want to be found faithful with all the Garment on Amen standing in my position amen because I know that that man didn't lie to me I know that Jesus Christ is not playing with my emotions he's not playing games with the work amen I can't look in the mirror I can't give you any reason why he would come for me I can't tell you anything that makes me his bride only thing I have is faith in what he told me to be absolutely the truth amen I have the token of the word in my heart knowing that he didn't lie to me but he told me the truth and now I'm prepared not so that I can gain Merit I'm prepared because I believe him I'm dressed in the wedding garment with the flowers in my hand walking the way he wants me to walk not because I'm trying to earn my bride ship but because I believe that what he said about me is true and his word won't fail we have nothing to prove we can't prove anything sometimes you can't convince another member of the Bride that your bride sometimes your friends are with supposed to be your friends deny whether you're bride or not what's that today followed on me sometimes your family will question you sometimes people in your own church WIll question me sometimes people in other churches will question you and then doubt your bride ships sometimes people in denominations are people at work or whatever they'll deny what's that to thee follow thou me believe the word as something in your heart come alive at his invitation do you have a token of the man who impregnated you do you have life on the inside it's nothing to prove what makes you bribe what makes you bride don't start going through all the things that you do I dress right and I I don't smoke or drink and I go to church and I think don't start that What Makes You bride is he chose me before the foundation of the world [Music] well it gives you such confidence you're right because he told me personally there was a private meeting with only two witnesses and that private meeting was between me and Jesus Christ and what is the new birth brother Branham it's it's Jesus Christ revealed personally to you if you've had that meeting there's no other Witness praise God the judge was there nobody on Earth matters nobody around you really matters he's the one who called you he's the one who defend you he's the one who declare you righteous no arguing no fussing no defending no pointing to foolish childish evidences that anybody else can replicate I spoke in tongues and I had this experience and it was like fire come all over me and listen that can be replicated and that may be part of your experience and genuine too but it's the word that he's revealed to us and planted in our hearts and it's the personal connection between a living Jesus Christ and us and the Soul Realm and something in US is quick into life and we've changed it's that's it friends that's the private meeting with only two witnesses and I can't prove that to anybody else but I don't have to I can't vindicate myself I can't prove myself I can't convince anybody else but I'm convinced and you know what it's not really based on my Merit anyways because he came to me when I had no merit he chose me before I could do it good or evil he chose me before I was a good church member he chose me before I dressed right he chose me before I talked right he chose me before I thought right so now I'm basing it all upon the one who gave the promise in his mind not mine his how do you know he's coming because he said so yeah how do you know you're one of them because he told me so what makes you think you're in the back part of his mind because he revealed it to me I don't have any other evidence I can't prove it to you you don't have to believe me but I'll tell you one thing the translation of my body will testify I can't prove it to you I can't convince you I can't make you agree you can disagree it's out of my control there's nothing I can do about it and I'm not going to waste any energy trying to convince somebody one way or the other amen but I'll tell you one thing's absolutely for sure for the true bride of Jesus Christ the translation of the body will be the Vindication of whose bride you can argue we can make claims we can boast we can claim this I mean claim that but the translation of the body is going to be the final stamp on who is bride and who is not and a lot of people who convinced other people is going to still be here when the translation takes place so I'm not worried about convincing other people the one person who's got to be convinced is me the one person who's got to be convinced is you say may God do that in each of Our Hearts Let's Stand Together musicians if you'll come it's funny brother Brandon met an angel in a cabin just him and Gabriel or him and an angel I don't know if it's Gabriel or not but him and an angel just two of them nobody else you know what we believe it Mary met an angel I wasn't there were you there do you know anybody who was there do you know anybody who was alive when Mary was alive that can tell you that they even saw Mary pregnant you never saw it but you believe it I believe brother Baron broke to the spoke to the storm but I wasn't there how is it that I can believe that because when God spoke to me I believe it when God told me that this is the the ministry of Malachi 4 and this is the ministry of Revelation 10 7 that this is Elijah this is the seventh angel when God revealed that to me I based everything else on God's Merit that what God told me is the truth and so all the rest of it's truth too when God revealed to me that this is the word of God and it's every bit true then I believe Mary met Gabriel I have no way to prove it but I believe Mary met Gabriel when God reveals to you that this is the truth when God reveals to you that the ministry of William Branham was the Bible coming to life was Malachi was Revelation was the seventh angel when God convinces you then it's not hard to believe what the seventh angel said because I'm not even basing it on the Merit of the seventh angel I'm basing it on the Merit of the one who told me that that's who that was praise God let's bow our heads and pray so we don't preach all night Lord Jesus we thank you God your word means so much to us Lord it's our very life it's very our substance it's it's everything to us God your word says that faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is the evidence I don't have any other evidence I can't prove anything really I don't have enough evidence I don't have enough artifacts I don't have enough of a mind or even time but God my faith that you have given to me your faith that you have planted in my heart is the evidence that these things are true faith is the evidence of things unseen Lord I thank you for giving me a seed of faith for there's no way that I would ever believe these things to be true if you had not put something in me before the foundation of the world something that could respond to you when you would call something that could answer back or something that would believe when you would say to me you're the one that I'm after you're the one the scripture is talking about and something in me regardless of the circumstances could say that's the truth and I could say be it unto me according to your word oh dear heavenly father I pray that you would grant that privilege to all of your children Lord God if there's any here who have not yet had that seed quickened to life I pray God that you would brood over them that your Holy Ghost would go to them and begin to brood and when they would feel your presence near that they would open their heart and receive you Lord and you would come and Quicken that seed to life God let each one of your bride have that personal testimony and that confidence Lord that something in me changed Lord something shifted there's a life growing on the inside that's the word of God Lord I pray that you would keep us Lord keep us focused keep us centered keep us aligned Lord with your word and your promise for this hour help us not to be distracted by accusations let us not be distracted by by all of these things but let us stay focused on what you said who you said we are who you revealed to us we are may we hold steady and have faith and let the word that's in us move everything into position Lord and help us not to get nervous or afraid or anxious or angry but help us to relax and Trust in what you've said and allow it all to work to bring a greater manifestation of the life that's on the inside we love you Lord we believe you I believe you I believe your word is true I believe you're not like a man that you should lie but you're God and you tell the truth and I trust your character and I trust your Merit and I trust what you told me to be absolutely the truth and I trust what you've revealed to me for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to me but you father have given me the revelation of who this Christ is and I am so confident and that you've told me the truth that I'm putting all my confidence in you and trusting you to keep your word Lord help us to stay faithful and true help us to hold the tokens in our hand and have confidence that what you've done what you've begun you'll finish you'll complete in Us in this day bless your people bless your children keep us Lord as we go into this world and let us be light stored in a dark world and use the light that's coming from us to attract other seed to yourself Lord may you accomplish in us your purpose in this end time in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
