TRANSCRIPT
========================================
They believed Moses was a prophet of God. They believed that Moses, Amen, brought the plagues. They believed that through the voice of Moses, God delivered. They believed all of that. But the problem is they did not believe Moses's message. Cuz Moses' message was not, "I'm parting the Red Sea." His message was not, "I'm bringing plagues." His message was, I'm bringing you into the word. I'm bringing you into your heritage. I'm bringing you into your land. Amen. And now when they go to the land and it looks too hard and looks too difficult and they can't do it. Amen. They're looking at themselves, the unbelief that is in their heart starts to creep up. Amen. And it's not that they disbelieve who Moses is and they disbelieve the miracles of Moses and they disbelieve the supernatural. They disbelieve the message. &gt;&gt; But there was two who believed the message. Amen. They believed that what Moses had said about the word was true. that when Moses said, "God, come and told me, now is the time for deliverance. Now is the time to take your inheritance." That God had told our father Abraham, "I will bring your children back into this land." That time is now for the word. And there was only two people in all that camp that actually believed the message &gt;&gt; because the message wasn't go do signs in Egypt. That's not the message. The message wasn't part the Red Sea. That's not the message. The message is you're going back to your inheritance. You're coming back to be a holy nation. You're coming to be all that I already for ordained for you to be. That's the message. And in that message, they couldn't go backwards. In that message, they had to go forwards into the land. And in order to fulfill the message and in order to be the word made flesh, they had to go to the portion that was portioned out to them. They had to go take it. They had to possess it. They had to plant. They had to grow. They had to fight out the Canaanites. And they had to be established in their land. And that was becoming the word made flesh. That's what made the message believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was only one Moses, but they had to believe the message. Well, what does it mean to believe the message? It means to move on into the word and become the word and manifest the word and let the word flow through you. to come back to being the church that she was at Pentecost, to be established upon the doctrines of the fathers, to come back to everything that Paul said, everything that Peter said, everything that we were taught to be as a church &gt;&gt; with the full life, full manifestation, full gifts, everything. &gt;&gt; But not back to a one-man ministry, not back to everything being wrapped up in one man and that one man. No, that's not the message. The message is ye are the sons of God now. You are the sons of God and he's brought you back to your inheritance, back to your promised land. Now possess your land. &gt;&gt; Amen.
