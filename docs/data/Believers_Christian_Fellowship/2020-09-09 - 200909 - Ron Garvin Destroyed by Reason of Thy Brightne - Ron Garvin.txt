heart [Applause] [Music] me praise the lord god bless you it's good to see each one of you today let's turn to ezekiel chapter 28. i just like to open with the word of prayer before we read the scripture so if you just bow your heads with me heavenly father we know the prayers have been made lord and the songs have been sung and the praise and the worship lord and as we've prepared our hearts to hear the word lord and we come to this portion lord to hear from you lord and i pray that each one has come with an expectation lord and a a desire on their heart lord to to get something from you lord to give something but also to get something lord it's a needy day and age lord and if if we think we're without need i don't know where we're living it's just a wicked world with influences all around us lord so we just pray father that you would speak something to our hearts lord tonight that would be a blessing of eternal value lord and i'm very aware lord that i'm not capable of delivering that so i'm not intimidated by that lord because we just come yielded and just ask you to use myself lord and i pray that you'd anoint the hearers lord because i know how much i can fumble around and not be understood and and lord we just ask you to anoint the ears to take the words that are spoken lord and uh apply them to the lives of each individual lord you're able you're capable of doing that and i know that you will for each one that comes with an expectation when it comes to the desire on their heart i know that you'll meet that need lord because you're faithful and we thank you for it so we just commit the service to you lord i commit myself the congregation lord the words that will be spoken which is place it in your hands for your honor glory in jesus name amen praise the lord ezekiel chapter 28 very familiar scripture and i want you to hold your place in ezekiel if if you want to follow along because we'll be referring back to this quite often through the service and like i say very familiar scripture verse 12-17 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty like i say i know this is familiar to us but let's just look at it afresh again and just see what because we're god's addressing the spirit that anointed the king of tyrus lucifer and let's just take a look a fresh look at his uh characteristics you won't find anything negative amongst these to start with anyway full of wisdom perfect in beauty the aspen in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond the burl the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and the gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thus walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst to the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom he didn't say you didn't have wisdom he didn't say he didn't have beauty but because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast it to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee and it goes on to speak of his destruction like the title the thought this evening destroyed by reason of thy brightness taking that from verse 17. now this is reminiscent of what brother chad preached back in july i think it was he preached two sermons one was i was paying attention really brother chad i was uh the danger of having it too good and i think another one was uh strength without weakness is a weakness so this may be a little review on that but if you're like me you probably forgot it and we'll just refresh because paul admonished timothy that if you remind the brethren you'll be a faithful minister so we're going to be faithful to remind you and uh we just want to take a fresh look uh through this uh vessel we we know i'm uh you know me and it's not gonna be something deep it's gonna be something you're gonna put in your pocket and you're gonna be held accountable for it so we're we're not gonna let you off the hook we're not here for cupcakes and ice cream social we're here for the word of god so so look past the vessel let's see what he has to share with us today so we know that god wasn't addressing the king of tyrus but he's addressing that anointing that spirit that was anointing him which was lucifer and we're very familiar that we've been taught that all along uh lucifer was a perfect uh a being an angel a cherub i don't know the difference i'm not a teacher i can't break all that down that's not the purpose today but let's say that he was more than just an angel there was angels but he was more than just an angel he had a special position the covering cherub now i'd say that's pretty high up in the order of god and you know we're not going to dig out those things all the brother branham said on that we're not studying lucifer we're trying to apply something to ourselves today we're not trying to go back go home educated about lucifer today we want to go home educated or with a revelation of ourselves and we want to see in the mirror of the word ourselves where you can hold up a mirror and you can hold it at an angle if it's skewed they call it if it's skewed you can look at your brother you can look at everybody and not see yourself but that's not the purpose of the mirror that's to get a look at yourself so let's take the word and examine ourselves this evening so he was the covering cherub you know i don't know how special of an angelic being this was but he was above the ordinary let's just let it suffice and say that and god had made him this way but he fell because it became lifted up and pride was his downfall and like i said you don't know that i'm not a teacher i'm not going to approach it as a teacher a teacher could pull so many things on here out of here and we would just really enjoy that and be blessed by it but i'm going to try to extract a simple lesson that and just let god magnify that to you by revelation uh you know we're not here for an education we're here for revelation god brother braham didn't say pray for education pray for information he said pray for revelation so brother chad read a quote the other night uh from 1960 adoption series where he said teaching places a man positionally what he is and we want to be placed and part of that being placed as as uh you know knowing your position and staying in it uh you know it's not just good to know where you're placed you know that's my spot over there if you're not in it it's done you no good to learn that so if you want to benefit from it you've got to get in your position you've got to get in your place and brother braham told us not to try to take another man's place don't try to be a billy graham of course maybe the younger crowd doesn't know billy graham but in brother branham's day that was the you know pre-eminent minister so whoever the preeminent minister is in your mind or the preeminent christian oh if i could be like brother son so if i could be like sister son so that's that's no good you are you are who you are and that's who you need to be so i i guess just give me a chance to preach it myself and not try to be somebody else so we know that uh i'm no preacher no teacher so we don't want to get get over there and try to be that and just make a mess of things uh you know the uh the teacher places positionally where we are and who we are you know working in construction you've got the guys that run the heavy machinery equipment operators and they place the large heavy objects whatever it is a bridge beam or a air conditioner on top of a skyscraper with a helicopter and oh we admire those guys that do that but what if the helicopter operator set that uh air conditioner unit on top of that skyscraper and 100 stories up and there was nobody there to bolt it down his work's in vain there's nobody there to hook it up now nobody sees that guy one guy down there with a wrench tightening things up but we need him so uh we'll let brother chad do the do the teaching and i'll just crank down the bolts okay praise the lord so don't squeal when i get the cranking on you amen just say amen uh-oh i already hear an amens so uh so we've got to find our spot for me to be in my position i've got to stay there if it's just a bolt tightener that's what i want to be can't be of any uh help trying to run the other guy's job so i knew the same so we all admire those heavy lifters but if we're not a heavy lifter stay out of that position so let me uh make a little confession here and maybe this will help somebody else as well i was raised in the message but was never raised around a ministering gift i guess 40 some years you know in a in a message church but really didn't the pastors there did not have a ministering gift and we didn't have a lot of or a lot of didn't have a teaching gift we didn't have a lot of teaching gifts coming through so it's kind of a foreign thing to me and it's always been a little bit hard for me to receive from that and maybe even be a little skeptical because i knew that quote that brother chad read and i'm going to read it to you here again out of adoption 1960 it says bible teaching is usually a little treacherous and who wants to be in a tractor's position a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice now who wants to walk on thin ice not me but let's not quit reading the quote and i appreciate brother chad going on with it he says further on says at this time it might be good kind of to bring the church to what i think to a complete understanding position that who wants an incomplete understanding any volunteers for that so we want to come to a complete understanding positionally what we are in christ jesus and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother biller that teaching goes beyond that i probably knew that part also but you know satan let's put a little fear a little hesitation a little apprehension there because of that thin ice thing and who wants to be on thin ice and continuing on now preaching usually catches a sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until we have until we positionally know what we are so if we can never rightly know we need the teacher i don't care maybe i'm well this church has been raised with teaching ministry very prominent in it so maybe i'm speaking to somebody that's streaming or archiving the service we need each gift we need that teaching yeah it's a little thin ice maybe it's a little hard especially if you've not been around it uh been used to it accustomed to it maybe it's a little difficult to uh a little apprehensive about it but we need it so let's uh let's just get past our apprehension and uh and accept the gifts of god so maybe i'm speaking to somebody like i say that's uh that's been there or is there you know why if i could look back at myself and if i could go back in the years past and say you know i could ask myself why are you skeptical of it well it's thin ice but if god put a teacher there and it's god's gift do you think he probably equipped him with the ability to teach do you think he probably equipped him with the ability to skate on thin ice amen now a lumbering uh clawed like myself just better stay off thin ice that ain't no place place for me to be but the teacher is equipped with that you know why would you you know what a water strider is they'll go back to just speaking about nature water strider i think it's got six legs look like a big spider it just floats on top of the water and if you look at it it's his feet are there on the water but not sinking he's equipped now you and i say don't do that don't get in the water you better not get in the water but he can he can go right across it skip right across it god's equipped him for that uh if if you're a turtle you know don't try it you know you're going to sink so let's let the water strider be a water strider let's let the teacher be a teacher let's let him skate on thin ice god's equipped him for that and let's be blessed by it he may not have the gift of evangelize like brother chad was saying you know maybe not so good at uh making an altar call and and doing those things but well that's just just let god be god and use you as he as he uh desires to use us let's get in our place let's stay there every gift is one that god has placed in the in the body so let's let's make use of each one of them why would god place the five-fold ministry a teacher and then never use him to teach just sit on the light sidelines there and god doesn't do it that way it's a five-fold ministry and god gives him ability gives evangelist the ability to do that he gives each one of us ability to do whatever we do and i'm i don't want to come up here trying to do what i do i just want to come get out of the way and let him take the gift and bless you with it so it's a little intimidating to to stand up and speak and i'm sure i've uh related that to you before but i've got to walk in confidence that it's god's placing it's god's gift and he can do something with that if i'll let him if i'll let him use his gift as he wants to use it so you just suffer through be blessed by it because it's god's gift so praise the lord so people you know we look back i have no people that they don't believe in a five-fold ministry they believe in a one-fold ministry you know profit and profit only and then there's others that believe in fourfold ministry you know take all but the evangelists maybe maybe a threefold they don't want the teacher or the evangelist uh what what use do we have enough of a missionary an apostle you know we're here in america they're limiting god to twofold threefold fourfold uh you know that's almost like brother brandon talked about the trinitarians the oneness the twoness the threeness so what are you one two three four or five this you know what what what are you to limit god to he's got a five-fold ministry let's let's let him use that uh and uh sure we recognize the error when somebody gets up and tries to do something that they're not equipped to do but it's just a scarecrow and we've got to look past that and just and just trust the lord to uh to use his gifts to bless us so i'm i'm appreciating the teaching that we're receiving and been blessed by it but i think it's just individuals that want to re when they want to refuse a portion of the ministry which is a portion of god himself if they want to refuse that it's pride lifting themselves up which is kind of the subject today speaking about pride lucifer's pride that lifted him up when we become lifted up in pride and we don't want to subject ourselves to the evangelist because he's just too loud i don't like his presentation he's just in your face he's rude he's just uh we can come up with all kinds of excuses because we don't want to be hit and touched by that gift that god's going to use we don't want the teacher to get up and and and destroy our theology that we thought we had all figured out but then the gift of god comes through and places it because if if you and i are not places teachers we may think we've got it all figured out and the teacher comes and lays it all out and it's contrary to what we believe but well we don't want to receive the teacher because it's pride in ourselves lifting us up so we don't want to receive that so we're going to speak about that pride so they want to receive well they want to reject teachers of angels pastors whatever it is reject the pastor just we just we have the prophet we don't need all these other gifts and you know he fulfilled all those gifts or whatever their excuses so now they're free to wander around and just do as they feel free uh feel led to do of their own choosing that's not the way sheep act sheep have a shepherd you know people can get offended by that you can say to a crowd of people say well sheep need a shepherd so if you don't have a shepherd you must be a goat and some people go out all angry because they've been called a goat but it's because they've taken that description on themselves some people go out and bless thank the lord i'm a sheep and others walk out saying well he called me a goat so it becomes evident what we are that's pride again pride because if if the sheep is there and you call him a goat he'll examine himself brother brahma said the holy spirit always receives correction if you see someone or you are that someone doesn't receive correction and wants to rebel or resist check at nature because the holy spirit always received correction even when it's maybe not properly placed or not properly applied can you be humble enough to receive that can you receive the wrong accusation or do you rare up resist lord help us because it's a human condition through the fall that pride has come down from heaven it's come down to every one of us to one degree or another i've been amply blessed with that if you want to call it a blessing so i know what i'm speaking about so don't don't don't say i don't know what i'm talking about i do and i'm not proud of it so people don't want to be subject to the spirit of god whether it's whatever the fivefold gift is or maybe not a not even a fivefold minister maybe it's your wife you don't want to hear from that maybe it's your child or your husband you don't want to hear from that that resistance that what what is that raising up what is that resistance that raises up in you uh it's not the spirit of christ can we be humble enough just receive correction even from a child amen you know the apostle the apostle sets things in order we don't want things set in order we don't want to be taught we don't want to learn let's continue with that quote that i was just reading my brother chad had read teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are i don't i don't know if you read this part by the chad but the following paragraph now if the united states of this fair land here sent me over to russia as an ambassador of this nation to russia then if they have officially sent me to russia all the power that the united states has is behind me my word is just the same as the united states if i have been recognized as an ambassador and then if god has sent us to be his ambassadors all the power that's in heaven all that god is all of his angels all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly an ordained sent messenger to the people god has to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatever you bind on earth that will i bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth that will i loose in heaven and i give unto thee the keys of the kingdom oh such great promises he's given the church but how can we how can we avail those promises to us if we're not placed we've got to have the teacher place us in there correctly that's god's gift to us and how are we going to recognize our position how are we going to get there without that teaching gift so i guess that's for me and any others that are a little intimidated by skating on thin ice you just sit back and watch the teacher skate on the thin ice and enjoy it and benefit by it so i admit that i'm no teacher and uh so the focus of the service tonight is not to bring out details and and tie a lot of things together but just to uh bring a lesson uh that's taught by those facts and details maybe we won't go into all that but you know we could learn all about the seven church ages and we could know all the dates the names and all the details of everything about the church ages or the seals or or whatever great doctrine we we know of but if we don't understand the lesson that's being taught we really miss the purpose of all the facts and the details so we're not going to focus on the details let's let's get the lesson that's that's in this uh uh scripture reading for us tonight now hold your place there in ezekiel if you want to turn to first corinthians chapter eight verse one to uh one to two uh for me or we'll just read it here i didn't have time to put it up on a powerpoint we just give you a little exercise in your fingers first corinthians eight verse one and two now as touching things offered unto idols we know that all that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knows anything he knows nothing yet as he ought to know that knowledge puffeth up you know speaking on the teaching ministry uh puffeth up means to be lifted up exalted become proud that's an effect of knowledge now that's the scriptures it says knowledge puffeth up you say well then i'm going to have to be stupid all my life no there's a difference between information and revelation if you can take the information and it can become a revelation to you that doesn't exalt it doesn't puff up but if it's just information and just knowledge head head knowledge it's going to puff you up have you ever seen a message believer smart as a whip about the message about the doctrines and they were puffed up have you ever been there don't raise your hand you know it's so easy for us to to learn the things the revelation of this word and become puffed up by it i remember my brother burley williams uh speaking one time i think it was brother burley forgive me if it was the wrong man but he was giving his testimony one time i thought he was pretty sharp christian and seen a guy reading the bible knee kind of come up to him and must have that proud spirit and said you know what you're reading there he knows i seem to think well maybe i can educate you because you know i i know something well the scripture we just read says if you think you know something you don't know it like you should so when he comes up you know what you're reading there and the man looked at him says well how did elijah go up he said well he went up in a chariot of fire he said no he didn't he went up in a whirlwind just deflated him you know i think i was correct you have to go home check it out and see if i know what i'm talking about but anyway we think we know what we're talking about and we get puffed up and if you think you know something you don't know it like you should because if if this message if this revelation the message of the hour begins to lift you up you don't know what you're not believing the message you might believe the seven seals and the and everything you're taught here intellectually but you don't know it like you know it if it's lifting you up because it does not exalt you if you've got the spirit of god it's not exalted it's humble amen knowledge puffed up we don't want to just become data data information there's got to be a revelation that's why we're supposed to re we're supposed to pray for revelation not information if if this is lifting you up you don't know it like you ought to know it let's go back to ezekiel here let's look at this description of lucifer and you know we could say he had his act together he had his ducks in a row he had the knowledge which puffed him up he didn't have the charity which edify us because that's that was just i didn't uh focus on that verse one of first corinthians eight there says uh knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth satan had lucifer had the knowledge full of wisdom so he had the knowledge he was puffed up by it he did not have the charity that so he was no edification to anyone the same is going to be true for you if you've just got the knowledge you've got the information you're not gonna be a benefit to anybody you just become puffed up by it now where was i get lost here ezekiel chapter 28 the characteristics of lucifer full of wisdom perfect in beauty verse 12 that was verse 14 thou art the anointed cherub that covereth he had a position verse 15 perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created from the very beginning verse 17 speaks of his wisdom his brightness how did lucifer get like that he's perfect he had a special position he had these characters these qualities characteristics and qualities verse 14 says thou art anointed cherub that covet i have set thee so god put him there god anointed him think of judas iscariot there was walking with jesus and jesus made him the treasure being in the position like that is not the end all right we've got a position but that's not the end all if we get uh lifted up in that it will be the end all end of all god ordained it god placed him god created him god created him perfect god created him beautiful full of wisdom he did all these things that was god's choosing god's business god's decision what right did looser have to get lifted up it was all god's doing lucifer had no place but yet he he didn't have the character he didn't have that seed of god down in him that characteristic and it was just knowledge to him and it became lifted up and lucifer made a decision it says in verse 17 it says thou has corrupted thy wisdom it was his wisdom but he corrupted it it was his decision we've been blessed be called to this end time message this revelation of this day but we have a responsibility that goes with that we have to make choices we must make choices we can't just make one choice say yeah i'll serve you lord and then coast and free will the rest of the life's journey every day is a decision you've placed that before you just like adam and eve it's placed before you the choice every day we're free mortal agents we have to choose lucifer also had free will and he chose the path god did not force him down that path he chose the path that he went down we were also free will agents we've got to choose our path now this choice that lucifer made was not just a bad bad choice or a mistake uh an oversight of his it was a conscious decision on his part isaiah 14 12-14 says how out there fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weak in the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation and the size of the north i will ascend up on the above the heights of clouds i will like the most high it was his decision his choice not just an oversight we all make mistakes uh i'm going to put you in the same crowd that i am because i think you're all the same way we're just we just make mistakes we do we make wrong choices we make things uh decisions we have to apologize we got to go back and correct and and things that have got to be corrected and fixed every day this wasn't that kind of decision this was a conscious decision that i will it was his will placing his will above god's will now you know we're not here just to glorify satan or to just discuss his uh his downfall and go home but we want to we want to learn from this we want to see ourselves in this we want to see what can we learn from this who gave loose for these qualities god did who gave him his position god did so how's that apply to you and i well who gave you your position your position well i chose to come here to this church did you really uh i didn't choose this message my my parents chose this message when i was three or four it's well i had to come to a choice myself but i could have been anywhere you may have been raised in this message yourself there's been a whole bunch of people raised in this message and they didn't see it and they walked away so how come you're here not by your doing if you think that you're doing you're just you just haven't got the revelation yet you're going to be puffed up by that if you think that you made a decision and you can be proud and say man i chose the right path you're on the wrong path even though you're on the right path you're you're in the you're on the wrong track uh get the teacher just to straighten that out so you know what i mean though you ain't gonna arrive who's give you wisdom god gave lucifer wisdom who's given you wisdom you say well i don't have any wisdom the things we know in this message maybe we don't know how to relate it like a teacher would but if if you was to come across a seed of god that was a theologian and of the highest order and you would just tell him what little bit you think it is that you know it can spark that seed to life because it's something they've never heard before they've never seen before they've never realized before we're blessed uh so many people out there walking in in darkness and in blindness and you and i are not that way but it's not our fault it's god's choosing god's decision he didn't have to put a teaching ministry in our midst he didn't have to do these things we could be out there struggling along just believing god sent a prophet and uh and that be all we've got and never be positionally placed we're blessed beyond beyond our uh realization so many people around us don't have these blessings in their lives denominational people or even message people people attend attendees of a message church let's put it that way people that are better than ourselves better people more likeable than you and i kind loving sweet all the good characteristics but but just lacking that revelation this is god's choice not your choice you don't say i'm going to go and learn the teacher doesn't say well i'm going to go and study and learn all about the seven seals and i'm no if god doesn't show him if god doesn't if he doesn't yield to that gift in his life it's just going to come out as head knowledge which will puff up so we're blessed lucifer was the anointed cherub he had a position a position in heaven a great position you do too right of jesus christ would you say that's a good position i say it's pretty important but you didn't put yourself there god chose that before the before you was here to make the choice he chose it so really why why or how could we get puffed up uh well if it's just head knowledge you know the pastor the teacher the evangelist they all come here and they hammer it into us you're the spotless bride of jesus christ if it doesn't become a revelation it's only knowledge you will be proud of the fact that i am the bride of jesus christ and you'll go out flaunting it and just a lot of misrepresentation as the bride of jesus christ because the bride of jesus christ as we've been hearing is going to be the feminine manifestation of christ christ did not manifest pride if you're manifesting pride then that's a complete conflict with what you claim to be a good idea to re-examine and uh and check yourself out lucifer had a choice you've got a choice as well we are free moral agents we can be lifted up with wisdom because of our position in christ uh i'm sure you've known like i say ben maybe or or have seen people in the message lift it up and pried proud of it just oh they just maybe they want to debate and argue and just put their point and their doctrine to you and just uh you know to me i i can't compete why compete i i can't i can't outsmart nobody so but just you know let them argue and fuss that's that's not my my uh place now i've got written in my notes here that i'm approaching thin ice i don't even know i'm on thin ice so let me back up a little bit here the thin ice is say lucifer got lifted in pride and you can too unless you're bride of jesus christ you can't fall okay let's let's let the teachers clarify that that's a little thin ice we can go into all kinds of areas on that the bride of jesus christ cannot fall but she can be misled she can get anointed by other spirits uh and we're not gonna go into that but let's just clarify that a little bit matthew 16 verse 22 and 23 says then peter took him and began to rebuke him jesus saying be it far from thee lord that this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get there behind me satan now that was peter he was talking to just like the king of tires he was talking to the spirit that was anointing peter yet they behind me satan thou art an offense to me for thou savers not the things that be of god but those that be of men now he was know that peter wasn't converted at that time uh let's continue on luke 9 verse 51-56 and it came to pass when the time was come that they should be received up that that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said you you know not what manner of spirit you are of that is not the spirit of christ now of course this was before their conversion but we're going to continue reading for the son of man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to another village when we get to a position or an attitude where we want to destroy lives you know i i hate to make the confession publicly but we all get that way i suppose i guess i have i'll not throw you in the same boat but we want to reach out and rebuke without without charity charity edify it if you don't have charity how's it going to edify and i may have said it before one time there was a young young boy that had come to our church with his father that's from a broken home so he came to church time to time and i knew him growing up kind of had a burden for the for the young man just wayward out in the world and just really you know just he had no christian testimony and just you know he he probably didn't even claim to be a christian but but he had been raised around the message and he knew the right way to go and one day i was driving through a little town where he lived and i seen him and it just looked like he was on drugs he's just all bloodshot eyes and and just bleary looking and so i stopped there by him and i said isn't there a better you know i forget how i said it you know but isn't there a better way of living or something better that you could do with your life you know and he just looked at me and said i've been swimming well even if he was on drugs what kind of spirit is that that wants to lash out rebuke and and uh i don't know maybe it's maybe it's my own nature i have to stop here and have an altar call because it's so easy to get lifted up and think you know it's so plain you know why are you living like that we've got a beautiful message and why are you walking away from it and just uh is there as a is there a charity that can edify that person or is it just knowledge knowledge speaking out that doesn't edify anything just puffing you up lord help us galatians chapter 2 verse 11 and 12 but when peter now this is after his conversion but when peter was come to antioch this is paul speaking i was stood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself freeing them which were of the circumcision so even after his conversion peter still could be swayed all of us the same boat all of us brother brandon i i don't have the quote here but i think most of you are familiar with it and if those young ones maybe are not familiar with it brother branham early in his ministry he stepped into a diner to get a bite to eat and it was against the law to gamble and there stood a cop a policeman playing a slot machine a gambling machine had his arm around i think if i get the details right hank he had his arm around some young girl so here's the law of the land breaking the law his arm around some young girl and an old woman over there i think she was drunk sitting with a couple of old drunk guys and brother brandon just grieved his spirit and he just died god why don't you just how can you stand it lord just just wipe them off the face of the earth you know just just come down and judge this place and however he said it but but god rebuked him and said come over here took him behind the door of the of the diner there and i forget how it was that he he said i think he showed him a vision that's what it was he showed him the earth with the blood of jesus christ encapsulating it circling it and every time brother bran would make a mistake that sin would go up but the blood of jesus christ would catch it and and spare him from judgment he says now i've done that for you but you want to condemn them and made a difference in his life he went back with charity and it edified because he went and talked to that old lady he says can i talk to you you know what's led you down this road you know and and they had a prayer meeting right there got down on their knees and led her back to christ now that's a different situation than wiping them off the face of the earth too often we can get under that influence we've got to recognize what that influence is we we can want to rear up especially if somebody says something sharp to us or or rebukes us or something we don't like and just lord how can you stand this sin your oh lord come quickly that's a selfish prayer uh this isn't in my notes but it's on my heart that's a selfish prayer oh lord come quickly well that's what the scripture says you know you know if if i don't cut the time short then no flesh will be saved or i forget how it reads but but go back and read that we'll let the teacher clarify that what was they speaking of there were they talking about the rapture the catching with the bride let's take a look at abraham the father of our faith instead of saying yes lord that sodom and gomorrah is a filthy place you mean you ought to go down and wipe it off he said can you spare them if there's 50 write on down to 10 can you spare them and god would have spared however many thousands of people in that city wicked city for ten souls he couldn't find ten they drug four of them out of the city and one of them turned back so only three were saved but that's how much he cares um yeah i'm right here but god rebuked brother branham for that attitude uh i guess you could call it arrogance pride lord strike them down i've spared you but you you don't want to spare them charity surfaced charity edified god help us to have that same tenderness to be subject to the holy spirit that he can speak to us the holy spirit's tender meek gentle we should cherish it that spirit is so opposite to everything in our culture especially america you don't see any any charity out there i mean you can you can get little glimpses of it kind of like you know uh and maybe kind of whitewash it and make it look like charity and i know you know maybe i would offend somebody by saying that and they said no there's good people out there there's salvation army okay okay i know let's just say let's just say the majority if that suffices you it's not out there you've got to go looking for it if you're going to find it it's a foreign experience to our to our culture we should shine it brighter and brighter uh all the time people are hungry for it and they're not getting it anywhere else we all know the story of joan and the whale and uh you know from sunday school we've got that lesson but perhaps the greatest lesson is like the last two verses jonah chapter 4 verse 10 11 then said the lord thy hast had pity on the gourd because you know god raised up the gourd to shade jonah and give him a little respite from the from the heat and but then the gourd withered and we know the story there he says you have had pity on the gourd and you didn't even do anything uh to bring that upon you know to bring that about so you had video on the gourd for which that's not labored neither made us to grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more than six core six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle that's a story of grace right there because in jonah chapter 1 verse 2 he says arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me this was a wicked city no denying it god admitted it go out and cry i'm going to judge him why didn't he just go go judge him why didn't he just go wipe them off the map but yet there was six score thousand that didn't know the difference between left and right he had mercy and grace on them he offered them a chance even though they weren't elected they weren't uh they weren't his people but they were living souls um let's let's say they were six score thousand serpent seed but yet it was life and he had mercy up on it like saying i'll preach myself under conviction here and you have the preacher down down on the altar here and i don't know what we're gonna do with about after that his tenderness amazes me if we're of his spirit then his character characteristics are going to show out you don't know what spirit you're of what's what characteristics are you displaying is it his characteristics john and james they didn't know what spirit they were of they were showing the wrong spirit let's let's look at our text again let's see if we can read about ourselves in there ezekiel chapter 28 full of wisdom perfect in beauty now didn't jesus tell his disciples that i was given to them to know all the mysteries you know you'd say well i'm not i'm not a wise man i'm just i'm just a dumb farmer i'm just just a worker out here i don't have any gifts i don't have any knowledge i'm just not that smart but god told his jesus told his disciples it's been given to you know the mysteries it's been given to you you are blessed to know the mysteries what magnificent revelation we've been given around this this message and and we'd i'll speak for myself and just take it for granted uh i can't imagine being out there in a trinitarian uh environment or uh believing in a trinity i can't belie you know what they what do they believe about the sin in the garden and just walking in darkness don't let it puff you up though be thankful to the lord that he's shown us perfect in beauty he said well i'm not a beautiful person i've got all these problems i've got all these faults and all these failures and uh are you justified justified means as if you've never done it that's perfect right you know if you've never done it if you've never done anything if you've never committed any crimes you've never committed any sin you're perfect is that the way you read it that's the way i read it so are you justified well then you're perfect people say well i'm not beautiful brother ron well you're not marred by sin he said well you haven't seen my past no you're not looking at it right when we become positionally placed we're going to realize all those sins that we've been tagging around on our back that don't belong to you you say but i i committed that i did that uh we'll let the teacher bring in the position on that um how we doing on time here you're all doing good i got a two-hour drive i'm doing good too this is more than life to me i'll just share a little thought when i came to this part i didn't write it down trying to conserve time i just ain't got no more sense than to go ahead and share this you know as a farmer and a simple person i like alice chalmers tractors they're orange and you may be a john deere fan they're green just imagine a john deere farmer going out and buying an alice chalmers tractor but being so ashamed of that orange tractor on his farm that he he just goes out and paints it green so so one day the alice farmer looking for that special collection tractor for his collection he uh he sees that green alice chalmers and he says that's that's not a john deere that's an alice chalmers so he buys it brings the alice chalmers and now you have to stretch your imagination on this one it brings that tractor back down on the farm with all the orange tractors and that tractor is so ashamed of itself so i'm just a lowly john deere now don't get offended if you're a john deere fan we're not going to have a riot here says i'm just a lowly john deere i can't fit in with all these perfect uh orange tractors around here and and the owner could say but you're not a john deere you're a green alice chalmers no i've been an alice i've been a john deere all my life i've i lived with the john deere's i had the same fuels of john deere's and i was maintained by the john deere mechanic and i i've been a john d i was on i come off the john deere farm i'm a john deere no you're not that man can take that tractor in and strip it all down and paint it back orange with that tractor for lack of a better example never accepts the fact that from the factory it was at alex chalmers it was painted the wrong color and it lived on the wrong farm but it was created and now it's chalmers he said but i i pulled it alice chalmers plow and i did alice chalmers i pulled a john deere plow and i did john deere things and i you've been a you've been in alice just in disguise maybe that'll positionally place somebody i don't know you never heard a teacher like that have you but we get to look in the paint looking at the paint on the outside and say i i've walked through this world and made a mess of things and from the factory that's not what you were when we can become positionally placed and we can recognize that it's not going to exalt you if it exalts you you're the wrong spirit but if you're of the right spirit now i'm getting way ahead of myself i'm getting on thin ice again but that's okay god will save me if we can see who we are we can walk fearless you know that let's say that alice chalmers it shouldn't lift them up in friday you just give them joys like this is where i should have been all the time i i should have been walking in heavenly places i was over there on that farm but i really belonged here and this is you know and i had nothing to do with it the the people the factory put me together like this this is this is what i was ordained to be so what you ordained to be the bride of jesus christ the queen of heaven what better position that's better in my book than the covering cherub but we can't get lifted up because if we do it's the wrong spirit oh so perfect in beauty you know i i think orange is beautiful that house chalmers i don't care what color it is it's still an iced chalmers of course it's prettier when it's orange then when it's green and god's gonna clean you up and he's going to he's going to make you what he desires you to be perfect in beauty that collector that bought that green alice chalmers it was beautiful in his sight he knew what was hiding under there there's some orange paint under there and i'm going to expose it that's the way he sees us he knows what's hiding under all that corruption and muck of our lives he knows what's there he's going to clean it up and he keeps telling you he brings the teachers in and tell you the evangelist and everybody else and me tell you you're looking at you're looking at things wrong i'm looking at things wrong we see ourselves wrong we we get to look at the outside and we don't realize who we are we're beautiful in his sight and so how can that be take his word for it walk by faith sin you know satan's sin lucifer sinned sin is doubt don't you be doubting take take his word for it you're beautiful in his sight justified as if you've never done it that alzheimer's never was a john deere never it may have been green but it never was a john deere you never were a sinner now i'm on thin ice help me brother chad you never were a sinner you you walked out there and and things got looking pretty bad but in god's sight he knows what you are because you are part of him and god's not a sinner amen praise the lord don't try to undo what god's done if he says you're beautiful take manny's word believe it you know you know somebody so easy for us to say well okay lord if that's what you're saying but you really don't believe it you haven't got the revelation yet if you had the revelation if i had the revelation how would we walk how would we walk the spotless bride of jesus christ is that what you are is that your description now perfect in beauty spotless bride come on are we talking about the bride of jesus christ do you have a position lucifer had a position you've got a position spotless that's perfect lucifer was made that way from the day he was created our history goes back further than that amen before the foundation of the world a part of him okay when was god created that's when you were created go figure that one out that spins my head i'm going to get off that thin ice so lucifer was a covering cherub but you're the bride of jesus christ he had a position he fell from it you've got a position the bride of christ will not fall from that position so it's we we want to keep that straight he said well if i can't follow then i'm going to just paint the town red that shows you have not arrived yet you think you know but you don't know as you ought to know lucifer's heart was lifted up because of the things that of these things these characteristics the qualities his wisdom his beauty he was lifted up because of these things that's what caused the fall but the bride will not fall let's keep that straight but if we get lifted up what's going to be our outcome the bright she can she can get influenced by the wrong spirit and she can become proud if you see a proud message believer don't say well they're lost no how about a little charity there on your part to edify that person to bring them back to their proper position if we are the uh if we're the elect lady we're not gonna fall if we're not the elect lady we we will fall but the elect lady will also not be ruled by that spirit of pride now we've got that influence in our lives through the fall every single one of us it's a human condition to one degree or another we've got that and we've just got to keep squelching that and and subduing that crucifying our that flesh that wants to raise up with that pride so pride brought lucifer down you know the loose the angels were put on free moral agency uh 1960 that dale calvary brother branham says uh god put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the true life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminences to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble we've been given given the same position same circumstances as lucifer had qualities and a position brother braham says in uh breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals he says you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice we want his choice we're free moral agents but when you're redeemed you surrender your will now adam and eve wanted their own choice they wanted they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so they probed into it and it caused death now when a man's been redeemed he don't care anymore anymore for scholarship he don't care for any more of the things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice and that's all of it he's redeemed he just no more wants to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker seeing and then he goes in the name of his maker when the maker tells him to go there's the difference we're free moral agents but when we're redeemed we surrender our will we surrender our choice uh maybe a teacher can explain that to us jesus had to surrender his own will he had a will he had a choice but he surrendered that you'll do the same if you're the if you are if you are the feminine manifestation of christ you will also surrender your will if you're not you won't so when you see yourself being lifted up pride because of your beauty because of your knowledge because of your wisdom because of your position uh take a good close look if you're just okay with being proud then that's manifesting who you are but if it terrifies you and causes you fear then there's a way back and you've got to humble yourself let me see if i can wrap this up we've been called to a position but that's not our security sitting here in this church because your parents brought you it's not a security being married to the pastor being married to a preacher the song leader the deacon that doesn't that doesn't do anything being elected as a trustee or a deacon by the voice of the church that doesn't is not your security so having the position is not your security lucifer lost his because of pride the choices that he made but like i say we know the bride's not gonna lose her position but she can come under that influence and be lifted up arrogance and pride have no fellowship with the spirit of christ it didn't in heaven pride lifted him up that's why he was cast out he god is not going to take pride back into heaven at the end so if you've got even a hint of it in you it's got to get out it's got to be surrendered it's got to be crucified you know we all know people have walked in the knowledge of the message and but choices have led them to places that they would have never never thought possible to be and we all make mistakes we all make blunders we're all full of faults in that sense of the word because we're still struggling with this this human vessel that we've got here so we all make mistakes and that's that's not the problem the problem comes when you make a conscious decision i'm gonna go this way i'm gonna you know god's pulling me i i i feel it i feel i feel it but i'm gonna go this way and when you exert your will over god's will and he'll let you do it because he's a gentleman that's when the trouble comes if you're a child of god he'll let you go down that path till you get sick of your own choices don't go too far don't go at all but so many times we have to learn the hard way and god's been merciful to me to spare me a lot of trouble but i've done my own fair share of creating enough trouble for myself but when we make a conscious calculated decision to deviate from the truth we're on dangerous ground we're showing what spirit's leading us it's our own self-will i don't know how much more sober of a message we could ever receive because you're just right on the brink of death the bride will not exert her own self-will if you see you've got a tendency to exert your own self-will you need to come to the altar because that's not going in you know it's very disheartening to see someone claim to be a christian and living any kind of a life it's embarrassing at work they they call them cussing christians and you know they're just mocked there's no relevance put on that individual's lives it just they're just you know people may like them as an individual but they put no value to their opinion because they're just they're wishy-washy you know don't be cussing but then they're cussing over here don't be cussing don't be smoking well i'll i'll take a cigar but just when i'm out fishing and or just when a baby's born and i'll smoke a cigar but you ought to get rid of that they're not going to listen to that so so that's embarrassing to to see that kind of a christian example that's not christ that's not it's not uh christian values what about the message i mean even as an american you know let's take it on down to the super colonel here you hate to see americans you think america had had things good and and we had values and we had uh good characteristics and and we see americans go around doing this that and the other it's kind of embarrassment to you uh we gotta realize who were what kingdom we're of we because we can't be a proud of this nation and the conduct of americans you're not an american i'm not an american uh we gotta admit it we don't have the characteristics of it they don't have our characteristics uh we've got to realize our our nation's from above but then we get down to the a message believer that that's arrogant and proud and just rude and profane or you know just not displaying the characters of christ it's just a it's grieving to our spirits but how do we react to that do we uh do we have the charity that can help that brother or do we do we uh judge him and say well you know just uh infidel there a wolf in sheep's clothes but it's an embarrassment to us because we see that that's not the characteristic that was displayed by our lord jesus christ it wasn't the characteristics displayed by william branham that wave sheep that's that's come before so we see how an adopted son acts are you an adopted son if you're an adopted son you're not going to be acting in a contrary manner to that say well brother brandon made mistakes he did and he made him right had his wife lie he uh he made mistakes yeah and that's that's what that's what we do as humans we make mistakes but we go back and we fix it if you're willing to just let it ride and go on down the pike maybe your experience needs to become a little deeper and god help me god help the evangelist that we stand up here and speak we can speak with the spirit of charity we can speak with a spirit of pride and even though we're speaking the truth if it's coming across in a spirit of pride it just it's uh it's not going to benefit it's not going to edify i you know i love the things we're being taught because i think we're being taught the truth i appreciate that but if it comes across in a spirit of pride i don't want to be a part of that because we can't something's going to go wrong somewhere lucifer had the beauty he had the wisdom but he didn't have the right spirit and if you've got the wrong spirit up here speaking truth it's going to go off the serpent spoke some truth to eve but there had to be in a different a little dif there's a different spirit because it was saying but but surely you know surely surely there's god wouldn't do this something that's just kind of saying that you know surely you're above that you know surely that's not going to happen a little bit of i guess pride coming up there if we would want to say it that way so even though truth may be coming but if it's coming across in a proud way that's the serpent speaking uh husbands wives if you're speaking to your children speaking to one another speaking to your workmates whatever your schoolmates speaking the truth and if it's not through charity then it's the wrong spirit and it's not going to be beneficial let's examine ourselves you know down through history christians killed and murdered and tortured and name it in the name of christ we're beyond those days hopefully don't reoccur but we better you and i better be beyond those days uh but that's an oxymoron that's a that's a false disciple to say i'm a believer in jesus christ and then go out and live by the sword and go ever just contrary to what jesus christ uh everything he taught that proud they're you know false disciples because they're out killing in the name of christ so what about a proud belligerent rebellious arrogant message believer how's it any different wrong spirit if you fit in that category proud belligerent rebellious arrogant message believer you need to get saved you need a conversion you know it even leaves a bad taste in my mouth to even say those characteristics along with the name of christ or a message believer leaves a bad taste in the mouth let alone to witness it amongst someone and worse yet would be to witness it in myself i hope that it would grieve our spirits to see that i'm not saying i'm above it saying god help me i'll exhort you this evening if you find yourself identified that proud spirit we've spoken of repent there is a way back if you're too proud to repent there's little hope for you there is no hope for you until you repent if you've got that proud spirit now it manifests itself in different ways america is proud beyond any nation that i know of i've been privileged to just meet a few you know the pakistanis are most humble people just precious people but if you're with them long enough you realize they got proud pride too it just manifests in a different way some a little more palatable to an american all of us are that way you know we appreciate i really enjoy the overseas brothers because it's a breath of fresh air to get away from the pride and arrogance of america but it's a pleasure it's a breath of fresh air to be with god's people wherever they're at you know if if we can't come to church and get a breath of fresh air from walking out in in the society and and the workplace if we can't get a breath of fresh air here we're in the wrong church we're in the wrong place we need to find somewhere where there's a spirit of god living in people manifesting in people you be that breath of fresh air for me let me be that breath of fresh air for you repent humble yourself if you see these things in yourself turn from that path reject that spirit of pride would the musicians come please we know the bride won't be lost so we're not trying to put a spirit of fear when you say because we see that spirit of pride in us i suppose all of us see that demonstrated or are evident at some point in our life no doubt multiple times a day repent don't wait till the communion night why why wait why wait for the next communion you may not be there let's get it right now let's have communion every day amen we may not stand in the front and take the bread and the wine let's have communion let's have the true communion you know if if god could keep the smell of smoke off the three hebrew children in the fiery furnace even the smell of smoke then he can also keep that smell of pride off of you you can be delivered to that oh it's gonna be a battle uh and i i'm gonna battle it tomorrow and the next day the next day the next day but it's not mine it's this it's this green paint i've got on me who had ever thought the tractors would have come into the service amen you love the lord let's let's stand have a word of prayer we've got to be delivered to that every trace of it he's not taking any sniff of it into heaven with him you ever buy a new car a new used car and there's been a smoker in it you know they can put all kinds of perfume in it but if you if you know smoke cigarette smoke you know i've been around guys at work that used to ride in a dump truck with them all day and they smoke two three packs a day so there i'm breathing two or three packs myself i know smoke i work in a smoky environment brother brian with the welders and stuff i know smoke i can smell it i don't want that in my car god don't want any not a trace if you're going to buy a car and you don't want it to smell like smoke buy a car that's not been smoked in it's pretty simple right don't buy a smoker's car and then regret it all your life god's not bringing that pride back in not a hint of it i said well how about how do i get it i got it from my parents and my grandparents and we're the proudest people on if you don't think god's able to deliver you that then uh you must be serving a different god that i'm servant amen let's buy our heads heavenly father a simple thought and uh a simple delivery but we thank you lord for the simplicity of your gospel father help us lord to recognize the spirits that influence us father and we know that you're not pleased by that spirit of pride you want nothing to do with it lord and if we're of your spirit we'll abhor it ourselves lord but we have to deal with it on a daily basis lord help us to recognize the lord when it rears its ugly head lord and just simply repent and just simply humble ourselves lord we just pray father that we can have that charity that edifies lord help us not to have a knowledge of the message as we gain information lord i pray that it becomes more than knowledge may it positionally place us lower that we can have faith father places father and lord we do pray come for you to come quickly lord but father i guess i would volunteer lord let us stay to the last one then you spared nineveh the wicked people that weren't even your chosen you had a feeling for them lord help us to have that satan tenderness of your spirit we love you lord we just ask you to bless these simple words to the hearts may it be a benefit lord i pray that has been delivered in the spirit of charity so that it will edify and be a blessing to the people we ask you to go with us this evening lord keep us safe on our journeys until you come for us lord we pray that you just lead us and guide us each step of the way if we ask it in jesus name and for young glory amen you got his own [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] may glory and cry please take away [Music] i pray one more time oh precious lord [Music] please take away all that's left [Music] make me hallelujah that was charity that edifies i've been edified by the word been corrected but corrected in a good way and there's so many golden nuggets that was dropped so many things that i wrote down that blessed me so much [Music] one thing at the end that he was talking about is he'd be willing to remain a little longer i mean the world is wicked the world is wicked it's evil and it's grieving on every hand every where you turn everything you hear every conversation it's wicked it's evil it's grieving but yet is there something in us that has a heart for souls i remember what it was like when i heard the message i was steeped in darkness but i thought i was in light i was blind but i thought i could see then the message came and it opened my eyes and it did something on the inside of me that was permanent and forever things that i couldn't do for myself the word did for me and do i have enough love in my heart to wish somebody else if there's one more that can experience what god gave me i'm willing to stay how many say i'm willing to stay for one more song how can we can we take the spirit of abraham the father of faith and say lord would you spare it could you is there any way you could spare can we implore with god oh what a what a spirit you know i went monday brother jeremy sanders and i went monday to go see levi yoder and his family and just to hear levi talk about the message talk about his church and his burden for souls anybody that would believe the message in his amish church he said he's trying to get reinstated to the church and he says he goes if i have to keep the rules i'll keep the rules just so i can witness to him he said if i if i have to keep a beard and drive a buggy and he said even said and not use a power drill he said which would be really nice which would be really nice he doesn't believe he has to do those things he doesn't believe he has to keep his beard unto him he doesn't believe he has to use manual tools he doesn't believe that he can't have power but he's willing to do it so somebody else in the amish community can receive what he received that's the love of god that's the reality i just say god give me that heart where if there's somebody else that can hear give me a willingness to endure evil and wickedness and debauchery i'll take it one more day even the weakening of my flesh as i get older and then i'll take it one more day i'll take it 10 more years i'll take it 40 more years if somebody else can have what i have that's that's the attitude of jesus his bride will have the same spirit you know god made lucifer all that lucifer was and if lucifer would have just stayed in position and stayed humble and stayed submissive he could have remained that forever he didn't lose it because god wanted him to lose it he lost it because he couldn't stay where he was and he couldn't stay humble he had to have something more he had to be a little bit better he said god help me be satisfied with my portion help me whatever portion whatever my lot in life whatever my position in the body whatever it is you've given me do let me be satisfied with my portion and let me live in it with all of my hearts [Music] something that blessed me is brother ron just being brother ron i love that he can take the freedom and just be himself and i was thinking in my seat when he was talking about the alice chalmers tractor i think it's shamgar using ox goad and brother ron just using alice chambers tractor to do the same thing to beat back the philistine forces the demonic forces that bring doubt and confusion about ourself and questionings about our past and ourself amen shamgar took an ox code because that's what he had and he beat back the philistines who were trying to rob him of his god-given possession amen but in in this place amen the devil's been trying to rob us of our god-given possession true justification a revelation of where we really came from that we never sinned in the first place and our brother ron being a farmer amen took an alice chambers tractor and drove back the philistines what an example if god can use brother ron and his love for an orange tractor to preach a truth and drive back the enemy what can he do with us the way he made us and where he's positioned us let's just be happy being what we are and let god do that whatever he wants to do with us and remember humility cannot be faked humility cannot be it's you can't pretend you can't fake humility the only way for the bride of jesus christ to express true humility is because it's a characteristic that's in the seed already you can't make it up you can pretend that all all that it needs is for that seed to get enough light enough word the right environment enough things moved out of the way so it can express what's already in it so what do we have to do we have to die to ourselves and get everything out of the way to express the humility that's already there you can't take humility and put it in humility has to already be there because it's the life of jesus christ and it just needs to be displayed i say god let me stay in the word let me stay under the shining light of your spirit until you can bring humility out of the sea in my life amen i've been blessed and been encouraged to keep pressing the battle keep doing what we do may we have charity that edifies i don't ever want to have a puffed up attitude when i drive by a drunkard or a homeless person under a bridge or or whatever crime i see i don't want to have any more pride or arrogancy say how could they my goodness if it wasn't for the grace of god i could be the one under the bridge i could be the one who abused his child or the one who stole or the one i could be that same person amen i didn't have any better start to life i didn't i didn't make any better decisions amen it was the grace of god that interrupted me from my own plans of self-destruction [Music] man how can i i mean cast condemnation all i can say is god if there's any way if there's any way for that man to come out of the gutter let it be lord if there's any way if you want to use me use me use whoever but god if there's any way somebody can find mercy if there's any way somebody can find your grace lord just let it be oh jesus beard plucked out of his face beat over the head with the stick mocked hanging on a cross being being mocked and ridiculed and scourged and forsaken and rejected could still look down and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what ought the bride of christ to do when she walks to this evil world say the same thing amen i've been edified i hope you have too i hope we walk out here different than the way we walked in with a different focus and a different attitude and a prayer in our heart amen we're gonna dismiss you in the name of the lord may god bless you and go with you sing another song i just want to [Music] in please will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday be in his will in every way to be lost found in his likeness to hear him say well want done [Applause] be please in his presence found in his likeness i just want to please [Music] to hear him say well done something [Music] more of you i've had it all but what i need
