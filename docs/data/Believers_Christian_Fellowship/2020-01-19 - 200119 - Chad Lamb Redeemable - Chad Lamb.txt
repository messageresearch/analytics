natural type to spiritual as life continues to come in the natural let there be birth in the spiritual taking place all the time amen that's what we're here for god bless you what we're standing is we turn to the book of luke chapter 19. i want to look at uh a thought i thought god's been dealing with me on for quite a while but i'd like to take it from the angle redeemable just the one word title redeemable luke 19 and verse 10 for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost oh hallelujah have you been found that means you were lost if you've been found it's because you were lost if you were lost it means you were in somebody's possession before that you had been found before your loss so that you can be found again hallelujah that should do us a whole world of good friends just that one scripture right there amen you can't lost what you you can't lose what you didn't already have so we were already somewhere amen and fell from that place amen and we're in a lost condition and the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost not just so that he could find and say oh there it is i'm looking for all there it is you know if you lose something of great value to yourself you go to seek amen and find that which was lost amen and when you find it you don't say oh there it is and turn around and walk back home that wasn't the purpose he came to find it to redeem it back to its original place hallelujah let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over the word lord jesus we thank you god for this wonderful day for this opportunity to gather lord let it not be a traditional gathering lord let it not be a habit lord my god let us come with earnest sincerity and dedication lord to worship you in spirit and in truth in order to hear what you have to say for us not a routine in our life but a predestinated meeting with you lord we pray that you would take control of this service have preeminence lord take control of this earthly vessel that you might speak eternal words through these lips and god that you might strike us lord with your word and bring us into a greater life than lift us into a greater manifestation that we might see you more clearly and see our position in you more clearly we ask your blessing over everything that would be said in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be you can be seated sorry i've got a quote here out of the mighty gun unveiled before us that i'd like to read this is from 1964 and as always i have a lot of quotes to read and we might get to him we'll see we'll see how the lord leads and how the congregation pulls amen amen because we know this is the joint effort but you know i was thinking i've got a lot of quotes and some long quotes to read and i i see ministers preach and they're so smooth and they're so good and they hit a quote and they go on and they don't spend all this time reading and they don't have 25 quotes and i thought man they're good they're smooth i like to do it like that but i can't do it like that i can only be what i am so i just pray that you bear with me i read a lot of quotes but i can't be anything other than what i am so just bear with me and the mighty god unveiled before us 1964 he says so god in the beginning was life the eternal one and him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh jesus was the redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back to how many of you believe you're redeemed oh that's enough right now we should close the service and go home rejoicing because if we've been redeemed it means we would somewhere to be redeemed back to there's been a position before there's been a placing before we've fallen from some position in some place that he came to seek and to save that which was lost to take it back to that place in that position hallelujah so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in god's thoughts see look at the priest when they see him express himself exactly with the word that he was they said it's beelzebub that shows where their nature was it was in the modern thought of the day oh praise god that shows where their thought was when he came to express the word amen they were in the modern thought of the day and so when he was expressing the word amen it was a true expression of a true word amen but because their thinking was carnal on the thoughts of today amen they rejected him and called him beelzebub because they they weren't from the thoughts of god and couldn't tap back to way before the thoughts of the modern day it was in the modern thought of the day but when the little prostitute that he met at the gate and told her expressed his messianic sign by telling her what she had done why she said sir i perceive that you are a prophet you know the messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the messiah the anointed one because he met the scriptural qualifications don't you see the two pieces of paper were coming together she we know that when the messiah cometh now he's saying the two pieces were coming together i mean i'm going to spend some time on this today because if i take the laundry men's ticket you know brother bam told us about the chinese laundromat we know this really really well but he couldn't speak their language amen so what he did is when they came and took their laundry to the chinese laundry room and he took the ticket and he tore it in such a way then now you have two matching halves and to redeem your clothes to redeem back what's yours to put it back in its right spot these two pieces have to come together and when there's a perfect match redemption can take place amen so you see now that the chinese men's ticket if you take this ticket and you look at our lives amen there was there was a portion and there was a separation that took place and one part were carry but there's another part out there amen and when these two parts come together redemption can take place because remember these aren't two tickets these aren't two separate tickets this is one ticket tore into a mailpiece and a female piece and when the male and female come back together they're one they had one origin they were one in the beginning amen they only match each other they don't match anything else that's the elements to redemption that's the needed peace to redemption amen let's read on and you'll see what i'm talking about by the grace of god we're in the same quote now god might have had to interbreed this and that to get this certain king of the bell like the motor he's talking about your natural life he made your grandma and grandpa and the different personalities and different ones moved around and got in place to get you the certain way he was because he was going to allow a portion of his self his attribute his life to come into a fleshly condition and he molded around that something that he can use to express what was going to be in the inside to get that certain thing hallelujah like like the motor but when jesus turns said i am he that speaks with you there was no such expression as beelzebub she left her water pot ran into the city and said come see a man who told me the things that i've done isn't this the very messiah now what did what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven she never looked at him and said please forgive me of my sins but brother brennan says when she recognized the word made flesh for her day amen what was happening the two pieces were coming together when the two pieces come together that's the necessary amount elements for redemption and her sins were forgiven her how could the prophet say something like that he said it heard quickly her sins were forgiven because i know the next part that's why i'm excited her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in god's thinking at the beginning because she was in god's thinking at the beginning part of god an expression of god she was redeemable and when she come in contact amen with the other half of the chinese ticket amen all the sudden she was redeemed amen and her sins were forgiven her she could have went to the synagogue over and over and over amen in that synagogue was that that old form amen looking back to what moses had done was not able her to deliver her out of her sinful condition but now something was coming amen because she had something inside of her amen that didn't match the way the priest explained the scriptures but she had something in her that was waiting for the scriptures to be made manifest in a word that matched the way she was made there was nothing wrong with the scriptures but they had been filtered through the mind of man and she couldn't find a match in the synagogue not because moses was wrong not because the scriptures were wrong but because the way the men were explaining it but when when the messiah came and he showed her the sign of the messiah and he began to answer her question about worship who worships where worship is the kind of true worship all of a sudden there was something that word that that moses had spoke was standing in front of her the word made flesh in her day and she had a matching piece down in the soul and when those two came together her sins were forgiven she had power to overcome something that the synagogue couldn't do something the priest couldn't do but when the two pieces came together it accomplished the goal quickly your sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in god's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifest of jehovah what he was what he is what did it do it redeemed her praise be to god i just want to tell you this was before calvary what's what's wrong with the prophet does he not know this was before calvary he knows it's before calvary because calvary paid the price of redemption but the price of redemption and the act of redemption are not the same thing there on calvary he paid the price of redemption amen i can you know i you remember the story brother yatzik told about the little boat now your mind your double mind amen the little boat amen he lost and and the little boy made the boat he lost the little boat amen he loved it he found it in the pawn shop and he wanted to get it and the man was holding claims to it so he had to pay the price of redemption he paid the price of redemption is not the act of redemption remember you could lose an item and you can find it online in an online auction or on an online pawn shop and you can send your money through paypal you've paid the price of redemption but the act of redemption is when you take that item back to yourself so this woman had come to the act of redemption before the price of redemption was paid but that's no problem with god because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the mind of god so god already knew the price was paid amen the price wasn't paid at calvary the price was paid in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but it was manifest or played out in time on calvary that's why god could redeem abraham and he could redeem isaac and jacob he could redeem all of them by what by faith in his word [Applause] but there had to be a price paid for redemption but that price was paid before the foundation of the world but in this dimension it had to be acted out it had to be portrayed it had to be manifest see it redeemed her or brought her back further on now when jesus come if he had come with noah's message it wouldn't have worked to build an ark and float out it wouldn't have worked but that noah was a portion of god he acted a peculiar way because he was peculiar and his message was peculiar because it was the word being made manifest he could not have come with moses message because it wouldn't have worked that was the problem at the synagogue doesn't fit good word but not manifest in the right age truth but not manifest in the right way she could never find the matching piece at the synagogue oh praise be to god now you know why nothing made sense till you found the message nothing made sense that you found christ the word made manifest today he was the word expressed for that hour but jesus could not come in that the bible never said he would come in that way but when he come expressed exactly like the testament had said he would be expressed then all those who was redeemable believed all those who were redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of god the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to god and amen so to be redeemable you had to be his thought from the beginning and was brought back to god as many as receive him to them gave he power to become sons of god because they were redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression now in the message it is the rising of the sun he says and god knows hallelujah he's got a predestined for ordained church he knows he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over at that wave sheath oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how many tried to tell him an ego he didn't know what an ego was yet he was an eagle he could not understand it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when he's seen not a denomination not a phd not an lld not a good neighbor but a son of god molded in the image of god with that dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle who screamed eagle what herd eagle the same thing calling is the same thing responding if there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond deep to deep eagle to eagle amen an eagle to an eagle the word from the foundation get this the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it so he says the word to the word he says the word predestinated the part that was in that little woman amen to the word written for that hour being expressed in that hour and when those two pieces came together that was it she was redeemed her sins were forgiven she was brought back to god oh hallelujah friends amen it's not another portion that doesn't fit but it's got to be the portion made flesh the portion revealed the portion made manifest in this day amen not a previous age this age not a previous day this day and when the word is made manifest this day the scripture is written for this hour that we're living in brother bram says what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour amen the manifestation of this hour not previous dispensations but what is the manifestation of this hour the word bride when that portion of the written scripture is made manifest it is the other part of the line through men's ticket amen and all we have to do is express the bride amen made manifest fleshing out this word living the word living what the prophet taught not reading what the prophet taught living what the prophet taught not not just pointing somebody to what he taught but manifesting it living it being the word made flesh in a mini-membered body that's the other part of the laundryman's ticket and there's pieces that are laying out there that's got to come in contact with the word made manifest for this day for this hour they have to see what the word is not what the word was but the what the word is brother brahman said in the message what shall i do with this jesus called christ 1963 and all these things that he prophesied to be in this day something has to bring that to life but when it's brought to life it'll be so much different than the people thinks it is it'll only be the elect we'll see it always just the elect is the only thing that'll see it because it is elected and ordained to see it therefore it cannot no other way but i said who is this melchizedek god vindicates that that's always been right god vindicates it to be true shown plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption people might make like think they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place hallelujah so it's only the predestinated will be brought back because the others didn't come from their sea bring back bring eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight we were his eternal thought from before but his eternal thought wanted to find expression in time in this dimension and he wanted to find expression with me standing in the pulpit tonight and you sitting in the sea or today we might still be here tonight i don't know praise god then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose i like that language the one that left home only come to earth to serve his purpose i mean have we recognized this world is not my home i come from home and i'm going back to home and i come home to home i come from home to earth amen to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again no wonder paul could say when this was a building a block to chop his head off death wears your sting oh grave where is your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory he said death tell me where you can make me holler grave tell me how you're going to hold me for i'm a possessor of eternal life he's recognized that death hell grave nothing could hold him and nothing can hurt us got eternal life he realized he was blessed with eternal life just like a little dewdrop it understands i don't know how to how to too much about i don't know too much about chemistry it must be that the congealing of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere i talked about this a couple weeks ago and another and another message from birth pains but here he's bringing it up and who is this melchizedek he's trying to get us to understand we came from home we're down here serving his purpose and we're going back home and so he starts to tell the story of a dew drop [Applause] why is he telling the dewdrop he's trying to get us to understand we've come from home we're going back home and he said sometime in the cold dark night amen there was a congealing of atmospheres what was it something invisible became visible something in the heavens amen which was atmosphere something in the heavens became visible and come to earth oh hallelujah what's he trying to tell us he's trying to tell us where he came from and where we're going the congealing of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere but the next morning before the sun comes up it's laying there the little fellow shivering he just let the sun come up watch it go to shining it's happy why the sun is going to call it right back where it came from that's why brother branham would come and preach shalom and they may be come and preach and he said shalom good morning the sun is up arise and shine amen it's the dawning of a new day he come and preach it is the rising of the sun amen the sun was setting on the church ages the sun was setting on denominationalism but it was rising on the bride and he said arise and shine for thy light has come shalom peace good morning amen it is the rising of the sun what is it that that light amen that word and full manifestation has now risen out of the church ages amen and risen to what to bring that invisible that's congealed together in a cold dark night and now bound to the earth that light is up to what change us back into where we were before to bring us back it's happy why the son is going to call it right back to where it came from what did this word come in this day for amen why was it the opening of the seals the manifestation of the word what was it for to bring us right back to where we came from and not just us but all the sleeping saints amen that had fallen asleep waiting for this promise waiting for this hour this is the hour this is the light this is the word that's going to bring it to pass that's going to take all the atmospheres back to the place that it came from praise be to god and that's the way with the christian hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of god something in us tells us that we come from somewhere oh praise god is there something in you this morning that's telling you i've come from somewhere not because the preacher said it not even because brother branham said it he said it to crowds he said at the thousands he said at the hundreds of thousands maybe millions of people by now on tapes and in books amen but it didn't strike them because they weren't there before it's not him saying it that makes it true it's not me saying it that makes it true but it's that you were actually there amen it is not you saying that makes it true either you had to actually be there and there's got to be something inside of you now that was actually there that's been quickened to life by this word that can say i was there show me your certificate i ain't got one show me your credentials i ain't got one the best evidence i have is the substance what is your substance what is your evidence faith is the substance of things looked for evidence of things hoped for there's evidence of things not seen i have substance i have evidence but my substance and my evidence will never satisfy your questioning we have to have our own faith and that's not of yourself it is a gift of god because of grace because of foreknowledge because you were there praise me to god hallelujah he said that's the way with a christian hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of god something in us tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by the power that is a pulling us amen it's not me pushing it's not me trying there's another power that has been released in this day and that power of this word amen when it come the full word it came with the power of the full holy ghost and that power is actually pulling me somewhere it's pulling me out of carnal thinking it's pulling me out of carnal living is it pulling you friends are you changing state amen are you shimmering and shining like the dewdrop is something in your life changing day by day week by week you see a holiness that you couldn't have before you see a temperance that you didn't have before you see something in your life is changing amen entertainments that we're holding are now letting go [Applause] it's not the power of pushing amen it's the power that is pulling the dew drop has no power to change itself back it's the power of the sun that is pulling it back and god has sent the word in this day amen without measure not in portion but in the fullness the full light of the s-o-n is here to change us back into what he always intended for us to be and it's a power that should be pulling us we shouldn't live like we did last week last year two years ago we should be getting pulled pulled pulled pulled hallelujah and as that little dew drop gets pulled but rem said in in birth pains it begins to shimmer and it begins to shake because it feels the power of changing it oh is there an enthusiasm rising is there an excitement on the inside knowing that this power of this word is literally changing me it's bringing me back to where i came from let me read that again something in us tells us that we come from somewhere we're going back again by the power that's pulling us the little dewdrop he glistens and shines and shouts because he knows he come from up there and the sun is going to draw him right back up again and a man that's an attribute of god born of god knows hallelujah when he comes in contact with the son of god he is going to be drawn up from here someday for if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men amen praise god let's turn to romans chapter 8 together romans chapter 8 and verse 29. let's start at 28. romans 8 and 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did pray destiny when did he fore no and how did he foreknow because you were with him he foreknew you because you were with him for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed and into the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified according to the word of god i'm already glorified but also according to the word of god i've been already saved when i was born i was saved my name was recorded in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world i was in the mind of god and the thoughts of god i was already saved already redeemed already that but then he come to this dimension to act out his thoughts to display to manifest the thoughts of god in the element of time and everything's taking place in time amen so i say that day i got saved no that's the day i realized i was saved then i became a son of god no that's not true that's when i realized i'm a son of god and began to act like a son of god you realize the works were done were finished from before the foundation of the world be to god so what are you doing now now we're just acting out in time the manifestation of the thoughts of god the word of god amen now has come down to manifestation in the element of time which god created and doesn't exist in but he's dropped down brother said this little hickey out of eternity called time and he's manifesting something he's doing something he's accomplishing a work we're doing this according to his purpose amen but we're here by his placing according to his purpose to accomplish something for his kingdom but guess what you've already done it amen amen when did you do it in the mind of god in the thoughts of god all the works were finished before so they were already accomplished in the mind of god his thoughts are eternal they are real amen and now what we're doing is in time now we're fleshing out in this dimension what has already taken place in the mind of god when jesus was nailed amen to the cross at calvary he was just fleshing out in this dimension what had already taken place in his mind we are as secure as secure can be when there comes a revelation amen faith that gives you a substance that gives you evidence there's no more being tossed about no more being afraid all the time no more afraid i'm not going to make it will i make the rapture am i good enough will god accept me this way he already accepted you if you'll ever be accepted you were already accepted before the foundation of the world when your name was put in the lamb's book of life that cannot be erased what is the message trying to do in this day it's trying to bring a security to the bride that makes her unshakeable unstoppable an invincible army because she's already made it the works are already finished she's just acting out for god's purpose what god once done in you this day and if god wants me arrested then i want to be arrested paul and silas amen and chains they could sing amen they could rejoice why because nothing is out of the plan of god everything's ticking right on time when you're talking about a predestinated seed of god nothing's out of kilter nothing's a mistake they could be in jail and bonds being bitten beaten being strapped being chained they could begin to sing and begin to rejoice because if i'm in a prison and i'm in chains i'm here because god thought it before the foundation of the world hey a real revelation of the truth amen is going to absolutely change our behavior we're going to stop walking around afraid of our own shadow amen scared of what's going to happen next worried about everything in life that's normal in a human condition things will happen your initial reaction will be fear anxiety amen that's just the human element that'll always be there but there's something in the watchtower now amen there's a life on the inside that has been there before that knows amen was in the thoughts of god before and that control tower will raise up and say hold it all as well everything's fine don't be afraid it is i there's nothing to be afraid of friends there's nothing to be nervous about there's nothing to be scared about everything is fine see people so timid so afraid all the time so worried that can be a natural condition some of us get more of that through the family genetics than others but there's a revelation that'll conquer that thing there's a real revelation that comes from god that'll start to push that thing down say i'm not going to be controlled by fear anxiety from the family tree from depression what do i have to be depressed about what do i have to be anxious about what do i have to be nervous about amen there's a substance in me there's an evidence in me that says i was there if i was there the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the lord that's either true or not true that's not one of those halfway statements it's either ordered or it's not ordered and i and i believe by faith they're ordered amen brother ben says again and who is this melchizedek now we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you were with him then oh i hope that sinks in you were with him then then is when the book of life comes into view now we read over here in revelation 13 the chapter 8 verse that the beast that comes up of the earth in the last days will deceive all whose people who on earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world think of it before jesus was ever born four thousand years before he came on earth and several thousand years before you came on earth jesus in god's mind died for the sins of the world and the book of life was made and your name was put on the book of life before the foundational world that's the bible truth see your name was ordained of god and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just part of his life you're just part of his life so my brother said you can no more be lost than god can be lost you you don't get eternal life you've always had eternal life because you're part of his life sir we see jesus in 1964 in the beginning god was not even god he was the great eternal and then there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expresses a word a word expresses a thought and then remember if you ever was in god's thinking you'll always be there if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age get that god thought when he thought he thought of all the ages you realize that you're not in this age by accident you've not showed up in the last day in the end time in the closing hours of of this earth in this time as we know it you've not arrived here by chance or by accident but you were his thought you were his thought of this age that means you've been precisely placed in the right spot for the right expression that means no matter you say this is satan's eating it's so hard amen it's so hard to grow up in satan's eden no it's not it's so hard why it's only hard if you're stuck in spiritual amnesia and don't realize who you are then it's hard yes there's temptations all around it's come to saints in the peak amen he's exerting the greatest power amen he's had over the earth and the greatest influence is everywhere but don't forget you're a thought of god an attribute of god an expression of god that he thought of being expressed in this hour that means you you have in you the potential amen everything that's needed to overcome satan's eating is already in you because god placed you here in this expression in this age before the foundation of the world you will not be overcome by satan's eating but you will overcome satan's eden what about our children and what about that oh man just get them to the lord amen let the holy ghost quicken that seed inside and let them get a revelation of who they are where they come from where they're going what their purpose is and they'll overcome satan's eating they will absolutely overcome because god has ordained that they will overcome we're not afraid of the age we've been predestinated to this age and we've been predestinated to overcome in this age so there's no fear in this age i'm looking forward to overcoming this age i inside of me amen not my mental capability not the earthly human spirit not this flesh but inside of me amen is an attribute a life of god a portion of god himself that he ordained to be expressed in this age i'm looking forward to living in this day it's going to get worse praise god i've got something already ordained to overcome the worst of the worst of the worst [Applause] the prophet talks about a persecution coming on the brine they'll try to stop her from preaching they'll close these churches she'll be a hunted persecuted little group praise god something in me is already pre-programmed to meet that challenge of that day if i'm alive in this body when those things begin to unfold it's because god already saw me overcoming those conditions i'm not afraid of that amen if i fear those things then i pray god give me a greater revelation so that i realize i'm not here by accident i'm not placed here the prophet didn't say those things to scare us there's no fear it's the final destruction of our enemy it's the final blow it's putting the enemy finally under the feet of the bride and it's eden god built in eden satan slipped in to destroy god's eden so satan now has taken six thousand years to build need and god has slipped in god slipped in how did he slip in god slipped into satan's eating his age how did he slipped in he slept he slipped in in the form of his bride [Applause] and just as when satan slipped in in the serpent and began a deception the bride has slipped in and now she's going to uncover the deception [Applause] and just as god's eden was destroyed satan's eden is going to be destroyed by what by god's secret commando army do you realize you're not just a mom raising babies you're not just a kid in school you're not just a man making a living for your family you're an elite fighting force you know you would have never been happy in luther's day you'd have never been happy in wesley day you say oh if i could have lived back if i could live back where you just took a prairie schooner and you got a couple horses together and got your family and just clip-clop down the trail to go you'd have never survived there because you were pre-programmed for this day you're designed by god to overcome these conditions overcome this day does it destroy the works of the devil and he will god will put them under your feet shortly you're god's elite fighting force that he saved for the last that he saved for the worst condition oh you've got what it takes you already got what it takes it's already designed it's already happened that's why amen that's why a prophet could see it because god's already seen it he could show it to a prophet so that means it's already happened now we're just now we're just going through the motions as it's going manifest in this time element now it's being completed here but it's already been completed there that's how god could show the prophet things that will happen in the future amen if if god shows him things that'll happen in the future that means it's already happened so when it happens it's just happening again remember brother branham when he would get amen when he would get a vision of a healing and he would go into a room and he says no this person's got to be sitting there and this hat has to be sitting there and the kid why he's already seen it it's already happened so when it happens it's happening again when you overcome you're overcoming again [Music] when you face a trial you're facing a trial again it's already been in the thoughts of god now it's made manifest in flesh we're not afraid of what comes next not afraid of the doctor's report not afraid of a new government official not afraid of new laws that are coming down the pipe people get so worried about politics they're changing the rules and you know you just get something they change and all of a sudden it hits you know uh whatsapp or text message or emails and it goes everywhere let's all pray they're trying to change this and they're trying to change that law let them change the laws what are they going to do circumvent god's plan do you think they're going to change what god's ordained forget about politics politics has nothing to do with us the world's falling apart brother man said let it fall apart don't try to prop it up the faster it falls apart the better it is for you and i i'm not here to prop up the government and prop up the i'm just here to live the life god's ordained me to live according to what he's already seen let it go let politics go let policy go let government officials go it's not going to get any better oh they're going to change the laws and restrict churches and you're going to have hate speech laws and perfect if that's what god wants that's what i want if that's what god ordains that's what i want why because god has chosen us to express him in this age and in this day you're his thought let me read this again you are the attribute of his thought for this age so there's no more longing for another age oh i wish i was here when brother branham was here no sir i would have missed my whole purpose oh i wish i would have been here to be in the prayer lines i don't like to see in a prayer life i'd like to be an eyewitness but god wants me here i want me here i want my thoughts to start matching god's thoughts amen not carnal ideas or carnal thoughts not longing for another day not longing for a previous age not long for another time but i want to be right here doing what he's ordained for me to do in this hour and i want to do it with boldness and i want to do it with confidence and i want to do it with joy we're not afraid we're still in search we would see jesus there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world you and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it's not what we think what somebody else thinks it's what god eternal you always was see in his thinking who is this melchizedek again now in the beginning god dwelt alone with his attributes as i spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw what he thinks he's going to build create he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form because god is the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts and that's his desires now it's a thought then he speaks it it's a word then a thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed as a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought than a word i want to read something out of the church age book that i think will help us right now in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book he says the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal are you one of those thoughts if you can see this you can see many things here's a brother so he's honing us in he's trying to get us to dial in the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you can see many things god is unchangeable on both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so that therefore he as god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge and he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real this is the part if we can hone in on just just lock in on this for a minute and pray for revelation because this isn't going to come by carnal understanding the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of god you realize the thoughts of god are not like ours we cannot draw a parallel between these two you say that was in the thoughts of god that doesn't mean that god was just having a thought like you and i will sit and think and then we'll draw it out on paper and someday it'll become real no god's thoughts are already eternal they are already real they are already a real real thing they are a real substance they already exist so we can't equate god's thoughts to our thoughts we can't draw an equal life it is totally different god's thoughts are eternal attributes of himself god's thoughts are already his family they are real and they are eternal not will be real they're real when something comes manifest into this dimension doesn't make it real brother ben said this dimension is a vapor the scripture said this is a mist brother ben said this is the negative that's the positive this is a negative reflection of a positive somewhere else so this isn't the real this is a reflection of the real that's the real so when brother man said god's thoughts are real they're eternal they're not like our thoughts it's not like i think this and someday i'll do it and then it'll be real no he's already thought it it's already done it's already real now the positive is reflecting in the negative and this is a reflection of what's already in the positive so we have to stop thinking of god's thoughts as a fairy tale or a myth or a vapor this is the vapor that's the reality we got it absolutely backwards that'll help us as we move forward let's turn to job chapter 38. you know i could say it like this david when he became king he was already ordained to that position he's already told he'd be that position he's already god's choice when david moved into that position and began to lead his armies in the battle david wasn't hoping he'd win when david met goliath on the battlefield he wasn't hoping it would work why because he was already in the thoughts of god and god had already ordained him to be king he was going to lead the armies he was going to be the king of israel so when he went on the battlefield david began to run towards goliath he wasn't you know he didn't get five stones and he didn't say you know oh man i hope i i hope i didn't make a mistake i hope everything's going to work out all right at the end of the day i hope i see my dad again it wasn't that attitude because he had faith in what he was doing because he believed what he had been told he knew his position he knew what he was called to he had a purpose he had a calling and so now he was that was driving away all fear and all anxiety his purpose and his position was moving him into action then we become the king i mean he wasn't he wasn't leading his men in the battle hoping they win he knew that they would win because that was his position that was his calling and friends we're not walking through this life hoping we'll overcome we're not hoping everything will be all right we're not hoping we'll win hoping we'll overcome it's already prophesied we win we overcome the enemy is defeated there's no no weapon formed against you that shall prosper nothing is going to defeat god's purpose in our lives there's no reason to be afraid there's no reason to worry there's no reason to hope it'll work out it's working out right now it's working out perfect all the plans are perfect everything's set in order and you say oh russia's got a new nuclear weapon that we can't stop that's what the prophet already told us you're not wringing your hands and you're not oh russia's got bombs that we can't stop praise the lord that's prophecy being fulfilled but there's also another prophecy not one will fall until the bride's gone we're not afraid the news report doesn't make us anxious it doesn't make us nervous [Applause] [Music] the president caught a strike on a general now everybody's getting upset [Applause] if everything falls apart and everything around me goes to chaos it's part of the plan of god it's something god wants to accomplish it's something god wants to manifest it's something he's already seen this message came to break spiritual amnesia this message came to break us out of carnal thinking out of a laodicean condition came to break us out amen of amnesia to get us to realize who we actually are and where we came from and where we're going and what we're doing here on this earth there's nothing to be afraid of friends job 38 verse 4 where was thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declareth thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof with thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sing together and all the sons of god shouted for joy let's look at what the prophet says about this passage of scripture in 1958 in the serpent seed it says dear god the great mighty god who formed all things by power of his spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back to his marvelous fellowship that we had again with god as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world look what the prophet saying we already had fellowship with him but we don't remember it we come with spiritual amnesia we had to come with spiritual amnesia to be proved to be tested amen so that the attribute of god could be proved and manifested amen but we were there we were in the thoughts of god now remember the thoughts of god are not like our thoughts they're real you were really there you weren't kind of there amen sometimes people try to poo poo this idea by saying well that was just in the thoughts of god oh yeah just in the thoughts of god the thoughts of god are more real than this world the thoughts of god are more tangible in this world it's more of a reality than this reality right here this isn't reality the thoughts of god are reality it wasn't well that was just in the thoughts of god well praise god i was there with fellowship with him and the thoughts of god that's more solid than this is right here now that's more of a confirmation that's more powerful than this right here praise be to god i'm so thankful that was just in the thoughts of god because that can't break that can't bend that can't melt away that can't be changed that can't deteriorate with time that can't change its form that's the thoughts of god they're eternal and they are real that means if i was there i was real amen this isn't real that's real and that's really me [Applause] praise be to god you're more solid than you ever thought you're more secure than you ever dreamed of your position is not moving unflinching unwavering you were already there real eternal nothing's going to change that you were there not as a flesh man you were there as an attribute of god a son or daughter of god to be expressed to be made manifest down here but you're already there [Music] you're so solidly placed that nothing will move you it says we are taught i'm going to read this again we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain well the lamb wasn't really slain he was slain in the mind of god if he was slain in the mind of god he was really slain then the negative had to show the positive we put too much stock on the negative and we don't realize the negative is reflecting the positive if he was slain before the foundation of the world he was really slain [Applause] and then in time amen then in time what had happened had to be reflected in time and a time element in the ages and in time was a negative reflection of the positive that it was taken off of we've got it completely backwards in our carnal thinking and denominational instruction has reversed the whole thing well that was just in his thoughts please don't say that anymore don't say it that way please don't like well that was just in his thoughts if it was in his thoughts i would rather say well that was just manifest in time [Applause] that well that just happened here in time if it was in those thoughts it's real it's the real real this is not the real real that's the real real praise be to god that's why brother ben said you've never seen me you've never really seen me you've never really seen me well i take that back if you're an expressed attribute of god you did see me and i seen you and we had fellowship together with him before but we've come in spiritual amnesia into another form into this body to reflect and express that so you've seen me before amen but you not with your mental understanding and your human eyes has ever really seen me [Applause] but that attribute of god down inside you saw me and i saw you and we sang together you think what we're singing here is so special what do you think it was like then all we're doing is reflecting back to then you're rejoicing now over the plan of god it was because you rejoiced before over the plan of god this is just a negative reflecting the positive amen that was real worship that was real revelation we saw the plan of god and we rejoiced and we sang all of the singing at the end of service all the rejoicing during the preaching of the word is a reflection hey what's already taken place hallelujah how do we know that that wasn't at the same time the lamb was slain i'm so glad god sent a prophet friends to absolutely tear down carnal human thinking and try to lift us out of this condition of a hybrid mind and back into the real realities of god how do we know that wasn't the same time that the lamb was slain that when god and his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus further in the serpent seed he says i want to ask you who is this job 38 when he said where was you when i laid the foundation of earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that shouted for joy jesus told them that jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world jesus talking to his disciples but them said i enjoyed you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give them eternal life and raise them up at the last days no one can pluck them from my father's hand he gives them to me how are you going to lose what a good question how are you going to the next person that comes to you ringing their hand oh i've got a prayer request say sister that's already a testimony brother that's already in the mind of god that prayer request is already a testimony stop wringing your hands and start looking around for the solution because there's a solution there's an overcoming amen don't be downtrodden don't be downcast get excited because if something bad's happening something good is on its way [Applause] praise be to god he said no man can come to me he said we're not creatures of time or creatures of eternity no man look at the scripture he goes to no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give them eternal life and raise them up at the last days no one can pluck them from my father's hand he give them to me how are you going to lose see you're scared you're afraid you'll run around here and that's one of the best evidences in the world that you haven't been nowhere yet what a rebuke remember fear anxiety that's all part of the human condition that's the human spirit and human mind don't get all upset if the first reaction you have is fear and anxiety but you take that fear and anxiety you bring it subject to the word of god and you say i'm not going to let fear i'm not going to let anxiety i'm not going to let worry amen trump the word of god and the revelation in my heart there is nothing going to defeat me there is no weapon to form that to destroy me satan's eden will never have victory over me none of his diseases none of his complexes will ever take a hold of me because god already saw me a finished work before the foundation of the world let's turn to ephesians chapter one ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ are you already blessed are you waiting to get blessed are you waiting to be glorified are you already glorified those who he predestinated four knew he predestined those who predestinate he called those equally justified those who be justified he hath glorified now you can say exactly like jesus christ said father glorify me with the glory i had with you before the foundation of the world well that was just in his thoughts amen that means i've already been glorified now we're just going through the action to display in this dimension what's already been done the negative is now reflecting the positive he hath already glorified me i can say like jesus christ said father glorify me with the glory i had where in your thinking amen his thoughts are real they're eternal that i have with you before the foundation of the world amen you see how secure you are you see amen we are on the same path [Music] hallelujah all right let me get back to my text blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love i hope someday i can be holy and without blame no he already chose you and him before so that you could be holy and without blame there is now therefore no condemnation brother bam said you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the first place because you were there and that's real oh the devil's losing friends he's losing amen if we can stop thinking like humans and start thinking like sons and daughters of god the devil will lose if we can if this word will take us back to the mind we had the mind of christ the devil will lose where in the world am i praise god that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will let's go to john 15 now the gospel of john 15. i hope all these scriptures start to take on more depth more color a deeper reality we've read through them we've read through them we've read through them but we can read through them with a carnal understanding but all of a sudden when the eyes begin to get focused amen all of a sudden when we read through them it's like i got it john 15 26 john 15 and 26 but when the comforters come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and he also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning i wonder which beginning he's talking about it brother branham said in the message the serpent see he said he told his disciples i had joy with you before the foundation of the world you're my witnesses because you've been with me from the beginning brother says 1955 beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation see we come out of eternity we was before there was a world did you know that god made man in his own image where was you he said to job when job thought he had some wisdom where was you when i laid the foundation of the world before i laid it when the sons of god sang together in the morning started shout out for joy the morning stars shouted for joy them shining ones shouted for joy when they seemed that someday they would tabernacle here on earth did you rejoice that's why you're rejoicing because you've already rejoiced if you weren't rejoicing there then you won't be rejoicing here [Music] them shining one shouted for joy when they seen that someday they would tabernacle here on earth and the king melchizedek would come in the righteousness of god and give his life to redeem us back to god back again and outshine the stars forever and ever 1964 spiritual amnesia he says now be a true christian you have to be to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice and he is in me and i in him notice in every christian that's a real a real genuine christian who wants to identify with that every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shot up for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy if you're a genuine christian you was there and if you was there you're only here to reflect what was already over there let's go to john 17. let's read these scriptures with eyes that can see john 17 6 i have manifest thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were thine they were and thou gave us to me and they have kept thy word when matthew was a tax collector when peter was a fisherman when andrew james and john were washing their nets what's he talking about he's not talking about when they were washing the nets he was theirs before they washed the nets he was there before they were born he was there before they were in the womb of their mother and they were his before said thine they were thine they were and thou gaveth to me and they have kept thy word john 6 john chapter 6 and verse 63. it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of the father why because it happened before it's not just happening it's already happened brother branham well let's let's look in revelation chapter 4. you know that john is caught up through the open door after chapter three he's caught up through the open door brother ben said he's in the vision and he's caught through the open door let's let's read from verse one after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne and he that was to look upon like a jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like into a nim room and around about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like under crystal and in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and and the first beast which i saw i'm going to stop right there i want to go back to verse 4 now so he sees he's caught up in the vision he's caught through the open door he sees heaven open and he sees a scene that is set but when he looks at the scene in verse 4 he says around about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and 20 elders you see that so he sees 24 seats and on the seats are 24 elders are there 23 24. who are the 24 elders the 12 patriarchs and the 12 apostles let me ask you a question who's john [Applause] who's john and where's john john is one of the twelve apostles if john is one of the twelve apostles where is he sitting in one of the 24 seats he doesn't see 23 seats he sees 24 seats so when john's standing there looking at the 24 seats and the 24 elders one of those elders is john himself why because it's eternal in the thoughts of god it's already happened he's already there john was living on life on earth john was an old man on the isle of patents but john was already there overcoming sitting in one of the 24 seats as one of the 24 elders what do you think that did to john praise be to god let's go down to chapter 5. and i saw on the right hand of him you know what if i was john oh praise be to god if i was john and i saw that you're not going to get me to come back and grumble and complain amen if i already caught the vision if i was already seated there on one of those seats amen don't tell me it was in the mind of god amen if i was john i'd be rejoicing every day of my life because it was a finished work it was already done he was already sitting there god wasn't going to come along amen and john come back to earth and john make a mistake and god go back and rearrange the vision god was not going to come back and say i need a do-over john i didn't realize you would make that mistake so now i've got to pull you off of one of these 24 seats and put somebody else that i got to redo it [Applause] there's no redo in the mind of god there's no do-overs there's no i mean got to do it again there's no mistakes it was perfect already set in the mind of god and john saw it in the vision what you need to see is you need to see yourself seated in heavenly places in christ jesus an heir a joint heir to the throne and if you can see yourself there oh what a rejoicing time amen that'll be revelation chapter 5 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now when you go to chapter one this is the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him which he sent and signified by an angel unto his servant john so everywhere along this book of revelation you have an angel talking to john angel talking to john angel talking to john but not when it comes to the opening of the seals when it comes to the opening of the seals and the revelation of redemption it says in one of the elders [Music] one of the 24 elders [Music] let's see issacra no god no judah peter matthew which elder was most interested in john getting this revelation which of the 24 elders was most interested in john this is just me i can't show you a quote but i got a feeling i know which elder was most interested in john amen i think it was john i think it was one of the 24 hours was interested in john rejoicing don't weep john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed [Applause] look what brother branham says in the breach what a jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leaves the intercessory box to come here to possess his claim you know that got next to john he must have saw his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy because the scripture says everything in heaven and on the earth and under the earth heard me rejoicing he must have got real happy listen what he said and every creature which is in heaven on earth and underneath the earth such as her in the sea and them as in heard me saying blessing honor glory power be to him that sits upon the throne unto the lamb forever amen and amen and amen the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that lives forever and ever talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries are is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is i was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption come from the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestations and old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor and might and power be him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when the seals broke john must have looked in and seen past the current of time and said there's john he must have looked in beyond the current of time and said there's john yes sir that's exactly what he saw he knew he was there he knew he was included he knew his name on that lamb's book of life he came to begin to rejoice because when he was sad and downtrodden and didn't know that the lamb had prevailed and was going to open the book and loose the seals amen there was an elder that came to him not the angel the elder came to him one of the 24 you pick which one you think it was he said don't weep john the lion of the tribe of judah there was an elder who was interested in john what a happy time when them seals broke john must have looked in and seen past the current of time and said there's john oh he was so happy he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in earth everything beneath the earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong to him why because he saw redemption why did brother branham say the sons of god were singing for joy because so they saw the plan of redemption now when you come to revelation chapter 5 john is a type of who the bride and john is the type of the bride has an elder amen that he already seen sitting on the throne amen he has an elder come to him and tell him weep not amen and then he begins rejoicing amen when he sees that the lamb can take the book that's why brother brenham says and who is this melchizedek paragraph 88 then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting eternal in the heavens when you recognize this message with eagle's food and you left the others what was he talking about just before this the story of the little eagle being brought down as an egg and hashed out in the chicken yard and then the denominational chicken yard and not knowing what it was but an eagle came over crying to an eagle below and the chinese ticket was coming together and when the chinese ticket come together you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting praise be to god let's look at that in second corinthians chapter five we'll just wrap up here with this thought praise be to god i don't know about you but i know what they were rejoicing about now in chapter five i know why john got so excited it's the reason i'm so excited amen because i recognized this eagle scream there was an eagle screamed to an eagle and then there was word that connected with words in my life i already saw this happen [Applause] i was down here i didn't understand i didn't know why nothing ever fit i tried i went to church i loved the lord i prayed but there was no overcoming power there was no real life of christ everything was a misfit but i when i heard the eagle scream one day and i recognize how did i recognize not by my mental capability but there was something down inside was the same thing that this was the word predestinated to the word written for that hour and when i got to that point all of a sudden there was a connection because i heard not from the angel john didn't hear from the angel that the lamb had taken the book he heard from one of the elders that the angel took in the book and when you recognize this eagle scream and you left the others you were formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theology and you can say that's just in the mind of god you want but praise god i'll dance just the same i'll shout just as loud because it's real it wasn't my mind it wasn't my emotions it wasn't my mother it wasn't my father it wasn't a family tradition it was me the real me on the inside contacting the real matching part amen it can happen at an altar it can happen in your car it can happen at home it can happen during service it can happen in a prayer line it doesn't matter but there's got to be a connection from word to word eagle to eagle life to life holy spirit the holy spirit that life of god has got to come together again you can describe it any way you want with any emotions you want attached to it but that's what's got to happen and when that happened you heard from your theophany i didn't say it the prophet said second corinthians 5. i'm not even in second corinthians right now i don't even know where second corinthians is praise god i'm losing my carnal mind i can't read no more amen all i want is to know this this is everything to me i don't need to know any more math i don't need to know any more science i don't even know this is all that i need to know because this is the light that is taking this moisture back to the atmosphere where it came from it's moving me changing me the molecules are moving and one day it's going to go back to where it was [Applause] second corinthians i'm in first corinthians praise god second corinthians 5 and 1. for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle we're dissolved we have one we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so there be that being clothed we shall not be found naked your soul won't just go and be naked it's got to be housed and if it leaves this earthly tabernacle there's another one eternal in the heavens it's already there let's go to matthew 18. praise be to god i want to ask you a question did you hear the eagle scream did you recognize it was eagle's food did you leave the others were you formed into the living image of the living god then you have a theophany [Applause] then you have something eternal in the heavens a representation in heaven eternal in the heavens god's not going to change it out just like if john would have went back after the vision amen after he wrote the book of revelations and fell he was not going to pull john off of that seat and put somebody else in he's not going to take your eternal representation in heaven and crumple it up and toss it away and do another one if you heard the eagle scream and you left the others and recognized it as eagle food and you've been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany you're secure you're steady you're unmovable you're unshakeable you can no more be lost and god can be lost you're as eternal as god is eternal not this part but the real you the attribute of god on the inside amen has come from god is going to god it has a house already built to house it if you lose this house there's another one waiting because you've got representation already in heaven that woman at the well when she come to jesus amen he says why could she believe it and the pharisees couldn't because she had representation in heaven and they didn't it wasn't ability it wasn't mine it wasn't good works it wasn't a good raising it had nothing to do with nothing on the earth [Music] it had to do with what taken place in the mind of god before the foundation of the world amen she already had representation in heaven she already had a body eternal in the heavens [Applause] and when she come in contact with the living word the word predestinated met the word written for that hour and when it came together all her sins were forgiven and she and what did it do it redeemed her she was brought back what did it do to you the same exact thing people are trying to point people back to things that have happened ages ago to have their sins forgiven sure sins were forgiven when these two pieces came together what did it do when these two pieces came together it redeemed her what did it do for you the same let's go where did i say matthew 18. i just started turning then i get excited quit turning praise be to god matthew 18 and 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven let's read again take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven nineteen sixty one questions and then answers now he said take heed that you don't despise if you'd really take interpretation the word is mistreat to mistreat one of those mistreat a child you should never do that their children they don't know and notice because their angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven see other words their angels their messengers their bodies angelic bodies that they go to if they die are always before my father's face in heaven brother man calls these in another place theophanies angel bodies that they go to if this one's dissolved and he says only the redeemed have angels not everybody only the redeemed have these angels and he calls them theophanies he says now i'll read it again they're angels they're messengers they're messengers their angels are their messengers that means you can get a message from one of these angels i don't know maybe if you heard the eagle screamed and recognized and left the others recognized as eagle food maybe you heard from your messenger their messengers their bodies angelic bodies that they go to if they die are always before my father's face in heaven see now if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting is that right that's a body brother brahm says in the message jehovah jireh 1964 then there's only 12 was left he said unless you drink my eat my flesh and drink my blood all these other things they started leaving only 12 was left and he turned around and looked at them and said i've chosen 12 of you and one of you is a devil he said do you want to go too then peter said these great words to whom shall we go lord for we are sure that thou has the word of life they had seen it so clearly vindicated no matter what the priest said what anybody else said they knew right there that that he had the word of life you have the word of life and now we notice no matter what the others done how they walked away those disciples were predestinated they were ordained to eternal life no they couldn't explain it they couldn't explain it no more than the rest of them could but there was something in them that representation in heaven a thought that god had of them before the foundation of the world had manifested itself here and they were connected with god and was sure that was god's promise vindicated and nothing is going to change it from them that's real genuine christianity that's the real genuine article a connection to god that goes back to the mind of god their representation in heaven the woman at the well had representation in heaven the priest had no representation in heaven if you heard the message if you heard the eagle scream and recognize it was eagle food and left the others you hurt from your that must mean you have some representation somewhere it's eternal in the heavens man said in the message it is the rising of the sun and one day when i was weary myself if you boy you'd better go ahead you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for that the lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old see and there that morning that quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain of time and i seen all of you over there what did he say he's looking at living people they were very much alive they weren't dead yet he said i i looked beyond the curtain of time the quickening power come on me i look beyond the curtain of time and i've seen all of you over there question is did he see you over there i've got a substance in my heart i've got an evidence inside of me that says i was there he saw me there i mean i don't know the mechanics of it i don't know how it works i can't explain to you this that or the other mechanical i don't know the mechanics of it i don't understand the mechanics i don't know how it works but there's a substance in me says i was there too the reason i shout nor i shout and rejoice and sing in revelations chapter 5 is because when i saw revelation chapter 5 before the foundation of the world i was one of those morning stars i was one of those sons of god that shouted for joy and saying that's why now when i see the book taken in the hands of the of the the king and i see him tear the seals open amen i rejoice just the same because i've already rejoiced over my redemption and now i'm rejoicing again when i begin to sing the songs of glory remember brother yatzik said there was a mystery in the song of solomon there was six songs where's the seventh song the mystery song the complete song it's over in revelation chapter five when they begin to sing thou hast redeemed us from every nation and peoples and tongues amen thou has redeemed us who's singing that song i'm telling you right now if you're singing that song of the redeemed it's because you sang it before in the mind of god before the foundation of the world because only the elect are catching what's happening in this day only the elector catching the fullness of redemption that is coming this day only the elect are recognizing chapter five has already happened and they're singing the song because the lamb's taking the book and loose the seals thereof because they sang it before are you singing in now are you singing a new song amen it says in revelation 5 they sang a new song not the same song they sang to the denominational ages but now we've come to the end of that and they sing a new song of the lamb taking the book and i'm singing and shouting and oh i just wish that i had the same freedom i had back then because who knows what it looked like then but i'm telling you something inside of me is changing it's going to start looking a whole lot like it looked before because we're coming right back into that same image that's why you wave your hand that's why you shout that's why you say amen that's why you sing that's why you praise the lord that's why you wave your hand because you were there before and it's just awakening something inside that has already seen this act today praise be to god friends this isn't our first time around but maybe that was just in the thoughts of god it's the thoughts of god that are ensuring you get it right now it is what took place before the foundation world is making sure it's acting out right now it's not him that will us him that around us by the will of god and by the spirit of god see he made sure it's going to happen and he made sure you're going to be there because you were already there i sang i shouted oh but chad explain the mechanics i can't explain the mechanics i don't care about the mechanics i got the dynamics the mechanics will take care of itself i don't have to worry about that but i know it's true and i know it's real and i know it's genuine something come to me a messenger come to me i said it's all right the lamb's taking the book oh what's singing what's shouting what rejoicing because of redemption praise god let's all stand may god be with you friends musicians if you could come to the gym can you say from the bottom of your heart that inside of you this has happened if you don't know this if you don't know what this is like i wouldn't spend any time doing anything else i wouldn't waste my time on any other endeavor on any other project on anything else so many times we try to live a christian life cut this out and cut down out and cut and we preach cut this out because that's the gospel it has to be preached because the children of god have to wake up to the age of living and move away from deception it's got to be preached brother brennan preached he preached on clothes and hair and makeup and all of those things and tv and entertainment and worldliness he preached and all that we'll preach on all of that but you can be trying but if you really want to overcome let this down here and this up here come together and when it does all your sins will be forgiven and it'll redeem you and the revelation of who you are will change your conduct [Applause] we'll always preach holiness we'll always preach the right and will always say what's the wrong but if you're not sure that this has happened don't invest any more time in trying to be good don't invest any more time and trying to find another church that'll do it for you another church will do it for you if you're not sure that this has happened i would lay before the lord and say god i need something from you to where i've got an evidence in my heart amen i've got i mean i've got a substance amen i've got an evidence by faith that tells me i have connected to the unseen i have connected to something that that i was before the foundation of the world something real something genuine has come together in my life and i know it and i'm rejoicing over it sometimes you see people they act a little bit perturbed that they have to believe the message because of all the requirements for living a clean life and a moral life and cleaning the face and not cutting the hair getting rid of whirling and it's a little bit irritating sometimes because we want to keep a hold of a few things why couldn't that just be you know just a little bit easier the problem is you just don't know who you are yet because when you catch a revelation of who you are that thing on tv don't matter i mean it has no pain that makeup has no attraction a hairdresser those friends all of a sudden when you catch a revelation when there's a real awakening of the real you on the inside those things just lose their attraction they're just not attractive anymore there's not another church that'll fix that there's not a different style of preaching that'll fix that the only thing that'll fix that is when those two pieces come together and there's a real genuine new birth experience that brings a revelation of who you are where you came from what you're doing and where you're going then everything else is pure joy serving him is pure pleasure amen let's sing that song joy unspeakable and full of glory i have found his grace is all complete let's start with that i have found his grace i am is me oh oh is amen i believe how many believe that half has never yet been told why because there's something in me that's saying there's more there's more how do you know there's more because i was there when more was given out oh and something in me wants it all i want more and more and more of this great revelation more of the unveiling of god do you realize when brother bennett preached the unveiling of god or the mighty god unveiled or masterpiece or all of these you know what else he's unveiling you he's not just unveiling a mystical being somewhere far away he's unveiling god in all of his attributes which includes you when he becomes unveiled you become unbalanced when the book was loosed you were loosed because what is the believer the words in the book when the seals were open you were open when the seals were loose you were loosed no longer bound we're free people just catch that revelation you're free whatever's binding you now you're free from it doesn't matter what it is you're free because god didn't see you bound before the foundation of the world he saw you free he saw you redeem he saw you rejoicing amen so that's what you really are [Applause] everything that's happening now is just expressing god and moving us back to that praise be to god they're stepping stones friend they're expressions of god amen they're testimonies of the word amen so be it let him be expressed in me let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father god how happy we are to know your redemption plan how happy we are to see that the lamb has taken the book and loose the seals we're rejoicing with the same kind of rejoicing we had with you before the foundation of the world god give us clearer eyes clearer vision a greater revelation bring us by degrees back completely lord to that understanding we had before god we love you we thank you for your goodness for your mercy god i pray that you would just take us lord as we leave here and go let us go rejoicing in every trial let us rejoice let us go with thanksgiving because you've never seen us defeated you've seen us victorious help us to see ourselves in that same condition lord you are the victor you are the overcomer you are the almighty god you're overcoming according to the apostle paul said blessed be the god of all peace that'll bruise certain under satan under your feet shortly it's you doing the bruising but you're doing it under our feet god let us realize your plan in this day and let us move with your plan with faith with a greater faith than we've ever expressed before give us that substance give us that evidence and the lord if there's something somebody in here that doesn't have the substance they don't have the real evidence of faith lord i pray to give them a revelation lord that you would take them back to that place they were in your mind before the foundation of the world that you would awaken lord that seed on the inside and lord that you would bring it to life by the baptism of the holy ghost and lord that they would recognize their day in the age they're living in and their position in you oh i pray god of your great give us greater vision lord greater faith we love you god we ask your blessings as we leave let us go lord in your name serving your purpose lord we go with genuine rejoicing in our heart in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing the original life the original life
