[42:47] Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
[42:49] in the presence of God to join together
[42:52] this man and woman in holy matrimony.
[42:54] me. It is an honorable estate instituted
[42:57] of God, signifying unto us the mystical
[43:00] union that is between Christ and his
[43:02] church. It is commanded in the
[43:04] scriptures to be honorable among all,
[43:06] and therefore is not by any to be
[43:08] entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but
[43:10] reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
[43:14] soberly, and in the fear of
[43:16] God. Into this holy estate, these two
[43:19] persons come now to be joined. We have
[43:22] gathered as family and friends of this
[43:24] man and this woman to lend our support
[43:26] and goodwill to this holy
[43:29] union. Who will give this woman to be
[43:31] married to this man?
[43:59] You can be seated.
[44:14] Alex Christopher Bartram, will you take
[44:17] Amy Elizabeth Preston to be your wedded
[44:19] wife, to live together after God's
[44:21] ordinance and holy in the holiest state
[44:23] of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort
[44:25] her, honor and keep her in sickness and
[44:28] in health, forsaking all others, keeping
[44:30] yourself only unto her so long as you
[44:33] both shall live? I
[44:35] will. Amy Elizabeth Preston, will you
[44:38] take Alex Christopher Bartram to be your
[44:40] wedded husband to live together after
[44:42] God's ordinance in the holiest state of
[44:44] matrimony? Will you love him, comfort
[44:47] him, honor and obey him in sickness and
[44:50] in health, forsaking all others, keeping
[44:53] yourself only unto him so long as you
[44:55] both shall live. I will. Let's all bow
[44:58] our heads together and pray.
[45:02] Dear Lord Jesus, as we've come together,
[45:04] Lord, we've gathered on this special
[45:06] occasion to see Brother Alex and sister
[45:09] Amy joined together in the holy union of
[45:12] marriage that you first instituted so
[45:14] long ago in the Garden of Eden. And
[45:16] Lord, we pray your blessings would be
[45:18] upon this ceremony, Lord, that your Holy
[45:20] Spirit would be felt, that you would be
[45:22] present to bind this woman and this man
[45:24] together. And may you bless all that we
[45:26] say and do. May it bring glory unto your
[45:29] name. In Jesus name we pray.
[45:35] Amen. And I'd like to speak for just a
[45:37] moment on the covenant of marriage. And
[45:42] I'd like to begin by just talking about
[45:44] covenant in general just for just a
[45:46] moment. Uh in the beginning, the the
[45:49] Bible starts in Genesis with the story
[45:51] of God creating the heavens and the
[45:53] earth. And we see him forming everything
[45:55] that he formed. And he created the
[45:57] Garden of Eden. And he placed a man
[45:58] there. and he put a man under a
[46:00] covenant. And it says in Genesis 2:15,
[46:03] "And the Lord God took the man and put
[46:05] him into the Garden of Eden to dress it
[46:07] and to keep it." And the Lord God
[46:10] commanded the man, saying, "Of every
[46:11] tree of the garden, thou mayest freely
[46:13] eat. But of the tree of the knowledge of
[46:15] good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it,
[46:17] for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou
[46:20] shalt surely die." So God placed man to
[46:23] rule over this garden, and he placed him
[46:25] there to dress it and to keep it. But he
[46:27] gave him a commandment and he gave him
[46:29] this commission, but it was under
[46:31] condition. You can have anything you
[46:33] want in here, but don't touch this tree.
[46:35] So that was a covenant with God, a man,
[46:37] but it was a conditional
[46:39] covenant. Then there was another
[46:41] covenant that he made one time in
[46:42] Genesis 9. After the flood, he made a
[46:45] covenant with Noah and every living
[46:47] creature. And that covenant was that he
[46:49] would never destroy the earth again with
[46:51] a flood. And he made a token, a sign in
[46:53] the heavens of his covenant that he
[46:55] would keep his promise. And that
[46:57] covenant token was the rainbow. So that
[46:59] when it rains, the rainbow is the token
[47:01] of God's covenant that he's going to
[47:03] keep his promise. So a covenant is a
[47:06] pledge. It's a promise. It's an
[47:09] agreement. And so God has been getting
[47:12] in covenants with man all down through
[47:15] time. Then later on in the book of
[47:17] Genesis, he would come into another
[47:19] covenant with another man. And that
[47:20] covenant was with Abraham. Only this
[47:23] time, this wasn't a conditional
[47:25] covenant. Because we know that Adam was
[47:27] under a conditional covenant. When Adam
[47:29] broke the conditions of the covenant,
[47:31] the covenant was broken and now he would
[47:33] die. And now he would no longer be ruler
[47:36] over the earth. But when God came to
[47:39] Abraham, he comes to Abraham and says,
[47:40] "I give you an unconditional covenant."
[47:43] And here's what Paul says in Hebrews 6.
[47:46] For when God made promise to Abraham,
[47:48] because he would swear by no greater, he
[47:51] swear by himself, saying, "Surely
[47:53] blessing I will bless thee, and
[47:55] multiplying I will multiply thee." And
[47:58] so after he had patiently endured, he
[47:59] obtained the promise. For men verilely
[48:02] swear by the greater, and an oath for
[48:03] confirmation is to them an end of all
[48:05] strife, wherein God willing more
[48:07] abundantly to show unto the heirs of
[48:09] promise the immutability of his counsel,
[48:12] confirmed it by an oath, that by two
[48:14] immutable things in which it is
[48:16] impossible for God to lie, we might have
[48:19] strong consolation, who have fled for
[48:20] refuge, to lay hold upon the hope set
[48:23] before us, which hope we have as an
[48:25] anchor of the soul, both sure and
[48:27] steadfast, and which enterth enterth
[48:30] into that within the veil. So when God
[48:32] made a covenant, he based the covenant
[48:34] on two immutable things. One, his
[48:37] counsel will never change and one, his
[48:38] word would never fail. And he made an
[48:40] oath based upon himself. Here's what the
[48:43] prophet of God says. He says he had a
[48:45] covenant with Adam, the first man on
[48:47] earth. And that covenant was on
[48:49] conditions. If you do so and so, I'll do
[48:52] so and so. And Adam would have something
[48:54] to do in order to keep his covenant
[48:56] alive before God. He had to walk in
[48:58] God's ways, keeping all of his word, not
[49:01] breaking one word. But then he made
[49:03] another covenant, and that was with
[49:05] Abraham. This covenant was not on
[49:07] conditions, but was unconditionally. God
[49:10] gave the covenant to Abraham. No strings
[49:13] tied to it at all. Unconditionally, not
[49:15] I will, I have, I've already done it. So
[49:19] that's the difference between a
[49:20] conditional and an unconditional
[49:22] covenant. But what you guys are going to
[49:24] enter into now is the marriage covenant.
[49:28] And you guys are going to make a
[49:29] covenant with one another. Brother Alex,
[49:31] you'll make a covenant. Sister Amy and
[49:33] Sister M. You'll make a covenant or a
[49:35] pledge back to Alex. And this is an
[49:38] unconditional covenant like the one God
[49:41] made with Abraham. We already read part
[49:44] of that when I asked you your intent.
[49:47] When we first got up here, I asked you.
[49:49] I asked Alex. I said, 'ould you take uh
[49:52] Amy to be your wedded wife to live
[49:54] together after God's ordinance in the
[49:55] holy state of matrimony? Will you love
[49:58] her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in
[50:00] sickness and in health, forsaking all
[50:02] others, keep yourself only under her so
[50:04] long as you both shall live? And you
[50:06] already answered positive to that. You
[50:09] said you
[50:10] will. That promise that you made wasn't
[50:14] based on any conduct of Amy. It had
[50:17] nothing to do with Amy except she was
[50:19] the object of your pledge. But it was
[50:22] based on your promise alone. It wasn't
[50:25] based on how well Amy performed or on
[50:29] anything any merit of yours. It was
[50:31] based purely on your pledge to her. That
[50:34] was an unconditional covenant. Later
[50:38] we'll come to the vows. When you make a
[50:39] vow to one another and your vow will say
[50:43] that you you promise to take one another
[50:47] to have and to hold from this day
[50:48] forward for better for worse for rich or
[50:51] for poor in sickness and in health to
[50:53] love and to cherish till death do us
[50:55] part according to God's holy ordinance
[50:58] and there too I give thee my pledge.
[51:00] That also is an unconditional covenant.
[51:03] It doesn't say I will if you will. I
[51:07] promise. If you promise, all you said
[51:10] was, "I will. I will take you to be my
[51:13] wife. I will from this day forward, for
[51:16] better, for worse, under every
[51:18] circumstance, I won't change my pledge."
[51:20] This is a mirror of the pledge that God
[51:23] made to us. And that pledge is based on
[51:26] one thing. It's based on love. It's a
[51:29] pledge based on love. In the book of
[51:33] Malachi, they wondered, they were asking
[51:35] God, "How do you love us?" The Jews had
[51:37] a question. They didn't understand God's
[51:39] love. He says, "I love loved you, sayeth
[51:41] the Lord. Yet you say, "Wherein hast
[51:43] thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's
[51:46] brother, sayeth the Lord, yet I love
[51:48] Jacob." And Paul picks it up in Romans 9
[51:51] and he says, ' And not only this, but
[51:53] when Bre Rebecca also conceived one by
[51:55] even our father Isaac. For the children
[51:58] being not yet born, neither having done
[52:00] any good or evil, that the purpose of
[52:01] God according to election might stand,
[52:04] not of works, but of him that calleth.
[52:06] It was said unto her, the elder shall
[52:08] serve the younger, as it is written,
[52:09] Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
[52:12] hated. And this is what the prophet says
[52:14] according to the scripture. says, "Let
[52:17] us examine the first phrase, as many as
[52:19] I love." He's speaking here in the book
[52:21] of Revelations. In the Greek, the
[52:24] emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I.
[52:26] He does not say as many would feel. He
[52:28] should say as many as love me. No, sir.
[52:31] We must never try to make Jesus the
[52:33] object of human love in this verse. No,
[52:35] it is the many that are the loved ones
[52:37] of God. It is his love in question, not
[52:40] ours. So once again we find ourselves
[52:43] gloring in his salvation, his purpose,
[52:46] his plan and we are confirmed even more
[52:48] strongly in the truth of doctrine of the
[52:50] sovereignty of God. Later he goes on to
[52:53] say this love is elective love. It is
[52:56] his love for his elect and his love for
[52:58] them is apart from human merit. For it
[53:01] says that the purpose of God stands in
[53:03] election which is exactly opposite to
[53:05] works or anything man has in himself.
[53:08] Because before the children were born,
[53:10] he had already said, "Jacob have I
[53:12] loved, and Esau have I hated." So God's
[53:15] covenant with man was based off God's
[53:18] love for man. God's love for his elect,
[53:21] for his chosen. And Alex, your pledge to
[53:25] Amy is based on
[53:27] love. Amen. I remember so long ago,
[53:31] about five
[53:35] months when you two met at a coffee
[53:38] maker in our house, and everybody could
[53:42] see that a flame had burst and erupted
[53:46] into a bonfire. And by the end of the
[53:48] evening, it was obvious that the sparks
[53:51] were flying. And so, here we stand just
[53:54] a mere five months later. And within
[53:57] that time, of course, you had known each
[53:58] other before, but you hadn't started
[54:00] your relationship until January 1st,
[54:04] 2025. And I'm so privileged to have seen
[54:06] it. We were all whispering and giving
[54:08] each other
[54:09] eyes and actually moving around you as
[54:12] you took up all the space at the coffee
[54:16] maker, oblivious to the rest of the
[54:18] world. But that was wonderful.
[54:21] But it was that spark that was that
[54:23] knowing. It was that connection that
[54:26] began that that knowing, that love. And
[54:29] in five months time, you've got to a
[54:31] place where you'll make an unconditional
[54:34] promise for life. That you've gone from
[54:38] just knowing one another and knowing
[54:40] about one another to actually building a
[54:42] relationship to where you're so
[54:44] convinced that this is God's plan for
[54:46] you. You're so convinced this is your
[54:48] wife and you're so convinced this is
[54:49] your husband that you'll stand before
[54:51] friends and family and you'll make a
[54:52] pledge. You'll make a promise and that
[54:54] promise has no plan B. There's no
[54:57] escaping that promise. There's no clause
[54:59] in the vows for I will unless you do. I
[55:04] will until you do. But that's not what
[55:06] you promised each other. Your promise is
[55:08] I will in sickness and in health, in
[55:11] good times and in bad times. I will.
[55:13] I'll be faithful to you. I'll be true to
[55:15] you. I'll stay with you. I'll forsake
[55:17] all others and stay with you until one
[55:20] of us leaves this earth till death do us
[55:22] part. That's the only way that this
[55:24] covenant can be broke. And you made it
[55:27] based on love. Love made you so
[55:30] confident that you would be willing to
[55:33] take a lifelong pledge pledge to one
[55:35] another. Amen. That's the power of love.
[55:37] And that's human love. And if that's if
[55:40] that's how powerful your love is for one
[55:41] another, how much more powerful is God's
[55:43] love which is permanent and perfect and
[55:46] he was able to make a pledge before we
[55:48] were born and came to this earth that he
[55:51] will love us and he will never forsake
[55:53] us and he will never lose us. So your
[55:56] pledge is just mirroring God's great
[55:59] pledge. Amen.
[56:02] the the condition for the for the pledge
[56:06] is based on love, not on merit or
[56:10] behavior. When uh when the flames
[56:13] erupted at the coffee maker, it wasn't
[56:16] because Amy turned in the resume and she
[56:19] had all the qualifications. You didn't
[56:21] tick off all the boxes. No, there was
[56:23] something else going on. You found your
[56:26] counterpart. You found a match. You
[56:28] found a complimentary piece that fit.
[56:30] And you begin to realize it. It become
[56:32] became obvious. Amen. So it was
[56:35] something more than accolades. It was
[56:39] something more than achievements. It was
[56:41] something more than degrees, financial
[56:44] status, or position in life. That wasn't
[56:47] based off merit. It wasn't based off
[56:49] performance. It began with love. In 2
[56:53] Timothy 1:9 it says, "Who hath saved us
[56:55] and called us with a holy calling, not
[56:57] according to our works, but according to
[57:00] his own purpose and grace which was
[57:02] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[57:04] world
[57:04] began." In Deuteronomy 7, God speaks to
[57:08] the children of Israel in the Exodus
[57:11] says, "For thou art a holy people unto
[57:12] the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God has
[57:15] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[57:17] himself above all people that are upon
[57:19] the face of the earth. The Lord did not
[57:21] set his love upon you, nor choose you,
[57:24] because you were more in number than any
[57:26] people, for you were the fewest of all
[57:27] people. But because the Lord loved you,
[57:30] and because he he would keep the oath
[57:32] which he has sworn unto your fathers,
[57:35] hath the Lord brought you out with a
[57:37] mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the
[57:39] house of bondman from the hand of
[57:41] Pharaoh, king of Egypt. So why did God
[57:45] set his love on them? Not because they
[57:46] were the most, not because they were the
[57:48] greatest, because at the time he called
[57:49] them out, they were slaves. So it wasn't
[57:52] their merit, but it was his love that he
[57:53] set upon them and his promise and his
[57:56] oath. And then the unconditional
[57:59] covenant that God gives to us is not
[58:02] based on our strength because we have
[58:04] none. His covenant and promise to the
[58:07] seed of Abraham is based on his
[58:09] strength, on his unfailing commitment.
[58:12] And so your covenant to one another is
[58:15] not based on the strength of the other.
[58:17] So Alex, your covenant to Amy is not
[58:19] based on her merit or her strength and
[58:21] is not tied to performance, failure, or
[58:24] success. It's only tied to the merit of
[58:26] your love and commitment to her. So
[58:29] you're not asking her to keep your
[58:31] covenant. You've promised to do it based
[58:33] on your own strength and your own love.
[58:36] But Amy, you'll ple make a pledge back
[58:38] to Alex. And you're not asking him for
[58:41] strength to keep the covenant. You've
[58:43] promised to do it regardless of his
[58:45] merit, regardless of his conduct,
[58:47] regardless of his behavior. And you
[58:49] promised for life. That's the power of
[58:52] love. That's what binds you together.
[58:55] That's what gives you the courage to
[58:56] make this kind of covenant. Ephesians
[58:59] 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved
[59:02] through faith, and that not of
[59:03] yourselves, it is the gift of God, not
[59:05] of works, lest any man should boast."
[59:08] This is grace. This is God's unmmerited
[59:10] favor to us. Not because we would get
[59:12] things right, because we always got it
[59:14] wrong. Man has always failed. That's why
[59:16] God would have to have an unconditional
[59:18] covenant because he knew we would not
[59:20] always get it right. But he was pretty
[59:22] sure because of the fall, we would
[59:24] always get it wrong. So, he couldn't
[59:26] make the covenant based off our
[59:28] performance and our conduct because then
[59:30] the covenant would be broken. So, he had
[59:32] to base it on himself, his promise, his
[59:35] strength, and his love. That's why you
[59:37] can't base your covenant on the
[59:39] performance of one another, but only on
[59:41] your promise to each other. And in doing
[59:44] so, you'll reflect the great love that
[59:46] God has for us. That he loves us in
[59:49] sickness and in health. He loves us for
[59:52] rich or poor. He loves us when we do
[59:54] well, and he loves us when we don't do
[59:56] well. He loves us when we're performing
[59:58] well. He loves us when we're
[59:59] underperforming as well because he set
[1:00:02] his love on us because his love is
[1:00:03] elective. Alex, your love for Amy was
[1:00:07] elective. You chose her. Something about
[1:00:10] her fit you and you knew she was the
[1:00:12] one. And you chose her and you proposed
[1:00:14] to her. But Amy, you had to accept his
[1:00:18] choice. It had to also be your choice.
[1:00:21] You had to choose back. No matter how
[1:00:23] much he loved you, no matter how much he
[1:00:24] was willing to make a covenant with you,
[1:00:26] you had to have faith that he loved you.
[1:00:29] You had to have faith that he was the
[1:00:31] one and that you were his counterpart.
[1:00:32] and you had to accept that invitation.
[1:00:35] It's the same thing for us in Christ. In
[1:00:38] Ephesians 1, it says, "Blessed be the
[1:00:41] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:00:43] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:00:44] blessings in heavenly places in Christ,
[1:00:47] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:00:49] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:00:51] we should be holy and without blame
[1:00:53] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:00:56] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:00:58] Jesus Christ to himself, according to
[1:01:00] the good pleasure of his will, to the
[1:01:02] praise of the glory of the grace,
[1:01:04] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:01:06] beloved.
[1:01:08] He didn't choose us because we were
[1:01:10] great, but his choice made us accepted
[1:01:13] in the
[1:01:15] beloved. God is only looking for one
[1:01:17] thing from us, and that's to accept his
[1:01:20] love for us. To have faith in his
[1:01:24] willingness to make a covenant with us
[1:01:26] and choose us. And that faith that we
[1:01:28] have in us is an expression of the faith
[1:01:31] of Abraham, to believe God, to receive
[1:01:34] his word, and to receive his covenant.
[1:01:37] So then for us that are in union with
[1:01:40] Christ or want to be in union with
[1:01:41] Christ, he has made a pledge. He's made
[1:01:43] a promise for the seed of Abraham and
[1:01:45] he's only looking for somebody who will
[1:01:47] accept it. Somebody who will receive it.
[1:01:49] His elect, his love, the recipients of
[1:01:52] his love. Alex found that in you and you
[1:01:56] were very willing to
[1:01:59] accept. I believe Christ has found that
[1:02:01] many of us and we were very willing to
[1:02:04] accept. He found his counterpart, the
[1:02:06] token of his love, the object of his
[1:02:08] love. He had made a promise and
[1:02:10] something in us could accept it. And so
[1:02:14] what kind of love should we have for
[1:02:18] Christ? If he had this kind of love for
[1:02:21] us, what kind of love should we have
[1:02:22] back to him? I believe it should be an
[1:02:25] unconditional love. Not just because he
[1:02:27] showers us with blessings or because
[1:02:29] everything in life goes right or because
[1:02:31] he always makes everything work out. But
[1:02:33] I think we should love him even when
[1:02:34] things don't work out. We should love
[1:02:36] him in good times and in bad times. We
[1:02:38] should love him in richer and in poor.
[1:02:41] We should give back to him the same kind
[1:02:43] of love he gave to us. Not just wanting
[1:02:46] him to give us t tokens and affection
[1:02:48] and blessings, but he loved us. He first
[1:02:52] loved us so that we could love him. And
[1:02:55] so God gave us an
[1:02:57] unconditional promise, an unconditional
[1:02:59] covenant. And I want to give him back
[1:03:02] love without
[1:03:03] condition. Alex, your pledge to Amy will
[1:03:07] be an unconditional pledge. But I think
[1:03:10] in response, Amy will give you an
[1:03:12] unconditional pledge. and in good times
[1:03:16] and in bad times when things go well,
[1:03:18] when things don't go well, when you when
[1:03:21] you bless each other and sometimes
[1:03:23] you'll disappoint one another. But don't
[1:03:25] forget the power of love and the power
[1:03:27] of your covenant. That Alex, if you're
[1:03:32] disappointed, if something doesn't go
[1:03:34] right, don't forget your covenant. Don't
[1:03:37] forget why you made the covenant. And
[1:03:40] don't forget, your covenant wasn't based
[1:03:42] on anything that Amy would do or not do.
[1:03:45] It was only based on your love for her.
[1:03:48] And you are very willing to make that
[1:03:50] covenant. Same thing for you, Amy. There
[1:03:53] may be times of disappointment or
[1:03:54] discouragement or times when things go
[1:03:56] well and times when they don't go well.
[1:03:58] But don't forget the strength of your
[1:04:00] covenant is based off your love, not
[1:04:02] performance, not merit. There are other
[1:04:06] people that can do great things and have
[1:04:08] great achievements, but that's not why
[1:04:10] you loved her. Not for her achievements,
[1:04:12] not for her merit. You loved her because
[1:04:14] you loved her. Period. Amy, it's the
[1:04:18] same thing for Alex. You may find
[1:04:21] somebody who can do something that he
[1:04:23] does better, but you didn't do you
[1:04:25] didn't love him because of his
[1:04:27] performance. You loved him because of
[1:04:28] him, and you were willing to enter this
[1:04:31] covenant. So, if you still are in
[1:04:33] agreement and you want to make this
[1:04:34] covenant, it'd be a pleasure for me to
[1:04:37] help you exchange your vows. Now, if
[1:04:38] you'd like to turn and face one another.
[1:04:44] Alex, if you could look at Amy and
[1:04:46] repeat after me,
[1:04:48] please. I, Alex, I, Alex, take thee,
[1:04:52] Amy, take the Amy, to be my wedded wife.

[1:11:00] work, Lord, and a picture of what you're
[1:11:02] doing for us all as you unite your bride
[1:11:04] together with yourself. Lord, may your
[1:11:06] blessing be upon this marriage. May they
[1:11:08] be a reflection of that great gospel
[1:11:10] story. May you shield them, protect
[1:11:13] them, shelter them from all the ws of
[1:11:15] the enemy. Lord, may you shine a bright
[1:11:17] light in them, and may you bless the
[1:11:19] fruit of their union. May you bless
[1:11:20] their home and all that you have for
[1:11:22] them to do. May they go forth from here,
[1:11:24] Lord, as one under your shelter, under
[1:11:26] your protection, and may your Holy
[1:11:28] Spirit be their guide in all things. We
[1:11:31] ask it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:11:36] Amen. For as much as you, Alex and Amy,
[1:11:39] have consented together in holy wedlock,
[1:11:42] and have witnessed the same before God
[1:11:43] in this congregation, and in so doing
[1:11:46] have given and pledged your vows to each
[1:11:48] other, and have declared the same by the
