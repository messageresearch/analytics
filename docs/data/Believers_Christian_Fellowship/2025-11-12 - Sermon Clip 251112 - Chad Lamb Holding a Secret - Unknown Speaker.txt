========================================

It doesn't matter what other people think about you. It doesn't matter what other people say about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your vindication are the tokens that you hold in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where did you get them? Where did you get this message? Listen, we didn't get this message from William Brandham. &gt;&gt; We got this message from Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Where did you get your token? That token didn't come Amen. just through from a preacher somewhere or a church. That token came from Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one who has impregnated us. He's the one who's come in union with us. He's the one who's given us these tokens. And we received them from his hand. Why? Cuz we didn't want money. We're not a harlot. We didn't want a lustful nothing. What we wanted was redemption, the word, the truth, a restoration. The same thing Tamar was hungering for. She may not have understood the hunger. I believe there was a spiritual hunger driving her. But friends, there's a spiritual hunger driving us to this word and to this token. &gt;&gt; AND ANYTIME SOMEBODY BECOMES DRIVEN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY BECOME AN ANOMALY. They become an outcast. They become SOMETHING STRANGE TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; They're willing to do strange things. Tamar was willing to do something very strange. Amen. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THE REDEMPTION PLAN, TO BE PART of the word coming forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She was willing TO DO SOMETHING SO UNUSUAL. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY A FORCE. SHE HAD TO PLAY THE PART. SHE HAD TO RECEIVE THE SEED. SHE HAD TO BRING FORTH AND AND PRESERVE the lineage of Judah. It was MORE THAN THE THOUGHTS OF A WOMAN. AMEN. IT WAS THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD THAT WERE DRIVING HER. AND FRIENDS, YOU AND I are driven by more than just our own desires and our own thoughts. There's a SEED GENE OF GOD INSIDE OF YOU PROGRAMMED TO REACH OUT FOR THIS SIGNATE RING TO REACH OUT FOR THIS LORD JESUS CHRIST AND SAY I'VE GOT TO HAVE THE SEED AND PLANTED IN ME. I'VE GOT TO COME INTO UNION WITH HIM. I'M HERE. AMEN. TO BRING FORTH THE PROMISED SON &gt;&gt; OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. &gt;&gt; I'M ON THIS EARTH. [screaming] AMEN. IT'S FOR ME TO DO. &gt;&gt; YEAH. It's for ME TO BRING FORTH THE SON OF man again.
