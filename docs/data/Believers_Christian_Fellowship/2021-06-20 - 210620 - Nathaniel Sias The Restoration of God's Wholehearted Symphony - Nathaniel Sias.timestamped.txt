[6:03] lord jesus if that is our prayer
[6:07] today truly lord from the bottom of our
[6:11] hearts
[6:12] that you would be glorified in our lives
[6:16] not just in the four walls of this
[6:18] building
[6:20] lord we come to hear your word and to be
[6:21] encouraged but the effect lord
[6:24] is supposed to be at home it's supposed
[6:27] to be at work
[6:29] it's supposed to be in the middle of our
[6:31] trials
[6:33] for lord as your word takes root
[6:36] lord you begin to have an effect
[6:39] and you are glorified in our lives
[6:43] not just twice a week not just when
[6:46] we're feeling spiritual
[6:49] but all day every day
[6:52] lord i pray that for us today that we
[6:54] would have a greater vision as we go
[6:56] from this place
[6:58] god we take every spirit under our
[7:00] control lord
[7:02] that you might be glorified here in the
[7:03] few moments of fellowship that we have
[7:05] together
[7:07] that the words that would be spoken
[7:10] would be pleasing in your eyes
[7:13] that the words that would be spoken
[7:15] would be received in the hearts of your
[7:17] people
[7:18] for lord is you that quickens the word
[7:20] to be spoken it's also you that must
[7:21] quicken the word
[7:22] to be heard god be with us in a few
[7:26] minutes of fellowship we have
[7:27] and in jesus christ's name we commit our
[7:29] time into your hands
[7:31] amen praise the lord
[7:35] lord bless you saints it's wonderful to
[7:37] be together with you today
[7:39] amen it's been a little uh little season
[7:43] since we've been able to have some
[7:44] fellowship and
[7:46] you know it's such a wonderful thing to
[7:47] be able to see the saints that are still
[7:49] pressing on
[7:51] anybody had a trial recently
[7:55] amen we're getting shaped up for better
[7:58] things
[7:59] you know nothing is without purpose and
[8:01] nothing is by accident
[8:03] praise the lord we're going to take a
[8:04] look at a little thought here today
[8:07] or just uh by god's grace maybe not keep
[8:09] you too long but
[8:11] this little thought is a kind of a long
[8:13] title but i wanted to
[8:15] what was in my heart was to capture
[8:16] really the thought here and
[8:18] this is the restoration of god's
[8:20] wholehearted symphony
[8:23] i i you know much prefer to have a
[8:26] real as we would say a little snappy
[8:28] little title one or two words you know
[8:31] but sometimes we have to be specific
[8:34] and there's a lot of things that god is
[8:36] doing and we're at a time a season
[8:40] where maybe there was a time where it
[8:41] was okay to be a little off to the left
[8:43] a little off to the right
[8:44] but we're not in that season anymore
[8:48] god is calling for all things to be in
[8:50] such wonderful
[8:51] perfect order as we face our trials
[8:54] they're not trials anymore
[8:56] just an experience that we're going
[8:58] through that god would be glorified
[9:00] when we come to church it's no longer
[9:02] about fulfilling some sort of form
[9:06] it's about having a relationship with
[9:07] god having communion with god
[9:11] and when we're praying at home we come
[9:12] to church we come to a church service
[9:15] and we hear the the secret things that
[9:17] we were praying about at home
[9:19] spoken over the pulpit are those things
[9:23] really possible
[9:24] yes friends every time we come to a
[9:27] church service
[9:28] anything is possible
[9:32] anything is possible which means that
[9:35] today anything
[9:37] is possible if we can simply
[9:40] trust the author and the finisher of our
[9:42] faith to do the work from beginning to
[9:44] end
[9:44] and humble ourselves to his word all
[9:47] things will be in order
[9:49] better than we could possibly imagine
[9:52] praise the lord
[9:58] now i feel like my kids when we're at
[10:00] home
[10:02] when they experience a computer that
[10:03] doesn't have a touch screen they don't
[10:04] know what to do
[10:08] i think i might use the clicker here
[10:10] there we go beautiful
[10:12] so here's a few references for you today
[10:14] we'll read a scripture i have you be
[10:15] seated and then we'll bring this back up
[10:17] so you can make some notes if you like
[10:19] let's turn to psalm 111 if you would if
[10:21] you've got your bibles with you
[10:24] i want to say happy father's day to all
[10:26] the fathers here
[10:33] there are only a couple things in life
[10:36] that will make you grow like being a
[10:37] father or a mother
[10:40] you will grow in patience you will grow
[10:43] in temperance
[10:46] god designed it so you know and as we go
[10:50] through those times it's just a wonder
[10:52] as
[10:52] wonderful as a father as you see the
[10:55] little things that
[10:56] come out of your children you know all
[10:58] the mistakes that we make all
[11:00] day you know all the time we're always
[11:01] making little mistakes but you know it's
[11:03] the grace of god that brings the
[11:04] wonderful things out of our children
[11:07] because we can only do what we can do
[11:09] and like like the little boy that
[11:10] brought the fishes and the loaves we
[11:11] bring everything we have
[11:13] and then the lord multiplies it and
[11:14] sometimes we're teaching our children
[11:16] bible verses and we're praying with them
[11:18] and then suddenly you're not feeling
[11:19] well
[11:21] and it's your five-year-old that comes
[11:23] to you and says daddy can i pray with
[11:24] you
[11:27] see not all investments take a long time
[11:29] to come around
[11:31] it's wonderful to invest in the right
[11:33] things as a father
[11:35] as a mother praise the lord the lord is
[11:37] just so good
[11:39] let's read here in psalm 111 we're just
[11:42] going to read verse number one and i'll
[11:43] have you be seated psalm 111 verse
[11:47] number 1
[11:48] praise ye the lord i will praise the
[11:51] lord with my whole heart
[11:54] in the assembly of the upright and in
[11:57] the congregation
[11:58] may the lord bless the word you may be
[12:00] seated
[12:02] i believe in for many of us maybe this
[12:04] is a familiar
[12:05] verse and it's kind of used in a
[12:09] specific context this is something that
[12:11] the lord has been dealing with me
[12:13] over the last probably a year and a half
[12:16] or two years is that
[12:18] many times we are familiar with
[12:20] scripture
[12:21] and we look at the scripture in a
[12:22] certain way in a certain light
[12:25] maybe we've been taught that maybe it's
[12:26] just our own perception we've read a
[12:28] verse
[12:29] and it kind of struck us a certain way
[12:30] and we form a picture
[12:32] in our mind and a lot of times
[12:35] it actually takes a lot of pressure that
[12:38] the lord will allow us to go through
[12:40] to begin to break the perceptions that
[12:42] we have
[12:43] of scripture because see god had it
[12:46] perfect in the beginning he hasn't
[12:47] changed his mind from that
[12:49] and we sometimes apply our own idea to
[12:52] the scripture
[12:54] no we don't do it intentionally so you
[12:55] might say to me well brother nathaniel
[12:57] we came out of the denomination we set
[12:59] our
[12:59] our mind aside we set all the
[13:01] denominational ideas aside
[13:03] but you know that's true and we praise
[13:05] the lord for that all that god has done
[13:07] but as we sit here today when we read a
[13:09] scripture there are certain things that
[13:11] come to mind
[13:13] as we read this scripture here there are
[13:15] certain things that come to mind and
[13:17] and we it is very easy to read that
[13:19] scripture and say well praise the lord
[13:20] that's about worship
[13:21] at the beginning of the service or the
[13:23] end of the service
[13:24] maybe that that scripture is
[13:26] specifically for musicians
[13:28] because it has a reference to praising
[13:32] the lord
[13:34] and it is these types of things that
[13:36] suddenly where god has spoken something
[13:38] that is profound
[13:39] we then put it in a box we don't intend
[13:41] to do it
[13:42] we don't mean to do it but we all do
[13:46] we're all in the same boat as i like to
[13:47] say we're all in the same boat bailing
[13:49] water
[13:51] you know we get some confident in
[13:52] ourselves right sometimes we think
[13:55] that we've got it figured out and again
[13:57] this is not about
[13:58] uh really being puffed up in pride
[14:00] they're just assumptions that we make
[14:03] because of experiences because of things
[14:06] that we've heard preached
[14:07] because of things again maybe we're
[14:09] praying we're reading in a scripture and
[14:10] it strikes us a certain way
[14:11] and maybe that was good for that season
[14:14] but then god comes along and he says
[14:16] see now you think you know that
[14:20] but now i want to open it to you in
[14:22] another way
[14:23] that you've never seen before
[14:27] and this as we begin to read the
[14:29] scripture and i encourage you saints as
[14:31] you go from here today
[14:32] if i can encourage you in anything let
[14:34] me encourage you in this that when you
[14:36] go home and begin to read your bible
[14:37] begin to read your bible like you've
[14:39] never read it before
[14:41] read every verse lay aside every thought
[14:43] you have
[14:44] and begin to read that verse when you
[14:47] listen to the message
[14:48] listen to the message as if you've never
[14:50] heard it before
[14:54] and suddenly the lord begins to open up
[14:57] brand new things that we thought well
[14:58] they're new to us but there they were
[15:00] all the time
[15:01] and that which we thought well yeah i'm
[15:03] kind of familiar with that part
[15:05] the lord begins to open it up and we
[15:06] begin to see how it now
[15:08] it doesn't just fit in a small way it
[15:10] begins to fit in the tapestry
[15:12] of god's time of god's timeline in this
[15:15] larger scene
[15:16] and this excuse me this one little verse
[15:19] can fit right into that picture
[15:20] and be a missing piece
[15:24] and without it things don't connect
[15:28] this is the the sincerity and the
[15:30] honesty and this the simplicity
[15:32] that we want to look at the scriptures
[15:35] so here is a a few things that brother
[15:37] brandon was referring to
[15:38] a couple pictures that he gave us um
[15:41] here in uh
[15:42] look in shalom
[15:45] look shalom and then the world is
[15:46] falling excuse me the falling apart of
[15:48] the world
[15:49] there's a couple references he makes
[15:50] here we're not going to pull
[15:53] extensively from here as far as coding
[15:55] up on the screen
[15:56] but there's some of the thoughts that
[15:57] are in the this this message today
[15:59] are coming from these messages so if you
[16:02] want to make a note they're very
[16:03] encouraging if you're not familiar with
[16:04] them already but even if you are
[16:06] familiar with them
[16:08] i encourage you to go back and listen
[16:12] wonderful saints the mind cannot
[16:15] conceive the things that god has in
[16:18] store
[16:20] still well brother we've got a wonderful
[16:23] revelation praise the lord there's more
[16:26] this isn't stagnant it's not over yet
[16:30] things are still getting sweeter they're
[16:32] getting deeper they're getting more
[16:33] profound they're getting so
[16:35] personal that at home you can just have
[16:38] a conversation
[16:39] looking at what god has done praise the
[16:41] lord and when you begin to worship
[16:42] it's not about well i'm gonna worship
[16:44] for a half hour be before the preaching
[16:46] on wednesday and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[16:48] praise the lord for a half hour before
[16:50] the the preaching on sunday and then
[16:53] maybe
[16:54] maybe 20 or 30 minutes after the service
[16:56] so i've got two hours of praise every
[16:57] week
[16:59] oh my we've already put god in such a
[17:03] tiny
[17:04] little box he's worthy of praise
[17:07] from the moment that we wake up to the
[17:09] the moment that we lay our head
[17:11] on the pillow at night every moment of
[17:14] every day
[17:15] he is worthy for us to praise him for
[17:17] all that he
[17:18] is and with all that we have
[17:22] and i don't mean 99.99
[17:25] 100 he's worthy of it all
[17:34] the whole heart
[17:38] let's go to if you would joel the second
[17:44] chapter
[17:46] i realized that many people are
[17:48] traveling today
[17:51] and sometimes that can be discouraging
[17:53] to us because we look around and we say
[17:55] well so-and-so is not here and so and so
[17:57] is not here
[18:00] the scripture still says where two or
[18:01] three are gathered
[18:03] so don't let that take your mind or
[18:05] discourage you or pull you down today
[18:12] my god is so good so we're going to
[18:15] hit a couple points here and then by
[18:17] god's grace try to bring this together
[18:19] and
[18:19] you know it's been quite a while since
[18:22] i've had to fight so much for a sermon
[18:25] this last couple days there's many
[18:27] things going on and i would love to have
[18:29] spent a couple days and just kind of
[18:31] kind of set aside and be quiet but
[18:33] unfortunately in today's world we don't
[18:34] have that
[18:36] you know by god's grace have a little
[18:37] time here and a little time there and
[18:40] you know it really does just remind us
[18:42] that we have to trust the lord when we
[18:43] stand behind this
[18:44] this holy desk here you know we can't
[18:47] figure everything out
[18:49] you know as a minister we're not at home
[18:51] practice practicing our sermons in the
[18:53] mirror
[18:54] well now at this point we're going to
[18:56] say this at this point we're going to
[18:57] say that
[18:58] no we got to show up and trust the lord
[19:01] and truly saints as we come to listen
[19:04] [Music]
[19:05] when we sit in an audience such as this
[19:07] this is no lesser
[19:09] for you to be sitting in that seat right
[19:10] there that's no lesser of a role
[19:14] than standing up here don't forget that
[19:18] you are what this is about
[19:21] this is god's intent is you
[19:24] all of this is about you
[19:28] let's read here in joel the second
[19:30] chapter
[19:32] verse number 25
[19:37] and i will restore to you the years that
[19:39] the locust has eaten and the canker worm
[19:41] and the caterpillar
[19:43] and the palmer worm my great army which
[19:45] i sent among you
[19:48] you shall eat and plenty be satisfied
[19:52] and praise the name of the lord your god
[19:55] that hath
[19:56] dealt wondrously with you
[20:00] and my people shall never be ashamed
[20:07] again many of us may be familiar
[20:11] with this verse
[20:15] there is a law in christ that law
[20:19] is in men you can bury him in the
[20:22] deepest grave or the deepest sea
[20:24] or the lowest hell there's a law of the
[20:28] spirit of god that will raise him up
[20:29] again
[20:30] see okay well it's a law
[20:38] no matter what happens
[20:42] no matter what
[20:46] we can say the words but when god makes
[20:50] that real to us
[20:53] it changes us entirely
[20:58] no matter what
[21:01] there is nothing that can change
[21:05] the law of life
[21:09] when god planted a seed and sent it into
[21:11] the world
[21:12] that seed of him that seed
[21:17] has no option we serve god god put us
[21:20] in this world and he does not overcome
[21:22] free will here we we he
[21:24] he brings us uh the the message is
[21:26] presented to us his word is presented to
[21:28] us
[21:28] we have a decision to make we make the
[21:29] decision but god knew the decision that
[21:31] we would make
[21:33] he knew who we were he knew the
[21:35] character that was in that seed
[21:37] and he knew what the character would do
[21:41] but god set it in order he sent the seed
[21:44] there
[21:44] and there is a law that governs the seed
[21:47] no matter what the situation no matter
[21:50] how
[21:51] big the circumstances of the world no
[21:53] matter how loud the devil gets
[21:55] no matter how how crazy the world gets
[21:58] no matter how low the morality of the
[22:00] world
[22:02] it doesn't change the law of life
[22:07] it doesn't matter throughout the church
[22:08] ages it didn't matter how much the devil
[22:11] attempted to corrupt that which god was
[22:14] working
[22:16] it didn't change it no did it hinder
[22:18] into the work well
[22:19] god had already said this was going to
[22:21] take place so as
[22:23] brother branham says of jonah we look at
[22:25] jonah and say well jonah you know
[22:26] he just had a weak moment and brother
[22:28] brandon says now let me take up for
[22:30] jonah
[22:31] because even when jonah was in what we
[22:33] would think is a bad state
[22:35] he was in the perfect will of god
[22:38] because god had set in motion something
[22:41] that would come to pass
[22:42] at the designated time and here we are
[22:45] going to the world and we get the woe is
[22:47] me's
[22:47] we get the woe is this and what was that
[22:49] and what was covent and what was
[22:51] politics and what was that
[22:52] but the law of life has not changed
[22:57] when god planted life life must come up
[23:03] we used a very simple example if you've
[23:04] got a pear tree and you plant the
[23:06] the pear what must come up well the same
[23:08] is true of an apple seed
[23:10] but if we plant a a tree of life what
[23:13] must come up
[23:14] if we plant a tree of knowledge of good
[23:17] and evil what must come up
[23:20] and we want to focus on this just for a
[23:22] moment to understand
[23:24] this is not optional it's not optional
[23:28] what's going to come next
[23:29] because it's a law of god it is an
[23:31] absolute
[23:32] god said this is the law it is a law of
[23:36] life
[23:36] it is a law that when the devil tries to
[23:38] destroy that the law of life will
[23:41] restore
[23:43] and it's not optional no matter what the
[23:46] devil tries to present
[23:48] it's not an option i'm emphasizing this
[23:50] for a reason
[23:53] that we will know an absolute it is not
[23:56] negotiable
[23:57] it is not a 99 chance
[24:00] it's a hundred every time
[24:04] god's law of life will overcome
[24:06] everything that the devil
[24:08] puts in front of it every piece of death
[24:10] every corruption
[24:12] it will be overcome by the law of life
[24:24] you are made and born placed here in the
[24:26] body of christ as sons and daughters of
[24:28] god
[24:29] you don't have to knock down to the
[24:31] devil or knuckle down to the devil
[24:33] we've got a law that's the law of the
[24:35] holy spirit
[24:36] the only thing you know have to do is
[24:38] know how to let go
[24:40] and let god you keep fighting at it see
[24:43] and it won't never work
[24:44] when you let go and let god that's all
[24:50] simple principle right let go and let
[24:54] god
[24:55] and yet what do we struggle with every
[24:58] day
[25:01] that's what we struggle with every
[25:04] single
[25:05] day well brother i've got this trial and
[25:07] i've got that trial and i've got this
[25:08] situation i've got that situation
[25:10] the only challenge was talking with
[25:12] several brothers who was very encouraged
[25:13] the last couple of days
[25:14] we're talking about this very thing
[25:18] the thing we're struggling with is not
[25:19] the trial
[25:22] see when you have faith in god when you
[25:24] know what the outcome is going to be
[25:28] people will look at you and say oh
[25:29] you're just blind you have blind
[25:31] faith i don't have blind faith the faith
[25:34] has given me eyes to see
[25:36] not only the situation but what is
[25:38] beyond the situation
[25:41] i know what the outcome is and if i know
[25:43] what the outcome is
[25:44] it will direct what i'm doing right now
[25:49] i know where i'm headed i know what's
[25:51] going to come next
[25:52] and i'm not shaken today because i know
[25:54] what the outcome is
[25:56] i know what the outcome is and i'm
[25:58] trusting god to get me from here
[26:00] to there
[26:04] it's a simple thing but we struggle with
[26:07] it every day
[26:09] and you know i pray that no one has a a
[26:12] religious spirit say well brother you
[26:13] know i have arrived
[26:15] we have not all arrived we are arriving
[26:18] we're in the season of arriving we're
[26:20] getting to that place
[26:21] god is calling us we're in a season of
[26:24] finishing
[26:27] but not all is done yet oh god has
[26:30] spoken it and it's moving
[26:31] you know when the creator spoke he spoke
[26:34] things into existence and the molecules
[26:36] began to move
[26:38] or maybe we didn't see it maybe we don't
[26:41] see what god is doing but it's happening
[26:45] god is doing it brother branham gave us
[26:47] the example of john when he got
[26:48] discouraged and he's in prison
[26:52] john's in prison he's been preaching and
[26:54] they were god had given him victory and
[26:56] he was able to face the pharisees and
[26:58] and preach his message that god was at
[27:00] hand
[27:01] that the son of god was at hand
[27:05] now john's in prison brother branham
[27:08] says his
[27:09] prophetic eye got filmed over
[27:13] so john sent some of his disciples to
[27:15] talk to jesus and they come to jesus and
[27:16] they say
[27:18] john wants to know are you he
[27:23] jesus didn't say here's a pamphlet
[27:28] jesus didn't say you know go study
[27:31] the old testament for a couple years and
[27:33] come back and talk to me
[27:35] he said come see we've got a church
[27:37] service tonight come see
[27:41] come see today what's relevant
[27:45] what's present what's alive today
[27:48] and it will provide the evidence that
[27:50] you're looking for
[27:54] john got a little discouraged as brother
[27:57] branham said
[28:00] he got discouraged thinking that the
[28:01] word was not working
[28:03] but the word was working
[28:06] now let's go on
[28:11] oh if we could just think of it about
[28:13] that for a minute forces it
[28:16] regardless of conditions brother random
[28:20] is talking about the resurrection he's
[28:21] talking about life
[28:22] he says the the the devil the evil the
[28:25] darkness is trying to push against it
[28:28] but the law of life is not asking
[28:30] permission
[28:33] again we continue to emphasize this
[28:37] because the absoluteness of god's
[28:39] victory
[28:42] the absoluteness of god's victory
[28:45] must be something so personal and simple
[28:49] it just is what does one plus one
[28:53] equal whatever god wants it to equal
[28:59] you know when peter looked at the water
[29:01] he looked at the water and
[29:03] peter didn't say you know
[29:07] i know hydrodynamics and it is not
[29:09] physically possible to walk in the water
[29:11] but maybe
[29:12] in this case the salinity is extremely
[29:13] high
[29:15] and maybe the water is just extra
[29:17] shallow here
[29:20] when they saw jesus they were surprised
[29:22] they thought he was a ghost it wasn't
[29:23] normal
[29:24] there was something abnormal about the
[29:26] situation and
[29:27] in that abnormal situation peter stepped
[29:30] out
[29:32] he began to walk and we know what
[29:34] happens next but we want to focus on
[29:36] that moment when peter looks at a
[29:38] situation that
[29:39] should not be rational
[29:42] and he steps out anyway
[29:45] oh if we could just think of it for a
[29:46] minute forces it regardless
[29:49] of conditions we're not looking at
[29:52] conditions for evidence
[29:54] the only evidence we have that we need
[29:57] is god's word
[30:00] let's go to first samuel 16. now we've
[30:03] laid a bit of a foundation
[30:05] but god's grace allow us to now focus in
[30:08] on
[30:09] our thoughts for today
[30:17] praise the lord jesus
[30:31] now we've laid that bit of foundation
[30:34] because that's very important a little
[30:35] bit later
[30:36] on here as we get down to bringing
[30:39] things together
[30:41] but we want to establish those pieces so
[30:43] that god will
[30:45] anoint them and bring them together
[30:49] first samuel 16
[30:52] now let's read verses 16 to 23.
[30:59] let our lord now command thy servants
[31:01] which are before thee to seek out a man
[31:03] who is a cunning player on the harp
[31:06] and it shall come to pass when the evil
[31:08] spirit from god is upon thee that it
[31:09] shall play with his hand and thou shalt
[31:11] be
[31:11] well and saul said unto the servants
[31:15] provide me now a man that can play well
[31:17] and bring him to me
[31:19] sounds like a good idea then answered
[31:22] one of the servants that said behold
[31:24] i have seen the son of jesse the
[31:26] bethlehemite
[31:28] that is cunning and playing and mighty
[31:30] of a mighty valiant man
[31:33] and a man of war prudent in matters and
[31:36] a calmly person
[31:38] and the lord is with him wherefore saul
[31:41] sent messengers unto jesse and said send
[31:43] me david thy son which is with the sheep
[31:45] and jesse
[31:46] took an ass laden with bread and bottle
[31:49] of wine and a kid and sent them with
[31:50] david his son
[31:52] unto saul and david came to saul and
[31:55] stood before him and loved him greatly
[31:57] and
[31:57] he became his armor-bearer
[32:01] and saul sent to jesse saying let david
[32:04] i pray thee stand before me for he hath
[32:06] found favor
[32:07] in my sight and it came to pass when the
[32:09] evil spirit from god was upon saul that
[32:12] david took a harp and played with his
[32:14] hand
[32:15] so saul was refreshed and was well
[32:20] and the evil spirit departed from him
[32:30] this is from 1955 the great warrior
[32:32] david
[32:33] shame on you people that don't believe
[32:35] in string music
[32:36] no wonder evil spirits never like it
[32:40] they have to get away david cast out
[32:43] devils by playing on his string
[32:45] instrument that's what the scripture
[32:47] says that's right
[32:49] and when david would begin to play the
[32:51] evil spirit would leave saul
[32:53] is that right
[33:04] now we see that david played for the
[33:08] lord
[33:10] how do we know he played for the lord
[33:12] because the devil didn't like it
[33:16] the evil spirits didn't like what david
[33:18] was doing
[33:20] he would begin to play and the evil
[33:22] spirits got uncomfortable and they left
[33:27] so now we want to take for a little
[33:28] picture today
[33:31] we've looked at a restoration there's a
[33:33] law of restoration that god is doing
[33:35] something in the day that we're living
[33:36] in
[33:37] we many of us may be very familiar with
[33:39] that and
[33:40] and comfortable with that is something
[33:41] that's very precious in our hearts but
[33:43] again we just want to reiterate and lay
[33:45] that foundation
[33:46] for what we're going to look at now
[33:49] david had confidence
[33:50] in this he'd had experience he knew the
[33:52] lion and the bear he had these
[33:54] experiences
[33:55] and now he's before saul and he begins
[33:56] to play and there's a sweetness that
[33:58] comes
[33:58] and it drives the evil spirit away
[34:01] now we want to take for a subject or
[34:03] look at this picture today
[34:05] that the the day and the age that we're
[34:08] living in
[34:10] we know that the devil has done all
[34:11] these things in the world but we're
[34:12] going to set the devil aside for a
[34:14] little bit
[34:15] and now focus on what god's intent is
[34:17] for us
[34:20] you see when god's design when god's
[34:23] order
[34:24] is set in motion the devil doesn't have
[34:28] a choice
[34:30] the only thing we have to do is be
[34:32] ordered before god that's all we have to
[34:33] do
[34:34] as god intended now when we think order
[34:37] we think
[34:38] law we think rules that's not what we're
[34:40] referring to
[34:41] we're talking about the whole order of
[34:43] god all of it
[34:46] it's more than rules it's more than just
[34:48] pla uh
[34:49] doing everything in a precise way and
[34:51] say look at me i'm
[34:52] i'm a i'm a real christian it's about
[34:56] all of it the living word of god
[34:59] in your life in my life every day
[35:03] not twice a twice a week religion as we
[35:05] mentioned earlier
[35:09] but where are god's instruments today
[35:12] you see to be a a musician
[35:17] what happens in your fingers what you're
[35:19] playing
[35:20] what comes in your mouth if you're
[35:22] singing
[35:23] is what's in your heart what's in your
[35:27] heart
[35:28] comes out out of the abundance of the
[35:31] heart
[35:31] the mouth speaks so we're going to take
[35:35] a little bigger picture today
[35:37] instead of looking at an instrument in
[35:38] the way that we think we've got a piano
[35:40] we've got an organ
[35:41] we've got guitars instead of thinking of
[35:42] an instrument that way let's take a step
[35:44] back and look at god
[35:47] let's look at god and all of his glory
[35:50] what music does he like
[35:53] what is god looking for
[35:57] in this age in his people
[36:02] there's an instrument here there's
[36:04] instruments here
[36:05] there's instruments here there's
[36:06] instruments here there's instruments
[36:08] here
[36:11] god has created his children
[36:14] each one with a special place
[36:17] a special ability
[36:20] and if you see an orchestra do all of
[36:24] the instruments look the same
[36:26] no you got one that sings high and one
[36:30] that sings low
[36:32] ones on this side over here one's on
[36:34] this side over here
[36:36] you see the way that god intended is
[36:39] that
[36:40] each each of his children
[36:44] from the inside to the outside begins to
[36:47] resonate
[36:48] with something from the inside something
[36:51] that's on the inside begins to make that
[36:54] life put out something
[36:59] something is happening on the inside
[37:04] where are god's instruments
[37:08] what notes are to be played
[37:11] well praise the lord i am an instrument
[37:12] of god
[37:14] amen then i'm going to serve god in
[37:17] whatever way i choose no
[37:21] not what god intended you see god gave
[37:24] us
[37:25] sheet music and it's really detailed
[37:29] you know it's so detailed that you can't
[37:31] even play it by yourself
[37:34] you there is no way you can play every
[37:36] single note
[37:39] you need each of the instruments that
[37:42] god made
[37:44] all of them throughout all
[37:48] of god's creation throughout all
[37:52] of time when god set things
[37:55] in motion in the garden everything was
[37:58] in order
[38:00] god was had said everything as he had
[38:02] placed it to be
[38:03] and everything began to move together
[38:06] adam had his place when eve was
[38:08] expressed before the fall
[38:10] here is now eve she has her place you
[38:12] know the wonderful thing about
[38:14] music there is something called a melody
[38:16] and the melody line is the main line
[38:18] it's the line that we would normally be
[38:19] singing
[38:20] in a in a church service but if you just
[38:22] take a melody line and you just sing the
[38:24] melody line
[38:25] it doesn't have as much meaning
[38:28] as when you add harmony what is a
[38:31] harmony
[38:31] it's a note that is reflecting it's
[38:34] related to that melody
[38:37] but as you begin to add the other parts
[38:39] to the music
[38:41] the melody gets sweeter
[38:44] the meaning of the melody begins to come
[38:48] out
[38:50] and everything in the garden was right
[38:53] on cue
[38:55] before the fall everything was there
[38:57] everything was in perfect harmony
[38:58] the notes everything was in tune
[39:00] everything was in perfect time
[39:03] everything was moving as god had
[39:05] designed it
[39:07] now we know of course what comes next we
[39:10] know the fall that happens in the garden
[39:12] and time goes on and satan is now he
[39:14] believes that he's now destroyed
[39:16] the beauty the synchrony the the
[39:19] elegance of what god had designed
[39:24] satan thought that he had quieted
[39:28] god's music he thought that he had
[39:31] quieted
[39:33] the symphony of god's work
[39:37] you see these instruments of god have
[39:39] fallen
[39:40] they can no longer produce the music
[39:43] that they used to produce
[39:50] what a discouraging moment
[39:53] it seems so discouraging
[39:56] it seems so discouraging that at this
[39:58] time the beautif the beauty and the
[40:00] perfection of what god had designed
[40:03] is now not moving the way that god
[40:07] originally designed it
[40:11] but you know as we look at that it's
[40:12] easy to stay in that place
[40:14] it's easy to stay in a place of
[40:16] discouragement it's easy to look around
[40:18] at life and you look at those that have
[40:20] have maybe walked away from the lord
[40:22] they've given up
[40:25] and we get so discouraged and we get
[40:27] depressed and you'll find that your
[40:28] faith begins to weaken
[40:29] you find that your mind begins to be
[40:32] drawn down
[40:34] but remember the law of life
[40:41] we hit sometimes a moment in life where
[40:43] things are not flowing in harmony the
[40:45] way that we see that they should be
[40:48] but remember the law of life
[40:52] what god began as much as satan is
[40:55] trying to destroy
[40:58] god will bring all things
[41:02] back into order
[41:05] it's not accidental
[41:08] well maybe god was surprised
[41:12] no
[41:16] you see god had already written the
[41:17] sheet music
[41:20] god already knew the beginning he knew
[41:22] the middle part
[41:24] he knew every little change that was
[41:25] going to happen in between
[41:27] and he knew the end of it he knew the
[41:29] crescendo he knew the finale
[41:31] the crescendo is when things build to
[41:33] the end and the finale it is the finish
[41:37] god knew all of these things he's not
[41:39] surprised
[41:43] but he created his children to resonate
[41:47] to sing well well brother you know i'm
[41:49] not much of a singer but what about your
[41:51] life
[41:53] what about the things that you're doing
[41:54] every day well brother i'm you know i'm
[41:57] not a musician and i just have my little
[41:59] part
[41:59] but you know that every little part of
[42:01] the symphony is important
[42:04] it's adding meaning to the sound
[42:07] it's adding meaning to what is being
[42:10] expressed
[42:14] what if the drum says you know you know
[42:17] in an orchestra they got the big drum in
[42:18] the back that's
[42:19] beating the time as maybe you're
[42:21] marching or it's keeping everything in
[42:23] order and the drum is saying you know i
[42:24] want a solo
[42:26] boom boom boom boom boom boom
[42:31] but you're not made for that purpose
[42:34] you're made to keep time
[42:37] and then maybe the maybe the the cello
[42:39] says
[42:41] you know i really want to play the
[42:42] violins part
[42:46] i really love the violin
[42:49] i love how it just is so clear and it
[42:52] projects so beautifully and you know
[42:54] the violins always get the solo parts
[42:58] i'm a cello but i really want to be a
[43:00] violin
[43:02] but that cello was not made to reach
[43:05] into that octave
[43:07] it's not made to reach where the violin
[43:11] is playing
[43:13] but if the cello will realize the
[43:15] instrument will realize
[43:16] that the part it's playing is
[43:18] complimenting the violin
[43:21] that the instrument over here is
[43:23] complementing the instrument over here
[43:26] and that together it is now expressing
[43:29] the harmony of god as god intended
[43:34] you know so many times we want a solo
[43:37] part
[43:38] oh i want to stand out there and i want
[43:40] the lights to be on me
[43:43] and i want everyone to look at me and
[43:44] say that's a real christian
[43:49] come on it's his spirit floats around
[43:53] sometimes get on us
[43:54] we all know this
[43:58] you remember my brother ma'am said you
[43:59] can't stop the bird from flying over but
[44:01] you can stop them from making a nest
[44:04] it's not that we never have a thought
[44:06] sometimes we come to church and say
[44:08] well you know i'm just everything is in
[44:10] order
[44:11] and this is everything is perfect but
[44:13] you know at home you know i'm up here
[44:15] preaching today and yesterday our our 11
[44:17] month old was screaming the whole day
[44:20] he's 11 months old what am i what are we
[44:22] going to say to him
[44:24] i mean you kind of correct him as much
[44:26] as you can in 11 months but i can't
[44:28] sit down with my 11 month old and say
[44:29] now caleb now
[44:31] now you know all you need to do is talk
[44:34] because brother bannon gives us the
[44:35] example he said now
[44:36] you get real modern parents they're
[44:38] gonna they're gonna have their baby they
[44:39] say now
[44:40] we're modern parents and we've got it
[44:41] all figured out now baby
[44:43] now when you need something you just
[44:45] ring a bell
[44:48] oh come on and we listen to that and
[44:51] when
[44:52] and we get frustrated in ourselves
[44:53] sometimes as you know as fathers
[44:57] you know i think the beauty for me
[44:59] personally what is
[45:00] overwhelming to me the beauty is not
[45:04] that we all look perfect in what the
[45:06] world thinks is perfect
[45:09] the beauty is when god is bringing out
[45:12] of
[45:12] imperfection perfection
[45:15] it's beautiful because god is doing the
[45:17] work we can't get the glory for it
[45:21] and we're certainly not going to walk
[45:22] around like we never have a challenge or
[45:24] a trial
[45:24] but it's in the trial that god is
[45:26] glorified
[45:28] praise the lord
[45:33] what notes are to be played
[45:36] the sheet music is right here
[45:41] it's all written down it's already
[45:43] written
[45:45] do you know that you can't play if you
[45:47] want to be part of god's symphony you
[45:49] can't play notes that are not on these
[45:50] pages
[45:52] if you do you're cursed
[45:57] we can't friends if we're a child of god
[45:59] we can't sit down and say you know
[46:01] what do i feel like doing today
[46:05] you ever hear you ever hear someone be
[46:07] really out of order or not pay attention
[46:10] when they're playing an instrument
[46:12] someone following a asleep playing an
[46:13] instrument they don't realize that the
[46:14] whole world can hear what you're doing
[46:17] right well i you know i really want to
[46:20] play an instrument you know it takes a
[46:21] lot of work
[46:23] it takes a lot of dedication it takes a
[46:25] lot of sacrifice
[46:27] sometimes it's very painful i never
[46:30] thought about that
[46:32] i had a guitar one time that was the
[46:34] hardest thing to play it sounded good
[46:36] but boy it was hard to play
[46:38] i'd be halfway through a song service
[46:39] and my hand is just going numb and i'm
[46:42] just holding on and sweating
[46:45] we don't think about that sometimes it's
[46:48] hard to hold on
[46:52] but when i get past that and god bless
[46:54] me i came to service on a
[46:56] on a wednesday one day there was a
[46:59] beautiful brand new guitar sitting there
[47:01] for me
[47:03] somebody gave me a brand new beautiful
[47:06] taylor guitar
[47:09] you know what i really appreciate that
[47:11] guitar
[47:12] my hands don't hurt
[47:16] see we go through that time and god
[47:18] blesses us with another season
[47:20] and suddenly we don't have the strain
[47:22] that we had before
[47:24] and we can play clearer notes because of
[47:28] it
[47:30] our lives can play clearer notes because
[47:33] of where we've been
[47:38] the sheet music when and how
[47:41] is the music to be played
[47:45] oh this is a big question this is a very
[47:47] big question
[47:48] now in an orchestra there's one who
[47:52] orchestrates there is one who brings
[47:55] everybody together and makes sure that
[47:57] everyone's on the same page
[47:58] at the same time and they're doing the
[48:00] same thing at the same time
[48:02] now listen the conductor
[48:06] does not replace the sheet music
[48:13] the sheet music is still there
[48:16] now if we're i don't know if you've ever
[48:18] seen this before but in an orchestra
[48:20] you've got your sheet music see if i can
[48:22] balance this here
[48:25] i think it's gonna yeah okay
[48:28] we've got our sheet music and when
[48:31] you're playing an
[48:32] orchestra there's one that you're
[48:33] looking at the whole time
[48:36] and you look from that one to the sheet
[48:37] music look from that one to the sheet
[48:40] music
[48:40] look from that one to the sheet music
[48:42] and you know what happens
[48:44] when you get to know the sheet music so
[48:46] well
[48:49] you just keep looking at the conductor
[48:52] he's the one that's orchestrating
[48:53] he's the one that's at the time when he
[48:55] comes up then you come up and when he
[48:57] comes down then you come down
[48:59] and when he says to stop then you stop
[49:02] and if we have to move to the left we
[49:03] move to the left we move to the right we
[49:05] move to the right why
[49:06] because he's directing as it becomes
[49:09] personal
[49:09] as the sheep music becomes part of us
[49:12] we're watching the conductor yes lord
[49:15] yes lord what do you want me to do
[49:19] do you know that every conductor in the
[49:21] world
[49:22] is different in the natural sense
[49:26] in the natural sense when a conductor is
[49:29] conducting an orchestra
[49:31] the reason why some conductors are very
[49:34] high acclaimed and they're
[49:36] they're uh they're really sought after
[49:39] is because of the way they interpret
[49:42] the music you see not everyone
[49:47] can read the sheep music number one you
[49:50] have to have
[49:51] some ability to look at the sheet music
[49:53] and read it
[49:55] and second when you're some people have
[49:59] a gift
[50:00] when they read the sheet music they
[50:03] begin to
[50:04] feel the music and
[50:07] as they begin to feel the music it's
[50:09] what they feel
[50:11] that they're trying to express to the
[50:13] orchestra
[50:15] see they're reading from the pages
[50:18] they're getting something
[50:19] but to them it's alive it's a living
[50:21] thing
[50:22] they begin to hear the movements they're
[50:24] beginning to hear the the crescendo and
[50:26] the decrescendo as it goes up and it
[50:28] comes down
[50:30] it gets louder and it gets softer they
[50:32] begin to hear it they begin to feel the
[50:34] timing of it
[50:36] this note goes right here and this note
[50:40] goes right here hey a section over here
[50:43] i'm not pointing to anybody in the
[50:45] building this section over here let me
[50:47] point
[50:48] uh all the way over this section over
[50:50] here you're out of time
[50:53] let's stop stop stop let's practice that
[50:55] again
[51:00] you know and sometimes people are
[51:01] sitting in the orchestra
[51:03] i was in the orchestra as violin was my
[51:05] first instrument that i began to play
[51:06] and
[51:07] there were times when my bow did not
[51:08] touch the strings
[51:12] i was just going through the motions
[51:15] because it wasn't personal to me
[51:18] you know and you can you can fudge it
[51:20] you can make it look like you're
[51:22] playing a law you're playing at the same
[51:24] motion you're looking at the person next
[51:26] to you
[51:28] oh yeah yeah
[51:32] right in order oh i'm right in order but
[51:35] if you silence everything else and
[51:36] listen to what you're doing
[51:39] it's not an order
[51:43] and the conductor this conductor can
[51:45] hear every note
[51:49] he can hear everything and when one note
[51:52] is out
[51:54] you get the look you know what the look
[51:56] is you know
[52:02] you get the look you know we say of
[52:05] course we say that in humor but has
[52:06] anyone
[52:07] ever felt that from the lord you do
[52:10] something that was out of order you said
[52:11] oh brother branham said he did that once
[52:14] and he felt like he'd rob something from
[52:16] a baby
[52:17] you know that feeling oh something's not
[52:19] right
[52:20] there was a note that was out of order
[52:27] when and how is the music to be played
[52:31] see it's the conductor that's setting
[52:33] everything in order
[52:34] it's the the interpretation
[52:38] that the conductor sees when he's
[52:41] motioning he's bringing the orchestra
[52:43] together
[52:43] that everything plays together
[52:46] not all separate you see the season that
[52:50] we're in now
[52:51] it's not about you know us doing our
[52:53] little thing here and us doing a little
[52:54] thing here and us doing a little thing
[52:56] here
[52:58] one's praying one's fasting
[53:01] so that another one can go pray for the
[53:03] sick
[53:06] all things in order
[53:10] body ministering to the body
[53:13] well brother you know i want that solo
[53:16] part
[53:17] if you understand that every part
[53:21] is absolutely essential
[53:25] there is no greater there is no lesser
[53:28] there is no big eyes and little use
[53:30] there is none of that there is no
[53:32] respecter of persons
[53:34] if you are called to play some certain
[53:36] notes
[53:37] play those notes but get them right
[53:41] whatever the notes are my
[53:47] when sometimes we play with musicians we
[53:50] say this many many many times
[53:52] simplify simplify simplify
[53:56] music is one of the easiest things to
[53:57] see where pride comes out
[54:00] because pride will cause us to do all
[54:02] kinds of things that we probably
[54:03] shouldn't do
[54:04] and i'm not picking on musicians friends
[54:06] you might think this is all about music
[54:08] this isn't about music
[54:10] we're making this as a a parallel of
[54:13] course to what
[54:14] we are experiencing spiritually as i was
[54:17] praying about this i probably have
[54:19] i don't know five ten pages of notes
[54:21] things that brother branham was saying
[54:22] i'm looking at all these notes i said
[54:24] you know
[54:24] lord i know if we go through this as a
[54:27] bible study
[54:29] it's weary as we're trying to see the
[54:32] elegance of what god is doing
[54:34] because what god wants us to see is the
[54:36] whole picture
[54:38] no longer one part over here no longer
[54:41] one part over here
[54:42] but the whole tapestry the whole
[54:44] perfection
[54:45] of what god is presenting to us
[54:50] certainly not to disregard it there's i
[54:53] love doing
[54:53] uh uh teaching and preaching and going
[54:56] through ever
[54:57] for detail going through the message i
[54:58] want us to have a foundation i want to
[55:00] have a foundation
[55:01] i want to know what the prophet said i
[55:03] want to know what the scripture says
[55:04] and sometimes we get so so much that we
[55:07] we say well
[55:08] i don't i don't know where to look it's
[55:10] so good and it's so big
[55:13] and so by god's grace today the lord
[55:14] just give us a little picture
[55:17] that we can see how the pieces are
[55:20] supposed to fit
[55:21] together not separate
[55:26] how many churches how many true churches
[55:28] are there in the world just one
[55:31] just one we have fellowships we have
[55:34] assemblies
[55:35] but they're not the church of god the
[55:37] called out the true church of god
[55:38] is wherever the elector gathered it is
[55:42] wherever god has chosen to sound
[55:45] a note and you may not be able to hear
[55:49] all of the notes
[55:50] but in god's ears he's listening and
[55:51] says ah yes
[55:53] see my children are learning the
[55:55] sweetness
[55:57] of playing their parts my that's so
[56:00] wonderful
[56:03] now let's go to luke the first chapter
[56:08] look at that my bible stayed up there
[56:10] the whole time
[56:14] luke 1 and 17 raise the lord jesus
[56:41] luke 1 and 17 we'll just read the one
[56:43] verse here
[56:46] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[56:48] and power of elias that is to say elijah
[56:51] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[56:53] children of the disobedient to the
[56:54] wisdom of the just to make a
[56:56] make ready a people prepared for the
[56:58] lord
[57:00] now i want to we read this scripture
[57:01] again familiar verse
[57:04] well elijah's going to come and restore
[57:06] all
[57:09] that had been lost same as as was
[57:11] referring to in joel
[57:13] all that the worms had eaten it's all
[57:15] going to be restored
[57:17] and we can say with confidence from what
[57:20] the conductor has told us through the
[57:21] prophet here
[57:23] in the age that we live and we say well
[57:25] who is the conductor is it is it the
[57:26] prophet or is it god well it's god
[57:28] through the prophet
[57:29] that's the conductor god is conducting
[57:33] in the age and he's setting the time and
[57:35] the age and
[57:35] it's the prophet it's it's the the ear
[57:38] that god has and he speaks directly to
[57:40] the prophet and only the prophet can say
[57:42] see this scripture here see these notes
[57:43] here
[57:45] this today is that
[57:48] only the prophet can say that no one
[57:51] else has the right to say that
[57:53] this this scripture here is this day
[57:56] right now
[57:57] this day the scripture is fulfilled only
[57:59] the prophet can say that
[58:02] that's what his responsibility is
[58:07] god will restore we want to focus on
[58:09] this one element
[58:12] god will restore let's read this again
[58:15] just to make sure we
[58:17] focus on this correctly here
[58:20] he shall go before them in the spirit
[58:22] and power of elias to turn the hearts of
[58:24] the fathers to the children
[58:25] this is of course the pentecostal
[58:26] fathers there is a greater
[58:28] restoration this this restoration back
[58:31] to the book of acts this has already
[58:33] taken place
[58:34] and there's something greater even
[58:35] that's that's taking place restoration
[58:37] to eden as brother branham said all that
[58:38] atom loss has been restored
[58:41] a great restoration but as we look at
[58:44] this particular verse here
[58:46] what we're seeing is that there is a
[58:48] restoration there is a refocus that must
[58:51] take place
[58:54] so i ask you today what was lost
[58:58] something about the heart was lost
[59:02] because god said i will turn the hearts
[59:04] back too
[59:07] you see the heart was focused on
[59:09] something else
[59:11] but god had to restore the hearts back
[59:16] too
[59:21] pressure
[59:25] god had to restore the hearts back to
[59:28] anyone ever feel any pressure recently
[59:32] in the world well don't be too shy now
[59:42] so much pressure in the world
[59:45] and i want to put it to you like this
[59:46] today by god's grace
[59:50] you know i've tuned many a guitar and
[59:52] tuned
[59:53] violins and there's times when you're
[59:57] tuning up
[59:58] that instrument and it gets right
[59:59] getting close to being in tune
[1:00:01] you know what you experience you're
[1:00:03] plucking the string and it's getting
[1:00:04] close and you're going
[1:00:07] you're turning it up turn it up and you
[1:00:09] don't want it to break
[1:00:12] you know sometimes the pressure on us
[1:00:16] gets so much that we feel like we're
[1:00:19] going to break
[1:00:22] we feel like something in us
[1:00:26] is going to break
[1:00:29] we feel like at times the lord how is
[1:00:33] this fair
[1:00:35] lord how is it that this that life
[1:00:39] is so painful
[1:00:42] we feel like the pressure is getting
[1:00:44] tighter
[1:00:47] something in us is just getting wound
[1:00:49] tighter
[1:00:50] and tighter and tighter
[1:00:54] but you know if instrument sits there
[1:00:56] for a while
[1:01:00] it loses with the temperature changes
[1:01:02] and everything that's going on in the
[1:01:03] world that conditions in the world
[1:01:06] it begins to lose its pitch it gets out
[1:01:09] of tune
[1:01:11] and god permits pressure to come along
[1:01:15] god permits pressure yes more precious
[1:01:18] than gold
[1:01:20] because you might feel like things are
[1:01:22] tightening up inside of you lord
[1:01:24] i just don't know where this is going to
[1:01:25] go lord i don't know how this is going
[1:01:29] to turn out right and the lord
[1:01:32] is allowing you to be tightened and
[1:01:35] tighten some more
[1:01:37] and tighten some more because
[1:01:41] if the instrument is never tuned
[1:01:44] it can never play the correct notes
[1:01:48] and something is happening in the world
[1:01:50] that we're living in
[1:01:51] right now the world is feeling pressure
[1:01:55] and god's children are feeling pressure
[1:01:58] and there's a pressure down on the
[1:02:00] inside
[1:02:00] when we look around and we see
[1:02:02] corruption in the world oh
[1:02:04] lord jesus how long
[1:02:08] how long what must we see the corruption
[1:02:10] lord how
[1:02:11] far must this go and all the while god
[1:02:15] is
[1:02:16] tightening tightening
[1:02:19] tightening but when it gets
[1:02:22] just to the right amount of tension
[1:02:25] you pluck the string and it just begins
[1:02:29] to sing
[1:02:30] a sweet note
[1:02:33] not just one string all of the strings
[1:02:36] all of the attributes all of the the
[1:02:38] elements that are inside of us
[1:02:40] we get all out of sorts and we get this
[1:02:43] is loose and that's loose and our lives
[1:02:44] just kind of get
[1:02:46] uh what we're producing is not in tune
[1:02:51] but god says oh we need some pressure
[1:02:56] lord i don't want another trial but
[1:02:58] we're out of tune
[1:03:00] and god begins to tune us up and by
[1:03:03] god's grace as soon as we're in tune
[1:03:05] now something begins to play praise the
[1:03:08] lord i've never seen that before
[1:03:10] lord i've been praying about that for 10
[1:03:12] years 15 years and suddenly it's just
[1:03:14] done
[1:03:16] tightening and tightening and tightening
[1:03:21] what is god doing he's tuning up
[1:03:25] his church
[1:03:28] the prophet told us that it's pressure
[1:03:30] that we'll bring out of the church
[1:03:32] what needs to come out it's pressure
[1:03:37] does any of us like pressure no we don't
[1:03:39] like the pressure
[1:03:42] but when the strings begin to sing just
[1:03:44] right
[1:03:47] well lord i i've you know i appreciate
[1:03:49] this victory in my life but
[1:03:50] now where do i fit in all of it
[1:03:53] just serve the lord with all your heart
[1:03:55] your mind and soul
[1:03:56] amen and god will place you where you
[1:04:00] need to be
[1:04:01] in the orchestra remember
[1:04:05] the cello can't play the violin part
[1:04:09] the oboe can't play the trumpet part
[1:04:13] and sometimes you've got the wind
[1:04:14] section i think this is all the
[1:04:15] preachers us preachers sometimes
[1:04:18] we got a lot of wind and sometimes we
[1:04:21] talk a lot but we don't say enough
[1:04:24] sometimes brothers and uh brothers i
[1:04:27] won't say brothers and sisters but
[1:04:29] brothers
[1:04:32] brothers sometimes we need to pray and
[1:04:35] say less
[1:04:37] speak less and say more i should say
[1:04:40] because when we're doing our part we
[1:04:43] will
[1:04:43] see the effect the saints come closer
[1:04:47] together
[1:04:49] the harmony gets tighter do you know who
[1:04:52] has the best harmony
[1:04:54] maybe maybe you've never heard this or
[1:04:56] maybe not aware of it but you know the
[1:04:58] people that can sing together the best
[1:05:00] have the most beautiful harmony our
[1:05:03] families
[1:05:06] because they say all their words the
[1:05:07] same they have the same accent they have
[1:05:10] the same way of shaping their words
[1:05:11] and they sing together and it just comes
[1:05:13] together so beautifully
[1:05:15] but friends we're supposed to be a
[1:05:17] family
[1:05:19] the words that we speak here and speak
[1:05:21] and speak and speak
[1:05:22] we're supposed to be expressing them the
[1:05:23] same way so that when all is brought
[1:05:26] together in harmony
[1:05:28] it's perfect
[1:05:31] the sweetest sounds the sweetest things
[1:05:34] that god wants to express
[1:05:36] how do we get there oh there's all this
[1:05:39] pressure
[1:05:40] i'm feeling pressure i'm feeling
[1:05:41] pressure and it's incredible
[1:05:44] the amount of pressure that an
[1:05:46] instrument can take
[1:05:48] do you know why because the instrument
[1:05:50] that little violin
[1:05:52] as small as it may be it's designed
[1:05:55] to handle that pressure
[1:05:58] it's designed perfectly to handle the
[1:06:01] pressure
[1:06:01] and under pressure is when it makes its
[1:06:04] sweetest sound
[1:06:07] praise the lord jesus that's exactly
[1:06:10] what i want to be at
[1:06:11] i don't care what pressure it is friends
[1:06:13] i pray that from the bottom of your
[1:06:14] heart
[1:06:15] trust the one that made you trust the
[1:06:18] one
[1:06:18] that's tuning us up and it might feel
[1:06:20] like such a pressure
[1:06:22] that we're going to break but god made
[1:06:24] the vessel
[1:06:25] god made the instrument to play the
[1:06:27] sound
[1:06:29] and he's the one that's orchestrating he
[1:06:32] knows exactly
[1:06:33] what each part is supposed to be played
[1:06:37] praise the lord and you might feel like
[1:06:40] you're all alone but friends you're not
[1:06:41] alone
[1:06:42] just keep on serving god with your whole
[1:06:44] heart give him everything
[1:06:48] pressure
[1:06:52] we've already spoken about this a little
[1:06:54] bit to each a different part to play
[1:06:59] we can't do the same part as our
[1:07:03] brothers and brothers and sisters in
[1:07:05] africa or india
[1:07:06] or china we're playing in a different
[1:07:09] location
[1:07:10] god called us to be here so god let me
[1:07:13] serve if you call me to
[1:07:14] to live here in lima then let me live
[1:07:16] the life of of christ
[1:07:18] to the fullest extent in the age that
[1:07:20] i'm called to live in
[1:07:21] let me get the timing right let me get
[1:07:23] the notes right let me get everything in
[1:07:26] order
[1:07:28] the the world might
[1:07:31] hear that music that god is beginning to
[1:07:33] play
[1:07:35] and they look at that music and they say
[1:07:36] well that's not what i want
[1:07:39] where did that come from where did that
[1:07:42] music come from
[1:07:43] but when god is doing something there is
[1:07:47] in incredible situations where it seems
[1:07:50] like everything in the world is
[1:07:51] literally
[1:07:52] falling apart around us in the midst of
[1:07:55] it when god begins
[1:07:56] to move you will see when god steps in
[1:07:58] that
[1:07:59] everything begins to happen on a rhythm
[1:08:03] maybe you've never seen that before
[1:08:04] maybe maybe you just haven't seen it
[1:08:06] maybe your experience did not recognize
[1:08:08] it but when god begins to move
[1:08:10] everything happens in a perfect order in
[1:08:12] perfect time
[1:08:15] things that seem impossible this has to
[1:08:17] happen this has to happen
[1:08:19] how is it going to happen and god steps
[1:08:21] in and in perfect order
[1:08:22] it begins to unfold
[1:08:25] how do we do that how do we always play
[1:08:28] the part that we are called to play
[1:08:32] my
[1:08:36] missing the sheet music you know what we
[1:08:39] would call a person like this
[1:08:41] truly in spiritual terms missing the
[1:08:43] sheet music is a fanatic
[1:08:47] well brother or sister i follow the
[1:08:50] spirit of god
[1:08:52] well do you because what you're doing is
[1:08:55] not in sync with the conductor and it's
[1:08:57] not in sync with the sheet music
[1:08:59] but god told me nope no he didn't
[1:09:04] god won't contradict his own word and if
[1:09:06] it's contrary to his word god didn't say
[1:09:08] it
[1:09:11] wow that sounds a little too straight
[1:09:14] doesn't it
[1:09:16] that's the truth of it if it's not in
[1:09:18] the sheet music it's not god
[1:09:22] and if we can submit ourselves to the
[1:09:24] sheet music and we're not running around
[1:09:26] following emotion after this following
[1:09:28] this what we feel like
[1:09:29] is an inspiration after this but stay
[1:09:31] with the sheet music
[1:09:36] you know what the conductor brings when
[1:09:38] he's really getting expressive
[1:09:40] do you know what he is he is letting the
[1:09:42] orchestra know
[1:09:44] what dynamics to play
[1:09:48] at any certain time
[1:09:54] mechanics we got the we've got
[1:09:58] the sheet music we got it right yep yep
[1:10:00] i know the sheet music
[1:10:03] then we got the person that doesn't know
[1:10:04] the sheet music and they're wanting to
[1:10:05] do this they want to do that
[1:10:07] friend you may love the lord but if you
[1:10:08] really love the lord you're going to
[1:10:09] love his word
[1:10:11] every part of it every part beginning to
[1:10:13] end all the sheet music
[1:10:14] because every movement is expressing
[1:10:17] something more
[1:10:18] everything that god is expressing in the
[1:10:20] age that we're living in
[1:10:22] right now we're watching change after
[1:10:25] change
[1:10:25] after change and the beauty of the whole
[1:10:28] symphony
[1:10:29] is opening before us praise the lord
[1:10:33] there was never an age that gets to see
[1:10:35] what we are seeing today
[1:10:38] we are getting to witness the symphony
[1:10:40] from the beginning of time
[1:10:41] to the end of time the whole
[1:10:44] beauty of all that god has orchestrated
[1:10:50] it's overwhelming overwhelming
[1:10:54] some are missing the sheet music
[1:10:58] and some are ignoring the conductor
[1:11:03] well brother who are you talking about
[1:11:05] this is a general truth
[1:11:07] it's between you and god to sort out if
[1:11:09] you're on any end of the spectrum
[1:11:12] you must sort it out the bible says make
[1:11:13] your calling an election sure
[1:11:17] pastor can't do that for you preacher
[1:11:18] can't do that for you
[1:11:20] you must seek it out with god you must
[1:11:23] look at the conductor
[1:11:24] and say am i or am i not in tune with
[1:11:27] the conductor
[1:11:30] and if i'm not in tune with the
[1:11:31] conductor if i'm not on time
[1:11:33] what's wrong with me that's a time of
[1:11:36] reflection
[1:11:38] that's the time to really dig deep and
[1:11:40] say
[1:11:43] lord i thought i was i thought i was
[1:11:47] doing my part and here i am playing the
[1:11:50] entirely
[1:11:51] wrong instrument
[1:11:55] i'm playing in the wrong key
[1:11:58] i'm playing the wrong part at the wrong
[1:12:00] time i got the right part
[1:12:02] i got the right notes i got them reading
[1:12:05] the sheet music
[1:12:07] that's right that's right that's right
[1:12:09] but we're totally out of time
[1:12:13] it must be in time the notes must be
[1:12:15] right the time must be right the sheet
[1:12:17] music must be right and the conductor
[1:12:20] must be front and center
[1:12:24] who's the conductor the holy ghost
[1:12:27] well brother you said it's the holy
[1:12:28] ghost through the prophet he's exactly
[1:12:30] right
[1:12:30] but the prophet right now is in the
[1:12:32] ground he's resting
[1:12:34] he's resting for his time to come up to
[1:12:36] be raised in the resurrection
[1:12:39] what now you know after brother banner
[1:12:42] passed away there was much confusion
[1:12:43] what do we do what do we do
[1:12:46] let's ask ourselves the same question
[1:12:48] today not in that same sense
[1:12:50] but in the general sense lord what do we
[1:12:52] do now what is the season that we're in
[1:12:54] right now
[1:12:55] not not two years ago not five years ago
[1:12:57] not 10 years ago
[1:12:58] right now
[1:13:03] in 2021 what
[1:13:06] now am i playing the right part
[1:13:10] right now
[1:13:13] friend as as the prophet told us we get
[1:13:15] to a turn we get up to a turn
[1:13:17] and we're not building a wall we're
[1:13:18] building a building and we get up to
[1:13:20] that corner
[1:13:21] and here we are going off the end of it
[1:13:23] because bro
[1:13:24] god brought us up to a corner and we did
[1:13:27] not
[1:13:28] catch when the conductor said it's time
[1:13:30] to change
[1:13:32] the tempo changed
[1:13:36] the tempo is the time
[1:13:40] my ignoring the conductor
[1:13:49] there are times when god made us who we
[1:13:51] are to be
[1:13:54] we had a experience with god
[1:13:58] maybe god did a work in us and we've
[1:14:00] started on this journey
[1:14:03] we've come a long way
[1:14:06] saints i don't know how long you've
[1:14:07] walked with the lord but i sure
[1:14:09] appreciate your testimony
[1:14:12] being serious and diligent before the
[1:14:13] lord sincere before the lord and just
[1:14:15] committing yourself to him in the day
[1:14:17] and age that we live in
[1:14:18] you know that being here in this
[1:14:20] building today is a victory
[1:14:22] the bible says that you see that day
[1:14:24] approaching gather together even the
[1:14:25] more
[1:14:26] and here we are scripture has been
[1:14:28] fulfilled
[1:14:29] scripture is being fulfilled the note is
[1:14:32] being played
[1:14:35] our lives are resonating
[1:14:41] but there are times when
[1:14:44] things happen in life the lord permits
[1:14:46] it
[1:14:49] maybe maybe we were getting tightened up
[1:14:52] we were under pressure
[1:14:54] we were getting tightened up you know
[1:14:57] the bible says he'll never put more on
[1:14:59] you than you can bear
[1:15:02] but there are times when we get to the
[1:15:03] point where we break a string
[1:15:08] it makes a terrible sound
[1:15:12] oh it's a terrible sound it broke a
[1:15:14] string who did that
[1:15:17] wasn't god god said he wouldn't put more
[1:15:21] on
[1:15:21] us than we could bear so how did
[1:15:24] something break
[1:15:26] inside of us
[1:15:29] who did that we did that
[1:15:35] we did that brother the devil did that
[1:15:38] no
[1:15:38] the devil can't do anything unless you
[1:15:42] permit him
[1:15:44] remember he has no authority over you
[1:15:48] the devil cannot force you to do
[1:15:50] anything the bible says we are
[1:15:52] tempted and led astray of our own lust
[1:15:56] sometimes something does break in us
[1:16:00] you know it's a terrible sound and if
[1:16:02] you put a violin up to your face
[1:16:04] and tighten it down and it breaks it
[1:16:05] could put your eye out
[1:16:07] it could be dangerous bad things can
[1:16:10] happen
[1:16:11] and now that instrument cannot play the
[1:16:14] notes
[1:16:15] it was designed to play
[1:16:19] and sometimes we we go through a
[1:16:21] situation like that
[1:16:24] i see where brother i you know i've been
[1:16:25] through a situation and to hurt me
[1:16:28] and i have such compassion for that
[1:16:34] we look at god we look at the kindness
[1:16:36] of god
[1:16:37] we look at what god is calling us to be
[1:16:41] we're looking at the beauty of his
[1:16:43] symphony
[1:16:45] if we can just catch a glimpse of that
[1:16:48] do we think
[1:16:49] that a god like that wants us to go
[1:16:53] on with a broken string
[1:16:56] god does not desire that and there are
[1:17:00] times when we were playing our part
[1:17:03] and maybe the devil put such pressure on
[1:17:05] us and we gave in to whatever the
[1:17:07] situation might have been and it broke a
[1:17:09] string
[1:17:10] and now here we are we're so hurt on the
[1:17:13] inside
[1:17:13] that we're so afraid that god will begin
[1:17:16] to pluck the strings
[1:17:20] we're afraid god i love you
[1:17:24] i'm reading the sheet music
[1:17:30] i'm reading the sheet music i'm watching
[1:17:33] the conductor
[1:17:37] but i just can't allow that lord with
[1:17:39] something in my heart it hurts too much
[1:17:43] i can't allow you to make my heart sing
[1:17:45] the way it used to
[1:17:48] i can't allow you to have absolutely
[1:17:51] free control in my heart
[1:17:54] because something hurts too much about a
[1:17:57] string broken
[1:17:58] i've have things that hurt in my heart
[1:18:02] and that harp is sitting in a corner
[1:18:05] oh i love the lord i'm reading the sheet
[1:18:07] music
[1:18:10] i'm reading the sheet music and i'm
[1:18:11] watching the conductor
[1:18:14] but lord i just can't make the sound i
[1:18:16] can't something's just not free in my
[1:18:18] heart the way it used to be
[1:18:21] something's bound up in me and lord i
[1:18:23] don't know how to be free
[1:18:27] and the instrument that god had designed
[1:18:30] is sitting there in a corner maybe
[1:18:33] coming to church
[1:18:34] service after service
[1:18:42] but friend if we can see today
[1:18:47] that the one that began the work gave us
[1:18:51] a law of life
[1:18:54] that that which all that the devil has
[1:18:56] tried to destroy and her
[1:18:57] in maine god gave us a law of life
[1:19:01] i have restored saith the lord
[1:19:05] all that was lost all that the devil is
[1:19:07] trying to sow
[1:19:08] all that the devil has tried to do i
[1:19:11] have overcome it
[1:19:28] you could say to me brother i hear you
[1:19:32] but brother it's been so long been so
[1:19:36] long since i felt the move of god in my
[1:19:37] heart
[1:19:39] i don't know what to do
[1:19:42] where do i start
[1:19:46] what do i do to allow god
[1:19:49] to tune me up and pluck my heartstrings
[1:19:53] again
[1:19:55] what can i do all things would be in
[1:19:59] such perfect order
[1:20:01] and tune that i would play my part
[1:20:05] exactly how god intended
[1:20:09] this is between you and god where do i
[1:20:16] start
[1:20:18] we already read this but now let's read
[1:20:21] it again
[1:20:23] you are made and born and placed here in
[1:20:26] the body of christ
[1:20:27] as sons and daughters of god you don't
[1:20:29] have to knock down to the devil
[1:20:31] we've got a law the law that's the law
[1:20:35] of the holy spirit
[1:20:36] the only thing you know have to do is to
[1:20:38] know how to let go
[1:20:40] and let god you keep fighting at it see
[1:20:44] it won't never work when you let go
[1:20:47] and let god that's all
[1:20:52] we've already read it
[1:20:55] you know what's amazing about a smaller
[1:20:58] instrument take
[1:21:00] a guitar for example and you put that
[1:21:03] guitar
[1:21:05] next to let's say a piano a grand piano
[1:21:10] do you know what happens to that guitar
[1:21:12] you can just hold it there just like
[1:21:13] this you can hold a guitar there
[1:21:15] in front of the piano do you know what
[1:21:17] that that guitar will begin to do
[1:21:20] when the piano is played the guitar will
[1:21:22] begin to resonate
[1:21:25] with the notes of the piano
[1:21:29] and you may say brother i don't know how
[1:21:32] to get from here to there
[1:21:36] but friend if you will spend time
[1:21:40] in the presence of the lord and allow
[1:21:43] your heart to open
[1:21:45] just spend time in his presence you
[1:21:48] don't need to explain it to god
[1:21:51] god already knows remember
[1:21:55] he made the instrument he made you
[1:21:59] who you are and made you for your
[1:22:01] purpose
[1:22:03] and when we spent time in the presence
[1:22:05] of the lord
[1:22:07] and he begins to sound those wonderful
[1:22:10] notes
[1:22:11] the word is being preached the notes
[1:22:13] begin to drop into our hearts and it
[1:22:14] begins to resonate
[1:22:16] let go and let god
[1:22:21] friends when we do that god begins to
[1:22:24] set things right that we didn't even
[1:22:25] know we're wrong
[1:22:28] we begin to resonate right in tune right
[1:22:32] along with what god
[1:22:33] is doing
[1:22:37] all things decently
[1:22:40] and in order many times we feel like
[1:22:44] that's such a
[1:22:45] a bondage i'm not saying that that
[1:22:48] again i don't know where anybody's heart
[1:22:49] is at but i know the perception i can
[1:22:51] feel the perception sometimes
[1:22:53] when i've spoken with people but people
[1:22:55] hear that and they think oh
[1:22:57] church order it's just a bondage
[1:23:00] it's not none of god's word
[1:23:04] to his children is bondage
[1:23:08] the pressure that we feel is not bondage
[1:23:12] god is tuning us up to set us in our
[1:23:15] place
[1:23:17] so that we can sing we can resonate we
[1:23:19] can be
[1:23:20] exactly what god designed and intended
[1:23:23] us to be
[1:23:27] but it requires
[1:23:32] the sheep music it requires
[1:23:37] our attention to be on the conductor
[1:23:42] and it requires god to play
[1:23:46] our lives in whatever way
[1:23:50] he desires because then this
[1:23:53] instrument begins to play and this
[1:23:56] instrument begins to play in this
[1:23:58] instrument in this instrument
[1:23:59] and we all by god's grace begin to play
[1:24:02] our little parts
[1:24:04] and the sweetest music begins to come
[1:24:07] out
[1:24:09] now what happened
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:13] when david played before the lord
[1:24:20] there was an evil spirit and what
[1:24:22] happened
[1:24:23] when david played before the lord
[1:24:27] the evil spirit had to leave
[1:24:31] and we want to by god's grace expand
[1:24:33] this just a little bit
[1:24:35] because we think of an evil spirit a lot
[1:24:38] of times we
[1:24:38] we think that the spirit is right there
[1:24:40] and and you know a lot of times that's
[1:24:42] not true
[1:24:42] a lot of times the spirit has had an
[1:24:44] effect that an evil spirit has done
[1:24:46] damage
[1:24:47] and the damage is there and the spirit's
[1:24:49] not even there anymore
[1:24:51] and a lot of times we think that we're
[1:24:52] we're wrestling with the devil and we're
[1:24:54] not there's times maybe we are and we
[1:24:55] don't realize that
[1:24:56] but there are times when the devil is
[1:24:59] there the devil can't get into where you
[1:25:01] are
[1:25:03] maybe something happened and we're
[1:25:05] feeling the effect of something that the
[1:25:07] devil did
[1:25:07] we're feeling the effect of it but the
[1:25:09] devil's not there we're just carrying a
[1:25:11] scar
[1:25:13] we're carrying something that is causing
[1:25:15] us to shy away from the presence of god
[1:25:21] but if i can encourage you in anything
[1:25:24] today friends
[1:25:26] let go and let god and let god begin to
[1:25:29] pluck the heartstrings
[1:25:31] of your heart and when god does that
[1:25:34] when god is the one that's doing that
[1:25:37] and we're reading the
[1:25:38] sheet music we're watching the conductor
[1:25:40] and the music begins to play from our
[1:25:42] heart
[1:25:42] it might feel painful but even the
[1:25:46] effects
[1:25:47] of everything that the devil has done
[1:25:49] even the effect of it
[1:25:52] will begin to fade
[1:25:56] even the effect and the devil would love
[1:25:59] you to think that you can never be free
[1:26:01] of anything you can never be free
[1:26:04] well you just have to live with that for
[1:26:06] the rest of your life don't accept it
[1:26:08] if it's not absolute freedom it's not of
[1:26:11] god
[1:26:16] sometimes we settle we settle that we're
[1:26:20] only going to play one note
[1:26:24] we settle for you know maybe this is all
[1:26:27] that i can do
[1:26:29] let go and let god serve god with all
[1:26:31] your heart your mind and soul and
[1:26:32] whatever
[1:26:33] ever god has called you to do serve him
[1:26:35] give him your whole heart but
[1:26:36] continue to open your heart more and
[1:26:38] more and more and god will continue
[1:26:41] to play there are times as a musician
[1:26:43] you begin to play and you begin to play
[1:26:45] and you play for years
[1:26:46] and you say well you know i played this
[1:26:47] before i've had this practice before and
[1:26:50] all i do i just do these notes and i do
[1:26:52] these chord changes and i do this
[1:26:54] and i do this and i do this you know
[1:26:55] that's just all that i can do but you
[1:26:57] know sometimes friend
[1:26:58] if you just let go and begin to pray and
[1:27:01] you begin to allow yourself to be
[1:27:03] submitted to god
[1:27:05] you'll be surprised what comes out of
[1:27:07] your life
[1:27:08] as a musician if you do that and you
[1:27:10] just begin to pray and you begin to play
[1:27:12] you'll play notes as you've never played
[1:27:13] before
[1:27:14] god is the inspiration god is the one
[1:27:17] that we're looking to
[1:27:18] and as he begins to move in freedom in
[1:27:20] us
[1:27:24] every surface anything can happen
[1:27:28] anything can happen we set our
[1:27:31] expectations on what we've experienced
[1:27:34] but friends god is calling us to be in
[1:27:36] places that we've not
[1:27:38] yet experienced amen
[1:27:41] have we been translated from this world
[1:27:42] to another
[1:27:44] well by faith we know it oh we're living
[1:27:46] it we're we're watching it
[1:27:48] we're seeing it by faith we're caught up
[1:27:50] in heavenly places
[1:27:51] but the moment's going to come when this
[1:27:53] body is going to do something that's
[1:27:54] never done before
[1:27:57] how are we going to know that we know
[1:28:00] that we know
[1:28:00] that we're so settled
[1:28:04] oh you mean you mean we just play the
[1:28:07] next note
[1:28:09] yeah just play the next note oh the next
[1:28:12] note is step from here to there
[1:28:14] oh praise the lord you mean to tell me
[1:28:17] it's all over
[1:28:19] everything i i expected it to be this
[1:28:23] you know more of a pressure more of a
[1:28:25] push more of a push but i was just
[1:28:27] watching the conductor and i started to
[1:28:28] forget about the world and suddenly the
[1:28:30] conductor said
[1:28:31] play the next note and we play the next
[1:28:33] note
[1:28:36] oh
[1:28:39] that was it that was the final note
[1:28:43] that's all we need to do
[1:28:46] we make it complicated it's not
[1:28:51] print i encourage you if you're
[1:28:54] you've been a silent harp then just let
[1:28:57] god
[1:28:58] begin to work get in the presence of god
[1:29:01] and just spend time
[1:29:02] and allow god to begin to move in your
[1:29:03] heart again and begin to pluck those
[1:29:05] heartstrings
[1:29:06] the joy of your salvation the joy of the
[1:29:08] lord the pleasure
[1:29:10] of being a christian the pleasure of
[1:29:12] being in this world
[1:29:14] right now in the season that we're
[1:29:15] living in well that just seems contrary
[1:29:18] but we're listening to the music we're
[1:29:21] hearing the sympathy
[1:29:22] begin to play in its fullness and it's
[1:29:24] building
[1:29:25] building to the final moments
[1:29:31] what a joy let's all stand
[1:29:39] ask the musicians to come
[1:29:44] friends i pray that there's something
[1:29:46] that
[1:29:48] just settles in your heart the
[1:29:51] simplicity of it
[1:29:53] i know if we talk about musical terms
[1:29:55] that sometimes i can be confusing
[1:29:57] and i certainly don't mean for that to
[1:29:58] be
[1:30:00] but i pray that by god's grace a simple
[1:30:02] little picture
[1:30:04] of each instrument in their place
[1:30:08] each instrument beginning to resonate as
[1:30:11] it's supposed to
[1:30:12] the pressure getting cranked oh lord
[1:30:15] it's difficult it's difficult oh
[1:30:18] something just happened everything's in
[1:30:21] tune
[1:30:22] everything's on time maybe we had a
[1:30:26] little pluck here and a little pluck
[1:30:27] there
[1:30:27] you know i'm a cello and i want to be a
[1:30:29] violin but you know what god made me a
[1:30:31] cello
[1:30:32] praise the lord i'm just going to be a
[1:30:34] cello
[1:30:35] oh i i happen to love the show i love
[1:30:37] the violin and i love when everything
[1:30:40] comes together
[1:30:41] and you hear the beauty
[1:30:45] the beauty of god's intent
[1:30:53] you know
[1:30:56] when you hear when you hear a
[1:31:02] song let's say nearer my god to thee
[1:31:07] you hear a song like that and you hear
[1:31:09] someone sing it and
[1:31:10] you're thinking about the person that
[1:31:11] may be standing there in front of you
[1:31:13] maybe giving a song special or something
[1:31:14] to that effect
[1:31:15] and they're singing a song and you you
[1:31:17] feel wow praise the lord
[1:31:18] that really blessed me that maybe the
[1:31:20] spirit moved upon it and just
[1:31:21] just the moment it was the right thing
[1:31:23] for the right moment
[1:31:26] we hear that and we we think sometimes
[1:31:30] wow the song
[1:31:34] in that moment but we lose sight of the
[1:31:38] fact
[1:31:40] sometimes that the inspiration
[1:31:44] for the writing of the music came before
[1:31:48] and what we are singing is already
[1:31:51] written
[1:31:53] what we're singing what we're playing is
[1:31:56] already written
[1:31:59] it's written in the score
[1:32:03] it's written in the sheet music it's
[1:32:05] written
[1:32:06] already in god's order and as we begin
[1:32:08] to play it
[1:32:10] something about it is familiar
[1:32:13] when it's all at peace all things are in
[1:32:15] order all things
[1:32:17] are together let's sing
[1:32:20] this little song in moments like these
