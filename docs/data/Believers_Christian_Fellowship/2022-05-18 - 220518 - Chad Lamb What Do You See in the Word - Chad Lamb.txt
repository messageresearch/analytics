preaching you would save souls god we're here to receive from you that portion we have need of god we're looking to you to provide and we just pray lord that you would be exalted in all that would be said and done now you would take the preeminence lord and that you would take these lips of clay and preach your eternal words of life we love you we commit ourselves to you know we pray that you would help us to receive all that you have for us in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn into proverbs chapter 27. we want to welcome brother abraham myra he got in last night i went picked him up in dayton and we got back to the house yesterday or last night and so he was very tired after a long long journey he traveled for two days to come and see us and so you don't know what a sacrifice it is for me to be up here and allow that brother to sit back there because i would love to be hearing and minister the word so i'm trying to be good and have brotherly kindness amen but god bless you brother abraham it's good to have you amen and before we read the scripture i just want to say how much i enjoyed the kids service on sunday and i'm thankful for all who helped with that i really appreciate brother greg and sister megan for really organizing and planning all the uh the snack and the activities and it went really well i know they had sister jenny and sister justine weingarten helping them brian and anna and blake and emily so thank you all for pitching in and helping and a special thank you for john small and the small family for their ice cream i mean i told that brother he knows how to get invited to every party you just get a big ice cream maker and so i'm trying to find a kettle corn maker or something so we can compete amen god bless you we really appreciate that and we're so thankful we had a wonderful time i enjoyed myself and it was good so we're hoping we can do it again soon i also want to remind you of the services this weekend starting friday friday saturday and sunday we probably will probably see a few visitors so keep your eye out and make sure you make them welcome and greet them and maybe have some time of fellowship so we'll have a few things going on saturday saturday morning we have the men's fellowship breakfast at the fishers home i also have a youth fellowship at the gym and then after the evening service there'll be a donut and coffee fellowship over in the fellowship hall so we'll have some time to spend together if we have visitors we can greet them make them welcome and and spend some time talking with one another so i'm excited about the weekend amen i come looking forward to hearing the word to receive my portion amen i hope you get yours too but i'm determined to get mine because i just i need the lord and i'm looking for him to speak amen while we're standing let's look at proverbs chapter 27 and verse 19. let's read one one scripture here 27-19 as in water face answered the face so the heart of man to man man god bless you so seated we ask the lord to bless us as we look into his word and i want to just focus on the first part of that scripture and i'd like to read this quote out of identification the prophet says and that's what we want to look at tonight i want to look at me and i want you to look at yourself and as we look into god's great mirror of his word let's be able to identify ourselves with some that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times and i want to see myself in god's looking glass amen and so brother branham's telling us the bible is god's great mirror god's looking glass and we should be looking into that to see ourselves and some character something that's happened we can look and see ourselves so i titled this this evening what do you see in the word so it's a very personal question what do you see in the word and we're going to talk about that for a little bit of time delay a little bit of background let's go to exodus chapter 34. i'm going to lay this scripture in so i can move in to another scripture exodus 34. so what do you see when you look into the word we're going to find out that's a critical question it it really the when we look in when we look into this as we go further it's going to become very obvious obvious how critical that is what do you see when what what do you see in the word when you look into the word what do you see because what you see has everything to do with how you're going to live and who you are and so let's look at exodus 34 verse 33. this is in the exodus journey we're going to read about moses and it says until moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the veil off until he had come out and he come out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him we know this portion of scripture brother rem speaks about this moses when he would bring the word of god had to put a veil over his face because the glory that was on his face was too much for the children of israel to behold they couldn't look to it and we're going to get to that scripture that paul refers to that in just a moment amen and and so it was countenance was so bright that they could not behold him so he had to veil his face so that he could speak to them the word of god and in the message the unveiling of god brother brahm says and today the veil of tradition hides the word again saying it's not so but it is so god is testifying of it blasting himself right out as bright as the sun before everyone and they fail to see it god be merciful to us in type moses coming from the presence of god with the word of god for that age now watch we're now in exodus 19 don't miss this now exodus 19 moses is coming from the presence of god or 20 21 19 20 and 21 moses is coming from the presence of god he has been into the word the word has been wrote and he in the presence of god with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age and moses come forth his face shine so see the word was in him ready to be manifest give out to the people the true word god had wrote it and it was with moses notice it was with moses and moses was ready to be manifested he was the word to them moses he was the word to them he was the living word hid amen he was the living word head veiled himself moses had to put a veil over his own face why he was the word so why did moses have to put a veil over face because he was the word amen and in this station they could not handle the word of god they had to turn from that that's why his face shone with the glory of the lord because the word is light amen and the light was so bright coming from moses they couldn't handle it and he had to put a veil over his face moses put available versus why he was the word to them he was the living word hid oh i love that amen until the word was i'm sorry he was that word amen until that word was made known moses had to veil himself amen do you see it wherever the word is it's veiled moses had the word now remember after the word was made manifest moses was moses again see but while the word was in him to be give out he was god i'm going to read that again so that we don't miss it but while that word was in him to be give out he was god god is the word and moses had the word and when he was brought with the word to give out while the word was in him he was god well he wasn't moses no more he had the word of the lord for that age nothing could touch him until that was over he had that word with him so therefore when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand they couldn't comprehend what's going on they couldn't receive the word and it's purity coming straight from the mouth of god amen and god had thundered and spoke to them on the mountain and they couldn't handle the voice of god so they asked moses to go to god and get the word and come back when moses went and got the pure word of god when he came down he was so illuminated with this word he had the glory all over his face and they still turned they couldn't handle it even secondarily coming from moses god was going to speak directly to them they couldn't handle that so they wanted one to go get the word but when that one brought the same pure word from god they still couldn't handle it amen because they weren't ready to receive the word yet so they had to turn and moses was forced to veil his face for the people not for himself for the people because they couldn't understand what was happening amen let's go to second corinthians together and i went to this as a to lay a foundation to where we want to go to second corinthians chapter 3. ii corinthians chapter 3. and let's look at verse 6. ii corinthians 3 and 6 who also have made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit so a new testament minister ministers the spirit not the letter the spirit amen the correct ministry in this day will minister the spirit amen not just give words not just read and repeat but it's got to minister the spirit amen so he's made us able ministers so an able minister of the new testament will not minister in the letter but will minister in the spirit amen that's very important to know for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but of the ministration of death written and engraved in stone he's talking about the law the old testament but if the ministration of death written and engraved in stone was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away because that word was to be done away when christ came how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious so if that was so glorious that they couldn't look onto moses face and that was a the ordinances that must pass away amen now there's coming one that's greater how much more glorious shall this one be amen for if the ministration verse 9 for the administration of condemnation be glory much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious so now the new testament the the word amen is that in this day is more glorious brother our brother brahman goes on to say in the unveiling of god and i'll be reading quite a few quotes from the unveiling of god it says paul's speaking here now in this sense here now and in this sense the spirit word we are ministers not of the letter the law but able ministers of the spirit that the spirit takes the letter and manifests it that was just law you had to go look at and say thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not lie thou shalt not do this that or the other you had to look at that but this is spirit that comes upon the promised word for this age and brings forth and manifests not two tables of stone but the presence of the living god so this amen this ministration of the spirit was not to to bring another letter of the law for you to look at and say now don't commit adultery now don't steal now don't do that all of those things remain true we're not to steal we're not to commit adultery we're not to do all of that but now it was not bringing forth an ordinance a law but now ministering the spirit that will actually take the nature of god and live it amen not just say don't commit adultery and hold yourself back by a law but you don't commit adultery because the spirit is manifesting the life and so now the spirit comes upon the promised word for this age this is what brother bam is saying the spirit comes upon the promised word for this age and brings forth and manifests not two tables of stone but the presence of the living god amen so what are we looking for in this day not another ordinance amen the message is not a book of ordinances amen some people have taken the message as a book of ordinances and we can't do this because the prophet said we can't do that because the prophet said and all they've done is turned the prophet amen back they've taken the message and made another law out of it but this is the ministration of the spirit the very spirit of jesus christ being ministered in the message to come and live the very presence of god in our midst not it's to bring forth not two tables of stone praise be the god but not two tables of stone but the presence of the living god this is so much different than that amen so we don't want to take this glorious message and turn it back into ordinances amen what it is bringing is the spirit that will make us live everything the prophet of god said if he said god is not like this and god doesn't like this and god does like this we can try in our human effort to measure up to that in an old testament way of measuring up but that's still not it because that letter brought death amen not life but when you see that and receive the spirit of the one who spoke that now that spirit lives in you and if god doesn't like it you don't do it not by ordinances but by a life but the presence of the living god it's not bringing back two tables of stone but the spirit that comes upon the promised world for this age is bringing the presence of the living god not a mythical thought somebody made up or some houdini a trick but the very promise of god revealed and made manifest right before us what sort of veil will that be behind it's a good question maybe a short man from kentucky with a seventh grade education amen now he goes on and say what about this glory he's referring to what we read in second corinthians what about this glory if that was veiled by a natural veil this is veiled by a spiritual veil so we realize the word must always be veiled because the unbeliever cannot stand the glory of the word they cannot see it amen so it must be behind a veil then it was a natural veil behind the veil that was covering moses face then what moses spoke amen went in behind the veil in the tabernacle and was veiled by badger skins so it was always veiled amen because they could not behold it amen that was a natural veil but now it's veiled by a spiritual veil so don't try to look at a natural break into the spirit and see where you're at see what our we're living in does it make sense to you it's a spiritual veil that's over the people say i'm methodist i'm as good as anybody i'm baptist i'm pentecostal don't you realize that the thing is a tradition a traditional veil so what is the spiritual veil that's on the people a traditional veil the true denominational traditional veil is a spiritual veil that is hiding the word from the people do you realize that that thing is a traditional veil it's hiding god from you praise be to god so what's hiding god now the spiritual veil what is the spiritual veil a denominational traditional veil that's hiding god from you he goes on to say he is veiled with a natural veil before he could speak the word to the people referring to moses now god has to veil himself as he promised in human flesh god don't you get it god has to avail himself in human flesh and put a spiritual veil over them so now where is god hiding god now is hiding in human flesh and putting a spiritual veil over them so that they can't see it and listen what he says god has to veil himself in human flesh and put a spiritual veil over them say well i'm this and i'm that do you see what he injected there he put a spiritual veil over them say i'm this and i'm that what's the spiritual veil i'm methodist i'm pentecostal i'm of this persuasion i'm of this flavor of the word i'm of this flavor of the message i'm aligned with this doctrine and i'm of this teaching and i'm of apollos and i'm of paul and i'm of cephas put a spiritual veil over them say well i'm of this and i'm of that in in order to speak to the people so god has to allow the spiritual veil so that he could speak to the people so he could speak through moses he had to come moses had to be veiled so god could bring or most god could bring the word through moses to the people it had to be veiled and so god could bring the word in this day he has to be hid in human flesh and put a spiritual veil over the people that they take their religious ideas and their camps and then in their different denomination and that's a spiritual veil so that they can't see god because god is hidden flesh now let's go on here in uh second corinthians let's continue second corinthians chapter three we'll go to verse 12 now seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished now i want you to stop for a minute and we're going to have to go slow to understand the scripture and he says we use great plainness of speech not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished moses had to cover his face so that the children could not look and see the end of the law so what was the end of the law it was what was hidden behind the veil what was hidden behind the veil the word in a man that's what this scripture is saying let's read it again with understanding and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished they couldn't see the glory of god in a human vessel he had developed so they couldn't see the end of the law would be god and a man praise god don't you love the bible but their mind now look at what he says but their minds were blinded their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ now their minds are blinded because unto this day the same veil remains there not a piece of cloth over moses face but the same thing that's causing them not to see god in a man now they couldn't see god in jesus christ god in the form of his sign now there was another veil they were blinded in their minds the same veil was there in the reading of moses he said brother jesus says you you read moses if you would have believed moses you would believe in me for moses spoke of me this is the end of that which is being abolished verse 14 but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart this is now a spiritual veil what gave them a spiritual veil their tradition their traditional understanding of the word became a spiritual veil that was on their heart because jesus christ amen was the the end of the law he was the end of the law amen and they could not look at moses and see the end of the law but here comes jesus christ the end of the law god manifest and flesh and now they couldn't see it but jesus had no piece of cloth over his face he had nothing over his face because now the veil was on their heart because they had already adapted a traditional understanding of what moses brought when moses brought it pure he was the word and he had to hide his face because they couldn't handle the pure word but once the tradition set in now it becomes a spiritual veil in their heart because of traditional teaching of the word and now jesus didn't have to cover his face even though we could behold the glory of the lord in the face of jesus christ amen but they couldn't behold it because of the veil over the heart because their minds were blinded see how powerful a traditional veil is amen but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when that shall be turned to the lord the veil shall be taken away brother brahm says in the unveiling of god moses was the veil the living word of god veiled behind human flesh the pillar of fire was in moses of course speaking what was to be veiled later behind skins you see now that the word the word was brought forth then it was written out then it was put behind and still veiled for god was always in that word amen he is the he's the word always he was in that word that's the reason that the word had to be veiled oh brother sister are you catching it look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be opened in the last days those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people that took place all along the hour of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah this last hour how that christ is put out of his church the son of god now he is he is revealed as son of man again how that the church is to be put in order in everything for the last day no creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual so what is it to put the church in order in the last days you go past the creed no denomination no church system it is god in the individual absolutely the word living in the individual that's what's to take place amen it's been veiled through these ages but it's to be open in the last days when those seals open and it would come into the full the thing full thing would come into the view of the people what's taken place all along and the hour of the seventh angels message all the mystery of god should be made known in that elijah the last hour praise be to god what's to be made known what is to be seen what is the results just absolutely the word living in the individual remember wherever the word is it must be veiled it was veiled behind badger skins it was veiled behind moses and now it's veiled in human flesh let's go on and read in our scripture let's read verse 16 again nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open faith now stop reading open face means unveiled face so we with an unveiled face so but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord let's read this slowly but we all with an unveiled face what unveiled our face the message of the hour the opening of the seals that last angel's message we all with open face beholding us in a glass a glass is a mirror now what do you see when you look in a mirror i want to ask you every one of you stopped for a minute when you look into the mirror who do you see you see the person next to you the person over when you look into a mirror you see your own reflection every one of us when we look into a mirror we see our own reflection now read this carefully but we all with open face beholding is in a mirror the glory of the lord when you look into this mirror with an open face before you could look into the mirror of the word and you see bible stories you can look into the mirror of the word and you say jesus christ you look into the mirror of the word you can even see that there's a malachi for prophet you can look into the word of the lord and you can see seven thunders amen but when you have an open face when you have an open face when the veil has been taken off of you amen when you become unveiled when you are unsealed when the veil is removed from your face and you look into this mirror you see the glory of the lord where does the glory of the lord appear the same place that appeared in moses amen it was on his face why because he was the word and when the word was with him he was god to the people and now the apostle paul is taking that type all the way here in second corinthians he's pulling it all through and now he's showing you amen now we with an open face an unveiled face when we look into this mirror we can see the glory of the lord [Music] listen as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord look at the challenge of the scripture we with an open face be holding us in a mirror the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory amen you say i want to be more like jesus christ you never will until first you have an open face and you look into this mirror and you see the glory of the lord looking back at you and then what you see by revelation you will become what you see and if you don't see it you won't become it you must first see the glory of the lord in the mirror with an open face and then you're changed into the image you behold from glory to glory this is why without the revelation of the seven seals amen the bride was never coming to a full maturity to reflect back jesus christ on this earth it took something that would take the veil off of the bride the veil off of the church and when they took the veil off she could look into the word and when she looked into the word she could see the glory of the lord reflecting off of her and when she saw the glory of the lord reflecting off of her then she had the power to be changed into what she was looking at so without revelation there is no growth without revelation there is no change without revelation without the opening of the seals and god revealing it personally to you you can see god amen manifesting moses that's wonderful you can see god manifest in the fulfillment of malachi 4 and brother branham that's wonderful you can say god is in his bride that's wonderful but unless the veil is taken off of your face and you personally as an individual look into the mirror of this word and see the glory of god if you don't see that you will never be changed into the image of the glory of god it'll never happen amen it doesn't happen by saying all these people are god all those people are god and the veil's been taken off by face and i see malachi 4. the veil is not just to be taken off of malachi 4. but the veil is to be taken off of the veil is to be removed from your face not just brother banner's face but your faith it's not that just god reveals to you who malachi 4 was who the elijah ministry was who the seventh angel was you can see all of that and you can still be blind you can read the word you can read about malachi 4. you can read revelation 10 7 you can read you can read you can even read amen revelation 10 8-11 and say yep the bride will prophesy though shall eat the book again but unless you see yourself there in revelations 10 8 unless that's you standing there going to the angel to take the book then you'll never become what you're looking at we can want to change and want to change and want to be different and want to be changed but you'll never change until you see in the mirror the glory of the lord you look at the word and if you look at the word and if it's reflecting everybody else to you keep looking till you see yourself amen keep looking till you see you in the word till you see this prophecies about me this story is about me when i read the woman at the well that's me amen i was in tradition i was going back to the well that my father's dug i was carrying my man-made pot amen so i could dip a little more water out of the well going back to the pentecostal church just to get a little bit more just enough for another day supply where did i and she had a question this is what my denomination teaches but the jewish denomination teaches you worship over there i'm going back to where my father's dug to well i'm going back to the place of my father's this is denominationalism she's taking her little man-made pot and scooping up a little more water just to get another another little bit for another day but jesus says i had needs to go by samaria i'm gonna free that little woman and when she comes in contact with god god begins to reveal her situation to her amen and she says i perceive you're a prophet amen when the same thing was done before the pharisees they thought he was beelzebub she thought he was a prophet and he says she says i perceive you're a prophet now the jews say we have to worship and as soon as she found out she's standing with a prophet she wants to know where to worship god and how to worship god she wants to know how do i worship god and when he begins to reveal it to her amen reveals that he's the messiah she leaves her water pot she's not gonna need this no more because jesus said if you drink from me amen out of your belly will flow you'll be a living well water will spring up you don't need the man-made pot you don't need the man-made dug well you don't need denominations anymore when you come in contact with jesus christ and drink from that well there's something springing up in you amen living water living water of life that never runs out you don't need the man-made well you don't need the man-made system you don't need the man-made pot to carry it you become the well you become the water source you become the fountain of living water now she didn't need to know about jerusalem she didn't need to know about samaria all she needed to know she found in jesus christ and what did she find she found that she was the will when i look at that story it's not about a woman in samaria that's me that's i see myself when the veil's taken off that's me i'm right there i'm in revelation 10 8 to 11. i i'm there i'm all the way in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride said come i'm there that's me why the seals the opening of the seals opened the seal of my life and took the veil from all my face and when i see the word i saw now in the mirror the glory of the lord where's the glory of the lord it's reflected in human flesh it's veiled it's hidden in human flesh and you can't see it till the veil is taken off of your face so you can see the glory of the lord and when that happens you're changed into the same image from glory to glory even it's by the spirit of the lord you see why denomination level the denominations could never produce this this is why partial belief can never produce this kind of life because you have to have something there has to be a revelation that will take the veil off of your own face as an individual that god will unveil you and when you look at the word amen you look into the mirror you see the glory of the lord in you and when you see that then you're changed into what you see so what's that mean you're changed into the revelation of who you are and when you catch the revelation of who you are you're changed into the image you're beholding by glory from glory unto glory without this revelation we're going nowhere without god personally revealing it to you amen we're going nowhere we're going to stay in the same run going around the same stump trying to solve the same problems never rising one bit higher because you're not going to get any higher than what you see in this mirror he said my life is going nowhere i keep going through the same ruts i keep going through the same problems i say get back into the message and pray for revelation say god i've got to see with an unveiled face what's looking at me in this mirror amen because without that i will never grow into the image of jesus christ until i see in the word jesus christ in me and when i see christ in me then whatever i see i will become it's a revelation friends that's why it's not more works more effort more trying harder more trying harder just means you get more tired and trying harder just usually means you fall harder because you hold out you hold out you hold out hold on strength until you have no strength left and then you crash and burn amen this is not the age for man-made religion for your own works amen this is god give a revelation so that we could see clearly with an unveiled face with a picture that's looking back in the mirror of god's word and we look back and we see jesus christ is hiding in flesh not over there not over there not over there but right here jesus christ is hiding in flesh and when i can see that i can be changed into that image from glory unto glory until you get that revelation you're going nowhere you're spinning your wheels in the mud hitting the gas trying harder forward back we're trying to get unstuck but what will unstuck the believer is a pure revelation of the word that's why chasing all kinds of things will never produce anything in our life we got to get to this word and say god show me your word clearly i want to see it in all its truth and all of its power and all of its clarity because it's the only hope we have for overcoming brother bam says in order to do this our denominational traditional veils must be broke in order to do this our denominational traditional veils must be broke by god's spirit of fire and sword which is his word what's going to rip the denominational traditional veil from us the word when we when we stay in that word and feed on that word and receive that word that word will remove the traditional denominational veil listen the the denominational veil does not go away because you attend a message church the traditional veil does not go away because you walk in those doors and sit in these pews it does not go away because you play a tape it goes away when the word is revealed to you and the word begins to tear away the tradition amen we can sit in something and repeat amen we can repeat phrases we can repeat catch phrases we can repeat what we're heard but it takes a genuine revelation by the holy ghost to come with a sword and rip that traditional fail and pull it away from your face so that you can see yourself in the lord he says always his word is a sword he took his sword that day full of fire and ripped that veil from top to bottom he does the same thing with the same word today not my creed my book of creeds my catechism but the sword of the lord see rips the veil down and you see god standing in plain view manifested in his word what a glorious view to look at see all right god's holy spirit and fire his sword rips it the word rips the denominational veil that's why we've got to stay in this word feed on this word i'll tell you sunday and wednesday is not enough word to overcome amen god that this is what this is this is the way we've been structured the prophet structured us this way we come here to hear the word of god preach because it's god's method and it's god's highest order of communication between god and man is the preaching of the word amen but you need this word every day to keep this traditional veil tore off of you if not you'll sleep slip back into spiritual amnesia forgetting who you are temporarily but we've got to stay in this word and let that sword continually keep the traditional mindset away from us it's so easy to slip back into traditional christian teaching and it's bringing blindness let's look at first corinthians 13 together first corinthians chapter 13. first corinthians 13 let's read verse 10 but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things so this is all about maturity this is all about growing up coming to full age into maturity so this that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away and as soon as he talks about the part done away when that which is perfect perfect means complete or whole or fully mature then he goes right into when i was a child i spake as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man when i became perfect full age adoption age i put away all those childish things now look at what he says for now we see through a glass this word glasses mirror so now we see through a mirror darkly now listen to what this word darkly means the greek word is i enigma and it means an obscure saying an enigma a riddle or a mystery an obscure saying it an obscure thing it's obscure it's not clear it's like a riddle you can't decipher it and look what he says for now we see through a mirror darkly you're looking in the mirror but it's obscure you can't get the right image in the mirror and i ask you again when you look at a mirror what are you looking at you're looking at yourself so now we look into a mirror but it's it's a mystery it's a riddle it's an enigma it's obscure you can't make out what you're looking at in the mirror for now we see through a mirror darkly but then face to face because when you look at a mirror you look face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known i'd ask you how well are you known you're known very well by the father but now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity this is what brother branham says in questions and answers in 1964 he quotes this scripture he says first corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect he's come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication amen this is not the day of partial amen this is not the day of childish day this is the day of full maturity because the word has come to full maturity the word has come to full light the word has been fully unveiled amen unsealed it's fully open now now is not the day of darkness now the day of light now is not the day of obscurity but now is the day of full revelation full light full everything and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then that which is in part is done away with when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child but when i become a man i put away childish things so we live in the day of the perfect word is that what he said and so now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now we live in the day where the mirror is not murky anymore the glass is not dark anymore now we can see face to face and when we look in the mirror what should we see the glory of the lord and when we see the glory of the lord in the mirror of the word where will that glory be hidden in flesh the most unlikely flesh to us none of us thought you know growing up those especially those who did not grow up in the message and never heard these kind of terms and these things before you grew up nobody was walking around and saying one day i'm gonna find god in me one day i'll see god in my face amen it took the message to peel that veil away so that we could see the word and in the word you could find out that god always wanted to live in flesh amen he wanted to be manifest in flesh he wanted to dwell in his people amen then you can see that one day you're going to find god and where are you going to find him you're going to find him in you amen because there was a seed gene of god laying in your soul from before the foundation of the world then when you come in contact with the living word for your age it'll quicken that seed to life and you'll look back into the word again and you'll say that that's that's me that's me the woman in samaria is me amen revelation 10 8 that's me he wasn't talking about another age or another people are somewhere far away he was talking about me this individual right here is going to flesh out that word right there [Music] amen what did it the revelation of the word took the veil off of our face so that we could see the glory of the lord and if we can see that we can be changed into what we behold from glory unto glory unto glory all the way till this flesh changes into perfection as well praise be to god brother branham he tells a story here in this message that i want to go through in the message of prisoner from 1963 he says i preached some time ago at a businessman meeting in phoenix arizona of the reflection of jesus reflecting christ christian life i said i was born up here in kentucky where it's very primitive especially back when i was a kid and this certain little boy never had a home like we have here where we we had so many pretty ladies that have to look through mirrors all through the house to keep their hair just in place and so forth but he had one little mirror just a little piece tacked on a tree on the outside where the wasp bench was where his mother and father washed and they combed their hair and so forth from this little piece of an old mirror tacked on a tree and he says frankly that's the type of home that we live we have anybody wants to see a mirror we kids we had to get a box and get up on the wash bench he's talking about when he grew up as a little boy if we wanted to see in the mirror we had to get a box and get up on the old wash bench and look in this piece of a mirror that i picked up myself in a dump that wasn't down in kentucky that's here in indiana up on utica pike here brother ma'am he was talking about this little boy in kentucky and he was typing it with his own life and boy in kentucky he didn't ever have a proper mirror he just had a little one tacked up on a tree and brother branham describes this mirror he said it was like what he had and he describes his childhood and he says here he picked it up in a dump just a little piece of a broken mirror and they would nail it to a tree and bend the nails over to hold it so there was a little piece of broken mirror on on a tree and they couldn't see it at the little kids unless they got a box and got up on the wash bench and the bench was attached to an apple tree he said with a leg on one side and dad would fill it with wash water and he'd wash up before he went in the house and he would look in that little mirror and comb his hair and mom would comb her hair and just a little piece of broken mirror he got out of the dumb he said if us kids wanted to see in it we had to climb up to look inside but he goes on with the story he says now this little kid had never exactly seen himself like that so he come to the city to visit his grandma it's an it's a it's on the tour of the room that grandma had a house that he had a that had a complete mirror on the door i want you to catch that phrase a complete mirror on the door and so a little boy running through the room seen another little boy in front of him and the little boy was running also so he thought he should stop a few minutes and see what that little lad was going to do and when he stopped the little boy stopped when he turned his head the little boy turned his head he scratched his head the little boy scratched says finally walking closer to investigate and he turned around and his mother watching him and his grandmother with amazement said why mother that's me amen brother branham remember what i talked to uh last week amen that these aren't stories these are parables brother branham preaches the same way jesus preached amen and when jesus preached he would start to tell stories about a man who had two sons and this one had a field and he lent it out and he starts telling these stories and these stories are parables and brother branham teaches he preaches the same way jesus christ preached and now he's telling us this little boy all he had was a piece of broken mirror you know how broken mirror is you know it's not steady on the edges and so it's a little distorting the edges maybe a crack running through it if you want to comb your hair you kind of have to move your head you can't even see you can only see so much of yourself you probably can't even see your whole hairline amen until you move your head a little bit and make sure that the left and the right side is okay all right we're okay and we move on if a little boy wanted to see anything he had to get a box and climb up and just peek up into it and he might see a little bit of his face or all of his face who knows how much amen but but this little boy who can only see so much of himself listen that little broken mirror is denominational traditional ideas it's only a little view of the word amen luther had a little view of the word wesley had a little view of the word pentecost had a little view of the word why because the nomination that came and broke up the word and they each grabbed a piece of broken mirror and they could only see a little bit in this mirror but this little boy when he went on a journey amen he come to a place that had a complete mirror and i want to tell you that there's a complete mirror that's been restored at the end of the ages this message has brought a complete full length perfect mirror no cracks no missing pieces amen it's all been put back together and made perfect and i'll tell you what else this mirror is not distorted it's not bent on the edges it's not twisted it's not flex amen it doesn't give you back a funny view of yourself you know if somebody takes the word and they bend it and they take this mirror and they bend it amen you'll get an odd reflection of yourself and you'll walk away horrified because you're three foot tall and 500 pounds that's what man does to the word and when you look into man's broken piece of the word in man's distorted word amen it always gives you the wrong picture of yourself you either can't see all of yourself or what you see is twisted up and distorted until you walk away with the wrong view of who you are but in this day we've got a complete mirror a perfect mirror a perfect word by god's grace we have a perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication the word has been restored and now you can stand in front of that mirror and know what god's idea was of you before the foundation of the world how he wants you to live how he wants you to dress how he wants you to speak how he wants you to talk what the reflection of jesus christ in a female form should look like because the word has been restored and when you look in that you see yourself the way god wants you to look the way god sees you and when you see that you can be changed into that image from glory and to glory by the spirit of the lord not by might not by power but by my spirit but you'll never be changed into that image until you get in front of the mirror the full mirror listen i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but if you have stopped at malachi 4 you're not standing in front of the complete mirror because you can see him but you can't see yourself and he came so that you could see yourself he had to come to restore the word so that the mirror would be brought back so that you could see yourself in the word so that you could become what you see this message is so vitally critical there is no other way than this message to please god in this day there is no other way to be formed into the image of christ there is no other way to be a proper christian outside of this word that has been restored everything else is a distorted view everything else is a partial view a broken view a distorted view this message is the only perfect word it's the only correct view it's the only thing that will unveil your face give you the right image of the way god sees you and give you the power to become what you're looking at there will be no other way to rise any higher than your ability to see what god sees in you because when we're changed by what we behold we're changed into the image we behold so if you're looking at a partial image you're only going to have a partial life if you're looking at a distorted image you'll always have a distorted life but the only way to have a full perfect life is to have a full perfect image you can't have a full perfect image without a full perfect word so there is no way in this day to live a christian life without this message and then you're changed the image you behold from glory and to glory by the spirit of the lord it's not you it's the same one who restored the mirror is the same one who unveiled your face to look in the mirror is the same one who will change you into the image that you behold from glory unto glory it's the spirit of revelation it's the holy spirit that reveals to you who you really are and until you see that you will never become what the bride is supposed to be in this day praise be to god brother ben says in the unveiling of god he said notice then when we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you are part of him as long as christ is in you as christ was of god because god was in him made him god and as christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of christ he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also see you become part of christ as long as christ is hid in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing christ i love this quote you are templing christ that's behind the veil the skin once again god is behind skin you are tempting christ that's behind the veil of the skin then we be behind because of this veil the veil again in human flesh hides god the word you catch that because of this veil the veil again in human flesh which flesh is he talking about your flesh my flesh hides god the word what is god the word what is the word god hides god the word from the unbeliever it's on display and hidden we with an open face we behold we with uh clear speech proclaim it but there's a veil a traditional veil on the heart of those that hear and only revelation will take that veil away again in the unveiling of god he says like he was in moses when the word was in moses he was god and flesh when it was in jesus it was god in flesh see only thing he done was change his mask not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from noah to moses he changed from moses to david from david joseph on down until he come into the fullness of the godhead bodily see it's still the same god amen i hope that gets through it's the same god but he just takes on another veil see he puts on another veil he did it in the reformers guess it's the same god just changing his veil changing his mask he did it in the reformers taking on a veil taken on a veil until finally it come down through the lutheran age down through the other age then finally it comes out into the complete so what is this he's veiled in this and veiled in this and veil all the way from luther to wesley to pentecost until finally it comes out in the complete now catch very carefully follow me just before it comes what jesus christ coming out and complete just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back there revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be not without understanding then when this fades out listen friends it's going to come out into complete it's coming to the full complete but just before it comes to the full complaint a prophet will arise so the prophet arising is not coming to the complete before it comes to the complete the prophet arises because the prophet is a four he's a forerunner amen the prophet comes to reveal what god's going to do amen so you can't stop at the prophet the prophet's coming to show you something god's doing so just before it comes into the complete a prophet arises and when this fades out what fades out that profit fades out when this fades out then like john said i must decrease he must increase then all in all comes into him now it moves into completion what was the prophet here to do he was here to unite christ and the bride together he was here to manifest the son of man so it's so manifest that it will it will unite the christ and the bride together again and then the fullness of christ pours into that bride and she becomes the full reflection of the word that's him incomplete now all in all has moved into this picture amen and so if you stop at the prophet you miss what he came to do he is fully manifested through luther wesley pentecostal age on down on down he is fully manifested you see come down just a manifestation god unfolding see him fulfilled in his promise for this day as they had it just before it comes into completeness a prophet rises on the scene and when this begins to fade out like john said i must decrease he must increase then all in all comes into him oh praise god so we've got to move amen we've got to believe this prophet we've got to take what he said he restored the mirror he put the word back together he un he opened the seals he unveiled the bride amen so that that message could take the veil off of your face so that you could look into that mirror and see who you really are and when the bride comes to that all in all moves in so that this bride becomes the complete reflection the veil that's temple in christ let's turn to james chapter one james chapter 1 and i'm going to read from verse 22. james chapter 1 verse 22 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only i want you to stop for a minute we have heard the word in just generation is that correct but god never sent the word for us to hear he sent the word for us to live to manifest to demonstrate to be living epistles read of all men he didn't just give us the word to read and say wow that's good word but that that word would become manifest in us he said but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is likened to a man be holding his natural face in a glass a mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was here's a man he's typing now somebody who hears the word and doesn't do it is like a man who goes up into a mirror and he sees himself and he turns around and as soon as he turns around he forgot what he saw he forgot what manner of man he was he slips back into amnesia he forgot who he was he forgot what he saw amen and if we look into the word and we don't begin to live the word we have looked into the mirror saw who we are but then go live some other kind of life amen then go chase some other kind of dream so get involved in something else that's not the word amen that's not for us amen when we look at this word we're a doer of the word we're a liver of the word we're an expresser of the word we are a manifesto of this word so if we look at the word and turn and walk away you're just like somebody who looked into the mirror and turned and they forgot what manner of man they were amen you slipped back in the spiritual amnesia you look right at the word amen right at the message and brother man i'm screaming out who the bride is where jesus christ is what the manifestation of the hour is and we turn around and live a compromised life and live for the world and just willy-nilly whatever and we we looked but we forgot we walked out the door on sunday and on monday we forgot who we were we forgot we were the word yes we come on wednesday night when we wake up thursday morning and go to work and we forgot we were the word oh praise god but we're supposed to look into the mirror and know who we are and turn around and live what we saw brother brahm says in spiritual amnesia and another thing that causes it among the people is getting between two opinions oh friends this man who behold himself in the mirror turned around and straightway forgot what manner of man he was he went right back into amnesia we listen to the prophet screaming sunday we say amen wednesday we say amen we're the bride of jesus christ amen we're to live the life of christ amen amen and immediately return and forgot what we heard and what causes this amnesia to forget who you are it's being stuck between two opinions two opinions about the word two opinions about the life two opinions on uh it could be two opinions you could have you could have two personalities you could have a work personality and a home personality and you're stuck between two opinions i live one way away from the believers i live another way with the believers i live one way at home i live another way away from home i'm one way in church but i'm a different way outside of church if you get stuck between two opinions you're going to look at that mirror and turn around and forget who you are because you'll be a hearer of the word a hearer of the revelation but not a liver not living the word not living the revelation what can cause this getting between two opinions i say friends with everything that's in us let's die to ourselves and take one opinion and that opinion is this message let's forget all our own opinions everybody else's opinions and let's line everything up in our lives to this word and if you've got trouble living one way one place and one way another i would say cut off all associations cut off every bit of form of entertainment or all other reading and dive into this word and nothing else until you can get into one opinion amen so god can change you and wake you up and break spiritual amnesia off of you and you know who you are and you're the same person at work as you are at church as you are at home as you are all by yourself away thousands away miles away from every believer that you'll be the exact same person amen because if not you get caught between two opinions and you forget who you are when i say god let me stay in this word till i've got one opinion of who i am one opinion of this word one opinion of the message one way to live my life and that's for you to live in me amen we need to devote ourselves to this word because it breaks our spiritual amnesia so then that'll cause amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you don't know who you are you can identify yourself you can walk around eating everything but you still can identify yourself amen who are you well i'm so and so and i'm a mechanic down at so-and-so shop you got spiritual amnesia well i'm i'm i'm this and that and and i live in this home and this is my mom and this is my my dad you got spiritual amnesia until everything starts with i'm a son of god and i work in that shop over there i'm a son of god amen part of his bride and i live in this home i'm a son of god and i'm married to that sister there i'm married to that brother there tell you don't have to say that with everything you say but the mentality is always the same you're always a son of god you're always part of christ you're always reflecting christ in everything we do he said when you get in this amnesia you can eat you can talk you can walk around you can work you can do everything but you can't identify yourself listen i i want to say this from the bottom of my heart but there's so many people in the message that cannot identify themselves they attached themselves to a prophetic ministry they believed brother bannon was a prophet they believed that god sent him that he fulfilled all these scriptures but they have no idea what scriptures they're supposed to fulfill they know who he was but they don't know who they are and he came to bring an identification to the bride so that we would know who we are amen if we know who he is that's wonderful but he came to reveal who we are so that we know who we are how many people can't identify themselves they know what's been taught they know the major doctrines but they're still in doubt whether or not they're a son of god they're still questioning whether they'll go in the rapture they're still worried about whether or not they're in the bride or whether they'll make it or not amnesia see let's come down to one opinion one opinion you can walk around eat everything but you still can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education some education you had but you don't know where it come from you don't know who you are where you belong that's amnesia so we're told i don't want spiritual amnesia i don't want to look at this message and turn around and forget who i really am but the man said it was a great day when i realized i wasn't the son of charles and ella branham he knew who he really was he had looked in the mirror and got a true identification of himself and he saw the glory of the lord his amnesia was broken and the message god's provided place of worship he says the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost of the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man so what is the perfection of the son of man this next sentence is what he's going to identify as a perfection of the son of man i thought i thought the perfection of the son of man was back there in the 60s no that was a son of man revealing the son of man but the perfection of the son of man is that when husband and wife will be the same self-persons that's the perfection of the son of man that when she looks in that mirror she sees christ and when christ looks at her he sees christ so that we're reflecting the word i'm going to read that again it'll go through the baptism in the holy ghost where the pentecostals will go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self-persons god will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at i think god the prophet came and he put the mirror back together and then god would pluck up the word in that vessel and wave it over the people showing this is what you're coming to this is the first revelation of the bride one with spiritual amnesia broken one that come into the that come in union with christ so much that christ could use that vessel so much that people would be confused on which was jesus christ and which wasn't and he was the wave chief showing us that that maturity is what the whole bride is coming to i thank god for that but that wave chief was to encourage me that whatever god did to bring him to there he can bring me the same way that's my goal that's my target that's what i'm going to do not looking back but looking forward i look back to what god waved over us and said praise god that's what i'm growing to that's what i'm becoming amen i'm becoming a child of god in the full stature of jesus christ in human flesh growing into the head and i say thank god for that lord grow us into that image i want to read one more scripture first corinthians chapter 11. musicians if you want to make your way up first corinthians 11 verse 7. now remember what we read we with an unveiled face looking into a glass or changed into the image that we behold or we behold the glory of the lord but i want to read first corinthians 11 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god that was jesus christ the perfect man the last adam he was the image of the invisible god but the woman is the glory of the man the woman is the glory of the man the bride is the glory of jesus christ and when we with open face beholding is in a glass the glory of the lord because the woman is the glory of the man and this bride is the glory of jesus christ and when we see that then we're changed into that image from glory unto glory by the spirit of the lord say i thank god for this message i thank god for a mirror that's not broken that's not distorted that's not twisted but it's a perfect mirror of the word that you can look into and get a proper identification of who you really are and if we can stay in one opinion not halt between two but one opinion we can live in this world with an understanding of who we are and spiritual amnesia can be broke off of us friends man let's all stand i say god let me see a clear image in this mirror take this word the revelation of this word by your spirit and take the traditional veil off of my heart take the veil off of my face so that when i see i'm not reading about stories of old people long time ago or things that happen somewhere else but i can see that's me that's me that's me that's me i'm there and rahab the heart i'm there in ruth amen i'm there i'm all the way through i'm there in mary mary's proclaiming me amen i'm there and i'm there and i'm there and i'm there what is it it's me mama it's me oh father i see it now it's me this is what you've been trying to get me to see i've been looking at this little fragment of a mirror and trying to see this and trying to see this but now i see what you've been trying to do all along through this whole bible you're trying to restore us back to what we lost at eid where you get the male and the female back together as one again i can see it now and i see my part and you've broken amnesia away from me i say i thank god for this word amen without this message we had no hope without this message we could never be what we're called to be in this day but thank god he put the mirror back in its place man let's bow our heads together and thank the lord lord jesus i thank you god for your word oh god i pray that you would help us to see more clearly than we have ever seen before in our lives god as we look into this mirror as individuals lord not collectively as a group but one by one we come to this word and we look at it lord take the veil off of our faith lord god by your revelation power by the power of your spirit to bring a revelation take every remaining trace of denominationalism out of our heart take this word and rip that veil and keep ripping it till it's all gone lord we don't want a tradition holding us back and blinding us lord we don't want even traditional understanding of the message to hold us back we want to die to all of that lord take that word and rip it out of us lord god uncover our faith so that we can see what you're seeing so that we can get a true reflection lord of what you're doing in this age and what you want us to be and go on by the power of your spirit would you change us into that image from glory to glory god we love you we love you for what you've done in this age we love you for what you've done in our lives we love you for what you're still doing in our lives and we trust you to complete the work that you've begun god i want to look more singularly at your word than i ever have before in my life i want to be of one opinion in one mind and with one focus viewing one thing all the days of my life so that i can become what i'm looking at god change us mold us make us more like you lord let us finish in this hour
