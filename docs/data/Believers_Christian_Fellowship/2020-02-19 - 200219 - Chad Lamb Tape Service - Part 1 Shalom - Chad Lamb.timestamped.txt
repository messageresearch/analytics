[2:04] before we get started i just want to go
[2:06] into a couple of announcements
[2:08] i want to remind everybody that the
[2:10] church is going to be open for prayer
[2:12] on friday and this is going to stay the
[2:15] same every friday and saturday until
[2:17] you know we announce otherwise if the
[2:18] lord changes our plans
[2:20] but for now it'd be friday from 1 p.m to
[2:23] 5 p.m
[2:24] and saturday from 5 p.m to 10 p.m so if
[2:27] you'd like to gather together and pray
[2:29] if god moves on your heart you have a
[2:30] desire to do so
[2:31] the doors of the church will be open
[2:33] we're here to pray and we have no agenda
[2:36] we have no plan i just feel in my heart
[2:39] to do it so we're going to do it
[2:41] amen if you feel in your heart to pray
[2:43] come and pray if you can make it
[2:45] it's going to be an open house format
[2:46] we're not going to be speaking there's
[2:48] not going to be anything going on we'll
[2:49] just be playing the pre-service music
[2:51] quietly
[2:51] you come in and pray you can pray in
[2:53] your seat pray at the altar
[2:54] come anytime in that period of time you
[2:56] want to come leave whenever you feel
[2:58] that you're done
[2:59] and we'll just be locking up afterwards
[3:01] at five o'clock
[3:02] on friday and then we're locking the
[3:04] doors at 10 pm on saturday
[3:07] but but i just feel in my heart it's a
[3:09] time of consecration
[3:11] and preparation you you know we don't
[3:13] want to take the pentecostal idea if we
[3:15] can't pray anything into existence
[3:18] we can't force anything to happen by our
[3:20] own efforts our own merits
[3:22] we're not trying to force god's hands
[3:24] we're not trying to create anything
[3:25] all we're trying to do is get ourselves
[3:27] quiet prepared
[3:29] ready consecrated for whatever god wants
[3:32] to do
[3:32] and i believe he wants to do things i
[3:34] believe he's moving and he's wanting to
[3:35] mature us and
[3:36] i believe he's wanting to speak to us
[3:38] and open our eyes and ears and
[3:40] and i want to be consecrated and
[3:41] dedicated unto him
[3:43] i want to consecrate the sanctuary i
[3:45] want to consecrate the gifts i want to
[3:47] consecrate ourselves unto him and so if
[3:49] you feel in your heart to do that
[3:51] we'd appreciate that i also want to
[3:53] remind everybody that we'd like to make
[3:55] 30 minutes prior to the first song
[3:57] quiet time in the sanctuary for prayer
[3:59] and meditation you can pray
[4:01] at the altar you can pray at your seat
[4:03] read your bible
[4:04] but just be conscious of that amen if
[4:06] you can make it
[4:07] and and this this i'd like to share with
[4:10] you
[4:11] i don't want this to be an obligation
[4:13] i'm not saying that to be an obligation
[4:16] i'm not saying it for any kind of
[4:17] pressure amen if it's not
[4:19] in your heart to do it then there's no
[4:21] obligation
[4:22] if you don't feel impressed in your
[4:24] spirit that god wants you here
[4:26] 30 minutes before consecrating yourself
[4:29] praying
[4:30] praying for the gifts praying for the
[4:31] song leader praying for the musicians
[4:33] praying for the freedom of the spirit to
[4:34] move praying for everybody that will
[4:36] come in
[4:37] if you're not anointed to do it then
[4:38] don't come in and do it
[4:40] right because there's no pressure
[4:42] nobody's going to think you're the bad
[4:44] believer
[4:45] we don't want to pressure anybody and do
[4:47] anything but i just want to remind you
[4:48] brother brennan mentioned that to us for
[4:50] a reason there's a reason he said it and
[4:52] i believe there's a great benefit in it
[4:54] but we got to catch it in the right
[4:55] spirit
[4:56] we got to do it for the right reasons
[4:58] everything our attitude our approach
[5:00] matters i mean there's no arm twisting
[5:03] there's not going to be any pushing in
[5:05] it's none of those things friends but
[5:07] this is something that the prophet
[5:08] suggested
[5:09] the prophet said it'd be good to do and
[5:11] i believe it'd be good to do it
[5:13] but we've got to come with the right
[5:14] approach with the right mental attitude
[5:16] with the right desire in our heart
[5:18] and come reverently and because of that
[5:20] just be conscious as you come in
[5:22] don't come in loud don't come in you
[5:24] know be conscious don't rattle bags and
[5:27] papers and plastic bags and paper
[5:29] and all of that don't be distracting in
[5:31] any way just come in because we want to
[5:32] create an atmosphere
[5:34] quiet prayer amen where we can dedicate
[5:36] ourselves to the lord
[5:37] and prepare ourselves on wednesday
[5:40] nights we know it's tough
[5:42] some people come straight from work but
[5:43] if we catch the right attitude
[5:46] if we understand what we're doing is
[5:48] that we're not just
[5:49] marching in and we're not just plopping
[5:52] down and expecting god to speak but
[5:54] we're actually preparing ourselves to
[5:56] hear from god
[5:57] we're preparing ourselves to worship god
[5:59] it's a preparation
[6:01] it's because what we're doing is so
[6:03] important
[6:04] that it deserves some preparation
[6:06] thought so sometimes some of you there's
[6:08] no way you can possibly be here early
[6:11] you just barely make it from work that's
[6:13] understandable but as you're driving and
[6:15] remember
[6:15] you're preparing play a tape
[6:19] instrumental music sing in the car
[6:21] together but just have that attitude of
[6:23] preparation as you come
[6:24] don't just march in don't be busy in
[6:26] your mind don't just bluster through the
[6:28] door and sit down
[6:29] and expect the magic to take place amen
[6:32] we got to prepare ourselves to worship
[6:34] god we've got to prepare ourselves to
[6:35] hear from him
[6:36] so just take that attitude if you can't
[6:38] be here early that's okay but just take
[6:40] the attitude of preparation
[6:41] and come prepared amen god bless you
[6:45] i believe god will honor that i believe
[6:46] with all my heart god will honor that
[6:49] amen i also want to let you know that
[6:52] we've got new books for the book rack
[6:54] like i do every year
[6:56] beginning of the year i got six more so
[6:58] the bottom the book rack out here by the
[7:00] door the top
[7:01] are never changing they're in the order
[7:03] that i'd like for them to be read in i
[7:05] like the whole church to read them in
[7:06] that order
[7:07] on the top six but the bottom six that
[7:09] they rotate
[7:10] but for the next few months they're
[7:12] going to stay stationary because i got
[7:13] six new titles
[7:15] i got shalom which we're going to be
[7:16] going through in the next couple of
[7:18] wednesdays broken cisterns why it had to
[7:21] be shepherds
[7:22] this day this scripture is fulfilled the
[7:25] god of this evil age
[7:26] and satan's eden so i'd like for
[7:28] everybody to read through those in the
[7:30] next couple months if you can i like it
[7:33] when we're all
[7:34] on the same page we're all feasting on
[7:37] the same things
[7:38] so god bless you all right well tonight
[7:42] we're gonna
[7:43] we're gonna listen to shalom i just want
[7:45] to remind you
[7:47] respond to the word just because it's a
[7:49] tape and not a preacher here in the
[7:51] pulpit doesn't mean we have to sit quiet
[7:52] amen if something strikes your heart say
[7:54] amen amen if you feel like waving your
[7:56] hand wave your hand
[7:58] amen just feed on the word like we
[7:59] always feed on the word and respond to
[8:01] the word
[8:03] this message shalom we're going to be
[8:06] reviewing the one
[8:06] listening to the one from january 12
[8:10] 1964. it's the first message brother
[8:12] branham preaches in 1964
[8:15] and he calls it his new year's message
[8:17] and so we want to know where we're at in
[8:19] time
[8:20] what what he's preaching and why
[8:23] but i'd like for you as brother ben is
[8:26] preaching this this is what i always do
[8:27] and this is one of the reasons i like
[8:29] doing a tape service
[8:30] is because we've always got young people
[8:33] coming up we've got new people coming in
[8:35] and i like to do this as a reminder so
[8:37] we all are are
[8:38] learning how to feed on the word that
[8:41] it's not just playing a tape
[8:43] as background noise or playing a tape to
[8:45] fulfill some sort of quota as playing a
[8:47] tape
[8:48] amen are reading a book we don't read
[8:49] our bible that way we don't go to prayer
[8:51] that way we don't listen to the message
[8:52] that way
[8:53] but this is what god wanted stored up
[8:56] for us for this
[8:57] hour that we live in this is the things
[8:59] that we need to hear
[9:01] to overcome the enemy and the hour that
[9:03] we're alive
[9:04] so don't make it a tape from 1964 amen
[9:07] you take it a tape
[9:09] that was stored up in 1964 to be pulled
[9:11] off the shelf
[9:12] to give us something we need right here
[9:14] today so everything the prophet says
[9:16] bring it home
[9:17] amen everything it says bring it right
[9:19] to us bring it right to us
[9:21] individually right to the day we live in
[9:23] right to our assembly right
[9:25] right to our homes amen because that's
[9:28] why it was stored up it was for us
[9:31] so don't don't let that go some of you
[9:34] have
[9:35] phones that you're following along on or
[9:37] tablets and so you'll be using the table
[9:39] app that's perfectly all fine
[9:40] we'll be having it on the overhead
[9:42] screen as well the words will be
[9:43] scrolling so you can watch it there as
[9:44] you listen
[9:45] we've got the books also if you didn't
[9:47] get a book as a
[9:49] when we start to play you can slip out
[9:50] at the welcome desk there's a bunch of
[9:52] them there
[9:53] and get you a book but if you look at
[9:55] the book the title with shalom
[9:57] i every time i grab a book i look at the
[10:00] title
[10:01] well there's a couple things i do i want
[10:03] to know when he preached it
[10:05] and where it is in the order of services
[10:07] he preached this january 1964 the first
[10:10] message in 1964.
[10:12] we know 1963 was a huge year
[10:16] so many supernatural things happening we
[10:18] know we had
[10:19] uh started off the year with brother
[10:21] branham moving out to arizona
[10:23] and he has the experience of the sword
[10:24] in the hand then he gets caught up into
[10:26] the constellation of
[10:27] angels and he comes back and preaches
[10:29] the seals then he preaches christ is the
[10:30] mystery of god revealed
[10:32] and so in the token and so many other
[10:33] things 1963 was a huge year
[10:36] so now he's coming into the transition
[10:38] on the calendar
[10:39] to another year of 1964 and this is his
[10:41] first message
[10:42] so when i pick up a message and i play
[10:44] it started those are the things i think
[10:46] about i want to know where we are
[10:47] what's happened before where we are now
[10:50] where
[10:50] where is the prophet why is he bringing
[10:53] the message he's bringing in the
[10:54] sequence that he's bringing it in
[10:56] and then i look at the title shalom and
[10:58] i try to hold that title in my mind the
[11:00] whole time i listen to this tape
[11:02] because there's a reason he titles it
[11:04] the way he titles it and this is what he
[11:06] wants to tell us
[11:07] shalom so the message to us is shalom
[11:11] so the next two hours and 20 minutes is
[11:13] going to be about
[11:14] shalom amen
[11:18] so i'm going to give you
[11:22] a couple questions here i like to do
[11:25] this too
[11:26] it keeps us all on the same page so if
[11:28] you've got a pen and paper you like to
[11:29] write it down or
[11:30] write it in the first part of your book
[11:34] i'm going to ask four questions and as
[11:37] we listen to the tape the questions will
[11:38] be answered
[11:39] and then we'll get up at the end and
[11:40] make some comments and go through the
[11:42] questions and make some
[11:43] maybe some additional comments i'm not
[11:45] going to get far into the message we're
[11:47] going to listen to about 44 minutes of
[11:48] it today
[11:49] because there's some things i just want
[11:50] to highlight and share i'm not in a
[11:52] hurry
[11:53] i'm not trying to get this done quickly
[11:55] just as the lord leads
[11:56] i'd like to spend some time with this
[11:58] message over the next couple of
[12:00] wednesdays
[12:01] so the first question what is a rock
[12:05] in scripture so many of you know the
[12:09] answer
[12:09] most of you maybe but but it's good to
[12:12] hear
[12:12] what the brother venom has to say it's
[12:14] really good what is a rock in scripture
[12:17] number one number two what is shalom
[12:24] none of these are difficult number three
[12:28] what is the effect of gross darkness now
[12:31] that's going to be a good one
[12:34] what is the effect of gross darkness
[12:40] so number one was what is a rock in
[12:42] scripture
[12:43] number two what is shalom number three
[12:46] what is the effect of gross darkness
[12:51] and number four how is the invisible god
[12:54] manifested
[12:56] that's another really good one we're
[12:58] going to get into in the beginning of
[13:00] this
[13:01] so number four how is the invisible god
[13:06] manifested
[13:11] all right now i'd like to open our
[13:15] bibles and read two scriptures brother
[13:17] i'm going to read to them but i'd like
[13:18] for us to go through it in our bible
[13:20] first and there's a reason he reads the
[13:22] scriptures he's reading brother brenda's
[13:23] not just reading a scripture
[13:24] just to have a scripture to open with so
[13:27] let's
[13:27] let's meditate on these scriptures as
[13:29] well so this first one is going to be
[13:31] isaiah 60.
[13:34] isaiah chapter 60. we're going to read
[13:36] from verse 1. so let's go through this
[13:38] together
[13:39] isaiah 60
[13:43] and verse 1.
[13:47] all right we're going to read verse 1
[13:48] and 2. arise
[13:51] shine for thy light has come oh my
[13:54] goodness i'm so excited already
[13:58] this scripture is a commandment telling
[14:01] you to arise and shine
[14:04] it's not telling the sun to arise and
[14:06] shine
[14:07] it's telling you to arise and shine
[14:10] be really careful that we catch what's
[14:13] being said
[14:14] arise shine this is the message to you
[14:17] arise shine for thy light is come
[14:22] and the glory of the lord is risen
[14:26] upon thee
[14:29] you see brother ben's going to preach
[14:31] shalom amen
[14:33] verse 2 for behold the darkness shall
[14:36] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[14:38] people
[14:39] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[14:42] his glory shall be seen upon thee
[14:44] so behold the darkness shall cover the
[14:46] earth and
[14:47] gross darkness so there's darkness and
[14:49] gross darkness
[14:51] darkness upon all the earth but gross
[14:53] darkness upon the people
[14:56] so then people will be their minds will
[14:58] be darkened their minds will be blinded
[15:01] gross darkness the people but the lord
[15:04] shall arise so who's going to rise the
[15:07] lord
[15:08] shall arise where will he arise
[15:11] upon thee not on the rising over there
[15:14] and arising over there
[15:15] but he's arising upon thee
[15:19] and his glory shall be seen upon
[15:23] thee so
[15:26] where are you going to point people to
[15:28] it's got to be the living manifested
[15:30] word
[15:31] let's turn over to psalm 62. this is the
[15:34] second scripture
[15:36] passage that brother branham opens with
[15:38] this message psalm
[15:39] 62
[15:43] it's hard not to preach when you read
[15:44] the scriptures
[15:47] psalm 62
[15:50] verse 1. we're going to read one to
[15:54] eight
[15:56] truly my soul waiteth upon god from him
[15:59] cometh my salvation
[16:01] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[16:04] is my defense
[16:05] i shall not be greatly moved how long
[16:08] will you imagine mischief against a man
[16:10] you shall be slain all of you as a
[16:13] bowing wall
[16:14] shall you be and as a tottering fence
[16:17] they only consult to cast him down from
[16:19] his excellency
[16:20] they delight in lies they bless with
[16:22] their mouth but they curse inwardly
[16:25] sila my soul waiteth thou only upon god
[16:28] for my expectation is from him
[16:31] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[16:34] is my defense i shall not be moved
[16:37] and god is my salvation in my glory the
[16:40] rock of my strength
[16:42] and my refuge is in god trust in him at
[16:45] all times ye people pour out your heart
[16:47] before him
[16:48] god is a refuge for us sila
[16:51] praise the lord those are the two
[16:53] scriptures brother brian's going to open
[16:54] with
[16:55] so if you take your book and open up to
[16:57] page one
[16:58] we're going to begin on the fourth line
[17:00] where brother branham says
[17:02] uh good morning friends so brother

[17:05] that up and start that

[17:52] brother that was with us the last time
[17:54] he has got
[17:55] cancer in the hospital we know that
[17:59] we only have one avenue out of this
[18:02] and that's the avenue of death as we all
[18:05] have got to walk that path
[18:07] whether it be the most righteous the
[18:10] most holy one of us
[18:11] we pack one another over the other one's
[18:13] grave and yet jesus said
[18:15] he that leaveth to me shall never die
[18:18] but what the death is there
[18:20] is not what we call death like when
[18:22] jesus
[18:23] spoke about lazarus he said he sleepeth
[18:26] and they said well we are he does well
[18:30] if he sleeps then jesus said tell him in
[18:31] the language they knew
[18:33] see he's dead he said and for your sake
[18:35] i'm glad it wasn't there
[18:36] but i go waking and that's when he made
[18:39] that wonderful
[18:40] quotation that we have in the scripture
[18:42] he that
[18:43] he earth he that believeth on me has
[18:46] everlasting life shall not come into the
[18:48] judgment but
[18:49] pass from death unto life i am the
[18:52] resurrection in life
[18:53] he that believeth in me though he were
[18:55] dead yet shall he live
[18:57] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[19:00] shall never die
[19:01] they never die there's no there's really
[19:04] no death to a christian
[19:06] he death means eternal separation
[19:10] and now as when we are die like in the
[19:13] physical body as we are now we are
[19:15] separated from one another but
[19:18] it's really this body is the only thing
[19:20] that identifies us to each other
[19:23] because we are bound in five senses see
[19:26] taste feel smelling here
[19:27] and as long as we can see or feel one
[19:30] another
[19:30] while we have evidence that we're here
[19:33] if you're blind and can
[19:34] and and can't see then you can feel at
[19:37] one another and we are here
[19:39] one another and their earthly senses
[19:41] declare one another
[19:42] but really frankly we have never seen
[19:45] each other
[19:46] did you know that we have never seen one
[19:49] another
[19:49] you hear something speaking out of a
[19:51] body here that
[19:53] impersonates whatever it's on the inside
[19:55] so then when we talk to each other
[19:57] we're we're really not talking to the
[19:59] body it's the spirit inside but the body
[20:02] is the thing that identifies
[20:04] the spirit that's on the inside and
[20:06] therefore when we speak to each other
[20:08] we are quickly can understand right away
[20:10] whether we are christians or not because
[20:12] there's a fellowship
[20:13] in the spirit that we talk from you see
[20:15] that it vibrates to one another
[20:17] that whether we are christians or not
[20:19] therefore we have never seen each other
[20:22] jesus no man has seen god at any time
[20:26] but the only begotten of the father has
[20:29] declared him
[20:30] see in other words god was identified
[20:33] the
[20:34] the person of god was identified in the
[20:37] body
[20:37] the lord jesus christ so he was the
[20:40] express
[20:40] image of god or god expressing himself
[20:43] through an
[20:44] image thing through an image man god
[20:47] expressed himself to us and he
[20:49] was god not a third person or second
[20:52] person
[20:53] he was the person god he was god himself
[20:56] uh identifying himself so we could feel
[20:59] him
[21:00] well first timothy 3 16 without
[21:03] controversy that's argument
[21:04] great is the mystery of godliness for
[21:06] god was manifested
[21:08] or made known in the flesh that
[21:10] wonderful
[21:11] god and we could never understand god as
[21:14] he moved through a pillar of fire
[21:16] and so forth as he did but we
[21:20] understood him when he become one of us
[21:22] i think when he become
[21:23] man then he could talk to us and we
[21:26] could feel him handling touching
[21:28] and everything in as the scripture
[21:29] plainly says that we have handled god
[21:32] see with our hands touched him with our
[21:34] hands
[21:35] god is in man and he's identifying
[21:38] himself today
[21:40] in his church in the born-again
[21:42] christian
[21:43] god identifies himself that he remains
[21:46] god and the outside world will only know
[21:50] god
[21:51] as they see god and you and i that's the
[21:54] only way they'll know god
[21:55] is when we are written epistles epistle
[21:58] of the scripture we are read of all man
[22:01] and the life that we live
[22:03] reflects what's on the inside of us a
[22:05] man is identified by the works that he
[22:07] does
[22:08] so our work should be good see always
[22:11] good because
[22:12] we are representing our lord jesus
[22:15] christ
[22:16] what a wonderful thing that is
[22:18] especially when a
[22:19] an old man like me stand here and think
[22:22] of
[22:24] the life that is fading away that's gone
[22:27] in the past and
[22:28] and we're facing a future of an eternity
[22:33] and knowing if this life only is what i
[22:35] had hopes in
[22:36] i would be a most miserable person this
[22:38] morning but knowing that this life
[22:41] has only been a shadow
[22:44] of what we have to to come it's a
[22:47] reflection because it cannot be
[22:49] the perfect thing that god made god
[22:51] doesn't make anything
[22:52] that perishes god is eternal
[22:55] and therefore this life that we now live
[22:58] in
[22:59] is only reflecting what is
[23:02] ahead of us the real one that cannot die
[23:04] the body that cannot perish
[23:06] the life that cannot be taken see and
[23:08] therefore
[23:10] the scriptures is right when it says
[23:12] that
[23:13] we have everlasting life we have eternal
[23:15] life we should
[23:16] never die see because you become when
[23:19] you're born again
[23:20] you become a part of god see
[23:23] you are forever for eternity
[23:27] never to fail you are part of god
[23:29] because you're his son
[23:31] now i might take another name and say my
[23:33] name is
[23:34] some other name i might take my mother's
[23:36] name harvey which would be the closest
[23:38] to me
[23:39] uh in the world my mother was a harvey
[23:42] and then i might take the name of harvey
[23:44] but still the blood would prove that i
[23:47] am abraham
[23:48] see because i'm part of my father and as
[23:51] long as i got blood in me i'll still be
[23:53] part of my father
[23:55] see that's right and when i'm born of
[23:57] the spirit of god
[23:58] i am a part of god that's all i am
[24:01] identified with him and he is
[24:04] my father then my life should reflect
[24:07] him as my
[24:08] life reflects my earthly father and the
[24:11] image that he was in
[24:12] uh they say i look a whole lot like my
[24:14] father so then therefore it's
[24:16] his image reflected in me and your
[24:19] father reflected in you and your parents
[24:21] and so
[24:21] god our father is reflected in us when
[24:24] we're born
[24:25] and and conformed here to his image now
[24:28] i started talking never get to my text
[24:30] so i was going to talk to you about
[24:32] [Music]
[24:33] i have always appreciated a house
[24:37] meeting
[24:37] cottage prayer meeting such as this more
[24:40] than
[24:40] and i guess people could think that i
[24:44] would
[24:45] because the finest meetings the finest
[24:48] times of fellowship
[24:50] is usually in a little cottage prayer
[24:52] meeting like this
[24:53] or i have felt the closest to god is
[24:56] when just a
[24:57] little handful of believers comes
[24:59] together and
[25:00] there we worship now this morning i
[25:03] suppose we sit here at 30 40 30 i guess
[25:06] or something like that
[25:07] counting the children i wouldn't know
[25:09] i'm not very good on
[25:10] on on counting the numbers just to look
[25:13] over a little a group of people cause
[25:14] these other rooms here you see that i
[25:16] don't see the people in them now
[25:20] but when we come together like this i
[25:23] feel that we get a closeness that we
[25:25] don't get
[25:26] when we're out in a great huge
[25:28] congregation we can express ourselves
[25:31] that's why this morning and i thought
[25:33] coming down here
[25:35] that i would speak to the congregation
[25:38] here this morning
[25:39] and to its lovely little pastor so glad
[25:42] to see many of my friends here strickers
[25:44] and
[25:44] all those that i haven't seen for some
[25:47] time
[25:47] and i would speak this morning to you
[25:51] my new year's message that i had planned
[25:54] for speaking next sunday uh afternoon
[25:58] at the phoenix meeting at the auditorium
[26:01] because in here i thought maybe they're
[26:04] making tapes out there of it
[26:06] that i maybe the holy spirit would give
[26:08] me a better
[26:10] thought here amongst just a bunch of
[26:12] believers than perhaps it would be
[26:14] at phoenix amongst uh you know where the
[26:17] belief and unbelief and
[26:18] superstitions and and everything's mixed
[26:21] together
[26:21] and then if the brethren and letting the
[26:23] tapes out
[26:24] it would be um it would be better to do
[26:27] it that way because
[26:28] you have a better tape from here i asked
[26:30] the boys to check the acoustics first
[26:33] and when i come in this morning brother
[26:35] terry told me that
[26:37] the acoustics were fine so that's that's
[26:39] good
[26:40] so now uh let us first before we
[26:43] approach
[26:44] this solemn affair and i know i believe
[26:47] they said
[26:47] some of you are staying for lunch you
[26:49] got to have lunch here on the ground or
[26:52] at the house or something together
[26:53] that's very fine i just sure appreciate
[26:56] uh seeing you all get together i feel
[26:59] that
[27:00] that my message this morning is
[27:02] addressed to the church of the living
[27:04] god see
[27:05] and that which i believe this is a
[27:07] portion of it sitting here this morning
[27:09] and now before we come to the that
[27:11] solemn part
[27:12] let's bow our heads just a moment for
[27:14] prayer
[27:15] [Music]
[27:18] our heavenly father we are
[27:21] so grateful to you that we can even
[27:24] be privileged to address you as our
[27:27] father
[27:28] for a father means that
[27:32] we have been begotten of the great
[27:35] god that created the heavens and earth
[27:39] and we are so happy for this privilege
[27:41] that we can think in our hearts
[27:44] and then that we are sons and daughters
[27:46] of yours
[27:48] and then to see you strictly identify
[27:50] yourself in the midst of us that you
[27:52] are our father changing our thoughts
[27:56] from the things of the world and
[27:58] changing our emoties and objectives and
[28:01] attitudes and every phase of us
[28:05] to love you and to believe you and
[28:08] and know that your promises are true we
[28:11] have a symbol here
[28:12] this morning in this place that we call
[28:16] the back side of the desert or i call it
[28:19] that
[28:20] thinking it reason i say that lord is
[28:23] not
[28:24] to reflect anything upon this little
[28:26] group of people but
[28:28] of anything that would be of a nature of
[28:30] being
[28:31] small but i'm trying to think
[28:34] that it was moses your servant was at
[28:37] the backside of the desert
[28:39] maybe just he and his sheep
[28:43] maybe his wife zepra and uh
[28:46] gershom his son might have been along
[28:49] that i
[28:50] do not know but it was there that they
[28:53] had an experience
[28:54] that changed that profit from a runaway
[28:58] coward to the service of the god who had
[29:02] ordained him for the job
[29:04] on the backside of the desert it was
[29:07] there that
[29:08] that the pillar of fire that was made
[29:10] manifest for the first
[29:12] time in human life that we know of that
[29:15] fire was laying back in a little desert
[29:18] bush and it burnt not
[29:22] but it was a glory of god reflecting
[29:24] itself through that bush
[29:26] that moses the prophet taken off his
[29:28] shoes drawed nigh
[29:30] unto it and was commissioned by god to
[29:34] deliver
[29:34] a nation of god's people
[29:38] may it be so again today lord on the
[29:40] backside of the desert that we
[29:42] now take off as it was our shoes
[29:45] our hats are all and lay it down beneath
[29:50] the cross
[29:51] of christ and say here am i lord send me
[29:56] bless this pastor here our brother
[29:58] isaacson
[29:59] brother we pray that you bless him and
[30:02] his wife and his
[30:03] little ones brother stricker
[30:07] his wife and little ones and all the
[30:09] others that's represented here this
[30:11] morning
[30:12] and we've assembled here in the lord not
[30:14] for some
[30:15] great glory or to be
[30:18] known as leaders or
[30:22] or some an official of something great
[30:24] we are
[30:25] we are just here as humble believers
[30:28] we're here
[30:29] because we love you and we love one
[30:32] another
[30:33] and as we see each other and as we
[30:35] congregate together
[30:36] we find that it seems to be more of god
[30:39] gathers together as each believer
[30:41] assembles himself in us one certain
[30:44] place
[30:45] jesus said if you'll do this in my name
[30:48] then i'll be in your midst
[30:50] and we know that you're here speak to us
[30:52] lord
[30:53] and if these little note that i got
[30:55] wrote out your scriptures to refer to
[30:58] is off of the path this morning of the
[31:00] thought that you'd have us to think then
[31:02] lord
[31:03] we'll just omit that and do as you tell
[31:05] us to do
[31:07] bless us now for we ask this in jesus
[31:10] christ's name
[31:11] amen now
[31:15] in the reading of the scripture it used
[31:18] to be that i'm
[31:19] before i got so much age on me that i
[31:23] could
[31:24] remember good and in them days on
[31:28] young days i didn't take the long
[31:30] message maybe 30 minutes or something i
[31:32] plowed right into one thought and kept
[31:34] it on my mind
[31:35] but now i reason i hold these long
[31:38] meetings now is because i'm taping
[31:42] and this tape the boys they're taking it
[31:45] will
[31:45] start it at a certain time perhaps now
[31:47] at the beginning of the prayer
[31:50] and it goes many many places around the
[31:53] world
[31:54] so we are now going to speak this
[31:57] morning on my
[31:58] new years what would call my new year's
[32:01] message
[32:02] i tried had three christmas messages
[32:05] and i know you people down here at the
[32:08] back of the desert
[32:09] gets those tapes and on my on my last
[32:12] message up at the church
[32:14] or next to my last message was on the
[32:16] light
[32:18] and uh if you haven't got that tape i'm
[32:20] sure you'll enjoy it
[32:21] i enjoyed it very much the inspiration
[32:23] of it
[32:24] uh the lord gave me now
[32:28] today as we face new years i
[32:31] i want to think of
[32:35] not like the past but i
[32:38] want to look to the future as paul said
[32:42] for getting those things that are in the
[32:44] past
[32:45] i pressed towards the mark of the high
[32:47] calling
[32:49] and as it's expressed like looking back
[32:51] through the mayor of a car
[32:54] we are looking what we have passed when
[32:56] we're looking
[32:57] in the rear view mirror now we're not
[32:59] trying to place a message today
[33:01] as looking through a rear view mirror it
[33:04] would take too long
[33:06] see the things that the lord has did and
[33:08] you're all acquainted with the great
[33:10] uh things that our lord has been doing
[33:13] is some of the
[33:14] mightiest things that i've ever seen in
[33:16] my life he's just just passing in the
[33:18] last few months and but now
[33:22] we are thankful for what has been but
[33:24] now we're
[33:25] looking forward we're looking at where
[33:27] we're headed for
[33:29] and into this 1964. and now
[33:32] if you here like to read or or
[33:35] i'd like to read some scriptures because
[33:37] all this is based upon
[33:39] god's holy word and uh leaves me now
[33:42] about an hour and 15 minutes for this
[33:45] tape
[33:46] lord willing i'll try to get out so you
[33:47] can have your dinner i thank you for
[33:49] telling me
[33:50] that i had till six o'clock tonight that
[33:52] was very nice
[33:53] now let's turn in the bible to two
[33:56] places
[33:57] the books lay close together it's in the
[33:59] old testament i'll take the text
[34:02] or the reading from two places isaiah 62
[34:07] and psalms 60. in isaiah
[34:11] 62 we will turn to read first
[34:14] and in this we are
[34:17] a minded
[34:21] uh of the great
[34:24] powers of our lord a god
[34:28] and how how great he is and how mighty
[34:32] our god is i am sorry it's isaiah
[34:35] 60 instead of 62 isaiah
[34:38] 60. all right now
[34:41] we read this isaiah 60
[34:44] 1 and 2. arise
[34:47] and shine for the light is come
[34:50] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[34:54] thee for behold
[34:57] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[34:59] darkness the people but the lord shall
[35:02] rise upon thee
[35:04] and his glory shall be seen upon
[35:08] thee gross darkness upon the people
[35:12] of this of course this is a prophesying
[35:14] of the day that we're
[35:16] now living now let us turn in
[35:19] to psalms i believe that i may be
[35:22] a little confused where i broke my
[35:25] scriptures down here
[35:26] when a in a hurry uh last night
[35:29] in writing them writing out this uh
[35:33] psalms 62 1-8
[35:37] truly my soul waiteth upon god
[35:43] from him cometh my salvation
[35:46] he only is my rock and my
[35:49] salvation he is my defense
[35:52] i shall not be greatly moved
[35:56] how long will ye imagine mischief
[35:58] against a man
[36:00] you shall be slain of all
[36:03] of you as a
[36:06] vine wall shall be and as a tottering
[36:10] fence
[36:11] they only consult to cast him down
[36:15] from the excess lead they delight in
[36:18] lies
[36:18] they bless their with their mouth but
[36:21] their
[36:22] curse inwardly see like
[36:25] my soul wait thou only upon
[36:28] god for my expectations
[36:32] is from him he only is my rock and my
[36:36] salvation
[36:36] he is my defense i shall not be
[36:40] moved and god is my salvation
[36:43] and my glory the rock of my strength
[36:47] and my refuge is in god
[36:51] trust in him all the times
[36:55] ye people pour out your hearts before
[36:58] him
[36:59] god is a refuge for us
[37:03] sealant now
[37:07] if you noticed in the scripture reading
[37:08] there in the psalms
[37:11] it kept saying god is my rock
[37:15] you know what a rock represents in the
[37:17] bible
[37:18] a rock in the bible here represents the
[37:22] revelation
[37:23] of god see god is my
[37:26] revelation he is see the revelation
[37:30] of the word is the rock because
[37:34] peter one day when jesus had asked the
[37:37] question
[37:38] who does man say i the son of man am and
[37:40] one of them said
[37:41] you are some of them say you are moses
[37:44] or the
[37:45] elijah jeremiah one of the prophets
[37:48] but that wasn't the question who do you
[37:50] say i am he's
[37:51] peter spoke up these famous words and
[37:53] said the heart to christ
[37:55] the son of the living god he said
[37:56] blessed art thou simon son of jonas
[37:59] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[38:01] this to thee but my father which is in
[38:03] heaven
[38:04] and upon this rock see
[38:08] and david speaking here god is
[38:11] our rock god is our rock when god has
[38:15] been revealed to us
[38:17] that becomes a rock see god
[38:20] is our rock now
[38:24] my text for this morning is a
[38:28] odd word shalom
[38:32] shalom in the hebrew means
[38:36] peace and that's what i
[38:39] say to the church this morning shalom
[38:43] that's peace and finnish is called
[38:46] yamalan
[38:48] which means god's peace upon you
[38:52] raha god see god's
[38:55] peace shalom my new year's message is to
[38:59] the church
[39:00] elected in jesus christ
[39:04] for 19 and 64. not uh
[39:07] not just the church groups but the
[39:10] elect the lady
[39:14] the lady of of the church
[39:18] christ bride see that's who i'm
[39:21] addressing
[39:23] we're facing here in our two
[39:27] subjects that we read the two scriptures
[39:29] rather
[39:30] a very contrast
[39:33] one to the other in isaiah it says
[39:37] rise and shine for the glory of god
[39:42] has come upon you the light is here
[39:46] and then the very next verse he says
[39:48] gross darkness is upon this
[39:50] people and then when we are in a
[39:54] mystery of light and darkness
[39:57] and then my address to the church
[40:02] is shalom peace
[40:05] let's find out what's all about see
[40:09] we are facing this year with both
[40:11] darkness
[40:12] and light we are
[40:15] the world is in one of the most chaotic
[40:18] times
[40:19] of darkness that it's ever stood in
[40:23] and yet it's standing in again the most
[40:26] blessed light that ever shine in
[40:30] and there is uh
[40:34] the difference is just like it was in
[40:37] the beginning
[40:39] when there was gross darkness upon the
[40:42] earth and the spirit of god moved upon
[40:44] the face of water and said
[40:45] let there be light and god
[40:49] separated the light from the darkness
[40:53] and i believe that we are now living in
[40:56] that hour
[40:57] again that when god is separating
[41:00] light from darkness and he's
[41:03] pressing it to the other side of the
[41:05] world that the light might be made
[41:07] manifest and we are
[41:11] then the church the reason i'd say
[41:14] shalom to them
[41:15] is because that it's god's peace that's
[41:18] what i
[41:19] want to bring to you this morning for
[41:21] the new years
[41:23] uh not looking back but we're looking
[41:25] forward to the breaking of a new day
[41:28] until there is something great laying
[41:32] ahead of us were the years has been the
[41:35] joy that we've looked forward to
[41:37] the pressing coming of the great light
[41:40] and now
[41:41] we can see it breaking over the
[41:43] horizontal
[41:44] horizontal rim but breaking between
[41:48] marvel and immortality we see it
[41:51] breaking between
[41:52] uh heavens and earth from an earth-bound
[41:56] sickness and troubled world into a
[41:59] bright shining day of an immortal
[42:02] life and an immortal body and an
[42:05] immortal earth that should never pass
[42:07] away
[42:08] it's it's shalom until the unto the
[42:11] church
[42:13] now it's like time
[42:16] coming for the believers but a gross
[42:19] darkness for the people
[42:22] i uh the other day uh
[42:26] we was talking a wife and i and uh we
[42:30] were talking about
[42:31] the the hour that we're living in uh
[42:34] the reason i chose this place i felt
[42:37] like i could just let out and talk to
[42:39] you see anything
[42:40] it's um there seems to be a time that's
[42:44] upon the people that it's the most
[42:46] pathetic time that i
[42:48] could think about i have constantly
[42:52] done my very best to try to in
[42:55] disagreeing with
[42:56] man in religious terms but if i couldn't
[42:58] take his hand
[42:59] afterwards no matter how sharp the thing
[43:01] might be
[43:02] and take hold his hands and say this
[43:05] is in the light of a better
[43:09] understanding between us
[43:11] and still love the person not just say
[43:14] it from a list but from my heart
[43:16] then i'm no no subject at all to go out
[43:19] there and to
[43:20] try to talk to people because see we
[43:22] must do that we must love the person and
[43:26] going amongst the people in all kinds of
[43:28] classes and
[43:30] different cults and clans and religions
[43:32] and so forth
[43:33] and trying to lay the bible down and
[43:36] say let's let's discuss it not from your
[43:38] creed or from your book of ethics
[43:40] but from the bible
[43:44] and then not maybe sometime man get up
[43:47] real sharp
[43:48] but if i got one thought that i uh
[43:51] didn't like that person then then the i
[43:54] know one thing the spirit of christ has
[43:56] departed from me
[43:57] if i if i can feel that i don't like
[44:00] that person
[44:01] there's something wrong with me because
[44:03] the spirit of christ
[44:05] when they uh the and at crucifying him
[44:10] and uh his own people driving the nails
[44:12] and
[44:13] and his very creations he created was
[44:16] putting the nails that he created
[44:17] back into his human flesh and yet with a
[44:20] heart full of love he cried father
[44:23] forgive them
[44:25] they don't know what they're doing you
[44:26] see and i i've come to that spot
[44:30] i believe that people don't know what
[44:31] they're doing
[44:34] it comes to the time to where uh the
[44:36] human being
[44:38] has looked like become such a subject of
[44:41] evil
[44:43] uh until it's a pathetic thing it seems
[44:46] like there
[44:46] there's a shadow of darkness just over
[44:48] the people that presses him
[44:51] like for instance this one thing
[44:52] crossing the nation around and speaking
[44:55] in the lord god
[44:56] identifying and vindicating his word and
[44:59] showing that's exactly and never let
[45:01] nothing be said unless it comes to pass
[45:03] exactly what he said
[45:04] speaking it right into existence and so
[45:06] forth as he's been doing
[45:08] and people sit and look at that and
[45:10] continue right
[45:11] on in their same condition
[45:17] see um uh not any disregarding but
[45:20] i like our sisters many times with i
[45:23] speak to them about wearing those
[45:24] clothes and
[45:25] cutting their hair in little things and
[45:27] man how they'll continue on into their
[45:29] creeds and
[45:30] and serve under those creeds and things
[45:32] and and they're good people
[45:34] they're fine people but yet it seems
[45:37] like that
[45:38] they they can't understand look like
[45:40] they can't get it
[45:43] why i'll go back the next year and
[45:45] instead of being any better it's worse
[45:49] it continues on here's a sister once had
[45:52] lovely long hair she
[45:53] cut it off here's a man that once looked
[45:56] like he took
[45:56] his stand and went out for the thing was
[45:58] right he's right back in the
[46:00] like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its
[46:03] wallers and
[46:04] goes right back out and it it seems like
[46:06] there's something
[46:07] that has struck our people that struck
[46:10] the world
[46:12] that they don't seem to have the the
[46:14] understanding or something's wrong
[46:18] uh just like you notice
[46:21] man today you don't find that
[46:24] genuineness in man you don't find it in
[46:27] women
[46:28] now i'm not talking about i reason i'm
[46:31] basing this is get the shalom
[46:33] see but you notice the women
[46:36] in our day they don't seem to have that
[46:40] lady like uh they once had
[46:44] they're it looks like they want to but
[46:46] there's something won't let them do it
[46:48] it seems like there's a heaviness that
[46:50] you tell a lady that
[46:52] she should not do such and such a thing
[46:54] and the lady looks upon that and
[46:56] believes that
[46:57] she wants to believe that but there's
[46:59] something that presses her the other way
[47:03] poor thing i i feel sorry for her
[47:06] she's so caught in such a web
[47:10] of hollywood and the advertisements and
[47:15] television radio newspaper on the street
[47:18] in the store windows with modern dress
[47:21] and so forth
[47:22] and the way that other women need her
[47:25] and
[47:25] it seems to be that there is something
[47:28] that they just can't pull away from
[47:33] our young people our old people our
[47:35] middle age
[47:36] there seems to be something among man
[47:40] uh man don't seem to be have that
[47:43] uh masculine touch
[47:47] that he used to have women don't have
[47:50] that
[47:51] feminist touch she used to have
[47:55] you take man today man don't seem to be
[47:58] burly like they used to be it's all some
[48:01] sort of
[48:02] they want to wear uh suede shoes with
[48:05] purple and
[48:06] and uh they want to uh act like women
[48:11] amen now that is true
[48:14] it seems to be more or less like a
[48:17] perversion
[48:19] woman wants to cut off her hair and act
[48:22] like a man
[48:24] and a man wants to act like a woman see
[48:28] and yet you can talk to them and they're
[48:31] nice people to talk to nice people
[48:35] friendly sociable people what's caused
[48:39] this
[48:40] it's that gross darkness
[48:44] upon the people it's something that
[48:46] expressed them into it
[48:48] [Music]
[48:49] like the jews was in the days that jesus
[48:52] came to the earth
[48:54] isaiah had prophesied of it and said
[48:57] there
[48:58] would be they would have eyes but
[49:00] couldn't see and
[49:02] ears and couldn't hear and that's the
[49:05] reason jesus prayed their forgiveness
[49:08] because it had to be that way to fulfill
[49:10] the scripture
[49:12] and it's returned again to us
[49:15] the bible has spoken this day that we
[49:17] live
[49:19] and said these things have come
[49:22] gross darkness upon the people and we
[49:25] see it
[49:26] that there's something that just simply
[49:29] the people want to but they can't
[49:32] nicodemus expressed it one time before
[49:34] the lord
[49:35] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[49:38] come from god
[49:39] or no man could do the things that you
[49:42] do
[49:42] if god wasn't with him but it was that
[49:46] darkness or blindness
[49:49] upon the jewish race that the messiah
[49:53] might come to take from the gentiles
[49:56] abroad they had to reject him and that's
[49:59] the gross
[50:00] darkness that's upon the churches and
[50:02] things today
[50:04] to fail to see the light that shines
[50:10] see there seems to be such a heavy press
[50:14] we take the some of the noted
[50:15] evangelists today they
[50:17] are constantly screaming for a revival
[50:19] and working right against it
[50:21] amen not understanding
[50:25] without understanding and i don't
[50:28] say that in the the
[50:32] motive of trying to say now uh we've
[50:35] seen this and
[50:36] glory to god they're not in it i'm not
[50:39] trying to just say that in the
[50:41] uh to get people to think well brother
[50:42] branham you you got the only truth there
[50:44] is in the world no that is wrong
[50:46] see i'm only saying it in the light of
[50:49] the hour that we're walking in and for
[50:52] the benefit of people who are trying to
[50:54] seek this life
[50:55] truly jesus said no man can come to me
[50:58] except my father draws him
[50:59] no man will never see it it's that
[51:01] predestinated seed and that only is
[51:03] going to receive it
[51:06] but we come to that place again the
[51:09] bible said that you're the light of the
[51:11] world
[51:13] the prophet said gross darkness upon the
[51:16] people
[51:16] upon the people of the world at this
[51:18] time and that's exactly what we've got
[51:20] gross darkness upon the people
[51:24] god in his great mercy as i have always
[51:28] preached and tried to stand for that he
[51:31] always shows is his
[51:34] events from heaven as great major events
[51:38] happens in heaven before it happens on
[51:41] earth
[51:43] he reflects himself in other words
[51:46] before messiah
[51:48] uh came into a place where his ministry
[51:51] would start
[51:52] there came forth a star
[51:56] out of heaven that guided
[51:59] the man uh to the the
[52:02] the place where he was the wise man as
[52:05] you heard in my last message how did
[52:08] god dealt with the wise man and then in
[52:11] the day that
[52:12] he he turned him aside by a dream and he
[52:16] told joseph by a dream how to take care
[52:18] of the welfare of his own son
[52:20] because he had the dream there was a
[52:22] dream is secondarily something
[52:24] off to one side because people can have
[52:26] dreams that's not right
[52:28] but there was no prophet in the land in
[52:29] that day there was no prophet
[52:32] therefore god had to use what he had to
[52:33] use with and it
[52:35] teaches us that god can use every
[52:37] faculty and everything that we do if
[52:39] it's consecrated to him
[52:41] but it first must be consecrated to him
[52:43] let your your meditations
[52:46] which really reflects your dream because
[52:48] it's your subconscious
[52:50] if you watch a dream you'll see that
[52:51] something you've been thinking of or
[52:52] something like that usually you see
[52:54] and let your mind be on god then see it
[52:57] so it reflects something for him and
[52:59] whatever you are
[53:00] let it reflect him now
[53:04] in the heavens above did you notice i'm
[53:07] looking on this
[53:08] of the um the light on the picture there
[53:12] out of the life magazine that
[53:14] uh the brother lives here in his home
[53:16] has uh
[53:17] uh put on his wall
[53:21] uh that triangle of light
[53:25] i just have to run across my mind if any
[53:28] of you has
[53:29] the lumza bible translation if you'll
[53:32] notice over the cover of it
[53:34] is a triune trinitarian
[53:37] light a three-cornered light like a halo
[53:42] and um when dr lomza a
[53:45] friend my personal friend was
[53:47] translating the bible that
[53:48] is the old hebrew symbol
[53:52] of god in the true trinitarian
[53:56] way that he is not three gods
[53:59] but three manifestations of the same
[54:03] god father son and holy spirit the light
[54:06] is one complete circle of light
[54:10] in a triangle shape which means that god
[54:13] will dwell in three offices
[54:15] the fatherhood sonship and holy ghost
[54:17] dispensation
[54:18] all the same god
[54:21] but did you notice before the seven
[54:24] seals
[54:25] was revealed before the great mysterious
[54:29] light showed forth in the heavens
[54:32] uh up here at above tucson
[54:36] flagstaff where we were brother fred two
[54:39] of the man that was
[54:40] the two man was with me that morning on
[54:43] that we've been told months and months
[54:44] ahead of time what happened
[54:46] both brother fred uh sophman and brother
[54:48] gene norman sitting here this morning
[54:50] when it
[54:50] was there when the blast went off and
[54:53] not knowing these things would take
[54:55] place
[54:56] and he sent me back said that the time
[54:58] was at hand for these
[55:00] seven seals which held the seven
[55:02] mysteries
[55:04] of the entire bible was sealed in with
[55:07] these seven seals
[55:08] and how these angels down along the road
[55:11] of messengers and the church ages opened
[55:14] to a certain part of that
[55:15] but in the seventh hour the seventh
[55:19] messenger that all these mysteries
[55:23] should be finished
[55:26] the seventh earthly messenger see this
[55:29] angel that he speaks of then was on
[55:31] earth uh angel means messenger
[55:33] and then after that he saw another angel
[55:36] coming down not the earthly
[55:38] angel that had been given the message
[55:40] here but the
[55:41] uh another mighty angel came from heaven
[55:44] with a rainbow
[55:45] over him and set his foot on the land
[55:48] and see
[55:49] and swore by him that lives forever and
[55:50] ever time shall be no more
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] but before he broke forth on those seven
[55:57] seals to reveal him
[55:59] that he sowed miraculously he showed it
[56:01] first in the heavens
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:05] that day they took pictures all across
[56:07] southern united states and mexico
[56:09] there it hangs down the life magazine
[56:10] still a mystery to them
[56:13] but he declares it in the heavens
[56:17] before he does it on earth
[56:22] he always does that he shows his signs
[56:25] in the heavens first and even
[56:28] in the zodiac i'm not going back to
[56:31] teach
[56:32] zodiac but i'm just showing you the
[56:33] heavens declare it
[56:36] in the zodiac we find out in the
[56:38] constellations of the stars
[56:40] that he declared the whole bible
[56:44] in the constellation of the zodiac
[56:47] we find out there that he starts off the
[56:50] ver very first figure
[56:52] in the zodiac is the virgin
[56:57] and the last figure in the zodiac is leo
[57:00] the line
[57:02] showing that jesus would come first to
[57:04] the earth by
[57:06] a virgin you'll come the second time as
[57:09] a lion of the tribe of judah
[57:12] he goes through the cross fishes just
[57:14] before that cancer age
[57:16] what we're living in now
[57:20] all the heavens declaring him the bible
[57:22] says
[57:24] now a few months ago
[57:27] i preached for a series of meetings at
[57:31] the tabernacle on the seven
[57:33] church ages you perhaps all have heard
[57:35] them
[57:37] and when i finished drawing out on the
[57:40] blackboard
[57:41] the seven church ages how the light come
[57:44] in and how the light went out
[57:48] and i guess you have that perhaps here
[57:50] somewhere but it's among us anyhow we
[57:52] know
[57:54] the strange thing on the last day when
[57:56] the last
[57:58] church age was drawn out this great
[58:00] pillar of fire
[58:02] which is among us came down
[58:06] among hundreds of people and tuck itself
[58:09] back to the back wall of the tabernacle
[58:11] and there before these hundreds
[58:13] dropped those church ages darkening and
[58:15] lightning just exactly the way i had to
[58:17] draw it on the board
[58:20] mysteriously
[58:22] now the other day we've had
[58:25] in the event of the history of the
[58:28] church sound
[58:30] in the the bible the moon represents
[58:33] the church and the
[58:37] sun represents christ
[58:41] or we find that in revelations the 12th
[58:43] chapter
[58:44] the woman which was the church she was
[58:46] found
[58:47] with the moon under her feet and the sun
[58:50] at her head
[58:51] 12 stars in her crown which the the
[58:55] old orthodox jewish
[58:58] law was under her feet she crossed over
[59:01] that into the light of the sun
[59:04] twelve stars were the twelve apostles
[59:06] that brought the messages to us
[59:08] now under the holy spirit now we find
[59:12] that the moon in the heavens is to
[59:15] reflect
[59:16] the light of the sun in the absence of
[59:19] the sun
[59:21] it gives us it gives us light to get
[59:23] around
[59:25] but it's still no matter how much it
[59:27] reflects it's still not the perfect
[59:28] light because
[59:30] it is reflecting amen
[59:34] and the sun shines against the moon
[59:37] and the moon reflects its light in the
[59:39] absence of the sun but when the sun
[59:41] comes up then the moon is not needed no
[59:43] more
[59:44] amen and today the church
[59:47] is reflecting the light of the absent
[59:50] son
[59:50] of god the church is a reflection
[59:53] of the light because he said a little
[59:56] while and the world seeth me no more yet
[59:58] ye shall see me
[1:00:00] for i will be with you even in you to
[1:00:03] the end of the age
[1:00:04] the works that i do relights that he
[1:00:06] made manifest and there's no
[1:00:08] light except through the word of god
[1:00:12] there was that sun is the word of god in
[1:00:14] the beginning god said
[1:00:16] let there be light and when the
[1:00:20] manifested word of god when the word of
[1:00:23] god was
[1:00:24] manifested there was life first god
[1:00:28] spoke it what if it didn't manifest
[1:00:30] then it wasn't light yet but when he
[1:00:32] spoke it and then it was
[1:00:34] manifested vindicated his word was a
[1:00:36] vindicated
[1:00:37] light come into existence that's the
[1:00:39] only way it can be done now
[1:00:41] it's when the word is vindicated god's
[1:00:44] written word a vindicated then it shows
[1:00:47] light
[1:00:48] it's a portion is lip are put out for
[1:00:51] each age we found in the church ages we
[1:00:53] find in the old
[1:00:54] the old testament church ages each time
[1:00:57] that there come a time for
[1:00:59] a a certain manifestation of the journey
[1:01:02] there was a prophet came to the earth
[1:01:04] and the word came to the prophet and he
[1:01:06] made that word live
[1:01:08] and when that word was identified it
[1:01:10] reflected god
[1:01:12] and there was the the age there was a
[1:01:16] light
[1:01:16] that's way light comes today that's a
[1:01:20] good start friends
[1:01:22] amen i didn't want to go further because
[1:01:23] there's some things i'd like to talk
[1:01:25] about
[1:01:26] while we're here so first we'll go
[1:01:28] through our questions
[1:01:29] and then there's some other things that
[1:01:31] we want to talk about
[1:01:33] all right let's look at our first
[1:01:34] question what is a rock in scripture
[1:01:40] this is wonderful because once you once
[1:01:42] you iron this out
[1:01:43] when you read the scriptures everything
[1:01:45] comes alive
[1:01:47] once you understand what the symbology
[1:01:50] here means
[1:01:50] everything comes alive so let's turn to
[1:01:53] paragraph
[1:01:54] 32. what is a rock in scripture and
[1:01:58] let's look at paragraph 32
[1:02:00] and we'll we'll just refresh here just
[1:02:02] above that he reads out of psalm 62
[1:02:04] verse one day
[1:02:05] truly my soul waiteth upon god from him
[1:02:08] cometh my salvation
[1:02:09] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:02:12] is my defense
[1:02:13] i shall i shall not be greatly moved you
[1:02:16] skip down a few verses it says my soul
[1:02:18] wait thou only upon god for my
[1:02:20] expectation is from him
[1:02:22] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:02:24] is my defense
[1:02:25] i shall not be moved and god is my
[1:02:28] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[1:02:30] strength and my refuge is in god
[1:02:33] trust in him at all times you people
[1:02:36] pour out your hearts before him god is a
[1:02:37] refuge for us
[1:02:39] sila so god is the rock he's the
[1:02:41] salvation he's the refuge
[1:02:43] and what is that rock in paragraph 32
[1:02:46] now if you notice in the scripture
[1:02:47] reading here in the psalms it keeps
[1:02:49] saying
[1:02:50] god is my rock do you know what a rock
[1:02:52] represents in the bible
[1:02:53] a rock in the bible here represents the
[1:02:55] revelation of god see
[1:02:57] god is my revelation he is see the
[1:03:00] revelation of the word
[1:03:01] is the rock so the revelation of the
[1:03:04] word
[1:03:05] what word the revelation of the word for
[1:03:07] our day
[1:03:08] the revelation of the word for our day
[1:03:11] is the rock
[1:03:12] is our salvation is our refuge is our
[1:03:15] fortress
[1:03:16] is our strong tower is everything to us
[1:03:19] it is our defense it's the thing that
[1:03:21] defends us it's the thing that protects
[1:03:22] us
[1:03:23] it's the thing that saves us it's the
[1:03:24] thing that keeps us is the revelation of
[1:03:27] the word in this
[1:03:28] hour so you can read that scripture and
[1:03:32] be like oh
[1:03:32] you know god was so wonderful over there
[1:03:35] and so wonderful over there
[1:03:36] no he is my rock he is my foundation he
[1:03:40] is my shelter he is my refuge he is my
[1:03:43] strength he is my protector
[1:03:45] what is he he's the word made manifest
[1:03:47] today
[1:03:49] amen let's keep reading verse 33 or
[1:03:51] paragraph 33 because peter
[1:03:53] one day when jesus had asked the
[1:03:55] question who does man say i the son of
[1:03:57] man am
[1:03:58] and one of them said there's some of
[1:03:59] them saying you're moses or elijah
[1:04:01] jeremiah one of the prophets but that
[1:04:03] wasn't the question
[1:04:04] who do you say i am oh that's the same
[1:04:07] question today
[1:04:08] what is this message christ
[1:04:13] the rock who do you say i am
[1:04:17] he peter spoke up these famous words and
[1:04:19] said thou art the christ the son of the
[1:04:21] living god
[1:04:22] he said blessed are thou simon son of
[1:04:24] jonas for flesh and blood has not
[1:04:25] revealed
[1:04:26] this to thee but my father which is in
[1:04:28] heaven and
[1:04:29] upon this rock see and david speaking
[1:04:31] here god is our rock
[1:04:33] god is our rock when god has been
[1:04:35] revealed to us
[1:04:37] that becomes a roxy god is
[1:04:40] our rock he's not our rock
[1:04:44] just because we say he's a rock when god
[1:04:46] has revealed to us he becomes our rock
[1:04:49] and god is revealed in his word
[1:04:52] what is shalom this is an easy one i
[1:04:54] think all of us knew it but i like the
[1:04:56] way brother branham says it
[1:04:57] in paragraph 38 down here we're right
[1:04:59] here with the next paragraph down
[1:05:02] he says now my text for this morning is
[1:05:04] an odd word shalom shalom in hebrew
[1:05:06] means peace
[1:05:07] and that's what i say to the church this
[1:05:09] morning shalom that's peace
[1:05:11] and finish it is whatever which means
[1:05:14] god's peace
[1:05:15] see god see god's peace shalom so it's
[1:05:18] not just peace brother brennan puts
[1:05:20] emphasis on god's peace
[1:05:22] amen it's not just saying peace to
[1:05:24] somebody that you can have peace but
[1:05:26] it's
[1:05:26] god's peace and that comes by revelation
[1:05:33] amen what is the effect of gross
[1:05:36] darkness
[1:05:37] brother benham actually gives the answer
[1:05:38] in paragraph 52 but i want to back up to
[1:05:41] paragraph 47
[1:05:42] and i want to read this but as i read
[1:05:45] this
[1:05:46] i want us to not think see
[1:05:49] there was there was times when when
[1:05:51] brother branham was here
[1:05:53] and the day that he was here there was
[1:05:55] no message churches
[1:05:57] all right you have branham tabernacle
[1:05:59] you had a couple little groups and there
[1:06:00] was different churches that
[1:06:02] that were in you know different
[1:06:04] persuasions of different thoughts and
[1:06:06] some followed after his ministry and
[1:06:08] something didn't and when brother
[1:06:09] branham is addressing things to the
[1:06:11] church
[1:06:11] he's really addressing a situation where
[1:06:14] there's not message churches
[1:06:15] but i don't want to leave it back there
[1:06:17] i'd like to bring it home
[1:06:19] i'd like to make it you know i don't
[1:06:21] want to push this out somewhere else
[1:06:23] but bring these thoughts home and and
[1:06:26] then let it let your own experience that
[1:06:28] you've had
[1:06:28] amen just let your own experience open
[1:06:32] our understanding
[1:06:34] what is the effect of gross darkness
[1:06:37] paragraph 47 i've come to that spot i
[1:06:40] believe that people don't know what
[1:06:41] they're doing
[1:06:43] it comes to the time where the human
[1:06:45] being look like becomes such a subject
[1:06:47] to evil until it's a pathetic thing
[1:06:49] it seems like there's a shadow of
[1:06:51] darkness just over the people that
[1:06:52] presses them
[1:06:54] now brother branham isn't uh he's
[1:06:57] talking about this press of darkness
[1:06:58] over people and he says it's pathetic
[1:07:01] it's pitiful brother man is showing pity
[1:07:03] he's showing concern
[1:07:05] he's not he's not yelling at the people
[1:07:08] he's not screaming that they're such
[1:07:10] horrible rotten people
[1:07:11] he's saying it's the condition of
[1:07:13] darkness around that has brought people
[1:07:15] into this condition
[1:07:16] and he's seeing it as a pathetic thing
[1:07:18] and he's showing uh
[1:07:19] he is he's being he's thinking
[1:07:21] pathetically he's thinking
[1:07:23] uh sincerely he's got empathy for the
[1:07:25] people
[1:07:26] because he knows it's the darkness
[1:07:28] there's the absence of word there's a
[1:07:30] famine in the land
[1:07:31] not a food or water but of hearing of
[1:07:32] the word
[1:07:35] so he goes 48 like for instance this one
[1:07:37] thing crossing the nation around
[1:07:39] speaking
[1:07:40] and the lord god identifying vindicating
[1:07:42] his word and showing
[1:07:43] that it's exactly and never let nothing
[1:07:46] be said unless it comes to pass
[1:07:47] exactly what he said speaking it right
[1:07:50] into existence and so forth as he's been
[1:07:52] doing
[1:07:52] and people sit and look at that and
[1:07:54] continue right on in their same
[1:07:56] condition
[1:07:58] see not any disregarding but like our
[1:08:00] sisters many times
[1:08:01] when i speak to them about wearing these
[1:08:03] clothes and cutting their hair little
[1:08:04] things and
[1:08:05] man how they'll continue on their creeds
[1:08:07] and serve under those creeds and things
[1:08:09] and
[1:08:09] they're good people they're fine people
[1:08:12] but yet it seems like
[1:08:13] they can't understand look like they
[1:08:15] can't get it
[1:08:17] brother man's not saying horrible people
[1:08:19] these are people that he likes
[1:08:21] fine people nice people friendly people
[1:08:24] good people
[1:08:25] but they can't understand look like they
[1:08:27] can't get it why i go back the next year
[1:08:29] and instead of being any better it's
[1:08:30] worse
[1:08:32] continues on here's a sister that once
[1:08:34] had lovely long hair she cut it off
[1:08:36] here's a man that once looked like he
[1:08:37] took a stand and went out for the thing
[1:08:39] was right
[1:08:40] he's right back in like a dog to its
[1:08:42] vomit and a hog to its wallow see
[1:08:44] goes right back out in it it seems like
[1:08:47] there's something that has struck our
[1:08:49] people
[1:08:49] it struck the world that they don't seem
[1:08:51] to have the understanding
[1:08:53] that there's something wrong just like
[1:08:56] you notice man today
[1:08:57] you don't find that genuineness in man
[1:08:59] you don't find it in women now
[1:09:01] i'm not talking about reason i'm basing
[1:09:02] this is to get to shalom see
[1:09:05] but you notice the women in our day they
[1:09:07] don't seem to have the lady like they
[1:09:08] once had
[1:09:10] they just like they want to but there's
[1:09:12] something won't let them do it
[1:09:14] it seems like there's something a
[1:09:16] heaviness
[1:09:17] now you tell a lady that she should not
[1:09:20] be in such a such a thing and the lady
[1:09:21] looks
[1:09:22] upon that and believes that she wants to
[1:09:24] believe that
[1:09:25] but there's something that presses her
[1:09:27] the other way
[1:09:28] see poor thing i feel sorry for her
[1:09:33] man's not angry at her he's not saying
[1:09:36] mean things about her
[1:09:38] he's understanding it's the dark
[1:09:40] condition of the world that's pressing
[1:09:42] down
[1:09:42] and she's a good woman and she wants to
[1:09:44] do right but it seems like there's
[1:09:46] something keeping her from it
[1:09:48] it's a good man but it seems like
[1:09:50] there's something keeping him
[1:09:51] see this is a great understanding for us
[1:09:55] to help us deal with people that's all
[1:09:57] around us family and friends and
[1:09:59] people in the church around us amen
[1:10:01] sometimes there's just a darkness that's
[1:10:02] such a press
[1:10:03] that god's got to click that light bulb
[1:10:05] on or nothing's going to change
[1:10:08] not people hear it they they they can
[1:10:10] even sit right among us amen
[1:10:12] here they want to do right i want to do
[1:10:14] it but it seems like there's something
[1:10:15] that just
[1:10:16] can't grasp it
[1:10:19] amen said i feel sorry for her
[1:10:23] she's so caught in such a web of
[1:10:25] hollywood
[1:10:27] bring this home don't fish this out
[1:10:29] somewhere else
[1:10:31] caught in such a way of hollywood and
[1:10:33] the advertisements in television radio
[1:10:35] newspaper on the street and in the store
[1:10:37] windows
[1:10:37] with modern dress and so forth and the
[1:10:39] way that other women meet her
[1:10:41] it seems to be that there's something
[1:10:42] that they just can't pull away from our
[1:10:45] young people our old people are middle
[1:10:46] age
[1:10:48] there seems to be something among men
[1:10:50] man don't seem to have that masculine
[1:10:51] touch that he used to have
[1:10:53] women don't have that feminist touch you
[1:10:55] used to have
[1:10:56] you take man today men don't seem to be
[1:10:58] burly like they used to be
[1:11:00] it's all some sort of they want to wear
[1:11:01] suede shoes with purple
[1:11:04] i like when he says that suede shoes
[1:11:07] with purple and
[1:11:08] they want to act like women now that is
[1:11:10] true it seems to be
[1:11:12] more or less like a perversion a woman
[1:11:14] wants to cut off her hair and act like a
[1:11:15] man
[1:11:16] a man wants to act like a woman and yet
[1:11:18] you can talk to them and they're nice
[1:11:20] people to talk to nice people
[1:11:22] friendly sociable people what's caused
[1:11:25] this
[1:11:25] it's that gross darkness upon the people
[1:11:28] it's something that's
[1:11:29] pressed them into it
[1:11:32] that's why we have to stay in the light
[1:11:35] because if we're not constantly in the
[1:11:37] light with the revelation of the hour
[1:11:39] that gross darkness will press on us and
[1:11:41] no matter how much we want to do right
[1:11:43] you'll feel a pressure keeping us from
[1:11:46] the right thing
[1:11:47] because something has to break that
[1:11:49] darkness before we can move to the right
[1:11:50] thing
[1:11:52] amen we're not we're not looking for a
[1:11:54] reformation we're looking for a
[1:11:56] transformation
[1:11:57] the light has got to strike the seed on
[1:11:59] the inside and break the gross darkness
[1:12:01] off
[1:12:01] because if not that gross darkness is
[1:12:03] going to keep pushing
[1:12:04] and pushing and pushing and you find
[1:12:07] right amongst believers people you love
[1:12:09] there's a greater separation taking
[1:12:11] place all the time
[1:12:14] right i'm not saying anything we're not
[1:12:16] aware of
[1:12:17] it seems right amongst people you love
[1:12:19] dearly right amongst believers there
[1:12:21] seems to be
[1:12:22] things are going two different
[1:12:24] directions
[1:12:26] and we've got to stay in the light as he
[1:12:28] is in the light
[1:12:29] and as he brings revelation we've got to
[1:12:31] stay in tune we've got to stay in
[1:12:33] harmony with what he's doing
[1:12:34] or else they find that darkness creeping
[1:12:36] back in
[1:12:38] we want to do right but that darkness is
[1:12:40] oppressing
[1:12:41] it seems like they can't do it
[1:12:44] we've been in that position i've been in
[1:12:46] that position
[1:12:48] but thank god he sends the light and he
[1:12:50] breaks the power of the gross darkness
[1:12:56] let's look over paragraph 56
[1:13:02] and that's the gross darkness that's
[1:13:03] upon the churches and things today
[1:13:05] to fail to see the light that's shining
[1:13:08] see there seems to be such a heavy press
[1:13:11] we take some of the noted evangelists
[1:13:12] today they are constantly screaming for
[1:13:14] a revival and working right against it
[1:13:16] see
[1:13:17] not understanding without understanding
[1:13:21] and brother brennan's not screaming at
[1:13:22] him horrible people
[1:13:24] hate those people he loves them and he
[1:13:26] says it's just
[1:13:27] i feel sorry it seems like it's a
[1:13:29] pitiful condition they just
[1:13:31] can't seem to understand not bad people
[1:13:35] not bad intentions not people he didn't
[1:13:37] love
[1:13:38] some of these were his friends but just
[1:13:41] can't seem to grasp him
[1:13:46] amen move to the next question question
[1:13:48] number four
[1:13:50] how is the invisible god manifested
[1:13:54] this is a good one let's go to paragraph
[1:13:57] five all the way back to paragraph five
[1:14:01] we're going to read paragraphs five
[1:14:02] through nine
[1:14:08] i want to back it up and grab the
[1:14:10] context of what he's saying
[1:14:12] because if you grab the context of what
[1:14:14] he's saying all the way through
[1:14:16] it becomes so powerful this is shocking
[1:14:19] what he's getting ready to say
[1:14:20] are you ready to be shocked
[1:14:26] now as when we are
[1:14:28] die like in the physical body as we are
[1:14:31] now we are
[1:14:32] separated from one another but it's
[1:14:34] really this body is the only thing that
[1:14:36] identifies us to each other
[1:14:38] because we are bound in five senses see
[1:14:40] taste feel smell in here
[1:14:42] and as long as we can see or feel one
[1:14:44] another we have
[1:14:45] evidence that we're here
[1:14:49] are you getting it
[1:14:52] the evidence that you're here is your
[1:14:54] body
[1:14:56] right brother is going to go on to say
[1:14:58] we have evidence that we're here
[1:14:59] if you're blind and can't see then you
[1:15:01] feel one another or hear one another
[1:15:03] and the earthly senses declare one
[1:15:05] another
[1:15:07] but really frankly we have never seen
[1:15:09] each other
[1:15:11] did you know that we have never seen one
[1:15:13] another you hear something speaking out
[1:15:15] of a body
[1:15:16] here that impersonates whatever's on the
[1:15:19] inside
[1:15:20] so then when we talk to each other we're
[1:15:23] really not talking to the body
[1:15:25] it's the spirit inside but the body is
[1:15:27] the thing that identifies the spirit
[1:15:29] that's on the inside
[1:15:31] you ever try to try to have a
[1:15:32] conversation with a dead man
[1:15:35] it's the same body it's the same
[1:15:38] elements
[1:15:38] but there's no conversation because
[1:15:40] you're not talking to the body
[1:15:42] you're talking to the life that's inside
[1:15:44] the body
[1:15:45] and if that life leaves the body you can
[1:15:47] keep talking to the same body
[1:15:49] but there's now no more conversation
[1:15:50] because you were never talking to the
[1:15:52] body
[1:15:53] the body was only a tent that the person
[1:15:55] was living in
[1:15:58] see this is the context brother branham
[1:15:59] is bringing to us so we understand
[1:16:02] the body is the thing that identifies
[1:16:04] the spirit that's on the inside
[1:16:06] and therefore when we speak to each
[1:16:08] other quickly can understand right away
[1:16:10] whether we're christians or not
[1:16:11] because there's a fellowship in the
[1:16:13] spirit that we talk from
[1:16:15] you see that it vibrates to one another
[1:16:17] whether we are christians or not
[1:16:19] therefore we have never seen each other
[1:16:23] jesus said no man has seen god at any
[1:16:25] time but the only begotten of the father
[1:16:27] has declared him
[1:16:28] he goes right from us not seeing each
[1:16:31] other
[1:16:32] right to jesus declaring the father
[1:16:36] no man has seen god at any time but the
[1:16:38] only begotten of the father declared him
[1:16:40] see
[1:16:40] in other words god was identified the
[1:16:43] person of god was identified in the body
[1:16:46] the lord jesus christ so he was the
[1:16:48] expressed image of god
[1:16:50] or god expressing himself through an
[1:16:52] image see through an image
[1:16:54] man god expressed himself to us
[1:16:57] and he was god not a third person or a
[1:17:00] second person
[1:17:01] he was the person god he was god himself
[1:17:05] identifying himself so we could feel him
[1:17:09] the body declares the life on the inside
[1:17:12] we've never talked to one another
[1:17:14] amen the body's declaring the inside
[1:17:16] you're talking to the spirit
[1:17:19] it goes right to jesus it was god on the
[1:17:21] inside declaring through the body of
[1:17:23] jesus
[1:17:24] so you could see so you could touch so
[1:17:26] you could feel a manifestation or a
[1:17:28] declaration of god not the second person
[1:17:31] not the third person but god himself
[1:17:33] in a man all right so that's how the
[1:17:36] invisible god is made manifest
[1:17:39] is in the flesh body of man then brother
[1:17:42] brenham goes on and says
[1:17:44] now first timothy 3 16 without
[1:17:46] controversy
[1:17:47] that's argument great is the mystery of
[1:17:49] godliness for god was manifested or made
[1:17:52] known
[1:17:53] in the flesh isn't that wonderful
[1:17:56] god how is god manifest in the flesh
[1:18:02] and we could never understand god as he
[1:18:04] moved through a pillar of fire and so
[1:18:06] forth
[1:18:06] as he did but we understand him when he
[1:18:08] become one of us
[1:18:10] see when he become man then he could
[1:18:12] talk to us
[1:18:13] he could feel him handle him touch him
[1:18:15] and everything and as the scripture
[1:18:17] plainly says that we have handled god
[1:18:19] see
[1:18:20] with our hands touched him with our
[1:18:22] hands god is in man
[1:18:24] and he's identified himself today in his
[1:18:27] church
[1:18:29] you catch the pattern god is identified
[1:18:33] in flesh
[1:18:34] amen he was identified fully in the
[1:18:36] flesh of jesus christ
[1:18:38] amen that flesh now has come served its
[1:18:40] purpose
[1:18:41] been the sacrifice died and resurrected
[1:18:44] but
[1:18:44] god is still the invisible god is still
[1:18:47] being made manifest upon the earth
[1:18:49] and he's being made manifest in flesh
[1:18:53] god is in man and he's identifying
[1:18:54] himself today in his
[1:18:56] church and the born-again christian god
[1:18:58] identifies
[1:18:59] himself that he remains god and the
[1:19:02] outside world will
[1:19:03] only know god as they see god and you
[1:19:06] and i
[1:19:09] that's the only way that they'll know
[1:19:11] god is when we are written epistles
[1:19:13] epistles of the scripture
[1:19:14] we are read of all men and the life that
[1:19:16] we live reflects what's on the
[1:19:18] inside of us what's on the inside of us
[1:19:22] it better be the life of god
[1:19:24] it better be a a a born-again
[1:19:27] regenerated seed gene of god
[1:19:30] living out and if it's an attribute of
[1:19:32] god made alive
[1:19:33] what is it it's god declaring himself
[1:19:36] through flesh
[1:19:38] not one body this time amen not one
[1:19:41] member
[1:19:41] not one body but many member bodies
[1:19:44] still one body
[1:19:45] but many members upon the earth the
[1:19:48] invisible god is still manifest
[1:19:50] in flesh in the flesh of his bride
[1:19:54] that's how the world will never see god
[1:19:56] brother brennan said unless they see god
[1:19:58] and you and i
[1:20:02] praise be to god that is powerful
[1:20:06] so when you when you answer that
[1:20:08] question you back up the context brother
[1:20:10] brenham's trying to get us
[1:20:11] to realize that you're not that this is
[1:20:14] body is only declaring the life on the
[1:20:16] inside
[1:20:17] now the question is what life is on the
[1:20:19] inside and if it's zoe life on the
[1:20:22] inside
[1:20:22] then this flesh is here to declare god
[1:20:27] praise be to god man is identified by
[1:20:31] the works that he does so our work
[1:20:32] should be good see
[1:20:34] always good because we are representing
[1:20:36] our lord
[1:20:37] jesus christ praise be to god
[1:20:42] look at our bibles at first timothy this
[1:20:45] is the
[1:20:46] the scripture brother branham references
[1:20:47] right in the middle of this that we just
[1:20:48] read first timothy 3 16.
[1:21:01] first timothy 3 16
[1:21:04] and without controversy great is the
[1:21:06] mystery of godliness
[1:21:08] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[1:21:11] in the spirit
[1:21:13] scene of angels preached unto the
[1:21:15] gentiles
[1:21:17] believed on in the world and received up
[1:21:20] in the glory
[1:21:23] you realize that preached unto the
[1:21:25] gentiles part was not
[1:21:27] jesus's earthly ministry
[1:21:30] that's still going on now that's through
[1:21:32] the church ages
[1:21:35] so it starts in jesus christ
[1:21:38] and this scripture continues through the
[1:21:40] church jesus
[1:21:41] until the combination of the ages and
[1:21:43] the resurrection of the sleeping saints
[1:21:45] and the translation of the bodies
[1:21:47] finishes this verse because he was
[1:21:48] received up in the glory
[1:21:51] what was received up in the glory god
[1:21:57] treat it again without controversy great
[1:21:59] is the mystery of godliness
[1:22:01] god was god god was god
[1:22:05] god was manifest in the flesh
[1:22:09] justifying the spirit scene of angels
[1:22:11] preached unto the gentiles
[1:22:13] received up into glory
[1:22:16] praise be to god you and i are included
[1:22:19] in that verse in the manifestation of
[1:22:21] god
[1:22:23] hallelujah why because god has been
[1:22:25] dividing himself out
[1:22:27] as a family attributes of himself
[1:22:29] portioned out for each age and each time
[1:22:31] to be expressed
[1:22:32] to express part of his nature express
[1:22:35] part of his attributes
[1:22:36] express part of his plan of redemption
[1:22:38] amen and god is going to gather himself
[1:22:41] all back together again
[1:22:42] and live as a family upon this earth
[1:22:46] praise be to god so how is the invisible
[1:22:49] god
[1:22:49] made manifest right here
[1:22:52] right here is the invisible god made
[1:22:55] manifest
[1:22:56] that's why it matters what we do what we
[1:22:58] say what we think where we go what we do
[1:23:00] everything we touch the way we dress
[1:23:02] ourselves the things we let in our eyes
[1:23:04] the things we let in our ears
[1:23:05] it all matters because this is supposed
[1:23:07] to be the temple
[1:23:08] the habitation of god the temple of the
[1:23:11] holy spirit
[1:23:12] to manifest god himself
[1:23:15] that's why all of these things matter
[1:23:18] it's important
[1:23:20] praise god let's go to paragraph 26.
[1:23:24] we we answered our questions there and
[1:23:26] there could be many other places where
[1:23:28] he answered those again those are just
[1:23:29] the ones i want to pull from
[1:23:31] but paragraph 26.
[1:23:40] now today as we face new year's i want
[1:23:42] to think of not like the past but i want
[1:23:44] to look to the future
[1:23:47] this is amazing we're going to read this
[1:23:49] paragraph
[1:23:50] and it's going to absolutely be
[1:23:52] shockingly amazing because we'll say
[1:23:54] 1963 was some of the greatest
[1:23:56] manifestations that's ever been on the
[1:23:58] face of this earth
[1:24:01] the cloud i mean what a manifestation
[1:24:04] what a declaration in heaven and that
[1:24:06] cloud picture went all over the world
[1:24:10] the preaching of the seals the all the
[1:24:12] manifestations
[1:24:13] 1963 was an outstanding year and brother
[1:24:16] branham said it's been one of the
[1:24:17] highest years of his life for visions
[1:24:19] and things
[1:24:21] but brother branham did not want to stay
[1:24:24] in 1963
[1:24:25] or look back to 1963 he said i'm looking
[1:24:28] to the future now
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:31] you realize we shouldn't be stuck there
[1:24:34] either amen if he was looking to the
[1:24:36] future
[1:24:36] for what was coming next we should be
[1:24:38] looking to the future for what's coming
[1:24:40] next
[1:24:40] not stuck somewhere in the prophet's
[1:24:42] ministry saying this was great amen the
[1:24:44] prophet himself
[1:24:45] wouldn't stay there so the highest year
[1:24:49] for me for visions and stuff
[1:24:50] amen supernatural light in the sky life
[1:24:53] magazine
[1:24:53] talks about that but i'm not this year
[1:24:55] looking to the past
[1:24:56] but i'm looking to the future praise be
[1:25:00] to god
[1:25:01] friends our best days are coming
[1:25:04] the greatest manifestations are coming
[1:25:06] amen the greatest declarations are
[1:25:08] coming
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:11] praise be to god he goes on to say now
[1:25:16] i want to think i'm not like the past
[1:25:18] but i want to look to the future as paul
[1:25:20] said forgetting those things that
[1:25:21] they're in the past
[1:25:23] i pressed towards the marxy of the high
[1:25:25] calling
[1:25:26] and as it expressed look like looking
[1:25:28] back through the mirror of a car we are
[1:25:30] looking what we
[1:25:31] have passed when we're looking in the
[1:25:32] rear view mirror now we're not
[1:25:34] trying to place the message today as
[1:25:36] looking through a rear view mirror
[1:25:38] it would take too long see those things
[1:25:40] that the lord has did
[1:25:41] and are you all acquainted with the
[1:25:42] great things that our lord has been
[1:25:44] doing
[1:25:44] is some of the mightiest things that
[1:25:46] i've ever seen in my life
[1:25:48] it's just passing in the last few months
[1:25:51] and but
[1:25:52] now we are thankful for what has been
[1:25:54] but we're now we're looking forward
[1:25:56] we're looking where we're headed for
[1:25:58] into this 1964.
[1:26:01] praise be to god the prophet if he can
[1:26:04] make that transition
[1:26:05] we should be able to do the same i thank
[1:26:08] god for what's been
[1:26:09] i thank god for the manifestations i
[1:26:11] thank god for what we've seen
[1:26:12] i thank god for the revelations amen but
[1:26:14] i'm not looking back
[1:26:16] and i'm not looking to the message in a
[1:26:17] rear view mirror but we're looking
[1:26:19] forward for what's coming next
[1:26:21] with anticipation
[1:26:25] let's look at paragraph 43
[1:26:33] paragraph 43 then the church the reason
[1:26:36] i say shalom to them

[1:26:43] but we're looking forward to the
[1:26:45] breaking of a new day
