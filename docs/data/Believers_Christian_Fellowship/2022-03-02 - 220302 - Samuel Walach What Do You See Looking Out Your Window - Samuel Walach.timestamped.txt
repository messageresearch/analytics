[2:29] amen god bless you
[2:32] amen may we see him in the breaking of
[2:34] bread this evening
[2:36] because he revealed himself to his
[2:38] disciples on the road to emmaus by the
[2:40] way he broke the bread
[2:42] amen god bless you it's a pleasure to be
[2:44] here together we're excited to have
[2:46] brother samuel
[2:47] vawak i've been saying his last name
[2:50] wrong for a couple years now
[2:51] so i i learned how to say it better and
[2:53] it's probably still not right but
[2:55] hopefully it's better but we're happy to
[2:56] have him we know his as father brother
[2:58] yadzik he's been here before and i first
[3:01] met brother samuel in 2019 when i was
[3:03] there in their place and then their
[3:04] church
[3:05] and we had a good time there he did the
[3:07] interpreting for me and he's a very
[3:08] gifted interpreter we had a good time
[3:10] together during the service and i'm
[3:13] excited that he's able to stop by he was
[3:15] in the united states preaching in some
[3:16] other places and i asked him to let me
[3:18] know if he ever comes and he was
[3:20] faithful to do that and i said please
[3:22] include us in your trip and so he was
[3:24] able to make it work so we're very
[3:26] thankful that he's here today and so i
[3:29] pray that you'll just pull on the gift
[3:30] and just relax and receive the word from
[3:33] our lord today
[3:34] i got two announcements i want to make
[3:36] real quick before we turn the service
[3:38] over
[3:38] next wednesday we're going to start our
[3:40] tape service i always like to go through
[3:42] a tape together where we go through the
[3:44] book and listen to the tape together we
[3:46] ask the questions before and we answer
[3:48] them afterwards well i'd like to do that
[3:50] every winter but we're going to start
[3:52] that this coming wednesday the tape that
[3:54] we're going to do is god's power to
[3:56] transform from 1965 from september 11th
[3:59] so sunday we'll set all the books out
[4:02] on a rack out here by the welcome desk
[4:04] so you can get a fresh book or if you've
[4:06] got a book or if you want to use your
[4:07] tablet uh that's the that's the message
[4:10] that we'll be going through i think
[4:11] it'll take us three wednesdays to go
[4:13] through that so you can pick up your
[4:15] book i'll remind you again on sunday to
[4:18] pick that up so we'll start that on
[4:19] wednesday also several
[4:21] of the brothers and sisters have asked
[4:23] if there's any way that we can get funds
[4:25] to the brethren in ukraine so i've been
[4:27] working on that today and we've found a
[4:30] couple different ways that we're
[4:31] exploring to get some funds over to the
[4:33] believers there they're in desperate
[4:35] need many are trying to travel to
[4:38] western ukraine to get out of the
[4:39] country or just get away from the
[4:41] fighting others are stuck where they're
[4:43] at and can't get out
[4:45] shelves are empty their economy is
[4:47] plunging you know there's just a lot of
[4:49] trouble but there's some ways that
[4:51] brothers have been able to get funds in
[4:53] so we're sending some funds
[4:55] tomorrow to be able to help if you would
[4:57] like to send something if you just on
[4:59] the tithe envelope will mark on special
[5:01] needs just ukraine or ukrainian brethren
[5:04] we'll make sure that we do all we can to
[5:06] get that to them
[5:07] this is a tough time
[5:09] amen but we're one family
[5:12] and so we'd like to do whatever we can
[5:14] for them there
[5:15] amen
[5:17] so if you would like to do that just
[5:18] remember that on the tithe envelope god
[5:20] bless you
[5:21] amen let's turn our hearts to the lord
[5:23] and let's
[5:24] receive the word amen this evening
[5:27] brother ben if we could invite our
[5:28] brother with a song
[5:32] [Music]
[5:44] gently
[5:45] [Music]
[6:00] is
[6:03] [Music]
[6:14] amen praise the lord
[6:17] that's what we are longing for to be in
[6:19] the presence of the lord
[6:21] so i believe that we are in a good place
[6:23] at the right time with the right people
[6:26] i believe that god is here i believe
[6:29] that he is going to bless us tonight
[6:32] hopefully you didn't come for any man
[6:35] you know to see a person to see somebody
[6:38] but we all gathered here with one
[6:40] purpose to see god
[6:42] you know we want to see god but he isn't
[6:44] somewhere
[6:45] you know above the clouds we need to
[6:48] recognize where he is tonight
[6:51] and i believe if we recognize that
[6:53] then he is going to bless us
[6:55] because he always blesses those that
[6:57] recognize his presence
[6:59] amen that that make him feel welcome
[7:02] that's what we want to do tonight amen
[7:05] so i bring greetings from our church
[7:07] back home from poland
[7:09] from baja novitse uh from my pastor
[7:12] who's also my dad brother yatzek valach
[7:15] he was here i think in 2020
[7:18] and he sends his greetings amen
[7:21] so i also appreciate barry chad for
[7:24] the opportunity that he gave me to be
[7:27] with you and
[7:29] and to share with the word of god i
[7:30] believe that
[7:32] he's going to speak to us tonight amen
[7:35] so
[7:37] while you're standing let's open ii
[7:39] samuel chapter 6 verses 14
[7:43] through
[7:44] 23
[7:49] maybe that's a more lengthy
[7:52] portion of scripture but we'll go
[7:54] through it and
[7:55] lay a foundation
[7:57] amen
[8:04] amen if we are all right with the fact
[8:07] that
[8:08] like paul says that it pleases the lord
[8:11] to use the foolishness of preaching to
[8:13] save man if we are comfortable with that
[8:16] fact i believe that we all will be
[8:17] blessed tonight
[8:19] amen
[8:20] so let's read second samuel chapter 6
[8:24] verses 14
[8:26] to 23
[8:28] and david danced before the lord with
[8:31] all his might
[8:32] and david was girded
[8:34] with a linen ephod
[8:37] so david and all the house of israel
[8:39] brought up the ark of the lord with
[8:42] shouting and with the sound of the
[8:44] trumpet
[8:45] and as the ark of the lord came into the
[8:47] city of david
[8:49] michael saul's daughter looked through a
[8:52] window and saw king david
[8:55] leaping and dancing before the lord
[8:57] and she despised him in her heart
[9:00] and they brought up the ark of the lord
[9:03] and set it in its place
[9:05] in the midst of the tabernacle that
[9:06] david had pitched for it and david
[9:09] offered burned offerings and peace
[9:11] offerings before the lord
[9:13] and as soon as david had made an end of
[9:17] offering burnt offerings and peace
[9:19] offerings he blessed the people in the
[9:21] name of the lord of hosts
[9:23] and he dealt among all the people even
[9:26] among the whole multitude of israel
[9:29] as well to the women as men
[9:31] to everyone a cake of bread and a good
[9:34] piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
[9:37] and all the people departed everyone to
[9:39] his house
[9:41] then david turned to bless his household
[9:44] and michael the daughter of saul came
[9:46] out to meet david and said how glorious
[9:49] was the king of israel today who
[9:52] uncovered himself today in the eyes of
[9:54] the handmaids of his servants as one of
[9:57] the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth
[10:01] himself
[10:02] and david said unto michael
[10:04] it was before the lord
[10:06] which chose me before thy father and
[10:08] before all his house to appoint me ruler
[10:11] over the people of the lord over israel
[10:14] therefore i will play before the lord
[10:17] and i will yet be more be more vile than
[10:20] thus
[10:21] and will be based in mine own sight and
[10:25] of the made servants which thou has
[10:27] spoken of of them shall i be had in
[10:30] honor
[10:31] therefore michael the daughter of saul
[10:34] had no child under the day of her death
[10:38] and a short scripture found in luke
[10:40] chapter 7
[10:42] verses 22 and 23
[10:48] look chapter 7
[10:51] verse 22 and 23
[10:55] it's the portion of scripture when john
[10:57] the baptist while he's in prison
[11:01] he sends his disciples to
[11:03] ask
[11:04] if jesus was truly the messiah if he was
[11:08] christ if he was the one that was
[11:10] supposed to come and we see the answer
[11:12] of jesus to their question then jesus
[11:15] answered unto them go your way and tell
[11:18] john what things you have seen and heard
[11:22] how that the blind see the lame walk the
[11:25] lepers are cleansed the death here the
[11:28] dead are raised to the poor the gospel
[11:30] is preached
[11:32] and i'd like to stress verse 23 and
[11:35] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[11:38] offended in me
[11:40] amen whosoever shall not be offended in
[11:45] me
[11:46] amen let's bow our heads for a word of
[11:48] prayer
[11:50] dear heavenly father
[11:52] we come into your presence father
[11:54] and like your prophet said that we are
[11:57] creators we are creators of atmosphere
[12:00] father
[12:01] and tonight we want to
[12:03] create the atmosphere of faith father
[12:06] because we realize that's the atmosphere
[12:08] that you like that's the atmosphere that
[12:11] pleases you and that's the atmosphere
[12:13] that you're comfortable in father so i
[12:15] believe if we
[12:17] create that kind of atmosphere
[12:19] you're going to perform wonders father
[12:22] you're going to come to this building
[12:25] father walk among the pews father reach
[12:28] all of the hearts all of the needs all
[12:30] of the people that are gathered here
[12:32] father we need you we are a needy people
[12:35] father we need to hear from you once
[12:37] again
[12:38] may you take every flesh out of the way
[12:40] father my own flesh and the people that
[12:43] came to listen father may we all be set
[12:46] out of the way and may the word of god
[12:49] has have its preeminence father that's
[12:52] what we ask that's what we need we bless
[12:54] the portion of scripture that we've read
[12:56] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[13:00] amen you may take your seats
[13:02] praise the lord
[13:05] i'd like to share with you on a on a
[13:07] topic
[13:08] what do you see looking out your window
[13:11] what do you see looking out your window
[13:15] amen
[13:17] so we are thankful for the message
[13:19] amen
[13:20] and and we can talk about it you know
[13:24] uh over and over again but if we truly
[13:27] realize
[13:28] what the message is and who the message
[13:31] is we can be truly
[13:34] thankful to the lord
[13:36] amen so
[13:37] and before receiving the message
[13:40] we need to realize the day that we are
[13:42] living in because brad brown said that
[13:44] we need to recognize our day and its
[13:47] message
[13:48] amen so we realize the times that we are
[13:51] living in and we are recognized that we
[13:54] are called to be a people of this time
[13:57] to live in the end time age to perform
[14:00] the work for the for the end time age a
[14:04] man and there was always a message which
[14:07] was allotted for a certain group of
[14:09] people
[14:10] for a certain period of time
[14:13] and we see that throughout the ages that
[14:16] there was a portion of the message being
[14:18] released to the people
[14:20] but if we realize the time that we are
[14:22] living in that that's the end time we
[14:26] realize that's the time of the
[14:27] restoration of the entirety of that book
[14:31] of that fullness
[14:32] so we are not waiting just for a portion
[14:35] another portion another blessing another
[14:38] reformer another message
[14:41] we see that the message is the
[14:43] restoration of everything
[14:45] because the message was sent to restore
[14:48] all of the loose ends and tie them
[14:51] together
[14:52] amen we believe that
[14:54] and we know that all of the ages the
[14:58] church ages before us that was one thing
[15:01] but then we see brother bruno who
[15:03] preached the the sermon he
[15:05] we we know that he preached on the
[15:07] exposition of the seven church ages but
[15:09] then he went into the seals and before
[15:12] preaching the seals he preached this the
[15:14] sermon the breach
[15:16] between the seven church ages and the
[15:19] seven seals and we see that's not a a
[15:22] bridge that's not something that you go
[15:25] easily from the church ages into the
[15:27] seals it's a breach it's a gap it's
[15:30] something
[15:31] it's it's
[15:32] it's a chasm that is between so it is
[15:35] not easy for the church to follow into
[15:39] the seals and we know that the seals are
[15:41] christ
[15:42] so we are truly privileged if
[15:45] we are we are
[15:47] able to see what the seals are
[15:50] and who the seals are
[15:52] praise the lord so
[15:54] we appreciate the message very much
[15:57] you know and we see
[15:59] sometimes problems
[16:01] with the people around the message
[16:03] there are no problems with the message
[16:05] itself we see that there are problems
[16:08] within the ranks of the message or the
[16:10] people that are associated with the
[16:12] message
[16:14] and the problem is that they do not
[16:16] understand what the message is
[16:19] amen they see it as an information they
[16:23] see it as something
[16:26] a good addition to their christian life
[16:29] they see that
[16:30] that's a message of william branham the
[16:33] man
[16:34] you know they they think it is something
[16:36] that came out of jeffersonville or came
[16:39] out of arizona or was preached in 1950
[16:42] or 60 you know that something that
[16:45] started i don't know in 1909 or 1950 or
[16:49] 1963 whatever the date is
[16:52] if they think that way that becomes a
[16:55] powerless religion that's why we see
[16:57] people leaving and i believe there are
[17:00] many who live in the states there are
[17:03] people certainly who leave the message
[17:06] in poland because we are at the end time
[17:10] and everybody has to show their colors
[17:13] so we truly need to understand what the
[17:16] message is you know and messi the
[17:19] message is certainly not something that
[17:22] you can associate to a certain date or a
[17:25] certain century or to some man you know
[17:28] because the message is not framed in
[17:30] time it is not earthbound it is not not
[17:34] time limited it is eternal
[17:36] amen i was truly blessed when i looked
[17:39] at the word logos the word logos in the
[17:42] dictionary we know that means the word
[17:45] we know is the expression of one's
[17:47] thought
[17:48] the other meaning is speech
[17:51] but there is also another meaning of the
[17:53] word logos which is message
[17:55] i was truly blessed when i read that
[17:58] you know because
[17:59] we see that the message is not something
[18:01] new it's not a new idea it is not
[18:04] something that was invented in the 20th
[18:07] century it was not something that
[18:09] brother brown thought of or brought out
[18:12] it he was just the channel he was just
[18:15] the tool but the message itself is
[18:17] eternal
[18:18] is as eternal as logos is praise the
[18:21] lord so we are following something
[18:23] eternal something of of an eternal value
[18:27] which is not
[18:28] framed in time
[18:31] so we can be
[18:33] thankful for that amen in the oncoming
[18:36] storm brother brown says oh you might
[18:38] laugh at the messenger
[18:40] you might be able even to kill him
[18:43] but you cannot kill the message
[18:46] it will go on just the same because
[18:48] god's message
[18:50] is eternal
[18:52] his word will never fail
[18:54] amen so that gives us the confidence
[18:56] that we need in this hour
[18:58] because everything that can be shaken
[19:00] will be shaken and we see that it is
[19:03] being shaken right now so we need that
[19:06] confidence that the message is something
[19:08] eternal something that came straight out
[19:11] of the mind of god and that is sent for
[19:14] the specific time that we live in for
[19:16] the specific people that we are to lead
[19:19] us to a specific purpose to a specific
[19:22] goal which is the rapture which is just
[19:24] which is the changing of our bodies amen
[19:27] because we need to get out of here and
[19:30] the only way how we can get out of here
[19:32] in from the earthly to the heavenly from
[19:35] the mortal to the immortal getting out
[19:38] to eternity is receiving an eternal
[19:41] portion which is the eternal message of
[19:43] god sent for this hour
[19:45] amen
[19:46] so we are called upon to receive the
[19:48] message and we are also called upon for
[19:52] a specific purpose
[19:54] and we know the scripture found in
[19:56] isaiah 60 it says arise and shine for
[20:00] thy light has come
[20:01] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[20:03] thee amen for behold the darkness shall
[20:07] cover the earth and grows darkness the
[20:10] people but the lord
[20:12] shall arise upon thee and his glory
[20:15] shall be seen upon thee amen that's a
[20:18] great promise it's not a promise
[20:21] only about our times that we see
[20:23] darkness and we see the light but this
[20:25] is becoming personal
[20:27] because it's not only that
[20:29] this sun shines
[20:32] you know a great light but it says die
[20:35] light has come
[20:36] amen and if we take it personally that
[20:40] becomes a powerful statement to us
[20:42] amen because that's your light that's my
[20:44] light
[20:46] amen praise the lord so we know that the
[20:49] darkness covers the nation
[20:51] the nations all around us but there
[20:53] shall be light in the evening time amen
[20:56] and however dark it will get and we've
[20:59] seen some dark moments in recent years
[21:03] but however
[21:04] dark it will get the promise still holds
[21:08] that there shall be light about the
[21:10] evening time
[21:12] and that is your light this is my light
[21:14] amen because we know that james says
[21:18] that he
[21:20] is the father of lights
[21:22] it doesn't say he is the father of light
[21:24] we knew that but right now we realize
[21:27] that he is the father of lights and we
[21:29] are those lights amen and that's why
[21:33] isaiah could say thy light has come so
[21:36] arise and shine amen
[21:39] though there is gross darkness
[21:41] in the earth
[21:43] all around us there's gross darkness
[21:45] amen
[21:47] because all around us
[21:49] we see laodicea which is blind
[21:53] naked
[21:54] and in darkness
[21:56] and doesn't know it
[21:58] but yet there is light in the land of
[22:00] goshen
[22:01] so we see the world that we
[22:04] live in
[22:05] we see the world of human rights
[22:08] we see the world of abundance
[22:11] of being self-sufficient of being
[22:14] independent
[22:15] we see
[22:17] people being rich
[22:19] and that's why they do not need god they
[22:21] do not need anything else
[22:24] but
[22:24] themselves amen so we see the state of
[22:28] the world around us brett brown told us
[22:31] that
[22:32] people are getting wiser but they are
[22:34] getting weaker
[22:36] amen and we can feel that we are still
[22:39] in those human bodies and when i compare
[22:42] myself to
[22:44] my grandparents you know even my parents
[22:47] i believe that
[22:48] the
[22:49] the flesh that i'm in it's weaker
[22:52] because of the food because of the
[22:54] circumstances everything else
[22:56] you know and we see it among the people
[22:58] that their bodies are weak
[23:01] people are getting wiser but they are
[23:03] weaker they are also weaker in their
[23:05] spirits
[23:07] we see a lot of mental illnesses around
[23:09] the world
[23:11] we see depression we see all kinds of
[23:13] issues when it comes to the human spirit
[23:16] and that's why it is said that we are
[23:18] weaker and weaker but yet wiser on the
[23:21] other side
[23:23] amen
[23:25] and the age that we live in is a
[23:27] peculiar age is
[23:29] is
[23:31] not to be compared with other ages
[23:33] and one of the things that we see in the
[23:36] world today is that
[23:38] the world gets offended real quickly
[23:42] amen
[23:43] i believe that
[23:45] especially in in
[23:47] in europe and in the united states
[23:50] we can see that how people are
[23:52] oversensitive
[23:54] they are sensitive on a number of issues
[23:57] number of topics you can offend them
[24:00] easily by your words
[24:03] because
[24:04] it is the time where the word has power
[24:08] we know that the word has power and also
[24:11] the word
[24:12] in the natural seems to have power over
[24:15] the people it can hurt people it can
[24:17] offend people just natural words
[24:20] whatever you speak your opinions your
[24:22] decisions your actions
[24:24] they have a certain influence on the
[24:27] people and they get offended
[24:30] and an offense is the condition of
[24:32] having your feelings hurt as a result of
[24:35] somebody's actions or words
[24:40] so usually people who get offended
[24:43] get offended
[24:45] at things that are none of their
[24:46] business
[24:48] they
[24:49] they are offended at things that do not
[24:51] affect them directly or indirectly
[24:55] that's how people get offended they get
[24:57] offended about comments of people
[25:00] they do not know they do not care about
[25:02] but they get offended anyhow
[25:05] that's the times that we are living in
[25:07] and i believe that the natural types the
[25:09] spiritual so if there is an issue in the
[25:12] natural world there is also an issue
[25:15] that we need to notice
[25:17] in the other realm
[25:19] because
[25:20] all that we see is a manifestation of
[25:23] the spiritual world
[25:26] either
[25:27] the good side of spiritual world or the
[25:29] bad side of the spiritual world because
[25:31] that's a battle amen
[25:34] so people are offended by some of these
[25:36] choices or opinions or decisions or or
[25:39] the way somebody lives their lives so
[25:42] it's a generation of people who are
[25:44] oversensitive
[25:45] you know and people can be
[25:47] can can be offended by
[25:50] virtually anything
[25:52] you know even even in the church you
[25:54] know people get offended
[25:56] if because some people like for their
[25:58] preacher to preach 45 minutes the other
[26:02] wants them
[26:03] to preach for two hours and you've got
[26:05] people offended at the end of the
[26:06] service so if you came tonight with an
[26:09] expectation i don't know what your
[26:11] expectation is
[26:13] but i'm sure if there is an expectation
[26:16] about the time limit somebody
[26:19] may
[26:20] you know
[26:21] may come out of the service and their
[26:23] expectation was not met
[26:25] amen so we live it in a time you know
[26:28] that people get offended over every
[26:31] issue we see the issue maybe somebody is
[26:34] vaccinated somebody is not you know
[26:36] people get offended people break
[26:38] fellowship with each other over these
[26:41] things you know somebody goes on
[26:43] holidays every year somebody doesn't
[26:45] because he thinks that makes him
[26:47] spiritual and then he's offended that
[26:49] the other person goes on holidays
[26:53] that's right
[26:55] or that's just in europe
[26:58] no
[26:59] i mean somebody buys a new car and
[27:02] somebody's offended by the one that
[27:04] that bought the new car
[27:06] somebody else drives a a beater you know
[27:10] a truck that doesn't you know it's old
[27:12] and rusty and so on and somebody else is
[27:15] also offended
[27:16] because that's that's not how christians
[27:19] are supposed to live they should be
[27:20] blessed they should prosper you know so
[27:23] we get people whatever you do there is
[27:26] somebody who is going to be offended
[27:28] amen
[27:29] so there are endless ways to get
[27:31] offended
[27:32] and and us as human beings we are uh
[27:37] we are good creators of of offenses of
[27:40] of things
[27:42] that we can be offended by amen but i
[27:45] believe i'm saying all of that to show
[27:47] us that i believe that's the sign of the
[27:51] times that we live in
[27:52] actually we'll
[27:54] look into matthew the 24th chapter
[27:58] a very well-known scripture
[28:02] that speaks of our times
[28:04] matthew the 24th chapter
[28:08] from verse 5.
[28:16] for many shall come in my name saying i
[28:19] am christ
[28:21] and shall deceive many
[28:23] and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
[28:27] wars
[28:29] see that ye
[28:30] be not troubled for all these things
[28:33] must come to pass
[28:35] but the end is not yet
[28:37] for nation shall rise against nation and
[28:39] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[28:42] be famine
[28:43] and pestilence and earthquakes in
[28:46] diverse places
[28:48] all these are the beginning of sorrows
[28:50] amen so i believe that we can agree that
[28:53] we see all of these things happening
[28:56] we see we've heard rumors of wars now we
[28:59] see wars happening and
[29:02] you know in poland we see wars happening
[29:04] at our doorstep you know it's closer
[29:07] than we than we thought even a week ago
[29:10] but
[29:11] we are not surprised because we can read
[29:13] it in the scripture you know
[29:15] the same goes for pestilence we've seen
[29:18] the pandemic we've seen covet 19 for the
[29:21] last two years you know so we shouldn't
[29:24] be surprised these these things are
[29:26] coming because
[29:27] god told us they would
[29:30] amen
[29:32] verse 9 then shall they deliver you up
[29:35] to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[29:38] ye shall be hated of all nations for my
[29:41] name's sake
[29:43] verse 10 and then shall many be offended
[29:46] and shall betray one another and shall
[29:48] hate one another and many false prophets
[29:51] shall rise and shall deceive many and
[29:54] because iniquity shall abound the love
[29:56] of many shall wax called
[29:59] but he that shall endure
[30:01] unto the end
[30:03] the same shall be saved
[30:06] amen so we see the things that are
[30:09] foretold about the end times we see the
[30:12] natural things happening and we are not
[30:14] surprised by that we see the things that
[30:18] are foretold about people's attitude how
[30:22] how
[30:23] how mankind or people around us would
[30:27] uh would act in the end times amen and
[30:31] it says that many shall be offended
[30:34] a sign of the end times
[30:37] we know that offense will come
[30:40] but the bible says woe unto the one that
[30:42] the offense comes by amen
[30:46] and the word offense
[30:48] is the greek word scandalon and i i
[30:50] truly like this word sometimes i i like
[30:53] to i'm not
[30:54] i don't know greek i don't know hebrew i
[30:56] don't know anything about it but then
[30:59] sometimes i check it and the meaning is
[31:01] really powerful it goes deeper than i
[31:03] thought
[31:05] and the word offense is scandalous in
[31:08] greek and it means offense or it means a
[31:12] trap
[31:13] and exactly the trigger of a trap
[31:16] like you have a mousetrap and there is a
[31:18] trigger for the trap
[31:20] hey man
[31:22] so that's the mechanism that closes the
[31:24] trap wherever
[31:26] whenever the mouse comes in
[31:29] so
[31:30] and also the trigger of the trap
[31:33] is very sensitive
[31:36] you don't need much force or power to
[31:39] activate it
[31:41] you just need a little bit of emotion
[31:46] amen
[31:48] and then it's going to kill you
[31:51] that's a mousetrap that's scandal that's
[31:53] offense amen
[31:55] you know but if it says that it's it's a
[31:58] trap
[32:00] i believe that we've been given a
[32:02] message and brother brown tells us that
[32:06] victory means knowing our enemy in all
[32:09] his tricks all his traps all his ways of
[32:13] waging war
[32:15] amen so we see in the bible let's go
[32:18] through the bible through different
[32:20] examples of
[32:22] how people got offended
[32:24] and
[32:25] you know if you think about people being
[32:27] offended the first thing you'll notice
[32:30] it was the pharisees in the old
[32:32] testament or the new testament
[32:34] you know the pharisees in the bible they
[32:36] were the most
[32:37] uh
[32:38] offensible
[32:40] people that there ever was whatever you
[32:42] did
[32:43] that didn't match their tradition or
[32:46] their interpretation of the law they
[32:48] would be offended
[32:50] and we see through
[32:52] uh the gospels that
[32:54] they were offended by jesus on every
[32:56] step
[32:58] amen because jesus
[33:01] being god in human flesh
[33:04] he was god in human flesh so they they
[33:07] were offended by what he did in that
[33:09] flesh
[33:10] amen
[33:12] praise the lord you know they saw jesus
[33:15] coming
[33:16] during the sabbath
[33:18] on different occasions actually it
[33:19] wasn't just
[33:21] something that he did once he made a
[33:23] mistake or something like that no he did
[33:25] it multiple times during the sabbath
[33:27] that he would either perform a certain
[33:29] work or heal somebody you know or
[33:33] or do something that would distract
[33:36] their order
[33:37] so they were offended that he would do
[33:39] something on the sabbath not knowing
[33:41] that he was the lord of the sabbath
[33:44] amen he was the rest
[33:47] he was the one that was leading people
[33:50] into rest not a day of the week but a
[33:53] person
[33:55] something real
[33:56] amen praise the lord but the pharisees
[33:59] they were offended they were offended by
[34:01] the disciples while they were going
[34:04] through a field they would gather wheat
[34:07] and probably that was also on sabbath
[34:09] but so there are multiple occasions how
[34:13] pharisees could be
[34:15] offended
[34:17] we see when jesus was coming down to
[34:20] jerusalem there were people crying they
[34:22] were people shouting hosanna hosanna
[34:27] and the pharisees came to jesus came to
[34:29] his disciples and said we are offended
[34:32] we are offended by what the people say
[34:34] how they shout and jesus said if they do
[34:37] not shout if they do not cry out the
[34:40] rocks will
[34:41] amen so so pharisees were offended again
[34:45] and again and again
[34:47] when jesus
[34:48] healed the blind person
[34:50] they were offended again
[34:53] well they were
[34:54] offended also by the fact or by the way
[34:58] he performed that miracle
[35:00] you know because he came
[35:02] as a rabbi as somebody who taught
[35:06] the gospel who taught
[35:08] uh the law or or who was a teacher some
[35:11] of them called him teacher
[35:13] but then he came to a blind person and
[35:16] he spat on the ground he made mud he put
[35:19] it on his eyes and he told him to walk
[35:24] amen they were offended
[35:28] so it didn't take much for them to be
[35:30] offended because they were very
[35:32] religious so if somebody is very
[35:35] religious they easily get offended
[35:37] amen that's how
[35:39] how you can sense or see or recognize a
[35:42] very religious person he gets offended
[35:45] all the time
[35:46] all the time
[35:48] amen but we do not want to deal with you
[35:51] know the pharisees or or the nominations
[35:54] or somebody else you know the outside
[35:56] world we know that's true for for all of
[36:00] them that they easily get offended but
[36:02] let's look a little bit closer
[36:06] we see in the times of jacob jacob's
[36:09] sons there were 12 of them 10 came from
[36:12] leah and two came from rachel
[36:15] and
[36:17] we know that rachel was the beloved wife
[36:20] of jacob
[36:22] it was the wife that he
[36:24] chose as the first wife but then he was
[36:28] tricked into marrying leah and he had to
[36:30] work his way for
[36:32] uh for rachel
[36:33] you know and so
[36:36] she she was the beloved wife and there
[36:38] was this other wife that was also there
[36:40] who gave jacob more children 10 10
[36:44] children 10 sons
[36:46] but we see that there was always a
[36:49] rivalry between the sisters between
[36:52] rachel and leah they would always
[36:54] compete for the the status of the
[36:56] beloved wife
[36:58] which didn't help because
[37:01] rachel was always beloved from the very
[37:03] beginning to the very end
[37:05] jacob never changed his mind on that
[37:07] whatever leah tried to produce however
[37:11] many sons she would produce that would
[37:13] not change anything in god's program
[37:16] that's what we see we see churches they
[37:18] try to produce program after program
[37:20] they try to produce fruit after fruit
[37:23] after fruit but yet nothing will change
[37:25] their status
[37:28] there is one beloved wife
[37:30] and that's the bride of christ
[37:32] amen but we see that they competed for
[37:36] or actually maybe uh it was leah who
[37:38] tried to compete for for the number one
[37:41] position and we see that
[37:44] it had an effect on the children as well
[37:47] we see that there there was also a
[37:49] difference between the the the children
[37:52] of rachel which was joseph and benjamin
[37:54] and of the rest of the
[37:57] of the sons of jacob that came from leah
[38:00] and we see that it didn't make it any
[38:04] better when jacob
[38:06] gave joseph a coat of many colors
[38:12] actually that's not a good
[38:14] parental advice
[38:17] to pick one child and make him
[38:20] the most
[38:21] favorite one
[38:23] you know
[38:26] and so
[38:27] he would
[38:28] get he got this coat of many colors and
[38:31] so the brothers of joseph they they were
[38:33] really offended by it
[38:34] they were offended by the drop you know
[38:37] they they were not
[38:38] just offended by the robe because it was
[38:40] special it was it was colorful it was
[38:43] new it was something else
[38:45] you know but
[38:47] uh
[38:48] you know they were offended by something
[38:50] else
[38:51] because it symbolized something that he
[38:54] was chosen that joseph was the chosen
[38:56] child the chosen son
[39:00] and you know the the the sons of leah
[39:04] uh they knew that this code came from
[39:08] the father
[39:09] they knew it was
[39:10] the father's code given to joseph
[39:14] amen they realized that
[39:16] but yet it was offensive to them
[39:19] even though they knew that it was the
[39:21] father's gift
[39:23] amen
[39:24] so it was a trap it is a trap
[39:28] it was a chaff for them because they got
[39:30] offended
[39:31] and you know they started to plot to
[39:33] kill him
[39:36] you always have a choice either to get
[39:38] offended it's your choice to get
[39:40] offended or not
[39:42] that's our choice
[39:44] we can either choose to be offended
[39:47] by somebody else or we choose not to be
[39:50] offended that's our choice
[39:52] and we know that the enemy comes to
[39:55] steal to kill and to devour
[39:58] and the spirit of offense
[40:01] is just that kind of spirit it's the
[40:03] spirit of the enemy
[40:06] it's an assassin in white gloves
[40:09] you know
[40:10] he smiles
[40:12] he he acts real nice
[40:14] but if he's offended
[40:16] he's bitter on the inside he's going to
[40:18] kill you
[40:22] that's how
[40:23] satan wants to trap us he wants to lay
[40:26] traps on us he wants those little
[40:28] triggers of that traps to go off every
[40:31] time we walk every time we make a motion
[40:35] you know but that's a spirit and it
[40:37] wasn't about the new rope
[40:39] it was about the position that the
[40:40] father gave to joseph
[40:44] that's what triggered them that's what
[40:46] made them offended amen but it wasn't
[40:50] joseph
[40:51] the claim of joseph it wasn't the claim
[40:53] of joseph that he was somebody special
[40:58] it was the father
[41:00] who gave him that position hey man
[41:02] it wasn't something that he aspired for
[41:05] it wasn't the position that he hoped for
[41:08] or he he tricked somebody to to be on a
[41:11] position like that no no it was given to
[41:14] him by the father
[41:15] amen he couldn't change that
[41:19] the word
[41:21] claimed he was who he was amen he didn't
[41:24] have to claim it for himself
[41:27] he didn't have to claim i'm the beloved
[41:29] son i'm joseph i'm chosen of the father
[41:31] no the word told
[41:33] everybody that he was chosen amen praise
[41:36] the lord
[41:38] so we see that joseph received a dream
[41:40] from god
[41:42] that showed him as the main sheath
[41:45] and there would be sheaves all around
[41:47] him that would bow down to him
[41:50] and that was a dream
[41:51] and that was a dream that he had to pay
[41:53] a price for
[41:56] amen
[41:57] that was a costly dream
[41:59] he had to lay
[42:01] many years of his life being a slave in
[42:04] egypt and going through difficult
[42:07] difficulties from one difficulty to
[42:08] another
[42:09] and it was the price that he had to pay
[42:11] for his dream amen for what the word
[42:15] told him he was he had to pay for that
[42:18] amen it didn't come cheap
[42:20] amen i believe there is also a vision
[42:26] of the bride of the end time
[42:29] there is a vision given to us that you
[42:32] are part of that preview of that
[42:34] spotless
[42:36] lam's wife
[42:38] and i believe there is also a price that
[42:40] you need to pay
[42:42] it doesn't come cheap the the first
[42:44] coming of pr of christ didn't come cheap
[42:47] there was a price that had to be paid
[42:49] and that was the price of
[42:51] of of the life of the innocent lamb of
[42:54] god that had to be paid
[42:56] whatever god does is not cheap
[42:59] god is not cheap because he is rich
[43:02] he's rich in in everything in resources
[43:05] in everything so that's why when he came
[43:07] that wasn't a cheap visit amen he came
[43:11] down and it was expensive he had to pay
[43:14] the price that's why the second coming
[43:17] is is no different
[43:19] there is a prize that we need to pay as
[43:21] joseph did for the dream of the word the
[43:24] word was shown to him showed him his
[43:28] position and then he had to go through
[43:30] different things in life that brought
[43:33] him
[43:34] straight to the palace amen to his
[43:36] position praise the lord so people get
[43:39] offended brothers of joseph
[43:41] they got offended they didn't get
[43:43] offended
[43:46] by the word you know they all believed
[43:48] the word they believed abraham they
[43:51] believed isaac they believed jacob they
[43:53] believed all of these things so they
[43:55] believed the logos
[43:57] but when the logos started to pull
[44:00] pour itself out into an a vessel
[44:04] that's where the problem arose
[44:06] so it's not the logos that gets people
[44:08] offended it's the keynotes it's the
[44:11] pouring out of god emptying
[44:14] of god into human flesh that's where the
[44:17] problem arises
[44:18] and and we can see that that when the
[44:21] word comes in flesh that's where
[44:23] problems start
[44:25] when the word was with god there was no
[44:27] problem
[44:28] when when uh you know god was in the
[44:31] beginning with his own thoughts that was
[44:33] not a problem the problem was
[44:37] when he started to come in flesh
[44:39] amen when he started to manifest himself
[44:43] when the word came into fruition that
[44:45] was the problem
[44:47] amen and let's look at another example
[44:50] which is found in israel chapter 3
[44:54] verses 10 to 13.
[44:57] israel chapter 3
[44:59] verse 10
[45:01] to 13.
[45:04] is that me
[45:08] okay
[45:10] israel chapter 3 verse 10
[45:13] let's read
[45:14] and when the builders laid the
[45:16] foundation of the temple of the lord
[45:18] they set the priests in their apparel
[45:20] with trumpets and the levites the sons
[45:23] of asaph
[45:25] with symbols to praise the lord after
[45:27] the ordinance of david king of israel
[45:30] and they sang together by
[45:32] by course in praising and giving thanks
[45:35] unto the lord because he is good for his
[45:38] mercy endureth forever toward israel and
[45:41] all the people shouted with a great
[45:43] shout
[45:44] when they praised the lord because the
[45:46] foundation of the house of the lord was
[45:49] laid
[45:50] but many of the priests and levites and
[45:52] chief of the fathers were ancient men
[45:56] that had seen the first house when the
[45:58] foundation of the house was laid before
[46:01] their eyes wept with a loud voice and
[46:04] many shouted aloud for joy
[46:07] so that the people could not discern
[46:10] the noise of the shout of joy from the
[46:12] noise of the weeping of the people
[46:14] for the people shouted with a loud shout
[46:18] and the noise was heard afar off
[46:20] amen so we see israel
[46:23] in his time
[46:25] in his time we see that it was the time
[46:28] of the rebuilding of the temple
[46:30] the temple was being rebuilt
[46:32] and there were two groups of people that
[46:35] came out of babylon they came as one
[46:38] nation israelites under one commission
[46:41] from the king of of babylon uh they they
[46:44] were commissioned to come out and to
[46:47] rebuild the city and the temple
[46:50] so they came out of babylon out of
[46:52] bondage but some of them were not happy
[46:56] some of them left the the land of
[46:58] bondage with an expectation and we see
[47:01] that also happening in the time of
[47:03] exodus in time of moses that people came
[47:06] out it seemed like they came out as one
[47:09] nation under god whatever
[47:12] you know
[47:13] however it looked like at first it
[47:15] looked real nice but after a while it
[47:18] turned out that people came out with
[47:20] their own
[47:22] expectations and that's when
[47:25] trouble came because people
[47:28] wanted to see something that they didn't
[47:31] see they expected moses to go a certain
[47:34] way and he didn't they expected god to
[47:37] be somebody who he wasn't
[47:41] and that's what we see here in another
[47:44] exodus from babylon and we see the
[47:46] rebuilding of the temple
[47:48] and it was the people that were all in
[47:51] spirit it it wasn't peop
[47:53] definitely it wasn't people who were old
[47:55] in the flesh because age doesn't matter
[47:58] with god you can be very young or very
[48:01] old and be young in the spirit
[48:04] and that's what counts if you are old in
[48:06] the spirit you may be 20 years old you
[48:08] may be a teenager by but old in spirit
[48:11] that will be a problem
[48:13] so we see people who are old in spirit
[48:16] you know there are people who seen it
[48:18] all they've been there they've done that
[48:20] they they remembered the old temple
[48:23] and they were the people that got
[48:25] offended
[48:27] the fastest
[48:28] we see that we see that
[48:31] while the temple was being rebuilt it
[48:33] was the time of restoration stone after
[48:36] stone they were building from ashes to a
[48:38] glorious temple
[48:40] but yet people cried because they were
[48:43] offended because their expectations were
[48:46] not met they came out with an
[48:49] expectation of how the temple would look
[48:51] like
[48:52] and it did not fit
[48:54] their expectations their memories their
[48:56] traditions
[48:58] amen
[48:59] they're good old ways it didn't fit into
[49:02] that pattern that's why they cried they
[49:04] were not happy
[49:06] during the time of restoration seeing
[49:08] the word the word being restored they
[49:10] were not happy they cried
[49:12] amen they were offended
[49:14] they are offended by the new thing that
[49:16] god was doing
[49:20] because new is offensive
[49:22] amen new is offensive
[49:26] it is a challenge to the old ways it is
[49:28] the challenge to traditions to memories
[49:32] to history
[49:34] amen
[49:35] but god says behold i do a new thing
[49:38] amen and you shall not remember the old
[49:41] things shall not even remember the old
[49:43] things
[49:44] amen and again in the time of israel in
[49:47] the time of the rebuilding of the temple
[49:49] people were not offended by the logos
[49:52] people were
[49:54] offended by the kinos
[49:56] of how the word would come out
[49:58] manifest itself
[50:00] amen and the scripture that we've read
[50:03] from ii samuel about
[50:05] the restoration
[50:07] of the ark of the covenant
[50:09] back to his rightful place to jerusalem
[50:12] amen
[50:15] we've read in chapters in verse 16.
[50:19] and as the ark of the lord came into the
[50:22] city of david
[50:24] michael
[50:25] saul's daughter looked through a window
[50:28] and saw king david leaping and dancing
[50:30] before the lord and she despised him in
[50:33] her heart
[50:34] amen so we see
[50:37] michael
[50:38] who was the first wife of david
[50:40] was the very first wife of david like
[50:42] leah was the first wife of jacob
[50:46] and
[50:47] michael was the wife that david didn't
[50:49] like didn't love maybe he liked her but
[50:52] he didn't love her
[50:54] which for a wife is not good enough
[50:56] definitely right
[50:58] but we see uh that she came from a house
[51:02] and actually it is mentioned here and i
[51:04] think every time michael is being
[51:07] mentioned in the scripture she is
[51:08] mentioned as saul's daughter
[51:11] amen
[51:12] and we'll see what that means and how it
[51:15] affected her
[51:17] you know because we see saul
[51:20] uh we know that he was an israelite he
[51:22] was born an israelite he was born in the
[51:24] right kind of nation he at first he was
[51:26] chosen as the first king of israel
[51:29] he
[51:30] uh everything went smoothly
[51:32] but then he made a few mistakes
[51:36] that led to him
[51:38] that led to the fact that the spirit
[51:40] departed from him
[51:42] he didn't have the spirit he was an
[51:44] israelite he was
[51:45] a part of the church he was part of the
[51:47] community he was part of that nation but
[51:50] the spirit left him
[51:52] and that was a problem because from that
[51:55] time saul wanted to kill david
[51:58] he wanted to kill the anointed one which
[52:01] was david he was anointed to be the king
[52:03] of israel
[52:05] after saul
[52:06] that was the man after god's own heart
[52:10] but yet soul wanted to kill him
[52:13] and he didn't want to kill him with his
[52:15] hands he wanted to kill him with the
[52:17] hands of the philistines
[52:19] so he would send him to battles here and
[52:21] there and every time david would come
[52:23] back victorious and bringing you know
[52:26] trophies and everything and so saul
[52:29] tried to
[52:31] find a way to kill him and every scheme
[52:34] that he figured out it failed
[52:37] so
[52:38] the bible says that
[52:40] then after a while he decided
[52:44] to use his own daughter as a trap
[52:47] he used michael
[52:49] he he told david that if he slew
[52:53] the philistines he would give michael to
[52:55] him for a wife
[52:57] but
[52:58] it was supposed to be a trap
[53:02] amen
[53:05] so he used michael as a trap as a
[53:07] scandalon as an offense and we'll see
[53:10] what that means after a while so that
[53:12] was a mousetrap and david was supposed
[53:15] to be killed
[53:17] by the hands of the philistines
[53:19] because of the trap that was set
[53:22] so
[53:23] michael
[53:24] finally became
[53:26] david's wife but she wasn't the beloved
[53:28] wife of david
[53:30] you know and she was the daughter of
[53:31] saul that's how the scripture describes
[53:33] her because she was the the daughter of
[53:36] a man who was offended
[53:38] many times by the fact
[53:40] that david was better than him that that
[53:42] david was chosen over him
[53:45] so was offended so was offended when he
[53:48] heard the song that was being sung in
[53:50] those days
[53:52] because they had one song it was you
[53:55] know it had one verse that saul
[53:58] killed his thousand and it was a good
[54:00] song you know they they they sang it
[54:02] over and over and over again but then
[54:06] david came along you know he started to
[54:08] be victorious he was anointed he was
[54:10] filled he was chosen
[54:12] and they then they added another verse
[54:15] the people did
[54:18] they didn't erase the first one they
[54:20] just added another one right
[54:22] which would make the song up to date
[54:25] because there was david you know so they
[54:27] then they sang that saul killed his
[54:30] thousand but david killed his tens of
[54:33] thousands
[54:34] amen so that was another verse that they
[54:36] edit and saul didn't like that he was
[54:39] offended
[54:41] by that new song
[54:43] amen
[54:46] and we see michael she was the daughter
[54:48] of soul so that means that she was still
[54:50] under his authority
[54:52] although she was
[54:54] david's wife
[54:55] so meaning that she was supposed to take
[54:57] david's authority or david's hatship
[55:01] she was still under saul's authority
[55:04] amen so
[55:06] we see the story here we see that the
[55:08] word was coming back to jerusalem we see
[55:11] david who was rejoicing after you know
[55:13] he tried to bring the the ark of the
[55:16] covenant the first time it didn't work
[55:18] out he learned his lesson and now
[55:20] he did it the right way according to the
[55:22] word of god
[55:24] according to how it was supposed to be
[55:27] handled he brought the ark and he was
[55:28] rejoicing he was dancing because he knew
[55:31] that the ark of the covenant the word
[55:34] would be coming back to jerusalem amen
[55:36] so he was rejoice rejoicing
[55:39] and michael was not with him there are a
[55:41] lot of people there but michael was not
[55:43] one of them she was just watching from
[55:45] her window
[55:47] the window of her
[55:48] palace she was there and she watched the
[55:50] entire procession you know she took no
[55:53] part in it she just watched and judged
[55:56] from her window criticized had her
[55:59] opinion got offended
[56:01] amen
[56:02] she watched the word being restored she
[56:04] watched her husband acting in a way
[56:08] which wasn't a king-like way it wasn't
[56:11] something that a king was supposed to do
[56:15] amen
[56:18] so she criticized him in her heart
[56:21] his dance
[56:22] his actions
[56:25] and also the song that he wrote for that
[56:27] occasion
[56:28] which is found in psalms 24
[56:31] 9 and 10 lift up your heads o e gates
[56:35] even lift them up the everlasting doors
[56:38] and the king of glory shall come in
[56:41] who is the king of glory the lord of
[56:44] hosts he is the king of glory selah hey
[56:47] man but she she didn't like the song
[56:51] because she was saul's daughter she
[56:52] remembered the old song you know
[56:55] that the song they used to sing in her
[56:57] father's house
[56:59] the good old song the hymns and
[57:01] everything and she didn't understand the
[57:03] new song she didn't understand the
[57:05] meaning of the words
[57:08] who is the king of glory
[57:11] why is it important that he was supposed
[57:13] to come
[57:17] she didn't understand the restoration of
[57:19] the
[57:20] of the word
[57:21] she liked
[57:22] the old songs about how moses brought
[57:24] the children of israel out of egypt
[57:27] how they crossed the red sea and all of
[57:30] the wonderful testimonies you know the
[57:32] mana that came down she liked those
[57:34] songs
[57:35] she didn't like the current songs that
[57:38] expressed the revelation of the hour
[57:42] she didn't
[57:43] because she wasn't part of the bryce
[57:45] revival that's that's why she didn't
[57:47] that's that's very simple if you are
[57:48] part of a revival then you've got
[57:51] nothing against songs that express
[57:54] your revival that expresses the state of
[57:57] your soul
[57:59] that express your inner being your
[58:01] thoughts
[58:02] and your revival praise the lord so she
[58:04] was offended
[58:07] she didn't expect
[58:09] to see
[58:10] her husband acting this way amen she was
[58:13] disappointed
[58:15] she was disappointed seeing the word in
[58:17] flesh
[58:18] she was disappointed
[58:21] seeing the word being restored restored
[58:23] to jerusalem coming back after all of
[58:26] these years of captivity being in the
[58:29] hands of the philistines then staying
[58:32] in in the house of a man who took care
[58:34] of it after all of these years the
[58:37] people were rejoicing they they knew
[58:40] that the presence of the lord would be
[58:41] coming back to jerusalem but she
[58:44] didn't understand it
[58:46] amen so we see
[58:49] who stood in the window
[58:52] seeing the word being restored but then
[58:55] she
[58:56] turned her back she walked inside she
[58:58] asked her musicians
[59:01] to play that old song
[59:04] saul
[59:06] killed his thousand
[59:08] she liked that old song
[59:10] she didn't want anything to do with that
[59:12] revival
[59:13] she she she believed she was the an
[59:16] israelite she was king's daughter and
[59:18] everything but she didn't like the word
[59:20] in flesh
[59:22] amen
[59:23] therefore michael this the daughter of
[59:25] saul had no child until the day of her
[59:28] death
[59:29] amen
[59:31] so people are not offended by logos they
[59:34] are offended by kinos
[59:36] amen and it repeats over and over and
[59:38] over again amen
[59:41] we see another woman
[59:43] who also had her window and was looking
[59:45] from that window
[59:47] and that woman
[59:49] was the wife of a great man of a friend
[59:52] of god abraham and the woman was sarah
[59:55] amen but the difference between michael
[59:58] and sarah is that sarah she was not the
[1:00:02] daughter of the father of in law of
[1:00:04] abraham but she was the wife of abraham
[1:00:08] amen that was the difference you know
[1:00:10] and she called her husband lord
[1:00:14] and but it came to a time
[1:00:17] in her life in their life where there
[1:00:19] was no evidence of a revival there was
[1:00:22] no evidence no proof that the word of
[1:00:25] god was supposed to come to fruition
[1:00:27] come to manifestation in their lives
[1:00:30] so she became also bitter
[1:00:32] she became offended
[1:00:36] offended by things around her you know
[1:00:39] and right around tells us the story you
[1:00:42] know how one day
[1:00:44] abraham
[1:00:45] sat in front of his tent
[1:00:48] and he saw three men far off three
[1:00:51] strangers
[1:00:53] and he saw them and he ran to them and
[1:00:55] he asked them in he asked them he
[1:00:58] invited them to have fellowship with
[1:00:59] them
[1:01:01] so
[1:01:02] sarah was also there and barbara tells
[1:01:04] us what sarah thought
[1:01:07] she thought how many more fanatics will
[1:01:10] my husband entertain today
[1:01:12] these were her thoughts
[1:01:14] so she was bitter
[1:01:16] a bitter old lady she she didn't have
[1:01:20] any proof
[1:01:21] of being chosen of being blessed of
[1:01:23] being favored she had no son she had no
[1:01:26] evidence that's why she was bitter
[1:01:27] that's why she got offended quickly
[1:01:29] because that spirit was upon her
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:33] we see that she was offended by the
[1:01:35] strangers definitely she was offended by
[1:01:38] abraham by his behavior that he would
[1:01:40] entertain strangers all the time
[1:01:43] and he was
[1:01:44] you know
[1:01:46] and he
[1:01:47] she thought of of the people that came
[1:01:49] that they were fanatics
[1:01:51] you know but and but she did everything
[1:01:53] that she she had to she held with the
[1:01:56] meal but then she came back and went
[1:01:58] into her tent
[1:02:00] and there was also a window in the tent
[1:02:02] and she looked
[1:02:04] she watched these three strangers
[1:02:07] she she watched the word in human flesh
[1:02:10] she was her husband and she had her
[1:02:12] thoughts about it
[1:02:15] and the bible says
[1:02:17] that elohim said i will certainly return
[1:02:19] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:02:22] and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:02:26] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:02:28] which was behind him
[1:02:30] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[1:02:33] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[1:02:35] sarah after the manner of women
[1:02:38] therefore sarah laughed within her
[1:02:40] saying after i am wax old shall i have
[1:02:43] pleasure my lord being old also and the
[1:02:46] lord said unto abraham wherefore
[1:02:49] did sarah laugh saying shall i of a
[1:02:52] surety bear a child
[1:02:54] which i'm old
[1:02:55] so we know that god could have killed
[1:02:57] her at this point
[1:02:59] but the
[1:03:01] you know she wasn't a daughter of some
[1:03:03] man she was the wife of a person who was
[1:03:06] treated as a friend of god hey man
[1:03:08] that's why she couldn't be killed
[1:03:10] because she was identified with abraham
[1:03:13] and abraham was a friend of god he
[1:03:15] wasn't just some servant or somebody you
[1:03:19] know that god knew of he was the friend
[1:03:22] of god he he was actually the person
[1:03:25] that when elohim was supposed to destroy
[1:03:29] sodom and
[1:03:31] abraham was the one who was interceding
[1:03:33] for the people of sodom
[1:03:36] god said shall i hide away from my
[1:03:39] friend abraham
[1:03:41] that which i'm supposed to do he
[1:03:43] couldn't hide anything from abraham amen
[1:03:46] because he was a friend of god
[1:03:49] and
[1:03:50] sarah was a part of abraham
[1:03:53] that's why
[1:03:54] she couldn't be killed
[1:03:56] amen because she called him lord
[1:03:59] she knew her hatship she wasn't saul's
[1:04:01] daughter she was abraham's wife amen
[1:04:04] so that's all about being identified
[1:04:08] be identified
[1:04:10] as the lamb's wife don't be identified
[1:04:14] as saul's daughter of or a daughter of
[1:04:16] some direction or a daughter of some
[1:04:18] dynamic denomination some church
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:23] so what do you see looking out your
[1:04:25] window
[1:04:26] while you look through your window what
[1:04:28] do you see
[1:04:29] amen our windows we've got our eyes
[1:04:32] these are windows you know these are our
[1:04:35] thoughts you know
[1:04:36] we can watch something we can criticize
[1:04:39] we can think oh we like we can judge and
[1:04:41] everything what do you see from your
[1:04:43] window
[1:04:44] we've seen we've seen people who look
[1:04:47] through windows and judge the word
[1:04:50] we see michael who saw the restoration
[1:04:53] of the word coming to jerusalem coming
[1:04:55] back to the bride which is jerusalem
[1:04:58] and she had her opinion
[1:05:01] she had her judgment
[1:05:03] she had her critical spirit
[1:05:08] what do you think of jesus called the
[1:05:11] christ
[1:05:13] and the question was not what do you
[1:05:14] think of jehovah
[1:05:16] what do you think of the creator of
[1:05:18] the heavens and the earth but what do
[1:05:20] you think of jesus called the christ
[1:05:22] what do you think of the word becoming
[1:05:25] flesh what do you think of it
[1:05:28] what's your opinion are you offended
[1:05:32] hey man
[1:05:33] so people are offended
[1:05:36] not by logos but by kinos amen
[1:05:40] brabram says in the sermon lean not unto
[1:05:43] your own understanding 65 he says
[1:05:46] blessed is he who is not offended in me
[1:05:48] quoting the scripture he says so many
[1:05:51] have been offended
[1:05:52] so many people get offended so easily at
[1:05:55] the word of god
[1:05:58] it's contrary they want to lean to their
[1:06:00] own understanding
[1:06:02] they don't want to take the word of the
[1:06:03] lord
[1:06:05] and they have to go just the way
[1:06:08] that they have been taught
[1:06:10] and the way that they were taught their
[1:06:12] church leans upon it no matter if god
[1:06:15] promised he would he would rain have
[1:06:18] rain in the morning the church said
[1:06:20] that's nonsense
[1:06:22] they would believe the church instead of
[1:06:23] god because why
[1:06:27] because they are born of the church
[1:06:30] but a man that's born of god
[1:06:32] is of the seed of god and the the seed
[1:06:36] of god is the word of god and he only
[1:06:38] lives
[1:06:39] by that that's his life
[1:06:42] amen so there is a difference between
[1:06:45] somebody who leans on the understanding
[1:06:47] of the church and who is of the seed of
[1:06:50] god
[1:06:52] seed of god which is the word of god and
[1:06:55] he only lives by that amen
[1:06:58] so
[1:06:59] what we've read is blessed is he
[1:07:02] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[1:07:05] that's these are the words of jesus
[1:07:08] amen and jesus did not say blessed is he
[1:07:11] who shall not be offended by my
[1:07:14] disciples
[1:07:16] blessed is he
[1:07:18] who shall not be offended
[1:07:20] by my church
[1:07:22] by the members of my church
[1:07:25] that's not what jesus said amen but he
[1:07:29] said
[1:07:30] that the challenge is
[1:07:32] blessed is he who is not offended of me
[1:07:35] of the word
[1:07:37] amen praise the lord
[1:07:39] of the word not the logos but the word
[1:07:42] and flesh
[1:07:43] the manifestation of the word amen we
[1:07:46] see judas he was offended by the woman
[1:07:49] that came to jesus
[1:07:52] with the oil with the perfume
[1:07:55] he was offended by her action he was
[1:07:57] offended also by the reaction of jesus
[1:08:01] he didn't understand that
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:07] and during the last supper
[1:08:08] we know that christ told them
[1:08:11] this night you all shall be offended
[1:08:14] because of me
[1:08:15] wow what a statement
[1:08:18] no why because they had they all had
[1:08:21] their expectations because they were not
[1:08:22] converted jesus said to peter when you
[1:08:25] are converted go strengthen my brothers
[1:08:28] he was not converted and so
[1:08:30] other disciples they were not converted
[1:08:32] they they weren't changed their thinking
[1:08:34] was not changed that's why they had
[1:08:36] expectations of jesus that he would
[1:08:38] never fulfill
[1:08:41] they had their own thoughts
[1:08:44] and jesus said
[1:08:46] that this night you shall all be
[1:08:48] offended nothing of what you expected of
[1:08:51] me will come to pass
[1:08:53] you will be disappointed in me in my
[1:08:55] ministry
[1:08:58] this night amen
[1:09:00] and we see what happened after jesus
[1:09:02] died we see the disciples on the road to
[1:09:05] emmaus we see how they were disappointed
[1:09:08] you know
[1:09:09] they
[1:09:10] they would say that they had great great
[1:09:12] expectations of the ministry of jesus
[1:09:16] that never came to pass
[1:09:18] we see peter who after jesus died he
[1:09:20] went fishing he came back
[1:09:23] to to where he came from you know he was
[1:09:26] also
[1:09:27] offended
[1:09:30] because his expectations were not met
[1:09:32] amen and we see in our times we see
[1:09:35] elohim
[1:09:37] comes to the chosen seat of abraham
[1:09:40] we see the temple being rebuilt
[1:09:43] we see the vision of joseph coming to
[1:09:45] pass
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:47] praise the lord
[1:09:48] we see the word coming back to jerusalem
[1:09:52] we see all of these things
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:56] and then shall many be offended and
[1:09:58] shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:10:00] one another amen one of the of the signs
[1:10:03] of the end time
[1:10:06] amen matthew 24
[1:10:08] but it's all because of the ministry of
[1:10:11] the third pool
[1:10:12] as all because of the word coming in
[1:10:16] flesh coming in manifestation that's why
[1:10:19] people get offended they would never be
[1:10:21] offended by just reading a quote or
[1:10:24] reading the scripture but when they see
[1:10:26] it being manifested in you and i that's
[1:10:28] when they when they get offended amen
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:36] many therefore of his disciples
[1:10:40] when they heard that
[1:10:43] they said this is a hard saying who can
[1:10:46] hear it
[1:10:47] when jesus knew in himself that his
[1:10:49] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:10:52] them does that offend you
[1:10:55] what and if you shall see the son of man
[1:10:57] ascend up where he was before
[1:11:00] amen so they were offended by what he
[1:11:03] said and jesus said
[1:11:05] that offends you there is more coming
[1:11:09] there is a greater unveiling there is a
[1:11:11] greater manifestation of the word coming
[1:11:13] and you're offended by that
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:17] amen praise the lord people are not
[1:11:19] offended by the logos
[1:11:21] but when they see the word walking on
[1:11:24] two feet that's when they are offended
[1:11:27] amen praise the lord let's stand
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:32] so the word in flesh
[1:11:34] always offends the people
[1:11:38] it is always offensive to others when
[1:11:40] they see somebody who has lifted their
[1:11:42] position
[1:11:44] it's an offense to them
[1:11:46] hey ma'am
[1:11:48] but the bride is returning to where she
[1:11:50] originally came from amen she's coming
[1:11:53] to her position
[1:11:55] she's coming to fruition to
[1:11:57] manifestation hey man
[1:12:00] to the time where she was before the
[1:12:02] foundation of the world
[1:12:03] amen and we we saw the pharisees
[1:12:07] they had a very
[1:12:09] spiritual expectation of jesus
[1:12:13] they thought it all spiritual you know
[1:12:15] that the the the heavens would open up
[1:12:18] and there would be some great light
[1:12:20] coming down but they didn't expect the
[1:12:23] word to come to manifestation in that
[1:12:26] way
[1:12:27] so they were actually not offended by
[1:12:29] by the
[1:12:30] the divine part of christ but they were
[1:12:33] offended by the physical the natural
[1:12:35] part of christ
[1:12:37] they were offended by his flesh
[1:12:41] that was the stumbling block
[1:12:44] they liked his teaching
[1:12:47] to a point
[1:12:49] they call him the good rabbi good
[1:12:51] teacher
[1:12:52] you're a good teacher
[1:12:54] but what about your disciples what about
[1:12:56] you coming you know
[1:12:58] and healing in the sabbath you know
[1:13:00] performing
[1:13:02] miracles you know like spitting on the
[1:13:05] ground and making mud what's that all
[1:13:07] about
[1:13:08] is that part of being messiah they
[1:13:10] couldn't understand that they were
[1:13:11] offended by that
[1:13:13] and the people would say you claim to be
[1:13:15] god
[1:13:16] you know
[1:13:19] jesus never claimed to be god
[1:13:21] it's always
[1:13:22] satan who claims to be god
[1:13:25] jesus he didn't have to claim to be god
[1:13:27] he was god
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] in very nature he was god
[1:13:32] paul tells us amen praise the lord
[1:13:35] so what do you see
[1:13:37] when you look through your window what
[1:13:39] do you see when you see the word
[1:13:43] in action
[1:13:44] when you see the word being materialized
[1:13:47] what do you think of it
[1:13:49] what do you think about jehovah what do
[1:13:51] you think about the creator of the
[1:13:53] universe what do you think of the god in
[1:13:55] times of brother branham what do you
[1:13:57] think of god performing his work today
[1:14:02] and the people that he chose
[1:14:05] in the flesh that he chose to dwell in
[1:14:08] amen what do you see
[1:14:10] in the last
[1:14:11] scripture
[1:14:13] psalm 119 it says i rejoice at thy word
[1:14:16] as one that findeth great spoil i hate
[1:14:19] and abhor lying thy law do i love
[1:14:23] seven times a day do i praise thee
[1:14:26] because of thy righteous judgments
[1:14:28] great peace
[1:14:30] have
[1:14:31] they which left the law and nothing
[1:14:33] shall offend them
[1:14:35] nothing shall offend them there is a
[1:14:37] people that choose not to be offended by
[1:14:41] anything that god brings their way
[1:14:43] by anything that they see
[1:14:45] you know it many times we see the word
[1:14:48] being manifested and we need to check
[1:14:50] our own thinking our own uh
[1:14:53] you know thoughts about it our own
[1:14:55] interpretation and expectations do they
[1:14:58] match the word that's why we need to
[1:15:00] always come back to the word
[1:15:02] does it match with the word
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] praise the lord praise the lord for that
[1:15:09] group of people who will not be offended
[1:15:13] amen

[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:12] is
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:48] oh
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:54] oh praise god i was edified by the word
[1:18:57] how about you
[1:18:59] amen may we never be one that looks out
[1:19:02] the window
[1:19:03] to criticize that the word made flesh
[1:19:07] like uh michael did
[1:19:09] when she looked she didn't want what
[1:19:11] david was rejoicing about
[1:19:14] amen but how many of you when you see
[1:19:16] the bride's revival you want to get down
[1:19:18] there and dance with david amen when you
[1:19:20] see the bride coming of christ what god
[1:19:22] is doing today how he's coming in the
[1:19:24] flesh of his bride amen and he's
[1:19:26] revealed his word and he's given the
[1:19:28] full revelation to his bride how many of
[1:19:30] you want to get down and dance a little
[1:19:32] bit with david
[1:19:33] and shout and say thank you god for eyes
[1:19:36] to see and ears to hear thank you that
[1:19:38] your word has come back to jerusalem
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] remember you know as he was speaking
[1:19:45] there about john the baptist sending his
[1:19:47] disciples
[1:19:49] john was in prison and his eagle eyes
[1:19:51] filmed over
[1:19:53] and it was the issue of expectation like
[1:19:56] he said before because even john giving
[1:19:58] the prophecy had an expectation of how
[1:20:00] it would be fulfilled and jesus christ
[1:20:02] didn't match john's
[1:20:04] expectation
[1:20:06] so in prison he asked are you the one or
[1:20:08] we seek another that's why jesus said
[1:20:11] blessed is he who is not offended in me
[1:20:13] and brother branham let us know blessed
[1:20:15] is he who's not offended in the way that
[1:20:17] i come amen and the way that i fulfill
[1:20:19] the word
[1:20:21] i just like to go on record saying i'm
[1:20:23] not offended in the way he has fulfilled
[1:20:26] his promised word
[1:20:27] at the end time
[1:20:29] i'm looking out the window and i'm
[1:20:31] saying that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:20:34] that's beautiful picture that i see
[1:20:36] it's god
[1:20:38] coming in the flesh of his bride
[1:20:40] to manifest
[1:20:42] amen his plan for the end time
[1:20:45] let it warm our hearts
[1:20:47] not create an offense
[1:20:49] and if you can rejoice like david
[1:20:51] rejoice if you look out your window and
[1:20:53] you said that's a beautiful sign then
[1:20:55] that's the grace of god in our lives we
[1:20:57] should rejoice we should sing we should
[1:20:59] dance we should be happy because that's
[1:21:01] the grace of god in our lives
[1:21:04] amen may god be with you as we go and
[1:21:07] remember our brother samuel keep praying
[1:21:09] for him he's traveling from here to
[1:21:11] phoenix to preach there and then he'll
[1:21:13] be traveling back home

[1:21:17] as he's traveling around let him get
[1:21:19] back home safely and join his family
[1:21:22] amen god bless you and let's just bow
[1:21:23] our heads and pray as we're dismissed
[1:21:25] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:21:29] and god i pray that our eagle eye would
[1:21:32] never get filmed over lord
[1:21:34] may we never lose sight lord of what
[1:21:36] you're doing and may we never be
[1:21:38] offended in the way that you do it lord
[1:21:41] for god you have come lord and done
[1:21:43] exactly what you promised you would do
[1:21:45] and you're fulfilling it now
[1:21:48] your word is being fleshed lord fleshed
[1:21:51] out all around us
