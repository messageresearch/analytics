[17:56] announce that again at the end of
[17:57] service uh while we're standing let's
[17:59] turn to the Book of
[18:06] Genesis Genesis chapter
[18:15] 1 in Genesis CH 1 we'll read verse 26-
[18:24] 28 and God said let us make man in our
[18:27] image after our likeness and let them
[18:29] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[18:31] and over the foul of the air and over
[18:33] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[18:35] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[18:36] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[18:39] own image in the image of God created he
[18:41] him male and female created he them and
[18:45] God blessed them and God said unto them
[18:47] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[18:49] the Earth and subdue it and have
[18:51] dominion over the fish of the Sea and
[18:53] the foul of the air and over every
[18:55] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[18:58] amen let's bow our heads together and
[19:00] pray dear heavenly father we thank you
[19:03] Jesus that you have brought us together
[19:05] again and we're once again so grateful
[19:08] Lord for this privilege this opportunity
[19:11] you've granted us to come and worship
[19:13] you together with our brothers and
[19:14] sisters to hear your word and God may
[19:17] you just come and take control now take
[19:20] absolute control over this vessel of
[19:22] mine God I want to yield as much as I
[19:25] know how into your hand so that you can
[19:27] speak through a gift you've placed in a
[19:29] vessel of clay God we have no confidence
[19:32] in the flesh but we have confidence in
[19:33] your method your way your word so we
[19:36] come in obedience to that God we're
[19:39] aware of the frailties we're aware of
[19:41] all the pitfalls and handicaps that is
[19:43] in flesh but yet this is your method and
[19:46] we trust it Lord God we trust that
[19:48] you'll keep us by your grace that you'll
[19:50] feed us as your lambs and we've come to
[19:52] receive that word Lord that portion for
[19:55] today May you feed us may you make
[19:57] yourself evident through the the
[19:58] breaking of bread may you give us
[20:00] strength for our journey we love you we
[20:03] ask that you bless us now in Jesus
[20:05] Christ's name we pray amen and God bless
[20:08] you as you have your
[20:10] seats praise the Lord so I've got on my
[20:13] heart a big subject I've been meditating
[20:16] on and I've got I I'm I'm really full
[20:18] and I don't think we'll get through it
[20:19] all today and it may be a couple parts
[20:22] but we'll just see how it goes um but
[20:25] I'd like to to speak on the subject the
[20:27] unveiling of the the amateur Gods the
[20:30] unveiling of the amateur gods and that's
[20:32] quite a mouthful for a title but I hope
[20:35] God will help us just to uh break it
[20:37] down and and and just demonstrate what's
[20:39] on our heart and so uh I want to read a
[20:43] a quote out of the breach the breach
[20:46] message when brother Benham come to
[20:47] preach the seals he starts with God
[20:50] hiding himself in Simplicity and
[20:51] revealing himself in the same then he
[20:53] comes to the breach between the seven
[20:55] Church ages and the Seven Seals and in
[20:57] the breach he says and when he lost his
[20:59] life he also lost in his inheritance in
[21:03] life he's speaking of Adam now because
[21:05] he had completely Supreme control of the
[21:07] earth he was a god of the earth God's
[21:10] the god of the universe everywhere but
[21:12] his son had this Earth under his own
[21:14] control he could speak he could name he
[21:17] could say he could stop nature he could
[21:19] do anything he wanted to see but when he
[21:21] did that he lost his inheritance now
[21:24] Adam could say let this mountain here be
[21:26] moved over there and it would do it Adam
[21:29] could say let this tree here be plucked
[21:31] up and planted over there it would do it
[21:33] for he had complete Supreme control as a
[21:36] minor God under God our father because
[21:38] he was a Son of God Amen so because he
[21:41] was a Son of God he was a minor God and
[21:44] brother Brenham uses the term and we'll
[21:45] get to it in a minute amateur God so
[21:48] amateur God or minor God and he uses
[21:50] them uh interchangeably these terms but
[21:54] but you know uh hold on I just want to
[21:56] write something down here before it
[21:57] leaves my mind
[21:59] you know brother brandom said uh 25
[22:01] years ago he goes I used to hold those
[22:02] scriptures in my mind just go right
[22:04] through them but now I got to write well
[22:05] now I can't even hold it for 5 minutes
[22:08] anymore so I just got to stop and write
[22:10] it
[22:13] around amen so I used to just ignore
[22:17] that and think oh it'll come back but
[22:19] I'm I realized I can't ignore that the
[22:22] curse of age is still real
[22:24] amen so now he he says he's a uh a minor
[22:29] God under God our father because he was
[22:31] a Son of God so the that's the position
[22:34] of the sons of God would to be minor
[22:37] gods or children of God and we've been
[22:39] through this exercise before uh any
[22:42] child any offspring of a species is the
[22:45] same species so The Offspring of a dog
[22:48] is a dog The Offspring of a cat is a cat
[22:50] what is The Offspring of
[22:52] God amen amen that's why the Bible calls
[22:55] us children of God children of light all
[22:58] of the these things because we we are
[23:00] intended to be the the children of God
[23:02] and that's what Adam was and as the
[23:04] first Son of God that was created in
[23:06] this creation here in Genesis he
[23:09] demonstrated what it was to be a Son of
[23:11] God he was G he was placed in a position
[23:14] of dominion he was told to have dominion
[23:16] and subdue the Earth and all creation
[23:19] and bring it under his Dominion because
[23:21] he was a king he was a god upon the
[23:24] Earth amen so let's go to Genesis
[23:27] chapter 2 now
[23:30] now Genesis
[23:34] 2 verse
[23:38] 15 Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took
[23:41] the man and put him into the Garden of
[23:42] Eden to dress it and to keep it and the
[23:45] Lord God commanded the man saying of
[23:47] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[23:48] freely eat but of the tree of the
[23:50] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[23:52] not eat of it for in the day that you
[23:54] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and
[23:58] the Lord God God said unto said it is
[24:00] not good that man shall be alone I will
[24:02] make him a help meat for him and out of
[24:05] the ground the Lord God formed every
[24:06] beast of the field and every foul of the
[24:08] air and brought them unto Adam to see
[24:10] what he would call them and whatsoever
[24:13] Adam called every living creature that
[24:15] was the name thereof and Adam gave names
[24:18] to all the cattle and to the foul of the
[24:20] air and to every beast of the field but
[24:22] for Adam there was not found a help
[24:24] meate for him so we find in the nature
[24:28] of Adam as the Son of God as the god
[24:31] over the Earth he was he was uh going to
[24:34] be formed in the likeness of God in the
[24:36] image of God and we know as the prophet
[24:38] taught us he started off in in a spirit
[24:41] form and then the spirit was made into a
[24:43] flesh form so he could interact with the
[24:45] creation because he was going to be a
[24:47] God over that creation so he came into
[24:49] the form of the creation so they could
[24:51] interact with their God and and now uh
[24:55] God is going to find a help meat for him
[24:57] so what he does is he brings up every
[24:59] creature out of the earth and brings
[25:01] them and presents them to Adam and now
[25:03] Adam is naming the creatures it's not
[25:06] it's not God naming the creatures is
[25:08] Adam naming the creatures because Adam
[25:09] is the god of the
[25:11] earth so we see the Dominion that he has
[25:14] we see we we also see the the um we also
[25:19] see the uh the confidence that God has
[25:22] in his son as God brings every animal to
[25:24] Adam to name and whatever Adam named him
[25:27] that was the name that thereof so this
[25:29] is a big statement now we realize when
[25:31] we read the Bible we we've been through
[25:33] this so many times cuz the prophet of
[25:35] God unlocks the the Bible for us he says
[25:37] God condenses his truth I mean he packs
[25:39] it in but it means so much every little
[25:42] word every jot every TT amen it's packed
[25:45] full of meaning amen so that's why he
[25:47] told us we have to read between the
[25:48] lines or we have to catch the context or
[25:50] or he said sometimes put on your
[25:52] spiritual jackets I mean he wants us to
[25:54] pay attention to everything here and so
[25:57] when whatever Adam Nam to animals that
[25:59] was the name
[26:00] thereof meaning that whatever he had the
[26:04] authority to declare what this is to
[26:08] Define what this is and a name is more
[26:11] than just a name it's also a
[26:14] placing right all right so so Adam would
[26:17] have to know uh uh I would he we know
[26:21] Adam was a prophet he lays down a
[26:23] prophecy and when a man leaves his
[26:24] father and mother and Cleaves to his
[26:26] wife that was a prophecy and so we know
[26:28] he's a Son of God he his prophetic
[26:30] insight and now he's naming all the
[26:32] animals and and it's not just I don't I
[26:36] don't perceive it this way that the
[26:37] naming of animals was just trivial
[26:39] whatever you know whatever whim he got
[26:41] but he was actually placing creation as
[26:44] he was naming the animals he was he was
[26:47] naming them according to characteristics
[26:49] that they possessed and and in naming
[26:51] them according to the C characteristics
[26:52] he identify he was positionally placing
[26:55] them so he was the god of the earth
[26:57] placing the
[26:59] creation amen and God had this
[27:02] confidence in his son to do that and so
[27:04] he would have to do it with prophetic
[27:06] Insight he would have to do it knowing
[27:08] the mind of God because he would have to
[27:10] be in the nature of God to place it the
[27:13] way God wanted it place because he can't
[27:15] get it out of kilter according to God's
[27:17] word which is original
[27:19] thought amen so we see this is a mighty
[27:22] position that Adam's in it's not trivial
[27:25] it's not light-hearted it's not asking a
[27:27] 5-year-old what you want to call this or
[27:29] what do you want to name your your puppy
[27:31] it's not that kind of
[27:33] naming all right and so then there was a
[27:37] help meet found for him which we know is
[27:39] foreshadowing the the whole Plan of
[27:41] Redemption where where the the his bride
[27:43] was in him and came out from him and was
[27:45] United back together but we want to talk
[27:48] about this now he is in the realm of the
[27:52] word operating as God over the Earth
[27:55] he's an amateur God or a minor God under
[27:58] his father God cuz he's a Son of God and
[28:01] he's in position and everything's in
[28:03] position and everything's held in
[28:05] position as long as the Son of God stays
[28:09] with the word of God but it began to
[28:11] lose its position when the Son of God
[28:14] left the word of God so it goes to show
[28:17] amen that if I could if I could just
[28:20] share what's on my heart because I don't
[28:21] even know how to explain it all we're
[28:23] just trusting in God to help amen it
[28:25] shows that we we can make big claims and
[28:29] boastful claims that we're the children
[28:31] of God we're the sons of God we're this
[28:33] and we're the bride and we're that but
[28:35] but you realized that even a Son of God
[28:38] when he left the word of God Amen was
[28:41] was knocked out of his position as a
[28:43] minor
[28:44] God he didn't keep that position just
[28:48] because he was a Son of God he kept that
[28:50] position because he was a Son of God
[28:52] staying behind the word of God and even
[28:55] when the Son of God left the word of God
[28:58] he lost his position right amen so this
[29:01] is really important because the day and
[29:03] the age that we live in amen because of
[29:05] the tremendous Revelation that came to
[29:07] us if we get the wrong thinking behind
[29:10] that revelation we start to believe that
[29:13] that we are children of God and sons of
[29:15] God and that's wonderful to believe we
[29:16] need to receive that Revelation but if
[29:19] that Revelation puts us in a position to
[29:21] where we can ignore work around reject
[29:25] the word of God we may still be some and
[29:28] Daughters of God but we are not going to
[29:30] be in our position that God has called
[29:32] us to in this day we'll be knocked out
[29:35] like Adam was knocked
[29:37] out now although Adam was knocked out of
[29:40] position amen he was still a Son of God
[29:43] and God came down himself as the father
[29:45] and offered a lamb to pay the price of
[29:46] redemption and clothed him in the
[29:48] clothes Amen to start the work of
[29:50] restoration amen so it wasn't as though
[29:52] he he was no longer a Son of God but he
[29:54] was now a fallen Son of God outside of
[29:57] his position and no no longer an amateur
[30:00] God but he was still a Son of
[30:03] God and so we're finding all the way
[30:06] back from the
[30:07] beginning how critical it is to stay
[30:11] with God's
[30:12] word he's from the very from the very
[30:15] word go he starts off with this this
[30:17] whole premise that we must stay with the
[30:20] word that our our our staying in
[30:22] position amen has to do with staying in
[30:25] position with the word
[30:28] amen Amen brother B says in the message
[30:31] adoption from 1960 he said the word
[30:33] means in Hebrew the self-existent all by
[30:36] himself nothing exists before him he was
[30:38] the all existent there ever was
[30:39] self-existent one Ella Ella Elohim means
[30:44] the all sufficient all powerful
[30:45] allmighty self-existent one but in
[30:48] Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am
[30:52] Jehova uh uh yeah Jehovah what did he
[30:55] mean I am the all existent one who has
[30:58] created something off of myself to be a
[31:00] son of mine or a temporary or an amateur
[31:03] little one of
[31:04] mine so he's showing now in the
[31:07] transition of titles Amen brother
[31:09] brandom if you understand what he's
[31:11] saying here he's not actually giving you
[31:13] an accurate definition like you would go
[31:16] to the concordance and get a definition
[31:18] and he's not even uh declaring it uh uh
[31:20] I I could say this way in the sequence
[31:22] of events what he's giving you is the
[31:24] overarching understanding that was
[31:26] Elohim the self-existing and God who
[31:28] dwelt all alone but when he began to
[31:30] bring Offspring upon the Earth amen he
[31:32] changed now he's the S Jehovah means the
[31:35] self-existent one amen who reveals
[31:37] himself amen and so now as he's bringing
[31:40] Sons upon the Earth amen he he's he's
[31:42] displaying uh more attributes of himself
[31:46] amen he's unveiling himself and here's
[31:48] how the prophet says it he says uh I am
[31:51] the all existing one who has created
[31:53] something off myself to be a son of mine
[31:57] you can't find in the
[32:00] concordance that's not what it says in
[32:02] the concordance but that's exactly what
[32:03] it is that's the reality of the
[32:06] Revelation behind what you find in the
[32:08] concordance see this is what a prophet
[32:11] can do especially a prophet with only a
[32:12] seventh grade
[32:14] education because he doesn't have to
[32:16] stay
[32:17] hindered by intellectual methods of
[32:20] having a proper uh
[32:23] definition or even Hebrew and all of
[32:25] that Amen brother B goes to the Hebrew
[32:27] goes to the Greek he does all of that
[32:29] because what's he trying to do he's
[32:30] trying to find out the meaning behind it
[32:33] the understanding not just the
[32:35] definition but the
[32:37] understanding so that's what he's
[32:39] bringing us here I'm the all- existent
[32:41] one who has created something off of
[32:43] myself to be a son of mine or a
[32:45] temporary amateur little one of mine
[32:47] that's what brother B say is the
[32:48] definition of
[32:52] Jehovah amen you get in a discussion
[32:54] with a theologian and you start quoting
[32:56] your definition he's going to look at
[32:57] you like like where did you get
[33:00] that amen so he's showing that God
[33:04] wanted to unveil himself he would he
[33:06] wanted to be more than just the
[33:08] self-existing one who dwelt
[33:10] alone amen so he created something off
[33:13] of himself to be a son of his or an
[33:17] amateur little one of
[33:19] mine he gave man Jehovah means that he
[33:22] gave man to be an amateur God because he
[33:25] is Father God and he made man an amate
[33:28] God so he isn't self-existence anymore
[33:31] he exists with his family amen Ella
[33:35] Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah
[33:38] meaning the one who exists with his
[33:40] family there's another definition
[33:42] Jehovah means the one who exist with his
[33:45] family amen praise God also not in the
[33:48] concordance if you take the intellectual
[33:51] understanding but when the eyes of your
[33:52] faith are open and you go to concordance
[33:54] you're like I see what it means that's
[33:56] exactly right brother benam
[33:58] amen the one who exists with his family
[34:01] now God made man to be the predominant
[34:04] over all the Earth he had dominion and
[34:06] the Earth was man's Dominion is that
[34:09] scripture then if that's his Dominion he
[34:11] was a God over the Earth he could speak
[34:13] and it would be so he could speak this
[34:15] and it would be so and there he is god
[34:18] Jehovah the one the the one who once
[34:21] existed in self-existence but now exist
[34:23] with his family and his little ones with
[34:26] him there you are Amen brother said
[34:29] God's original desire was to have an
[34:31] earth inhabited with sons and
[34:33] daughters and those Sons and Daughters
[34:36] would all be the children of God and
[34:38] they would all be uh operate in a
[34:41] operation of the word by faith in the
[34:43] word amen and they would be Gods upon
[34:46] the
[34:46] Earth having dominion and so let's go
[34:50] back to Genesis 2 verse
[34:52] one Genesis 2 verse1
[34:59] says thus the heavens and the Earth were
[35:01] finished and all the hosts of them and
[35:03] on the seventh day God ended his work
[35:05] which he had made and he rested on the
[35:07] seventh day from all his work which he
[35:09] had made and God blessed the seventh day
[35:12] and Sanctified it because that in it he
[35:14] had rested from all his work which he
[35:16] had created and made brother M because
[35:19] and gives us so much Insight on the word
[35:21] he says why was it that God rested on
[35:23] the seventh day because on the seventh
[35:25] day he turned Dominion of his creation
[35:28] over to his son and his son's wife and
[35:31] that's why God went and took his rest
[35:33] because now he had reflected himself in
[35:37] a son upon the Earth and that son was a
[35:39] minor God or an amateur God underneath
[35:42] father God and he had God had made a
[35:45] creation upon the Earth and then he had
[35:47] placed a portion of himself on that
[35:49] Earth in flesh and that was Adam and he
[35:51] had given dominion and rulership and
[35:53] Reign unto Adam so now because God had a
[35:56] reflection of him himself on Earth
[35:58] keeping everything according to the word
[36:01] he could go and and rest because now his
[36:03] son was in
[36:04] charge praise God Amen but W brother man
[36:09] said while he was
[36:11] resting so in the seventh day while he
[36:13] was resting there was a deception that
[36:15] came up and the woman was beguiled by
[36:17] the serpent she was deceived and it's
[36:20] amazing the terminology that the serpent
[36:22] uses because he starts to ask questions
[36:24] about the word hey yeah has God said you
[36:26] may eat of all the trees and she says
[36:28] yeah we can eat of them all except this
[36:29] one of the knowledge of the tree of Good
[36:31] and Evil and forgive me I'm just
[36:32] paraphrasing but he he he said that uh
[36:35] he says uh but no that's not true he
[36:38] said God does know said you'll not
[36:40] surely die but God does know in that day
[36:43] you eat thereof that day you should be
[36:45] as Gods knowing good and
[36:48] evil and it's so sad but he tried to
[36:52] sell them something that they didn't
[36:55] need cuz they were already Gods upon the
[36:59] Earth but he was trying to give them
[37:02] another position or a higher position or
[37:04] something else showed them that there
[37:06] was more to attain to something that
[37:08] you're limited in now this understanding
[37:10] if you have this understanding you'll be
[37:12] as Gods upon the Earth knowing good and
[37:14] evil and that wasn't God's position for
[37:16] them to be God's knowing good and evil
[37:18] his position for them was to be God's
[37:20] knowing
[37:21] good why I told him to stay away from
[37:23] the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[37:25] but stay with the Tree of Life which
[37:27] which is
[37:28] good so so now he he begins to sell him
[37:31] this and she takes the word and takes
[37:34] the false word and leaves the word and
[37:35] as she leaves the word to fall and Adam
[37:38] knowing what he was doing but he goes to
[37:40] his wife out with his wife in order to
[37:42] save his wife he leaves the word when he
[37:44] left the word he lost his position as
[37:47] amateur
[37:48] God he still remained a Son of God but
[37:52] he lost his position as amateur God so
[37:55] so we find that's that was the case in
[37:58] the beginning brother bam in the message
[38:00] why says a man was made to be God to be
[38:03] a God so what was the original purpose
[38:06] in creation of man he was made to be a
[38:08] god do you know that he's in the image
[38:11] of God he's a Son of God he's like him
[38:13] he was given a do a domain Genesis 1:26
[38:16] dominion over the whole earth that's
[38:18] right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the
[38:20] animal kingdom and all the other
[38:22] kingdoms all but the kingdom of God
[38:24] above he was God he was an amateur God
[38:27] he was made in the image of God made
[38:29] like God had hands and feet like God he
[38:32] was in the image of
[38:34] God what happened because he disbelieved
[38:38] God's word it sent him right back out to
[38:41] shift for himself now listen now God's
[38:44] trying to bring him back amen what is
[38:48] the what what is the Plan of Redemption
[38:50] what is the whole Bible for it's to
[38:51] bring us back to this picture of
[38:54] Eden now God is trying to bring him back
[38:57] and when you have faith and accept him
[38:59] my brother just let that little light
[39:00] begin to grow out taking all the roots
[39:03] of doubt and bitterness yielding
[39:04] yourself to the spirit when you begin to
[39:06] become a Son of God a daughter of God
[39:08] begin to grow in the grace of God the
[39:10] Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom
[39:12] within you so now God is
[39:16] trying to bring him back man fell but
[39:19] God's trying to bring him back why did
[39:21] God leave his rest he left his rest amen
[39:24] because the work that he had done and
[39:25] completed was now fallen because left
[39:27] the word and now could no longer serve
[39:29] the original
[39:31] purpose so now he starts remaking his
[39:35] Masterpiece he starts working AO taking
[39:37] what had fallen down and he starts
[39:39] rebuilding again and he rebuilds to the
[39:41] Old Testament until he comes to that
[39:43] Capstone the head of the old which is
[39:45] Jesus Christ and flesh and then use the
[39:47] fullness of the word made bodily and
[39:49] then now from his side he takes a wife
[39:51] what's he doing he's reconstructing his
[39:53] Masterpiece family from the Garden of
[39:55] Eden and he's doing it through the
[39:57] entire scripture so that the whole
[39:59] scripture has one purpose one goal one
[40:01] desire that God wanted to achieve and
[40:04] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[40:06] bring his offspring back to their
[40:08] position as amateur Sons and Daughters
[40:10] of
[40:12] God
[40:14] Amen how has he done it through his
[40:17] never changing method by his word amen
[40:23] amen so now
[40:27] my this was history this was a history
[40:30] lesson now let's come up to
[40:33] today when he's when I'm looking at the
[40:35] unveiling of the sons of God when we
[40:37] know that God's Plan of Redemption was
[40:39] to bring Sons and Daughters of God back
[40:42] to their position as amateur gods or
[40:45] minor Gods we know that we live in the
[40:49] day that God is finishing his work of
[40:52] redemption we're in the last days
[40:54] brother I made it so clear this is the
[40:56] end time the seven seal is the end time
[40:58] seal it's the ending of all things said
[41:00] this is the end time and so he went from
[41:04] like we've been talking about for the
[41:05] last several weeks he went from saying
[41:06] is this the sign of the end
[41:08] s to start asking what time is it
[41:13] sir he started saying is this the sign
[41:16] of the end s good question but I he the
[41:19] question was satisfied for him but he
[41:20] still asked the question what time is it
[41:23] sir so you can draw your own
[41:25] conclusion amen
[41:27] let's go to John chapter 10
[41:36] now when we see the plan of God and when
[41:39] we take a uh like we say bird's eye view
[41:42] but if we leave the Earthly carnal
[41:44] things and we fly high into the
[41:46] heavenlies through the eagle anointing
[41:48] that's been presented in this day that
[41:50] can lift us up and we we're not looking
[41:52] at the forest with all the individual
[41:54] trees but we're now flying high to see
[41:56] the lands ape the whole landscape and
[41:58] how everything fits together amen we we
[42:01] realize what God had done originally
[42:03] what his original intent and purpose was
[42:05] in creating man where man fell for that
[42:07] what God has done to restore it and
[42:09] where God's taking men back to we've got
[42:11] this whole perspective of this whole
[42:13] image that came by the message of the
[42:15] hour to help us to understand what the
[42:18] real purpose is and we understand the
[42:20] purpose in this day this is not listen
[42:23] the purpose in our day is not for us
[42:25] just to barely get SA saved and hope
[42:27] that we make it that's not God's purpose
[42:29] in the end time because what he's trying
[42:31] to do is restore back his children his
[42:34] offspring to a position that they lost
[42:37] amen and he's working to bring us back
[42:39] into that position by his word amen they
[42:42] lost the position by the word so God
[42:44] will restore it by the word
[42:46] amen in John chap 10:
[42:52] 30 Jesus says I and my father are one
[42:58] then when the Jews took up stones again
[43:00] to Stone him Jesus answered them many
[43:02] good works have I showed you from the
[43:04] father for which of these Works do you
[43:05] Stone
[43:06] me the Jews answered him saying for a
[43:09] good work we Stone thee not but for
[43:11] blasphemy because thou thou being a man
[43:14] makest thyself
[43:16] God so they thought that was one of the
[43:20] most horrible things you could
[43:22] say because you being a man maketh
[43:25] yourself God cuz you said my father and
[43:27] I are one and so they wanted to Stone
[43:29] him saying blasphemy nobody can say
[43:31] anything like that but Jesus is about
[43:33] ready to let them know that that's not
[43:35] blasphemy that's the
[43:39] scriptures amen see in some ways it
[43:42] seems too far-fetched for
[43:45] Humanity we we're born in sin shap in
[43:48] iniquity come into the world speaking
[43:49] lies we know our Frailty we know our
[43:51] Humanity we know what hybridization has
[43:53] done to us we face it on a daily basis
[43:57] we're very well aware of our Frailty and
[43:59] our weaknesses amen but if we if we keep
[44:02] looking at Frailty and weaknesses only
[44:04] we're going to miss what God is doing in
[44:05] this day because through the Frailty and
[44:08] weaknesses and all all the uh the the
[44:10] error that we have mixed in with us
[44:12] genetically and and on our thinking amen
[44:15] through all of that God has provided
[44:17] something that'll lift his children out
[44:19] of that condition and that is his word
[44:22] amen because he did it by the spoken
[44:24] word in the original he created by the
[44:26] spoken word he he brought forth Adam by
[44:28] the spoken word he positionally placed
[44:30] him by the spoken word and everything
[44:31] ran perfect under God's spoken word made
[44:34] material until man left the word and
[44:37] then God started Redemption again but at
[44:39] the end of redemption he's bringing back
[44:41] the fullness of the word to bring a
[44:42] people back under the banner of the word
[44:44] to bring his children back to Sons and
[44:47] Daughters of
[44:49] God so it seems farfetched amen It seems
[44:52] impossible it seems like how you being a
[44:56] man make it yourself God of course we've
[44:58] got to kill you nobody can do that and
[45:00] here's Jesus's
[45:02] response verse 34 Jesus answered them is
[45:05] it not written in your law I said ye are
[45:08] Gods if I called them Gods unto whom the
[45:12] word of God came and the scripture
[45:14] cannot be broken say you of him whom the
[45:17] father has Sanctified and sent into the
[45:18] world thou Blasphemous because I said I
[45:21] am the Son of
[45:23] God he's going right to the scripture
[45:26] and says what does the scripture
[45:28] say let's go to Psalms
[45:41] 82 Psalms
[45:44] 82 and verse
[45:51] 6 he says I have said ye are gods and
[45:56] all of you are Children of the most
[45:58] high Jesus was quoting back to them the
[46:02] scriptures is that right let's go to
[46:05] Exodus chapter
[46:10] 7 this is God calling Moses and
[46:15] commissioning Moses to
[46:17] go and he says in Exodus
[46:21] 7 verse
[46:23] one
[46:25] there Exodus 7 1 and the Lord said unto
[46:28] Moses see I have made thee a God to
[46:30] pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be
[46:33] thy
[46:35] Prophet listen there was an amateur God
[46:40] in
[46:42] Egypt in the form of a prophet CU a
[46:46] prophet had the mind of God and had the
[46:47] word of God for that day and he was
[46:49] there and and and and he in Egypt they
[46:52] had a minor God and he was to be a God
[46:55] to Pharaoh amen oh my goodness what a
[46:59] what a statement friends so here comes
[47:00] Jesus claiming that he's the son of God
[47:02] and he and his father are one and now
[47:04] the Jews want to take up stones to Stone
[47:06] him and Jesus is saying why are you so
[47:08] troubled about this don't you even know
[47:09] what the Bible
[47:11] says doesn't the Bible says ye are all
[47:13] sons of God to whom the word of the Lord
[47:15] came to they are Gods amen how how how
[47:18] can you condemn me because I say I'm the
[47:20] Son of
[47:21] God Amen he was never outside the word
[47:24] amen he was just outside their carnal
[47:26] thinking
[47:28] never outside the word or the purpose of
[47:30] God but he was so foreign to the common
[47:32] conceptions of man and the ideas of man
[47:35] Hey listen we're living in the same kind
[47:37] of phase in life amen the carnal idea
[47:39] the carnal understanding amen is so far
[47:42] away amen from the from the uh the the
[47:45] things of God the things of God are so
[47:47] much higher his ways are higher than our
[47:50] ways now when when I start when I start
[47:54] preaching this way there's a there's a a
[47:57] desire in me to be
[48:01] cautious and not because I'm worried
[48:03] about this Revelation it's the
[48:05] truth but the the the pride in man will
[48:09] ruin this beautiful
[48:11] truth the arrogance and humanity and the
[48:14] pride of man will take this but if you
[48:17] want to look at our example in Jesus
[48:19] Christ when he was the last Adam or
[48:21] brother call him the second Adam he was
[48:23] the restoration of the Son of God with
[48:25] dominion over the Earth that was lost Lo
[48:27] he comes back to the Earth as the
[48:29] restoration of the
[48:31] Masterpiece and when he's on Earth amen
[48:33] he has dominion over nature amen he can
[48:36] speak to the storm he can break bread he
[48:39] can he can speak to the waves he can do
[48:41] all these things he can raise the dead
[48:43] he has Dominion is the Son of God upon
[48:45] the Earth he's the son of God and he's
[48:47] and he's reclaiming back what Adam
[48:51] lost and he's manifesting the things
[48:53] that Adam lost and and and as he's doing
[48:56] it amen he he's claiming I'm the Son of
[48:59] God he's not claiming it but they're
[49:00] perceiving he's saying I and my father
[49:02] are one he starts talking about his
[49:03] father is gone and they start to
[49:05] understand this is the Son of God and
[49:07] the divine revelation comes to Peter he
[49:08] knows that thou art Christ the son of
[49:10] the Living God and here he is amen but
[49:13] look at his life amen there's no
[49:15] arrogancy there's no Pride there's no
[49:17] there's no uh there's no
[49:21] abuse you understand what I'm
[49:23] saying one thing that'll destroy this
[49:26] beauti beautiful gospel truth is if we
[49:28] take this truth and we filter it through
[49:31] humanity and we then we start to make
[49:33] claims that we are amateur gods and
[49:35] we're God and we start doing these
[49:37] things and when you mix in Pride and
[49:40] arrogancy what you start to do is you
[49:42] start to reproduce an arrogant nature
[49:45] and how could a Son of God Amen have an
[49:47] arrogant
[49:49] nature that's not what God wants to
[49:51] manifest he wants to manifest his word
[49:54] amen not his word hybridized with our
[49:56] our nature then we're off the word again
[50:00] so we're claiming the promise that's for
[50:02] this day but we claim the promise for
[50:04] this day mixed with a hybrid nature and
[50:07] represent a hybrid word then all of a
[50:09] sudden that's not the promise for this
[50:12] day like technically the words can be
[50:15] right but the manifestation is wrong so
[50:17] now it's hybrid
[50:20] word amen and listen friends I don't I I
[50:25] I don't have the Cure The Cure is the
[50:27] word of God and the spirit of God to
[50:29] bring it to pass I believe God's growing
[50:32] us into the right manifestation we can
[50:34] look and say how am I ever going to get
[50:36] this right without hybriding it God's
[50:38] going to get it right all he needs is
[50:40] yielded vessels who will continually
[50:42] surrender and allow the abrasion of the
[50:44] word to keep working them down and
[50:46] working them down and working them down
[50:49] till they fit the image of God Amen
[50:52] there's a lot of rough places that need
[50:53] knocked off but God's got a good tool to
[50:56] knock it off and that's the word that's
[50:57] been restored through this message is
[50:59] here to shape us into Sons and Daughters
[51:01] of God to come back into our
[51:05] position that's why all the preaching
[51:07] can't feel good if it all feels good
[51:10] then we're not being molded we're not
[51:11] being shaped amen some of it needs to
[51:14] feel rough it's got to be a little bit
[51:16] abrasive to our human nature not
[51:18] abrasive to the inside nature but
[51:20] abrasive to the outside
[51:22] nature it should ring in harmony with
[51:24] the Inside Man but the outside man may
[51:28] be like oh my
[51:31] goodness amen so when we when we talk
[51:34] about this glorious truth that's being
[51:36] restored in our day amen we got to
[51:39] realize that as Jesus was the son of God
[51:42] he was the example he was the bridegroom
[51:44] tree the example tree he was the
[51:46] manifestation of the fullness of the
[51:48] word made flesh and that that man in
[51:51] that position amen he never exerted his
[51:54] own will he never worked in disobedience
[51:56] he only did that which the father showed
[51:58] him showing that a that Son of God in
[52:01] the manifestation of the restoration of
[52:04] the Son of God upon Earth was absolutely
[52:07] surrendered to the will of God and took
[52:09] no mind of his own but took the mind of
[52:11] his
[52:13] father so that he would accurately
[52:16] display the word God he was a Son of
[52:22] God oh praise God
[52:27] when brother B said in the message
[52:29] there's a man here that can turn on the
[52:31] light now in all ages God has set for so
[52:34] much of his word for each age God always
[52:37] sends somebody that the word can get
[52:39] into and show the light of it that's
[52:42] every age it does the same thing always
[52:44] does that he was the Fulfillment as I
[52:46] said of all the Divine holy powers of
[52:49] the prophets they were minor Gods when
[52:51] the word of the Lord came to a man Jesus
[52:53] said himself that he was a God you know
[52:56] that if your law said that your fathers
[52:58] back there called them uh who the word
[53:00] of God came to called them Gods how can
[53:02] you condemn me saying when I said I am
[53:04] the son of that God when the very God
[53:07] himself who spoke the word through the
[53:09] prophets he was the manifestation of
[53:11] that spoken word and if the prophet was
[53:13] called a God because he was the
[53:15] manifestation of another prophet's word
[53:17] how can you condemn him when he was the
[53:20] same thing he was the son of God as he
[53:22] shall be called The Son of God so this
[53:26] re itating again that Jesus Took back
[53:28] that position and he came as a human
[53:30] being in flesh Amen to take back that
[53:33] position that Adam fell from but he did
[53:35] so by staying with the word of
[53:38] God now staying with the word of
[53:42] God also has a nature that goes with
[53:47] it amen we're not talking technical
[53:50] terms that we can catch the technical
[53:52] terms and miss the life that still
[53:54] doesn't work yeah
[53:57] and so it's not about technical terms
[53:59] it's about coming back under the
[54:00] umbrella of the word it's coming back
[54:02] behind the word and and start to
[54:04] manifest that word that's been restored
[54:06] which will manifest a certain character
[54:09] amen that's what Jesus did they they
[54:12] that they come to Jesus and said show us
[54:14] the father and he says have I been so
[54:16] long with you that you don't know me
[54:17] when you've seen me you've seen the
[54:18] father why he was an exact replication
[54:21] on Earth and flesh of the father he was
[54:23] the he was the father in flesh he was
[54:26] God manifest In the Flesh and he says
[54:28] when you've seen me you've seen the
[54:30] father amen because he was reflecting
[54:32] back the father because he didn't take
[54:35] his own thinking he didn't take his own
[54:37] desires he surrendered it all amen and
[54:40] only did that which the father showed
[54:42] him that was the restoration back amen
[54:46] so now when we want to see now we've
[54:49] seen the unveiling in Jesus Christ of
[54:52] the Son of God but what about the
[54:54] unveiling of us as sons of of God
[54:57] because the sons of God it's been a
[54:58] mystery listen there's been a mystery
[55:00] down through time amen things were
[55:02] supposed to just come the right way if
[55:04] we say it that way things were supposed
[55:06] to came and the original uh the original
[55:08] command of God Amen Adam and Eve would
[55:11] reproduced another Son of God and
[55:13] reproduced another Son of God and
[55:14] reproduced the daughter of God until
[55:16] there was a god race upon the Earth
[55:18] though God would have replicated himself
[55:20] as a family upon the Earth it would have
[55:23] lived in harmony according to the word
[55:25] and amen but but now amen that was
[55:28] broken and after that was broken there
[55:29] was another seed sewn in and now there
[55:31] was a mingled seed upon the earth and
[55:33] the wheat and tears were sewed together
[55:35] and remember you have to wait till the
[55:37] Harvest time to sort out which is which
[55:40] so there's been a confusion all the way
[55:42] through from seed sewing time in Genesis
[55:45] to harvest time in Revelation amen
[55:47] there's been a confusion in this field
[55:49] of the earth is what is God's and what
[55:51] is not Gods what was sown by the son of
[55:54] man what was sown by the enemy amen amen
[55:58] so we understand this is the picture of
[55:59] the Bible this is the parable Jesus
[56:01] gives himself so now there's a confusion
[56:03] all the way through but he says wait
[56:05] till Harvest Time in the Harvest time
[56:07] it'll put forth its fruit and then you
[56:09] will be able to discern which is
[56:12] which how many believe this is Harvest
[56:15] Time this is Harvest Time where God once
[56:18] again is going to unveil the sons of God
[56:20] Amen which are tears and which are wheat
[56:23] amen and this isn't listen I I I I I'm
[56:26] so caution within myself as a human
[56:28] being but the Revelation is so strong
[56:30] down inside of me that God in this day
[56:32] is going to declare what is wheed and
[56:34] what is tears and he's got a method for
[56:36] declaring it and he's going to declare
[56:38] it he's going to show it it's going to
[56:39] manifest itself cuz this is the age that
[56:42] he wants to manifest in and it's not so
[56:44] you and I can pick up some terminology
[56:46] and say I'm wheat I'm an eagle I'm bride
[56:49] you can say anything you want the words
[56:51] don't mean anything what the reality is
[56:53] is the life that's down behind that
[56:55] there's got to be a real son or daughter
[56:57] of God down in the soul a seed Gene of
[57:00] God that comes to life under the
[57:02] anointing of the word of this age that
[57:04] Springs that to life and is Anointed by
[57:06] the spirit of God to manifest that life
[57:08] so it's not so we can pick up a term
[57:10] intellectually and just start repeating
[57:12] it and making ourselves feel good
[57:14] because we can say it we can say it loud
[57:15] and we can say it bold and we can say it
[57:19] often yes because if it all it took was
[57:22] having an intellectual understanding uh
[57:25] of these things and being able to
[57:27] Proclaim it the Pharisees would have had
[57:31] it they could follow their lineage back
[57:33] they knew the Old Testament they knew
[57:35] what the word said they they believed in
[57:37] some fashion the word to Moses uh they
[57:40] couldn't believe all of it we understand
[57:41] but in some carnal way they had an
[57:44] understanding of what Moses was doing
[57:45] and the separation of Abraham and and
[57:48] down through Isaac and then Jacob and
[57:50] then the 12 sons making the tribes that
[57:52] God would choose and they could find
[57:54] themselves in that part of the word amen
[57:56] and they come forth as a propagation
[57:58] naturally and they believe that they
[58:00] were the sons and daughters of God they
[58:02] believe that they were amen the the the
[58:05] chosen of
[58:07] God but when the fullness of time had
[58:09] come to bring the last Adam on the earth
[58:12] amen the manifestation of the last adom
[58:15] exposed or unveiled who the sons of God
[58:17] really were and who they
[58:19] weren't
[58:22] sir amen John chapter 8 let's turn there
[58:25] together please
[58:41] John chapter
[58:43] 8 verse
[58:48] 39 he's having a
[58:50] dialogue with some of these religious
[58:53] Jews and in John 8:39 he says they
[58:56] answered and said unto him Abraham is
[58:58] our father Jesus saith unto him if you
[59:01] were Abraham's children you would do the
[59:03] works of Abraham that's really
[59:06] important if you're Abraham's children
[59:08] now remember why is this so important
[59:10] because it's so important because the
[59:12] promise was to Abraham and to his
[59:15] seed that's who the pro God gave an
[59:17] unconditional Covenant of Grace and a
[59:19] promise to Abraham and to Abraham's seed
[59:22] so the Covenant of Grace goes with
[59:24] Abraham and his seed so it's important
[59:27] to be Seed of
[59:29] Abraham that's very very important
[59:32] because if you're a child of Abraham if
[59:34] you're the Seed of Abraham then you're
[59:36] part of the unconditional Covenant of
[59:38] Grace God amen
[59:41] amen so that's what they wanted to be so
[59:44] when they say uh uh they said unto him
[59:47] Abraham is our father what they're
[59:49] saying is is we are the children of God
[59:52] we are the elect we are part of the
[59:55] program right and Jesus says to them if
[59:59] you were Abraham's children you would do
[1:00:00] the works of Abraham he makes it really
[1:00:02] easy if you Abraham's children you would
[1:00:04] pick up his
[1:00:07] nature because that's what Offspring do
[1:00:09] they pick up the nature of their parents
[1:00:10] that's why Cain responded to Cain to God
[1:00:13] the way he did and that's why Abel could
[1:00:14] offer a sacrifice because they picked up
[1:00:16] the nature of their parents of their
[1:00:18] father and so now he's saying if Abraham
[1:00:21] were your father you would have picked
[1:00:22] up the nature of Abraham because you
[1:00:24] pick up the nature of your father
[1:00:26] oh this is
[1:00:28] good if you were Abraham's children you
[1:00:30] would do the works of Abraham but you
[1:00:32] seek to kill me a man that has told you
[1:00:35] the truth which I have heard of God this
[1:00:39] did not
[1:00:43] Abraham now look at what he says next
[1:00:45] you do the Deeds of your
[1:00:49] father he just said Abraham's not your
[1:00:51] father you got another
[1:00:54] father why because you picked up the
[1:00:57] nature of your
[1:00:58] father now he goes on he says you do the
[1:01:01] Deeds of your father then said they to
[1:01:03] him we be not born of fornication we
[1:01:06] have one father even God why did they
[1:01:08] say it this way they understood serpent
[1:01:10] seed and they said we have one father
[1:01:12] even God where are they going they're
[1:01:14] going all the way back to Adam Adam was
[1:01:15] a Son of God so Adam was a Son of God
[1:01:19] and coming down the line and Abraham
[1:01:21] Abraham was a Son of God and the
[1:01:23] promises were Abraham so now they want
[1:01:25] Abraham to be their father when he says
[1:01:27] no you have another father they say wait
[1:01:29] a minute we're not born of that
[1:01:30] fornication we have one father even
[1:01:33] God now Jesus is going to address
[1:01:36] this 42 Jesus said unto them if God were
[1:01:40] your father you would love me for I
[1:01:43] proceeded forth and came from God
[1:01:45] neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:01:48] me praise God let's read 43 and 44 why
[1:01:53] do you not understand my speech even
[1:01:55] because you cannot hear my
[1:01:57] word ye are of your father the devil and
[1:02:01] the lust of your father you will do he
[1:02:03] was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:02:05] Abode not in the truth because there is
[1:02:06] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[1:02:09] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:02:12] and the father of
[1:02:14] it my goodness when he starts to break
[1:02:17] down the attributes of the father we of
[1:02:19] Abraham say if you're Abraham you would
[1:02:21] do the works of
[1:02:22] Abraham if Cain was of Adam he would
[1:02:25] have received Revelation on the word of
[1:02:28] God but because Abel was of that lineage
[1:02:32] and Cain was of the wicked one amen Cain
[1:02:35] could not receive amen not only could he
[1:02:38] not receive a revelation of the word he
[1:02:39] couldn't even submit to the Commandment
[1:02:41] of the
[1:02:43] Lord because he says your father was a
[1:02:47] murderer from the beginning who was
[1:02:49] murdering in the beginning of time as we
[1:02:51] know in Genesis it was Cain murdered his
[1:02:53] brother Abel why did he murder Abel
[1:02:55] because Abel had the truth he did not he
[1:02:58] murdered his brother and his brother was
[1:03:00] only living out fleshing out the
[1:03:02] revelation of the word that was given
[1:03:04] for
[1:03:05] him and now they want to kill Jesus just
[1:03:08] like Cain wanted to kill Abel and what
[1:03:10] was Jesus doing he was just living out
[1:03:12] the revelation of the word amen that was
[1:03:14] all he was doing he was doing what Abel
[1:03:16] was doing they were doing what Cain was
[1:03:18] doing showing what progeny
[1:03:23] thereof praise God Amen Jesus started to
[1:03:26] peel it away he says if God were your
[1:03:29] father you would love
[1:03:31] me for I proceeded forth and came from
[1:03:35] God neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:03:38] me so now if we want to be Seed of
[1:03:43] Abraham because that's where the promise
[1:03:45] lays then we have to do the works of
[1:03:48] Abraham and if we're children of God we
[1:03:51] would believe him we would love him
[1:03:55] what does it mean to love him what what
[1:03:58] was Jesus standing there that day he was
[1:04:02] the word made
[1:04:04] flesh he was the word of God the concept
[1:04:07] the thought of God that was spoken out
[1:04:10] manifest all made into a flesh body one
[1:04:13] man Jesus Christ was the fullness of the
[1:04:16] godhead bodily he was the word of God
[1:04:18] made
[1:04:19] flesh and he says if you were a child of
[1:04:22] God you would love me
[1:04:25] because I proceeded forth and came from
[1:04:28] God listen the word Christ came from God
[1:04:34] the children of God would love him
[1:04:37] today just like they should have loved
[1:04:39] him that
[1:04:42] day praise
[1:04:44] God let's go to 2 Thessalonians
[1:04:48] now we want to start to break this
[1:04:52] down as the unveiling of the sons of
[1:05:04] gone and when I
[1:05:06] come to the unveiling of the sons of God
[1:05:10] I'm not going to start with
[1:05:15] manifestations because we believe in
[1:05:17] true
[1:05:18] manifestations but there's also brother
[1:05:20] B said anything that that any
[1:05:22] manifestation God can do the devil can
[1:05:24] copy
[1:05:27] so there needs to be something else to
[1:05:28] unveil the sons of
[1:05:31] God 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse
[1:05:39] 9 even him who's coming is after the
[1:05:42] working of Satan with all power and
[1:05:43] signs and lying wonders and with all
[1:05:45] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:05:47] them that perish because they receive
[1:05:50] not the love of the truth that they
[1:05:51] might be saved for this cause God shall
[1:05:54] send them strong delusion that they
[1:05:56] should believe a liee that they all
[1:05:59] might be damned who believe not the
[1:06:00] truth but had pleasure in
[1:06:02] unrighteousness so judgment is going to
[1:06:05] come because they had not a love for the
[1:06:08] truth Jesus told the Pharisees if God
[1:06:11] were your father you would love me he
[1:06:13] was the truth the life and the way he
[1:06:17] was the truth of God and he says if God
[1:06:19] were your father you would love me for
[1:06:20] you would love the truth because I
[1:06:22] proceeded and came forth out of God I
[1:06:23] didn't come of myself but he sent me so
[1:06:25] now they didn't love the truth when the
[1:06:27] truth was made manifest before them and
[1:06:29] he recognized you don't love me you
[1:06:32] don't love the truth amen because you're
[1:06:35] not God is not your father if God were
[1:06:36] your father you would love me if Abraham
[1:06:39] were your father you would do what
[1:06:40] Abraham did amen but you do the works of
[1:06:42] your father which is of a different
[1:06:44] lineage altogether and so now he's
[1:06:46] showing that these there there's coming
[1:06:48] a people who have not a love of the
[1:06:52] truth and because they have not a love
[1:06:54] of the truth he shall send them strong
[1:06:56] delusion that they should believe a lie
[1:06:59] that they might be damned by it amen
[1:07:02] they they why because they didn't have a
[1:07:04] love of the truth that was the
[1:07:06] differentiating point let's go back to
[1:07:10] Jude back towards the Book of
[1:07:16] Revelation Jude 1
[1:07:23] verse5 Jude 1 and5 I will therefore put
[1:07:26] you in remembrance though you know these
[1:07:29] you know this how that the Lord having
[1:07:31] saved the people out of the
[1:07:33] land of of Egypt afterward destroyed
[1:07:36] them that beli
[1:07:38] not so so follow my follow follow this
[1:07:43] train following these scriptures there
[1:07:46] was a people who had not a love of the
[1:07:47] truth so he gave them and sent them
[1:07:49] strong delusion that they'd be a lie and
[1:07:50] be damned by it because they didn't have
[1:07:52] a love of the truth we talk to the
[1:07:54] Pharisees because they didn't love him
[1:07:56] and he was the truth he knew where their
[1:07:58] father was now there's a people that he
[1:08:01] saved out of Egypt and those people that
[1:08:03] he saved out of Egypt were his chosen
[1:08:04] people he chose them he selected them he
[1:08:06] rescued them he redeemed them he brought
[1:08:08] them out of Egypt amen but along the way
[1:08:11] amen they condemned themselves and they
[1:08:13] perished who perished who was destroyed
[1:08:16] those that believe not so the ones that
[1:08:20] believed not were separated from the
[1:08:22] program of God who of that original that
[1:08:24] came out got to go into the promise of
[1:08:26] God it was two who believe the full word
[1:08:29] of God am amen it was Joshua and Caleb
[1:08:33] who could take God out his word and say
[1:08:35] hey when when they cross over and they
[1:08:36] begin to spy out the land and they saw
[1:08:38] amen the great feats that the people in
[1:08:40] the land had done and the mighty armies
[1:08:42] and the walled cities and the Giants
[1:08:44] amen they looked at it carnally and
[1:08:45] naturally amen they got afraid they were
[1:08:48] scared that they could not overcome and
[1:08:50] they came and they brought back an evil
[1:08:52] report amen the evil report was against
[1:08:55] the word word because God says I will
[1:08:58] bring you into a land I will I will
[1:09:00] drive out the inhabitants I will I will
[1:09:02] I will I will God told them the promise
[1:09:04] and what he was going to do for them
[1:09:06] when they got to the promised land and
[1:09:08] they sent the spies across they saw how
[1:09:11] difficult and how insurmountable and how
[1:09:13] incapable they were and they come back
[1:09:15] and say we be not able but there was two
[1:09:17] people who could stay with the word of
[1:09:18] God and those two were Joshua and Caleb
[1:09:21] and say hey we be we're more than able
[1:09:23] to take them they're but bread for us if
[1:09:25] God before us what were they believing
[1:09:27] they were believing the word of God that
[1:09:29] came through that prophet in their day
[1:09:30] they had accepted the word proving that
[1:09:33] they were children of
[1:09:36] God but who was destroyed those that
[1:09:40] believe
[1:09:41] not amen listen they believed a
[1:09:44] lot think about the ones who were
[1:09:46] destroyed they believed that God parted
[1:09:49] the Red Sea they believe that Mana Came
[1:09:52] From Heaven they believe that the
[1:09:54] smitten rock produced water water yes
[1:09:56] they believed all of that but when it
[1:09:58] got time to cross over and they come to
[1:10:01] the difficult the the difficult task
[1:10:03] that lay ahead of them they disbelieved
[1:10:05] that part of the word and when they
[1:10:06] disbelieved they were cut out of the
[1:10:07] economy of God
[1:10:09] amen amen amen the Pharisees believed a
[1:10:14] whole lot that was written in the
[1:10:16] Bible but when it came time for the
[1:10:18] Fulfillment of the promise they didn't
[1:10:20] believe the Fulfillment of the promise
[1:10:21] that was before their eyes
[1:10:26] now remember we're talking about the
[1:10:27] unveiling of the sons of God the
[1:10:29] unveiling of the amateur Gods Hebrews
[1:10:32] chapter 3 let's turn there together
[1:10:44] please Hebrews chapter
[1:10:47] 3 let's look at verse
[1:10:52] 14 for it for while it is said
[1:10:56] today if you will hear his voice Harden
[1:10:59] not your heart as in the the provocation
[1:11:01] the the the provocation is a story we
[1:11:03] just talked about when they provoked God
[1:11:06] by not believing the word and not
[1:11:07] wanting to cross over and take the
[1:11:09] lamb Harden not your heart is in the
[1:11:11] provocation for some when they heard did
[1:11:14] provoke how be it not all that came out
[1:11:16] of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he
[1:11:18] grieved 40 years was it not with them
[1:11:20] that had sinned whose carcasses fell in
[1:11:22] the wilderness and to whom swear he that
[1:11:24] they should not enter into his rest but
[1:11:26] to them that believe not so we see that
[1:11:29] they could not enter in because of
[1:11:32] unbelief remember how brother brandham
[1:11:35] tells us that the only real Sin there is
[1:11:37] is unbelief said unbelief in what
[1:11:39] unbelief in the word of God what did
[1:11:41] they have what did these spies have in
[1:11:43] the rest of the nation when they rose up
[1:11:45] in a bitter cry amen at the at the at
[1:11:47] the testimony of the the 10 false
[1:11:50] Witnesses amen they they cried out and
[1:11:52] wanted to go back to Egypt and all that
[1:11:54] amen they they they were cut out he was
[1:11:56] displeased with them because they
[1:11:57] provoked him in the wilderness by what
[1:11:59] by not believing his promised word when
[1:12:02] they come face to face with it they did
[1:12:04] not believe it amen and so now they were
[1:12:07] kept out of the promise who was kept out
[1:12:09] of the promise those that didn't
[1:12:11] believe now now listen close this is
[1:12:15] what I want to drive down to it wasn't
[1:12:19] the ones who were vile and wicked and
[1:12:21] nasty and had a temper and and didn't
[1:12:23] always do what Moses said he cut them
[1:12:24] out because they were hard to deal with
[1:12:26] that wasn't how he differentiated who
[1:12:28] went in and who didn't go in and he
[1:12:31] didn't he didn't take Joshua and Caleb
[1:12:32] because they were always nice to their
[1:12:34] neighbor and they said sweet things and
[1:12:35] they took care of their mom really well
[1:12:37] he that's that was never the
[1:12:38] differentiating point that was not the
[1:12:40] deciding factor but it came down to the
[1:12:43] basis of faith and
[1:12:44] unbelief the separation line was faith
[1:12:47] and unbelief amen the the the the
[1:12:49] whether you went in or not who didn't go
[1:12:51] in those that didn't believe what didn't
[1:12:53] they believe they didn't believe this
[1:12:55] portion of the word there was others
[1:12:56] they could claim to believe there was
[1:12:58] others they acted and participated in
[1:13:00] but they didn't accept this truth that
[1:13:02] God was going to give that land to them
[1:13:04] when they saw all the unsurmountable
[1:13:06] odds and they provoked God unto wrath
[1:13:09] amen and he rejected them and he said
[1:13:11] they're not going to go in they will not
[1:13:13] go in and they everyone died in the
[1:13:15] wilderness but there was two who went in
[1:13:17] not because they were nicest and better
[1:13:19] looking and more intelligent that wasn't
[1:13:21] the basis the basis for them entering in
[1:13:23] when the others were rejected is because
[1:13:25] said if God before us were're more than
[1:13:27] able they're but bread for us cuz we
[1:13:29] believe what Moses said all the way back
[1:13:31] in Egypt come from God and it's nothing
[1:13:33] but the
[1:13:35] truth those are the two that went in
[1:13:37] it's not Good Conduct amen it's not bad
[1:13:41] conduct it's faith and in belief in the
[1:13:43] promised word of
[1:13:46] God and when I say that I feel like I
[1:13:49] have to qualify my statements because
[1:13:50] the more people hear you say something
[1:13:52] the more questions you have listen it
[1:13:53] doesn't mean that you don't going to
[1:13:55] have righteous acts and righteous Deeds
[1:13:57] amen that's the outcropping of Faith
[1:13:59] amen if you have faith genuine faith in
[1:14:01] the word of God you will obey the word
[1:14:03] of God and when you get off the word of
[1:14:05] God you'll repent and come back in line
[1:14:07] with the word of
[1:14:08] God you understand we're not saying act
[1:14:11] any way you want you're going to go in
[1:14:12] any ways that's fine no that's a very
[1:14:14] clear indication that you don't believe
[1:14:16] the word of God if you trample over it
[1:14:17] so lightly and esteem it so
[1:14:22] little but conduct is not the base
[1:14:26] faith is the
[1:14:30] basis this is how God unveils his
[1:14:35] seedline this is how God has always
[1:14:37] unveiled his seed line from the
[1:14:40] beginning to the end he has always used
[1:14:44] the measuring stick of faith in the
[1:14:47] present manifestation of the
[1:14:50] word that has been from the days of Noah
[1:14:53] Abraham Noah Moses all the way down
[1:14:56] through the basis has always been faith
[1:14:59] in present truth
[1:15:03] am in Noah's
[1:15:06] day you could believe the story of
[1:15:08] creation
[1:15:12] 100% you could believe the fall of Man
[1:15:15] you can believe Adam's sin you can
[1:15:16] believe the creation of the woman you
[1:15:18] can believe all of that that was
[1:15:23] fine but to dis believe Noah's message
[1:15:26] was
[1:15:27] death cuz you weren't on the boat
[1:15:30] because that boat was the manifested
[1:15:32] word of God and it was life and it was
[1:15:34] the only place of life
[1:15:37] amen man and you can say oh that that's
[1:15:40] harsh that's not harsh that's
[1:15:43] Grace God s God looked down and saw that
[1:15:46] all the Deeds of men were evil and his
[1:15:48] heart was continually and evil and God
[1:15:50] was grieved that he had made man and he
[1:15:52] was going to wipe them off the Earth
[1:15:53] amen but he decided to have favor upon
[1:15:57] one man and through that one man he
[1:15:58] would open a door of mercy and grace
[1:16:00] through that one man that was the grace
[1:16:02] of God that wasn't anything harsh that
[1:16:04] wasn't anything hateful that wasn't
[1:16:05] anything mean amen the message of the
[1:16:08] hour in Noah's day was the greatest
[1:16:10] Grace the world had ever seen cuz every
[1:16:12] one of them deserved death amen but God
[1:16:14] had provided a way of
[1:16:16] life amen amen and we look at that
[1:16:20] through Modern Leo Dean mentality and
[1:16:22] you think well how that's not fair
[1:16:24] that's not not fair you should have done
[1:16:26] this and you should have done that why
[1:16:27] do they have to listen to Noah Noah was
[1:16:29] a you know Noah may have been a little
[1:16:31] bit grumpy and on edge once in a
[1:16:38] while and he may not have been
[1:16:39] particularly handsome and he may not
[1:16:41] have had the smoothest speaking voice
[1:16:43] and you know they kind of got tired of
[1:16:44] Noah's message because he preached the
[1:16:46] same thing over and over for 120
[1:16:49] years yesall so he may not have been the
[1:16:53] most charismatic he may not have the
[1:16:54] most charismatic message and they may
[1:16:56] not have had the biggest church and and
[1:16:58] you know how is that fair what if
[1:17:00] there's other sincere people there was
[1:17:02] other people who loved God there was
[1:17:03] other people who wanted this and that
[1:17:05] but but listen God had looked down and
[1:17:08] man was Fallen man had corrupted himself
[1:17:11] and man's desire was continually on evil
[1:17:14] amen man was deserving of death they had
[1:17:16] left the word of God forsaken the word
[1:17:18] of God taken their own lustful desires
[1:17:20] went their own way and God was just and
[1:17:22] righteous in every way to wipe them out
[1:17:25] amen but God sent a prophet with a
[1:17:29] message and that message was a message
[1:17:31] of life and mercy Redemption
[1:17:36] forgiveness amen listen if you got on
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:40] boat it didn't matter how vile you were
[1:17:43] the day before if you got on that boat
[1:17:45] you
[1:17:48] lived if you refused to get on that boat
[1:17:50] didn't matter how nice you were how many
[1:17:52] Good Deeds you did and how many people's
[1:17:53] lives you saved and how much money you
[1:17:55] had given to the poor if you didn't get
[1:17:57] on that boat you were
[1:18:02] lost listen this isn't something new
[1:18:05] this is the way the word has always
[1:18:07] been when God's own son Adam violated
[1:18:12] the word of God God sent him out of the
[1:18:14] G Garden according to his promised
[1:18:17] word man this is the way it's always
[1:18:20] been these are not new Concepts this is
[1:18:23] the reality yes this is the method by
[1:18:26] which God has already always divided the
[1:18:30] wheat and the tears this is where he's
[1:18:32] always divided the righteous from the
[1:18:35] unrighteous he didn't use deeds he used
[1:18:40] faith I mean let let's just think about
[1:18:43] this for a
[1:18:44] minute David king of Israel called by
[1:18:48] God Anointed with by a prophet
[1:18:50] positioned amen by the will of God he
[1:18:53] did one of the most V things that a
[1:18:55] human being can
[1:18:57] do he took another man's wife and then
[1:18:59] tried to cover it and hide it by having
[1:19:01] the man killed and I mean it was it was
[1:19:03] shameful and he used other people to do
[1:19:05] his dirty work it was a shameful vile
[1:19:08] degradating piece of of human human work
[1:19:11] of
[1:19:14] humanity and it was horrible and there
[1:19:16] was a judgment that came the spanking
[1:19:18] came God corrected it God sent a prophet
[1:19:20] to correct
[1:19:21] it but that act did not change who David
[1:19:30] was David was still a man after goat's
[1:19:32] own
[1:19:33] heart did horrible horrible things but
[1:19:36] when God when God sent a prophet to come
[1:19:38] his way amen he recognize that prophet
[1:19:41] in the word of God and he says it's me
[1:19:43] I'm the man and I'm
[1:19:45] guilty and immediately God says and God
[1:19:48] has put away your sin immediately
[1:19:51] through that Prophet immediately says
[1:19:52] and God has put away your sin
[1:19:56] Grace amen listen it's it's faith in the
[1:20:01] word of
[1:20:07] God let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 it's
[1:20:11] got a few more places that I want to
[1:20:13] read this and show
[1:20:15] this Hebrews chapter
[1:20:23] 11 in Hebrews
[1:20:27] 11:30 says by faith the walls of Jericho
[1:20:31] fell down after they were compassed
[1:20:32] about 7even Days by faith the Harlot
[1:20:36] Rahab perished not with them that
[1:20:37] believed not when she had received the
[1:20:40] spies with
[1:20:41] peace does anybody know what rahab's
[1:20:44] occupation
[1:20:48] was Rahab was a
[1:20:51] harlot but when the spies came to her
[1:20:54] place she was willing to hide them
[1:20:55] because she believed all that she had
[1:20:57] heard said we have heard about your God
[1:21:00] we have heard what they did at the Red
[1:21:02] Sea we have heard and she
[1:21:06] believed and it says listen she received
[1:21:09] the spies she hid the spies she believed
[1:21:11] the message of the spies she believed
[1:21:13] the word for her day she believed what
[1:21:14] moses' message was she believed the
[1:21:16] crossing of the Red Sea she believed God
[1:21:18] was with these people and that she was
[1:21:19] taking them to the promise she believed
[1:21:21] the word for her day amen and she was a
[1:21:23] prostitute Harlot amen vile amen you
[1:21:27] couldn't match her life to another life
[1:21:29] and say she's
[1:21:32] righteous amen but it said but by faith
[1:21:36] by what belief by faith believing by
[1:21:40] faith the Harlot
[1:21:44] I I'm so glad that we're in Hebrews chap
[1:21:47] 11 The Heroes of Faith and the title she
[1:21:50] has is the Harlot Rahab
[1:21:55] I think God wants us to catch something
[1:21:58] here and her title is the Harlot Rahab
[1:22:01] the Harlot Rahab perish
[1:22:05] not perish not with them that believed
[1:22:07] not when she had received the spies with
[1:22:09] peace what saved her faith by faith
[1:22:13] Rahab perish not with them that believe
[1:22:16] not what did God use to differentiate
[1:22:18] between everybody else in Jericho and
[1:22:20] Rahab in her house it was her faith amen
[1:22:23] everybody else believed not and
[1:22:25] everybody who believed not
[1:22:28] perished why because this message that
[1:22:31] Moses was packing was the word for that
[1:22:33] day and when this Gentile Harlot outside
[1:22:36] the economy of God with an unrighteous
[1:22:38] life when she believed it confessed it
[1:22:41] and acted upon it God saved her from the
[1:22:43] destruction that was
[1:22:49] coming amen
[1:22:55] let's go to Hebrews
[1:23:00] 11:6 he
[1:23:02] says Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it
[1:23:05] is impossible to please him for he that
[1:23:08] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:23:10] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:23:12] diligently seek him there's no that's
[1:23:15] why Works won't work good deeds won't
[1:23:18] work niceties won't work and all of
[1:23:20] those things are good like we should
[1:23:21] have all those when I say things like
[1:23:23] that I'm not belittling any of that I
[1:23:24] want you to be nice especially when
[1:23:26] you're talking to me be super nice and I
[1:23:28] want to be super nice to you we want to
[1:23:30] be nice to our neighbors we want to be
[1:23:31] good people we want to be a good
[1:23:33] representation of the word but the
[1:23:34] reality is we've still got this sticky
[1:23:36] cber nature and we can't perform at that
[1:23:38] level all the time we have all these
[1:23:40] trippings and trappings and fallings
[1:23:42] amen we got to realize that that's not
[1:23:44] what God's looking at anyways God's
[1:23:46] looking at Faith in his present truth
[1:23:48] that's the dividing line but God is so
[1:23:50] gracious to keep reminding of his word
[1:23:52] and sending his Spirit to correct us
[1:23:54] when we're wrong because he wants to
[1:23:55] bring us to Manifest this
[1:24:00] word amen so by faith the Harlot
[1:24:03] Rahab perished not with them that
[1:24:07] believe not without faith it is
[1:24:09] impossible to please God so all of our
[1:24:14] church attendant and dressing nice and
[1:24:16] acting nice and all of that without
[1:24:18] faith it can't please
[1:24:21] God Amen
[1:24:25] praise
[1:24:28] God oh praise God let's go to First John
[1:24:41] three 1
[1:24:44] John chapter
[1:24:47] 3 in verse
[1:24:51] 4 whosoever commit a sin transgresses
[1:24:53] also the law for sin is the
[1:24:55] transgression of the law and you know
[1:24:58] that he was manifested to take away our
[1:24:59] sins and to him is no sin whosoever
[1:25:02] abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth
[1:25:05] hath not seen him neither knoweth him
[1:25:08] little children let no man deceive you
[1:25:09] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:25:12] even as he is righteous he that
[1:25:14] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:25:16] devil sinth from the beginning for this
[1:25:18] purpose the Son of God was manifest that
[1:25:21] he might destroy the works of the devil
[1:25:23] whosoever is born of of God does not
[1:25:25] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:25:27] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:25:30] God in this the children of God are
[1:25:33] manifest in the children of the devil
[1:25:35] whosoever do doth not righteousness is
[1:25:38] not of God neither he that loveth not
[1:25:40] his brother so when it says he that
[1:25:42] sinth not is not of God Amen and he that
[1:25:44] is of God cannot sin amen if you take
[1:25:47] brother bram's definition of sin then
[1:25:49] the scripture makes
[1:25:51] sense if you take this definition of sin
[1:25:54] is unbelief the real only everything
[1:25:56] else is attributes of sin but the real
[1:25:59] Sin is
[1:26:00] unbelief and then you go back and look
[1:26:02] at this in verse 7 little children no
[1:26:04] man deceive you he that does doeth
[1:26:07] righteousness is righteous so I'm going
[1:26:09] to look at what righteousness is here in
[1:26:11] a minute even as he is righteous he that
[1:26:14] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:26:16] devil sinth from the beginning for this
[1:26:18] purpose the Son of God was manifest that
[1:26:20] he might destroy the works of the devil
[1:26:22] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:26:25] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:26:28] cannot sin because he is born of
[1:26:31] God why because the faith of God has
[1:26:34] been injected into his life amen you're
[1:26:37] saved by grace through faith and that
[1:26:38] not of yourselves it is a gift of God
[1:26:40] and the seed of God is there to believe
[1:26:41] the
[1:26:43] word
[1:26:44] amen in this the children of God are
[1:26:47] manifest and the children of the devil
[1:26:49] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[1:26:51] of God neither he that loveth not his
[1:26:54] brother so now I want to look at what is
[1:26:57] this doing
[1:26:58] righteousness praise God let's go to
[1:27:00] Romans chapter
[1:27:05] 4 remember they told they told Jesus he
[1:27:09] was they were uh children of Abraham
[1:27:12] Abraham was their
[1:27:14] father but Jesus said if you were you
[1:27:17] would do the works of
[1:27:20] Abraham and let's look at uh Romans 4:1
[1:27:24] one
[1:27:27] together what shall we say then that
[1:27:29] Abraham our father has pertained to the
[1:27:31] flesh has found for If Abraham were
[1:27:33] justified by works he had whereof to
[1:27:35] Glory but not before God for what saith
[1:27:39] the scripture Abraham believed God and
[1:27:42] it was counted unto him for
[1:27:46] righteousness I love that
[1:27:50] scripture it didn't attain it by the
[1:27:52] working of the law because if we attain
[1:27:54] it by the working of the law then God
[1:27:56] has administered to us salvation by debt
[1:28:00] not by Grace but God wanted to give it
[1:28:02] by Grace Amen to be sure that it would
[1:28:05] come to the seed that the elect would
[1:28:06] get it amen so it's by Grace how can it
[1:28:09] be by Grace amen the only way it can be
[1:28:11] by Grace is if it comes by faith because
[1:28:13] it can't be by doing the works of the
[1:28:15] law the righteousness of doing the works
[1:28:17] because if you do the works and God owes
[1:28:18] you salvation then God is in debt to you
[1:28:20] and God cannot be in debt to you and
[1:28:22] then you're not saved by grace you're
[1:28:24] saved by works because God owes it to
[1:28:26] you because of what you
[1:28:29] did and God never saved anybody because
[1:28:31] he owed it to them what he owes us is
[1:28:33] death destruction termination off of
[1:28:35] this Earth that's what we
[1:28:38] deserve but it's his
[1:28:40] grace that allows us to partake of
[1:28:44] life so I want to read this again what
[1:28:47] shall we say then that Abraham our
[1:28:49] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[1:28:51] found this is good because we need to be
[1:28:54] if we want to be part of the Covenant of
[1:28:56] Grace we have to be Seed of Abraham it
[1:28:59] only works if we're Seed of Abraham so
[1:29:01] if you're Seed of Abraham you're part of
[1:29:03] the Covenant of unmerited Grace amen and
[1:29:05] God has promised that you inherited all
[1:29:08] things amen and that he'll be a God to
[1:29:11] you and he'll be a father and a God to
[1:29:13] you and you'll be his people all that is
[1:29:15] under the promise of
[1:29:17] Abraham so what what is Abraham our
[1:29:20] fathers pertain to the flesh hath found
[1:29:21] for If Abraham were justified by work
[1:29:24] Heth whereof to Glory but not before
[1:29:27] God for what sayith the scripture
[1:29:30] Abraham believed God faith and it was
[1:29:34] counted unto him for righteousness so
[1:29:37] Abraham is righteous why is Abraham
[1:29:40] righteous not because of all of his
[1:29:43] deeds but because he believed the word
[1:29:46] for his day when God spoke to him he
[1:29:49] believed it when he believed it it was
[1:29:51] counted or imputed unto him or put on
[1:29:53] him that he was righteous he got the
[1:29:56] title of righteous not by the Deeds of
[1:29:59] righteousness but by faith in the
[1:30:01] promise word of God
[1:30:05] Amen and we have to be children of
[1:30:10] Abraham and he said if you were
[1:30:12] Abraham's children you would do the
[1:30:13] Deeds of Abraham what were the Deeds of
[1:30:15] Abraham believe on whom God has
[1:30:18] sent he believed the word of God when he
[1:30:21] believed what God had told him it was
[1:30:23] counted to him for right
[1:30:24] that was the Deeds of Abraham that's
[1:30:26] what made him righteous listen it wasn't
[1:30:28] selling out his wife
[1:30:31] twice it wasn't lying to Pharaoh it
[1:30:34] wasn't lying to aimc it wasn't refusing
[1:30:37] to protect and defend his wife but sell
[1:30:39] her out to another king to protect his
[1:30:41] own that was not the Deeds of
[1:30:42] righteousness that gave him life and
[1:30:44] part of the promise but but he believed
[1:30:47] God and it was accounted unto him for
[1:30:51] righteousness amen
[1:30:54] let's look at uh verse 13
[1:30:57] now for the promise that he should be
[1:31:00] heir of the world was not to Abraham or
[1:31:02] his seed through the law but through the
[1:31:04] righteousness of faith for if they which
[1:31:07] are of the law be heirs faith is void
[1:31:10] and the promise made of none effect what
[1:31:13] is he saying you can't get this by
[1:31:15] obeying the law and doing the Deeds of
[1:31:17] the law you can't inherit it that way
[1:31:20] you inherit it by faith and when you are
[1:31:22] you have the faith of faithful Abraham
[1:31:25] then it then then it notifies you and
[1:31:28] God that you're a child of
[1:31:31] Abraham amen why because you have the
[1:31:33] faith of
[1:31:34] Abraham praise God now let's go to
[1:31:38] Hebrews chapter
[1:31:40] 11 I'm reading through lots of
[1:31:42] scriptures but I love it there's a lot
[1:31:45] more but we just can't do them all right
[1:31:47] now but we might get to them all back to
[1:31:49] Hebrews chapter 11 I should have just
[1:31:51] had you bookmark it
[1:31:54] amen so now we we see that the dividing
[1:31:58] line the separating between righteous
[1:32:00] and unrighteous listen isn't just deeds
[1:32:03] and now don't get me wrong there are
[1:32:05] righteous and unrighteous
[1:32:07] Deeds without a doubt you can do
[1:32:09] unrighteousness and you can do
[1:32:11] righteousness We should strive to do
[1:32:13] righteousness We should strive to avoid
[1:32:14] unrighteousness but when it comes down
[1:32:16] to it the dividing line of what's
[1:32:18] righteous and not righteous is whether
[1:32:19] or not you believe God because
[1:32:21] righteousness is by imputation
[1:32:24] because he believed God and we're
[1:32:26] children of Abraham now let's go to
[1:32:28] Hebrews
[1:32:33] 11:32 it
[1:32:35] says it says and what shall I more say
[1:32:38] for the time shall failed to tell of
[1:32:40] Gideon and of Barack of Samson of jeffa
[1:32:44] of David also of Samuel and of the
[1:32:46] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:32:49] kingdoms through righteousness obtained
[1:32:50] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[1:32:52] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:32:54] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:32:56] were made strong wax Valiant in fight
[1:32:59] turned to flight the armies of the
[1:33:01] aliens whom women received their dead
[1:33:04] raised to life again and the others were
[1:33:05] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[1:33:08] they might obtain a better resurrection
[1:33:10] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[1:33:12] and scorings and moreover of bonds and
[1:33:14] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:33:16] saw aunder were tempted were slain with
[1:33:19] the sword they wandered about in sheep
[1:33:20] skins and goat skins being destitute
[1:33:22] Afflicted tormented
[1:33:24] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:33:26] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:33:28] in dens and caves of the earth and these
[1:33:30] all having obtained a good report
[1:33:32] through faith receive not the promise
[1:33:35] God having provided some better thing
[1:33:37] for us that they without us should not
[1:33:40] be made
[1:33:41] perfect amen so now we see these Victors
[1:33:45] of faith and and Hebrews 11 goes through
[1:33:47] a whole series of the victors of Faith
[1:33:50] they overcame by faith that's what it
[1:33:51] said at the very beginning and and and
[1:33:54] what shall I more say of all of these
[1:33:56] men who through faith subdued kingdoms
[1:33:59] it was all done by faith it wasn't done
[1:34:01] by their Merit or by their strong will
[1:34:03] or by their strong arm or by their
[1:34:05] strong mind it was all accomplished by
[1:34:07] faith amen they believed what God told
[1:34:10] them in their day and when they believed
[1:34:12] that and surrendered to it God worked
[1:34:14] through them to perform some miraculous
[1:34:16] things but it was all by faith it was
[1:34:19] all by the word of God Amen brother
[1:34:22] bandam says in the stature of a perfect
[1:34:24] man says you get it these people who
[1:34:26] died in here are depending and waiting
[1:34:28] on
[1:34:29] us so this church has got to come to
[1:34:32] perfection in order to bring the
[1:34:34] resurrection and they're un their their
[1:34:37] souls under the altar waiting for this
[1:34:39] church to come to its Perfection that
[1:34:41] when Christ does come so now he's saying
[1:34:44] they without us are not yet made perfect
[1:34:46] and brother B says this church has to
[1:34:48] come to Perfection amen how how is she
[1:34:51] going to come Perfection I believe God
[1:34:53] has said a perfect word to bring a
[1:34:55] Perfect Bride to a perfect manifestation
[1:34:57] amen but she's going to have to do it
[1:34:59] through a perfect surrender am amen I
[1:35:03] believe it's the age that we live in all
[1:35:06] down through time God was unveiling the
[1:35:09] righteous seed if we read down through
[1:35:11] the Bible if you if brother BM says the
[1:35:15] Lamb's Book of Life is the Bible the
[1:35:17] book of redemption the marriage
[1:35:19] certificate he's got all kinds of names
[1:35:21] for them and he uses them synonymously
[1:35:22] with one another
[1:35:24] but if we open our Bible and start
[1:35:26] flipping through and reading through
[1:35:27] we're going to read a record of
[1:35:30] humanity of
[1:35:33] people of people in various
[1:35:35] circumstances and trials and
[1:35:37] difficulties and all kinds of
[1:35:39] circumstances but in the stories it's
[1:35:42] always somehow God has a way to bring
[1:35:44] him his word through a prophet and they
[1:35:46] brings the word through a prophet and
[1:35:48] certain of them are able to accept that
[1:35:50] word or to act upon it and when they act
[1:35:52] upon or accept or receive receive the
[1:35:54] word then the miraculous things happen
[1:35:56] afterwards and there's great victories
[1:35:57] that take place and great things that
[1:35:59] are manifest and and then it goes to the
[1:36:01] next story and you go to the next story
[1:36:03] of great trouble and tribulation and
[1:36:05] failings and fallings and risings and
[1:36:07] it's all through the Bible but if you if
[1:36:09] you follow it it's a record of
[1:36:12] humanity yes and God is constantly
[1:36:15] injecting himself into the story and
[1:36:17] how's he injecting himself into the
[1:36:19] story by bringing a word a prophecy some
[1:36:23] un failing of a word amen through a
[1:36:25] prophet through a messenger some way and
[1:36:27] when he injects that word there's a
[1:36:28] certain people on the Earth at that time
[1:36:30] that connect with that word and believe
[1:36:32] that word and through those individuals
[1:36:34] he does Supernatural miraculous things
[1:36:37] and then and then the story closes out
[1:36:39] and and time moves on and he opens
[1:36:41] another chapter and he does the same
[1:36:42] thing a different way but the same thing
[1:36:45] and that chapter closes and moves on and
[1:36:47] he opens another chapter and he does the
[1:36:48] same thing just a different way the
[1:36:51] names change the circumstances the
[1:36:53] locations but he keeps doing the same
[1:36:55] thing over and over and over again his
[1:36:57] people get in a circumstance that's
[1:36:59] difficult the situation is dire he comes
[1:37:01] on the scene he brings the word amen the
[1:37:03] word brings uh people to light they
[1:37:06] align with that word God does something
[1:37:08] Supernatural amen it's a miracle amen
[1:37:10] and then then we move
[1:37:15] on what is it it's the unveiling of the
[1:37:19] sons of
[1:37:20] God
[1:37:22] right praise
[1:37:24] God not by might and not by power but by
[1:37:29] my spirit sayth the
[1:37:33] Lord all found through this record in
[1:37:36] the history of humanity there's always
[1:37:40] been bold claims many people claiming to
[1:37:43] be the righteous people the only ones
[1:37:46] the the the seed of God that there
[1:37:48] there's always been
[1:37:50] claims and I would venture to say
[1:37:52] there's always been confusion
[1:37:56] on who's right and who has it and who
[1:37:58] doesn't have it and what word is true
[1:38:00] and what word is not true
[1:38:03] and I mean they the Jews came out of
[1:38:08] Babylon and they came back with rabinal
[1:38:11] writings that weren't the Old
[1:38:13] Testament and they had they had taken a
[1:38:15] bunch of ideas and some of them they
[1:38:17] picked up from the Persians some of the
[1:38:18] Babylonians and they mix them in with
[1:38:20] Judaism and and they start presenting it
[1:38:22] and it creates great division and when
[1:38:23] the time that Jesus showed up on the
[1:38:25] scene they were all fractured and and
[1:38:27] divided on who's right and who's got the
[1:38:29] real truth and who's following what
[1:38:30] Rabbi from what century
[1:38:34] and it's always been that way which
[1:38:36] denomination right which truth is Right
[1:38:38] which this is right which that is right
[1:38:40] but God has always had a
[1:38:42] way he's always had a way to call his
[1:38:45] elect seed to to unveil his children and
[1:38:48] that way has always been by a fresh
[1:38:50] revelation of the word
[1:38:53] and God would bring a fresh revelation
[1:38:55] of his word and that fresh revelation of
[1:38:58] the word what what was it doing this is
[1:39:00] just my perspective now looking back it
[1:39:02] was unveiling the children of God
[1:39:06] because they were able to take God at
[1:39:08] his word they were some of them
[1:39:11] fishermen and tax collectors and harlots
[1:39:14] and farmers and outcasts and of the
[1:39:17] smallest tribe and the youngest sons and
[1:39:19] the
[1:39:23] if it could be true for them why can't
[1:39:25] it be true for
[1:39:26] you if he would go to the least of the
[1:39:29] tribes if he could go to the least House
[1:39:31] of the tribe if he could go to the
[1:39:33] youngest son if he could pull out a
[1:39:34] Gideon that way why can't it be
[1:39:38] you and listen Gideon was what was
[1:39:40] Gideon doing he was back behind the the
[1:39:43] threshing floor back behind the wine
[1:39:45] press threshing out a little wheat so
[1:39:47] that the Philistines wouldn't come and
[1:39:48] steal it from him again I mean this
[1:39:50] wasn't a mighty man this wasn't a great
[1:39:52] Victor this wasn't somebody who was you
[1:39:55] know
[1:39:57] overcoming he was back behind the wine
[1:40:00] press I can M every once in a while he'd
[1:40:02] poke poke his head up and make sure
[1:40:04] nobody was
[1:40:06] coming but the angel came to him because
[1:40:08] he knew who he was and he said now
[1:40:10] Gideon th Mighty Man of
[1:40:12] Valor can you imagine how that would
[1:40:14] feel if you were hiding in the closet
[1:40:16] counting your money cuz you didn't want
[1:40:17] anybody to steal it and you're nervous
[1:40:19] and your heart's beating because every
[1:40:20] time you hear a knock on the door this
[1:40:21] could be the thief's coming and every
[1:40:23] time they come I have no power to resist
[1:40:24] them and all I can do is just give them
[1:40:26] all my money yeah right and you're back
[1:40:29] there with the lights off and you're
[1:40:30] counting your money and you're praying
[1:40:31] that nobody comes to the door and all of
[1:40:33] a sudden an angel's behind you and says
[1:40:35] oh
[1:40:37] Chad you mighty man of Valor you Warrior
[1:40:41] you strong bold
[1:40:49] Overcomer it wasn't his deeds it wasn't
[1:40:52] his Merit it was in his
[1:40:54] actions he was a seed of
[1:41:00] God you ever notice in the Bible how
[1:41:03] there was
[1:41:04] times there's certain people in the
[1:41:06] Bible that God wouldn't put up
[1:41:08] with he gave them a chance they didn't
[1:41:10] take the chance they missed
[1:41:12] it you know there's other people in the
[1:41:14] Bible seems like God will just keep
[1:41:15] putting up
[1:41:19] with the angel comes and tells Gideon a
[1:41:22] message and Gideon says okay well uh
[1:41:24] don't be mad at me but I need a sign
[1:41:27] like an Angelic visitor is not enough
[1:41:29] for me I need a sign and one who knew my
[1:41:32] name so I'm going to throw out this
[1:41:35] Fleet and the you know the de on the one
[1:41:38] side do on the ground you know the whole
[1:41:39] story amen and it happens exactly like
[1:41:41] he asked he says once again oh please
[1:41:43] don't be angry with me but but I need
[1:41:45] another sign and why why is God bearing
[1:41:48] with this this Gideon what what's the
[1:41:50] whole story because God knows what's
[1:41:52] inside ins Gideon Gideon doesn't yet
[1:41:54] know what's inside Gideon but God knows
[1:41:56] what's inside Gideon and God is going to
[1:41:58] bring his word with the manifestation of
[1:42:00] the word to wake up something that's
[1:42:02] inside of Gideon and Gideon is going to
[1:42:04] come to the place where he can surrender
[1:42:06] to that word of God and God will use
[1:42:08] Gideon by faith to rot victory over the
[1:42:14] armies he wasn't coming because he was
[1:42:16] the best the strongest that you know you
[1:42:18] know the whole story he came to him
[1:42:20] because he was a predestinated son of
[1:42:22] God
[1:42:24] he didn't know it he had no idea but God
[1:42:26] used an angel to bring him a message and
[1:42:28] vindicate that message Amen to put him
[1:42:30] in position and then guide him Amen to a
[1:42:33] victory that was wrought by faith how
[1:42:34] did he win the victory by obeying the
[1:42:36] word of God he didn't win it by his
[1:42:39] armies he didn't win it by his might he
[1:42:41] didn't win it by his arms he didn't win
[1:42:42] it by his weapons he won that battle
[1:42:44] because he did what was illogical what
[1:42:47] he was irresponsible as a as a as a
[1:42:50] leader of a military he had thousands
[1:42:52] gathered to him and God told him to go
[1:42:53] out and find a way to sort him out and
[1:42:55] get rid of the thousands till you get
[1:42:57] down to 300 300 soldiers going out
[1:43:00] against thousands of the enemy that were
[1:43:02] better equipped and better soldiers what
[1:43:04] he did would have been deemed
[1:43:06] irresponsible if we had a leader in the
[1:43:08] Army do the same thing today and get
[1:43:10] wiped out he would be on he' be court
[1:43:15] marshaled but how did he win he didn't
[1:43:18] win by his sword he won by faith
[1:43:23] God had somebody who would stick with
[1:43:25] the word and by sticking with the word
[1:43:27] he wrought a miracle amen such a miracle
[1:43:30] amen that you would see there's
[1:43:32] something Supernatural about Gideon's
[1:43:33] leadership there's something
[1:43:35] Supernatural about this whole VI Victory
[1:43:37] something's going on amen he would come
[1:43:39] to a Moses who Moses was raised up the
[1:43:42] best that he could be raised up all
[1:43:44] kinds of accolades all kinds of
[1:43:45] abilities but then God would squish it
[1:43:47] flat send him out to the desert give him
[1:43:49] a hot tempered wife and make him a
[1:43:51] herdsman
[1:43:53] till he got to the place I don't know
[1:43:55] where he developed the stuttering I
[1:43:57] don't know if he always had it or if it
[1:43:58] happened through all of his
[1:44:01] trials gets to the point where God comes
[1:44:03] and tells him to go back into the
[1:44:04] commission go back into the word and
[1:44:06] this man says I can't even
[1:44:09] speak send somebody
[1:44:11] else I don't I'm not your man I can't do
[1:44:14] what you're asking me to
[1:44:17] do and and God I mean remember what I
[1:44:22] said about putting up with people
[1:44:26] people Moses looks at God and says I
[1:44:29] can't do it call somebody
[1:44:32] else he says no you're the one who going
[1:44:34] to do it he says well I can't I can't
[1:44:36] even speak I'm slow of tongue and I halt
[1:44:39] speech and gives him another and then he
[1:44:42] says no I send somebody God gets angry
[1:44:45] with him that's what the Bible
[1:44:48] says but he stuck with him
[1:44:53] yes Moses believed the word of God and
[1:44:56] he went according to the word of God
[1:44:58] listen Moses did not go to Egypt because
[1:45:02] he desired to go to
[1:45:04] Egypt he didn't go to Egypt because he
[1:45:07] wanted to be a hero he didn't want to go
[1:45:08] to Egypt because he wanted to look good
[1:45:10] he didn't want to go because he wanted
[1:45:11] to be the head of a Nation he didn't
[1:45:13] want to go so he had a neat story to
[1:45:15] tell his
[1:45:16] grandkids he was afraid of going he
[1:45:19] didn't want to go and he didn't think he
[1:45:21] was capable of going
[1:45:24] but yet under the word of God he obeyed
[1:45:27] the word of God and he went and God took
[1:45:29] a vessel who went not according to his
[1:45:32] own will or desire but according to the
[1:45:34] will and desire and word of God and he
[1:45:36] went out there then now now Moses is not
[1:45:39] performing his own will because he
[1:45:41] didn't want to go he's standing there
[1:45:43] only doing what God tells him to do
[1:45:45] because it's not his plan his desire his
[1:45:48] will it's all God calling him he just
[1:45:51] had something inside that could believe
[1:45:54] God and he comes down now and he and he
[1:45:57] says you're going to be a God to pharaoh
[1:45:59] and he comes down to Pharaoh he says let
[1:46:00] my people go and if you don't this is
[1:46:02] going to happen and everything Moses
[1:46:04] said happened when it came out of his
[1:46:06] mouth he had the creative power of the
[1:46:08] spoken word when God said go speak flies
[1:46:11] he spoke flies flies come into existence
[1:46:14] what was he he was a God to Pharaoh he
[1:46:17] was a God in Egypt he wasn't the God he
[1:46:20] was a minor God what was he he was a son
[1:46:22] of God who was afraid to go to Egypt
[1:46:24] thought he was too old washed up
[1:46:26] couldn't talk anymore scared to go
[1:46:30] back but inside of him was an amateur
[1:46:34] God he didn't know
[1:46:36] it he didn't can you imagine what he
[1:46:39] would think for 40 years as a failure on
[1:46:41] the back side of the
[1:46:44] desert I don't know what he thought I
[1:46:46] know what I would
[1:46:48] think he comes back and he speaks flies
[1:46:52] and he speaks frogs and he speaks
[1:46:56] hail comes to the Red
[1:46:58] Sea holds up a staff and the water
[1:47:02] separates like a wall on the right hand
[1:47:05] and a wall on the
[1:47:07] left what is it we got on the earth what
[1:47:10] is that that's an amateur
[1:47:15] God but how is he an amateure God not of
[1:47:19] his will not of his desire not of his
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:24] mind he's an amateur God when he comes
[1:47:28] back to only doing and saying what God
[1:47:30] tells him to do and
[1:47:33] say it's God working through
[1:47:37] Moses that's where Jesus was Jesus come
[1:47:40] to the Earth and and he had gifts he was
[1:47:43] full of gifts brother BR said he could
[1:47:45] have defeated uh Satan in the wilderness
[1:47:48] with all the gifts but he didn't use any
[1:47:49] of the gifts that he had he only used
[1:47:52] the word CU he was leaving us an example
[1:47:55] and he had so he had ability he had
[1:47:57] gifts but he only did what the father
[1:48:00] showed him he was God upon the Earth but
[1:48:04] in what way did he manifest being God
[1:48:06] upon the Earth he manifested through
[1:48:09] himself surrendering and yielding his
[1:48:11] submission to his father now his
[1:48:13] father's command to him he would act out
[1:48:15] and it was a manifestation of God upon
[1:48:17] the Earth speaking to the storm and
[1:48:20] speaking to the waves and and and and
[1:48:23] raising the dead what was it he was
[1:48:26] doing what his father told him to
[1:48:29] do amen
[1:48:33] I I think sometimes we get the wrong
[1:48:36] idea about what it means to be an
[1:48:38] amateur
[1:48:41] God like
[1:48:43] somehow we're just going to go do
[1:48:45] whatever we want anytime we
[1:48:48] want if we start to take a carnal
[1:48:51] self-will
[1:48:53] and start to administer the promise with
[1:48:54] a carnal self-will we're going to find
[1:48:57] that we're going to be corrupting the
[1:48:58] word of
[1:49:00] God but what God done is our day he's
[1:49:03] been so gracious to us to send a
[1:49:05] prophet to bring back the mind of God
[1:49:08] for this
[1:49:10] day to bring back lord the desire of God
[1:49:14] what he wants and the way he wants it
[1:49:16] and and restoring back the truth of the
[1:49:18] word to us that's been lost through
[1:49:20] generations and he brought that word
[1:49:22] back to us us amen and now he's
[1:49:24] unveiling the sons of God Amen by he's
[1:49:26] finding those that are righteous and
[1:49:28] what does it mean to be righteous to
[1:49:29] believe God and have it accounted to you
[1:49:31] for
[1:49:33] righteousness now he's looking for his
[1:49:35] children amen and those children are
[1:49:37] those that are able to come under the
[1:49:38] banner of this word and surrender
[1:49:40] whatever they were thinking and
[1:49:42] surrender whatever they thought was
[1:49:43] right and come in line to this word that
[1:49:46] God restored to us through a prophetic
[1:49:48] voice and what becomes the dividing line
[1:49:51] in our day the div iding line is Faith
[1:49:53] and unbelief
[1:49:55] amen I didn't make it that way God made
[1:49:58] it that
[1:50:00] way now and don't get me don't get me
[1:50:03] wrong there's more to the story there's
[1:50:05] those that'll be saved at the white
[1:50:06] Throne judgment we thank God for that
[1:50:08] grace and mercy but that's not what I'm
[1:50:09] speaking of now I'm speaking of Sons and
[1:50:11] Daughters of
[1:50:13] God the the minor Gods the amateur Gods
[1:50:17] upon the
[1:50:18] Earth brother says this all the way back
[1:50:21] in 1952 and message called believ in God
[1:50:24] he said how did God make the Earth this
[1:50:28] Earth that you're sitting on this
[1:50:29] morning people don't want to believe in
[1:50:31] faith how did God make the Earth he
[1:50:33] spoke it you see this he spoke the word
[1:50:36] come into existence in this world this
[1:50:38] morning is the spoken word of God and he
[1:50:41] believed his own
[1:50:43] word I love this statement here it is
[1:50:46] watch it and if God if you're offspring
[1:50:49] of him and God is in you you'll believe
[1:50:51] his own word he'll believe his own word
[1:50:54] that though it can't be seen felt taste
[1:50:57] or anything he'll believe it see what I
[1:50:59] mean for God in you will believe his own
[1:51:01] word is that right then you don't look
[1:51:04] at the things you see you look at the
[1:51:06] things that God said amen so God when he
[1:51:09] spoke the world Amen when we see in gen
[1:51:11] he spoke the world brother Bram comes
[1:51:13] along along and he says he had to
[1:51:14] believe his own word why because he goes
[1:51:16] all the way back Amen to the book of
[1:51:18] Hebrews that said by faith we know that
[1:51:21] the worlds were formed by the Faith Of
[1:51:23] God by faith the worlds were formed what
[1:51:24] was it it wasn't just the words it was
[1:51:27] faith in the words that created it God's
[1:51:29] Own Faith created the world amen amen
[1:51:32] because he had to believe his own word
[1:51:34] and if God has to believe his word what
[1:51:36] are the sons of God supposed to do with
[1:51:38] the word of God they have to believe the
[1:51:41] word that's what makes them sons of God
[1:51:44] that's what unveils them as sons of God
[1:51:46] what what declares that they're sons of
[1:51:48] God because they can believe the word of
[1:51:50] God and in 19 55 he says this way and do
[1:51:54] you now believe now let me tell you
[1:51:56] something each man that's born again
[1:51:58] with the spirit of God in him is a
[1:51:59] miniature
[1:52:00] Creator now that might shake you a
[1:52:03] little but that's the truth we're in the
[1:52:05] image of God God is a Creator that's the
[1:52:07] reason that you can believe that God
[1:52:09] could heal a person cuz God is in you
[1:52:11] and God made this world he just spoke
[1:52:13] and and his word become material the
[1:52:15] very ground that you're sitting on is
[1:52:17] the word of God made manifest if he
[1:52:19] didn't where did he get it see he just
[1:52:21] spoke it and it turned into existence he
[1:52:24] believed his own word and if if a man's
[1:52:27] born of the spirit of God he's an
[1:52:29] offspring of God and that part of God is
[1:52:31] in him and he believes every word that
[1:52:34] God says will materialize and so that
[1:52:36] makes him part of God the holy spirit in
[1:52:39] the man makes him part of God God had to
[1:52:42] believe his word the sons of God have to
[1:52:44] believe his word that's what identify
[1:52:46] them as sons of
[1:52:48] God
[1:52:50] Amen let's go to first John together 1
[1:52:53] John chapter
[1:53:04] 5 1 John chapter
[1:53:08] 5 verse
[1:53:14] one he
[1:53:17] says 1 John 5 verse1 whosoever believeth
[1:53:21] that Jesus is the Christ is born of God
[1:53:23] and everyone that loveth him that be
[1:53:26] that begat loveth him also that is
[1:53:28] begotten of him by this we know that we
[1:53:31] love the children of God when we love
[1:53:32] God and keep his Commandments for this
[1:53:34] is the love of God that we keep his
[1:53:36] Commandments and his Commandments are
[1:53:38] not Grievious for whosoever is born of
[1:53:40] God overcometh the world and this is the
[1:53:42] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:53:45] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:53:48] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:53:51] is the Son of God so this is the victory
[1:53:55] that overcometh the world even our faith
[1:53:57] our faith in what our faith in the word
[1:54:00] of
[1:54:01] God when you go back and look at Hebrews
[1:54:04] we go through Hebrews Abraham believed
[1:54:07] God Sarah by faith Abel by faith
[1:54:11] Everyone by Faith by Faith by faith what
[1:54:13] did they do they wrought Miracles they
[1:54:15] delivered out of the mouth of lions they
[1:54:17] the they they sent the armies to flight
[1:54:20] they vanquished enemies they did all
[1:54:22] these things how did they do it by Faith
[1:54:24] by faith in what by faith in The God Who
[1:54:26] was speaking to them that
[1:54:28] day how are we going to overcome this
[1:54:31] day by Faith by faith in what by faith
[1:54:34] in the word that's God's given us
[1:54:38] today see Adam
[1:54:42] remained an amateur God when he stayed
[1:54:46] with the word that God had given him
[1:54:48] amen but when he left the word he lost
[1:54:51] his position
[1:54:53] amen but God has given us a word this
[1:54:56] day and what's he trying to do he's
[1:54:59] trying to restore restore what restore

[1:55:07] for he's looking for his children who
[1:55:09] can say that's the truth I know it it

[1:55:26] start manifesting again the Sons and
[1:55:28] Daughters of God because the Sons and

[1:58:10] it in
[1:58:14] context God says to him a voice he said
[1:58:18] just as clear as anything said go back
[1:58:21] where you you came
[1:58:23] from amen go back so he turns around he
[1:58:26] goes back where's he going he's going
[1:58:27] into the storm he's going into
[1:58:28] destruction he's going into
[1:58:32] danger but he had learned to obey the
[1:58:35] voice it wasn't about thinking it was
[1:58:38] about
[1:58:39] obeying now it's not about his will it's
[1:58:42] about the
[1:58:44] word please follow
[1:58:46] this he goes back up to the mountain and
[1:58:50] starts to eat a sandwich cuz he doesn't
[1:58:52] know what else to do and listen he
[1:58:54] starts thinking maybe that was
[1:58:58] me you go back and listen to the way
[1:59:00] brother B says this it's amazing listen
[1:59:03] there this is a man on the earth that
[1:59:05] has more Supernatural experiences than
[1:59:06] anybody I've ever heard of in my life
[1:59:09] yeah but he never comes with that
[1:59:12] spiritual arrogancy like he always knows
[1:59:14] everything and got everything figured
[1:59:15] out and knows the answer this happened
[1:59:17] it means this and I know the
[1:59:18] interpretation of this event he never
[1:59:20] most of the time he's saying I don't
[1:59:21] really know was that me wasn't that me
[1:59:23] that could have been
[1:59:25] meise and he heard a voice an audible
[1:59:28] voice as clear as anything but he's
[1:59:29] sitting down eating a sandwich in a
[1:59:31] storm that's whirling around an old
[1:59:33] soggy sandwich that somebody made as a
[1:59:34] joke for him amen as a human being
[1:59:37] sitting on a log eating a soggy sandwich
[1:59:40] questioning whether that voice was God
[1:59:42] or
[1:59:43] not listen there's a reason I want to
[1:59:45] tell you this story I want to tell you
[1:59:47] because this whole plan of adoption and
[1:59:49] sons of God and amateur Gods this is
[1:59:51] God's plan not your plan this is God's
[1:59:53] will not your will it's not what you
[1:59:55] work yourself up to and get proud about
[1:59:57] and Shout about and get loud and get
[1:59:59] arrogant and claim it with a boldness
[2:00:01] that's not going to do anything if it's
[2:00:02] not God's will it's not going to happen
[2:00:05] God wanted to manifest something in this
[2:00:07] man and as he's running down the
[2:00:09] Saddleback amen he's running down what
[2:00:11] he calls the hog back to get down to
[2:00:12] safety God stops him in his tracks and
[2:00:14] makes him go back why because this
[2:00:17] testimony has to be told to Sons and
[2:00:19] Daughters of God in this generation so
[2:00:21] they can see what the goal
[2:00:25] is see sitting on a log eating a soggy
[2:00:28] sandwich questioning whether or not he
[2:00:30] really heard the voice of God or
[2:00:32] not I I absolutely love the honesty of
[2:00:37] God's Prophet so that we can be real
[2:00:39] people and be honest sometimes we're
[2:00:41] pretty sure God wants us to do something
[2:00:43] and then things go wrong and then we
[2:00:44] wonder if that was us or what that was
[2:00:46] God and then we feel guilty for even
[2:00:47] questioning it what's wrong with me Hey
[2:00:49] listen you're in the same category the
[2:00:51] prophet of God was in this day cuz he
[2:00:53] didn't always know what was going on and
[2:00:54] he didn't always have it figured
[2:00:57] out and what was he a manifest Son of
[2:01:00] God Amen he was the one that God was
[2:01:03] using to display what a bride coming of
[2:01:05] Christ looks
[2:01:10] like he's sitting on this
[2:01:13] log and I think if I remember the
[2:01:16] details right he tells it in a few
[2:01:17] places but he gets up and he's got a
[2:01:20] scope listen he's got his scope under
[2:01:22] his coat so it doesn't fog up in case he
[2:01:25] runs into a bear or something during the
[2:01:29] storm you know he's not walking around
[2:01:31] like an amateur God waiting for a bear
[2:01:33] to
[2:01:34] come no he's got his gun tucked under
[2:01:37] his coat in case he runs into a bear so
[2:01:38] he can shoot it defend
[2:01:41] himself he's a human being who happens
[2:01:44] to be a Son of
[2:01:48] God there's a reality in all of thisen
[2:01:53] said I don't know about you but I am so
[2:01:55] sick of fake put on trying to be
[2:02:01] spiritual the experience and brother B
[2:02:03] had and the experiences we've had in our
[2:02:04] Liv they were real they were
[2:02:06] Supernatural God did it it wasn't a put
[2:02:08] on and it wasn't trying to massage
[2:02:10] something into something to look like
[2:02:11] something
[2:02:14] spiritual it was the real
[2:02:17] deal when God moves it's real that's
[2:02:20] right it's what I'm one is
[2:02:24] real gets up to go I believe how the
[2:02:27] story goes and God tells him to go back
[2:02:30] or not go don't remember the second time
[2:02:33] then a voice
[2:02:34] comes says aren't I the god of creation
[2:02:37] aren't I the god that still the waters
[2:02:38] and the waves and the wind and he says a
[2:02:41] few things like that and brother B says
[2:02:43] yes God I believe
[2:02:46] you he says you
[2:02:49] speak the storm will obey you
[2:02:52] you
[2:02:53] speak listen God could have spoke God
[2:02:56] could have done like he did with Moses
[2:02:58] put the words right in his mouth say you
[2:02:59] go call now this was
[2:03:01] different God says you speak and now
[2:03:04] here's a man a human being who was
[2:03:07] afraid of the storm afraid of dying in
[2:03:09] the storm and being cautious about maybe
[2:03:11] running into bears in the
[2:03:15] storm man strains himself up and he
[2:03:19] begins to speak out of human lips out
[2:03:21] out of a man who just ate a soggy onion
[2:03:24] and a bunch of other stuffed
[2:03:26] sandwich like I want this to be so real
[2:03:29] I want it to be as real as it really
[2:03:32] is this man stands up after finishing a
[2:03:35] soggy sandwich and hears the voice of
[2:03:37] God and he says Cloud storm you go away
[2:03:42] go back where you came from sun come out
[2:03:44] and Shine for 4 days while we're on our
[2:03:46] hunting trip said just then the wind
[2:03:48] that was swirling begin to change change
[2:03:51] direction and softened and then just a
[2:03:53] few more whisp of wind and then it blew
[2:03:55] the C clouds away and and the sun
[2:03:57] started shining and and then a voice
[2:03:59] told him won't you walk with me and and
[2:04:01] brother brandham starts walking Amen in
[2:04:04] this experience with God Amen what did
[2:04:06] he just do he just did the same thing
[2:04:09] Jesus Christ did when he stood on the
[2:04:10] bow of the boat and said peace be still
[2:04:12] and the winds and the waves obeyed him
[2:04:14] what was that that was God in flesh that
[2:04:17] was Jesus Christ amen the the Son of God
[2:04:20] now what do we have at the end time we
[2:04:22] have a son of God Amen we have we have a
[2:04:24] man a human being amen with a
[2:04:27] predestinated position in God and God by
[2:04:29] his own will directs the man through the
[2:04:31] storm and tells him now you speak amen
[2:04:34] but listen to me that man who spoke to
[2:04:37] that storm had to believe that that
[2:04:39] storm was going to go away or that storm
[2:04:41] was not going to move because when God
[2:04:44] spoke the word amen creation didn't
[2:04:46] start molding itself into what he said
[2:04:48] unless he believed the word amen that
[2:04:51] storm was wasn't going anywhere if that
[2:04:53] man wasn't so convinced in that voice
[2:04:55] that spoke to him that that storm was
[2:04:57] going to go he spoke and Faith moved the
[2:04:59] clouds
[2:05:01] away who said it listen it's so
[2:05:04] important he wasn't repeating what God
[2:05:06] told him to repeat he was saying he was
[2:05:09] speaking of his own accord because he
[2:05:11] had permission to
[2:05:14] speak this is power over
[2:05:18] creation forces is like a blizzard in a
[2:05:20] storm and the and I mean these are huge
[2:05:23] forces and Powerful forces and he was
[2:05:25] moving it by his spoken word what was it
[2:05:28] it was a manifestation of an amateur God
[2:05:31] on
[2:05:33] Earth listen that wasn't only for
[2:05:37] him God has more children on the
[2:05:45] earth oh
[2:05:48] my somehow I believe that promis is from
[2:05:51] for me
[2:05:55] too but you know what I have to believe
[2:05:58] it I can't be guessing at it or hoping
[2:06:01] it but I have to
[2:06:02] believe I have to believe what do you
[2:06:05] have to believe Chad I I don't believe
[2:06:08] that I have to figure out what is the
[2:06:10] right thing to do in a situation and
[2:06:12] then use my own presumption to try to to
[2:06:15] say something and make it happen I've
[2:06:17] tried that too many times and wound up
[2:06:19] disappointed
[2:06:23] but I believe that I'm a Son of God why
[2:06:26] do you believe that Chad I I really
[2:06:28] can't show you any reason why I can't
[2:06:31] show you my Merit or conduct or anything
[2:06:33] but all I can do is say there's a
[2:06:34] witness in my heart that I believe this
[2:06:36] message is the truth like not just
[2:06:39] believe it's true but I actually believe
[2:06:41] I'm part of it that I'm connected to it
[2:06:43] in a deep way that's beyond my thinking
[2:06:46] but there's a deep connection to the
[2:06:48] truth of this word inside of me and I
[2:06:50] believe that that's my position also as
[2:06:52] a Son of
[2:06:55] God but I don't believe it's for me to
[2:06:58] use this peanut of a brain to try to
[2:07:00] figure out when to speak to a storm and
[2:07:01] when not to speak to a
[2:07:04] storm I think it's for me to take my
[2:07:07] position like the prophet did and take
[2:07:09] my position like brother brandham did
[2:07:11] and like Jesus Christ did and stay
[2:07:14] behind the word and wait for God to tell
[2:07:17] me when to speak or when to move because
[2:07:19] if God does then the faith in my my
[2:07:21] heart shall rise and say that's nothing
[2:07:23] but the truth and it will move by faith
[2:07:26] not the force of my
[2:07:28] words it doesn't matter how dogmatic you
[2:07:30] are and how angry you get at the Devil
[2:07:32] and how much you scream and how forceful
[2:07:34] you Screech Screech out of scripture if
[2:07:36] you don't believe it in your heart
[2:07:38] nothing's
[2:07:41] happening these things are all had by
[2:07:44] faith and listen you look at Hebrews 11
[2:07:48] by faith they subdued armies by faith
[2:07:50] they quenched the Fire by by faith they
[2:07:53] stopped the mountains of line by Faith
[2:07:55] by Faith by faith but it was by faith
[2:07:57] that won the victory by faith that
[2:07:59] brought the conception by faith that
[2:08:01] that that gave the Revelation by faith
[2:08:03] all of this was done but it was also
[2:08:05] that same faith that caused them to be
[2:08:07] clothed in Goat skins and and sheep
[2:08:09] skins and be chased amen from cave to
[2:08:11] cave and be destitute and Afflicted they
[2:08:14] were able to take the good and the bad
[2:08:16] by faith and their faith didn't diminish
[2:08:19] whether they were vanquishing and Army
[2:08:22] stopping the mouths of lions are being
[2:08:23] chased from a cave to a cave the faith
[2:08:26] didn't change they still believe the
[2:08:27] word of
[2:08:32] God these were the superheroes of Faith
[2:08:36] the super race the sup
[2:08:39] seed and they believed even when they
[2:08:41] were destitute and Afflicted they still
[2:08:47] believed Jesus or the scripture says
[2:08:52] no not that scripture sorry I want to
[2:08:55] read a couple quotes out of adoption and
[2:08:57] I'm going to close I'm closing with this
[2:08:59] thought he said but in the fullness of
[2:09:02] time this is adoption part four from
[2:09:03] 1960 the fullness of time God sent his
[2:09:06] own in his own good time Jesus the lamb
[2:09:09] slain from the foundation of the world
[2:09:11] his blood was shed that I might go to my
[2:09:13] inheritance to be what what inheritance
[2:09:15] to sunship to be a Son of God what is my
[2:09:19] inheritance sunship
[2:09:21] he says now he says' and now this may
[2:09:23] just choke you to death but do you know
[2:09:26] that men that are sons of God are
[2:09:28] amateur Gods amen amen listen do you
[2:09:30] believe that's your position do you
[2:09:32] believe you could do you believe that
[2:09:34] you could speak to the storm in Colorado
[2:09:36] and it would go away I believe it but I
[2:09:40] don't know when and I don't know how and
[2:09:41] when it's appropriate I'm going to need
[2:09:43] God somehow to let me know because if I
[2:09:45] go out there and try to do it I'm going
[2:09:47] to know deep in my heart this is just me
[2:09:49] trying to prove something or me trying
[2:09:51] to do something and it's going to fail
[2:09:52] miserably because it has to be done by
[2:09:55] faith it can't be my effort and it can't
[2:09:58] be and and it can't be for false motives
[2:10:01] I can't be going out trying to vindicate
[2:10:03] myself or attract a crowd or draw
[2:10:05] attention or become something better
[2:10:07] than the next one that's not going to
[2:10:08] work that's all self-motivated that is
[2:10:11] not an amateur God an amateur that's a
[2:10:13] false
[2:10:19] god but do you know that men that are
[2:10:21] sons of God are amateur Gods how many
[2:10:24] ever know that how many knows that Jesus
[2:10:26] said
[2:10:27] so by the Bible said Jesus said did you
[2:10:30] not your law say itself that you are
[2:10:32] gods and if you call them Gods which God
[2:10:35] said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods
[2:10:37] because they had full dominion over the
[2:10:39] Dominion of the world he gave them
[2:10:40] dominion over all things and he lost his
[2:10:43] godship he lost his sunship he lost his
[2:10:45] dominion and Satan took it over but
[2:10:47] brother we are waiting for the
[2:10:48] manifestation of the sons of God who
[2:10:50] will come back back and take it over
[2:10:52] again waiting for the fullness of time
[2:10:54] when the pyramid gets up to the top when
[2:10:56] the full sons of God will be manifested
[2:10:59] when the power of God will walk out
[2:11:01] Hallelujah and will take every Power
[2:11:03] that Satan's got away from him yes sir
[2:11:05] it belongs to him he's the logos that
[2:11:08] went out of God that is true that was
[2:11:10] the son of God then he made man that
[2:11:13] little God and he said if they call
[2:11:16] those who the word of God come to
[2:11:18] prophets if they call them Gods who the
[2:11:20] word of God come to and God said so
[2:11:22] himself that they were Gods he told
[2:11:24] Moses I made you a God and made Aaron
[2:11:26] your Prophet amen he said I may act like
[2:11:30] a religious crank but I'm not and when
[2:11:31] your eyes come open and see these things
[2:11:33] all right he made man a god a God in his
[2:11:37] dominion and his Dominion goes from sea
[2:11:39] to Sea and from Shore to Shore he has
[2:11:41] control of it and when Jesus came being
[2:11:44] the one God with without
[2:11:47] sin uh he proved it when the winds
[2:11:49] blowed peace be still and when the the
[2:11:51] tree he said no man eat from thee verily
[2:11:53] I say unto you you that's little Gods if
[2:11:57] you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:11:59] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:12:01] that what you said will come to pass you
[2:12:03] can have what you said this is what
[2:12:05] Jesus said Jesus cursed the Fig Tree
[2:12:08] amen when he cursed the tree they came
[2:12:09] back the next day he was cursed and they
[2:12:10] were astonished and he says don't be
[2:12:12] astonished amen if if you believe in
[2:12:14] your heart say unto this mountain be
[2:12:16] plucked up and cast to The Sea and don't
[2:12:17] doubt in your heart you shall have what
[2:12:19] you said
[2:12:21] Jesus was putting it on the basis of
[2:12:23] Faith amen back in adoption he says go
[2:12:28] right back to Genesis to the original
[2:12:30] what is it now the world and the nature
[2:12:32] is groaning crying everything's a moving
[2:12:35] why for the manifestation of the sons of
[2:12:37] God when the true Sons born Sons filled
[2:12:40] Sons speak and their word is backed I
[2:12:43] believe we're on the border of it right
[2:12:45] now yes sir say to this mountain let it
[2:12:48] be so brother I desire so and so a
[2:12:51] certain thing done I'm a Believer in
[2:12:53] Jesus Christ I give it to you in the
[2:12:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:12:57] there's a manifestation oh brother my
[2:12:59] crops are burning up out y I haven't had
[2:13:01] any rain I'll send you rain in the name
[2:13:03] of the Lord God bless your crop oh
[2:13:05] waiting groaning all nature waiting for
[2:13:08] the manifestation of the sons of God God
[2:13:10] ordained it at the beginning he gave man
[2:13:13] the Dominion brother B this is 1960 he's
[2:13:16] telling us this is where we're coming
[2:13:18] back
[2:13:19] to in 196 60 he didn't have this
[2:13:22] experience yet of the mountain in
[2:13:24] Colorado he never had spoke to the storm
[2:13:27] amen he never had had that experience
[2:13:29] but he's already preaching this in 1960
[2:13:31] that this is where man's coming
[2:13:33] to now there's just a couple more quotes
[2:13:35] that I want to read he said now in
[2:13:38] perfect
[2:13:39] Faith this is also
[2:13:41] 1963 this is before he has the incident
[2:13:45] and on the mountain in Colorado that
[2:13:48] happens in the fall of 1963 I think it's
[2:13:51] October this is in August says and and
[2:13:54] now we're going to turn to Mark St Mark
[2:13:56] 11th chapter we're going to begin
[2:13:58] reading at the 22nd verse and many of
[2:14:01] you know the scripture it's very
[2:14:02] familiar it was a scripture I was
[2:14:04] thinking on brother Russell when he
[2:14:05] spoke to me and said about those
[2:14:06] squirrels and they was just the very
[2:14:08] scripture I was thinking on it's always
[2:14:10] been a puzzle he said if ye say not if I
[2:14:13] say if you say and what scripture did he
[2:14:16] go to right to the one where Jesus says
[2:14:18] if you say to this mountain be plucked
[2:14:19] up and cast to The Sea and doubt not in
[2:14:21] your heart here's brother brandom
[2:14:24] sitting up against a tree and he say
[2:14:26] he's thinking about this scripture see
[2:14:28] he said he always puzzled over it he
[2:14:31] just wasn't sure about it he was
[2:14:33] questioning it he was thinking about it
[2:14:34] meditating on it and God come down to
[2:14:37] him and God says you can
[2:14:41] speak and brother B says what do I say
[2:14:44] and I'm just paraphrasing you know I'm
[2:14:45] paraphrasing I don't have all the
[2:14:46] details he says what do I say he says
[2:14:48] well you're
[2:14:49] hunting you have an any
[2:14:52] squirrels you need squirrels and then
[2:14:55] brother brandom now he says I want a
[2:14:57] squirrel to come from here to there and
[2:14:59] over there he he says three squirrels
[2:15:01] and he and he and the squirrels are
[2:15:03] created Amen brother Brenham tells us
[2:15:05] this is something that didn't even
[2:15:06] happen in Jesus's Ministry because when
[2:15:08] Jesus broke the bread and the fish he
[2:15:10] had something and broke it and it
[2:15:11] multiplied this was creating squirrels
[2:15:13] where there were no squirrels what are
[2:15:15] we seeing we're seeing an amateur God on
[2:15:17] the
[2:15:19] earth amen
[2:15:21] yes but this amateur God on the earth
[2:15:24] didn't say you know what I would like to
[2:15:27] have some squirrels God I want scoll no
[2:15:30] God come down and directed him and told
[2:15:32] him what to say to me this is my opinion
[2:15:35] I believe that's why brother Brenham had
[2:15:37] the faith to produce the
[2:15:40] squirrels because God spoke to
[2:15:44] him listen to how he says this in 61
[2:15:47] there's a couple quotes that I want to
[2:15:49] tie into the way I'm thinking what I'm
[2:15:51] preaching right now to to help formulate
[2:15:54] my understanding he said now all the
[2:15:58] power that'll rais us up is right in us
[2:16:01] now we are now in Heavenly places we are
[2:16:04] now the power in the power of the
[2:16:06] Resurrection if there wasn't a law to
[2:16:08] that Sons and Daughters of God would
[2:16:10] create them a world out there and go
[2:16:11] live a private life on it you have the
[2:16:14] power in you to do it if you've got a
[2:16:16] shadow of the power of God in you you
[2:16:18] got power to do it God is omnipotent see
[2:16:21] what I mean the power that's in you you
[2:16:24] could speak a world into existence and
[2:16:26] go live on it Hallelujah there you are
[2:16:28] do you believe that's true amen but
[2:16:31] here's where he qualifies it that's what
[2:16:34] power is in the church now but it is
[2:16:36] controlled by a law and that law is not
[2:16:40] keeping a bunch of Commandments it's the
[2:16:42] law of Faith Jesus said all things are
[2:16:44] possible to them that believe and if you
[2:16:46] can believe it whatever God will lead
[2:16:49] your soul to believe that is
[2:16:52] yours if you can believe it if God can
[2:16:55] lead your soul to believe it if you
[2:16:57] believe it from the soul and God can
[2:16:59] lead your soul to believe it it's yours
[2:17:02] if you've got a mental workup or
[2:17:03] conception amen that's not the same
[2:17:05] thing but if God can lead your soul to
[2:17:07] believe it then it's
[2:17:10] yours every place The Souls of your foot
[2:17:12] can set upon by faith God gives it to
[2:17:15] you amen it's yours you possess it if
[2:17:17] you can find the key to this law of
[2:17:19] faith that opens it to you
[2:17:21] you see what I mean the power is
[2:17:23] controlled if you are a son of God you
[2:17:25] are a daughter of God that never leaves
[2:17:27] you it's with you all the
[2:17:30] time
[2:17:33] amen you mean the power to create
[2:17:35] another world is in me yes all the
[2:17:39] time the power to speak squirrels into
[2:17:42] existence was with brother brandham all
[2:17:44] the time prise God but he didn't do it
[2:17:46] all the time he did it when God gave him
[2:17:49] the key of Faith to unlocked that and
[2:17:51] when God spoke to him and unlocked a
[2:17:53] faith in his soul God LED his soul to
[2:17:55] believe it he spoke it it came to
[2:17:59] pass if you can find the key to this law
[2:18:05] now I want to go down to a question
[2:18:06] somebody asked brother bham after the
[2:18:09] seals in 1964 questions and answers they
[2:18:12] asked him this question they said this
[2:18:14] the third pull and is speaking the word
[2:18:18] it seems entirely possible for you to
[2:18:20] speak the word word and one would be
[2:18:22] completely and fully restored placed
[2:18:24] entirely ready for the Rapture in the
[2:18:26] Resurrection the son of man this is or
[2:18:30] is it not and you would do this if
[2:18:32] properly pressed upon would you not
[2:18:35] Escape all these things Escape all these
[2:18:37] things and stand before the son of man
[2:18:39] the quote of scripture Luke 21:36 now
[2:18:41] here's brother brenham's answer my dear
[2:18:44] friend now I think here that you got you
[2:18:47] got a good statement yes sir yes sir now
[2:18:51] that would be so so brother bandam in
[2:18:53] other
[2:18:54] words uh I'm not going to polish up what
[2:18:57] you said but I believe I can make it a
[2:18:59] little clearer to the people you're
[2:19:01] believing because of the spoken words
[2:19:03] and things like that that he said about
[2:19:05] and all of you here witness to squirrels
[2:19:07] and all these other things that's been
[2:19:08] done did you notice that was sovereignly
[2:19:12] given I never asked him Lord let me do
[2:19:16] this speak these things and like that do
[2:19:18] these things there I never asked him
[2:19:20] that he by his own Divine will came to
[2:19:23] me and said you go do this see I wasn't
[2:19:26] asking one thing about it Moses never
[2:19:29] asked to go down in Egypt but was God it
[2:19:32] was God that sent him down to Egypt see
[2:19:35] now I believe that the Holy Spirit would
[2:19:36] come to me and say in a vision go tell
[2:19:38] certain certain person that they are not
[2:19:41] they're trying to overcome a certain
[2:19:42] thing and they cannot do it they're
[2:19:44] smoking they're drinking they're they're
[2:19:47] stealing or committing adultery whatever
[2:19:49] it might be or they got lustful spirit
[2:19:51] and you just go where they are and you
[2:19:53] say thou Spirit come out of there I set
[2:19:55] this captive free would it take place
[2:19:58] absolutely yes indeed it absolutely
[2:20:00] would it' take place but now upon my own
[2:20:03] presuming now presume means to venture
[2:20:06] without Authority I'd go down there to
[2:20:08] help this person I'm just presuming that
[2:20:10] it'll be all right then I don't know I
[2:20:13] can call the name of the Lord over them
[2:20:15] I can pray for them do whatever I wish
[2:20:18] if I had my own way this morning I just
[2:20:20] hadn't interview with this little lady
[2:20:21] sitting here in the wheelchair to come
[2:20:23] to this meeting today they had to have
[2:20:25] the fire department take her out of her
[2:20:26] house in Chicago and people live across
[2:20:28] the street and don't come to the meeting
[2:20:30] see what would I do if it was in my
[2:20:33] power I have the authority to do it but
[2:20:36] I have to wait for orders to do
[2:20:40] it see I have the authority from God to
[2:20:42] do it but now when he gives the orders
[2:20:45] she'd go back home
[2:20:47] well now that is the truth I'd just be
[2:20:49] as willing to die die this morning is
[2:20:52] I'd be in anything that's the truth but
[2:20:54] first you see no one even Jesus himself
[2:20:57] said the son of man can do nothing in
[2:20:58] himself but what he seeth the father do
[2:21:00] that doeth the son likewise we know that
[2:21:02] St John 159 all right the son does
[2:21:04] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[2:21:07] father doing that the son will do
[2:21:09] likewise all right all right we got it
[2:21:14] listen I believe with all my heart that
[2:21:17] God is calling for the manifestation of
[2:21:19] the sons of God that the whole Earth
[2:21:20] Earth is groaning for what are we seeing
[2:21:22] earthquakes and fires and wars and pest
[2:21:24] what is going on in the news all around
[2:21:26] us this Earth is groaning and travail
[2:21:29] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:21:31] they want the amateur Gods to come back
[2:21:33] to their
[2:21:34] position the Earth hasn't been right
[2:21:36] since the amateur God lost his position
[2:21:39] and the Earth is going to come right one
[2:21:41] day and the Millennium is going to be a
[2:21:42] glorious reign with the amateurs of God
[2:21:44] the amateur Gods connected with their
[2:21:46] King Jesus back on Earth the bride and
[2:21:48] the bridegroom back on Earth again and
[2:21:50] ruling and
[2:21:52] reigning amen but God is building our
[2:21:54] faith and he's bringing us back into
[2:21:56] this position and he's brought the he's
[2:21:58] restored the word to increase our faith
[2:22:00] listen I tell you what no matter what
[2:22:03] happens you got to have the faith for it
[2:22:04] to happen and if a voice comes and
[2:22:06] speaks to you and says I've you're in
[2:22:09] need right now you need this speak it it
[2:22:11] will happen if you have no faith down
[2:22:13] inside of you you'll hear a voice and
[2:22:15] you just question the voice and you
[2:22:16] don't know what you should do and you
[2:22:18] pass it over because you start looking
[2:22:19] at yourself
[2:22:22] amen but oh God if this message has woke
[2:22:25] us up to who we really are if it's taken
[2:22:28] our identity and placed us back in God
[2:22:31] back in the mind of God as Sons and
[2:22:33] Daughters of God restored the truth back
[2:22:35] to us and raised our faith to a place
[2:22:38] that when God calls for it we can speak
[2:22:40] and it can
[2:22:41] happen not of our presumption but of his
[2:22:44] will not of our will but of his it's a
[2:22:47] surrender to his will but there's got to
[2:22:49] be a faith who we are we've got to
[2:22:52] believe that we are going to be the
[2:22:54] amateur Gods on this Earth that God's
[2:22:56] called us as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:22:57] to be amateur
[2:23:01] Gods amen and when brother Bram talks
[2:23:05] about speaking to somebody and they
[2:23:07] would be totally restored and ready for
[2:23:09] the Rapture or however it's worded that
[2:23:11] way he says yes that's true but that was
[2:23:14] sovereignly given I never asked for
[2:23:16] those things God just told me to say and
[2:23:19] if he told me to say and I said it it
[2:23:20] would be absolutely exactly that
[2:23:23] way he believed it he believed when God
[2:23:27] told him to create squirrels he believed
[2:23:28] it he spoke he created squirrels told
[2:23:31] him to speak to the storm he told him
[2:23:32] about his wife's tumor he believed it
[2:23:35] before he spoke to that that that to
[2:23:38] that tumor when he spoke it happened
[2:23:40] before he was praying oh God uh help my
[2:23:43] poor wife Lord should we have the
[2:23:45] surgery should we not have the surgery
[2:23:49] uh yes
[2:23:51] amen Lord you know what he's praying
[2:23:54] Lord if they could just put it off till
[2:23:55] after the holiday so we could get back
[2:23:57] here and then then go
[2:24:01] back what's he praying like he's praying
[2:24:03] just like you and I
[2:24:05] pray just like you and I who who don't
[2:24:08] have perfect understanding of the will
[2:24:09] of God we don't know what God wants to
[2:24:10] do in this situation we just believe his
[2:24:12] word is true we believe he'll heal us We
[2:24:14] Believe by a Stripes you're healed we
[2:24:15] believe that but that that he Health all
[2:24:18] of our diseases and we keep confessing
[2:24:19] our faith in word as God works out
[2:24:21] healing in our life but he's down
[2:24:23] praying just like you and I would pray
[2:24:25] praying for his poor wife praying for
[2:24:26] the examination that day praying that
[2:24:28] the timing would work out well and and
[2:24:30] and all of these things and all at once
[2:24:32] God said stand to your
[2:24:33] feet and he stood
[2:24:37] up and he says you speak and as you say
[2:24:40] is what it will be he says before the
[2:24:42] doctors touch her amen amen before the
[2:24:45] doctors touch her it'll be gone what was
[2:24:48] that that was an amateur God speaking on
[2:24:51] the
[2:24:52] Earthen she went to the appointment laid
[2:24:54] on the table and she said as the doctor
[2:24:56] just before he put his hand she felt
[2:24:58] something cool sweep over her body as
[2:25:00] just as the doctor was going to examine
[2:25:02] her and he examined her and said and he
[2:25:03] said sister brandom I can't find one
[2:25:05] trace of that tumor what was it an
[2:25:07] amateur God spoke on the Earth but he
[2:25:10] didn't do it presumptuously he was
[2:25:12] praying like you and I pray he was
[2:25:14] holding on to the promise of God he was
[2:25:16] believing that God would move for his
[2:25:18] wife amen but then God amen come on the
[2:25:21] scene and said this is going to be
[2:25:23] different than that you're going to
[2:25:24] speak it
[2:25:31] yourself praise God you know what this
[2:25:34] is this is the
[2:25:37] reality this is real this is not
[2:25:40] presumption this is not trying this is
[2:25:43] just holding on with faith and believing
[2:25:45] and waiting for God to do
[2:25:47] something brother B when he said that
[2:25:49] quote about the one we just read
[2:25:51] answering the person's question about
[2:25:52] can you speak to somebody they'd be
[2:25:54] whole and restore yes that absolutely
[2:25:56] that'd be the
[2:25:57] truth he said now this little woman here
[2:25:59] if I had my choice she'd be healed he
[2:26:02] says now I can pray for her I can call
[2:26:05] the name of the Lord over her I can
[2:26:07] believe that's the reality that's where
[2:26:10] we're at we can take God at his word we
[2:26:12] can say God I believe your word you said
[2:26:14] by your stripes I'm Healed and I'm
[2:26:15] holding on to that word and listen it
[2:26:18] works friends we believe the word of God
[2:26:19] and God manifest that
[2:26:21] word but I don't know how he's going to
[2:26:24] do it I don't know what method he's
[2:26:25] going to use to do it I just know he's
[2:26:27] going to do
[2:26:28] it and I'm waiting with faith until he
[2:26:31] does it believing in the promised word
[2:26:33] of God but there's a time and a place
[2:26:36] where God can come down and use your
[2:26:38] voice amen and speak things into
[2:26:41] existence speak realities speak because
[2:26:43] why because you're amateur Sons and
[2:26:46] Daughters of God but how's it going to
[2:26:48] work the same way it worked with Jesus
[2:26:50] in the same way it worked with brother
[2:26:51] brandom Jesus never did anything unless
[2:26:54] his father showed
[2:26:59] him if I could just come to the point I
[2:27:02] think it's the point I don't even
[2:27:06] know what's it going to take to get to
[2:27:08] this place where God can speak through
[2:27:11] our lips as amateur Sons and Daughters
[2:27:13] of
[2:27:15] God I don't really think it's going to
[2:27:17] take
[2:27:18] us getting a whole lot more bold or loud
[2:27:23] or I think it's going to take a greater
[2:27:29] submission I think what God's Building
[2:27:31] us to is a greater
[2:27:34] obedience a greater
[2:27:38] surrender more of laying our ideas down
[2:27:42] and sticking with his word more of
[2:27:45] surrendering our wants to his will am
[2:27:49] yes
[2:27:50] what's he doing he's shaping us he's
[2:27:52] molding us he's making us does he want
[2:27:56] to display himself through us I believe
[2:27:58] that I do believe that there's many
[2:28:01] things brother Brenham says about the
[2:28:03] squeeze and the last moments of time and
[2:28:05] the bride and the manifestations in the
[2:28:07] third pole there's so many things he
[2:28:09] says that looks like there could be an
[2:28:11] amazing time upon this Earth through the
[2:28:13] bride do you believe that you heard
[2:28:16] those I don't I'm not even trying to
[2:28:18] project what will happen or how will
[2:28:20] happen or what the circumstance or the I
[2:28:21] don't even know all I know is he keeps
[2:28:24] alluding to this over and over again you
[2:28:27] read Look Away to Jesus and some of
[2:28:28] these messages like that he keep
[2:28:30] alluding to it and so what's it going to
[2:28:32] take it's not going to be me deciding
[2:28:34] it's time now for that to manifest and
[2:28:35] me going out and bulldozing my way
[2:28:37] through and making it that's not going
[2:28:38] to be brother brandham never did that
[2:28:40] Jesus didn't do that Moses didn't do it
[2:28:42] Gideon didn't do it tell me who did
[2:28:45] it go through the Heroes of Faith go
[2:28:48] through the example we have in our day
[2:28:50] look at Jesus Christ you know what I
[2:28:52] think we need I think we need to lay
[2:28:53] down our lives more than we ever have I
[2:28:55] think we need to give up our thinking
[2:28:57] more than we ever have I think we need
[2:28:58] to come back to this word and the word
[2:29:00] only and stop with all the other voices
[2:29:03] and
[2:29:03] nonsense and come back and say God
[2:29:06] you've got a voice in this day you
[2:29:07] brought a word in this day I believe it
[2:29:09] I accept it I stick with it I surrender
[2:29:12] all my thinking to have this
[2:29:15] word praise be to
[2:29:17] God I Surrender
[2:29:20] not I did or I have or I can or I will
[2:29:24] but God I
[2:29:26] Surrender whatever you want whatever you
[2:29:29] say the way you want it the timing you
[2:29:32] want it the way you want it I believe
[2:29:34] you I believe your word I believe it's
[2:29:36] true I believe you're going to do Mighty
[2:29:37] things I believe you want to use me and
[2:29:39] I'm here and I'm available whenever you
[2:29:47] say I don't I just don't see
[2:29:51] I just don't see a bold arrogant
[2:29:55] humanistic approach to the manifestation
[2:29:58] of the third
[2:29:59] pool I think it's going to be an utter
[2:30:02] humility and
[2:30:03] simplicity just like it was with the
[2:30:05] prophet of
[2:30:07] God do I believe in a bold faith in the
[2:30:10] promises of God yes grab a hold of it
[2:30:12] and hold it like we preach Wednesday
[2:30:13] night God said it I believe it and I
[2:30:16] believe it's for me I'm one of them get
[2:30:17] a hold of it and hold on to it until it
[2:30:19] comes to pass but when it comes to this
[2:30:22] other level of
[2:30:24] speaking into
[2:30:26] existence don't play with that
[2:30:29] presumptuously let God
[2:30:32] order his
[2:30:34] word in the message why are people so
[2:30:36] tossed about he makes this statement
[2:30:39] some people gets this wrong impression
[2:30:41] of what the anointing is do you ever
[2:30:43] think of that when when was the greatest
[2:30:46] anointing ever give to anyone and what
[2:30:49] did they do when they had the the
[2:30:51] anointing the greatest anointing that
[2:30:54] was ever given to anyone was Jesus
[2:30:56] Christ we have the spirit by measure he
[2:30:59] had it without measure and one day he
[2:31:02] went and entered into a temple and
[2:31:03] picked up the scroll and read the spirit
[2:31:05] of God is upon me for Heath anointed me
[2:31:07] to preach the acceptable year to bind up
[2:31:10] the broken hearts to heal the sick to
[2:31:11] give sight to the Blind and now we would
[2:31:14] think if such an anointing was on him
[2:31:17] that that been prophesied 800 years
[2:31:20] before that it would come and here he
[2:31:22] was with that type of anointing the full
[2:31:24] blessing and anointing of the Lord upon
[2:31:26] him we would want to run all over the
[2:31:28] building scream and holler but the Bible
[2:31:30] said he laid down the Scrolls sat down
[2:31:32] and precious words proceeded out of his
[2:31:35] mouth that's what he done under the
[2:31:39] anointing why because that's what God
[2:31:41] wanted done under that
[2:31:44] anointing listen the anointing is not a
[2:31:47] motion the anointing is supreme power in
[2:31:51] control Hallelujah like knowing exactly
[2:31:55] what and how see and that's what's there
[2:31:59] you know what an anointing is supreme
[2:32:01] power under control like knowing how and
[2:32:03] what amen not not going around saying I
[2:32:06] don't know what he was I don't know how
[2:32:07] but I guess it this way and I'm going
[2:32:09] for it no that's not it Su the anointing
[2:32:12] is supreme power under control knowing
[2:32:15] how and what with no doubt in your heart
[2:32:17] whatsoever if brother brandham said if
[2:32:19] that voice spoke to me and told me to go
[2:32:21] raise up I mean George Washington I'd
[2:32:23] invite all the press and come down he
[2:32:24] had faith in that voice because he saw
[2:32:27] it work that was his faith that was
[2:32:29] working not a bit of presumption to it
[2:32:32] now he said he can't go down there and
[2:32:34] just raise up George Washington brother
[2:32:35] Bram could even pray for people and
[2:32:37] called them delivered he could pray but
[2:32:39] he couldn't do it unless God told him on
[2:32:41] the platform he said go be healed in
[2:32:42] jesus' name go be well in jesus' name he
[2:32:44] never declared them healed unless God
[2:32:46] showed him that they were healed
[2:32:50] he believed the word he confessed the
[2:32:52] word he stood with the word but when it
[2:32:54] come time to go raise Abraham Lincoln or
[2:32:56] George Washington from the grave he was
[2:32:58] going to wait for God to tell him that
[2:32:59] he wasn't going to go
[2:33:03] presumptuously the anointing is supreme
[2:33:06] power under control hallelujah amen
[2:33:10] knowing how and what God has revealed
[2:33:13] his word to us there's so many things we
[2:33:15] know how and what on why because of the
[2:33:17] prophet's Ministry we know how to
[2:33:19] conduct ourselves we know how to get
[2:33:20] married we know when not to get married
[2:33:22] we know how to act in church we know we
[2:33:24] know so many things we know how and what
[2:33:27] why because he brought us his word
[2:33:28] through a prophet we know how and what
[2:33:31] we know the truth of the word we know
[2:33:33] how to do things we know what to do in
[2:33:34] many many cases and now you can stand on
[2:33:37] with bold faith and believe that God's
[2:33:38] going to move on
[2:33:41] it supreme power in control that's the
[2:33:48] anointing praise God
[2:33:52] in the fourth seal this is the last
[2:33:53] quote I'm going to read in the fourth
[2:33:55] seal this is the way brother benam says
[2:33:57] it I believe that sin will be broke up
[2:34:00] and when it's confessed upon the bases
[2:34:02] of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like
[2:34:03] dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch
[2:34:05] of chlorox bleach it just breaks it into
[2:34:08] chemicals and sends it plumb back to
[2:34:09] where it come from see and that's the
[2:34:11] way the blood of Jesus Christ does and
[2:34:14] that sets a man across the chasm again
[2:34:16] as a Son of God see and then he's he
[2:34:19] becomes the even he's the creative power
[2:34:23] of God is in him and at least whenever
[2:34:26] God can command it to be done it'll be
[2:34:29] done this is in the fourth seal then the
[2:34:32] creative power of God is in him and and
[2:34:35] at least whenever God can command it to
[2:34:38] be done it'll be
[2:34:40] done you know what I want more than
[2:34:42] anything I want to be under an
[2:34:44] anointing supreme power in control I
[2:34:48] want his word have control of my daily
[2:34:51] life I want this message that he brought
[2:34:54] through a prophet I want it to control
[2:34:55] my thinking control my actions I want to
[2:34:58] be I want to be anointed under the
[2:35:00] message of the hour I want it to be
[2:35:03] power under Supreme control that my
[2:35:06] dictates my my language my speaking my
[2:35:09] actions is all under the control of this
[2:35:13] message I want to be surrendered and
[2:35:15] sold out and have faith and this word is
[2:35:18] what I gives us our identification we
[2:35:20] can believe we're Sons and Daughters of
[2:35:21] God because the veil has been taken off
[2:35:23] the mystery is unveiled we're in the
[2:35:25] Harvest Time where he's separating the
[2:35:27] chap and the wheat he's separating the
[2:35:29] wheat and the tears and showing what the
[2:35:30] wheat is what are the sons of God those
[2:35:32] that can believe like Abraham believed
[2:35:34] and be imputed righteousness unto them
[2:35:37] because they believe the word for their
[2:35:38] day I believe that I believe I'm one of
[2:35:42] them and I believe if God ever tells me
[2:35:45] to speak squirrels into existence we can
[2:35:47] speak squirrels into existence why cuz I
[2:35:51] first have to believe that I'm a son or
[2:35:53] daughter of God I have to believe it's
[2:35:56] for me I have to believe that's my
[2:35:58] position I believe I have to believe
[2:36:00] that's what God wants to do in this day
[2:36:01] is Manifest himself through me if I can
[2:36:04] believe that and have that kind of Faith
[2:36:06] now all I have to do is wait for him to
[2:36:09] say and when he says it'll come to pass
[2:36:13] I believe this word of God and I want
[2:36:15] this word to be what controls my
[2:36:18] thinking
[2:36:19] my life let's all Stand

[2:36:48] us and mold us and to the image of Jesus
[2:36:50] Christ to bring us into a position a
[2:36:53] predestinated position so that we can
[2:36:55] have faith in God to come unto
