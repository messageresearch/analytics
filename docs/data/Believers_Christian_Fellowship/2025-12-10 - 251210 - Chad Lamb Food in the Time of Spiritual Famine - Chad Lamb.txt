Oh, you come inside. Fill up all my being ever to abide. I've opened all the windows. I've thrown wide every door. Oh, to come inside you, Lord. I need you more and more. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're once again so grateful to be gathered together. Lord, by your grace, Lord, in our lives, by your mercy, you've extended to us that you've drawn us together once more. And God, as we now turn our attention to your word, I pray that you would come on the scene, that you would take control of this gift that's in my life, Lord, and you would use me for your glory and break the bread of life to us and feed us from your abundance, Lord. May you give us the bread that we have need of, Lord, this evening. Strengthen us, Lord, by the word. Equip us, anoint us, inspire us, and send us forth, Lord, as bright lights in this world as as your representation here on earth. pray we go in strength because of the food that you feed us. We ask your blessing over all that's said and done this evening. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. It's certainly good to be together. If you could take your Bibles and turn with me to Amos. Let's start in the book of Amos. Amen. I just want to say how much I appreciate brother Josiah sing leading songs again tonight. I'm glad he started helping us out. It's nice to see the gift begin to manifest in different ones. We appreciate that. Amen. Amos 8 and verse 11. Amos chapter 8. We'll turn there. Give you just a minute. Amos 8 and 11. Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it. Amen. May God bless you all as you have your seats. May God bless us as we look at his word. Amen. May he give us eyes to see and ears to hear. Amen. Amen. Uh if we could pull up the PowerPoint, please. I want to go ahead and go right to my PowerPoint. I want to speak on food in the time of spiritual famine. Amen. And uh uh I ministered a little bit on this pretty much this topic, but I want to maybe take a few different points when I was down in Junction City. So, brother John and Sister Jill, sorry you have to hear it again. So, you know where to Amen, though. So, you're already ready. Amen. But, but I just wanted to share it. It was on my heart to share it. And some more things unfolded. Amen. So, I I want to I want to look at this food in the time of spiritual famine. Brother Venom showed us that we are in the time of spiritual famine. Amen. In the Leodysian age, there's apostasy. There's a blackout through the churches. Amen. There's an absolute famine in the land. Amen. But but he promised us food in the time of famine. &gt;&gt; So, we're so thankful for that. In Matthew 4:1, he says, "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was afterward hungered. And when the tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made bread." But he answered and said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." So what does man live by? The word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what we live by. Amen. Turn with me to John chapter 6. We're going to do some reading here in John 6. John chapter 6 and we'll begin at verse 30. All right. John 6 and verse 30. They said therefore unto him, "What sign showest thou then, that we may see and believe thee? What dust thou work? Our fathers did eat mana in the desert, as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat." Amen. If you just read previously in the chapter, Amen. Jesus had fed the 5000 by breaking the loaves and the fishes. and he had crossed the sea and many recognized he was gone and they followed him over and then they started asking for another miracle and he says you didn't follow me because you saw the miracle you follow me because you ate the bread &gt;&gt; and and you want to eat more bread. Amen. Is what he's telling them. Then then he tells them in verse 27, "Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the son of man shall give unto you, for him hath the father sealed." He says, "Quit seeking after temporary bread." Amen. He He by a miracle broke bread and broke fish and he fed 5,000 and they ate till they were full and then they gathered up the fragments thereof. But that meal had already wore off. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Quit seeking after and laboring for that meat which perisheth, but for the meat, amen, which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you." So then just a little bit later then they start asking him what work do you do and they're taunting him about more bread about mana from heaven about showing a sign and working a miracle and bread from heaven and verse 32 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, "Lord, ever more give us this bread." So stop there for a minute. He says, "What Moses gave you wasn't true bread." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they ate it. It was mana. It was true. They ate it. It sustained them in the journey. But it was a type. It was a foreshadow of another bread. Amen. And now he said, "The true bread of God is he &gt;&gt; which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world." Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger. He that believeth on me shall never thirst. So he says, now there's a true bread is he that came down to give life. And they say, oh, we we want that now. Give us that. And he says, I am that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am that. And they're expecting more of something to put into their mouth. &gt;&gt; They're looking for more of a miracle of a sign like they just had eaten from. and then talking about Moses and that was something they put into their mouth and now he's saying there's a true bread coming. Amen. Well, we want that bread and he says I am that bread and they're trying to figure out how do I put that in my mouth? &gt;&gt; Amen. They're stuck in carnality. Amen. And he's speaking spiritually. Let's go over to verse 48. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat mana in the wilderness and are dead. What's he saying to them? the miracle, the sign, the natural, the physical. Although it was a miracle and all it was from God and although it gave you natural life and sustained you in the journey, they're dead. &gt;&gt; So, you don't want THAT BREAD. YOU'VE GOT to have a different kind of bread. Not the bread that you eat and die, but the bread that you eat and live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This verse 50, this is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. All of a sudden, all of a sudden, they're all locked up now because they're looking for bread, mana, uh loaves, and fishes. They're looking for bread, something natural. And now he's telling them, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." Amen. You ate that bread and died, but you eat this bread and you'll live. I'm that bread and the bread that I give you is my flesh. And they're still thinking about something they put in their mouth. &gt;&gt; And then they get all confused and they get bothered and they get offended &gt;&gt; and they're wondering how that that we're going to eat his fle how are we going to take this bread? And he says I'm the bread and my flesh is the bread. And the question is what is his flesh? How is his flesh bread? He says the fle He says the bread that I'll give you is my flesh. Right? I'm going to read this again. The bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world. John 1:1 In the beginning was the word and the word was with God &gt;&gt; and the word was God. &gt;&gt; 14 and the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus says, "The the bread that I'm going to give you is my flesh." What is his flesh? His flesh is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His flesh is the word that has come into manifestation. The living word for the hour in which they live, the manifested promise of God. That's what his flesh was. His flesh was the word for the hour. His flesh was the promise for that day. His flesh was the word made manifest standing right in front of them. And I said, "This is what you HAVE TO EAT." HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKING THEIR mers and grinding down on his fingertips and his flesh and his senue. They're talking about receiving this manifestation, RECEIVING THE WORD MADE FLESH IN FRONT OF YOU. THAT'S HOW YOU EAT ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THE WORD HAS BEEN MADE FLESH AND I'M GIVING MY FLESH, THE WORD MADE FLESH FOR THE LIFE OF THE WHOLE WORLD. AND IF YOU EAT THIS BREAD, THE WORD, THE THOUGHT OF GOD COMING INTO MANIFESTATION, IF YOU EAT THAT BREAD, YOU'LL LIVE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. I want to eat that bread. &gt;&gt; I want to eat that bread. And and if if you could eat it that day, we can eat it this day. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 52. Now the Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed." Oh, I love this. And my blood is drink indeed. You know what he's saying? You can eat my flesh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you can drink my blood. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about material natural. He's talking about the word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You can receive it. You can eat it. You can receive it. You can partake of it. You can receive it into yourself. You can become one with it. He says, "My flesh is meat indeed." I want to read this again. Verse 55. and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me and I in him. &gt;&gt; As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever. I love these kind of dialogues that Jesus had because you can imagine for us, we've heard this all all the time that you've been in Christianity, you've heard this. But if you heard this for the very first time, being a Jew, Amen. And you were taught by the law of Moses that cannibalism was wrong and you're not even to take the blood of animals, how are you going to drink the blood of a man? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THEY'RE ALL TWISTED UP IN THEIR MIND. AND BUT they're not recognizing who's standing in front of him and what it is. This is the very word of God made material. God made flesh and before their eyes, it was the very word of God materialized before them. And he says, "If you receive my flesh, if you receive me and you you partake of me and you eat of me," listen, eating is a metaphor in the Bible. And that metaphor in the Bible is for receiving into yourself, for partaking of. Amen. Remember in Proverbs, uh I think it's Proverbs 30:20, it says, "Such is the way of an adulterous woman. She eateth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wipeth her mouth and say, "If I've done no evil." Amen. She wasn't eating. She was committing adultery. Amen. But that committing adultery was receiving something into herself. And the metaphor, it was typed with eating. Amen. So eating is receiving. Eating is partaking. Eating is consuming. Eating is bringing it into yourself. AMEN. BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and eating and humanity. God is always using these types of humanity to teach us spiritual lessons. Eating is how we sustain our life. You stop eating and you become weak. And after you eat, you don't eat for so long, you die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So eating pertains to life. Drinking pertains to life. THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, "COME and eat of me. EAT MY FLESH." AMEN. DRINK MY BLOOD. HE ALSO SAYS, "I'M A FOUNTAIN OF WATER. IF YOU DRINK FROM ME, OUT OF YOUR BELLY SHALL FLOW RIVER." I AM WATER. I AM I AM BREAD. HE that eats of me shall never hunger again. Shall never thirst again. BECAUSE WHAT? THE LIFE THAT I'LL GIVE THEM IS NOT A LIFE THAT RUNS OUT LIKE when you eat natural. But this is a life that you eat. It sustains forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's teaching us a lesson by eating his flesh and drinking his blood. And he says my flesh is meat indeed. If he says it's meat indeed, it's meat indeed. It's actually you're able to eat it &gt;&gt; spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we go over here to Matthew, I want to look at Matthew 16. Then Jesus said unto them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees." Levven is an ingredient that's used in bread that makes it rise. It makes the soft bread. and they they were confused and they begin to ask themselves why what he uh we forgot to bring bread. So he's he's he's chasening us because we forgot to bring bread in the boat on the journey. And Jesus begins to correct them and he says, "How is it that you do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread? I was talking about leaven. You only understand leaven as bread. I I'm giving you a type. &gt;&gt; How is it that you do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread that you should beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees? Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leavenven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. &gt;&gt; So when he said beware of leaven, he wasn't talking about the natural leaven that you bake into the bread. He was talking about a spiritual leaven that can get mixed into bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that spiritual leaven is what? Teaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what doctrine means. Teaching. Beware of the leaven, the teaching of the Pharisees that they mix into the word. And when they mix it into the word, it gets all puffed up and it looks good and and all of that, but there's sin baked into it because 11's a type of sin of unbelief. And so the Pharisees and Sadducees were mixing, amen, their own ideas in with the word of God. Amen. And creating what? A big religious system and a big old loaf. Amen. But he says, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beware of what they mix in their bread. He's not talking about anything you eat. This is spiritually what you consume, what you feed on, and what you receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God is good. Brother Bam says we are in our journey. We in our journey are something like Israel was. Israel in their journey had to get new mana every day. For new mana fell. We are supposed not to live in the light of Luther, live in the light of Wesley or live in the light of Pentecost. We're in another age. New mana. What happened if they tried to keep the mana over? It contaminated. It would kill them. That's the reason we got so many spiritual dead so-called Christians. They're eating a glare of another day. They're eating mana that's already contaminated. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bam, I'm still using this analogy of mana that's falling. Amen. As a type of something else. So, in the wilderness journey in the first Exodus, Amen. as they were journeying along, they had no provision. So, God provided them a daily portion of food. And that daily portion of food was mana. And it fell in the night. And they collected it in the morning. And it was it was supposed to be only enough to sustain them for that day. And and God told them not to gather more than what you'd need for one day. And he gave a portion for each man in the household. And they would gather for just each person in the household. And he told them not to keep it over. Amen. Because he was teaching them to trust him. I who fed you today, I will feed you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they didn't listen. This is what Moses tells them. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "It is mana, for they wish not what it was." Mana means, "What is it?" &gt;&gt; They had never seen it before. They didn't know what it was. What is it? And Moses said unto them, "This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat." It's amazing how many times people look at the word of God when you present the truth from the message to them the first time right out of the Bible, and they look at you and say, "What is that? &gt;&gt; I've never I've never heard that before. Nobody ever told me about water baptism in Jesus' name. I never heard such a thing as serpent saying. What do you mean God's only one? I only knew him as a trinity. What is that? This is the bread which God sent down from heaven. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD'S BREAD TO SUSTAIN US IN THE JOURNEY to give us strength to nourish us. Amen. And we look at it as what is it? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing how accurate the Bible is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says verse 16, "This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded. Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons. Take ye every man for them which are in his tents." So he says, "Only gather this much per person in your house, enough to eat for one day, and no more." But it says, "And Moses said, let not man leave of it till the morning." Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank, and Moses was wroth with them. the very thing that came from God to give them life for that day when they did not obey God and trust him for the new mana that would fall the next day but tried to hold on to the old mana which brother Benham says represents the previous age the former day and not trusting God to rain down bread food the word of God for this day fresh amen trying to hold on to the old Amen he said it bred worms and stank and Moses was wroth with them all All of a sudden, the thing that was wonderful one day, Amen, becomes a curse the next day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is remarkable. The one thing that gave life now becomes a stink. &gt;&gt; That is amazing to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one thing that was lifegiving now is contaminated. And brother Brim says, "And that that thing that's rotten mana that's got termites in it or wiggle tails or whatever you want to call it from 40, 50 years ago, still trying to eat that old mana that fell way back years ago." And the children of Israel on their journey, new mana fell every night. That's right. You couldn't keep it over. We don't live over some other age gone by. We're eating new mana, fresh mana out of heaven in our journey as we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God that God has given us fresh mana. That that this type of eating, this spiritual food that God's given us, he he's promised us that he was given us fresh mana. He has given us fresh mana. We don't have to go back to a previous age and eat that. That won't work like it did in the day that it fell. &gt;&gt; And the day that it fell, it was good. It was fresh. It was from the hand of God. It gave life and it moved us forward in the journey. But now we can't go back to that. We've got to take the part that's falling today. &gt;&gt; Hey, a amen. This whole concept of eating is so amazing. Amen. The analogy of eating, if you if you understand the spirit, the natural types, the spiritual. Amen. We are as strong as our diet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize there there I said this down in Junction City, too. There is an epidemic in our society of children suffering from malnutrition. &gt;&gt; But not because of lack of food, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're eating all the time. Some of them are overweight and undernourished. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the food doesn't have nutrients in it. It's highly processed. It's manufactured. Amen. It's only there to create a taste and an addiction. And they put more and more sugar in it to create more of addiction. And people are eating all the time and not getting stronger. Eating all the time and not getting healthier. Eating all the time and getting weaker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE NATURAL TYPES OF SPIRITUAL. THERE'S PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY, EVERY WEDNESDAY, AND THEY'RE NOT GAINING spiritual strength, but they're growing spiritually weaker and becoming more WORLDLY DAY BY DAY, MORE CONTAMINATED WITH MORE SICKNESSES and more illnesses. And America is one of the most sickest nations in all the world. because of our food. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because of our food. &gt;&gt; And a religious free society with a church on every corner is spiritually sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they're eating all the time, &gt;&gt; but there's no nutrition in the food. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's nothing that gives strength and life and health. Amen. But but there's increases of diabetes and all kinds of diseases and IT ALL ALMOST ALMOST ALL coming from diet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Almost all of it. Amen. To make it look good, taste good. Amen. Make it make it highly addictable and highly sought after, but it doesn't give life like real food that comes out of the ground and grown in your garden that you pluck with your own hands that has life in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's amazing that we we live in a society like that. So we can see the results the natural types of spiritual. Amen. And this whole metaphor of eating is a fascinating to me because when you go back to the book of Genesis, what caused the fall? Amen. In the analogy in the time, what caused the fall of all mankind? Eating. &gt;&gt; Don't partake of that tree. BUT SHE SAW, AMEN. She looked at THE TREE AND SAW it was good for food. Amen. A tree to uh make one wise, a desirable tree. AND SHE TOOK AND SHE ATE AND give to her husband and ate. This is THE ANALOGY. THEY PTOOK OF SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PURE WORD. They ptook of something that brought hybridization. They took of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which was a mixed tree. Amen. The tree of life WOULD HAVE ONLY BROUGHT LIFE, BUT THE tree of knowledge of good AND EVIL BROUGHT DEATH. And now in the analogy, WHAT THEY ATE CAUSED THEM TO DIE WHEN THEY could have ate something else and stayed alive. &gt;&gt; They could have eaten from the tree of life. Amen. Then they would they lost access to the tree of life. And it all had to do with eating. I love it. &gt;&gt; It's good to me. Amen. I want to look at this scripture in Jeremiah. Jeremiah 15:16. Thy words were found. Oh man, I'm going to black that out. Thy words were found. That means the words were lost. &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah says, "Thy words were found." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Do we have words that have been found that were lost in the dark ages? Lost through denomination, lost under Catholicism and darkness of denomination. Their words were found. But look what happens after the words were found. Thy words were found and I did eat them. And thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart. For I am called by thy name, oh Lord God of hosts. Hey, did you eat the word that's been found? &gt;&gt; Amen. And was it a joy and rejoicing of your heart? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. I feel like Jeremiah. I feel like I know exactly how he felt. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what was he eating? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 together. Turn with me there. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 10. Super familiar scripture to us, but I I want to take a few minutes and just look over it again. Ephesians 4:10. He that he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all that he might fill all things. And he gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. That's the building up of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. that we come into the stature of a perfect man. that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up unto him in all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying ing of itself and love. So Christ sent the gifts, these gifts down and he sent apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. And he sent them down to do what? He sent him down to complete the the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry, to build up the body of Christ, to bring us all into the stature of the fullness of Christ, to build the body up into the head which is Christ, and to bring the body up to every joint supplies for the building up or the edification of the body as a whole. So what were the five-fold ministry done? They were sent to help the body grow to full stature. &gt;&gt; That's right. How are they going to do it? What does it take? What do they do? Do they come down and drink coffee with you? Do they do they come down and tell you stories? NO. THEY GIVE THE WORD OF GOD. AND THE WORD OF GOD DOES ALL OF THIS. THE WORD OF GOD GROWS YOU INTO A STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. The word of God brings us into the unity of faith. THE WORD OF GOD KEEPS us from being deceived by the slide of men's hands and tossed by every wind OF DOCTRINE. THE WORD OF GOD BRINGS US INTO OUR position in the church. THE WORD OF GOD MAKES us a joint THAT SUPPLIES. THE WORD OF GOD BRINGS US TO A PLACE WHERE THE WHOLE BODY IS EDIFIED TOGETHER in itself in love. Amen. How does the five-fold MINISTRY DO THIS? NOT WITH THEIR PERSONALITIES, NOT WITH THEIR CHARISMA, NOT WITH THEIR OWN INTELLECTUAL WISDOM, NOT BY GOING OUT TO BALL GAMES WITH YOU, NOT BY COMING to your HOUSE AND DRINKING COFFEE. HOW DOES THIS ACCOMPLISHED BY these ministry gifts? Because these are five different functions of the ministry of Christ. That is to take the word and dish THE WORD BACK OUT TO THE PEOPLE. AND IT'S THE WORD THAT brings us into THIS POSITION. IT'S THE WORD THAT BUILDS US UP. IT'S THE WORD THAT strengthens us and brings us into life and grows us and MATURES US. JUST LIKE THE FOOD DOES IN OUR natural life, this word does to our spiritual life. &gt;&gt; So, how does the ministry do this? HOW DOES THE FIVE MINISTRY ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THAT? BECAUSE, AMEN. these are the five gifts that God anointed to break down his word and preach the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's the word that does this. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say we eat it. &gt;&gt; Do you know how happy I am that when God told me you have to feed sheep because the name the word pastor means feeder of sheep? Listen, you know how horrible it is for a mom try to keep fixing supper and she's got no ingredients. There's nothing in the pantry, no tools to work with. But oh, praise God. We live in an age the kitchen's equipped. &gt;&gt; You need a blender, you got a blender. Amen. You need ice maker. You got an ice maker. You need you what whatever contraption you can think of, you got it. Amen. There there's automatic grinders and there's this that and every tool we need of has been placed in our hands in this day in the hands of the ministry like never before. And the pantry IS FULL OF ALL THE ingredients that you could ever need. AMEN. IT'S GOT ALL THE organic original non-hybrid ingredients. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT BRING HEALTH AND STRENGTH AND LIFE. AMEN. TO THE BODY OF CHRIST AND the fridge is full and the pantry is full. Amen. AND ALL THE TOOLS ARE SET OUT IN THE KITCHEN. I think it's amazing. Sometimes we'll be planning to have company over and and we we we set a date and people are coming or we've got guests that are ministering guests that are coming in and and and and my wife keeps asking me, "What do you think we should have?" I don't know what we should have. You you're the expert, you know. And we'll give out ideas and she'll she'll say something to me. She says, "I'm just not feeling it. I have to catch an inspiration. &gt;&gt; I'm like, my goodness, I'm always inspired to eat whatever's on the table, but cooking must be different. Amen. Amen. And she'll wait and wait and wait, and all of a sudden, she'll catch an inspiration. As soon as she does, she's all day in the kitchen. She's love it. She's having a wonderful time. She's in her element cuz she caught the inspiration of what to fix for the guests that are coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what preaching is like. &gt;&gt; Exactly. To the tea. Amen. You sit around all day. You got a kitchen that's fully equipped. You got a pantry that's full. AMEN. BUT YOU'RE NOT JUST IN there putting ingredients together and stirring up for nothing. YOU'VE GOT TO CATCH AN inspiration first. But if I get an inspiration for stir fry, it's there. If I got an inspiration for curry chicken, it's there. If I HAVE AN INSPIRATION FOR POT ROAST, IT'S ALL THERE. WHATEVER THE HOLY GHOST INSPIRES, WE GOT THE INGREDIENTS. WE GOT THE EQUIPMENT. WE GOT THE KITCHEN. WE CAN EAT GOOD. FRIENDS, YOU KNOW HOW EXCITING IT IS TO BE PART OF THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY TODAY? Praise God. I'm so excited. Can you imagine walking into a first class commercial kitchen with everything you need and then all the food and EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER dream of. &gt;&gt; Oh man, for you sisters who like to cook. I'm sure that's fun for me. I wouldn't know what to do with half of it. I'd be over there eating raw vegetables. &gt;&gt; But praise God, it's so good to live in this day &gt;&gt; when God has given us everything we have need of. In 1 Thessalonians 3, the Apostle Paul says, "Night and day, praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith." This struck me as odd when I read this. We might perfect that which is lacking in your faith. He's talking to the Thessalonians. The Thessalonians had already received Christ as the Messiah. They had already believed in the atonement by his substitutionary death. They believed in his resurrection. They were born again. They had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But yet they were lacking. &gt;&gt; That means they could grow more. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW WAS HE GOING TO grow them? What was he going to do? He's saying uh night and day praying exceeding that I might see your FACE AND MIGHT PERFECT THAT WHICH IS lacking in your faith. How was he going to perfect that which was lacking in their faith? How was he going to help their faith grow? Probably by sitting and drinking coffee with them and telling them stories and talking about ball games and no, HE WAS GOING TO BRING TO THEM THE mystery of the gospel that he had in him. And he was going to further unfold the word. And the further unfolding of the word IS GOING TO PERFECT THAT WHICH WAS LACKING IN THEIR FAITH. That means even though they believed IN CHRIST, THEY BELIEVED IN THE RE THE the substitutionary death, the resurrection, they were saved and filled with the Holy Ghost, THEY WERE STILL GROWING IN FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And in ORDER TO GROW MORE IN FAITH, THEY NEEDED PAUL TO COME AND PREACH THE WORD BECAUSE THE PREACHING OF THE WORD WAS HELPING them grow in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. HOW WILL HE PERFECT WHICH IS LACKING IN THEIR FAITH? BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; Let's go to second Peter 3 together. Just want to hit a couple of these spots. Second Peter 3. Second Peter 3 and verse 15. and accounting that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you. As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood. I love that they didn't always understand Paul. &gt;&gt; So, I'm okay if I don't always understand what Brother Bam's trying to get me to see. Amen. They didn't always understand Paul. But just because Paul was hard to be understood doesn't mean Paul was wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be simple to be true. &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be simplistic. It can be hard to be understood. &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, &gt;&gt; some things are hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest. That means twist as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware, lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen. But Peter's admonishing to grow. You can grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. How are you going to do that? By the word. By what we eat. How will we grow? by what we eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the way we grow will determine what our diet is. &gt;&gt; Amen. First Peter 2:2, "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." So how do you grow? By the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're newborn babes, you take the milk of the word that you may grow. Praise God. Amen. But you're not always supposed to be a newborn babe. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul says in Hebrews, called of God, he's speaking about uh Melkisedc, called of God, uh a high priest after the order Melzdc, of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing. For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat. What's he speaking of in milk and strong meat? He's wanting to preach about Melkisedc. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he said, I can't preach to you about Melkisedc because you're dull of hearing because you should be more advanced than you are. I can't get into the doctrine of Melkisedc because you're now on milk. If you were on meat, you could understand the doctrine OF MELKISEDC. WELL, PAUL COULDN'T go into Melkisedc. But guess who could? Guess who could give us a background? GUESS WHO COULD PREACH who is this Melkisedc? Amen. It was the PROPHET OF THE AGE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T READY for it then. But when we come to the end OF THE AGES, AMEN. NOW we're eating meat. We're maturing. WE'RE GROWING. AND NOW THERE'S A PROPHET ON THE SCENE THAT can take US TO THE PLACE THAT PAUL COULDN'T TAKE THEM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T READY. &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE WORD AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT GROWING. AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT MATURITY ALL BASED OFF WHAT they were eating. &gt;&gt; For everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness. See that &gt;&gt; you can't go to the meat of the word. Amen. Until you become skillful in the word. &gt;&gt; You've got to grow up. &gt;&gt; For he is a babe. But strong meat belongth to them that are of full age. Even those who by reason by reason of uh use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. Amen. What is it that's going to bring us to the meat? Amen. When we learn the lessons when we grow when we grow to where we can take the meat because the meat is for those that are full age. And this message is full of meat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the God of this evil age. He says, "Brother, has God give you a spirit of the world till you can't see what's wrong?" This is little G. He's talking about the message is the God of this evil age. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Has this God give you the spirit of the world till you can't see that that's wrong? Has he blinded your eyes to the ethics of the church, the denomination, the creed, and so forth that you can't see that God is vindicating his word and making it so? Has your job? Has your boss, has your wife, has your children, has your church or anything separated you from the word of God, which is the only source of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the only source of life? The word of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is the bread of life? The word of God. Jesus Christ. I am the bread that came down of heaven. I am the bread of life. And if you eat my flesh, which is the word made flesh, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; then you're part of me. Now and seed is not air. He says, "Neither shall a Christian eat on the dead carryins from old denominational doctrines and things. They want the word of God fresh, the promise of the hour." God promised rabbits in the days of Luther. He promised other things in days of others. But now he promised us a full square meal, the full seven course menu for all seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. to those who can eat it, those who can h receive it, those who can partake of it. Amen. And I want to eat the seven course menu. &gt;&gt; And if God has set a seven course menu, a seven course meal, he did it for our strength so that we could overcome in this day. And I don't want to leave any part out. &gt;&gt; So the food is available. And Joel says, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, the palmer, my great army which I sent among you." Brother Ram goes to this message here and he starts to show you the restoration of the bride tree and that God is bringing us out of the church ages by a restoration and what that those four stages of that insect ate down to the dark ages. God has been restoring through the reformation to bring back. Amen. the original church, the original planting. &gt;&gt; And he says, "My great army which I send among you, and ye shall eat in plenty." &gt;&gt; When will we eat in plenty? When they restore, when he says, "I will restore all the years." When did he restore? It's in THIS MESSAGE HE RESTORES. SO IN THIS MESSAGE, we can eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS IT WAS A PORTION. IT WAS A MEASURE. IT WAS A TRICKLING BACK, BRINGING BACK BY PORTIONS. AMEN. BUT THIS ISN'T THE PORTION. THIS IS THE SEVENTH COURSE MENU. THE MEAL IS SET. AMEN. THE THE THE supernatural spiritual feast OF THE LORD IS LAID OPEN. COME AND DINE. &gt;&gt; Ye shall EAT IN PLENTY AND BE SATISFIED. And praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HUNGRY ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT LETHARGIC ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT IN FAMINE ANYMORE BECAUSE WE FOUND THE MASTER'S TABLE. WE'VE BEEN INVITED to the feast. &gt;&gt; And you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. How many's eaten good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it feels good and it tastes good and it's giving us spiritual strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother goes on to say, 'I went back in this vision and there was a little long building and then a voice said to me, and all of you remember this or many of you, a voice said to me, bring in food, store it in. That's the only way to keep them here is give them food. And I brought in had brought in great big barrels full of the prettiest carrots and the prettiest vegetables and the things I ever seen. I mean, this is the time brother Ben was supposed to go overseas in a trip and he has the vision about the two brothers in the canoe, brother Wood and Brother Soffman going as tourists, but he was in a little white canoe going up and down the bank and he said, "It's fine to go and anywhere on the east coast, anywhere in the United States for one meeting, but not across the ocean to Europe." Amen. And so this vision is all God gives him the interpretation. But after the vision, he sees this long building which was Brandham Tabernacle. And he and he sees it where they're bringing in all these barrels full of the greatest, prettiest vegetables he ever did see. And God tells him, "Stay home." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't go overseas. Stay home and store up the food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What food? &gt;&gt; It's the food we're eating on now. &gt;&gt; HE WAS TOLD, "DON'T TAKE THAT TRIP. DON'T GO OVERSEAS. YOU STAY HOME. AND THAT WAS AT the in the MIDDLE PART OF 62 AND ALL THROUGH THE END OF 62 was the transition that brings us to 63 to sers. Is this the time? Amen. TO GOING OUT WEST TO GETTING THE opening of the seals. Amen. The coming back and preaching the opening OF THE SEALS. ALL TAKES PLACE AFTER HE'S TOLD STAY HOME and store up the food. &gt;&gt; Amen. And look what he was storing up. &gt;&gt; Hamburgers and hot dogs and ho Hos and Cheerios. No. Amen. The prettiest carrots. THE PRETTIEST WHAT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY FOOD. STUFF THAT BRINGS HEALTH AND NUTRITION AND LIFE AND VITALITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Christ is the mystery. I want you to note this is Christ the mystery of God revealed. Said, "Bless our dear beloved pastor, the shepherd. We pray that you'll anoint him with the Holy Spirit of thy word and reveal to them and feed the flock." It was just a while ago when you showed the vision, the little tabernacle here about to store up the food. And there would come a time when this would be needed. &gt;&gt; There would come a time when this would be needed. &gt;&gt; I live in the time when I need this food. &gt;&gt; When we see brother Sman and brother Woods ready to cross over into another country, but you said, "Store up this food here for the time." Lord, reverently I've tried to do that. And now this morning in this lesson that we have thought of, I pray that you will cap it all off, Lord, to show that you're God and this is your word and your truth. Grant it, Lord, that the people might feed thereon and grow fat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As it was in the grace of God, and they would see that it's God's great mercy to us in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother Brenham says grow fat, he means healthy. &gt;&gt; That's an old term for healthy. &gt;&gt; It used to be a compliment to call people fat. &gt;&gt; I don't feel complimented with that. &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Benham talked about uh Florence Nightingale and the picture where she was emaciated? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And they put a little black mark across her because she was nude and and and she was just bones. He said just like skin stretched over bones. He said, "I just met her other day. She's healthy and fat and doing well." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what Brother Bram said. He's using old terminology. Amen. So, what's he saying? Amen. May the people eat this and grow healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Little later on the same message helped this morning. Lord, as we read the word, may the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the saints to hold them. And may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food, fine, healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle, may we today receive a whole barrel full of that. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Or a tape load. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength, the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead. Amen. What was all these vegetables stored up for? So that we could grow fat and healthy and have strength for the journey that lay for the task that lays ahead. &gt;&gt; He said, "And give us a whole barrel full of that or a tape load." Hey, listen. When you go and you start a new message, you just cracked open another barrel of the finest looking vegetables you ever seen. healthy food that will give you life, STRENGTH, VITALITY, AND ALL you need to grow into the full stature that Christ has for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that it might reveal Christ in the hour that we live in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; And we can eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it the word made flesh again? &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do with it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Same thing we were supposed to do with it 2,000 years ago. Eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the word made flesh in our day. When it was the word made flesh, he said, "My flesh is meat indeed. Eat it. Drink it." Now the word has been made flesh again. What are we supposed to do with it? Eat it. Drink it. Have life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10. I'm not going to read all this, but we know Revelation 10 so well. There's a little book open. Amen. And the voice says, "Go to the angel with the book open." Amen. And take the book. And he goes to the angel and he says, "Give me the book." And he and and he said unto me, "Take it and eat it up." &gt;&gt; What are you supposed to do with this open book? Eat it up. &gt;&gt; What is this open book? It's the book of life. &gt;&gt; It's the title deed. IT'S THE BOOK OF LIFE. IT'S THE LAMB'S book of life. Amen. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL THE SAME THING. AND WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT? Eat it. Amen. And when you eat it, IT'LL BRING LIFE INTO YOU. IT'LL BRING YOU INTO HIM AND HIM INTO YOU. AND IT'LL GIVE YOU ENOUGH LIFE INSIDE OF YOU AND GROW YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PROPHESY AGAIN. AND THEN YOU CAN GO ALL OVER AND EVERYWHERE sharing the word. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, AMEN. THERE WAS A TREE that they weren't supposed to eat of, BUT THEY ATE THAT MIXED TREE AND BROUGHT DEATH. AND SO THEY WERE KEPT AWAY from the tree of life. OH, BUT ALL THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES and the restoration, he's been trying TO DRIVE THEM BACK TO THE tree of life because the way was made open again by the death at Calvary. And he's been trying to bring us back. AND AT THE end of the ages, at the close of time, amen, there's been a prophet on the scene. And Christ HAS COME DOWN WITH WHAT? THE VERY THING THAT THEY were separated with in the GARDEN HAS COME BACK INTO THEIR HANDS. THE TITLE DEED, THE BOOK OF LIFE. AMEN. THE BREAD OF LIFE, THE TREE OF LIFE. And we got access to it all again. And what is he asking US TO DO? HE'S ASKING us to eat it. Amen. In the beginning, we ate and died, BUT NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT AND LIVE. &gt;&gt; We got to receive the word, receive it into ourselves, and may it be our life. And the anointed ones at the end time, the prophet says this. He said, 'I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river. I was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these things and fortells these things that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only one that's near when he does it. I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It wasn't It was It's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel, his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of man is Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on? It's the son of man. Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man, a man, his words will fail, but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're back again where the word is made flesh. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "My body, my flesh is the bread of life. &gt;&gt; It is meat indeed. And if you eat it, you'll live." And now we've had the son of man on earth again &gt;&gt; manifesting himself once again. &gt;&gt; And you're not feeding on the words of a man. This isn't William Brandham's words. You're not feeding on the words of a man. Those words would fail. You're feeding on the unfailing body. What's the body? What's the body? It's the word made flesh again. It's the manifestation of the son of man. A son of man revealing the son of man. the manifestation of the son of man in flesh again. And we're feeding on the body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; What Jesus INVITED THEM TO DO SO long ago and commanded them to do, we have the option to do today to eat him and live. He is THE BREAD OF LIFE. He is the tree of life. He is the fountain of living waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's asked us to eat. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask us to work. He didn't ask us to labor. He didn't ask us to plan. He didn't ask us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All he asked us to do was eat. &gt;&gt; Remember the parable of the great man who had a feast and and when he created this great feast, not the not the scripture where they man created a feast, a wedding for his son, but just where the man created the feast. And he sent out his service to bid them to the feast. Amen. And none of them wanted to come. Amen. They had excuses because of this and because of that, I can't come. Amen. And he was wroth. He was angry and he said, "Send them back. Send the servant back out. GO BACK OUT AND COMPEL those that came in." And they did. They went out and they compelled them and many came. And then he goes back to the master. The servant goes back to the master and said, "Lord, we've done what you said, but there's still room." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go to the highways and go TO THE BYWAYS AND TO the hedges." And compelled them to come in because my supper shall BE FULL. AMEN. I didn't make it in vain. I made it to be eaten. And I made it to be consumed. I made it to be enjoyed. Amen. And I'm SO GLAD THAT GOD SENT SOMEBODY TO THE highways and the hedges and the byways CUZ HE PLUCKED ME OUT AND HE BROUGHT ME TO THE SPIRITUAL feast that's been prepared at the end time. Amen. Because his supper IS GOING TO BE FULL because the food is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we're feasting on that good word. Amen. And in the God of this evil age, Brother Brim said in this, he says, "Father, as I have said many times, the sun rises in the morning. And as it comes up across the earth, it's sent by God to ripen the grain to make natural food for natural living. But oh God, you said to them that fear his name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings. Let the son of righteousness, the word of God, rise in the hearts of the people, and the healing rays of faith in that word cure every disobedient to the word and bring them to the fullness of sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember where this scripture is? To them that fear his name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings. Extra credit. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. But let's go read it out of Malachi 4. For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble. And the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayeth the Lord of hosts, that I shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall. In that day that the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings. Have we seen that day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the day you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall, and you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet. And the day that I shall do this, sayith the Lord of hosts, remember you the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. That's this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this day, he said, "Those that fear my name shall the son of righteous arise with healing in his wings." Have we seen that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In that day, you shall grow up as calves of the stall. What's a calf of the stall? Amen. That that's that is a beef cow. Amen. That's not sent out to pastor. He doesn't have to go find his own food. Amen. that he's put in the barn and he's put in a staunch and every day somebody throws some more food in front of him and all he has to do is stay in the stall. He doesn't have to hunt. He doesn't have to work. He doesn't have to labor. He doesn't have to do anything. All he has to do is stand there and when the farmer throws a new load, all he's got to do is eat the new load of grain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this day that the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings. You're going to grow UP AS A CALF OF THE STALL BECAUSE HE SET A SEVEN COURSE MEAL and he keeps dumping ON YOU EVERY DAY. There's more word and more word and more word. And we don't have to be like those in Amos's DAY WHERE THERE'S A FAMINE NOT OF FOOD AND DRINK BUT of hearing the word of God. And they shall run from the east to the NORTH TO THE SOUTH AND HUNT FOR THE WORD OF GOD AND THEY WON'T FIND IT. AMEN. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO HUNT. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS STAND STILL AND EAT WHAT HE'S POURED OUT UPON US. WHAT HE'S GIVEN TO US, WHAT THE GREAT husbandman and shepherd has provided for his sheep. AND HE'S ONLY ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; STAND STILL AND EAT. &gt;&gt; DON'T RUN AROUND. DON'T GO CRAZY. AMEN. DON'T TRY TO FIX ANYTHING. DON'T GO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN. JUST STAND STILL AND EAT WHAT I'VE GIVEN YOU. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL GROW FAT AND HEALTHY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Listen friends, ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS CRACK open another barrel. When you wake up IN THE MORNING, CRACK up another barrel of that food that's been stored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there'll be a time it's needed. Now's the time it's needed. &gt;&gt; What is that word of God going to do? Grow us into the stature &gt;&gt; of the image of Christ. to grow us into the head and all things which is Christ to make us a joint that fits into the body that supplies for the needs of the everything we have need of is going to be accomplished by this word that we're eating on. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need us to run all over and come up with our own food, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He gave us a seven course menu &gt;&gt; and he said, "Come and dine." The master calleth, &gt;&gt; "Come and dine." &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't put us in a works program to accomplish a bunch of things. It'll all be accomplished by the diet that we eat. &gt;&gt; And the diet we eat, listen, it's already genetically in your soul to be whatever he wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All you need is good spiritual nutrition to meet your genetic potential. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's all you need. &gt;&gt; The genetic potential is already placed there from before the foundation of the world. All it needs is to grow and all it needs is nutrition. Amen. Vitamins, minerals, nutrition, calories so that it can grow to its full potential. What is it you and I need? We need to re we need to realize who we are and what God has given us. And we need to hold still and eat this message and keep eating this message and keep going to the storehouse and keep cracking it open and becoming what we were always meant to become by feeding on the best food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's available. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things we can eat spiritually and we can feed our minds. Amen. But those are the those are Twinkies and Hostess cakes and all the things that's killing us spiritually. AMEN. BUT GOD GAVE US something that'll give us life and sustain us and grow us. &gt;&gt; What do we need to do? Eat it. &gt;&gt; What were they supposed to do with the open book? Read the Bible and tell me what you're supposed to do with the open book. &gt;&gt; Eat it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And after you eat it, you prophesy again. It'll bring you into what you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for a seven course menu. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I was invited to the feast. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful somebody was shaking the bushes and found me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And said, "You want to come and eat?" And I happened to be hungrier than I thought I was. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I thought I was fine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I thought I had good food. Didn't realize I was malnourished. I didn't realize I was spiritually anemic. I didn't realize I was dying and I was riddled with all kinds of spiritual diseases. Amen. But when I saw the banquet set and I began to taste the food, it was the best tasting thing I ever put in my mouth. And I kept eating it, it kept changing me and changing me and changing me. And guess what, friends? The more healthy food you eat, the more healthy food you want to eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. The more junk food you eat, the more junk food you want to eat. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, this isn't rocket science. We've all figured this out at this point. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we have the privilege of having ministers in our home from all over the world. Amen. And they come from Europe and Africa and India, and we've had them from all over the world. Amen. And those of a western culture, Western society, those in Europe and and Australia and all that, they can they can eat what we eat and then go right along with it. But you know those who are used to eating nutritious, healthy, organic food, those from northern India and those folks from Africa, they don't like our food at all. &gt;&gt; And they can't wait to go home and get their food. They're so used to eating real food. They they don't like something that you open a package and pull out tastes horrible to them. &gt;&gt; They don't like it. You try to give them a treat, something, and you and you peel open a package and you pull it out. The first time they taste it, it doesn't taste good to them. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they eat real food. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to eat so much real food that the world's entertainment doesn't taste good to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to eat healthy vegetables. I want to eat the prettiest carrots and the healthiest vegetables you've ever seen until I lose a desire to taste of the world. Amen. We can make we can make some kind of uh uh commitments and New Year's resolutions and we're not going to go to media and we're going to we're going to do this. We're going to take a timeout and I'm not I'm only going to limit myself TO 5 MINUTES A DAY. LISTEN, THAT'S NOT GOING to work because the more you eat it, the more you want it. The more bad food, more fast food, more processed, the more you want. And you start to crave it. And the more media you partake of and the more entertainment you entertain your your spirit with, the more it wants. But you just come back to this feast and start eating the organic, non-hybrid, original food, and you start to lose the taste for everything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I went off sugar for a little while. I I I backslid. I I have to admit, but when I went off for a couple months, &gt;&gt; the next time I ate a dessert, it tasted bitter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was so sweet. It was bitter. That's how much my taste adjusted. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh God, adjust my spiritual taste to where the only thing that tastes good is what's real, what's original, what's the original seed, the original grain." You know, they got all these heirloom grains now. They're trying to go back to the before it was hybridized, before it was uh genetically modified. We go to heirloom. Hey, listen. I got heirloom grain. Amen. It's been brought back. Amen. the original faith of the fathers, the original teaching of the apostles. We've got the heirloom grain, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We got the non-leaven bread. We've been given everything we need. Let's just eat it, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eat it and enjoy it and keep eating it until it's the only thing that we want to eat. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. How many of you happy you got a seven course menu? &gt;&gt; How many are encouraged to keep eating? Amen. &gt;&gt; Wake up in the morning, I can check the news or eat good food. I'm going to eat good food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not not evil to check the news, but you know, four four hours of news. &gt;&gt; Is bad news. &gt;&gt; But four hours of the message isn't going to hurt you a bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful that God's called me to be a calf of the stall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a wandering, aimless, needy, starving. Hey, listen. Remember remember uh Pharaoh's dream when Joseph was in captivity and Pharaoh had a dream that none of the wise men could tell him and he saw seven fat kind cows. &gt;&gt; Seven fat and healthy. Fat was the word for healthy. &gt;&gt; And and and then coming up out of the river was was seven spindly. Amen. Weak. Amen. uh uh uh uh uh emaciated cattle and the seven emaciated cattle ate the fat cattle and he he wanted an interpretation for the dream and didn't have it. But but then Joseph come along and Joseph said, "This is the interpretation. You're going to have seven good years of harvest where you got good food and have plenty." That's what the seven fat kind represented. But then you're going to have seven years of famine. And the seven years of famine are going to eat up the seven good years because all those skinny cows ate the fat cows. And after they ate the fat cows, they were just as skinny as ever, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It didn't help them any &gt;&gt; and everything would be lost. But what was his advice? His advice was store up the grain in the good years. Amen. To sustain you through the bad years. Amen. That's what God told Brother Brandham to do. Store up these vegetables. You're going to need it in the future. Amen. Our Joseph is Christ. Amen. And he's the one who controls the grain. And now in that day when you go to get grain, you had to go to Joseph. And Joseph is Christ. And Joseph is sitting on the grainery and he's GOT ALL THE GRAIN, AMEN, OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES, ALL THE ORIGINAL teaching of the seven thunders. And he's READY TO DISH IT OUT TO WHOEVER will come to him to receive it. &gt;&gt; And remember his brethren tried TO COME AND BUY IT. AMEN. HE WOULD SELL IT TO EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT EVERY TIME HIS BRETHREN TRIED TO BUY IT, HE PUT THEIR MONEY back in their sack. HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. THIS IS FREE FOR YOU. And then he says, YOU COME DOWN TO GOAN. I'M GOING TO FEED YOU. I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN YOU. I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY. OH, PRAISE GOD. JOSEPH HAS BROUGHT US IN GOAN and he has the storehouse and he's sustaining us. He's keeping us. He's feeding us out of the grainery. &gt;&gt; Just eat and live, my friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. eat and have life and strength and vitality and be all that we're supposed to be by eating the message. All our efforts are going to fail. All of our attempts, all of our trying, it'll come to not. But if we just keep eating the word, the word will produce its own life. It'll bring it'll bring life out of the seed that's in the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep eating, receiving, and it'll become all it was meant to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you can come, please, brother Josiah, if you could come. Let's just bow our heads and thank God. Oh Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful for a seven course menu. A table that is spread with everything healthy that we need to become fully developed. God, there's been no other age that's had this table set. There's been no other age that's had the seven course meal. We couldn't come to it till the end of the seven church ages when you peeled back the veil. You opened the seals and you laid the table out with a seven course meal and a seven course menu. And God, help us to take advantage of the day we live in. God, for many wise men and many noble men and many prophets long to see this day, but God, here we are. How many prophets, how many of those in the church ages, how many of those mighty men that only had a portion of light and gave their life for it? How many of them would love to belly up to the table we eat at every day? God, help us not take it for granted, but to love it, to enjoy it, to feast at it, and to be calves of the stall. Help us, Lord, to stop running around and wasting time and wasting energy, but help us to stand still in the place where you've placed us and feed to receive the portion that you're portioning out in this day. And may it bring us into full development and full health. We love you, Lord, and we thank you for all you've given to us. God, how could we ever thank you enough for the day and hour we live in, for eyes to see and ears to hear, and for an appetite that you give us to eat your word. God, how thankful I am that there's so many barrelfuls of good food that are available to me. God, tomorrow morning I can turn on a message and crack open a barrel load, a tape load of good, healthy food. God, I'm so thankful. Help us, Lord, to feed and help us to rest and help us to trust. And God, may you bring us to the place you've ordained us to be by the diet that you're feeding us. We love you. We ask your blessings over this as we go our way. May you help us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all, brother. Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his chosen people come and die.
