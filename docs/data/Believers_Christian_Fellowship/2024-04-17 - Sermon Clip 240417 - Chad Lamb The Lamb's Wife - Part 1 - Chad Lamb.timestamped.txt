[0:04] be my wedded husband to have to hold
[0:07] from this day forward man that sounds so
[0:09] good I take you to be my husband to have
[0:12] him to hold from this day
[0:13] forward for better for
[0:17] worse for richer for
[0:20] poorer in sickness and in health to love
[0:26] and to cherish till death do us part

[0:31] thereto I give thee my pledge what we do
[0:35] when we come to this marriage vow is we
[0:37] pledge to one another I'm not just here
[0:39] for the good
[0:41] times I'm not just here for the
[0:43] blessings and I'm not just here when it
[0:45] goes right but I pledge myself to you

[1:05] not running away because I've pledged
[1:07] myself to
[1:09] him oh praise be to God how should we
[1:12] pledge ourselves to Christ amen only for
[1:15] richer only for better only for the
[1:17] benefits or are we here in the good
[1:19] times and the low
[1:22] times you know Christ didn't come to
[1:24] Earth just for the highlights amen he
[1:26] came down to be spit upon he came down
[1:29] to be rejected he came down to be mocked
[1:31] and why did he do it he did it for me he
[1:33] sacrificed for me and if the lamb
[1:35] sacrificed for me his wife the Lamb's
[1:37] wife ought to reflect his image right
[1:40] back to
[1:42] him oh praise God God help us Amen to
[1:45] come to the realization and the reality
[1:47] of this because I don't want to be a
[1:49] fairweather Christian I want to be the
[1:51] real deal amen if I pass through poverty
[1:54] with my Lord you say how could he he
[1:56] owns the cattle in the Thousand Hills
[1:57] but sometimes he's got to bring us down
[1:59] down into the valley Amen to move
[2:02] somewhere else and it comes down to a a
[2:04] a time of without a time of lacking a
[2:07] time of suffering amen and can I walk
[2:09] with him in a time of suffering the same
[2:11] I can walk with him in a time of
[2:13] blessing can I trust him the same can I
[2:16] stay submissive to his word the same or
[2:18] am I going to start getting discouraged
[2:20] and quit coming to church amen and start
[2:22] doing other things amen because why well
[2:24] I'm just so down because times are so
[2:26] tough and things are going wrong and
[2:28] nothing goes right for me and I got
[2:29] discouraged and I quit coming to church
[2:31] why did you give up on Christ he never
[2:33] gave up on you what about your pledge to
[2:36] be a wife and stop being a girlfriend
[2:39] and be a wife
[2:40] amen when times are tough don't leave
[2:43] your husband when times are good don't
[2:45] leave your husband in sickness and in
[2:48] health but I'm sick and he didn't heal
[2:49] me and I got discouraged and I quit
[2:51] coming why did you give up on him is is
[2:54] his word that tells you to come to the
[2:56] congregation to the fellowship amen why
[2:59] dishonor him just because of a poor time
[3:03] or a sick
[3:04] time or a worse
[3:10] time does he not know how he's
[3:13] leading can we not trust him in All
