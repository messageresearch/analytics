just give you an update i had heard that brother everett c was not doing very well he was in very poor health and i just spoke with brother paul just a few minutes ago to get an update and he said brother everett's in the hospital and he had caught an infection a little bit ago and he started declining really really fast with that infection but as many of you know brother everett was diagnosed with dementia some time ago and started declining and after this infection and stay in the hospital they noticed a very very rapid decline and in fact i believe they've called hospice and is that correct brother and so they're not expecting him to make it and so as an assembly i'd just like to pray because our brother's been suffering amen and i hate to see anybody suffer it's it's we're going to ask god to either raise our brother up or take him home amen because what's the long what waits for our brother on the other side is far better than anything that he could ever see again on this side but if god still has a purpose for our brother in this life we're going to ask to raise him up quickly for his sake and his family's sake and if not to let him go on to his reward quickly as well not to linger in between so let's just bow our heads and pray together as an assembly lord jesus we thank you for the privileged lord you've given us of being together again tonight and god our hearts are grieving for our brother everett lord as he is in this declining state and a weakened body that is failing because of the curse but god you have paid the price to reverse the curse lord and in you every promise is available lord and we're just asking god that you would come on the scene and that you would move in one way or the other for our brother god if there's a purpose for our brother i pray that you'd raise him up lord god if there's something more for him to do i'd pray that you would rapidly turn the situation around and restore him nor not just to health but restore his mind all those also to health my god if our brother has served his purpose on this life we pray that you'd allow him to go on to his reward and to his rest may he gather with the saints on the other side and rejoice in that place that your prophet tried to describe to us lord and while we're just praying that you would touch the family give them strength give them courage be a very present help in the time of trouble to them comfort them lord comfort his wife and his children lord and i pray that you give them wisdom if they have to make any kind of decisions that your presence lord would lead and guide them every step and god we love you and we love our brother and we thankful lord for his life and we just pray that you would do what's best for him in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you well we're standing if we could turn to the book of colossians we'll begin reading from colossians chapter 1. so god bless you brother keith sister lee it's good to see you guys back we knew you were coming back to help sister nancy but it's good to see you here and god bless you for that amen let's look in colossians chapter 1 verse 3. and we're going to continue on in the same subject so if we can pull up that first powerpoint well this is going to be from faith to love part two and we're going to begin reading in colossians chapter 1 verse 3. we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which you have to all saints i think this is a wonderful scripture he's commending them for their faith which is the foundation faith you have in jesus christ and the love do you have for saints which is brotherly love all the way at the top next to the capstone so you see a church in colossians being commended by the first church age messenger that they have an expression of christ in their midst amen god bless you as you're seated while you have your bibles open i want to read several scriptures as we begin let's turn together to ephesians we just go back a couple of books to ephesians chapter one i'm going to read three scriptures in a row just as a refresher and then we're going to continue on ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4. according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will the most wonderful thing that we can know is that god predestinated us amen according to the good pleasure of his will but he didn't just predestinate us to be his child he predestinated us into the adoption of children so he has predestinated us into maturity and to placing amen remember that we've come to this earth to serve his purpose and there's a purpose for each one of us so we haven't just come to this earth to spend time on this earth we've come to serve some purpose in the kingdom of god so he predestinated us unto adoption amen predestination is unto the placing of sluns which you place at a certain level of maturity so god didn't just save you amen so that you could just uh you know say i'm saved and that's it but there was a purpose behind it all amen and that's the thing that gives us so much courage is god will complete the work that he's begun because he purposed for us to do something in this life to serve a purpose to take our position in the body of christ to do something in the kingdom of god and so god has predestinated us unto the adoption of children let's go to the previous book to galatians chapter four we'll pick up one scripture there in galatians chapter four verse six galatians four six and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father so we receive the spirit of his son the spirit of jesus christ and our hearts crying out of a father why because you are sons because you already were a son you receive the spirit of the son where you cry abba father amen let's go to the previous book to romans or a couple books ahead to romans chapter 8. and we'll read one more portion of scripture romans chapter 8 and verse 14. romans 8 and 14. for as many years are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and because you are sons he gave you the spirit of his son amen and we have received the spirit of adoption so what is that spirit that we received it's the spirit of adoption the spirit that will take us to adoption because we've been predestinated to the adoption of children by jesus christ so all these scriptures paint the same picture when we start talking about the virtues and we start talking about the stature of a perfect man if we don't set the foundation right in the word it can become a discouraging conversation because we begin to look at these virtues and say well i mean i've got to measure up to all of this and i've got to add to this to this to this to this but if we don't have the basis of understanding we can get discouraged when there's nothing discouraging in this doctrine whatsoever amen this message did not come to discourage us this message came to give us life this message didn't come to push us away it came to put us in position amen so everything in this message came to unlock our understanding to bring us into our rightful position so there's nothing discouraging in the message amen if the message is presented in a discouraging way it's the wrong ankle preached the wrong way amen and trying to make you the wrong recipient amen but if you're the bride of jesus christ this message came to lift you up and to put you in position to manifest the life of jesus christ and that was according to his purpose and his will not your purpose and not your will so you've been predestinated to make it to the statue of a perfect man now that begins to to flip the whole idea on its head and take it out of our carnal mind and it becomes an exciting doctrine because now this is me amen this is what i am this is who god wants me to be this is what i've been birthed on this earth to express amen it's all mine by these promises by these precious prominence i've been made a partaker of the divine nature so i can partake of this divine nature and become the very thing that i'm looking at and that was god's purpose from before the foundation of the world there's no discouragement here there's only encouragement saying this is you keep climbing amen this is you keep climbing where am i going to stop i'm not going to stop i'm going all the way to the top to express the full life of jesus christ because that's why i was put on this earth and that's why i was born again by the spirit of god amen like we said sunday everything in this world that's birthed his birth to reflect the thing that birthed it and we've been birthed by the spirit of god to reflect god amen so that's our purpose that's why we are here amen we'll take a look at the powerpoint here and in the beginning of stature of perfect man brother benham sets the whole stage the whole tone the whole purpose of the of the sermon he's going to preach he said this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle building the building the living tabernacle the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells so that's the subject that we're talking about is the dwelling place of god in second peter chapter one whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises now listen already in the in the very first verse that we're reading here in verse five whereby are given unto us given unto us not required of us given unto us exceeding great and precious promises so god has given exceeding great and precious promises unto us that by these the exceeding great promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped having already escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust by what being being born again by the spirit of god now we've already escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we've received he's given to us great and precious promises that by these we may be partakers of the divine nature amen praise god how can we fail just partake amen we're supposed to partake just take it in just receive the promises take in the divine nature and become what god has called for us to become he says in verse five and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity whenever you see the word charity it's the word love agape love and so these are where brother branham draws out of this and preaches on the seven virtues and he goes into a statue of a perfect man but he says now remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him see don't try to add it till you're actually born again because if you won't work you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine born-again dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you comes on up all right coming into perfection now so you don't you don't have to i've got to do this and you know it's not like every level we come to i've got a three-step plan for going from faith to virtue amen virtue is already in the seed it's the life it's the word it's the light of the hour that is drawing the nature out of the seed amen everything has already been provided to us brother brahm says when you're a christian you just bear the fruit of the spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up you don't make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be and then it takes care of itself amen he goes on to say and in the same message statue of a perfect man well now that's the way it is try trying to manufacture christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creature now you're getting right now see now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again so you don't have to worry about a dove putting forth dove feathers he was talking about a buzzer taking dove feathers amen and plucking them in themselves he said that's just a hypocrite that's like you trying to have virtues i'm trying to have if you say i'm trying to have brotherly kindness oh brother you're going to fail if you're trying to have brotherly kindness you're destined to fail amen it's got to be something that comes from the inside out amen that's the reality that's the real now in the message blasphemous names he says you cannot join the church of the living god you're borned into it by the baptism of the holy ghost and when you're baptized with the holy ghost these virtues are sealed in you by the holy ghost so he's been teaching us and we've been talking about this for the last uh two services that he begins with the baptism of the holy ghost as a new birth amen and it's the baptism of the holy ghost that raises you all the way up into the very image of the one that birthed you amen it brings you all the way up into the image of christ it's the holy ghost down here it's the holy ghost in every stage and it's the holy ghost up here amen we showed this picture last time and uh this looks like a capstone but really a prism is a three corner to a three-sided piece of glass and then it takes light and it breaks it into the full light spectrum or the seven colors of the rainbow amen and and so the seven colors of the rainbow together are white light amen white light separated is seven colors and brother brandon talks about this and and we use this picture to depict this because he starts talking about the life of christ through seven church ages and when he builds the pyramid he shows seven church ages seven messengers and seven h's and also seven virtues and he says the way he builds his church is the way he builds the individual and so what is it this hovering over this this god amen the the the life of christ amen it has all of these virtues in it so from the beginning it's building all the way back to the image of christ amen and it's christ drawing the life unto himself all seven virtues are what the divine nature the life of christ so when we started our pyramid we started at the top with love we've always like i said before we've always drawn it from the bottom we've always talked about it from the bottom but if there is no top there is no bottom amen if there's no love of god if there's no holy ghost if there's no life of christ drawing us amen there's no starting there's nothing going to happen amen this has to be first amen when this is first it births us into the program of god and draws us up to itself it says building this monument building this stature see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls and is the strength of every one of these things he controls every one of those virtues and he is the strength of every one of these virtues that's right yes sir right in here right in there you see i got in between all these works in here and here these little waves come what is it the holy ghost coming down through christ see holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together welding a lot a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off so the holy ghost is above all of this amen what's he doing he's building what were you birthed for to be built into the image of jesus christ that's what you rebirth for who's doing the work the holy ghost is working in your life and building you into the image of jesus christ so what do we do yield amen surrender give up because he's a master builder and he knows what he's doing so we talked about faith being the foundation of our lives the faith foundation of our christian walk and ephesians 2 8 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that none of yourselves it is the gift of god in galatians 5 6 it says for in jesus christ there is neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love all of these things you'll find work by love it's the love of god because god is love amen and god is working this in our lives why it was his purpose from before the foundation of the world notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him amen so we know that faith also has a resting place and the resting place of faith is on the word of god amen and faith cometh by hearing by hearing the word amen so faith has a resting place our faith has a resting place and our resting place is on the word of god then faith becomes our foundation but we're established on the rock of god's word amen and then faith in that word brings our salvation [Music] now the next one was virtue and virtue here in stature of a perfect man he says well if i'm going to be like jesus i've got to have virtue and a past that it can pass forward from me to people that's an important statement he said if i'm going to be like jesus if i'm going to be like jesus i've got to have virtue and brother of him tells his virtue with strength for when the woman touched the hymn of his garment virtue left him he said i felt virtue go out and he said it pass and a past that it can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds so we find out that god wants to build enough strength he wants us to be established strong strong enough to stand on our foundation of faith now god by his grace amen he quickened to us faith we believe the word of god and by the revelation of god and we need some strength to stand but this virtue is not just enough strength to stand it's enough strength for somebody to draw strength from us amen so if we're going to be like jesus we need virtue enough to stand the trial stand the test stand as a christian but also for somebody else to be able to tap in and pull virtue from us this is going to take a work of the holy ghost amen this is not trying harder and trying to be stronger amen you'll fail you'll fail you'll fail but we need virtue that comes from the holy ghost amen i want to look turn with me to to second peter or yeah ii peter i want to look at something here we just read on the overhead about the virtue starting from verse five to verse seven and verse seven ends with brotherly kindness and then the charity and verse 8 says for if these things be in you and the bound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ so remember the analogy brother branham gives us of the of the boy who's growing up in his father's house and the father wants to establish him in the family business and give him responsibility amen and so he puts him under tutors and governors and he's typing that with us under the holy ghost growing us up amen and he's growing us up to be in the image of his father and he's bringing him to a certain measure of of wholeness a certain measure of maturity where he can say now he's a mature son and he takes that mature son at whatever age that would be deemed amen still a young man amen and he bestows upon him privilege and responsibility and now he's working in the kingdom like his father's working in the kingdom now now he's given responsibility amen but the father doesn't expect that all of his growing will stop right there he's just come to maturity and been placed as a son in the in the economy in the kingdom of the father and he's given responsibility and privileges but he's still going to grow into the likeness of the father because the father is more mature yet so that's for us amen there's a certain level of these virtues that begin to grow in us amen to bring us to a certain maturity so that god can use us now in the work that he has for us to do in this earth but i don't believe that's the end of our understanding about god or growing into the likeness of christ i believe i'm still growing into the likeness of christ do you if not god never be able to use us we'll be at the point of death and say now i'm ready and then we're gone amen but there's a certain level of maturity where we come to as a christian and he says now he i can give him responsibility now he can work in my kingdom but we're still growing so if these things be in you and abound so they can be in you but they can also abound and i'm saying hey i may have some temperance but i want it to abound amen i may have a little virtue but i want it to abound i may recognize that god's given me patience that i've never had before but i want it to abound amen i'm not stopping amen just because i believe god amen has placed me and i believe i know what the lord wants me to do with my life amen i'm not stopping i want all of these things to abound that's why as we begin to preach on this amen the devil can begin to play in your mind because you can be able to see oh i don't have enough temperatures i need more temperatures i must not be a mature sign god must not be able to use me you may have a temperance but you need some abounding amen you can go back to the lord and say lord i need more amen i need more i need more temperance i need more virtue i need more whatever you find you're struggling with as we go through this just ask for more because these things can be in you and abound amen then we come to knowledge the third step is knowledge and you can see as we begin to climb in these virtues amen it begins to take shape amen your life begins to start to reflect something the thing that you're pointed to you begin to look more like christ and act more like christ and it becomes more visible on the outside that's what happens as we mature amen many times when we start our walk with the lord amen it's not as if it's not as if immediately everything is changed and all of a sudden we come out acting exactly like jesus christ no we have to be patient with one another because we all have to grow up we're birthed amen but we're a newborn baby christian and newborn baby christians still get a lot of things wrong amen they still may have rough edges they still may have a bit of a temper you can have a newborn baby christian and he can still tell you off and you thought i thought you told me you were born again but maybe he's just a newborn baby christian that's got to grow up amen that needs to grow into temperance amen and we've got to be patient with one another not cut somebody out every time they do something wrong because if that would have happened to us we would never be where we're at now we'd be gone amen so in knowledge he says and thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but you know but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your creeds and all your unbelief and everything that you claim to have done then you have knowledge to believe that god cannot lie let every man's word be a lie but mind be true see now you're getting knowledge that supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by god so where do these virtues come from from god to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of god yes sir and add knowledge because knowledge of his word we read these two scriptures on sunday second corinthians 4 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ we begin to talk about on sunday that god wants us to know him amen god there's things god wants us to know that's why he put a bible in writing so we could read it it's not that i just you know i just want to love the lord and i want to be in a love relationship with the lord and i want to float around saying i love god and he loves me but god wants you to know him amen he wants you to really love him for who he is not for your idea of what he is so god wants to be known so he gives us his word and then he sent a prophet to unlock the mystery that was in the back part of his mind because god wants us to have knowledge of him and he even sent jesus christ and jesus christ was a fleshly reflection of an invisible god so that god would be more known to the human race because god wants to be known so this kind of godly holy ghost knowledge god wants us to know his word so we know him amen so that we can really truly begin to love him not just love our idea of him so as we mature god gives us some strength and then he gives us that knowledge so that we can be established and also so that we're not like children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine so that we don't you know because every time you know you hear dynamic anointed preaching it doesn't always mean they're telling the truth there's more than one kind of anointing amen so it can be really exciting and it can be thrilling and you can say that's wonderful and we accept this and we go down this path then somebody comes with more thrilling more exciting message and we drop that and we come to this god doesn't want us to be tossed around by that he wants us to be established on the word and give us holy ghost knowledge so that we know him and we know his word and we can be further established amen and grow more into his image and more to his likeness in ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 he says that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints not to the saints that you might know the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints god wants us to come to a supreme knowledge he says i believe in genuine holy ghost knowledge holy ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with amen when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the bible now i don't want to add to what brother bram said but let's take it also for the message in the bible and in the message when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the bible you sit down and study it and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the holy spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it see that's knowledge amen it's holy ghost knowledge where it seems to be a contradiction there's a truth laying there where it seems to be a contradiction to opposing things in the bible or in the message there's a truth theory man so let's just pray about it until the holy ghost moves in and begins to tie the thing together and we can see the whole truth and it'll fit the whole picture of the bible it won't be one isolated little nugget dropped in there that doesn't match the rest of the picture but when the holy ghost comes in with holy ghost knowledge all of a sudden that revelation will fit the whole picture amen and then temperance this is where we finished this on sunday temperance means self-control the virtue of one who has mastered his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites and so when we grow we need self-control amen we need to control this outer man that we dwell in so so you know the word the bible told us that we're taught how to possess how we ought to possess our vessels and so temperance will help us possess our vessels and brother bam says the word temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh he's talking about drinking but we're talking about the holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not to be a tattler how to control your temper not to fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why god is not in his church doing miracles and things that he used to do yes sir see add these things add temperance to it old temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath has spoken to you somebody say you bunch of holy rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now not that but talk with godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're riled upon rile not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the son of god turn these stones into bread you he could have done it and showed he was god but he had temperance when they called him beelzebub he said i'll forgive you for him that's right they pulled handfuls of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing see after you've come to knowledge then you come to temperance where you can now control yourself and you can control yourself because you have a greater understanding you know i was sharing with some brothers recently you know in psalms 27 in psalms 27 david is talking about thou has set me upon a rock and we know a rock is revelation so david was surrounded by his enemies amen but his victory was going to be that god set him up on a rock not that he climbed up on a rock but that god set him upon iraq so god put him based him on a revelation and he says and my head has been lifted above the head of my enemies so what does that mean that means his understanding his revelation his knowledge is lifted above the head of his enemies and now david doesn't have to fight everybody david doesn't have to go tis for tat an eye for eye and this and that because his head has been lifted above everybody he's set upon a rock he has greater understanding and he can be like jesus christ sitting nailed to a cross that father forgive them they don't know what they do how could he said that because he had supreme knowledge he knew the plan of god and he knew that they don't know what they're doing if they knew what they were doing they wouldn't be doing this and when we come to that kind of knowledge on the word and understanding of who we are and what we're here for and what god's doing amen when when somebody begins to mistreat or be unkind or speak evil all of a sudden you can realize they don't understand if they understood amen that's why you know parents can manage children because they know the child doesn't understand they have to manage for their behavior and watch after them and and you know they can spank a little child and the child can turn around and say i hate you it may sting for a minute but they know they don't understand mom doesn't say well i hate you back why because of her knowledge we understand they don't mean it they don't know what we know we can have the same kind of temperance when we come to the correct understanding they don't know what we know they don't understand if they understood they wouldn't say those things amen to be like jesus said when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had seen him perform miracles by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth like that they put a rag around his head like that around his eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesy tell us who hit you will believe you he had temperance now if you've got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and sass and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't got no you you can't add that because it won't add it won't vulcanize you couldn't you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when you when you when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of holy ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it so it's got to be the right kind of temperance this is not uh self-control in the way of like we said before you know grit your teeth count to ten take five deep breaths that's not self-control but temperance is an inner man controlling the outer man temperance is the inner man that's been born again by the spirit finally coming to a level of understanding and maturing where he says okay black dog back a little bit jerk that chain back and say you're not running the show i'm in control you're not chasing after lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life we're not going down that road we don't want those things we're going to turn our head and then we're not going to partake of that we're not going to blow up when somebody says something to us because the inner man is now controlling the outer man that's real holy ghost temperance amen now let's move on to the fifth which is patience i had fun with this one uh it was it was really interesting we look at patients patience is this word here patience but when i get down to the description at the bottom it says steadfastness constancy endurance in the new testament the characteristic of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and is loyal to the faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly this is patience now you can see why patience and temperance are two different things they're not the same temperance is self-control patience is the ability to endure patience is the ability to hold fast and endure and not budge that is patience in james chapter 1 verse 2 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall untied diverse temptations that were temptations means trials or testings knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so patience will perform a good work amen and the trying of your faith work is patience so how do i get more patience by the trying of your faith so what's building patience in me tests temptations manifold temptations many different diverse temptations and trials they're working in us patience but patience will bring us to a perfect man it says patience with what what kind of patience first thing is to have patience with god this is what surprised me when i began to look at this the first thing you have to have is you have to have patience with god he said if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because faith work is patience when god says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well i asked him last night to heal me and i'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience god told abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with god brother i said the first thing you have to have is patience with god you cannot have patience with god if you don't have faith if you don't have some strength to endure if you don't have some knowledge to understand how these things have worked in the bible in the past if you don't know about abraham and about noah and about moses and all this if you don't have that knowledge amen you're not going to have patience and then if you don't have enough tempers to control yourself while you're waiting for the promise amen you'll never come to patience amen so you can see how these things are building one upon another and as we build we become we begin to reflect more of that capstone amen shake more more looking more like christ all the time and this is the kind of patience we have to have patience with god he says noah had patience yeah noah had real godly patience god said i'm going to destroy this world with rain and noah preached 120 years yet plenty of patience not even dew fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years but he was patient then god tries your patience that's right god tries it so how do you get patience by trials when you get patient god tries your patience to build more patience amen now this is when we come when we begin to mature this is when you can begin to some see somebody who would just take god at his word and said i have laid hold of the promise and i know that god is going to move this situation in my life and when you come and see that kind of person that's come to this patience amen they're not down every day and they're also not going to the altar every sunday right because they know i've committed to god it's in his word i'm standing on the word now i'm patiently enduring till god does what he promised me he will do i'm not going back and asking him again i've already asked him amen i'm not i'm i'm not going to doubt whether he heard me and have to say it louder i'm not going to have to wait for a more dynamic ministry i mean i've already asked him amen i've already placed my petition and now i'm going to stand like noah i'm going to wait like abraham i'm going to have this patient endurance knowing that he heard me because i'm his child i prayed the prayer of faith he will answer amen if you go back to god for anything don't go back to say god amen did you hear me just go back to say god i still remember what i said and i still believe i'm just letting you know i'm waiting amen i'm letting you know i'm expecting amen you go back to god all the time you can keep knocking on that door and say god i'm still waiting amen i'm still here i haven't gone anywhere i'm still believing you and i'm still waiting for you to fulfill the word not going back to beg him again would you please do you've already asked him he'll do it but going back to say god i'm still here i still believe i still remember what you said and i'm here lord amen praise god we've got to have holy ghost patience we don't have this patience we'll never progress in the in the stature of a perfect man will constantly be falling back i want to read three scriptures out of the book of hebrew if you'll turn with me to the book of hebrew hebrews and we'll begin with chapter 6 hebrews chapter 6. hebrews chapter 6 verse 12. that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promise so how do they inherit the promise through faith and patience let's go to chapter 10. hebrews chapter 10 verse 36. hebrews chapter 10 and we'll read verse 36 for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise listen listen the way the scripture is worded you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise if you don't read that right you read it in a way that doesn't need any patience after i've done the will of god i get the promise well then why did you need patience because after you've done the will of god you'll receive the promise but you may have to wait on it you need patience so that after you do the will of god you can receive the promise when you know you've done the will of god you know you've believed his word and you know you stood on the word then have patience and wait for god to fulfill the word hebrews chapter 12. now we know that hebrews chapter 11 is what we call the heroes of faith chapter and it goes to enoch and and abel and abraham and sarah and isaac and joseph and moses and so many different heroes of the faith amen but i would i'd like to read chapter 12 the next chapter chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that this will easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us let their example encourage us to run our race with patience looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds so part of the definition of patience is endurance and jesus endured because he had a revelation of what was coming he was able to endure such contradiction of sinners he was able to endure the cross despising the shame because he had a revelation of what was coming next he could see amen and we're supposed to have patience amen and he's to be our example of patience we may have to endure we may have to wait it may be difficult but we if we have patience we'll see the promise fulfilled in our lives the statue of a perfect man says we should have patience with one another so first we have to have patience with god and now we should have patience with one another we got so much impatience with one another brother branham is is is telling us we have to have patience with god first we have to wait we have to endure but we also must wait on our brothers and we must endure with our brothers we have to have patience for one another and one of the most horrible things is for us to have impatience with our brothers and sisters i mean sometimes we'll be so forgiving of somebody in the world and so critical of a brother or sister amen and i mean it's like siblings in a family i mean they can treat they can treat somebody else like gold and they treat their siblings like and part of the reason is is because they know that that sibling knows better like you've heard the same lesson i've heard you got the same mom and dad you know better but not realizing you're five years older than that one i mean come on and we're all growing and we've got to give each other time to grow and we've got to be patient with one another and not cut each other down so quickly amen let's endure with some patience one another this doesn't mean enduring sin amen this is enduring childishness in one another immaturity we need to have patience with one another he goes on to say have patience if you've got patience if you're not you're you're crumbling off of this building here see it'll knock all the rest of it down that one thing if you don't have patience if you don't wait amen it'll begin to crumble the building and knock it down you got to have that don't add it because it'll wreck your building if you haven't got patience if you haven't got virtue to add to your faith that you say you god if you haven't got any faith and try to put virtue on it it'll break your faith down see well now wait a minute maybe this is all a mistake anyhow maybe god isn't gone maybe there is no god see it'll break the thing right in two then you've got to have patience amen so many people and that claim to believe the message didn't have patience while they were waiting for god to fulfill all of his word and they've walked away they've crumbled the building has crumbled but we've got to have patience amen it doesn't matter if we're here another 150 years and the world has fallen to complete chaos you still have to have patience god's going to keep his word it's all going to come to pass amen just because it's been 60 years it may be 60 years more who knows but i'm telling you one thing if you have patience you'll endure to the end and he that endureth to the end will be saved so add to your patience godliness from faith to virtue to knowledge to temperance to patience to godliness and here's how brother benham describes godliness he said fifthly i had godliness oh godliness is to be added what does godliness mean i looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally i was down at brother jeffrey's there we found it in a dictionary godliness this means to be like to be like god oh my after you've got faith virtue knowledge temperance patience then be like god so you say i can't do that brother but i'm oh yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute matthew 5 48 we'll take this one and see what it sounds like matthew 5 48 and see if you're supposed to be like god you know the bible says he are gods jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in god is in you matthew 5 48 jesus speaking in the beatitude be therefore p-e-r-f-e-c-t what's that perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect you got way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up there he's asked you now to be perfect godliness sons and daughters of god so he's asking us to be like god when you get all the way up here to be like god godliness godliness also has a meaning of uh let me see reverence respect and piety towards god amen to respect the things of god and to be like god let's look at colossians chapter 1 verse 14 together it says in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god so who was jesus christ he was the image this word image means a likeness he was the likeness of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature so if you wanted to see god you looked at jesus and jesus was the image of god then it goes on to say in romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so we're supposed to be formed into the image of christ and christ is the image of god so jesus christ is the reflection or the image or the likeness of god and we're predestinated to be conformed into the likeness of jesus christ therefore we're supposed to be like god but we're predestinated to be that way amen we're predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son that we might be that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen are we supposed to be like god yes but we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son and his son was in his image so we will be in his image thank god the next one brother branham goes to is brotherly kindness this is the seventh one the definition of brotherly kindness is brotherly love and the in the description down at the bottom says love of brothers or sisters brotherly love in the new testament the love which christians cherish for each other as brethren i think it's interesting that brotherly love is all the way at the top of the statue of a perfect man right next to god himself and i think it goes to show how essential brotherly love is but also how difficult it is to achieve we're not asked to get to this at the base where it's wide amen but as we're shaping up as we're coming closer and closer and more into the image of christ himself that we are to have this virtue of brotherly kindness or brotherly love showing we couldn't accomplish it at the bottom amen it's got to be right here next to god himself amen this is a difficult virtue and one of the reasons i don't i don't remember if i told you i know i've told you before but brother abraham said one time i don't know if it was here or to me brother abraham myra he says brotherly love can only be expressed when a brother needs love so when somebody's doing wrong amen it's the only time that you can express brotherly love amen is when say when you have to love a brother and he might be doing he might be a little unlovable at the time but brotherly love will love him anyhow amen so this is one of the most difficult virtues but the most essential to being like god is to have brotherly kindness or brotherly love brother brahman says now that's a good one right here the six seven it's the seventh all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we when we got to that brother lee kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him he said seven times a day he said 70 times seven see brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him see we go back to patience no see be kind to him when a brother is all out of tune when a brother gets all out of tune or all out of whack he said don't be impatient with him but be patient with him amen be kind to him i think this is so important amen because it's so easy to cut somebody off and i think sometimes one of the reasons that we cut somebody off is because they their their conduct or their attitude or approach becomes an embarrassment to us because we're associated with them we're associated by being in a fellowship together amen and we're not here to cut people off because we're embarrassed of them we're here to cover for one another amen we're here to love one another we're here to nurture we're here to help a brother grow into all that he is supposed to be but we're not going to do that by being impatient and constantly being critical of one another amen like i said before if somebody is openly in sin then you go to a brother in love not to cast them out but to restore them it's supposed to work by love even correction is supposed to work by love not correction for the sake of the joy of correcting a brother because he's embarrassing me and he better shape up that's the complete wrong attitude but it's a care for a brother's soul i meant actually actually concern for him would cause me to go when i see him out of the way and try to bring him back in line it's love expressed to bring that kind of correction but there's a kind of correction that's not corrective it's critical and criticism is poison it'll destroy criticism just to criticize amen just to point out flaws but with no effort into bringing a brother back in line no spending yourself giving your own energy giving your own time amen being a support just criticizing pointing out the wrong but never being one involved in the restoration it's wrong but you can see how it's all the way up here amen it's hard it's going to take the holy ghost molding christ like character in us for best be able to get up here to this place where we can love our brothers regardless of what they do love them anyhow i can say and when it comes to a brother or sister amen you know the first thing somebody wants to do is when a brother gets out of sorts the first thing we want to do is say well they weren't a brother they must not have been a real believer instead of trying to restore such a one we try to make excuses for their behavior and they're not part of us anyways that's completely wrong if they've been here amongst us if they've been baptized in this church if they've taken communion with us amen we've got a responsibility to try to restore them to cover for them they've been part of us and among us and not so quickly say well they they went out from us because they weren't of us but to actually take the harder road amen when instead of going one mile go the extra mile with the brother amen to try to restore this is brotherly kindness this is brotherly love how do you know brother chad because god did all of this for me amen he did every bit of this for me i had reason to be cast away i had reason for him to quit fooling with me i had reason to be criticized but he in love kept coming to me and pulling me back coming to me and pulling me back over and over and over again i think we need a good healthy dose of brotherly love and it's got to be in the church there's no there's no way around it if we believe we're at the end of the end of the end and i could ask for a show of hands but i'm not going to because everybody every one of us sees the world in chaos we're at the end of the end of the end of the end we should have the highest level of brotherly love that's ever been expressed before amen that's why i love amen when i see the way the individuals in the church take care of one another care for each other fellowship and make meals and call and write cards amen it does my heart good because that's the way it ought to be amen this should be expressed this should be the highest level that has ever been on the face of earth in the gentile church the highest level of brotherly love should be now we should be at that time amen where it's being expressed and so when i see the assembly those caring for one another i say praise god that's the way it should be when i see somebody reaching out to somebody else it does my heart good because that's where we should be friends we've got to make sure that we don't allow that spirit of criticism to enter in because it'll be poison for us and poisoned for the one who's being criticized but it's going to take a whole lot of brotherly love and there's a whole lot of brotherly love to be had amen we're going to read some scriptures and we're going to see how true this is john 13 34 jesus says a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you so how should you love your brother the same way jesus loved you with the same amount of love with the same amount of forgiveness with the same amount of effort because he says that you love one another as i have loved you so how has jesus loved you that's how you should love your brother [Music] as i have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have loved one to another jesus never told them that they'll know you're my disciples because of the signs and wonders but you'll know because of this kind of love because you love one another as i have loved you what a sign to the world when the world has no more true love there's no true love left in the world what a what a sign to the world a people who can love each other forgive each other so we can we can step on each other's toes and still love each other and embrace one another first peter chapter 1 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned that means without hypocrisy genuine unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently these are strong words amen this is not just you're supposed to love each other but see that you you love each other with a pure heart fervently he's not just saying love one another it's going beyond that love each other with a pure heart fervently that's intently with strength amen but it says as john of old he's talking about john the apostle when he got too old to preach he would just sit and scream they tell me with all of his might little children love one another love one another don't let nothing come among you see i think it's interesting brother branham when he comes to preach christ is the mystery of god revealed if you've read the beginning of christ as the mystery of god revealed one of the greatest messages he ever preached amen where he's really uh unlocking the mystery of the seventh seal when he comes to the beginning of that message he starts saying now you're one sweet group now but satan won't let it stay that way and he starts to give instructions on how to love one another and what to do if somebody comes in and starts causing division he said you just get sweeter and tighten that much up closer together and the one that satan's using the the to bring dissimilation you just love him and he'll either change or leave brother brahm didn't say call him out have a meeting expose all the wrong things they said he says you love them that much more and they'll either be changed or they'll leave so what was the approach for trouble more what was the approach for somebody causing dissimulation not to dissimulate but gather that much tighter together and love more so what is the cure more love more brotherly kindness is the cure to troubles amen so when he comes to the beginning of christ as a mystery god revealed i thought it was so stunning that he would lay that in right there after the seals and he would begin to show us amen the devil is always coming to try to come in and disrupt brotherhood he's always trying to bring a division he's always trying to drive a wedge and brother branham said don't you let it happen amen you've just received one of the greatest revelations that has ever struck to earth the seals have been open amen that time is now i'm coming to preach the threefold purpose of god but this one thing you have to guard against you have to protect brotherly love praise god let's take the lesson let's not skip through that page and say okay what's that threefold purpose no i mean what's the what's the point of knowing everything if you can't love one another amen i mean you may be able to explain all the bible verses in the world amen but nobody will know that you're his disciple if you don't have loved one for another it wasn't your knowledge of the word that declares your discipleship it was the love you have one for another and the statue of a perfectly man says somebody said not long ago said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god and the oneness and all the rest then put c brotherly kindness how can you do it brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday god will bring him in see brotherly kindness the seventh thing one two three four five six seven he says the seventh thing now now you're coming the next in add charity which is love that's the capping stone and we can't jump over all of these things to the capping stone they must be in us and abound we must have these virtues in us and we must strive for them and we must protect them and not let the devil strip them out of us but we must have all of these in here to come into the very image of jesus christ which is what we're predestinated to do and i thank god amen that his spirit has anointed us to have brotherly love there's an anointing upon this word there's an anointing from the spirit to have brotherly love that why is it that we love each other so much why is it that the trustees can barely lock the doors on wednesday night because we don't want to leave the fellowship amen what is that that's brotherly love is that just you no that's god amen expressing through you amen because the attributes of god are part of god and god is love and you can't help but love your brother he's an expressed attribute of god it is god loving god it is god embracing god it is god fellowshipping with god it's an addiction you can't get away from it because these are two these are two parts of god that are polarized to one another they cannot separate that's brotherly love the holy ghost is building brotherly love and the capstone is the perfection so all of these attributes have come back together and it's christ himself is what it is christ himself living in the individual god dwelling in a tabernacle of human flesh expressing his purpose in this world the statue of a perfect man he says did you ever hear this now let me tell you this and keep put this on your listening put on your listening ear a chain is its strongest at its weakest link that's right it's no stronger than its weakest link no matter how strong these are built up this is built up if you've got a weak link there's where she breaks and it's no stronger than its weakest link now if you possess you say you've got this this this you don't have this there's where she breaks if you got this and haven't got that she'll break right there you got this and haven't got that it'll break this and haven't got this it'll break this and haven't got this it'll break and you can't have this without having this see when you surrender your complete being then the holy spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living tabernacle then people look out and say there's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the holy ghost see here there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you've never seen a kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed a seal shows on both sides wherever you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost they can somebody can see your life now i want you to look at the attributes that brother branham is talking about when somebody says that's a man of god that's a woman of god you've never seen a kinder sweeter gentler praise god we want to have the divine nature the the whole purpose that god has purposed for us in this age is that she will be him amen we are to be him that means this divine nature has to be on full display in us there's no shortcuts there's no workarounds there's no freebies there's no give me's we've got to have his divine nature by the holy ghost let's look at first john chapter 4 together i want to read this scripture together first john chapter 4. i'm going to begin reading it verse 7. first john chapter 4 verse 7. beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know ye know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of the spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that hateth not his brother for for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he may loveth that that he who loveth god love his brother also there's no way around it friends this is why brother brahm said john this is the apostle john he was the last of the apostles to survive the last of jesus disciples to survive and he was an old man after he came back from the island of patmos he was an old man when he went to the island of patmos he was an old man when he came back and and they said brother brahm said that that he was told the histories tell that he would just sit he's too old to preach couldn't stand and break the word and preach anymore but he would cry out with all that was in him my little children love one another his last message his greatest message the thing that he said last in his final moments his final days or weeks or years when his strength was failing there was one message he wanted to get one last word that if he could drop in their heart one last admonition that if you could get to them they would have it all and he says my little children love one another if you say we love god who we've not seen but we hate our brother who we've had seen then we're a liar because god who i have not seen is reflecting in my brother who i have seen because that's the point that my brother will be a reflector of god and come into the image of the son and if that image expressing the father i don't love how can i say i love the father you're a liar he said but if i love god and the love of god is in me i'll love my brother because god's in my brother and god's in me and will love one another that doesn't mean we don't correct one another that's love also but it has to be motivated by love and it has to be done in love it doesn't mean that everything is acceptable some behavior is unacceptable but the correction must come by love and in love not criticism not casting out but really loving one another and i think this is in the day and age we live in the most difficult virtue to be expressed but when it's expressed you have found god you have found the dwelling place in god of god when you found the people that can love one another despite it all hey will you make another mistake yes i love you anyhow will i say something sometime to hurt your feelings yes love me anyhow has your husbands as your wife ever said anything that hurt your feelings you loved her anyhow wife has your husband ever hurt your feelings you love him anyhow we love our brothers and sisters anyhow because that's where god dwells that's where my lord is dwelling in that vessel and i love my brother did he hurt my feelings sure he did but he didn't mean it amen can you say that not i've got to go i got exhibit a exhibit b exhibit c i've got to straighten that brother why didn't we just say he didn't mean it dude like jesus did father forgive them they don't know what they're doing why can't we just say why has it always got to be fixed and fixed and fixed when it's just a brother he says something insensitive it's just a sister she did something insensitive they didn't mean it anyhow just let it go they say god i forgive them and i pray you forgive them too that's my brother they didn't mean it amen she didn't mean it they didn't mean to say that they didn't mean to do that i mean as they mature they'll be sorry for that later is there anything that you think back on let's say you think five or six years back is there any thought you have about a discussion you had with anybody or something you said in a group setting and you and you're like oh my goodness i can't believe i said that i can't believe i did that or has that only happened to me we can look back and say oh i was so immature i should have never said that that was the wrong setting i i'm so embarrassed that i said that hey listen somebody's going to say something like that to you or in a group setting or to you amen and five years later they're going to look back and say oh that is so embarrassing i wish i wouldn't have said that let god deal with it let people mature let them grow up and say just forgive them just let it go my brother didn't mean that my sister didn't mean that i love him anyhow this is the hour for that kind of expression and if we love them like that they'll mature so much faster amen and the statue of a perfectly man he says now that is the house that god dwells in not a building with a big bell on top of it and a high steeple but a body has thou prepared me a body that god can dwell in can walk in can see and can talk and god can work in amen living instrumentality of god god walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of god god walking in you for ye are written epistles read of all men and if the life that's in christ be in you you'll bear the life that christ bore [Music] jesus christ didn't just live for his brothers he also lived for the sinner he lived for the co-worker at work that has done you rotten jesus lived for them can you live for them can you shine the light a dark place for somebody who would spit on you if they had the opportunity jesus did and his life is now to live in us we're supposed to reflect the same kind of light same kind of life so now we've put the blood of jesus christ in see and that brings the faith of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ the temperance of jesus christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of jesus christ and the love of god which is jesus christ he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation of faith amen controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues i say god i want to be a partaker of the divine nature by the promises that you've given me this is the life i want to live let's finish by reading a portion of scripture from first corinthians together and we'll close with this first corinthians chapter 13. musicians if you'd like you can go ahead and make your way up brother john you can make your way up first corinthians chapter 13. chapter 13 verse 1 though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity i become a sounding brass our tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove a mountain and have not charity i am nothing because what's the goal the love of god the goal is to think like god to love like god the sacrifice like god to give like god that's the goal and if we have all of these wonderful gifts and have not love we're still nothing we still haven't met the goal i want to read that again though i give the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice is not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity that's why brother brenham said if i could have just one thing any gift any ability any working in the spirit if i could have one thing i'd want love. and after looking at the statue of a perfect man i understand why because god is love and love is the whole pyramid love is christ love is the whole picture more than any gift more than any dynamic ability more than anything we should want to have god's love we should want to come into the very likeness and image of god himself above everything else that's the target that's the goal and that is what we have been ordained to achieve in this day this is not something that's far away this is not a hope so this is not even one of those sermons that you preach like this is the goal i mean we'll never make it really in this life but we should keep driving no this is what we've been predestinated for this is why amen the seals have opened this is why the holy ghost has come back in the church in full measure to bring the full life of jesus christ back into flesh this is for us to live this is for us to express all of these virtues are available we by the promises can be partakers of the divine nature i say let that truth encourage us to keep moving forward keep growing keep walking if these virtues be in you let them abound the virtues being you and and for many of you look around the virtues are there you've come to maturity i see god using you but let's let the virtues abound amen and let's live the full life of jesus christ upon this earth man god bless you let's stand this is not the message of the carrot on the stick to keep the mule moving forward there is no stick there's only the divine promises of god that we can be partakers of the divine nature there's not another church age there's not another generation there's not this isn't for somebody else this is for you and i it's preached not out of reach it's preached so that we can reach out and take it it's been given to us let's take let's just receive the let's be partakers of the divine nature and let it work that good work inside of us amen and let's be changed into the thing that we're looking at and come into the very image of the thing we're looking at which is jesus christ in all of his glory that's what this message is this message is christ christ has been unveiled so we can see all of him and we can become what we're looking at let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we thank you god that you've given us a promise and this promise come because of predestination god if it wasn't for predestination lord none of us would be able to attain to anything because in our own strength we're failures to begin with we've been sowed into hybridization we've been born in weakness and we're not capable in ourselves but that's why lord you determined before the foundation of the world that you were going to have a church without spot or wrinkle now you you were going to send the word lord that would chip away all of the misunderstanding that would move away all of the doubts and all the fears lord so that we could see lord who you really are and lord if we can behold you in all of your glory we can become what we're looking at you know and i just pray that you would allow each one of us to be a partaker of your divine nature god that by the promises you've given to us we would have faith just to reach out and receive more to take more lord of your faith and virtue more lord of your temperance and your patience and your godliness lord and your brotherly kindness and all that love let it weld together in us all this virtue so that we would be in your very image upon this earth and lord not that it would have to be that we have to tell everybody who we are but lord they'll know they'll sense it already they'll know this is a child of god that's in my presence because of the nature god we ask that you would bless us as we go from here help us to live in this world as you would live lord you're tabernacled in us let us go out with that consciousness daily lord and live the life you've called us to live we love you and we thank you for what you're doing in us we can see it lord and we want more let these virtues abound in us lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you brother john let the beauty of jesus be seen in me [Music] all his wonderful passions [Music] [Music] beauty of jesus beauty of jesus [Music] wonderful passions [Music] of jesus oh let the beauty of jesus be seen in me all is [Music] [Music] can't you see [Music] why i'm so happy [Music] cause i've accepted [Music] [Music] oh can't you see what i'm so happy for i've accepted the word of the lord [Applause] [Music] by the prophet [Music] oh can't you see why i'm so happy for i've accepted [Music] [Applause] by the prophet [Music]
