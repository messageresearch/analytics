with your program Lord so that we're not doing anything to hinder Lord but may we do everything we can to youi father I pray that you would Lord bless us as we look into your word open our hearts Lord and come and speak to us break the bread of life as only you can Lord you're the only one who can give Revelation we're asking that you would do it now do it for each of us Lord we ask you would have your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you I just wanted to give you a quick update on Brother Rich Ley I just found out just before service that he came through the surgery well the surgeon said everything went well and he was being at the time I talked to his family he was being moved to ICU for recovery so let's just pray that the Lord will bring him through the recovery process quickly and I know that many are still out sick sick with colds and flu and Co and everything else amen but God's healing us he's delivering us amen so many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord deliver them from them all God bless you brother daring sister Farah it's good to see you here I know you guys got hit pretty hard as well but praise God Amen know every time we're sick it's miserable but when we come out of it we thank God for his healing power and it makes us appreciate what Redemption purchased for us what Calvary purchased for us and Redemption we have a new appreciation for it every time we've been sick amen while we're standing let's turn to Mark chap 1 and look into the word I'm I'm still in the same thought pattern that I've been in the Lord has really been dealing with me in the same line of thinking but it as you know it just always keeps expanding the word is so Dynamic amen it it's been it's been fixed from before the foundation of the world in the mind of God but it certainly has not been fixed in us it's growing and growing gr and growing amen as it expands the Revelation expands to us um so let's look at Mark chapter 1 verse 7 verse 6 and John was clothed with camel's hair and with and with a girdle of skin about his loins and he did eat Locust and wild honey and preach saying there cometh one mightier than I after me the latches of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose I indeed have baptized with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen God bless you as you're seated and may God bless us as we look into his word amen I want to take from here this is when uh John first introduces to in the New Testament he introduces to the concept that there will be a baptism of the Holy Ghost and John says I have indeed baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and when we look at this word baptized is the same word baptized used both times baptized in water and baptized with the Holy Ghost and the word means literally to dip repeatedly to immerse or to submerge and so just like in water baptism when we baptize somebody in water we immerse them completely or submerge them under the water amen there's another there is another word uh that's a shortened version of this word in the Greek that means to dip but it's a quick dipping amen and it's a it's a temporal quick dipping but this is a full immersion a full submersion okay it's a it's a little more intents of a baptism and so the water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Ghost uses this same word an immersion or or a sub to to submerge something and so for a title this evening I'd like to take immersed in the Holy Spirit immersed in the Holy Spirit and I just want to work with that thought as we look into these things let's go to Acts chapter 1 together Acts chapter 1 and verse4 here we're going to have Jesus addressing the the disciples after his resurrection in Acts 1:4 and it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so Jesus picks up the same terminology the same thing that John told him after his resurrection he's confirming John baptized you with water amen but you're going to be baptized amen with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so we picked this up in Acts chapter 2 in Acts chapter 2 verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so here we see the the promise being fulfilled the promise of the fathers has now come and it came in such a mighty Dynamic way Amen in this this initial outpouring they were all waiting like he had told them he told them to wait until they were endured from power from on high and he told them to wait in Jerusalem not to move out until they had received this power and and so here we find it in in Acts chapter 1 it was promised from John the Baptist it was confirmed again from Jesus Christ himself after his resurrection and he said not many days hence and here we are about 40 Days Later approxim 40 days later when Pentecost was fully come in they were all together in one Accord in the upper room and the promise came according to what he said according to the appointed time amen and the the the it came as a rushing Mighty Wind amen clothing tongues of fire the the brother B said the pillar of fire was divided out and over each of them in a visible way showing that the pillar of fire was coming back to dwell in the individual amen and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen so they were uh filled this is another term they were immersed baptized submerged but also to be filled amen because when you are submerged amen if you're able to hold this Holy Ghost you can be filled with it amen praise God brother Bram says in questions and answerers on the Holy Ghost I have quite a few quote so I may not give every reference uh and I might just read little short sections out of them because I have quite a few and I know it's a Wednesday night so don't get tired if I start quoting but there's some phenomenal things that the prophet teaches us and I want to look at that in in light of what we want to talk about and all the way back in 59 questions and answers on the Holy Ghost he said and we find out the Holy Ghost is God himself in you praise God the Holy Ghost is God himself in you not a third person not another person not another being but it is God it is the holy spirit which is the spirit of God and it is the it it is God himself in you amen God was above you in the pillar of fire with Moses God was in you in Jesus with uh God was with you in Jesus Christ now God is in you in the Holy Ghost no three Gods one God working in three offices spoken words The Original Seed he says and when so the B Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ cuz you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls so now he's going to introduce this concept this is what I want to get into he's introducing the concept of a predestinated seed and now there's a predestinated seed laying in the earth amen and our bodies are the Earth but inside of our Earth is the seed amen and he says when the rain when he says when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls so now he's typing the rain with the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit Falls Amen on a predestinated seed the life and the seed produces itself which what life would be that what would it be if it's a seed of God it'll produce the life of God Amen so we want to follow this thought through he said when it fell on those seeds Jesus said he chose them when before the foundation of the world when they were a predestinated seed is that right then here they haul themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word and the Word was laying on there without life in it all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as Waters begin to gush out and it actually filled all the house where they were sitting and the seeds be to grow it began to manifest itself and the word of God being manifested so now he takes this and he tells us what was going on in the upper room in the upper room there were those amen that had a predestinated seed within them amen and that predestinated seed was part of the word of God it was an attribute of God and God is the word amen and and so they had a part of the word an attribute of God a gene of God a predestinated seed within them in their soul amen and brother brandham said it was it was there amen let's let's read it again as he says it they hauled themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word so what were they they were the word amen they were a part of the word that had to come into manifestation amen and the Word was laying there without life in it now now brother bam uses so much terminology to describe things to us to explain what's happening amen but we know that if it ever had eternal life it always had eternal life is that right amen so it had eternal life there was already life in the seed but it was laying there dormant it needed something to spring it to life it needed a quickening power to Quicken it from its dorcy or of lifelessness into life it wasn't that there was no life there it was an eternal predestinated C Gene of God an attribute of God you can't call it dead but it's laying there in a dead form and it's laying there in an inanimate form in a dormant State waiting for something to trigger it to life and what it needed was what the seed in the ground needs it needs the rain it needs the water it needs the moisture to bring it to life it had to be immersed in the spirit and that immersion in the spirit would fill it up amen and it would spring to life and he says there and the seeds begin to grow amen and the token he says now you are his oh because he is we have the right to all that he purchased for us every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you remember he says true baptism of the holy spirit amen there's a reason he says true baptism of the Holy Spirit and we're going to get into that as we progress but when he has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and every Theologian will have to admit that to be yes sir it's the new birth you are born a new of the Holy Ghost and because the holy because that God has did this you know and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you in into his kingdom by the holy spirit amen so let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 together Ephesians chap 4 and verse 30 Ephesians 4 and3 says and grieve not the holy spirit of God where be you are sealed until the day of redemption so we look at this baptism of the Holy Ghost is is also typed with the new birth the true baptism Holy Ghost is typed with the new birth which is also being filled with the spirit which is also being sealed until the day of your Redemption it accomplishes all of these things the true baptism of the Holy Ghost accomplishes the new birth amen which is the filling of the Holy Ghost or the indwelling of Jesus Christ or God himself and you which also seals you into the day of redemption now we want to know why the true baptism of the Holy Ghost accomplishes all these things says in the message leadership he says you are here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you're a gene a spiritual Gene out of your heavenly father a part of God's word that explains it friends so that God when God sends down the rain the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon you amen he's doing it for a very specific reason amen because there's something in you that is laying there that must come to life it's a word that is predestinated to be expressed in the hour that we're living God doesn't send his word in vain amen he sent out his word and he said my word shall not return unto me void but it'll accomplish that which I sent it for so if you're part of that word that he sent into the Earth he sent it as a seed a gene an attribute in your soul amen and you are part of the word so go God has to send down the spirit to the moisture the water to immerse you Amen to bring to life that word so that word that he predestinated from his mind can come into manifestation and become the living word for this day that's the purpose amen there's so many uh there's so many times we can talk about amen these terms the baptism of the Holy Ghost seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost having the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we must understand to me I'm one to understand what is it what is it for what is it supposed to do I don't just want to throw out terms amen and sometimes terms we can have terms with different understanding different meanings but I want to know what brother benam was talking about what is this great power of the Holy Ghost supposed to do for me it is supposed to bring me alive amen bring a seed of God alive within me it's it's an experience of what an experience of the new birth what is the experience of the new birth a change your soul change something you changed the old things died you became a new creature in Christ Jesus it's a literal New Birth a spiritual New Birth amen this is why for me so many times if we put the emphasis on the wrong thing we put the emphasis on on what whatever we put the emphasis on Amen we can stay stuck in that emphasis and be satisfied because we had an emotional experience be satisfied because something manifest or some gift worked amen but unless we realize that the whole purpose of this immersion in the spirit is to get down to that seed I have to be fully dipped submerged emerged amen down into the very spiritual presence of almighty God I have to come in contact with the very spirit of God himself the Living God and I must be immersed in that presence for what reason so I can walk out and say I had such an experience no so that what's laying dormant inside can come alive and begin to manifest it's for the purpose of the new birth it is equated with the new birth that's why it's also a seal because once that seed has come in contact with that life there's no reversing it once that word that's laying there waiting for its counterpart to come and Quicken it it's laying there waiting for something it's waiting for the promise of the father to what to bring it to life once that seed that Gene that attribute that word once it's laying there amen and that immersion of the spirit of God comes upon it amen not just upon your flesh not just upon your spirit but all the way down to the soul and connects with an eternal attribute of God all of a sudden that Springs the life amen in the real you the genuine you what was intended to be you amen the Son of God from before the foundation of the world Springs to life and a new birth your soul is changed your desires is changed what you want is changed your appetites is changed amen now all your focus is on Christ only and you don't want the things of the world anymore more why you're a new birth once your birth once these two things come together you cannot tear them apart again you cannot put it back dormant you cannot let it lay there as dead it's already been sprung to life it is sealed until the day of redemption it these two parts have come together infused Amen in a union in a new birth amen and you're not going to undo that it is a seal it is so much like natural reproduction amen because there is a seed that comes from the male to the female into the womb of the female at natural reproduction amen but the seed can come and the seed can go the seed can come and the seed can go but in order for there to be a conception life amen uh uh to bring a birth there has to be something in the wound amen that can connect with this seed there has to be two parts that can come together and fuse and Link together and once the egg and the seed have come together infused amen they are predestinated for one another they are linked to one another they meant for one another but this egg is sitting there waiting for life to come to it amen it can never come to life till life comes to it but it's got the potential amen it's a mate it's a match it's waiting for its counterpart and when the counterpart comes to it there's a there's a fusion T takes place and a life that begins to form amen and that's irreversal now it's sealed amen it's destined to come forth that's why the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth is the filling of the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God Amen I thank God to live in the day where the prophet of God has explained these things to us the Mysteries are being revealed what for to root us and ground us so we're not tossed by every wind of Doctrine and the slide of men's hands as they cunningly devise fables amen we're not getting tossed by this Doctrine and this Church's Doctrine but we're established in the solid word of God we know who we are we know what's happened to us we know why it's happened to us and we know what results it's supposed to bring amen amen in the Rapture message the prophet said then how do we get into this body 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all baptized into this body by one Holy Spirit baptism that if you want to put that down in First Corinthians 1213 and by one Spirit we're all baptized and the spirit is the Life of Christ amen I thought it was God Amen it is the spirit is the Life of Christ is that right and the life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was he was the word seed brings the seed to life you get it if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed life it's the same life it's the same life comes to it it'll bring that seed what was he he was the word is that right he was the word this is why brother brandham says when he walked by the Sea of Galilee you were there with him when he raised the dead you were there why he was the fullness of the word made bodily amen and you amen and when I say you listen when I talk about you I'm not talking about the part my eyes see I'm talking about the part that God predestinated before the foundation world to be a Son of God this outside flesh is born in hybridization it's got corruption all over it's got a cabor nature that goes with it and it's only doing its best to reflect another life that's on the inside side but when I say you I'm talking about the life that's deep in the inside that's the you I'm talking about amen and you are part of that word that's why you were there with him he was expressing the life of that word The Life of Christ the anointed word he said my father will send you the comforter you'll send it in my name but then he goes on to say but I will come to you he says I and my father will come to you make our Abode with you who's coming back it's that same life what is it it's the life of the word are the life of the seed so the seed that is in within me amen the real me the Son of God is the same kind of seed he was the fullness this is just a portion he was the word this is part of the word but the life that left that word at Calvary now when that life comes on it's the life of the word and when the life of the word connects with the word it Springs it to life so if the life is laying in the seed so you realize there must be a life laying in that seed brother vom called it a germatize seed he has so many ways of describing this amen he says he calls it a gerti seed and he talks about it uh uh in in uh the fourth seal and in the fourth seal he talks about there was seeds laying under the Earth after the destruction of the Earth in Genesis 1:2 amen there was seeds laying there from another civilization or something like that amen and when God brought the right conditions he knows that there was seeds down there amen that were gerti seeds there was other seeds there that were germatize they were burned out by the waters is what he said but the one seed that had life in it when God parted the waters and brought the light and he brought the conditions right amen the life that was in that seed connected with the light amen and it sprung forth the life and began to produce what was ever in the seed so he's typing that with us under our Earth under a shroud of Darkness under a clouded spirit amen under under the darkness of deception of Corruption of hybridization all under all this Darkness amen there's a seed laying down there amen some seeds were not dermatiti they already have life in them what are they waiting for to connect with the same kind of life and when life comes to life when word comes to word when Eagle comes to Eagle what does it do it comes to life when when it's immersed in the spirit I want to I want us to catch that the immersion in the spirit he he goes on to saying God's power to transform God through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word and when the life and the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is when the life in the word that's down inside of you amen meets the life of the spirit which is the life of the word when those two come together it produces whatever the seed is so why you can't take the seed of a dog amen and mix it with the egg of a cat you can't take the seed of a chimpanzee and mix it with the dra you understand they've got to be two parts of the same thing that come together so the life of the word and the word have to come together amen and when it comes together it brings life and questions and answers on the Holy Ghost brother B says oh brother sister we're at Katie barer you're tasting now last night the Holy Spirit fell upon us come in us like a a rushing wind it settled upon many of you today ministers have been visiting homes here and there laying on hands and praying for them that seeking the Holy Ghost don't you take a substitute don't you take some kind of noise don't you take some kind of sensation you wait there until God has molded you and made you a new creation a new creature made you a new person amen what are we looking for amen we must have an experience of the baptism of Holy Ghost what is that experience the experience is something changed me so don't take just a noise don't take just a sensation amen and listen when brother B says this he's not telling you don't have a noise and don't have a sensation many of us had Sensations at the baptism of Holy Ghost many of us had different manifestations and many experiences and Supernatural experiences and Sensations amen it's not he's not excluding it he's telling us not to focus on that and seek that that may come that may not come it may come in a variety of different manifestations for different individuals but the thing that we're watching for is that there's something that comes upon me that actually quickens something inside of me and there's a change that takes place within till I'm a new creature amen till my desires have changed till my focus has shifted that's what we're waiting for that's what he's telling the people to watch for that's why he says don't take some noise don't take some sensation amen because there can be a sensation there can be a sensation that falls but it may not have fell deep enough yet it may have just Fallen upon your spirit and you got excited and you had a sensation and you get up and shout and dance but until you've had a full submersion in the spirit and that Spirit has touched that life in your soul amen it's not finished it's not a finished work yet amen right there must be an immersion that brings the seed to life makes us a new creature a new person Amen in the message does God ever change his mind about his word he says says then you the devil will punch at you I love this he'll say everything to you and accuse you and try to make you think that you're not but don't listen to him now you know you've passed from death into life you know the things that you once love you don't love no more you know that you have believed every word of God you've seen God working right Among Us with infallible proofs that he is The Great I Am brother re saying the devil's going to try to make you believe they might make you think that you're not but don't you listen to him says you know you passed from Death to life you know that the things you once loved you don't love no more every time brother B starts getting down to the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen he starts pointing at a changed life said your soul changed didn't it how will you know your soul changed didn't it he said you used to do this and you used to love this and you used to be entangled with the world but something changed he said what did that and he starts talking about now it's not just the change there's a change but that change moves all your focus to Christ and now the only thing you want is the word amen and you line up to the word and you believe the word and you follow the word and you never reject the word and that's the evidence he's talking about of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was sent to lead and guide us unto all truth all truth amen it will not lead and guide us into a false and it won't lead us into a rejection of truths amen but it'll lead us into all truths I go back I want to go back and just read a small excerpt that I talked about last time I preached from the private interview the only private interview that I know of that we have a recording of is with sister Bruce and of all the private interviews and all the information we'd love to have and all the things we'd love to know he said God preserved one and he preserved one because amen this I this is my personal belief I believe God allowed this to come through because we would need what was on this private interview because we were coming out of a Pentecostal Revival as it was fading and dying Pentecostalism had gotten the wrong Focus Amen brother brandham started saying amen actually brother brandham started calling the Pentecostal preachers 2x4 preachers you know what he meant by 2 by4 Acts 2 and 4 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and he says they become two by4 preachers that's all they're preaching because they haven't gone on to preach what the Holy Ghost was supposed to do and where it's supposed to take us amen supposed to bring us all the way into adoption and because we were coming com out of the Pentecostal Revival with all the ideas that would carry over Amen brother Brandon would allow this little Our God would allow brother BR to have this interview with this woman and this one would be taped and this one is be the one that we have and she says to brother Branham but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I can put my foot on brother said all right notice this ordinary a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of human being Sister Bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once what changed it she says Christ said there you are sister that's it she wanted an experience she could put her foot on and brother Brenham gave her one something changed you what was it that she said Christ he said there you go sister that's it and it didn't just change you listen it wasn't just change you like all of a sudden I I I I I didn't drink anymore and didn't smoke but it changed you from that but it changed you into something it changed you into a lover of the word amen to where you go all the way you can stop drinking but reject this word and it wasn't the Holy Ghost you can quit committing adultery and become faithful to your wife but if you if you if you turn away from this word then that's not the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost will lead and guide you into all truth there's a change that takes place inside and it changes you away from things but it changes you to things it turns you away and points you and leads you all the way through all the way to the end praise God he goes on now now this is where I want to uh keep teaching I want to teach some of the other side now and the suan church age out of the church age book says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God I want you to catch that he's not just saying your flesh that flesh has to be made over again we know that but he says it's the Eternal thoughts which that's you the real you the Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God God what are the sons of God the Eternal thoughts the seed the word the G and now it's manifest in flesh amen they are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken so what did the baptism of the Holy Ghost come for the Merion the submer to be submerged in the spirit of God came to do what it came to Quicken the predestinated seed to life in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen but that immersion for the seed of God came to Quicken it's the rebirth we were not reborn we did not become seed we were not become seed because we were Reborn we were reborn because we were already seed you can't be birthed Amen in this process unless the seed is already there because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened this is so important to understand now we're seeing the power not just the power but the purpose of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Matthew 5:45 if we could turn there together look at this scripture Matthew 5:45 Matthew 5:45 he says that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the east evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust this is a concept that brother brenham's going to teach on he's going to teach on this in relation to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he sends he he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust in the church age book when you get into the pergan church age section he says now let me tell you I was shocked what brother benam is referring to is when he went to Mishawaka Indiana as a young Baptist Minister he was coming through from a fishing trip and he stopped over and he saw a gathering of the Pentecostal people the Oneness Pentecostal people and he saw amen manifestations of the spirit speaking in tongues and interpretations of tongues and he saw amen that one would speak with tongues and another one would interpret and somebody from the back would get up in response and go and commit their life to Christ and he was amazed and he wanted to talk to them because he knew he had a gift of discernment he knew be able to know and he began to talk to the first brother these two main Brethren that were used in this way in these meetings he talked the first time one and he said he would he found a humble genuine Christian brother and he goes and he speaks to the next one and he said if there ever was a hypocrite that was the guy said he was married to a blonde woman but living with a brunette and had two children by her and he said he was proud and boastful and arrogant amen and brother brenon was confused and left the whole thing alone and that's what he's referring to now when he gets to this section of the church age book said now let me tell you I was shocked how could I not be here were two men one of them was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the Spirit I was troubled by this confusion I left the meeting to seek God for the answer I went alone to a secret place and there with my Bible I prayed and waited on God for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read I casually open the Bible to some place in Matthew I read for a while and then laid the Bible down in a moment the wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the Bible to Hebrews chapter 6 I read it through and was particularly impressed by the strange verse this those strange verses Hebrews chapter 6 4 for9 ver Verses 4 to9 and we're going to read it here for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again into repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessings from God but that which bearth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end it is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak then he goes on to say I Clos the Bible laid it down and meditated a while and prayed some more I still had no answer I again to open the Bible aimlessly but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room again and once more the pages turned to Hebrews 6 and remained there as the wind ceased I read those words over again and when I did then came the spirit of God into the room and into the room and I beheld a vision I saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a flesh freshly plowed field and sewed grain it was a bright day the sewing was done in the morning but late at night after the sewer and white had gone a man in Black came and stealthily SED some more seed amongst that which the man in White had sown the days went by the the the Sun and Rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared the grain how fine it was but a day later appeared the tears the wheat and tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drank in the same sun and Rain then one day the skies turned to brass and the plants all began to droop and to die I heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to God for rain the tears also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the Lord and to my wonderment I heard the revived tears also look up and say hallelujah then I knew the truth of the camp meeting in the vision the parable of the sewer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews now this Parable the SE seed and the uh SE and the seed you can find it in Matthew I believe chapter 13 yeah Matthew 13:24 to 30 Jesus talks about a man went forth and sowed good seed in the ground then an enemy came later and SED other seed and he SED tears they all came up together and this is what the vision is showing brother bam this thing that the parable that Jesus told the Kingdom of Heaven is like this and Jesus goes to explain it that the good seed are the children children are the seed of the son of man the children of God but those are the other seed the seed of the wicked amen they'll grow up together amen and they're not to be torn apart from one another but in the end time he'll send laborers workers into the field and they'll be separated how will they be separated they'll be separated by the word so there are two different seeds that are swn into the Earth so then he goes now I knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable the sewer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the S and white was the Lord the so and black was the devil the word was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment water and Sun both prayed both received help from God for he maketh his son and Reign to fall on the both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same Wonder wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed this is it friends they they they both partook of the Sun and Rain he make the Sun and Rain to fall on both good and evil just and unjust and they they both had the same wonderful blessings and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was one great difference they were of different seed now let's go to Matthew chapter 7 Matthew 7 verse 21 Matthew chap 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven now stop right there what is the will of the Father the word he that follows all the word what's the Holy Ghost to do to lead and guide us into all truth the Holy Ghost will keep the word will lead us to the word will never reject the word and never lead us away from the word amen so here we see a great difference right here not everyone that sayith Lord Lord shall enter into so not everybody that claims Jesus Christ as Lord but those that keep the word that doeth the will of the father they're the ones that's going to enter in many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name do many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity iniquity is knowing to do good and not doing it who is he rejected those that work iniquity who is received those that do the will of the father or keep the word it still comes down to the word friends so they said we have not have we not prophesied in thy name they're talking to the King of Kings they're not standing at the white Throne judgment and lying yeah Jesus never denies that they did these wonderful Works they prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works he never denied it I don't believe they're standing there making it up or lying at the white Throne judgment when all the thoughts of men are made known amen this is not they're not lying they truly did those things and I believe they did amen but brother in the church age book said here also was the answer to Matthew 7:21-23 he says it's just after what we read he says Jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by by way of men I'm going to read that again Jesus did not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by way of men even Jesus told them in that day he said if Satan cast out Satan won't he be defeated it's not the work of Satan that cast out these Spirits it's the work of God this is where it gets confusing unless we have a prophet amen Jesus did not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by a way of wi you can see men doing the works that only the Holy Ghost can do only by the power of God can these things be done Satan is not again divided against Satan Satan is not casting out Satan it's the power of the Holy Ghost working the works and if we don't have good grounded teaching that we don't understand what's happening we think well that's a Christian that's a man of God that's a a Son of God that does not mean that that's a Son of God that does not mean that that's a a child of God Amen that's what we see in Matthew 7 yeah Jesus does not deny that they and they weren't doing these things in the name of the devil or the name of a church they they says did we not do these cast out devil that prophesy in thy name they were doing in the name of Jesus Christ so Jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by way of men but he did deny that he ever knew them these weren't backsliders these were Wicked unregenerate reprobates these were the seed of Satan I'm so glad I can read the prophet he can say things that I don't have the authority to say in the message of leadership he says the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell I hope this doesn't confuse you because I've been talking about the baptism Holy Ghost quicking the seed but now we're going to show more in depth we're going to get a good clear picture of this of this teaching you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right look here you are an outside person you have five senses that contacts the outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home seed taste feel smell and here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets conscience and love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with but with your spirit your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contacts the spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from God what's brother benam telling us he's telling us that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be immersed in the Holy Ghost but the immersion of the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken a seed on the inside but if there's no seed on the inside you can still be immersed the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that immersion will not bring a new birth because there's nothing inside to Quicken but it's not that it's not an immersion it's an a baptism of the Holy Ghost it's an immersion in the Holy Ghost but it's not an immersion that brings a new birth that's why he said if you have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth brings the fullness of Christ inside and seals you because it brings to life the seed that's laying there but if there's no seed there you can still be immersed you're submerged in the Holy Ghost and have manifestations and Gifts the gifts and callings of God are without repentance amen it doesn't you don't even have to be born again to manifest those gifts you can manifest those gifts and if they're laying in you amen the immersion of the Holy Gift can bring out the gifts and they can begin to operate and operate correctly and operate spoton that's still no evidence you're born again you're only born again when the predestinate C Gene of God comes to life by the immersion of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth and the evidence is you're changed amen and the evidence is you take all the word all the way and you never leave it it's why it can be so deceiving coming out of a Pentecostal Revival and having those thoughts mixed in amen we have to have the true understanding there's nothing wrong with the gifts the gifts are perfect the gifts are good the gifts are meant to be here they still need to be in operation not a thing wrong with them nothing wrong with Sensations and experiences we want those and we want more of them amen but we have to know what the new birth actually is because you can have Sensations in meetings you can get excited you can get enthused you can even have manifestations but unless something inside of you is quickened to life youve not been born again he goes on to saying trying to do God a service without it being God's will the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark as pitch where would we be friends without a prophet that's why on these subjects I want the prophet to show us the way not our tradition not our ideas not our preferences let the prophet teach us the truth of this age the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is dark as pitch the cerber grows on the same water that builds puts life into the wheat puts life into the Cocker but at the bottom of the Cocker it's a cckar life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of its cocko bur false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can my but it can't stay with the word right let's go to Matthew 24 Matthew 24:24 this is the scripture that brother Brenham preaches anointed ones at the end time from Matthew 24:24 he says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect in the message anointed ones at the end time he says what were they Christ Christ and he spells it out c r i STS is Anointed Christ and false prophets anointed ones but false prophets Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a purpose on a person and yet they are false now listen close and see what he said and they shall show signs and wonders in so much that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible and they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit I know this sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and explain it by the word that that's absolutely thus saith the Lord the truth again in anointed ones at the end time he says the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save Souls that gives them power to perform Miracles it falls on the the unjust the same as the just the very same Spirit now you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 24:24 he said there shall rise there shall rise false Christ false anointed ones Anointed with the genuine thing but be false Propet prophets of it false teachers of it amen it always comes down to the word test not not the spiritual manifest ation test but when it comes down to it it always comes down to the word test does it stay true to the word that's been delivered in this age amen will it accept the word that's been restored through a prophetic ministry will it accept it and yield to it and submit to it and allow this word to be its absolute amen it comes down to the word test and the Rapture he says but when it comes but when it comes to Oh Glory I got the anointing and it's the genuine anointing remember Caiaphas had it too and prophesied so did balam have it and prophesied brother benam said bam had the same Spirit on him that Moses had on him right but that don't have nothing to do with this inside unless that was God's seed he's Gene his Gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished amen I don't care how much you shout speak with tongues run shout that has nothing to do with with it a Cocker can count just as much as any rest of them I've seen heathens raise and shout and speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil any of them Sensations and things forget it it's your heart in that word and that's Christ bring in there and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the age that it's living in amen what will it do that seed Gene of God that's placed in US amen that soul of God Amen it is pre predestinated for this end time hour meaning it's got to come in contact with the end time word because it is a match for the end time word those two come together then what does it do it opens itself up and begins to Bear the fruit what kind of fruit amen the fruit of the intime word amen so now you can see the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope I can say a few things now amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is like water baptism you can go down a dry Center and come up a wet Center and be fully immersed in the water according to the word amen amen but if there's no repentance and conversion in the heart there's no repentance you just go down and come back the same condition the immersion in the Holy Ghost can be exactly the same way yeah and it can bring manifestations and Sensations and mighty works and prophesying and tongues and interpretations and anything that's available to any True Believer and any true gift and any true experience it can bring all of that and it's that immersion will immerse you in the Holy Ghost and you'll be immersed in the Holy Ghost a sinner a wrong seed and you'll remain a sinner a wrong seed but for the genuine child of God predestinated by God that immersion in the spirit of God whether it has sensation or not listen that immersion can have all kinds of Sensations but it's amazing when the Holy Ghost will fall in a tangible way amongst the meeting it affects everybody some people get nervous and leave some people weep some people come to the altar some people it has all kinds of effects but not all of those effects are permanent effects right because it only affects the spiritual realm but on some it'll have a permanent effect and and though it's the same power of God falling there'll be many different reactions many different Sensations but the thing that we're looking for more than anything is that being submerged in his spirit will allow the spirit to penetrate and come in contact with the seed remember that seed is your soul it's in the soul and that seed in the soul is in the realm that has no sensation all of your Sensations are in the outer two Realms but the contact that brings the New Birth has no sensation in that realm it only has two things Faith or unbelief it doesn't have feelings it doesn't have emotion it doesn't have any of that so that's why when you're immersed you can have all kinds of feelings and emotions that's the second realm thing but the realm that's coming to the New Birth the contact in the seed is in the realm that has no sensation that's why you can have a new birth without sensation or it can accompany lots of Sensations but those Sensations many times is your spirit realm reacting to the presence of God Amen but the real birth is coming with without sensation just like the conception in Mary Mary had no sensation but the spirit amen brought forth a product in her wound without sensation so it can come with sensation and that's why brother bam said one of the Mysteries in this end time is the New Birth without the baptism the Holy Ghost a new birth without sensation it because it doesn't require a sensation although I say many times it may have a sensation cuz it's hard not to react in the spirit realm into the presence of God it can be dynamic and Powerful it can be subtle it can be like a light Breeze it can be like power falling upon you it affects all of us in a different way it could be so subtle that you didn't really recogn like you knew something happened but you didn't recognize that that was the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what is it it's an immersion in the spirit yeah and that immersion is to bring contact with the light life of the word to the word in you and bring it to life that's the new birth that's why it's a seal now in the questions and answers on the Holy Ghost brother B preached the Holy Ghost Series in 1959 that I really enjoyed studying but he says this and now God is in US Jesus said in John 14 in the day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me God in us what was the purpose now we know God's in us we've been born again we've been quickened to life what's the purpose he says to carry out his plan what's the purpose of all of this why did I have a new birth why did I to carry out his plan not so I can for 20 years give a testimony of my new birth experience no my new birth experience amen was to put me in position to carry out the plan and will of God Amen am let's go to Acts chapter 1 I'm going to go a little bit longer if you can just hang with me I know it's Wednesday night and I know many people haven't been feeling good but praise be to God Amen I love the word of God it dissolves all doubt it ends all dispute it settles the questions it establishes is in the word of God unshakable and unmovable these are the things that we need to know we've been tossed here by preaching and tossed here by preaching in our traditional ideas and what we carried into the message but by the grace of God he's given us a firm foundation in the word of God Amen Acts 1:8 Jesus still speaking to the disciples after his resurrection he says but ye shall receive power oh praise God we want that power but we want to know what that power is to do I hear so many I I grew up in Pentecost we talked about the power you need the power the power and it was always the power to do a manifestation power to do a work power for raising the dead and all of that's Incorporated but what is this power supposed to do it's supposed to accomplish God's purpose he said but you shall also receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and into the uttermost parts of the earth what is that power to do it's the power to make you a witness of [Music] him that's what the power of the Holy Ghost is supposed to do make us a witness of him to accomplish his purpose he says in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for from 1959 if you feel the least tug don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what is it for to continue his work among his people listen now he's going to he's going to keep carrying this on to the end now watch this what's the what is the Holy Ghost God in you what is it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this day far beyond the Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal un a place to an adoption and a rapturing Grace amen what's this Holy Ghost is God in you what's it supposed to do to continue the work all the way to adoption and the rapturing grace that when this church this and when this part of the church the one we have right now when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church here it'll raise oh praise God the power of God has raised us out of dark denominationalism brought us into darkness into light we've raised out of denomination raised out of out of Le Dean condition raised in the newness of life this church is raised by the power of God and it's got further more to raise when this church here it'll raise let's let's read this when the spirit moves into this church here it'll raise it'll just raise and it'll bring forth bring forth all of the redeemed that's touched that Spirit what is the spirit supposed to do in this age of this church supposed to go far beyond what the Lutheran far beyond what the methodists far Bey what the Pentecost but bring us to an adoption and to a rapturing Grace that'll actually raise the church and she goes goes up word by word and she goes all the way up until it actually brings with it the redeemed from all from the last 2,000 years that has touched that Spirit that's what the Holy Ghost was given for that's what it's supposed to be doing praise God it's an immersion it's an immersion friends it's an immersion that's supposed to to do something it's an immersion a dip a a a submerging in the very presence of God that quickens a predestinated seed to life am amen that changes us from what we were to Sons and Daughters of God Amen Born Again by the spirit of God seals us into the day of redemption and leads and guides us into all truth truth to accomplish his purpose and to keep fulfilling his word that's what it's for that's why it comes but you know it takes an immersion of baptism in the Holy Spirit to bring the quickening power to the seed to bring us to life and we notice as we looked as we preached as we talked we know that other individuals can be immersed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but yet there's no seed there to Quicken but it's still an immersion a true immersion a true baptism in the Holy Ghost and it can have all kinds of manifestations and signs so there is an immersion that even non-elect can go through but I would like to end by just sharing this if the baptism of the Holy Ghost is an immersion or a dipping or submerging in the spirit of God I don't want just one I don't want just one we all have to have one to bring a new birth but I don't want just one and if a non-elect can have a baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe I can have more than one immersion in the spirit of God I can have more than one time in my life amen that the presence of God envelops me amen and immerses me completely in his presence and I want more brother bandam goes on to say in 1953 the me message the resurrection says what we need today is another refilling a filling another like the disciples some of you try to test an experience or trust it that they had 10 years ago that's all right but what about today you need one today today is the day sure a filling the disciples about 3 or 4 days after they received the Holy Ghost went back and got in one Accord and began to pray again with one Accord until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sitting amen that's what we need I want to look at this in Acts if you can come with me to Acts chapter 4 now in Acts chapter 2 we see on the day of Pentecost was full come in that that they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what did the baptism of the Holy Ghost do to them it sent them out onto the street and immediately they begin to preach the word to be a witness of Jesus Christ so then we go to Acts chapter 4 4 and then Acts chapter 3 we see Peter and John go to the temple to worship and they as they go through the gate beautiful they come by a lame man and the lame man amen he was lame from his birth and and they begin to tell him you know gold and silver have i n but such as I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and he went running and leaping into the temple and everybody begin to praise him and this concerned the temple guards and and the elders and they arrested them and they brought them in chapter 4 and in chapter 4 they bring him to arrest them they let him sit all night in jail they bring him to the council the next day amen and let's pick it up at verse 6 John chapter 4: 6 and Annis the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander And as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Holy Ghost all right listen Peter had been filled with the Holy Ghost a few days before in the upper room but we find Peter when he stands up he was filled with the Holy Ghost to do what to be a witness what did he do after he had the experience in the upper room was quickened alive sealed by the spirit full of the Holy Ghost he went out and then they had a great manifestation where everybody from all these nations heard them speaking in their own language it was a sign it got their attention when God got their attention and they they gathered around what was the next thing that happened P Peter filled with the Holy Ghost stood up and said there these men are not drunk as you suppose amen but this is that which the prophet Joel said this is the day this is the hour this is your sign amen what was he doing he was preaching the word with boldness why he had received power to be a witness before that he was hiding now they go to the temple they work another notable Miracle amen it didn't say he was filled with the Holy Ghost when he worked a miracle but it said he being filled with the Holy Ghost gave an answer because that's what the power of the Holy Ghost was given for to be a witness and he says let's continue here verse eight then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel by by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him did this man stand here before you whole that's the power of the Holy Ghost in demonstration in a person's life he's not ashamed of the Gospel he's not afraid to give witness in the face of persecution standing in the council later they threaten him and he says is it you tell me is it better to obey God or man why cuz he was filled with the Holy Ghost now we find that they released them threatening finding no nothing else that they could do to them they run back to the company of the Saints they gather in with the Believers and they begin to tell them all that befell them and all that had happened to them and what was said to them and how they answered and and they they gave all this they gave all of these answers and I want to pick this up I I want to read it a little earlier when I was planning to let's pick it up in verse 23 let's read the whole thing in context acts 4 ver 23 and being let go they went to their company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that is in that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against the holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed hath Herod and pontious pilate and the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak the word so look what the request is God help us that with all boldness we can speak your word that's the request by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who was there Peter and John and many of those that had already received the baptism of the Holy Ghost once again amen when they prayed for boldness to speak the word and that God would stretch forth his hands with signs and wonders so that they can preach the gospel amen all of a sudden the power came and shook the room and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who was filled with the Holy Ghost those that had already been filled with the Holy Ghost that means you can be immersed again friends you can have another immersion another filling of the Holy Ghost and I say God I want another one and another one and another one because I want power to speak the word with boldness I don't want to be ashamed I don't want to be afraid I don't want to have to use my own mind I need another power in me beyond my power to make me a witness fill me again oh God let your power Fall once more on us Lord fill us with your spirit fill us again and again may I never grow weary of having to be immersed in the presence of God may I never get so dry amen that I don't come back into his presence say God bring a freshening bring a refilling amen keep the moisture flowing all over me that I can grow and bear fruit and finish the work that you set out for this day keep me in the power to be your witness I don't want to rely I sure I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost absolutely I was quickened by that sealed by that I believe I had the new birth I I know the experience changed me I know what happened to me but that's not enough amen if the disciples just a few days after wanted more power more boldness I want more as well and if they could have a refilling I can have a refilling if a non-elect can be immersed in the spirit I can be immersed again and again and again that's what I want I want an immersion in the Holy Ghost I need we all need one for a new birth but we all need more than just one to be a WI witness brother man said what was the Holy Ghost given for in the same message what was the Holy Ghost given for now how many wants to receive the Holy Ghost take examination of Our Lives how many hasn't received it and wants to ra raise up your hand say brother brandom with the depths of my heart I want to receive the Holy Ghost God bless you everywhere and how many of you that has received it and would like to go like they did in

Holy Ghost series and on those that receive the Holy Ghost amen but he's saying how many of you received it but you want what they had an acts for you want God to give you more boldness more power be a greater wit said oh God fill me again dip me in your spirit submerge me in your spirit fill every fiber of my being All of Me Lord Body Soul and Spirit Let It Be immersed into your presence oh God Amen oh praise be to God brother Bram says also we pray today that your spirit will be poured out AR fresh upon us give us a fresh baptism this morning Lord or a fresh filling oh if the prophet of God could want it if he could preach it that means it's available friend I don't care how long you serve the Lord I don't know how much how care how much he's done for you in the past amen we haven't reached our Peak yet amen we haven't come to the Pinnacle yet there's more work to be done there's more adoption to be done there's more en rapturing Grace to be realized there's more we can have more we can do more we can speak more we can preach more we can demonstrate more but what do we need we need another immersion in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need another dipping in the spirit of God we need it again and again and again let it never grow old and let us never get tired of seeking God for more brother R says in the message why Christ speak he says one thing that the Tabernacle needs of there at our church at the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a a refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church to be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling hey I'm willing to confess to you I need a refilling I need one bad I need a freshening of my experience I I need I need that experience of God enveloping me again and again and pouring his Spirit out upon me I'm not what I was amen I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be I'm but I I'm not what I ought to be so I know that there's got to be more to take me to what I ought to be I want to be his witness at home I want to be his witness at work I want to be his witness in my conduct my conversation my dress my attitudes I want to be his I want with my wife with my children with my co-workers I want to be his witness I want to have boldness not just to speak but to let my life speak not to pull back amen but to step forward and let my light so shine that the others see my good works and glorify my father that's in heaven God that I could pray for the sick at work stretch forth thy hand to heal in the name of thy holy Child Jesus it's not wrong to ask for that God show yourself demonstrate so that we have a voice demonstrate all through the book of Acts there was a demonstration of the power of God to what to give them a pedestal to preach from how many times do we turn in prayer requests for co-workers for family members for neighbors and how many times does God heal them if you watch if you pay attention it's the neighbor gets healed the coworker gets healed the friend from work gets healed this associate and this cooworker and this fellow student of mine what's God doing he's stretching forth his hand to heal why so that we can be Witnesses amen God let your power flow through US fill us Lord again and again and again I don't know about you but I'm hungry thirsty for more oh he's done so much I'm not complaining it's not that he's ever failed it's not that he hasn't been so good it doesn't that it's not that he has hasn't given experience upon experience upon experience this is why some people struggle with the baptism Holy Ghost they've had experiences with God and every time they have another experience they say well maybe now this is it no your first experience when you were tank that was it but that's not the only time you're going to be baptized in the Holy Ghost you're going to have it again and again and again don't keep starting over let the first be the first but seek more don't let the devil tell you well now this is it that way no when God turned your heart to him that was it amen when God changed you when you were born again that was it let that stay settled amen but then say God I want another experience and another experience and while you're falling on others don't pass me by when you're falling in an atmosphere when you're falling in a service when you're falling to bring New Birth bring a refreshing to me the same time you're bringing a new birth to my neighbor amen under the power of the preaching of the Gospel is the Holy Ghost falling upon you receive it in the name of Jesus Christ don't just sit there and say that's good preaching no it is brother Bram said when a man of God is preaching the word of God he's holding the Holy Ghost out over the people now you receive it just reach up and say God that's for me I'm receiving it in the name of Jesus Christ you receive the Holy Ghost you don't just stand there and say oh the the God will fill me when he was no you receive the Holy Ghost open your heart and say God on Wash Me All of Me fill me all of me I don't want any more of myself but I want more of you oh praise be to God I want more I want more I believe there's more there's more for this church to do there's more God's got more for us to do to finish his purpose on this Earth he left a portion of his work undone he didn't do it all in his Earthly Ministry but he left a portion to be done in and through the bride I say oh God send your power upon us to finish your work stretch forth thy hand in healing and mighty works in the name of thy precious holy Child Lord Jesus and give us boldness to speak your word amen let's all stand together oh praise be to God I'm hungry for more you know you know what you can't be hungry unless there's something to fill that hunger you can't desire what's not available remember the brother Brenham said about the little boy they found him eating the eating eracers in school and eating the pedals off his bicycles what did he need he need the sulfur that was in the rubber there was a deep calling to the Deep oh there's a deep calling in me for another filling of the Holy Ghost there's got to be a deep to respond to this I couldn't want it if it's not available I couldn't be hungry for it and brother B said you can't crave it unless it's there amen you can't have a craving you can't crave of food unless there's a food to meet that craving amen and we've got a craving in our hearts I got a craving in my heart for another filling of the Holy Ghost for a freshening of my experience and I couldn't have this craving unless there's something somewhere to meet this craving amen let's bow our heads friend and I encourage you just receive what you want receive it Lord Jesus I I raised my hands to you Lord as the prophet did so long ago when he said who's had this filling of the Holy Ghost this baptism and wants a refilling God I raised my hands I want a refilling Lord let your power Fall upon me God that you might do your work through this flesh God I can do nothing without you you are the vine and we are the branches the life has to come from you Lord and without you we can do nothing but oh with you all things are possible Lord
