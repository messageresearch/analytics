[0:00] Oh, how I wish I had time to go back
[0:02] into Ezekiel. What? Now, where does he
[0:05] want to go? He does all this and now he
[0:06] wants to go to Ezekiel and pull out them
[0:08] dry bones and show you. He said, "Can
[0:10] these bones live again?" He said,
[0:12] "Prophesy." Said, "How can prophecy
[0:14] come?" Only through the prophet.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord. Hear ye dry
[0:19] bones, the word of the Lord. And send
[0:21] you skin came upon them and they stood
[0:23] up a mighty army and began to march
[0:25] towards Zion. Glory to God. Listen.
[0:28] Glory to God. Oh, praise God. That's
[0:31] him. That's him. The victory.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; What's him? Can these dry bones live?
[0:38] What dry bones? It's the army of the
[0:41] Lord. It's the church that went down
[0:43] through four stages of the insect that
[0:45] ate it down to nothing but began to come
[0:48] back through three stages. Senu listen
[0:50] he brother Bam breaks this all down in
[0:52] the message. He comes back in these dry
[0:54] rooms. Senue came bone came to bone. sin
[0:57] you came skin come upon it and it's
[0:59] standing back a mighty army and it says
[1:01] then it calls for the wind to come which
[1:03] is what is the wind is the original life
[1:06] the breath of God the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:09] and the latter rain and the and the
[1:11] third pull amen the Holy Ghost came back
[1:14] into this body his body his bride body
[1:17] to bring him back to life and then what
[1:19] does he say then she's marching on to
[1:22] Zion oh praise God what is Zion it's the
[1:25] bride what happened somewhere along the
[1:28] line. This but this this army never made
[1:32] it all the way to Zion to the marriage
[1:34] of the lamb. But praise God, there's
[1:36] going to be a restoration. Not a new
[1:38] army, but a restoration of the original
[1:40] army, which was the church that came out
[1:42] of Pentecost.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it back. He
[1:45] says, "Prophesy." How are you going to
[1:47] prophesy? Only through a prophet. It's
[1:50] only a prophet that can bring this body
[1:53] of the bride back to life. the army of
[1:56] the Lord. And what's this army going to
[1:57] do when it comes to life? Finish the
[2:00] journey. The first age didn't finish.
[2:02] She's going all the way to Zion. She's
[2:04] going to enter into Bula land. She's
[2:06] going to be married to the lamb.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about,
[2:12] friends.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is about.
[2:14] That's what the vindication is about.
[2:16] That's why you're here. And that's why
[2:18] your soul is jumping and a shouting and
[2:20] a stirring because this is you. This
[2:22] isn't a doctrine. This is you. This
[2:24] isn't a teaching. This is you. This is
[2:26] the purpose you were born for. This is
[2:28] the attribute that's inside of you that
[2:30] was back in God's mind when he was alone
[2:32] with his attributes, thinking of himself
[2:34] becoming flesh. That's what's inside of
[2:36] you. Can't contain itself anymore
[2:38] because it's him coming to the
[2:40] manifestation of this prophecy.
[2:44] And he's coming in his glory. He's
[2:47] taking what was defiled, what was
[2:49] broken, what was cast down, and what was
[2:51] utterly useless. And by his blood and by
[2:54] his spirit and by his work, he's
[2:56] restoring the masterpiece again. And it
[2:59] glorifies him,
[3:02] &gt;&gt; not her,
[3:03] &gt;&gt; him.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Because the woman is the glory of the
[3:07] manise.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we've got to be under hers.
[3:11] That's why we don't take denomination.
[3:12] That's why we don't seek sign. That's
[3:14] why the only thing for us is the
[3:15] original word.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; To be pregnant by the word, to manifest
[3:19] the word, to become the word. Amen.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; That's the whole
