[3:27] gift of
[3:28] bringing i i say he has a gift of just

[3:43] a whole lot more to this than what i've

[3:52] dwayne lawson and he's actually going to
[3:53] be home this week

[5:02] verse 10 and verse 11
[5:06] i will greatly rejoice in the lord my
[5:08] soul shall be joyful in my
[5:10] god for he hath clothed me with the
[5:11] garments of salvation
[5:13] he hath covered me with the robe of
[5:15] righteousness
[5:16] as a bridegroom decath himself with
[5:18] ornaments and as a bride adorneth
[5:20] herself with jewels
[5:22] amen let's read that again i will
[5:25] greatly rejoice in the lord my soul
[5:27] shall be joyful in my god
[5:29] i will greatly rejoice and my soul shall
[5:31] be joyful why
[5:32] because he hath clothed me in garments
[5:35] of salvation
[5:36] he hath covered me with robes of
[5:39] righteousness
[5:40] what kind of robes what kind of garments
[5:42] as a bridegroom decath himself for
[5:44] ornaments
[5:45] and as a bride adorneth herself with her
[5:47] jewels
[5:48] that's kind that's the kind of covering
[5:50] that we have
[5:52] one that's prepared for the wedding for
[5:54] as the earth bringeth forth her blood
[5:56] and as the garden causes the things that
[5:58] are sown in it
[5:59] to spring forth so the lord god will
[6:01] cause the righteous
[6:03] righteousness and praise to spring forth
[6:05] before all nations
[6:07] let's just pray dear heavenly father we
[6:08] thank you lord for your word
[6:10] god we're so thankful for a place to
[6:12] come and gather and to worship your name
[6:14] lord and
[6:15] we just pray right now lord that you
[6:17] would be the one that had preeminence
[6:18] lord
[6:19] god we haven't come to hear the words of
[6:21] a man we haven't come to hear the
[6:22] thinking of a man
[6:24] that's all pointless lord it's all
[6:25] vanity but we've come to hear from you
[6:27] god
[6:28] and we know that you've chosen a method
[6:30] to deliver your mind deliver your word
[6:32] and that's through the foolishness of
[6:33] preaching
[6:34] so we all right now this morning submit
[6:36] ourselves to that method that you've
[6:38] laid out in your word lord i submit
[6:40] myself to that as a vessel that you can
[6:42] use i pray god that i could just lay
[6:44] my thoughts to the side lord and that
[6:46] you would just use these lips of clay
[6:48] to speak eternal life to your children
[6:51] we ask that you'd be with us in every
[6:52] part of the service
[6:53] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[6:56] can all be seated
[6:59] amen this morning i want to
[7:02] i want to preach on the rise of the
[7:05] queen
[7:07] the rise of the queen as a subject and
[7:09] i'm going to have to break this down
[7:10] into a couple parts
[7:11] so the first part i just chose a
[7:13] subtitle of choosing a bride
[7:15] so the rise of a queen we're going to
[7:17] start with choosing a bride
[7:19] now brother branham said something in
[7:21] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[7:23] and i've read it here before but i
[7:24] thought it'd be good to go over again
[7:27] he said god's great mystery of how it's
[7:29] a secret he kept it a secret
[7:32] nobody knows nothing about it even the
[7:34] angels didn't understand it see
[7:36] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[7:38] under our seventh mystery when the
[7:39] seventh seal was open
[7:41] there was silence jesus when he was on
[7:43] the earth they wanted to know when he
[7:45] would come he said
[7:46] it's not even him the son himself don't
[7:48] know when it's going to happen see
[7:50] god has this all to himself it's a
[7:52] secret and that's the reason there was
[7:54] silence in heaven
[7:55] for the space of half an hour and seven
[7:58] thunders uttered their voices and john
[7:59] was even forbidden to write it see
[8:01] the coming of the lord so he's talking
[8:03] about this great secret and we went
[8:05] through this here
[8:06] the great secret was the coming of the
[8:07] lord it was the seventh seal
[8:09] and it was in a mystery form and that's
[8:10] what he's going to preach about here and
[8:12] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[8:14] but the next thing is what i want us to
[8:15] catch that's the one thing he hasn't
[8:17] revealed yet
[8:18] of how he will come and when he will
[8:20] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[8:22] no
[8:22] he has showed it or revealed it in every
[8:25] type that's in the bible
[8:27] have we been seeing that amen that's
[8:30] what i want to look at again because i
[8:31] want to go through the story of esther
[8:33] this morning he has showed or revealed
[8:35] it in every type that's in the bible
[8:37] therefore the entire bible is the
[8:39] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[8:42] the entire bible is an expression of one
[8:44] goal that god had
[8:45] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[8:47] entire bible and
[8:48] all the acts of the believers in the
[8:50] bible has been in type
[8:51] and expressing what god's great goal is
[8:54] and now
[8:55] in this last day he has revealed it
[8:58] and shows it now in these last days he
[9:02] will reveal it and that's not what the
[9:03] prophet said
[9:04] now in these last days he has revealed
[9:07] it and
[9:08] shows it and he's continuing to show it
[9:12] amen so we know that when we read the
[9:14] bible now
[9:16] the prophet of god told us we don't read
[9:17] the bible like we read a newspaper
[9:19] it's a love letter right when you read a
[9:22] love letter you read a love letter from
[9:23] somebody you have an
[9:24] intimate knowledge about and somebody
[9:26] that that you're in an intimate
[9:27] relationship with
[9:29] right now in in that kind of love letter
[9:32] i can pick up this love letter that
[9:34] somebody wrote to somebody else
[9:36] all right all right say girl wrote to
[9:39] boy this love letter so i pick up the
[9:40] love letter
[9:41] and most of it's going to be nonsense to
[9:43] me it's going to turn my stomach for the
[9:45] first
[9:46] first part i'm not going to enjoy it
[9:47] because nobody likes reading love
[9:49] letters that belong to somebody else
[9:50] it's nauseating
[9:52] but when it's your love letter oh my
[9:54] goodness
[9:55] we'll save it in a shoe box we'll put it
[9:57] on a thing we'll be 80 years old and
[9:59] we'll pull it back out and
[10:00] and and the perfume will still come off
[10:03] the love letter right
[10:04] because why it's your letter it's
[10:07] addressed to you
[10:09] so i can pick up somebody else's letter
[10:11] and read it and most of it's not going
[10:12] to make any sense to me because i
[10:14] haven't experienced these things with
[10:16] this person
[10:16] i don't know what they're referring to i
[10:18] don't know what those little secret
[10:20] messages are or what the in-between the
[10:22] line reading is
[10:24] amen but to the one who wrote it and to
[10:28] the one who's reading it
[10:29] they get it in this bible is a love
[10:32] letter
[10:33] written to the bride of jesus christ and
[10:36] a lot of people will read that and
[10:37] they'll either nauseate them or they
[10:38] won't have a clue what it's talking
[10:40] about
[10:40] but the bride it's for her she knows
[10:42] what it is and when she reads it
[10:44] she still gets twitter painted just the
[10:46] same as day one
[10:50] right amen it gets more real
[10:54] and it gets more vivid and it becomes
[10:56] more alive
[10:57] the more we read this because we're
[10:58] reading it by revelation
[11:01] and the revelation of the mystery is
[11:02] getting richer and richer
[11:04] and richer amen
[11:08] so i want to take a look at esther let's
[11:10] all of us turn together to the book of
[11:11] esther
[11:12] and i just want to pull a little bit out
[11:14] of esther
[11:15] on this rise of a queen we're all pretty
[11:18] familiar with this story
[11:20] and so there's a lot of types and
[11:24] shadows
[11:25] in the book of esther
[11:31] it's amazing for all the time that
[11:36] that people feel like there's a lot of
[11:38] people in the world condition today
[11:40] because
[11:40] we're in a world especially in the
[11:41] western hemisphere especially in western
[11:44] society
[11:45] that that believes the old ways are
[11:48] wrong and the new ways are better and
[11:50] and things from way back where our cake
[11:52] or medieval or
[11:53] in that in that the bible is part of
[11:56] that uh
[11:57] and some of the cause of that and they
[11:59] believe that the bible is hard on women
[12:01] and they believe the bible doesn't give
[12:02] equal rights and all this other stuff
[12:04] and they don't realize the bible talks
[12:06] about women all the time
[12:08] you've got esther and you've got ruth
[12:10] and you've got all these stories in the
[12:13] bible
[12:13] they just don't understand how special
[12:15] the woman type is in scripture
[12:17] she's not oppressed she's not pushed
[12:19] down amen the woman type is actually
[12:21] beautiful
[12:22] when you read it in scripture and
[12:23] understand it's always a type of the
[12:25] bride
[12:26] and when you catch that vision the bible
[12:28] talks a lot about women
[12:30] the bible promotes women the bible puts
[12:33] women in the right place
[12:34] because it's a beautiful position the
[12:37] problem is the modern thinking doesn't
[12:38] want a woman in that position she wants
[12:40] a woman
[12:41] in a different position and because the
[12:43] bible doesn't speak that way
[12:45] they think the bible's wrong but the
[12:48] bible's not wrong
[12:50] so let's go back here and look at the
[12:51] book of esther esther chapter one verse
[12:54] one and i want you to pay close
[12:56] attention to the revelation of the
[12:57] seventh seal
[12:59] amen all right what was the revelation
[13:03] of the seventh seal
[13:05] in three parts to get preeminence in a
[13:07] man
[13:08] to get preeminence in the bride the
[13:09] church and to restore the kingdom back
[13:12] king and queen
[13:12] back in in eden condition right
[13:16] that's the three parts of the great
[13:18] mystery three
[13:19] parts of the seventh seal amen three
[13:21] parts of the coming of the lord
[13:23] coming in the man coming in the woman
[13:27] man and woman coming together got it
[13:31] we've got king
[13:34] queen king and queen
[13:38] oh it's so simple we'll walk all over it
[13:41] if we don't catch it and see it in the
[13:42] scriptures
[13:43] so we want to take a look at the seventh
[13:45] seal here in the in the book of esther
[13:46] and i want you to pay close attention to
[13:48] the numbers
[13:49] amen because they tell us tell us a
[13:51] story
[13:52] now it came to pass in the days of
[13:54] ahasaros this is the
[13:56] soros which reigned from india even into
[13:58] ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces
[14:03] that in those days when the king azaris
[14:05] sat on the throne of his kingdom which
[14:06] was in shusha and the palace
[14:08] in the third year of his reign right
[14:12] not in the second year of a reign
[14:13] something's going to transition
[14:15] something that that is telling the story
[14:19] of redemption there's a story of
[14:22] redemption that's going to be told here
[14:23] and the story redemption doesn't happen
[14:25] in the second year
[14:26] it doesn't happen in the fifth year it
[14:27] happens in the third year
[14:31] brother branham told us that in the
[14:33] church ages that this church went down
[14:34] into the dark ages
[14:35] but through three stages was restored
[14:37] back
[14:39] jesus says destroy this temple and in
[14:40] three days i'll build it back
[14:42] amen and so now the church temple was
[14:45] destroyed
[14:46] by babylon to the dark ages but there
[14:48] was a remnant came out and rebuilt the
[14:49] temple
[14:50] and in three stages it came back amen
[14:54] so in the third year of this king
[14:58] of his reign he made a feast unto all
[15:00] his princes and his servants the power
[15:02] of persian media
[15:03] the nobles and the princes of the
[15:04] provinces being before him
[15:07] when he showed the riches of his
[15:08] glorious kingdom in the honor of his
[15:10] excellent majesty
[15:11] many days even 104 score days that's 180
[15:15] days
[15:15] and when these days were expired so i
[15:18] want to look at 180 days really quickly
[15:20] just
[15:20] very quickly the the old jewish calendar
[15:23] is 30 days to a month 360 days in a year
[15:26] so 180 days is exactly six months so he
[15:30] did this for six
[15:31] months but after six months when six
[15:34] months were expired
[15:35] now he's going to do something different
[15:37] when is he going to do something
[15:38] different
[15:39] in the seventh month
[15:42] hallelujah when
[15:45] when is the redemption finished in the
[15:47] feast of the lord
[15:48] in the seventh month you have trumpets
[15:51] you have atonement
[15:52] you have tabernacles the last part of
[15:54] redemption is in the seventh month
[15:56] when is atonement in the seventh month
[15:59] how many church ages are there
[16:00] seven it's completion amen so
[16:03] after 180 days he did this for 180 days
[16:07] and when they when these days were
[16:08] expired now we move into the seventh
[16:10] month
[16:11] and in the seventh month the king made a
[16:12] feast unto all the people that were
[16:14] present in shush and the palace
[16:16] both unto great and small seven days
[16:19] my goodness brother brandon said if you
[16:22] missed the numerology in the bible
[16:23] you've missed the bible
[16:25] you go back and read it again this is
[16:28] all three
[16:29] and seven seventh month and seven days
[16:31] and and third year
[16:33] it's all the story of redemption all
[16:36] over again
[16:38] every story is a story of redemption
[16:42] amen seven days in the court of the
[16:46] garden of the king's palace
[16:48] let's jump over to verse 10 on the
[16:50] seventh day
[16:53] not on the sixth day not on the fifth
[16:56] day not on the tenth day
[16:57] but on the seventh day when the heart of
[17:00] the king was married with wine he
[17:02] commanded
[17:03] muhuman vista harbana
[17:06] bigtha abagatha zether
[17:09] and carcus i hate reading names of the
[17:12] old testament
[17:13] especially in front of a crowd because
[17:14] somebody's be like that wasn't right i
[17:16] would have said that differently
[17:19] but we can trade places anytime you want
[17:21] to read names for me
[17:25] all right so he reads off these names
[17:27] the seventh he commanded these seven
[17:29] the seven chamberlains that served in
[17:31] the presence of alhassarus the king
[17:34] now there's a command going to seven
[17:36] chamberlains and chamberlains or eunuchs
[17:38] and eunuchs served in the presence of
[17:40] the king they didn't serve out in the
[17:41] kingdom
[17:42] these were the seven eunuchs that served
[17:43] in the presence of the king now what are
[17:45] eunuchs
[17:46] eunuchs are men that cannot propagate
[17:49] themselves they have no seed
[17:52] all right so they're only there to
[17:54] propagate the king's commandments not
[17:57] their own
[17:58] these are the servants of the king and
[17:59] their eunuchs they have no
[18:01] wife of their own they have no seed of
[18:03] their own they have no children of their
[18:05] own
[18:05] they're there to propagate the king's
[18:08] commandments
[18:10] these are the seven church age
[18:11] messengers the church age messengers
[18:13] weren't sent they come from the presence
[18:15] of the lord but they were not sent
[18:16] the seven spirits that are before the
[18:18] throne right
[18:20] come out in each age they were not sent
[18:23] out they meant to marry their church
[18:26] they were not sent out to propagate
[18:28] themselves they were not sent
[18:30] out to give their own word they were
[18:31] sent out to bring forth the decree of
[18:33] the king
[18:35] amen so these are seven chamberlains
[18:39] before the king to bring what is the
[18:43] purpose
[18:44] to bring vashti the queen before the
[18:47] king
[18:48] with the crown royal for to show the
[18:50] people and the princess her beauty for
[18:52] she was fair
[18:53] to look upon amen
[18:58] but vashti but the queen vashti refused
[19:01] to come at the king's commandment by his
[19:03] chamberlain's
[19:04] therefore was the king very roth and his
[19:06] anger
[19:07] burned in him
[19:12] now you notice when it was time for the
[19:14] queen to be presented on the seventh day
[19:18] it was time the king sent out a decree
[19:21] by seven
[19:22] chamberlains so it wasn't the king
[19:26] that went to the queen it was the
[19:28] chamberlain's that went to the queen
[19:31] with the king's message
[19:36] and vashti refused who
[19:40] the chamberlain's which means she
[19:43] refused
[19:44] the king to refuse the chamberlains is
[19:49] to refuse the king
[19:51] to refuse to seven church age messengers
[19:54] is to refuse the king
[19:58] amen he showed it in every type and
[20:01] shadow that's in the bible
[20:04] the same story over and over and over
[20:07] again
[20:08] once your eyes are opened they're open
[20:11] you can't close them again
[20:13] hallelujah what was vashti doing this
[20:16] whole time
[20:18] go to verse nine go up to verse nine
[20:21] also vasti the queen made a feast for
[20:23] the women
[20:25] in the royal house which belonged to
[20:27] king azaris
[20:29] now here is this mighty queen and this
[20:32] mighty queen has decided to take upon
[20:33] herself
[20:34] to have a feast while the king's having
[20:36] his feast while things are going on for
[20:38] six months
[20:38] into the seventh month she's doing her
[20:41] own little work over here on the side
[20:43] and she's having a feast with the women
[20:46] or with the churches
[20:49] now she decides to have an ecumenical
[20:51] council now she brings in vatican ii
[20:55] amen are we paying attention
[21:00] so now this queen is supposed to be the
[21:03] queen
[21:03] now she's having the feast with women
[21:07] that's why denomination is is
[21:09] homosexuality
[21:11] because it's churches dominating
[21:13] churches women dominating women they
[21:15] have no
[21:16] seed no propagation amen you only get
[21:19] that from the king
[21:21] amen that's why you can't be born again
[21:25] by connecting to the eunuch
[21:28] you can't be born again by marrying the
[21:30] messenger
[21:31] only by connecting to the king
[21:35] because the eunuch doesn't have seed but
[21:38] the king does
[21:40] amen so now vashti's having her little
[21:45] banquet
[21:46] with the women now the king sends the
[21:48] seven chamberlains the seven messengers
[21:50] the seven church age messengers
[21:52] over and she refuses
[21:57] the king is not happy
[22:02] but look at the response of the king
[22:07] but the queen in verse 12 refused
[22:10] to come at the king's commandment by his
[22:14] chamberlains
[22:18] how does she refuse the king by
[22:22] his chamberlains how did the command of
[22:25] the king come
[22:26] by his chamberlains
[22:30] and when she refused to heed the call of
[22:33] the chamberlains
[22:34] she refused the king
[22:41] therefore was the king very
[22:45] wroth and his anger burned
[22:49] in him don't think that you're going to
[22:52] refuse him this day
[22:53] and not face judgment amen
[22:57] it didn't work in that in this day in
[22:59] the book of esther
[23:00] and it's certainly not going to work in
[23:01] this day when god
[23:03] when god has sent back all seven spirits
[23:05] and seven thunders in the last day
[23:07] and revealed the whole thing in a mighty
[23:09] way and basically
[23:10] he sent all seven chamberlains in this
[23:13] day
[23:15] the full message the full revelation all
[23:17] seven thundering out in consecutive
[23:19] order
[23:21] and all seven have come to bid the queen
[23:23] to come
[23:24] and she refused and don't think that
[23:27] you're gonna refuse today
[23:29] and expect anything different whatsoever
[23:31] because grace is found
[23:33] in listening to the chamberlains grace
[23:36] is found in the commandment of the king
[23:38] not in doing whatever so ever we think
[23:40] we want to do
[23:42] now now the word vashti means
[23:45] beautiful the actual interpretation of
[23:48] vashti is beautiful
[23:49] and i want you to turn with me the
[23:51] revelations chapter 17.
[23:54] we're going to find vashti in the
[24:02] scriptures
[24:05] revelation 17 starting at verse 3
[24:08] so he carried me away in the spirit in
[24:10] the wilderness and i saw a woman
[24:12] sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of
[24:14] names of blasphemy
[24:16] having seven heads and ten horns the
[24:18] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[24:20] color and decked with gold and
[24:22] precious stones and pearls having a
[24:24] golden cup in her hand full of
[24:25] abominations
[24:26] and filthiness of her fornication
[24:29] we know that this is the catholic church
[24:31] in verse five it's called mystery
[24:33] babylon
[24:33] and mystery babylon is the catholic
[24:35] church who's a mother of harlot she's a
[24:37] and she's a mother of harlots
[24:39] which are the protestant systems the
[24:41] denominational systems are horn harlots
[24:44] but look how beautiful she was she's a
[24:47] red and purple
[24:48] and scarlet and decked with gold and
[24:51] precious stones and pearls
[24:53] having a golden cup in her hand she's
[24:56] not ugly
[24:57] she's not scary looking she doesn't look
[24:59] hideous and nasty like a witch
[25:01] she's beautiful so much so that john he
[25:04] marveled
[25:06] he looked upon her with great admiration
[25:10] he was astonished she was so beautiful
[25:12] to behold
[25:13] but she was beautiful but she was wrong
[25:18] vasti was beautiful but vashti was wrong
[25:22] let's go over to revelations 18
[25:26] and after these things i saw another
[25:27] angel come down from heaven having a
[25:29] great
[25:29] power and the earth was lighted with his
[25:31] glory and he cried mightily with a
[25:33] strong voice saying babylon the greatest
[25:35] fallen
[25:36] is fallen has become the habitation of
[25:38] devils in the hold
[25:39] of every foul spirit in a cage of every
[25:42] unclean and hateful bird
[25:44] that's the condition according to the
[25:46] scripture of the catholic church
[25:50] that's what they are now fallen
[25:54] and the hold for every devil an unclean
[25:56] spirit
[25:59] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[26:01] of the wrath of her fornications and the
[26:02] kings of the earth have committed
[26:04] fornication with her
[26:05] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[26:07] rich to the abundance of her delicacies
[26:09] we've been watching that happen we've
[26:12] been watching the kings drunk
[26:14] with their fornications they got
[26:17] drunk at the united nations they got
[26:18] drunk at the white house they got drunk
[26:20] in congress when the pope showed up
[26:23] believing his lies and his deceit
[26:28] and heard another voice thank god for
[26:31] another voice
[26:33] there's one that declares the condition
[26:35] of the church systems but there's also
[26:36] another voice
[26:37] giving instructions on what to do about
[26:39] the conditions and another voice and i
[26:41] heard another voice from heaven
[26:42] saying come out of her my people
[26:46] that you be not partakers of her sins
[26:48] and that you receive not of her plagues
[26:50] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[26:52] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[26:55] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[26:57] double unto her double according to her
[26:59] works
[26:59] and the cup which she hath filled filled
[27:01] to her double
[27:03] how much she has glorified herself
[27:08] who's been glorified she is
[27:14] now vashti forgot
[27:17] who her husband was vashti forgot
[27:21] how she became a queen because she
[27:24] became a queen
[27:26] by marrying the king
[27:30] not of her own merit not of her own
[27:33] worth
[27:34] and not she didn't rise to queen all by
[27:36] herself
[27:37] you can't be a queen without marrying
[27:39] the king
[27:41] and she forgot how she got to her
[27:44] position
[27:45] amen now the church here in revelations
[27:49] 18
[27:49] has forgot who would ever make her
[27:52] special
[27:53] who would make her the queen now
[27:56] she's glorified herself
[28:00] and lived deliciously so much so much
[28:03] torment and sorrow give her for she
[28:05] saith in her heart
[28:06] i sit a queen
[28:10] and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
[28:16] do you think that the great churches of
[28:18] the systems and the great
[28:20] denominational system churches and the
[28:22] and the great
[28:23] uh catholic church do you think they're
[28:25] going to see destruction in this age
[28:28] do you think they're that they think
[28:30] they're gonna miss the rapture and fall
[28:31] into tribulation
[28:32] no i sit as a queen i am no widow
[28:36] and i will see no sorrow
[28:42] next verse therefore shall her plagues
[28:45] come in one day
[28:47] death and mourning and famine and she
[28:49] shall be utterly burned with fire for
[28:51] strong as the lord god who judgeth
[28:53] her her destruction will come in one day
[28:56] when russia drops a nuclear bomb
[28:59] on the vatican and her destruction will
[29:01] come in one
[29:02] day the scripture will be fulfilled
[29:07] let's go back to revelations 3.
[29:14] and look at the condition of the church
[29:18] verse 14 and unto the angel the church
[29:21] of laodicea write these things saith the
[29:23] amen
[29:23] the faithful and true witness the
[29:25] beginning of the creation of god
[29:27] i know thy works that thou art neither
[29:28] cold nor hot i would
[29:30] thou work cold or hot so then because
[29:32] thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[29:34] hot i will spew thee out of my mouth
[29:36] because thou sayest i am rich and
[29:39] increased with goods
[29:40] and have need of nothing same condition
[29:43] in the entire church age that we find in
[29:46] mystery babylon
[29:47] because the has passed it to the
[29:48] harlots and the harlots has passed it
[29:51] through the waters that she sits over
[29:53] through the people
[29:54] nations and tongues and now the people
[29:56] in this age
[29:57] and people that are still stuck in
[29:59] laodicea the age that we're living in in
[30:01] the natural life
[30:02] the people in that age they're still
[30:04] saying saying i am rich
[30:07] and increased with goods and have need
[30:09] of nothing
[30:10] he's not talking about a natural
[30:12] condition he's talking about a spiritual
[30:14] condition they're not saying i'm rich
[30:16] with money and all this
[30:18] he's talking about the spiritual
[30:20] condition they believe
[30:21] spiritually they're rich they believe
[30:23] spiritually
[30:24] they're increased with goods and
[30:26] spiritually they have need of nothing
[30:29] and he's going to point out the
[30:31] spiritual condition noah's thou
[30:33] not thou art wretched and miserable poor
[30:36] and blind and naked
[30:40] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[30:42] in the fire
[30:43] that thou mayest be rich and white
[30:45] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[30:46] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[30:48] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[30:50] eyesalve that thou
[30:51] mayest see
[30:55] amen let's go back to esther
[30:58] queen vashti means beautiful amen
[31:04] she had worldly beauty she had no
[31:06] character
[31:13] verse 19 still in chapter one of esther
[31:17] if it pleased the king let there go a
[31:18] royal commandment from him
[31:20] and let it be written among the laws of
[31:22] the persians and the medes
[31:23] so now there's a problem what are we
[31:24] going to do about this vashti
[31:26] and i want to back up here for just a
[31:28] minute
[31:29] to verse 16 because i want to show
[31:31] something that's amazing
[31:33] in verse 16 it says and mummakin
[31:35] answered before the king
[31:36] and the princes vashti the queen hath
[31:39] not done wrong to the king only but also
[31:41] to all the princes and to all the people
[31:43] that are in all the provinces of king
[31:44] hazaris
[31:46] now it's it's amazing there are seven
[31:48] princes that sit before the king and
[31:49] help him rule
[31:50] and in seven princes the last prince or
[31:53] the seventh prince is this mummikin
[31:55] and mummakin is the one who catches the
[31:57] revelation of the significance of this
[31:59] event
[32:01] it's interesting it wasn't the third one
[32:03] mentioned it wasn't the fourth it wasn't
[32:04] the fifth
[32:04] it was the seventh prince
[32:09] consists do we see the consistency in
[32:11] the scripture
[32:13] the seventh one he's the one who catches
[32:15] the significance of this event
[32:17] and he's the one who comes up with the
[32:19] solution
[32:22] right and here's part of the solution in
[32:24] verse 19.
[32:25] if it pleased the king let there go out
[32:27] a royal commandment from
[32:28] from him and let it be written among the
[32:30] laws of the persians and the medes
[32:32] that it be not altered that vashti come
[32:34] no more before the king and hazaris
[32:36] and let the king give her royal estate
[32:38] unto another
[32:39] that is better than she
[32:45] how are you going to get better than
[32:47] vashti
[32:48] vashti's beautiful vashti is the
[32:52] most beautiful vasti's got it all
[32:56] how are you going to be better than
[32:57] vashti there was one place that vashti
[33:00] was decrepit
[33:02] and that was in character she may have
[33:04] had wealth she may have had a good
[33:06] bloodline
[33:07] she may have had beauty that nobody
[33:08] could match but she had
[33:10] no character because character would
[33:12] have given her the heart
[33:13] to obey the command of the king because
[33:16] that's the true test of character
[33:19] let's go to chapter 2 verse 2
[33:22] then said the king's servant that
[33:24] ministered unto him let there be fair
[33:26] young virgins sought for the king
[33:28] and let the king appoint officers in all
[33:29] the provinces of his kingdom that they
[33:31] may
[33:31] gather together all the fair young
[33:33] virgins unto shush and the palace
[33:35] to the house of the women unto the
[33:36] custody of haggai the king's chamberlain
[33:39] keeper of the women and let their things
[33:41] be for purification
[33:42] be given them and let the maiden which
[33:45] pleaseth
[33:46] the king be queen instead of vashti
[33:49] and the thing pleased the king and he
[33:51] did so
[33:52] now this is a great idea
[33:55] he's got a wonderful idea let's gather
[33:58] fair young virgins from all over and
[34:00] let's put him in the house of the women
[34:01] with haggy eye
[34:02] haggai's another eunuch another eunuch
[34:04] that is a servant of the king
[34:05] another one that has no seed now he's
[34:07] the keeper of the women
[34:08] of who the fair young virgins what's his
[34:12] job
[34:13] prepare them to meet the king
[34:17] who do you think this is
[34:20] malachi 4 you got it brother revelations
[34:23] 10
[34:23] 7. this is haggai the chamberlain the
[34:26] eunuch that that is in the service of
[34:27] the king
[34:28] keeper of the house of women and what's
[34:30] he doing what's his ministry
[34:31] he's preparing them to meet the king why
[34:35] because somebody's going to get married
[34:37] in the seventh month
[34:39] vashti's going to be refused in the
[34:40] seventh month because he refused a king
[34:42] and somebody's going to get married in
[34:44] the seventh month one of these fair
[34:46] young virgins is going to get married
[34:48] but they've got to go through haggai the
[34:50] keeper of the women
[34:51] first
[34:55] nobody just walks into the presence of
[34:57] the king
[34:58] unprepared you've got justification
[35:02] the calling of the virgins you've got
[35:04] sanctification the house of purification
[35:06] with haggy eye
[35:07] and then you've got the baptism of the
[35:09] holy ghost the night with the king
[35:13] amen it's all in esther
[35:17] and it's been there for how many
[35:19] thousands of years but it's been laying
[35:21] there as a love letter so that in the
[35:23] last days
[35:24] a little bride can pick it up and say
[35:26] that's me
[35:27] i'm looking in the mirror that's me mama
[35:29] that's me
[35:31] i'm esther i'm not bestie i know i'm not
[35:34] vashti because i won't refuse the king
[35:38] amen how do they refuse to king
[35:42] refuse the chamberlains
[35:45] refused the chamberlains he refused the
[35:47] king
[35:50] so now we've got to find one that
[35:52] pleaseth
[35:54] the king now the king
[35:59] is not this time looking for beauty
[36:03] he had beauty
[36:08] vashti wasn't put away because she
[36:10] wasn't beautiful enough
[36:13] vashti wasn't put away because she
[36:14] wasn't perfect in every natural sense of
[36:17] the word perfect
[36:18] vashti wasn't put away because her
[36:20] bloodline wasn't good enough
[36:21] vashti was not put away because she
[36:23] didn't have the right mannerisms to be
[36:25] queen
[36:25] because she didn't have the the right
[36:28] mode of conduct or the right kind of
[36:30] speech and language
[36:31] she had everything it took to be a good
[36:33] queen
[36:35] she was put away for one reason and one
[36:38] reason only
[36:40] amen and these church systems of this
[36:43] age have been put away for one reason
[36:45] and one reason only is because they
[36:47] refused the king
[36:50] amen so he's not looking for another one
[36:52] with a royal bloodline
[36:54] amen he's not looking for another one
[36:57] that knows how to say
[36:58] all the right words knows how to conduct
[37:00] themselves in royal court
[37:02] knows how to put on the royal apparel
[37:03] and the one that's more beautiful than
[37:05] all the others
[37:05] that's not what the king wants what he's
[37:08] looking for now is somebody that will
[37:10] not refuse him oh this is
[37:13] good this is good this
[37:17] is the king's choosing of a bride
[37:24] amen i love it so much
[37:35] brother branham says in the choosing of
[37:36] a bride
[37:38] now when you see a church that's in the
[37:39] world acts like the world anticipating
[37:42] in the world
[37:42] partaking of the world counting god's
[37:44] commandments as if he never had wrote
[37:46] them
[37:49] you don't have to look very far to find
[37:50] that
[37:53] as if he had never wrote them then you
[37:55] can just imagine
[37:56] christ ain't going to take a bride like
[37:58] that could you imagine taking the modern
[38:00] church today for a bride
[38:01] not my lord i could hardly see that
[38:04] no remember now a man and his wife are
[38:07] one
[38:10] what's brother branham teaching and
[38:11] choosing of a bride
[38:14] he comes to choosing of a bride and what
[38:16] he's showing is that a man
[38:18] will select a wife that will reflect his
[38:21] own character
[38:24] think about that now he's typing in the
[38:27] natural but he's trying to type the
[38:28] natural to the spiritual
[38:30] he's trying to show christ is not
[38:32] looking for a bride just any old bride
[38:34] he's not looking for the most beautiful
[38:36] the church or the biggest number of
[38:37] people or those
[38:38] that can say it all right that can
[38:39] pronounce all the words and have the
[38:41] bible memorized he's not looking for
[38:43] that
[38:44] he's looking for a bride that reflects
[38:46] his very own
[38:47] character brother brahm said if you go
[38:49] and and
[38:50] you take just any old thing off the
[38:51] street and a man would just choose a
[38:53] woman that would live any old kind of
[38:55] unclean life and marry her it shows
[38:57] what's inside of him
[38:58] he's reflecting his own character by his
[39:01] choice for a wife
[39:02] now if that's true in the natural when
[39:03] it's true in the spiritual
[39:05] god cannot choose just any old thing and
[39:07] join himself to it
[39:08] because she wants to join the hymn no no
[39:11] no
[39:12] because he's got his character to uphold
[39:15] he's not going to join himself to
[39:17] anything
[39:18] that will not reflect his own character
[39:22] that's why vashti had to be put away
[39:24] because she refused the king
[39:25] and he's going to find one that won't
[39:28] refuse him
[39:37] the book of acts speaking out the
[39:39] choosing of david for king
[39:42] acts 13 21 and afterward they desired a
[39:44] king and god gave unto them saul the son
[39:46] of
[39:47] kish a man of the tribe of benjamin by
[39:49] the space of forty years
[39:51] and when he had removed him he raised up
[39:53] unto them david to be their king
[39:55] to whom also he gave testimony and said
[39:57] i have found david the son of jesse
[39:59] a man after my own heart
[40:04] what did david do reflected the king's
[40:06] character
[40:08] a man after mine own heart a man that
[40:11] reflects
[40:11] my character he said i shall choose them
[40:14] a king of
[40:14] my choosing right
[40:17] so samuel went with the anointing oil to
[40:19] help choose the king so he went to the
[40:20] house of jesse
[40:21] in iliad the firstborn walks in and he
[40:24] he's everything a king should be
[40:29] everything a king should be head and
[40:31] shoulders broad shoulders
[40:32] he's a fighting man big full beard he's
[40:34] ready to go
[40:36] the one they can respect the one that
[40:38] the armies can follow behind
[40:40] samuel goes to put the oil over his head
[40:42] and the lord says stop i've refused him
[40:48] man sees on the outward
[40:51] but god sees the hearts
[40:55] so if god's looking in the heart what's
[40:56] he looking for he's looking for what
[40:59] david had
[41:00] not what eliav had not what saul had
[41:02] he's looking for what david had
[41:04] in acts he says i have found david the
[41:07] son of jesse a man after my own heart
[41:09] which shall fulfill all
[41:12] my will that's what he's looking for
[41:17] that's the character that he wants amen
[41:20] he's not looking for beauty he's not
[41:22] looking for broad shoulders he's not
[41:24] looking for somebody that can command
[41:25] the respective men
[41:26] he's looking for somebody that will
[41:28] respect him and his word and his
[41:30] commandments
[41:31] that's where saul failed but that's
[41:33] where david was successful
[41:38] so what's the king looking for looking
[41:40] for character
[41:43] brother ben finishing this quote from
[41:45] choosing of a bride
[41:48] and then how about god joining himself
[41:50] to something like that a regular
[41:52] denominational prostitute
[41:54] you think he would do it having a form
[41:56] of godliness but denying the power
[41:58] thereof
[41:59] he would never do it
[42:03] amen there's a scripture in the old
[42:05] testament i didn't pull it up so you'll
[42:07] have to find it later
[42:08] it says in that day seven women shall
[42:10] grab a hold of one man
[42:13] and say we will eat our own bread and we
[42:16] will basically take care of ourselves
[42:17] only give us of thy name
[42:21] what did they want they wanted the
[42:22] benefits of the name they wanted the
[42:24] benefits of the relationship
[42:25] but they really wanted to do it their
[42:27] own way amen and there's been seven
[42:29] church ages
[42:30] so seven women have all treated the lord
[42:32] the same way they've grabbed a hold of
[42:34] him and said we'll eat our own bread
[42:36] we'll do our own thing only give us of
[42:38] your name
[42:39] and they've taken the name and they've
[42:40] attached it to the church the church of
[42:42] jesus christ
[42:43] the church of christ church of this
[42:44] church of death brother branham said
[42:46] those are blasphemious names
[42:48] why are they blasphemous names because
[42:50] the church doctrine is blaspheming the
[42:52] word of god
[42:53] blaspheming the holy ghost and so
[42:54] they've taken his name
[42:56] amen but they've not married to him
[42:58] they've not submitted to him
[43:00] they've not given up their life they
[43:01] still want to eat their own bread and go
[43:03] their own way
[43:05] if you want to understand
[43:06] denominationalism that's it right there
[43:09] give us your name but we'll do our own
[43:10] thing
[43:12] amen that's what vashti thought she
[43:16] could do
[43:17] it didn't work so she was put away
[43:21] he would never do that back in choosing
[43:23] of o'brien she must have
[43:25] his character in her
[43:31] she must have his character in her
[43:35] the real true born-again church must
[43:37] have the character that was in
[43:38] christ because the husband and the wife
[43:41] are one
[43:42] and if jesus did only that which please
[43:44] god kept his word and manifest his word
[43:47] his bride will have to be of the same
[43:49] kind of character
[43:51] she could she could not by no means be a
[43:53] denomination
[43:55] hallelujah you know what
[43:59] i love that we have a voice
[44:03] in this day that will stand against
[44:05] every
[44:06] other voice that's speaking amen
[44:16] brother braham said in end time
[44:17] evangelism god's looking for character
[44:19] not membership
[44:20] character eliezer when he went to get
[44:23] the bride for isaac he sweated it out
[44:25] until he found
[44:26] character that's the end time message
[44:29] he and the bride god's looking for
[44:32] character
[44:33] and then after eliezer found the
[44:35] character then the next thing was
[44:37] getting her ready to go
[44:39] that's the same now brother the same now
[44:42] brother branham's ministry was the
[44:44] ministry of eliezer what was his
[44:45] ministry
[44:46] to find and bring a bride to isaac amen
[44:52] then he says in god hiding himself in
[44:54] simplicity
[44:56] first message when he preached the
[44:57] series on the seals he's talking about
[44:59] the dedication of the of the tabernacle
[45:01] he says may it be a consecrated place to
[45:03] our lord
[45:04] a consecrated people for no matter how
[45:06] beautiful the structure is
[45:08] that we certainly do appreciate the
[45:10] beauty of the church
[45:11] is the character of the people i trust
[45:14] it will always be a house
[45:16] of god's beauty a house of god of beauty
[45:20] amen let's pick up our story back in
[45:24] esther again
[45:25] we're in chapter two let's go to verse
[45:27] five because esther is about to step on
[45:29] the scene
[45:30] now esther doesn't step on the scene
[45:32] until after
[45:33] vashti's refused
[45:38] now in shusham the palace there was a
[45:40] certain jew whose name was mordecai the
[45:42] son of jar the son of
[45:43] shemiya the son of kish a benjaminite
[45:46] another thing that i
[45:47] find interesting in the in the story of
[45:48] redemption that's in esther here
[45:50] is somehow esther's rise to the throne
[45:52] has something to do with the tribe of
[45:53] benjamin
[45:57] that's amazing because brother branham
[45:58] calls 144 000
[46:00] that are redeemed out of the nation of
[46:02] israel by the two prophets
[46:04] in revelations 11 he calls them the
[46:06] tribe of benjamin
[46:07] the 144 000 the little benjaminites amen
[46:11] so now i mean mordecai could have been
[46:13] from any tribe right there's 12 to pick
[46:15] from
[46:16] he happened to be a benjamin because the
[46:18] queen and the 144 thousand
[46:20] their destinies are interlocked amen
[46:28] that's verse down to seven and he
[46:30] brought up hadassah that is esther his
[46:33] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[46:35] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[46:36] and beautiful
[46:37] whom mordecai when her father and mother
[46:39] were dead took for his own daughter so
[46:42] now
[46:42] we find out where esther comes from now
[46:44] esther is going to be selected
[46:46] when all these fair virgins are selected
[46:47] and she's going to go into the house
[46:49] now let's look at this story in in verse
[46:52] 13.
[46:53] then thus came every maiden to the king
[46:56] whatsoever she desired
[46:58] was given to her to go with her out of
[47:00] the house of the women
[47:01] into the king's house
[47:05] in the evening she went and on the
[47:06] morrow she returned
[47:08] in the second house of the women to the
[47:10] custody of sheches
[47:11] the king's chamberlain which kept the
[47:12] concubines she came in unto the king no
[47:15] more except the king delighted in her
[47:17] and that she were called by name
[47:19] now i want to look at this in verse 13.
[47:24] she goes to the house of women which is
[47:27] oversaw by haggai the king's chamberlain
[47:30] and the king is there or the chamberlain
[47:32] is there
[47:33] to make sure that the women go through
[47:36] the purification process
[47:38] that's his job to make sure they have
[47:40] everything they need for purification
[47:42] that means they have all the spices and
[47:44] all the oils and all the baths and
[47:46] everything they need and he took esther
[47:48] and esther found favor in his eyes and
[47:50] he set her in a good part of the house
[47:52] with seven maids of her own she had
[47:53] seven maids
[47:57] so he he puts her there and and he's
[48:00] giving the
[48:01] all the fair young virgins they're all
[48:03] getting what they need to prepare to go
[48:05] in and meet the king
[48:06] because they can't just walk in and meet
[48:08] the king they can't just come off the
[48:10] street and meet the king
[48:11] there has to be a preparation so that
[48:13] they could become one with the king
[48:16] so they're going through a
[48:17] sanctification process and they're going
[48:19] through a purification process
[48:21] that they go into the king amen
[48:24] but it says whatsoever when it came time
[48:27] for her to go into the king
[48:28] now she's had whatever hegei uh had
[48:31] ordered for her
[48:32] for the purification process the
[48:34] ointments and the oils and the perfumes
[48:35] and the baths and whatever the hair care
[48:37] products
[48:38] whatever they got the best of the best
[48:39] i'm sure i mean it was a salon
[48:42] and this salon lasted 12 months
[48:46] how many manicures can you get in 12
[48:48] months
[48:50] all right so the purification process
[48:52] was 12 months long and they had
[48:53] everything
[48:54] that they ever needed before they went
[48:55] to the king but there was also this
[48:57] stipulation
[48:59] whatever she desired was given her
[49:03] to go with her out of the house of the
[49:05] women into the king's house
[49:08] so her free moral agency was never taken
[49:11] away
[49:14] she could take with her to go stand
[49:17] before the king and to meet the king
[49:18] to see whether the king is pleased with
[49:20] her or not she could take
[49:22] anything she wanted with her
[49:26] god has never taken away our free moral
[49:28] agency
[49:30] but our free moral agency is a test
[49:33] always has been and always will be
[49:37] what is it that you want to take with
[49:38] you to the presence of the king
[49:40] what is it that you want to hold on to
[49:42] is it a relationship is it a friend is
[49:44] it a husband is it a wife is it a son is
[49:46] it a daughter
[49:47] what are you trying to drag with you
[49:48] into the presence of the king because
[49:50] you can take whatsoever you want
[49:51] amen amen
[49:57] now verse 14 in the evening she went and
[50:00] on tomorrow she returned
[50:01] so she came out of the house of hagia
[50:04] the house of the women for preparation
[50:06] she went to meet the king and then the
[50:07] next day she went to the house of
[50:09] concubines
[50:11] except that was the process
[50:14] here to here to here
[50:17] except
[50:21] she came into the kingdom more except
[50:24] the king
[50:25] delighted her and that she were called
[50:28] by
[50:30] name
[50:34] now when it comes to the choosing of a
[50:37] bride
[50:39] this is so good i can't hardly stand it
[50:43] when it comes to the choosing of a bride
[50:45] it's haggai's job
[50:47] to find the virgins to get them in the
[50:49] house and to make sure that they're
[50:50] ready for their encounter with the king
[50:55] but these virgins are never they've
[50:57] never lost their free mortal agency
[50:59] they can go stand there in any condition
[51:01] they want they can take anything they
[51:02] want with them
[51:05] and then it's not haggai who chooses
[51:07] it's the king
[51:09] himself who chooses the bride
[51:13] by calling her name
[51:18] oh haggai can't pick the bride
[51:23] haggai he may have his favorites he may
[51:25] have his list of top ten
[51:26] he may know who the top two contenders
[51:28] are in his mind but haggy i can't choose
[51:30] the bride
[51:31] only the king can choose the one that
[51:34] pleases him
[51:36] and if he has chosen her she'll know
[51:38] because she will be called by
[51:40] name oh it gets so exciting
[51:46] i used to read the book of esther i had
[51:47] no idea what it was about just a neat
[51:50] little love story right
[51:51] that's so neat that little common girl
[51:54] and also she's a queen
[51:55] that is so neat and now
[51:59] with the greater revelation to go back
[52:00] and read esther and i'm looking in the
[52:02] mirror
[52:03] and i'm saying that's me that's me i've
[52:06] been in the house of purification
[52:08] i've been chosen many are many are
[52:10] called but few
[52:11] are chosen i've been called to the house
[52:14] of virgins
[52:14] i've been justified i've been sanctified
[52:17] through the purification
[52:18] process been i went to my encounter with
[52:20] the king
[52:24] brother bam talked about a fourth step
[52:30] the fourth step you know pentecost
[52:33] got a baptism of the holy ghost
[52:36] pentecost got an encounter with the king
[52:38] but they weren't allowed to marry him
[52:45] something
[52:47] beyond a night with the king is going to
[52:50] take place
[52:52] somebody's going to get their name
[52:54] called and somebody's
[52:56] going to be the queen
[53:00] hallelujah
[53:06] let's just look at this
[53:09] calling a name for a minute
[53:19] before we get there no let's look at
[53:22] calling a name
[53:24] questions and answers on the seals
[53:27] they had a question about who will be
[53:29] saved and he says nothing will be saved
[53:31] only those whose names were written and
[53:32] put on the lamb's book of life before
[53:34] the foundation of the world
[53:35] jew or gentile see that's all the book
[53:38] holds the mystery
[53:39] and the book is unfolding it now
[53:44] he's in question and answers in the
[53:46] seals between the 6th and 7th seal
[53:48] the book is only unfolding it now not
[53:51] each one's name but what the mystery of
[53:54] the book is
[53:55] while it's calling those names
[54:03] what's calling the names the unfolding
[54:06] of the mystery
[54:07] of the book
[54:12] you understand that now the book doesn't
[54:15] say now leave
[54:16] all's to be saved in the time of this
[54:17] church age or ormond neville or whoever
[54:19] no it don't say that it just shows the
[54:22] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[54:24] thing is
[54:25] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[54:28] what's he talking about the calling of
[54:30] your name
[54:32] how is he calling your name by revealing
[54:34] the mystery in the seventh seal book
[54:37] and the mystery unfolds the names that
[54:39] are in the book and it's not that you
[54:40] look down and you not see
[54:42] lee veil will come out it's not that
[54:44] kind of reading of a name
[54:45] but the unveiling of the book is calling
[54:48] your name
[54:50] who's calling your name was it hagiai no
[54:53] it was the king
[54:55] how many people heard about the
[54:57] unfolding of the book how many people
[54:59] heard about what was taking place and
[55:01] they didn't hear their name
[55:03] but there's a few people on the earth
[55:04] when they heard the unfolding of the
[55:06] book
[55:06] they heard more than there's a white
[55:08] horse rider they heard more than a red
[55:10] horse ride
[55:10] they heard more than souls under the
[55:12] altar they heard their name
[55:15] they said i'm there that's me that's my
[55:18] redemption
[55:19] that's my title deed
[55:24] what do we find we found our position in
[55:26] the book
[55:27] not because i looked over and read it
[55:28] not because brother branham said chadlam
[55:30] will be here
[55:31] he'll come in 1977.
[55:34] no when it was my time
[55:37] in the presence of the king i heard my
[55:41] name
[55:43] why how by the unfolding of the
[55:46] mysteries
[55:50] hallelujah
[55:57] let's go back to our scripture
[56:01] verse 15.
[56:04] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[56:06] of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had
[56:08] taken her daughter was to come to go
[56:10] into the king
[56:12] now listen she had free moral agency
[56:16] every other woman could take whatsoever
[56:18] she desired through the presence of the
[56:19] king
[56:20] but listen to what esther chose
[56:23] to take she required
[56:27] nothing but what haggai
[56:30] the king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[56:32] women appointed
[56:34] not her own idea not her own thought not
[56:37] another relationship
[56:38] not a denominational way of thinking not
[56:40] somebody else's idea on it
[56:42] she when she went to her encounter with
[56:44] the king she took
[56:45] only only only what haggai
[56:50] the chamberlain the keeper of the women
[56:52] the prophet of the seventh age
[56:54] the seventh messenger only what he
[56:56] appointed
[56:59] nobody else goes into his presence like
[57:02] that except for the bride
[57:03] esther's the only one everybody else has
[57:06] their own little idea of what of what
[57:08] god likes or what will please the king
[57:10] or god just loves me or i'm so sweet and
[57:12] i'm so special he would never refuse me
[57:17] he had that in vashti he ain't looking
[57:19] for it again
[57:21] that's why they were given permission to
[57:23] take anything they wanted with them
[57:25] to the presence of the king oh he'll
[57:26] like this little lipstick and he'll like
[57:28] this eyeshadow he'll like these heels
[57:30] he'll like this little dress
[57:31] he'll like this and haggai you know what
[57:33] not one of these virgins have ever been
[57:35] in the presence of the king before
[57:36] but guess who's been there guess who
[57:39] knows what the king likes
[57:41] guess who's the one who's actually been
[57:42] in this presence guess who the one that
[57:44] the king gives commandments lift to ear
[57:46] to
[57:47] it's the haggai it's not the virgins
[57:49] they've never one time
[57:50] ever one time had the lord speak to them
[57:53] directly but haggai has
[57:55] and so now these foolish virgins think
[57:57] that they know what's going to please
[57:58] the king
[57:59] and the hagia is an old crank and he
[58:00] don't know but i'm so special
[58:02] he'll choose me the king had that in
[58:06] vastly and the king doesn't want it no
[58:07] more and he doesn't want it today
[58:09] what he wants is an esther who will step
[58:11] up a fair young virgin who's went
[58:13] through a purification process
[58:14] in the house that haggai is watching
[58:16] over that'll step up and require
[58:18] nothing but what came from that prophet
[58:23] because he's been there and he knows
[58:25] what he's talking about
[58:27] that's why every denominational system
[58:30] has failed
[58:31] because she goes in in her own thinking
[58:33] mix her idea
[58:34] with the word of god and come out with
[58:36] something polluted and produced another
[58:37] vasty
[58:38] well the king went through that once he
[58:40] ain't going through it again
[58:42] amen
[58:48] we know we know
[58:53] that this chamberlain knew what he was
[58:54] talking about
[58:58] we know this chamberlain's been behind
[59:00] the veil
[59:02] he's been to the inner chamber he's seen
[59:04] the high court of the lord
[59:06] he's seen the book in his hand he's seen
[59:09] it open
[59:10] he knows exactly what he's talking about
[59:13] so esther's sitting there i i don't know
[59:18] i'll just take what he said
[59:22] and not add my own interpretation to it
[59:25] i'll just take
[59:26] what he said when it's my time to
[59:29] encounter the king
[59:31] hallelujah you see the fallacy of
[59:34] leaving this message behind
[59:36] it's a virgin trying to put lipstick and
[59:39] rouge on herself to please the king
[59:40] she has no idea what the king likes
[59:45] but haggai got the commandment lip to
[59:47] ear
[59:48] and he knows what the king likes that's
[59:51] why in the natural type it's so foolish
[59:53] that we still
[59:54] have to play games with how long this
[59:55] long hair and how much makeup and makeup
[59:57] and how short is my skirt
[59:59] just listen to what haggy i said he's
[1:00:01] been there he knows what he's talking
[1:00:03] about
[1:00:05] but we've got our own ideas about this
[1:00:07] oh well this is okay and that's okay
[1:00:09] how do you know it's okay you don't know
[1:00:12] it's okay
[1:00:13] listen to the one who knows
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:21] we would rather walk a line to please
[1:00:23] man than run away from the line to
[1:00:25] please god
[1:00:26] that's exactly what all that is is just
[1:00:28] trying to get some
[1:00:29] some approval from our fellow sister or
[1:00:31] brother who cares about your sister and
[1:00:33] brother
[1:00:34] haggie i told you how to get approval
[1:00:35] from god
[1:00:40] she required nothing but what haggai the
[1:00:44] king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[1:00:45] woman appointed
[1:00:46] and esther obtained favor in the sight
[1:00:48] of all them that looked upon her
[1:00:50] so esther was taken into king alhazaras
[1:00:52] unto the house royal
[1:00:53] guess when in the 10th month
[1:00:58] which is the month tebus in the seventh
[1:01:00] year of his reign
[1:01:01] you mean she went in in 10-7
[1:01:06] when did she go in in 10-7
[1:01:09] you mean like revelations 10 7 when the
[1:01:11] mystery of god is revealed
[1:01:13] that's when she goes into the king
[1:01:15] absolutely
[1:01:16] because that's when the mighty angel
[1:01:18] comes down to what join himself with the
[1:01:21] bride
[1:01:23] so she went in in 10-7 when was
[1:01:26] atonement
[1:01:27] in the 10th month or in the 10th day of
[1:01:30] the seventh month
[1:01:32] leviticus 23 when it speaks of the day
[1:01:36] of atonement
[1:01:37] it flips him and says not in the
[1:01:41] seventh month and on the tenth day no it
[1:01:44] says
[1:01:45] in the tenth day on the tenth day of the
[1:01:47] seventh month
[1:01:50] because redemption and atonement is
[1:01:51] completed in 10-7
[1:01:53] amen it's come to fullness in 10-7 and
[1:01:56] esther goes into the king
[1:01:58] and 10 7.
[1:02:02] oh do you read the love letter now are
[1:02:04] you reading it
[1:02:05] is this your love letter are you reading
[1:02:06] between the lines
[1:02:08] who cares about a day and a month i'm
[1:02:11] hearing 10 7.
[1:02:14] hallelujah i found my place in 10
[1:02:17] 7. i heard my name called in 10 7.
[1:02:20] what about you i had my encounter with
[1:02:22] the king in 10-7
[1:02:24] what about you amen
[1:02:33] praise god
[1:02:37] she went to the house row in the 10th
[1:02:38] month which is the month tibet in the
[1:02:40] seventh year of his reign
[1:02:41] and the king loved esther above all
[1:02:45] women
[1:02:45] all the women and she obtained grace and
[1:02:48] favor in his sight
[1:02:49] more than all the virgins so that she
[1:02:51] said he set the royal crown upon her
[1:02:54] head
[1:02:54] and made her queen instead of vashti
[1:02:59] oh we got a queen in this day thinks
[1:03:01] she's a queen says i said a queen and
[1:03:02] have need of nothing
[1:03:04] and no sorrow will come to me she
[1:03:05] doesn't know she's already been
[1:03:06] dethroned
[1:03:07] and he's already selected another queen
[1:03:10] and he's about to reveal it to the whole
[1:03:11] world
[1:03:14] amen praise god
[1:03:19] now vashti went in she required only
[1:03:23] those things that haggy i appointed
[1:03:24] that was her perfume that was how she
[1:03:26] did her hair that was the clothing she
[1:03:28] wore
[1:03:28] the kind of shoes she had all of that
[1:03:30] was determined by haggai
[1:03:33] brother branham says in the present
[1:03:34] stage of my ministry he says i hope
[1:03:37] i hope he will crown my ministry of this
[1:03:40] of letting me take the close of the word
[1:03:43] and dress
[1:03:44] his bride
[1:03:48] brother brent of saying in 1962
[1:03:52] before the seals and he's here in
[1:03:53] september and he's going to get the
[1:03:55] vision for christ as a mystery
[1:03:56] in december just a couple months later
[1:03:59] and that that's going to bring out the
[1:04:00] sequence of events that's going to bring
[1:04:02] the opening of the word
[1:04:03] the opening of the seals he says i hope
[1:04:06] he will crown my ministry of this
[1:04:09] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:04:10] word and dress his bride
[1:04:12] in the clothes of the word for his
[1:04:15] righteousness
[1:04:19] what else are you going to put on what
[1:04:21] else are you going to put on
[1:04:23] you're going to have a baptist leave and
[1:04:26] a pentecostal skirt
[1:04:28] and a catholic top it's not going to
[1:04:31] work
[1:04:33] but this haggai his crowning of his
[1:04:35] ministry
[1:04:36] was to give clothes the right kind of
[1:04:41] garment spiritual now he's not talking
[1:04:44] he's not talking about spiritual the
[1:04:46] right kind of clothing
[1:04:48] so that we can be clothed in the wedding
[1:04:50] garment
[1:04:51] to meet the king
[1:04:54] oh there is no other way
[1:04:58] outside this message
[1:05:02] none i'll say it every day i'll say it
[1:05:05] every time i get in the pulpit
[1:05:06] there is no other way to meet and be
[1:05:09] accepted by the king
[1:05:10] outside of this message because it was
[1:05:13] the preparation work
[1:05:15] it was the work in the house of the
[1:05:16] women it was haggai who knew who had
[1:05:18] been in the inner chamber who knew how
[1:05:20] to prepare
[1:05:20] esther for her meeting with him
[1:05:24] and it's all about character
[1:05:27] why could esther and not all the other
[1:05:29] women just take what haggy i said
[1:05:32] how come all the other women had to take
[1:05:33] a little extra or do a little something
[1:05:34] else
[1:05:36] they had no character they might have
[1:05:38] all been beautiful
[1:05:40] but it doesn't matter the king already
[1:05:42] had beauty
[1:05:44] now he's not interested in beauty now
[1:05:47] he's interested in
[1:05:48] character that's why he's not looking
[1:05:51] for a big church or a denomination or
[1:05:53] this that or the other
[1:05:54] there's no organization there's no big
[1:05:55] system there's no great programs we
[1:05:57] ain't got it
[1:05:58] and we don't want it we only want that
[1:06:01] which haggai has appointed amen
[1:06:09] the choosing of a bride brother
[1:06:11] branham's talking about
[1:06:15] he makes a funny story about a cow how
[1:06:17] many remembers
[1:06:19] don't get all offended sisters he's just
[1:06:21] trying to make a type
[1:06:24] he says he was with this rancher and
[1:06:26] this rancher would look to buy
[1:06:28] beef cows to raise steers and he said
[1:06:31] he'd look at her you look her up and
[1:06:32] down and then he'd take and he'd turn
[1:06:33] her head and look her in the eye
[1:06:35] he said sometimes he'd just shake his
[1:06:36] head and walk away
[1:06:39] he said yes they said jeff why are you
[1:06:41] why you look that cow on the face she
[1:06:43] looks all right to me
[1:06:45] he says she may be all right she may be
[1:06:47] beef come to the hoof
[1:06:49] but if she's got that wild stare in her
[1:06:51] eye
[1:06:53] what was the rancher looking for
[1:06:55] character
[1:06:57] said she'll never be a mammy she'll
[1:06:58] never sit still she'll run the fences
[1:07:00] all this other stuff and brother bam
[1:07:02] says i think i learned a lesson about
[1:07:04] women
[1:07:09] he said you better too brother
[1:07:12] because if you get one with that wild
[1:07:13] stare in her eye she'll never be a mom
[1:07:15] she'll want to go work in some man's
[1:07:17] office she'll want to go do this that
[1:07:18] and be the head of the house and go do
[1:07:20] her own thing
[1:07:22] amen that won't make a christian home
[1:07:25] amen
[1:07:26] so he said you better watch and brother
[1:07:28] branham is typing this
[1:07:30] to christ in the bride he's taking the
[1:07:32] naturals about choosing a man would
[1:07:34] choose his bride reflect his own care
[1:07:35] and he's typing that right in to christ
[1:07:38] and the bride
[1:07:38] how christ is choosing a bride and he's
[1:07:42] chosen her
[1:07:42] predestination all right
[1:07:46] but in his predestinated thought he's
[1:07:48] always got this
[1:07:50] testing time right
[1:07:53] always has this testing time where
[1:07:55] you've got to be tested
[1:07:57] all right and and esther went through
[1:07:59] her testing time with hagiai
[1:08:00] and her approaching to the king but he's
[1:08:02] got to have this
[1:08:03] this testing time where if she meets the
[1:08:05] conditions
[1:08:07] then he's going to do something special
[1:08:10] he's going to call her name
[1:08:14] when after she's come into his presence
[1:08:16] and after she's met the condition
[1:08:18] now just as soon
[1:08:21] as the king makes his choice
[1:08:24] the moment the king makes his choice
[1:08:28] every other virgin is a concubine
[1:08:33] he's only got one bride doesn't matter
[1:08:36] how many how good the church is it
[1:08:37] doesn't
[1:08:38] matter how good the system is it doesn't
[1:08:40] matter how much they got right
[1:08:41] just as soon as he comes to choose a
[1:08:43] bride every other thing becomes a
[1:08:45] concubine
[1:08:47] amen because only one is going to bear
[1:08:50] fourth seed
[1:08:54] brother brandon i want to back up just a
[1:08:56] minute and i want to talk about what we
[1:08:58] talked about here i think it was last
[1:08:59] sunday
[1:09:00] and last sunday when we talked about
[1:09:02] redemption and the work of the high
[1:09:03] priest
[1:09:04] i believe it was last sunday and how the
[1:09:07] high priest would go on behind the mercy
[1:09:09] seat and do seven sprinklings of blood
[1:09:11] and
[1:09:11] and when that was done it was for the
[1:09:13] ignorance of the people and then he
[1:09:14] would come around and there'd be seven
[1:09:15] spring things before the throne
[1:09:17] and we showed how how jesus had been
[1:09:19] doing that work down through seven
[1:09:20] church ages do we remember that
[1:09:22] are we on the same page and how when he
[1:09:24] comes forth now
[1:09:26] now on that day of atonement he he takes
[1:09:29] the
[1:09:29] the simple garment because he's got
[1:09:31] royal robes the high priests have royal
[1:09:32] robes right and the high priest has a
[1:09:34] glorification he's got all the special
[1:09:36] things that
[1:09:37] that he wears but on the day of
[1:09:38] atonement he takes all the glorification
[1:09:40] off and puts on a simple linen garment
[1:09:42] for atonement and that was when when
[1:09:44] when christ came in the form of the lamb
[1:09:46] which was jesus the flesh man and then
[1:09:49] he does the work of the high priest and
[1:09:51] he's done with the work of the high
[1:09:52] priest when atonement's finished
[1:09:53] he takes off the simple linen garment
[1:09:55] and he leaves it in the sanctuary
[1:09:57] and then he comes out to the people and
[1:09:59] when he emerges from there
[1:10:01] they know that their sins are gone that
[1:10:02] atonement's been successful
[1:10:04] and all the sins of the nation are gone
[1:10:08] it's been no different in our day amen
[1:10:10] all right
[1:10:11] so we had that we talked about the lion
[1:10:13] and the lamb you've got to separate the
[1:10:15] lion and the lamb because these are both
[1:10:16] attributes of christ
[1:10:18] right he says behold the lion of the
[1:10:20] tribe of judah he has prevailed
[1:10:23] amen he's worthy to take the book and
[1:10:25] loose the seals thereof
[1:10:26] and he said when i turned and look i saw
[1:10:28] a lamb as it had been slain
[1:10:30] the lion prevailed but the lamb standing
[1:10:32] there because the lion and the lamb are
[1:10:34] the same person
[1:10:35] it's christ the lamb is the flesh body
[1:10:38] of jesus
[1:10:39] christ is the christ the logos of god
[1:10:41] from the beginning
[1:10:43] we got that so now on this
[1:10:47] day of atonement or this great work and
[1:10:48] atonement in heaven is complete after
[1:10:50] seven church ages
[1:10:51] now he takes off the simple linen
[1:10:53] garment and the lamb
[1:10:55] jesus stays in the sanctuary
[1:10:59] we got that all right so if the lamb
[1:11:03] stays there who was it that came out
[1:11:08] the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:11:12] the king what
[1:11:15] what's he doing why did the king come
[1:11:19] and what's the purpose of the king
[1:11:20] coming
[1:11:24] and the breach between the seven
[1:11:26] churches and the seven seals
[1:11:28] he said he's done his kinsmen work you
[1:11:30] know what the kinsmen work was to
[1:11:32] testify before the elders you remember
[1:11:33] boaz kicked off a shoe and so forth
[1:11:35] he's done all this now he's talking
[1:11:38] about the breach he's talking about
[1:11:39] revelation chapter five when the lamb
[1:11:40] comes and opens the seals
[1:11:42] he said he's been doing the kinsmen work
[1:11:44] now
[1:11:45] he types it with boaz doing the work of
[1:11:46] kinsmen redeemer
[1:11:48] now when did boaz
[1:11:51] marry ruth was it before the work of
[1:11:55] redemption
[1:11:57] during the work of redemption or after
[1:12:01] the work of redemption
[1:12:04] after he was finished after boaz had
[1:12:06] fully redeemed
[1:12:08] then boaz after he paid the price how he
[1:12:10] made the concrete through he done
[1:12:11] everything he had to do
[1:12:13] then he comes and he takes ruth and he
[1:12:15] marries ruth
[1:12:16] right here brother branham saying he's
[1:12:18] done all this now
[1:12:20] now he comes to take his bride
[1:12:24] he comes now as a king
[1:12:27] who the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:12:30] revelations 10 the mighty angel came
[1:12:32] down
[1:12:33] and when he when he thundered he roared
[1:12:35] as when a lion roareth
[1:12:38] why did he roar because he's not coming
[1:12:40] as the lamb
[1:12:41] that's the corporal body meeting in the
[1:12:43] air at the rapture he's coming now
[1:12:45] as the lion
[1:12:49] the king he comes now as a king
[1:12:52] he's looking for his queen
[1:12:59] in this book is the whole secret of it
[1:13:01] wrapped around seven seals
[1:13:03] seven seals waiting for him to come
[1:13:07] and the fifth seal
[1:13:13] actually in the christ is the mystery of
[1:13:15] god revealed webster
[1:13:18] says revelation to reveal webster says
[1:13:22] is to make known
[1:13:23] make known and especially webster says
[1:13:25] in divine truth the revelation means
[1:13:28] the revelation it's christ's way of
[1:13:31] making himself
[1:13:32] known to his church how do you hear your
[1:13:34] name called
[1:13:36] by the unfolding of the mysteries the
[1:13:38] mysteries are what
[1:13:40] christ then he says
[1:13:44] let me get this right
[1:13:49] then he says now somebody
[1:13:52] first seal now someday he rises from the
[1:13:55] father's throne and he goes to take his
[1:13:56] own throne
[1:13:58] now he comes forth to call a subject now
[1:14:00] how is he going to claim them
[1:14:04] now remember remember
[1:14:08] he's done the work of kinsmen redeemer
[1:14:11] the lamb
[1:14:12] remains in the sanctuary the lion of the
[1:14:14] tribe of judah
[1:14:15] the the theophany of god the fullness of
[1:14:17] the holy ghost comes down
[1:14:19] the lion of the tribe of judah comes
[1:14:21] down he's the king
[1:14:23] looking for his queen
[1:14:27] he's calling he's coming to claim his
[1:14:29] redeemed subjects
[1:14:33] first theory says he comes forth to call
[1:14:35] his subjects
[1:14:37] how is he going to claim them he's
[1:14:40] already got a book of redemption
[1:14:42] in his hand
[1:14:45] when that mighty angel in revelations 10
[1:14:48] comes down
[1:14:49] what's in his hand an
[1:14:52] open book now the king comes and he's
[1:14:56] looking for a queen he's coming for his
[1:14:59] redeemed subjects
[1:15:00] how's he going to call him he's already
[1:15:03] got the book of redemption in his hand
[1:15:06] how is he going to find the queen he's
[1:15:08] already got the book of redemption in
[1:15:10] his hand
[1:15:12] do you get it yet
[1:15:16] he goes over to the goats
[1:15:22] they just look at the book they sniff it
[1:15:26] they might lick it then they turn away
[1:15:29] and go some other direction
[1:15:31] he comes over here to the cattle and
[1:15:34] he's approaching to the cattle
[1:15:36] mighty angel christ open book in his
[1:15:40] hand
[1:15:41] comes to the cattle they look at it
[1:15:45] he moves around to where their head is
[1:15:48] you know christ doesn't force feed
[1:15:49] anybody the holy spirit's a gentleman
[1:15:53] he'll just present the truth here's the
[1:15:55] book
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:01] they turn and go another direction he
[1:16:03] takes it to the camels
[1:16:05] amen he takes it to all the beasts of
[1:16:08] the field
[1:16:09] but then one day he steps in front of a
[1:16:11] sheep
[1:16:14] and the sheep rips it out of his hands
[1:16:16] and gobbles it up
[1:16:18] what's he doing he's a king looking for
[1:16:20] his queen
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:26] the prophet the angel that was with john
[1:16:29] tells john
[1:16:31] when he sees the mighty angel with the
[1:16:32] book in his hand john sees it
[1:16:34] john sees the mighty angel comes down
[1:16:36] here's the roar of the lot like
[1:16:37] like a lion roar and he's looking down
[1:16:39] and he sees him with his hand but john's
[1:16:41] not quite sure what to do
[1:16:46] but this messenger that's with john
[1:16:49] says go and take the book
[1:16:54] that's out that's in the hand of the
[1:16:56] angel
[1:16:58] so john goes to take the book
[1:17:01] and what does john say oh please angel
[1:17:04] sir
[1:17:05] if you could be so kind could i please
[1:17:08] maybe
[1:17:08] touch the book sniff the book flip a few
[1:17:11] pages of the book
[1:17:13] no john has already caught a revelation
[1:17:15] because the prophet of god says john
[1:17:17] caught a revelation that his name was in
[1:17:18] the book
[1:17:19] why was john shouting when the lamb took
[1:17:21] the book why was he shouting a fit that
[1:17:23] everybody in heaven
[1:17:25] everybody on earth and everybody under
[1:17:27] the earth heard him praising and
[1:17:28] worshiping god
[1:17:29] is because he realized that's his
[1:17:31] redemption he realized his name was in
[1:17:33] the book
[1:17:34] now john couldn't have looked over and
[1:17:35] actually read it brother bram said he
[1:17:36] must have read his name
[1:17:37] he couldn't because it was still sealed
[1:17:39] in his hand it doesn't come sealed till
[1:17:40] the six
[1:17:41] unsealed till the sixth chapter but he
[1:17:43] looks at it in something in john he
[1:17:45] realizes
[1:17:46] my name's in that book that's my
[1:17:48] redemption i'm part of that book
[1:17:50] and he already caught a revelation of
[1:17:52] where he belonged
[1:17:53] mighty angel comes down holding the book
[1:17:55] the voice tells him go take the book
[1:17:57] and he doesn't walk up and beg for it
[1:17:59] why doesn't he beg for it because he's
[1:18:00] in it
[1:18:02] if he's in it it's his
[1:18:06] he goes up and he says give me
[1:18:10] that book
[1:18:14] give me that book
[1:18:18] caleb he saw a mountain he wanted
[1:18:23] he went out and spied the land and he
[1:18:24] found a good place
[1:18:27] and you know the best pieces of ground
[1:18:30] are already already taken
[1:18:32] always already taken how many times you
[1:18:34] drive by a piece of ground oh i love
[1:18:35] that piece of crap oh it's sold of
[1:18:36] course it's sold it's a good piece of
[1:18:38] ground
[1:18:40] caleb sees a piece of ground and he
[1:18:41] really likes it only it's got giants on
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:46] it's got the sons of anakin on it all
[1:18:49] right
[1:18:50] he goes back in these other 10 worthless
[1:18:52] spies with no vision
[1:18:54] they say we can't take the land we can't
[1:18:56] do it and
[1:18:58] only him and joshua say we're more than
[1:18:59] able because of the word
[1:19:02] what's he standing on he's not looking
[1:19:04] down on his muscles right
[1:19:05] he's not looking at the length of his
[1:19:06] sword he says it's been promised
[1:19:08] he already told us we're more than able
[1:19:10] to take it it has nothing to do with
[1:19:12] caleb it has nothing to do with joshua
[1:19:14] has everything to do with god
[1:19:17] that's what the world has forgotten he's
[1:19:19] looking for a queen
[1:19:20] that pleaseth him
[1:19:24] we have totally lost our mind
[1:19:27] because the world is looking for a god
[1:19:29] that pleases them
[1:19:31] a god of my own choosing a god of my own
[1:19:34] desire
[1:19:34] a god that his affections my affections
[1:19:37] and his desires
[1:19:37] match my desires so now we've got a
[1:19:41] queen a woman trying to go
[1:19:43] grab a man and say give me your name
[1:19:47] but that's not how the queen's coming
[1:19:48] into power that's not the rise of the
[1:19:50] queen
[1:19:51] the rise of the queen is going to be the
[1:19:53] one that pleaseth
[1:19:55] him didn't say anything about what
[1:19:58] pleased esther do you ever notice that
[1:20:00] it never says one thing not one time
[1:20:04] does it talk about in her choosing in
[1:20:06] her preparation
[1:20:08] and are going to meet the king you know
[1:20:09] it never one time says what esther wants
[1:20:12] because what's more important what
[1:20:14] esther wants or what the king wants
[1:20:16] but we flipped our doctrine in this age
[1:20:19] where it's not about the king anymore
[1:20:20] now it's about me
[1:20:25] surely he'll accept little old
[1:20:28] me and trample over his word
[1:20:31] you're wrong he won't choose you he
[1:20:34] won't select you
[1:20:35] he won't unite to you he won't put a
[1:20:37] seed in you
[1:20:38] why because you have to please him
[1:20:41] not him please you you don't choose him
[1:20:44] he chooses you show me anywhere in the
[1:20:48] scripture says anything different than
[1:20:49] that
[1:20:52] so caleb was spying out the land these
[1:20:54] worthless spies they ruined it for him
[1:20:56] and so now he's got to wait 40 more
[1:21:00] years but moses tells him
[1:21:05] you can have that land that great
[1:21:08] mountain that you saw
[1:21:09] amen where the cities were and all the
[1:21:12] fruits and the vegetables and the
[1:21:14] it's yours all right so when they come
[1:21:17] into the land
[1:21:20] caleb goes up to joshua which is a type
[1:21:22] of the holy ghost
[1:21:24] because the holy ghost positionally
[1:21:26] places the people in the land
[1:21:27] we're positionally placed in the word
[1:21:29] and it's the holy ghost who tells us our
[1:21:30] position in the word
[1:21:32] so he goes to the holy ghost and caleb
[1:21:34] now remember
[1:21:36] caleb is a gentile
[1:21:39] his name is dog
[1:21:44] he's a gentile but he's a proselyte jew
[1:21:47] after several generations he's been
[1:21:49] grafted
[1:21:50] in to the tribe of
[1:21:54] judah
[1:21:57] grafted into the tribe of judah you know
[1:22:00] what we happen to be
[1:22:01] gentiles that were called dogs by the
[1:22:03] jews
[1:22:04] who have been grafted in by marriage to
[1:22:06] witch tribe
[1:22:08] judah because jesus sprang from judah
[1:22:10] we've been united to christ so by
[1:22:12] marriage we've been grafted into
[1:22:14] judah what's this story about caleb is
[1:22:18] it about caleb no it's about you
[1:22:20] it's about me it's a story of redemption
[1:22:23] all over again
[1:22:25] the gentile grafted into judah
[1:22:28] the dog oh i don't care what you call me
[1:22:32] call me a blasphemer call me a heretic
[1:22:35] tell me i'm off on the word
[1:22:36] but i know i know what's been promised
[1:22:39] to me in that land
[1:22:43] the rest of the spy is going to look
[1:22:44] caleb you're not even a real jew
[1:22:47] caleb didn't care caleb caught the
[1:22:49] revelation
[1:22:51] the rest of them failed so caleb goes to
[1:22:54] joshua the holy ghost
[1:22:56] and he doesn't say please sir may i yeah
[1:22:59] he doesn't say if it be okay
[1:23:02] if it would be according to your will
[1:23:03] and according to your kindness and not
[1:23:05] so bad
[1:23:05] and maybe a possibility that i could
[1:23:07] have what i want
[1:23:09] no he saw it already promised by a
[1:23:12] prophet
[1:23:13] moses had already told him it was his so
[1:23:16] he knew
[1:23:16] it didn't belong to joshua it didn't
[1:23:19] belong to any other
[1:23:20] tribe it didn't belong to any other
[1:23:21] church it belonged
[1:23:23] to him him it was his promise in the
[1:23:27] word
[1:23:27] it was his promise that was given to him
[1:23:29] by a prophet and he went up to joshua he
[1:23:31] says
[1:23:31] give me my mountain
[1:23:38] he's got poor etiquette his manners are
[1:23:41] atrocious
[1:23:42] he never said please and i don't
[1:23:43] remember hearing him say thank you
[1:23:46] because it was his he knew it was his
[1:23:50] he was already revealed to him it was
[1:23:52] his he was only claiming
[1:23:54] what was already his and so now the
[1:23:57] mighty angel comes with the book of
[1:23:58] redemption
[1:24:01] john already knows it's his
[1:24:05] so he comes to the angel and he says
[1:24:08] give me
[1:24:09] that book now the angel says
[1:24:13] take it and eat it
[1:24:16] all up
[1:24:20] eat it all up
[1:24:24] and in my belly it'll be bitter but in
[1:24:26] my mouth in my mouth it'll be sweet
[1:24:29] as honey now
[1:24:32] what would have happened if john had
[1:24:34] taken the book
[1:24:36] and been a little bit nervous about the
[1:24:37] bitter part
[1:24:40] and said i'm just going to take a little
[1:24:42] sample
[1:24:45] and i'm going to wait 24 hours and see
[1:24:46] what happens
[1:24:49] why do people come in the message and
[1:24:50] bail right back out
[1:24:54] why do people hang around for a little
[1:24:55] bit and jump ship they're just
[1:24:58] i just want to see what happens i just
[1:25:01] want to
[1:25:02] i want to see how bad it gets i want to
[1:25:05] see
[1:25:06] how bitter my belly really is
[1:25:09] oh that is bitter persecution and
[1:25:13] rejection and
[1:25:14] called names and family members think
[1:25:16] you went off the deep end and
[1:25:18] all kinds of other stuff amen
[1:25:22] and because it's bitter in the belly we
[1:25:23] jump ship
[1:25:25] but guess what it was too late for john
[1:25:27] to jump ship because before the
[1:25:29] bitterness hit his belly
[1:25:30] he had already ate it all up
[1:25:33] amen and the commandment isn't to nibble
[1:25:35] on this word
[1:25:36] the commandment isn't just to try it for
[1:25:38] a little while just to taste and see
[1:25:40] the commandment is to eat it all up
[1:25:44] the hard stuff the stuff you don't
[1:25:46] understand the things that look like
[1:25:48] contradictions the things that baffle
[1:25:49] your mind
[1:25:50] eat it all up
[1:25:55] and guess what in your belly
[1:25:58] it'll be bitter
[1:26:01] but that's okay because peter
[1:26:04] or paul told timothy
[1:26:08] timothy don't drink water only but why
[1:26:11] don't you take a little
[1:26:12] wine for your stomach's sake
[1:26:18] brother bam taught us that wine is the
[1:26:20] stimulation
[1:26:21] of revelation you want a cure for the
[1:26:24] bitterness in your belly
[1:26:25] you get a good heaping dose of
[1:26:26] stimulation of revelation
[1:26:28] you let god open your eyes at what this
[1:26:30] word is in your position in this word
[1:26:32] and it doesn't matter about the
[1:26:33] bitterness anymore because now i've got
[1:26:35] a whine
[1:26:36] i've got a revelation of what this is
[1:26:38] that makes me so happy
[1:26:41] brother branham says you ever see a
[1:26:43] drunk man he's happy
[1:26:46] he can fall in the ditch he could be
[1:26:47] soaking wet he could be cut and bruised
[1:26:49] people could be making fun of him but
[1:26:50] he's still
[1:26:51] singing because he caught the revelation
[1:26:55] he got the stimulation of the wine
[1:26:57] in our stimulation of the wine we can be
[1:27:00] cut and bruised and rejected and
[1:27:01] cast stones at and called all kinds of
[1:27:04] names it doesn't matter
[1:27:05] because if i'm drinking of the wine of
[1:27:07] revelation i'm happy
[1:27:09] and i'm still singing as i go along oh
[1:27:12] they might be chucking rocks at me
[1:27:13] and i'm so drunk on the word of god so
[1:27:16] stimulated by the revelation
[1:27:18] of who i am in christ that i can just
[1:27:20] sing
[1:27:21] hallelujah i can sing
[1:27:24] chuck a rock at me whizzes by my ear
[1:27:26] call me a heretic
[1:27:27] say i don't even know nothing about the
[1:27:29] bible and i say oh
[1:27:30] happy day oh happy day
[1:27:37] hallelujah there's a cure for the
[1:27:40] bitterness in your belly
[1:27:42] and it's the stimulation of revelation
[1:27:44] that comes from the father
[1:27:46] amen he's come with an open book
[1:27:51] what's he doing he's the king
[1:27:54] looking for a queen
[1:27:58] are you the queen that's going to unite
[1:28:01] with the king
[1:28:03] then take the book and eat it up
[1:28:07] the book isn't for anyone but the bride
[1:28:12] he said these mysteries will only
[1:28:15] be revealed to his bride
[1:28:18] it's the love letter it's the
[1:28:21] stimulation
[1:28:23] of revelation let's all stand
[1:28:31] amen it's a happy day
[1:28:39] brother branham says i just want to i
[1:28:41] just want to close with this a final
[1:28:43] thought as we walk away
[1:28:45] he said does god ever change his mind
[1:28:46] about his word
[1:28:49] he said you can't judge god by
[1:28:50] prosperity the world prospers
[1:28:53] balaam prospers by it but brother you
[1:28:55] judge god by his word
[1:28:57] he keeps his word and identifies it the
[1:28:59] truth
[1:29:00] so remember friend as long as you live
[1:29:02] don't you never forget this
[1:29:04] god doesn't change his mind yet he will
[1:29:06] bless
[1:29:07] he will let you go his permissive will
[1:29:10] why
[1:29:11] because they could take whatever they
[1:29:12] wanted out of the house of the women
[1:29:15] he never takes that option away
[1:29:18] amen he never takes his permissive will
[1:29:21] but he won't change his mind
[1:29:24] he won't change his plan he won't change
[1:29:26] his word for you
[1:29:28] no sir you've got to change
[1:29:34] esther wasn't there to change the king's
[1:29:36] mind
[1:29:38] esther wasn't in the house of the women
[1:29:40] for sanctification and purification
[1:29:42] she wasn't there under the tudor ship of
[1:29:43] haggai so that she could change the
[1:29:45] king's mind
[1:29:46] she was there under the tutelage of
[1:29:48] haggai so that
[1:29:49] she could be changed to match the king's
[1:29:52] desire
[1:29:53] this prophet of god came to prepare a
[1:29:55] bride for a rapture amen
[1:29:56] he came to get her clothed in the
[1:29:58] wedding garment he came to produce the
[1:30:00] purification word he came for everything
[1:30:02] why because he's here to change us to
[1:30:04] match his desire
[1:30:06] that's something the world has lost
[1:30:08] sight of we forget who we're worshiping
[1:30:10] and start worshiping ourselves
[1:30:12] you've got to change you can't have
[1:30:14] god's word to match your experience
[1:30:16] you've got to have your experience match
[1:30:18] god's word see that's the way you've got
[1:30:20] you say well i'm a good man god does
[1:30:22] this that or the other
[1:30:23] but do you keep his word
[1:30:29] that was the key for esther
[1:30:33] that was the character that the king was
[1:30:36] looking for
[1:30:38] he comes with a book in his hand
[1:30:42] what are you going to do about it
[1:30:46] he's come with the revelation of the
[1:30:48] seven seals
[1:30:51] he's opened the word he showed us the
[1:30:52] full mystery of redemptions complete
[1:30:54] and now it's available you know what he
[1:30:57] never shows you what he's doing while
[1:30:59] he's doing it
[1:31:00] he always shows us after he's done
[1:31:04] what about paying the price of
[1:31:06] redemption he's going to show us while
[1:31:07] he's doing it or after he's done
[1:31:09] what about atonement while he's doing it
[1:31:10] or after it's done he come down on the
[1:31:12] seven seals the opening seven seals to
[1:31:14] show us
[1:31:14] what he's already done
[1:31:19] now my question is this is a question
[1:31:21] only you can answer in your heart
[1:31:23] what does that mean to me
[1:31:29] because he's coming to call his redeemed
[1:31:30] subjects but how's he going to call him
[1:31:33] he comes with the book of redemption in
[1:31:35] his hand
[1:31:37] you mean if i'm his redeemed subject
[1:31:39] that that book of redemption is going to
[1:31:41] mean something to me you mean if i'm the
[1:31:44] queen
[1:31:45] it's not just you know sweet jesus loves
[1:31:48] everybody he loves you he loves me we're
[1:31:50] all going to heaven
[1:31:51] no that's not the message that calls the
[1:31:53] bride that's not the message that close
[1:31:55] the bride
[1:31:55] it's more than that is the message just
[1:31:58] something that your friends go to
[1:32:00] is the message something your parents go
[1:32:01] to it's a message something you're here
[1:32:03] with your wife
[1:32:04] or your husband just so you don't break
[1:32:05] up a home
[1:32:08] is it here because these are nice people
[1:32:09] is it here because this is a nice
[1:32:10] building
[1:32:11] is that what we're here for if that's
[1:32:12] what you're here for then it's not for
[1:32:14] you
[1:32:16] i don't mean to be rude but it's not for
[1:32:17] you if that book of life does not mean
[1:32:20] more than life itself to you then it's
[1:32:22] not for you if you're not willing to
[1:32:24] walk up to that mighty angel and said
[1:32:25] give me
[1:32:26] that book give me my mountain
[1:32:29] you know why caleb called for that
[1:32:31] mountain you know what he knew was on
[1:32:32] the mountain
[1:32:33] giants he knew there were giants on the
[1:32:35] mountain you know what
[1:32:36] he knew it was going to be bitter in his
[1:32:37] belly but he didn't care
[1:32:39] he didn't care about the fight he didn't
[1:32:41] care about the rejection
[1:32:43] he didn't care about the troubles all he
[1:32:45] cared about was his inheritance
[1:32:47] amen if you care about something more
[1:32:49] than your inheritance in the word of god
[1:32:52] something more than your position in
[1:32:53] christ then it's not for you
[1:32:57] but if that book of life
[1:33:01] if that open book thrills your soul
[1:33:05] if that word of haggai preparing you to
[1:33:07] meet the king
[1:33:09] and all the talk of the king and in the
[1:33:11] new jerusalem
[1:33:13] if that thrills your soul it's for you
[1:33:17] if you're willing to eat all the book
[1:33:19] then it's for you if you enjoy
[1:33:23] while you're eating it's sweet as honey
[1:33:25] in your mouth
[1:33:26] it's for you when the bitterness hits
[1:33:30] your belly
[1:33:30] and you cry out for the stimulation of
[1:33:33] revelation and get happy again

[1:33:54] evidence
