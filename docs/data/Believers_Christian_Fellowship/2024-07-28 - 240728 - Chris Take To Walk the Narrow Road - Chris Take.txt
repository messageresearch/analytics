is my cup f it up and may amen is that your desire this morning you know I just been thinking about that portion of scripture David says my cup over floweth the more of Christ we can pour into the cup the more of our elves flow out and the more of ourselves that flow out the more we see a reflection of him in our lives cuz that's the goal that's the goal why did Enoch translate completion right I said one time too much word and that was that was a question mark at first and I said no you have to understand so much word the flesh can't hold you back anymore that's my desire that's been my desire since a a young man and uh was baptized at at 9 years old and and uh you know as a teenager so you had to remember teenagers don't always know what's going on themselves but I thank the Lord I always cherish the word which is why I ran from being a preacher for so long because the word is such a sacred responsibility amen so we thank you for having us here bring greetings from our pastor brother Paul and Grace Tabernacle and of course greetings from the dean hearts they said oh they there's we love those people so much tell them we said hello so uh we make sure we are responsible for that passing that greetings on Amen thank you brother Blake and musicians just enjoyed that this morning if you have your Bibles and you wouldn't mind turning with me to Isaiah chapter 35 amen like brother Chad said my wife is here and um back there in the corner with her son Alistair and so happy that she could come with me and we're just we just love the Lord we love the word I mean we really love the word I can't think of anything better to do than I my and we'll read here so you can be seated but my greatest uh what what makes me so happy for eternity is the fact that for eternity Christ will be revealing himself because the the the most precious moments in my life is when I open the book and God shows me another part of himself I hadn't seen before nothing gets me more excited nothing gets me more inspired than that and realizing that that get going to happen for eternity I think that's what what heaven means to me Isaiah CH 35 verse one we are going to read the the whole chapter here the Wilderness and the solitary Place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as the rose it shall Blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing The Glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of the Lord and the Excellency of our God strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a fe fearful heart be strong and fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the death death shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as an heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall Waters break out and streams in the desert and parched ground shall become a pool and the Thirsty land Springs of water in the habitation of dragon dragons where each lay shall be the grass with reeds and rushes and in Highway shall be there and a away and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not he therein no lion shall be there nor any ravenous Beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there so it's hidden amen and The Ransom of the the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting Joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you know our desire this morning Father though we are from different places Lord we we all have the same father we all have the same original position in you Lord and we just want you to come this morning and speak to our hearts Lord Jesus as your word would be broken in our midst may you just feed our souls Lord may you may you lift us to a higher plane Lord A A Closer Walk with You Lord that we would see you father again today we ask we love you Lord we commit all these things into your hands Lord may you have your way we pray in jesus' name amen you can be seated so I wanted to take my textt this morning from verse 8 says and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men and brother bam says that in the unfailing realities of the Living God he says it it does in you just like it did in Christ I love that because that was his purpose of coming to bring God to man and made God and man one that's the message but we took denominations and run him out see too much of man pushes God away that's why the the key to to Christ's Ministry on Earth the key was he was completely harnessed to the will of the father that's all he did he walked into the the pool of Bethesda I believe it was hundreds of people there Desiring to be healed and the disciples no doubt thought this is the moment we'll show the world who this man really is and he goes and he heals a man who who was sick and he he you know was sick for years but he wasn't on death's door he goes he heals him and he walks out Jesus was a man of compassion do you think that was easy you see but he was perfect in flesh because he was not born of a man born of a woman so he couldn't fail but he knew the pole he felt the pole the struggle of those Desiring they a lot of them probably heard the news about Jesus heard people being healed and here he was and he goes just to the man because that's what the father wanted the perfect will of God is the the best place that we can be the perfect will of God is a the manifestation of God's word in flesh because his word is his will that's what the prophet says so he took denominations and run him out he goes on to say took Creeds and run him out now we're on the bypass over here but there's a real true highway so there's a real Highway we can all agree there's a real Highway he says it goes deeper than that he says and a way in the highway so there's a road there's a road that is is right but there's a way in that road that is pure there's a way in that road that is perfection so my title this morning is to walk the narrow road I'd like to take the subject of a transition from church to bride and so the Lord just help us and we'll just Feast around his table this morning and and uh we'll hear what he has to say he goes on to saying the same quote a little bit further down same message he says when Jacob and Esau was born they were both born of a Holy Father and a holy mother but they were twins one a carnal man religious went to church was a good man very good Jacob was a little Shyer but he had his mind on one thing so God never excused Jacob's Behavior he had to pay for his behavior we have to pay for our Behavior but it's not the the Perfection of the conduct or the Perfection of how we how we look and how we know the quotes and we can we can act the part it's what is inside of our soul in our hearts that's what God's God is looking at when Samuel goes to choose the next King The King that God chose he goes through all of the men the of David's Brothers surely one of these is you know tall strong handsome you know this this guy he's a good leader he's got a strong arm and Jesus Christ spoke to said nope none of those because only one of the brothers had what brother was going to say here had on his mind one thing you see you can't you can't give that you are you are destined with that to to have one thing that you desire above above that's what that's what that was the heart of Christ of Jesus he had one thing and you see that at the at the at the the peak the the the the Crux of his life he says not my will Lord but yours be done if I will bear I will drink the cup and that every every believer we have to come to that point a lot over and over and over again and and the deciding factor or the or the the the the the portion that that separates the elect from God from non-elect is they had in their mind that one thing that one thing he says he says that Birthright meant everything to him no matter how he had to get it yeah so so his flesh wasn't manifesting a Son of God his behavior was wasn't was was wrong you know I mean he just his father-in-law cheats him so he cheats his father-in-law back and and th and then this is the man that that had respect for the birthright but God knew he would straighten up that's right God knew that that one thing that he had would begin to to Bud forth would begin to to push out on now getting somewhere begin to push out see you can't you can't hold that back because do you know do you know that Darkness isn't a thing it's not a substance fear is not a substance faith is a substance light is a substance so as light comes forth Darkness has but no choice to move away so God took Jacob and he grinded him down he put a man before him who was just like him we say that all the time he says boy this this brother just man I just I I want to love him and I want but and it your wife's or you know somebody who's real close to you it's say well you know you act just like him see God will put somebody before you that's a mirror to show you that's that's your behavior that's right and when you look in the glass Darkly you don't want to see Jacob you want to see Israel you want to see a man of God you want to see a sister of Christ right you want to be in that position so Jacob had to God put him through the the pressure put him through this to manifest what was inside of him that desire for the birthright that desire to hold that to hold that position in the family of God he says because the Bible said that he was elected before the foundation of the world to look to that cuz predestination is is goes back to for knowledge so God knew the choices you were making you would make and that's predestination he knew you would go for that because he put something in you to go for that he says and today there's people I don't care how much popularity they have to to use or how much they have to lose is what he's saying or what they have to do makes no difference to them if they're called old-fashioned no mother no matter what they are they got their eyes on Christ because they were elected to eternal life and they plant right there on that if it takes everything if it takes everything they got they plant right there is it is it a is it a location on planet Earth right no it's it's a it's a it's a resting place of your faith in God's word all that that rock which is revelation of who Christ is so he says the other is a nominal man he goes to church and he feels just as good as the rest of them goes home see that's that's the Esau like see and the other one is Jacob like now there you are both sides and he says something a little further down and and to me the last few line few words of this line just really spoke to my heart when I was in study stud night inside of me I was running around in circles he says what I can't understand it is why would people want to get some old ecclesiastical weeds but he says when the rock is full of honey I mean I wanted to to write that on the walls of my office when the RO the rock is full of Honey to me that just that's just a bomb on my soul the that the rock is full of honey so so we see here that within the highway there's there's a way there's a there's a higher way and and and the desire that we have in us to to reach Perfection we're not perfect you know we're are we still here okay we're still here so we haven't reached that point uh that point but that's our goal and and and Perfection is our is our goal Perfection meaning the full manifestation of the word of God in our lives and there there's a road you can walk you can you Esau was there he was walking he was he was partaking but there's something deeper in the word there's there's a there's more to the word and Christ came in in in our day and in his in his revealing of himself there was a there was a transition right and and what he was doing was he was transitioning and and for brother brandham being here when he was here that message was was for a later people and he Faithfully stood there he taught that but what what is God doing God's Desiring to bring a bride from the church so there's a highway and there's a way so there has to be a separating point and and you can the simple the simple part of that is that separation is the is the desire for the one thing the desire for the birthright and what that desire does is it pulls you it it pulls you right into the way but as you pull into the way you you you you you have says the road the W rain washes the trash on either side so you have things on either side that are distracting that's right and sometimes sometimes we we stop looking down down the road my wife my wife gets me for this all the time because we do a lot of traveling in by by car and you're not looking at the road you hit the rumble strip right but sometimes you get your eye off of where you're going but but the desire in your heart for that thing for to line up with God's word it's that desire that pulls you into the way and we are called to walk the narrow road and but this the so the disciples here we'll go to Luke 24 verse 13 and the disciples here they are they they they have this this this man Jesus you who do who do men say that I am but who who do you say that that I am Peter says Thou Art the son of God they were testifying there there was Miracles I I want you to put yourself in their shoes which technically in this day and age you are in their shoes but really think about this because I think by God's grace we we can bring this down home to an important part of our lives this here's the Messiah and and people are starting to realize it's the Messiah 5,000 are fed and I think it was 7,000 or another another many thousands fed Miracles and and and you can read you can find it in the early which I don't remember which gospel it was but you can find it brother or brother brandom Jesus had a prayer line and just healed all the sick it said that came to him so this this is going out and I know there's so much in here we could hit but we're we're trying not to get too too far down a money Trail but this is the man then there's I mean there's 70 or more walking with him and and the disciples and and they're going and then they go he Jesus sends the disciples to go preach and and heal and and deliver and all this and they come back saying my goodness the devils are subject to us and he says he says no no no no no he says Rejoice cuz your name's written in heaven okay so there was something about them and he's he's he's trying to point them and and he begins to work on them right through the word he drops things to them along the way and they're oblivious that's right because God has a God's Will has a time and the season that's right so they come and and here's Jesus then then all of a sudden he says unless you eat my flesh or drink my blood you have no part with me right now there's a separation so the 70 said we you know we can't do this anymore and and and Peter is probably there thinking man this is really bad for the campaign we're going to lose a lot of reviews that's right and and and it was a struggle from then you know he couldn't even go to Jerusalem and then when it came time he went and he goes and the disciples are are saying you know I don't think this is a good idea they want to kill you because the disciples had a a vision right you see we we we'll get to a place we got a vision is that vision wrong in in in its motives maybe not but the objective was Christ had something he needed to do that's right he needed to pull a bride from the church that's right and in order to do that he had to lay himself completely down he had to he had to fulfill redemption's plan he he could hear Adam calling he he thought of Eve he thought of you but the joy that was set before him amen but the disciples were very confused and he has a Passover with them and and he breaks bread and he and he and he and they have communion the first communion and they they wash the he washes their feet and and they go to the Garden you know he goes to the cross and he and he dies on the cross and he's buried in the Tomb and you we've all been there on our Christian walk where God begins to reveal something to us but other things around us pull from that and if we're not careful we we start to question it because of the outside pressure but God is so faithful and he keeps pointing you back this this this and everything you know disagrees with this but there's something in your heart that says I can't let it go so here the disciples are and they they're they they're sitting around saying they're afraid you know we're next and they're sitting around and and they're saying woman were we wrong no Peter Noah we were right I I know this man is is who he said he was and and and and then the outside world saying look just another crazy prophet and he's dead everything the church you have to remember that they grew up with the church they they were there they were so it's it's really close it's a Razor's Edge right so there they are and and but something in their heart keeps saying it's it's I I just I thought it was a truth it's got to be the truth you know one side of their flesh says look buddy you lost your mind go back to the fish but some in his in their hearts kept testifying back saying it's true it's true and you would think you know in that process that that somehow they would go back to what Jesus said I mean he was pretty pointed the son of man will go on the earth three days rise again and you think they would go back but you see what happens is is the devil first of all just so you remember the devil can't do nothing that God doesn't allow that's right cuz God loves to put the pressure on his people he sees your faith and he tests your faith he saw job's Faith so he tested job to the Perfection of job not to prove a point to the devil but to bring a perfection in job even more see job thought he was we would look at job's life and we would say my goodness what a man of God but God said no there's more to bring out in job so here the disciples are and and um more to more to bring I went on the story of job and I don't remember where I was but so Luke Luke 24 we'll just jump right back to my notes and and then God will bring it back to us Luke 24:13 so here do you have here you have the disciples and and two of them decide you know we're going to we're going to walk down to emus which is from Jerusalem about three score furlongs verse 14 and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commun together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was Copus answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel but we trusted so so here they are in this place and and sometimes you just you just you need a you you need a you need to take a walk you need to take a drive or you know you need you need to you need to you need some movement you need some Direction so they said well we'll go down to emus why I don't know because as soon as Jesus broke bread they went back so what they were doing down there I'm not sure but maybe amas had a nice a nice coffee shop you maybe they had a world class cinnamon roll or something and so they they were walking just let's just you know hey you know Copus let's let's go for a walk let's walk on down and you see God is is is the the amazing part to me is how faithful God is because these are his children but he's putting them to the test and and and and Jesus who they thought you see have to remember who they thought but they still knew they thought we we trusted that this was the man but there was still something in their heart that couldn't let go of it if it was they would have just been like the 70 and be like wow we were really wrong let's go find something else to do but they couldn't let Let It Go that's right Jacob he couldn't let the he couldn't let it go he had to get the birthright by whatever means necessary and so here are these men and they're call of God and and they're on the road which is kind of where our text comes from too they're on the road and it's and it's on the road that that Jesus comes now now they had already heard Peter had ran to the selr and there was a the sisters that come back and said you know he's alive Peter and John they run to the SRE and the body's not there and and they're still confused that's right they're still confused because the only way that you can understand amen that you can have Revelation is when God speaks to you that's why he had to come back come back to them he could have just resurrected and went into Glory you see he doesn't need to prove anything but he needed he had some some some men and some Women of Faith who needed a revelation see so he he completed redemption's plan and he went back to them he came to them and he said look he he says well you know he walks up to them why are you sad and you see I love this because he didn't just walk up and say it's me he himself God in flesh used his own word to reveal himself to them see God doesn't break his pattern God doesn't you're you're looking at the word in flesh I'm looking at the word in flesh but how are you revealed through the word not you coming and saying look at me by your fruits you shall know them it's a fruit of the mouth the fruit of the life what it what what identifies you is your word who you are is identified by Your Word so Jesus he's standing there and he begins to speak to them and and I would have loved to sit in on that sermon he started in he started in oh help me where's my spot he says oh fools verse 25 oh fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken on not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself so Jesus in flesh Christ in flesh goes to the word and from the word begins to speak to them and from the word begins to open up himself to them you know that you they were the first ones and and and and and it comes to this place where they they get to where they're going and and he's he fakes like he's going to go on they said no no no or he acts like he's going to walk on he says no no no come have come sit with us and what does he do he breaks bread sir Passover he broke the bread with the two on the road to maze he broke the bread and in our day how do you how do you come to that position it's a Breaking of the bread it's an opening of the word because he says I am the bread of life and we know that if he says he's the bread of life we can go to John where says in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the word was God so the word of God is the bread of life but unless it's broken you see they didn't slice bread back then they broke it open unless it's broken open then their eyes were opened you see God had the desire to to he he saw you he saw you in this place of of confusion he saw you with a desire to to to go deeper be see they were already followers of Jesus they were already followers of Jesus so they're already walking along the highway but there was a way in the highway and and and so God wanted to transition them to this position this position this this this place on the highway called the way why did he need them there he needed them there because there's that's the way to Christ that is the way to eternal life that is the way and he wants he wants us more than we want him he wants us to be a part of him to to spend eternity with him more than we even want that and the way is how you get there the way is and and it and it's it's it's a narrow way it's a straight way it's a hard way the disciples they had to go against everything he was asking them to believe something that was impossible that's right they didn't understand it break eat my flesh drink my blood I don't know but this is the thing this is the one thing that speaks to my heart this man holds the truth I don't understand what you're saying but I hold to the fact that you are the truth and then God then he comes and he reveals himself through them or into them through them too but you see he he he was he was he was asking them they're they're in the upper room they're on the road to EMAs he's he's asking them believe I have come back to life believe that I that I am returned believe that and to them it seemed impossible it seemed impossible but you see God comes in that transition and he showed himself personally to all of them to the two on the road to emus and he comes back and and he's there in the room with them and um it's in it's it's that it's that period of time where where there's where there's where that there's a transition and and sometimes in that space of time we we know it's the truth things are pulling back from it but something in our heart says I think no this is this is the truth and in that moment God comes directly to you lest you lest you falter or lest you miss the mark he comes directly to you and shows himself to you personally so in in in Matthew 3:3 we're going to read here I just it's just this scripture here you can turn if you'd like I'm sorry I go through a lot of water when I preach says for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and make his path straight so there had to come preparation for the transition there had to come a Ministry to point to prepare the way not the highway the way you see there's always you see God but there's always more of God there's always a deeper part of God like the back part of his mind right that's a deep that's a deeper place and and when you say deeper not more complicated further in the more you go into Christ the simpler Christ becomes you go deeper not more mysterious not more mystical but further into Christ because the goal is to what the more Christ you get the less flesh you deal with that's why he said the rapturing faith is laying in the word because it is a word himself word himself revealing to you and as it reveals to you one day there's not going to be any room for anything but word and we are creatures of light time and matter and word is eternal so you can't hold this Dimension Can't Hold Back eternity right now we're we're holding you know we're holding it back if you if you could say that you understand God has his plan so the more you the more you take of the Eternal the less finite you become which the world says that's pretty strange but brother re says there's an eternal quality to the elect so something inside of you something inside of you grows well that's that's eternity growing inside of you because you have an eternal quality so there's something already in you that can connect to Eternity right you see your theophany is your Eternal version of yourself and so much word light light word is light the word of God is the light of Life did you know that light if you could speed up to the to the speed of light time would stand still it's a theory of relativity but light itself the particles of light photons they never die in this world we live in light the photon particle of light according to science and I and I quote has an existence of an eternal now and he says I am the light of life and you are the light of the world right sir so there's an eternal quality to the elect that's right not only spiritually but physically cuz you're you're a creature of light so as the word comes and energizes that something begins to speed up the Bible says Redeeming the time you see God is outside of time God is not bound by time and we say we say oh we are the thoughts of God expressed but Mar says the thoughts of God are not like a man's blueprint where he says okay now it's time to put the banister there he says God thoughts and I paraphrase are not potentially substance they are currently substance so when we say you are the thought of God expressed we're saying now the thought of God has been manifested in time that's right so his thought was always there you were always there in him that's right I mean the world is time is unfolding beneath Vis it that way maybe that's not correct but just God looking at time and time is manifesting and then he puts you into a spot you always were a thought right your life with him eternally is currently substance that's right because eternity and you being the bride sitting up there with Christ on the throne is a thought of God but it's not potentially substance it is currently substance right the sons of God were gathered around and the the Lord asks the devil what have you been doing job up there with them sons of God and job manifested in time so while there Devil's looking over there and you think he would catch a clue and say well I don't got a chance cuz there's job already you see but the devil's going to try his hard as he can any any being that will fight against God himself you know there's there's something not quite right upstairs but but you see you you your your position in Christ is not potential it is current in God's mind and and and in order for you to reach that point I and sometimes I feel like to get to the point of a sermon it's almost like it's a little bit hid sometimes and you can't quite say it exactly verbatim how you want to because God wants you to catch a revelation of it so we just yield to the anointing of the Lord and he'll speak to you and he'll deal with you and you will hear what you need to hear to go further on in your journey so it's it's it's a position you hold right now you say but I'm in a dead body doesn't matter that's right doesn't matter if you are a part of God you hold that position already so your theophany is waiting for you he's uh you speed up the next Dimension is just a little bit faster right well if you speed up to the speed of light time is relative it it just just stops so even in God's Universe there's a way there's a way for the finite to become infinite and the way to get there is to walk the way John came to prepare the way of the Lord what was he doing he was getting a people ready he was giving a message out saying sometime along the way you're going to along the highway you're going to see something that's going to feel impossible but it's the way it is the narrow way and and even even even even those around you the church might not might not might resist that might resist that but there's a way and it is the way of the pure and the holy the unclean shall not pass there through you see that scripture in Isaiah I just love that because to me that's my life when Christ came inside the Wilderness and the solitary Place shall be glad the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as a rose see what what is it that manifests the word inside of you is when you come up and you line up in the way and and that transition to the way that transition is God calling you calling you from the world then calling you even higher I I tried to find it but I couldn't remember how many of you have read the higher calling that's right he's in there I can't remember the missionary that wrote that I I kept thinking William Tindell but it's not him it's it's somebody else and he says you will try to make a success but God won't let you that's right so you see you see you have something inside of you you have something inside of you you you you you you have this desire for the word this desire for Christ to manifest himself in you to to to fully Express himself through you and and and sometimes we're afraid to make a step in a direction sometimes we're afraid to make a choice but I say this are you not a son of God is God not true is his word not true you step and it's wrong he'll turn your foot you see we must walk with humble confidence he say how do you do that how do you not walk arrogant you see what is arrogance it's the devil's perversion of what God's called his people to right God wants you to walk and saying I'm a son of God God's word is true all right here I go yeah now what are you doing as you walk can I walk down the steps as you walk down and you step and and the Way's over there and you're walking along and you think serpent seed wow right the ways right there and you think man Christ God the godhead now you step a little bit closer in the whole time Gods corre you ever had drive a car with lane lane assist God's saying hey you're going one lay or the other beep beep beep beep hand on the steering wheel put your hand on the steering wheel he says oh God's in control brother put your hand on the steering wheel God wants you to he says he says those that hear my word and do them yes we have been given a power in the word of God to do them and we say power and we can we can think of of of crazy mystical things but you know what the power is to overcome the flesh that is your goal and you need the flesh you couldn't be perfected without it you see we always say oh I can't wait to lay this flesh down and and get rid of this robe of Flesh why don't you just get into subjection get the flesh into subjection and watch what happens in your life the Perfection of that the Perfection of the finite subjected to the word of God is an eternal transition when you catch the power of the word of God and how Eternal it the Eternal quality that it holds you'll never put the book down what do you what do we need we we're hungry where we want to be fed we got to eat and eat and eat and eat and and and and the word of God is so pure you you never get stuffed you never get sick you just get stronger and stronger in God's word and and you get humbler he says in the evidence of the Resurrection little did I know as the angel spoke down here at the river before you all and said as John was sent as a forerunner of the first coming you'll send a message around the world it's happened every nation even up into Russia yes sir everywhere healing Services going on would have died down now there's something greater moving I'm waiting to hear the sound of the rushing of the mberry leaves I'm going on pray for me 1958 so the Disciples of John are there and now here is the way manifested in flesh before them and they had heard the highway John the Baptist preaching of that to come and and they're still following John so they're still on the road but there's a way he came to prepare the way you know the pavers they go out there they pave the road they're not responsible for where you drive on that road but they pave the way they PVE the road but there's a way there's the center line in that road so they come to Jesus and John's John's questioning his position you know do we seek for another but there was and not to make that to go on that point but there there was this this is evidence that there were these people people they were back there with John but then there was a transition and then those they heard the message of John and and and Paul comes to them and says have you been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they says we know not of any baptism because we were baptized in unto John un repentance I can't remember exactly how the scripture goes and Paul came to show them you're on the highway but there's a way you see there's always a higher plane there's always another level on the Statue of a perfect man there's always a deeper part of God we must attain to we must move to and so he says he says in leaty and church age so we can well see from these scriptures that the prophet in Malachi 3 who was John was not the prophet of Malachi 4 though indeed both John and this last day Prophet have upon them the same Spirit which is upon Elijah and I understand you are all aware of this stuff let me make a point now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so in our day in their day the way was Christ resurrected the day of Pentecost walking in the word and they were the original there was a transition period and that was that was their calling but then those Divine truths became a mystery amen and so now today we we have we have the word of God and we and we have it open but do you know God came and he opened it brother man's Ministry paved the way but have you found the way the road is there the highway is there and you're you're walking on it but have you found the way have you reached that position in Christ because God has a goal that is to pull a bride from a church he's not calling for status quo that's he's calling for a surrender you see everything a lot of times we we will hear it and we'll even lie lie to ourselves and say well I just can't see it that way really what it is is you just won't surrender that way many times you situations in our lives we know the word we just don't want to surrender to it but you see we're not called to walk the highway nobody's going to forget this line we're called to walk the way so in other words there is perfection within the word more than just the word a deeper part of God that he wants us to see because everybody not me more than the word but more than just the Bible the whole world has the Bible and they're more heathenistic than they were before and they're reading from the Bible because there's a way in the highway there's a way there that God wants you to see but the only way to reach that is is not to have a a mental you know like like understand the doctrine by knowledge but is for the doctrine for the truth of the word to go down into your heart you see you're sitting here and your brain is hearing a voice spoken and it's transmitting that to your brain and your brain is formulating thoughts and then God gets a hold of those thoughts and now it goes into your heart and it begins to change you yes sir what is happening eternity is growing inside of you God is manifesting inside of you and you look back and you say I used to do that and I don't anymore what happened sister when did you get the Holy Ghost but I'm acting like it when day which day I don't know but I'm not who I was the things that I found too hard to do I do the things I found too challenging I I just accept them that's right but God always has more God always has more for you to come to because there is a way and but the M says it is a Razor's Edge can anybody hear walk on the edge of a razor I can't neither can us we neither can we walk on water unless God calls us from the boat yes sir Peter called out says God I desire you he says come to me you called out how did you call out because you already recognized Peter already recognized Jesus for who he was so he called out to him go God Gave You revelation of who he was before the foundation of the world and when you saw him on the water you said called out to him and said God I want to come to you and he said come and now you walked in the impossible that's right walking according to the word of this hour is impossible but not with God you will the most miserable place a Christian can be is trying to serve God outside of Christ that's right trying to line up to a church order a church doctrine a church system outside of Christ it's a miserable existence but you get Christ you find yourself walking in the way of the divinely revealed mystery truths they're not mystery is anymore they're attributes of Christ and they're manifesting themselves in you you see it's not just it's not just a dress and it's not just a uh the Bible not just listening to tapes it's Perfection I I've only heard P bits and pieces I haven't seen Wednesday nights yet but 3% ain't good enough it's Perfection you say I want to I I want my life to to to resonate Christ Perfection says well it's impossible to be perfect no it's not it's impossible with with man it's impossible with the flesh but with Christ himself you see we we we there's a higher calling and and it's and and it starts to get you know you get down to to building a statue and never done it but I've heard you take big chunks off first yeah big pieces off of this big block of marble but then then you're you're with a small chisel putting the eyes in little pieces maybe just even dust as you as you grind you know nowadays we have Sanders and stuff like that and as you're sanding this out just dust is coming off not even chunks dust but unless that's sanded it doesn't look right that's right you get down you know i' I've seen it where you do like a statue of a bear saying it's epoxy and wood mixed epoxy has to be sanded down to like 600 grit or further than that and it takes hours upon hours to get the shine to come in and then a a final coat has to be wiped over it an oil has to be wiped over it you see God is down I believe with all my heart God is down to the place with the bride he's sanding and we're all in different places in our life but we we we can't settle for the highway we've got to attain to the way the the Perfection of God the the the the higher calling what in your life can you lay aside what what in your life and I'm talking down to the little things that's right yes Pride whether Ben seil here no I don't know I watch that sermon and God bless you for preaching that brother amen but it's that kind of stuff it's not brother Ben it's the word of God saying look you got to stop worrying about oh well I don't do the big stuff get down to the nitty-gritty get down to the way because the way is a Razor's Edge so what do you have to do somebody come to me the other day says brother I thought I had dealt with the bitterness of this with this person but something will come up a reminder of something will happen and I'll feel that bitterness raise back up and uh brother Chad well knows sometimes you don't have any words you go to God and the Lord began to speak and and just in my own in my own heart I was thinking man this is wow Lord this I never saw it in your word this way but I I I said don't try to attack bitterness don't don't try to go after bitterness and and remove bitterness said bitterness is is really just iniquity you know you shouldn't be bitter but you are and I said all you need is more word I said because the more word you pour into your vessel the more the iniquity flows out and I said and how you know because I know this is this is a hard part sometimes especially with young people how do you know that you've been delivered how do you know that that that God has given you power over the flesh it's when that thing Rises up and you're tempted but the Holy Spirit comes right behind and grabs a hold of that and puts it back into subjection the Temptation is not the desire it's God it's the devil tempting you and the Temptation doesn't mean your heart hasn't changed you just say God I need you and God comes with the Holy Spirit comes and takes a hold of that because you've given it to him already you've given it into his hands so the more that we take the word the less of us there is the less bitterness there is the less Pride there is the less reasoning there is and the more surrender we have to God the more these divinely revealed mystery truths become you and flesh Christ is a mystery of God revealed then come back in the last days and picked up all these Mysteries and clearly explain it reveal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed do you get it if you fail come back to this tape again don't know how much longer I'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus sayith the lord it's the truth it's the scripture like the seven Mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals has done been broken every age had come down and there they left a lot of scattering and God not willing that it should be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines they started and brought it on out and revealed the whole thing same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of Christ how he was God's three-fold purpose for the church now all that to get down to this letting letting them out revealing so the breaking of the bread again we walked on the road we walked on the road but then there came time for communion with Christ came time to communion with Christ and when were our eyes when were our eyes open when he broke the bread and then our hearts went back to what we had heard along the way says didn't our hearts burn within us didn't we know this was the truth but then God opened her eyes and how do we always say it it became a brand new book When God reveals something to you I I look at it this way at least for me personally God reveals something to me it's like I have a nude Looking Glass and I go back and I look through every scripture again because you see it different than you did before because you understand more of who Christ is so this this this this this communion this breaking of the bread that is the sign of the way the two on the road to emus what was the sign that they were on the way with Christ he broke the bread communion with Christ the breaking a revealing of Christ and it's necessary it's necessary for the bride to make that transition for us to make the transition in our personal lives we must come to that communion with Christ but you see we have to have the backstory we have to have the ministry along the way you're Faithfully taught here you take it home with you meditate on it until it becomes a broken bread to you the word is not it is not just your responsibility to sit here and hear the word preached there is more to it God wants you to go home and say what was it that I heard today God break the bread to me help me to have communion with you because oh brother and sister as you well know when you have communion with Christ you are never the same and sometimes you and and and anytime God has more of himself to impart to you you need that closeness with him again amen and I feel like every day there's more and more and more where you just want to slip away and talk to him and spend time with him cuz you say God I am a man I am dumb I don't know anything I can't speak when I say dumb Ian can't speak I I don't have I I have nothing of myself I have nothing of myself to give but God I know if I can get you you make all the difference in the world you will make the difference in this situation and he'll and and and God's in the business of revealing Mysteries amen say what's the mystery of this situation Lord I don't understand it and God will reveal it directly to you that's right Lord what's a what's a mystery I see this in your word and brother Chad has been preaching it and and the brothers have been ministering on it and I've heard it over and over again my whole life and I I hear Brother brandom talking about it but I'm missing something God reveal this this to me open it up to me and once he does guess what you will never be able to not see that and then he says wait there's more wait there's more so this way calls You Higher One Last One Last Point here as we close go tell my my disciples if there ever was a time and this brings us right back down to our point about the separation if there ever was a time that the Church of Christ needs its eyes opened it's today some more breaking bread their eyes were open and they recognized that it was him oh friend has he ever opened your eyes that way has he ever blessed you in such a way has he ever broke you apart from the things of the world because we are to be a type of Christ so we must be broken we must be broken go go back and listen to Masterpiece he has ever broke you apart from the things of the world separated you a breaking and an opening time that's what the church needs today is a breaking and an opening time you see it was twofold the breaking of the bread and and the opening of their eyes if you go back and you and you listen to brother Bram the angel begins to tell him before The Reeling of the seals you need to be more sincere you see the seals and the opening of the word and those final years of his ministry that was the transition that was the word for the transition to move the bride from the church that's right that's why it had to be recorded because we needed it this day that that transition in order to reach that he's the wave sheath right he's the one there first if you will so he what is whatever he needed to do be more sincere than you must as well God is calling us to be more sincere to let go of the apathy of the age that we live in I mean everywhere you look it's laziness just just laziness unconcerned brother preach that message unconcerned you must be convinced and then concerned because something inside of you says this is really really really really important right I I this is very important the angel tell tells him you've got to be more sincere you're talking about the prophet amen what a position we have to attain to and I don't say that to discourage you I say that to encourage you to inspire you if you will just be more sincere that thing in your life that you want to take care of that that even your church friends say what's the big deal with that but God's calling you to let it go he's calling you higher because there's a highway and there's a way there's a way and that way leadth unto somebody say it unto life there is a way and that way leadth unto life he is the way the truth and the life and the truth shall set you free amen that is our desire this morning let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord I in My Heart Lord Jesus father just one thing and one thing only Lord is is your word father if anything was said that was of my opinion may you may you cast that aside father as your children would take home what what you had to say say today may they meditate and father as we as we face this this higher calling that you've put in our lives Lord Jesus that that's where the battle really comes down that's where we really must stand with the belt of Truth The Shield of Faith the sword of the word of God we must stand to fight and when the Devil comes with different tactics and says well they don't find it concerning over there so why are you worrying about it you're you're becoming too legalistic you're becoming too concerned than that father in those moments we can discern that that's the enemy speaking we can discern that that's the discouragement speaking but Lord we ask that you'd walk with us along the way Lord that you would open yourself up to us Lord Jesus in these moments father where we begin to see a higher calling in your word and we desire to attain to that Lord help us father to reach for that to not be dis pers uh dissuaded on either side Lord to not be distracted Lord Jesus but to with vengeance with with passion with inspiration with with with with just a with just so much concern and sincerity reach for that and say God if this really is you and more of you help me to get to this place father that's our desire this morning I pray you just come Lord and and now with your presence you would just come over us Lord we would find a place in our hearts Lord we would find a place maybe at home to slip away more say God open yourself to me I've heard the word Lord the word has been spoken father it's here and maybe perhaps it's it's in my mind and I want it in My Heart Lord father so I lay myself again at your feet I open myself again at your feet Lord I Surrender again to you that you would take more of me out and put more of yourself inside of me Lord that's my desire this morning Lord thank thank you father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen musicians you can come amen Saints just it always comes back to this one thing more of God more of his word that's why that's that's the thing the devil fights the most is our time but there's this promise in the scripture that we can redeem the time amen because we have an eternal quality nobody else can redeem time but the elect of God cuz she holds her Eternal quality amen can we sing that shut in with God man praise the Lord sh with God in a [Applause] secet there in the seet [Music] beholding his gaining new power to run in the how I long to be sh just sing it again sh shut in with God in a secet place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in the race how I long to be shut in with amen bless you thank you so much real privilege to be here and Minister minister to you I I can tell there's a there's a hunger there's a desire just like mine for the word of God and is so precious to to us Amen brother Chad brother Blake shut in with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face I'm gaining new power to run in the race how I [Music] to amen let's all stand together man I was encouraged was also challenged yes and I'm leaving edified I believe and I believe you are too it's so encouraging to know know that we didn't get on this way by ourselves but God placed something in us that would draw us amen that he could draw amen because he can draw he can pull but if there's nothing there to respond to the pull we'll never get on the way but God had something he placed with inside of us that he could draw by his word to pull us on the way so thankful for that and now that I know God's brought me he's he's brought me to the way I want to head down that way and make some ground amen not to be distracted by by by what the brother was saying everything to the right or to the left and bouncing back and forth but oh God help me to stay focused you brought me here for a reason you want to bring me there's a destination friends and we know according to the word we have destination in Millennium we have a destination amen uh in new heavens and new earth but I believe in this manifestation we have a destination and the destination is to reflect his very image on Earth I believe it's his goal for the end time bride that we're here to be him on this Earth amen and he's brought us on the way to move us down to hit that destination I've been encouraged to be more focused to be more sincere to ask God to to Center my focus and stay focused on him and head down this way it's a narrow way we would have missed if we weren't predestinated to get on it it's a hard way we would have quit if he hadn't predestinate we'd have never found it we' never got on it we would have we would have been on the highway thinking we were on the way but God brought us from the highway to the way that's his grace in our lives I just want to stay focused I'm encouraged that there's a purpose in it all and we know the purpose but oh there's a million distractions but I don't want to be distracted by distractions these breaking the bread and opening more of himself to me I want to feed on it to have strength to move down this way what a good lesson amen amen let's just bow our heads and thank him for the word de Heavenly Father we thank you God for the word that you brought to us God how you've encouraged us Lord and in many ways you've corrected us Lord to get our attention back on you once again God we realize the world is riddled with all kinds of distractions and flashy things confusing things God your children have suffered with it Lord for thousands of years but God you have brought us by your own Grace to this Narrow Path and God you've given us a word like has never touched this Earth before God you've also used that word to place in this generation an isav Lord I pray that we would receive the isav and you'd give us Clear Vision by this end time message and God that we can walk down this way that we can move Lord down the road you have for us this specific way this Narrow Path this harder way Lord that we can yield and surrender to that that we can do it of our own choosing Lord that we can move Lord and make progress Lord in what you're calling us to to which our brother Lord is so so clearly spelled out you're calling us into Perfection not an impossibility Lord in you an impossibility in US yes but not an impossibility in you you sent a word to bring us to full maturity and we believe that that word will accomplish what you sent it for it will not return into your Void but it will fulfill in this day your desire to have a people in your very own image your body that's United with your head that is surrendered to you Lord and to you only God that's our desire help us God help us to to drop those things we've been carrying too long help us Lord to turn away from the distractions that are catching our attention and and bothering us Lord and keeping us distracted help us to turn away from that now give us the strength Lord to stay focused to stay sincere to stay more consecrated and to move forward into Perfection with faith that we will get there by your grace and that this word will bring us to this destination we love you father give us the courage to keep stepping forward trusting Lord that your word will keep us that your spirit would lead us and that if we ever go wrong you'll correct us God we pray a special blessing over our brother Chris Lord may you pour back into him all that he's poured out we thank you God for his Consecration and his sacrifice may you re reward him and bless him and his wife and their children God may he go
