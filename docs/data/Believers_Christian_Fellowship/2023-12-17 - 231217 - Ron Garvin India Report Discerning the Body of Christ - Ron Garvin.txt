into Lia and um I slept good and I don't know about brother Ron I think he was up and down a little bit but I slept good and feel good and I appreciate all your prayers I just say it is absolutely wonderful to be home uh it's it's good to go and see the brothers but it is really good to come home we had to pass by the church cuz I was going to drop brother Ron off at um Brother Sam and sister Jan's place and as I P pass the church I couldn't wait to get here and see everybody's faces today so praise the Lord amen I just had a a few things I wanted to share with you and um and then go into the prayer request I bring greetings from a whole host of people so there was a lot of people who wanted to make sure brother Chad would you please greet the church brother Roshan MSI and his family they wanted me to say a special hello to all of you ALS Al brother marapi and his family they wanted to say hello to all of you and then there was a a new brother that I had met last time I was there there's two different Brothers uh last time I was there brother Ran's I met a brother Samuel bumbaca and we went to his place and he sent greetings and then when I was in um Canada in October uh brother Chris marit's Church I met a brother Samuel Kota he was there visiting his son he lives in uh India as well was the first time we had met and we actually work worked it out to where we could go to his church and have fellowship with him this trip so he sends greetings as well then a whole host of others I mean there was numerous people would come and say please greet the church for us they feel like they know you they've streamed into services from time to time and and they just want to send a hearty welcome so God bless you all I took your greetings to them they send them back and it was wonderful so I want to make sure that we do that also I want to say thank you guys for praying it was a busy busy trip and there was several spaces in there and I'll share maybe some of that later several spaces in the trip where I absolutely knew somebody was praying and I and I needed it and so I appreciate it it was wonderful we had a good time we thank God for that man I also wanted to uh thank the ministering Brothers for ministering while I was away I I always try to catch up on the way home I want to hear what everybody heard before I come to church and by the grace of God I had long flights and I downloaded the sermons and I listened to all three and I was blessed cuz I went boom boom boom all three of them in a row so I think I had like six hours of no yeah 6 hours plus of the word that's a good way to fly home amen want say God bless you brother Gabe thank you so much and I enjoyed his service so much I enjoyed how he was open and honest and gave us an opportunity to to make a move and and I I appreciate how he handled a very difficult subject with tact and skill it was good God bless you brother thank you for that and then brother Emanuel God bless you brother Emanuel it was wonderful I enjoyed the service and I was getting excited about you we we have the identification but we have to be positioned I was like praise God that's right that's true and I enjoy brother Kyle's service of the witnesses of adoption I don't see Brother Kyle is he here it must not be feeling well but I that was the last one I watched and I I was in my seat cuz it's funny cuz I've got headphones on I'm sitting there they're next to this guy next to me and every once in a while he amen oh and I'm poting I'm pointing at my phone so I don't know what he thought but I was I was having a a good time so I just love those three Witnesses faith hope and charity amen that that was such a good thought and I enjoyed it so much and I just as I sat there and I watched three services in a row I said I thank God for faithful brothers who can carry the word and feed the sheep and I thank God that everybody can be themselves they can be what God made them to be and nobody's copying one another everybody can be free to be who they are the way they are and I just thank God for that that was wonderful so the Lord's certainly been good to us when it comes to the brothers who are faithful and can carry the word God has been good to us I want to give a very special thanks to brother Ron Garvin amen he was a good friend to have Along on this trip and he was a good traveling companion and we had a great time together and uh I really want to thank sister Becky and the kids for sparing him for a while I know it wasn't easy for them but I thank God that he was able to go and it really it was a great opportunity cuz um I knew brother Ron has a real heart for Missions I know he loves meeting the Brethren he has a heart for the overseas Brethren but to see it in action was really a blessing I saw a brother who really loves to meet brothers and sisters loves to meet them loves to know about them hear their stories their testimonies how they get called to the ministry and as I watched him I really found that brother Ron has a passion and a love for Missions work and it did my heart good to have him there with me and he was really good at carrying on conversations with the brothers getting information background stories and it just it helped me quite a bit and so he's an experienced traveler he did a great job traveling and he did good with the brothers and also he has a gift of exhortation he's really good if somebody ask him to get up and just share a thought the brother can take something in five minutes or 15 minutes and just drop a thought and it makes you think for months and months and months and so he did that a couple of times there they would ask him to get up and greet the people and he would take maybe 10 minutes or 15 minutes and share some inspiration from the Lord and and I saw that gift of exhortation really work and really helped me and it was a blessing to the people and then I had him pinch it for me one time because when it come to the Sunday service at brother Ran's I was just wiped out I need a little bit of a break because we were getting into uh a stream of services and he took that Sunday morning service at brother Ran's and it was good I enjoyed it and later brother ran gave him a testimony and told him how perfect it was and how it met a need in their assembly and that that was I know it was a blessing for brother R it blessed me but I know it blessed brother Ron just to know that God can take you and drop you in somewhere and use you and it and it helps you know so he was a great traveling companion and I appreciated having him along and it was good to see him in the missions field that desire and love that he has to see it in action I could really see that God's giv him a burden and a desire and he's specially equipped for that so I I really enjoyed that as well then one last thank you that I really want to thank my family they're very supportive and they they stick it out you know I travel a lot I'm busy and do a lot of things but they're really supportive and really good and I really want to S My Three Sons because while I was gone they U they built a back deck for me you know and um it was a huge blessing for me amen amen sometimes I fail in my duties at home and I can't get to the things I need to get to and that's Project's been left undone for quite some time and it needed to be done and I delayed it and I tried and I got to do it before winter and I finally bought all the material and and they just did it for me and I say thank you I appreciate that amen there's no way that we could do the things God calls us to do without a church family like this there's just no there's no way possible it takes a lot of support people see Ministry and they see travel and they see services and special meetings and Sunday and Wednesday but they don't realize the support that goes into a Ministry the support that goes into missions the support that goes into anything and I thank God for all of you it's not possible without people praying people holding the fort down making things happen and it's impossible without a family who's part of the ministry and so I just say thank you to my family and may God bless them and God bless all of you amen praise God I've asked brother Ron if he would do the trip report this morning and um he's been a huge helper to me Tak pressure off and this is another another one of the pressures that he took off of me and so I went home and went to bed and slept great but the pressure was on him so he's got several pictures in a PowerPoint that brother Franco helped with and that's another thing brother Franco did such a fantastic job we would send the pictures over he assembled the PowerPoint put everything on it so all we had to do not we I say we Loosely brother Ron all that we had to do was rearrange the pictures and delete some and it it saved us hours and hours of time so God bless you brother Franco for that and then I've asked brother Ron if he would just take a take the rest of the time that he has and just share an inspiration share a thought that the Lord's laid on his heart and Minister the word so he's going to do that this morning after the meetings at brother Ran's we were driving up to Emar to catch a flight to go to other meetings in hbad and it's a two-hour drive and i' woke up that morning with some pain in my back just over my waistband on the left side I had some pain and I thought I must have slept in an odd way and and so I I I'm in pain and but I get in the car and we get driving and the further we drive the worse I hurt and the worse I hurt and the worse I hurt until it was it was getting unbearable I couldn't really handle the pain in my back and then my left leg was starting to go numb I was getting tingling sensation and numbness in my leg and and then the pain got so bad it caused the headache so I started getting a really bad headache and then that caused nauseum and I started getting really nauseated and I'm in the backseat of a car going to an airport to catch a flight and you're thinking car plane car meetings that's the way that was going to go and so it kept getting worse kept getting worse kept getting worse kept getting worse and uh I texted my wife and I asked her to pray I said I'm I'm not feeling well I need you to pray and I finally tapped brother was Sean on the shoulder I said brother Sean can we pull over I need to get out of the car for me and I'm not feeling well so he pulled over and I got up and I had a jacket I took it off I got to drink of water and I stood up and I just said God you know you got to help me I know brother Ron was in the seat praying for me I could feel it you know I know and brother Sean and them that they they were concerned and I just walked around for a minute I got back in the car lated some of the pain still had a really bad headache and still nauseous feeling and we went down we had another 30 minutes and we stopped and we got out and I got out and walked around and as I walked around it got better got better got better we had lunch and it went completely Away by the grace of God Amen I don't know what it was I can't I can't explain it but it was something amen and it was serious it was really starting to worry me and concern me and I was even having thoughts like this I am not going to the hospital in India you know it was one of those really painful difficult situations but I thank God in and it and it went away the back paints that were going away the nausea dissipated quickly the back pain went away I had a headache a dull headache for a few more hours but then that back pain tried to come back a couple more times we just kept resisting it and finally it's gone been gone and we've been absolutely fine so I know my wife was praying at that time I know she s the text back say she was praying I know brother Ron was praying I know they were in the car and I know the rest of you have been praying for the trip and God honored those prayers anden and he helped me a lot so I just want to give God glory and credit for all of that and thank all of [Music] you I've just come into a valley like I've

of the words or you don't know the music or the melody and then I lost my voice and I still can't sing so if I just kind of growl it out than uh just to say brother sounds like brother Gabe so so so praise the lord it's good to be home amen it's good to see your faces uh see some uh new faces God bless each one of you let's uh just bow our heads before we uh turn to the trip report Heavenly Father we we thank you Lord for this opportunity Lord what you've done what we've seen what we've experienced father we pray that you get all the glory from it and I pray it'll be a a blessing to the people Lord you know my heart that uh we want to uh speak something to be a blessing to him Lord not just a slideshow not just a travel documentary Lord not that at all Lord but uh may it be an encouragement to to see brothers and sisters Lord that uh serving you worshiping you growing in your grace Lord and um uh may it be a blessing to the people here we ask these things in Jesus name amen before we are seated brother Chad asked me to uh asked me to share a few thoughts and uh of course I think he intended that I share some pictures then share some thoughts but uh True To Nature we aren't following the rules we are going to share some thoughts as we go and we're just going to trust the Lord to lead as we go so let's read a a text as it were it's going to be hard to thank each one but thank each one of you for praying you know some of us I hate to start naming names and and saying thank you brother thank you sister but each one of you some of you sent texts and uh All of You Prayed I hope and um it's been a blessing and for the brothers overseas they'll be watching this and uh God bless you Brothers um we've said Thank you to your face uh I'll I'm going to try not to single people out but it's going to be hard to do uh because we got to talk about individual people and the work that's going on there and and I don't want to honor one above the other but uh just just uh give me a little Grace okay let's uh turn to 1 Corinthians chap 11 and uh if I'd put a title on this beside a trip report let's also call it Discerning the body of Christ wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread verse 27 ver Corinthians 11 and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and in Matthew 25:40 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you've done it unto the least to one of the least of these my brethren youve done it unto me God bless you you can be seated we want to discern the Lord's body today and share with you uh many personal stories could be told we could share funny stories story sad stories uh we could just bless you in the spirit and and just have a really enjoyable time your emotions be stirred but that's not kind of story I want to tell today tell I want to tell you a story that'll touch your heart touch your soul leave you with an eternal permanent uh change so that's that's my attempt I can't do that you know I can speak to your ears God's going to have to do it he's going to have to come on the scene he always does he's faithful So speaking about the India missions trip December 4th that was on a Monday to the 16th which was yesterday um brother Franco whoops I said there I went done mention the name happy birthday uh he put this together uh you know I can throw a picture up there it's laborious for me that just not my comfort zone but I sent him the pictures he put it together and then I just had to go weed through 242 slides and brother Chad said yeah 40 or 50 I've got 96 brother so but I was encouraged I was listen to brother gab's sermon this morning as I was getting breakfast and getting around and I listened to about half your service brother Gabe and and you said I got 96 slides and I think you got the three I'm not I got 96 we can do this but I think the people want to see more than three slides so I'm kind of stuck with this one brother Gabe but uh I was just amazed at uh what brother Gabe was trying to express in heart there in the portion that I heard and uh brother Emanuel I know you're the same way that uh trying to express what I'm trying to express here today uh so I just pray that you'll each one be blessed by this India and I didn't know this brother frankco put this together that must be their slogan truth alone triumphs I don't find much truth over there except in the Believers uh but it will Triumph so that's for sure capitals New Delhi that's where we flew into population one 1.4 billion people uh second most populated country in the world 80% Hindus 14% Islam 2% Christianity 2% siks uh the USA is three times larger than India in land area land mass but India has more than four times the amount of people and if I've done my math correctly the density uh how's I got this here us didn't uh population density is 93 people per square mile and India is 1,67 per square mile so you know that's just like a little country town from coast to coast can you imagine that now go with us you'll imagine it so our first we flew into to New Delhi and uh then we flew onto uh brother Ran's uh Village and I can't pronounce these names any better than you so we're just just going to say brother Ran's Village and I think it was an hour flight there with layovers and everything it was 36 hours time we left Lima by the time we arrived brother Ran's so uh quite the travel we get to his home got a wonderful house this is the second story um and uh you can see that door there there's two two doors right there brother Chad had one room there there was two or three rooms behind me I had one of those rooms set up real nice for Minister got their home private bathroom and everything and is wonderful this is the original Church brother ran worked out of uh being a poor guesstimate of U crowds and such I would say there was probably you could fit 75 Americans in there maybe I think they were worshiping there with 150 but it was they couldn't squeeze them all in there they was spilled out in the courtyards and all through his house so they needed to do something and I think this was the main purpose we went over there uh was to uh dedication of the of the church brother uh Joe and brother uh Chad went over last October for the groundbreaking U portion or the early construction phase we went over there for the dedication of the church this sign is on it's on the main road going into the town where brother ran lives this sign is right outside their the gate welcomes you the municipal Council of Shem chusai or whatever welcomes you to the land of saints thought that's wonderful praise the Lord this is a computerized rendering of uh of the final product what they want it to look like it's two stories uh and so it's got the pavers uh paver bricks in the courtyard there in the front so that's that's the vision they've got this is what they've got so far they've got the first story up uh they don't have the papers down uh they've still got to put the paint on the inside they've got to put the electric on the inside uh but they're they're worshiping in there and they're um really coming along it's really looking nice now you can see this structure uh those poles and that that platform that was part of the the the PO supported a big tent now this this area in front of the building I'm guessing could probably Park a dozen city buses in there and even right these poles are high enough they probably could pull right underneath of it so it's a it's a rather large area well they put all these poles up and they put a big tent across it and then they put like an AstroTurf down on the ground and then everybody just sits on the ground and then they had the platform there for the for the minister so that's the way they do it over there he's got enough land that he can have big meetings this is the back of the church and the same way in the back all this space you could probably put I don't know maybe a dozen city buses in there as well and uh this is the they had that was all covered with a tent and that's where they fed the people and so their their vision is to have a special meetings have youth meetings and it'll be a hub for India that people can can gather there it's you know not everybody has got the facilities like this it's out in the country uh a far enough away that they can they've got this kind of a land so um so it's really a a great thing and I'm glad that we've been able to be a part of it we this is not our church we've not sponsored all this we've been a part of it so other churches involved as well and uh the brothers and sisters the church over there the local church just um makes me tired thinking of all the work they're doing now I'm standing on these pavers right here looking at the back of the church then I turn around and take a picture that same area they've got uh restrooms they've got office they've got a kitchen on the far right is a uh roof over an eating area and this is where they've been having church until they got the main building done uh the brothers took advantage of that during the during the daytime and sat out there and fellowship uh just a really relaxing atmosphere away from the hubhub of the city and off to the left of that um area that building there they realize if we're going to have uh big meetings and conventions and stuff the two bathrooms we've got which are multi-use you know multiple people can use it at the same time but it's not going to be a sufficient when you've got hundreds of people there so they built over to the uh to the left of that building they've got uh restrooms plus I think they've got a couple shower stalls in there so so they're set up to be able to uh to handle the uh the crowds there's a kitchen in there this this is the local churches sisters are in there cooking this was for the Sunday Meal which the dedication was on a Thursday and so uh we'll get some pictures of that later but on the Sunday there was a small crowd so the sisters are in there cooking um and well all of them kids and brothers are all pitching in there helping out and uh and working that sister in the front there in the Middle with the purple shawl on that's brother Ran's mother I believe so um Point her out so just you know how it is a lot of you been involved with the family camp in the past and different special meetings you know how much work it can be they've got a bit baptismal there uh that's is this is the baptismal area um off to the back right corner of course it's cluttered with everything because of the meetings that they had so it was just a very very busy time and they was just constantly working it was a just real blessing to see them all pitching in and doing together it was a real real blessing this is standing out on the road uh which is a dangerous place to stand in India so maybe I surely was standing off the road but they honk before they hit you so you don't have to worry about it but they've got a wall there and you can see the church behind there but they've got this wall because the cattle just roam freely and U you just can't have cattle all up on your front doors of your church so they've got that this little building to the left is kind of a Outreach office and they're planning to have somebody they stay there all the time to offer free literature I don't know they probably offer coffee or whatever they can for travelers going by counseling prayer whatever just um the just Outreach minded and so that's their uh vision for for that little building and beside that building is a gate they'll get a a proper gate installed at some point that's more of the work still going on um on the opposite end of that wall is another entrance and then that wall there with a uh cutout of the Cross and it's got an inlay of LED lights so that lights up at night time it's just uh just a beautiful work they've got going on there now behind the wall on this one one we're still at the same vantage point but it was a this was on Thursday I think when the big meetings were going on you can see the orange and the white banners behind that that is the tent my voice is still rough so forgive me if I have to cough and be a problem be thankful you weren't one of the guys sitting beside me on the plane they were a little a scans but there was nowhere for him to go so I prayed for him so but uh they had two the portable generators to to run all the equipment there at the church but I wanted to show you that and then also they've got some flowers and and Landscaping there that they're doing uh they brother ran I well brother AIT as well another brother there they just got a real love for gardening and and doing all this and so it's going to be beautiful when it's all done so if the Lord carries so there's little lights you can see those flowers sitting in the wall there's little lights shine down in those at night time it's it's just uh well thought out well planned uh project um I kind of like woodworking so I threw a few of these in here and I don't know other Woodworkers we've got these are te Teakwood Doors Big Brass handles heavy doors they got five hinges on those they're not finished yet you can see the size of them I suppose they're about 8ot tall this is Brother AET here just to kind of give you a size comparison the brass hardware the details of the wood and I liked it so I threw it in there I guess I could have cut those out brother Chad I'm sorry about that they'll be fired so interior they they do have like a chandelier up uh of course they'll the balloons probably won't be there for every service this is just a special occasion but I wanted to try to capture the ceiling how they've got I think they call Tray ceilings that's recessed up in there and just uh it's just well thought out they don't have the paint in here yet so um but it's a work in progress and and they're doing a good job I think that door on the left is the cry room the one in the far back by the window is the uh Sunday school if I'm not mistaken in the Sunday School room they've got you know this fancy U ceiling they've got you can see the wires hanging down there in the Middle where there'll be a light they've got you know collared tiles on the floor and they've got paint in that room so they're starting on the work and uh it's it's kept them busy and we're looking forward to them getting this project done because one of the brothers that is just one of the main driving forces is also an evangelist that we want to support to go he's just got in his heart to go and I'd rather have him go spread the gospel then build a church but yet we need a church too so we're just caught here I think this was Wednesday night when we came up uh we stopped there we we arrived Wednesday night and so it was late when we got the brother Ran's and we swung by the the church to see it it's all lit up with lights and and the brothers are working and it's late at night uh to me this is a trustees nightmare you know this is Wednesday special meetings are Thursday and they're leveling dirt in the front of the front door you can see a roll of AstroTurf there uh but they're doing it with a smile it was just it was just a real blessing to see him doing this this is the architect he is a converted Hindu I think they call him brother Jonathan and uh it was really interesting talking to him just seeing the vision that he had and how he's uh surrendered his life I don't all these brothers have a testimony and I'd love to hear each and every one of them he come from Hinduism and he left a job in the city moved out to this more rural City to focus on this project to build that's how grateful he is to see the light to come out of the Hinduism and God's blessed him so uh praise the Lord and he so he's one of them that's just laboring on this uh but uh God bless him and he has already and I know he will continue to do that I did not put any video in here I've got video but I didn't get that part put in but you can see the front doors of the church building you can see the ribbon there and the brothers gathered there to go up brother Chad went up cut the ribbon and then all the brothers entered in uh probably all the visiting ministers entered in and they said a few words from the pulpit had some prayer and uh and then they went back outside under the tent and had the service out there for the dedication Service uh their theme for the service was the sound of rejoicing so they were rejoicing it was a very special time you can see the big screens on on the left side and on the right brother Chad and brother ran you can see them in there they're down on waiting to be invited up after the singing so they've got a drone flying videoing this plus they got video cameras set up and this is on YouTube you should be able to to catch it I don't know where you'd go but Frank was probably got the link for you but you know so they've got these two big screens there and uh there may have been screens around back in case there were people around behind the church as well but you can see the masses the sisters sit on the one side Brothers sit on the other and that's the culture the way they do it over there Sunday school came up sang a special I think they sang it in English uh so it was just a a special time you know we can stop and talk about every single one of these pictures for uh my brother Chad's going to Lim me about two seconds a piece so we can get out of here on time today but uh I got my glasses on brother Chad I can't quite see you out there these are reading glasses that that helps me this man in the red turban is a seek and the seeks are a branch off of the Hindus um we won't go into detail on their religion um but a devout seek one of the things he carries is a knife I forget what they call it in their he in their native tongue it's called the gentleman is uh what it is uh the translation of it is and if you talk bad about his religion he's obligated to kill you good people to be friends with so but they are they're A Min minority but yet they stick up for the minorities and they're predominant in the Punjab region and so the government doesn't mess with them and so the I my impression is the Christians have a little more freedom there um so brother rashan invited everybody had Billboards he had all kinds of advertisement everywhere his friends come and it uh and they sat right in the meetings and participated in the meetings so it was uh just a pleasure to see um we should have that kind of testimony you know I feel like what brother Emanuel has spoken in the past and brother Gabe was speaking about you know um that's the impression I get maybe that's not what you was speaking about but you know where's our heart are we Discerning the Lord's body that could be a member of the the body of Christ right there that's right we don't know we're going to throw him out with the dogs until he comes to the Lord uh so they they're making a testimony there so here again the the theme of the service there and brother ran up there translating from Brother Chad uh it was a real blessing uh the people were blessed it was just wonderful meetings we could go on and talk about it and well you just need to go hear it so afterwards they served all the people food they went behind the church that's also under a tent you can see them sitting on the AstroTurf uh type material and they just go down through there with a bucket and they just scoop it out and feed it right there another guy comes with a big Kettle probably a two gallon kettle of tea and he's just pouring tea as he goes along and and and feeding them and taking care of them and uh it was just quite an operation for the smaller meetings and stuff the the church always pitches in does their own cooking but since this was such a large uh meeting we asked brother ran you know how many people are you expecting he said well we're making preparations to feed 3,000 people I don't know if there were that many there but I think they hired these people to do the cooking just these huge kettles I don't know 50 gallons or something like that some of them over Woodfire some over LP tank burner cooking that Curry and and brother Chad loved it so so where's brother Joe brother Joe here he's in the back where you at brother J got take my you're supposed to be in the front brother you didn't want to get too close to me did you so yeah I uh I like riding my food so Chad kind of stayed the one you know he kind of stuck with the Indian Cuisine I I had fried potatoes bow potatoes mashed potatoes I had french fries I I tried it all so but I wish I had a a video of this for you but but I don't and we can't go too long but uh these ladies making chipot chapattis which is like a big tortilla and you see the size of that thing it's probably this biger round then they throw it on this big uh big disc over a wood fire and and cook it and they just that was just a production line for that many people that just kept on going are we Discerning the Lord's body I I love the little children love to get the pictures of them uh got a heart for them so got to throw a few pictures those in there this man I didn't get to meet him I'd love to hear his story we've all got a testimony he was a a seek and he's a he's a gospel Minister now he's a message Minister now his little boy there I don't know if he's converted so but he looks like he might still need some conversion there so uh on on this picture you see uh Jonathan the uh the architect on the left uh Brother P is the Evangelist he's he's a really a driving force on on the project and uh a good brother really really enjoyed the fellowship with him the work he's doing up in rajastan uh love to include that in this uh report but not today we won't have time for that so we'll catch it later um he reminds me so much of Brother Don Don in the Philippines that we know we're familiar with always got a smile on his face soft spoken and just driven to spread the gospel and uh I appreciate that about Brother P that's the kind of man I want to I don't want there to be any excuse for him to say well I couldn't go I just didn't I just couldn't I couldn't go I could didn't have the funds to go I didn't have the ability I didn't have let let let's send somebody that can go so I would love to go with him I probably would not survive so but uh so I'll I'll be appreciative of the pictures we get so that's brother ggen there beside him he's a song leader he's also an evangelist um I threw this picture picture in here I don't know this brother's name but I'm sure he's got a story he was a crippled brother the brothers carried him in set him in the chair and they were having fellowship and then I noticed is as the brothers begin to Fellowship they they got up and began to begin to wander around greeting each other there he was setting facing the way they' placed him looking at a blank wall everybody's fellowshipping behind him I want to include them you know I don't know what kind of troubles that brother's going through appreciate the uh special sister Priscilla I've sang that song too uh I think most of us if we're a singer could sing that song or at least humm it we've all been through some trials who what just want to enter into their suffering this is uh Titus on the left it's brother Ran's youngest son I think he's 18 years old and brother AIT they're a special team love to see them guys working together brother must be around 60 years old and he calls Titus his supervisor and they get the work done so and just it's hard not to include all these special people in there so there's more advertisement on the back of this little taxi cabin uh it's got the advertisement there a sound of rejoicing for the special meetings um that was all the the dedication service was on Thursday we arrived on Wednesday dedication was on Thursday noonish I guess and then Friday we had men's breakfast and just relaxed for the day and U and that was very nice on Saturday we went to this brother in the center that's brother Aaron George brother Joe and brother uh um Chad went there last year so we was able to go back again this year I shared a little bit of a short exhortation 10 minutes maybe something like that and then brother uh brother Chad preached nice nice Church nice congregation and the people people appreciating it responding to it uh I just got that that sister there with her hand up in the air she was just she was just right there with brother Chad the whole whole time just really really entering into as I snap the picture uh there's just no way you can share everything but I tried brother Chad now it reverse roles on Sunday brother Chad needed a break so he gave an exhortation or a greeting or something I was back studying preparing and then uh after he he gave a short introduction there I came to the pulpit and shared a thought with the brothers there it was just the local church um and so that was on Sunday on Monday we left brother rashan's up in the Punjab which is close to Pakistan and we traveled south to brother uh Samuel kotes in Hyderabad this is the brother that brother Chad met in Canada so we traveled down there on Wednesday uh I think I've got the details there we left brother Ran's at 5:30 in the morning got to our hotel at 6:00 p.m. so 12 and 1 half hours travel time got picked up at 7:00 to go to the service so just once we got to this point I kind of lost contact with the world also lost my voice so I'm kind of like a what they call it a one hit wonder you know preach one time lose my voice and leave the rest to brother brother Chad but uh hydrabad uh metropolitan area of 250 250 square miles Allen County Ohio is about 400 and some square miles 47 square miles uh so it's about you know a little over half the size of Allen County with 11 Ohio has a population of 11.78 million hydrabad half the size of Allen County has 10.58 million people so we're not in the rural areas anymore uh got a nice Church established would love to tell their testimony how their father labored in the in the word and established churches brother uh brother Samuel's father for years and and they started this uh built this big church and it was a I think it was a orphanage wasn't it brother Chad and so they were doing a work amongst the poor amongst the orphans and um and they've got an established work there so um it was a pleasure to fellowship with them I was losing my voice but I was able to uh stand up I couldn't sing so I just recited or just read the lyrics to a song it was a blessing to me kind of shared that as a testimony and then uh brother Chad preached there this is Brother Samuel on the left his brother Boaz who was also a pastor in another location um so um this is Brother Samuel's church not real large but a nice size there uh enjoyed I wish wish had the video of the translator he was just right there with brother Chad and it was just fun to watch this young man just right there entering in uh with the ministry of the word so just a view of the congregation after the service we had had our supper there in the in the church and then we got back to the hotel I probably after midnight that's just kind of the way things Ran So that was uh Wednesday yeah Thursday was dedication Friday was breakfast Saturday was but Aaron GES Sunday was the uh church service brother Ran's Monday was here Tuesday we went to this church brother uh Samuel bacas which brother Chad said he met last year as well this was Tuesday night so that's Pastor Samuel buaka he also did the Translating for brother Chad and uh another little least of my little ones there so the couple on on the right hand side visited us here in this church they've got a daughter over here somewhere so some of you may have met them they're from across the continent I didn't get things together forgive me for that I we got in late and I fell asleep on the floor and got up in the middle of the night worked on a little bit fell asleep again and got up again and so but I'd love to have a picture of uh India and shown you where everybody came from uh they traveled to special meetings with brother Marlo py and and these people people traveled a distance as well lots and lots of flowers everywhere we went lots and lots of flowers from Brother uh Samuels in Hyderabad we uh traveled to I can't pronounce the r the name they shortened the natives shorten it to weag uh so we'll call it weag because you don't know how to pronounce that either so brother Marlo PES we we flew an 1 hour flight and then he took us on a two and a half three hour drive to the location where the uh meetings were going to be it probably would have been a quicker drive but it's a four-lane highway divided by a concrete median and then they've got um big dirt burms so you can usually fit you like four lanes of traffic in that so uh well they decided to have a political rally and they closed down one side thank the Lord it was the other side but it just stopped everything I don't know if that guy really got a lot of votes or not I don't think I'd be voting for him cuz the side that was closed was the one that went towards the airport so I wonder how many people missed a missed a uh a uh plane ride on that day but so was some distance from Brother uh uh jber ratum marble putties and they rented a convention hall beautiful place one that they often use and uh here they've got the seats set up so because it's it's all set up for this and you can get an idea of the size of it just a really really nice place brother maruti's Sons that's uh Emerald Livingston Emerald Livingston and on the guitar there is uh Moses Livingston and then on the drums is uh David Livingston and then their cousin is on the other guitar he's got five Sons or middle names all of them is Livingston and uh wonderful brothers really a big help to uh brother Mar py really a pleasure to have them and I'd love for you to hear they're playing it wasn't the standard um music of uh India and it was just real worshipful and just really enjoyed it so hope I'm not running out of time here so brother Chad preaching brother Mara py was right into it he preached himself right out of his jacket and I he's always so prim and proper but he just took his jacket off threw it on the floor and kept on going so it was really uh really fun to to watch the people brother Mary and the people entering into the word after the service that was uh Wednesday night we just seen this is Thursday morning we had another service after the Thursday morning meeting they never called an alar call but the people just came forward and uh and the ministers were up there praying with them and uh the people were responding to the word and so we just uh rejoice in that we can't you know lift up and oh brother Chad preached A good sermon the people responded to the word and it was just uh very very special time and I like this picture here it looks like I'm a dynamic preacher so I'm going to save that one so on Thursday evening uh I gave a maybe 15minute exhortation and then brother Chad closed the service there and that was our last service that was on the Thursday night so on Wednesday night we got home we got back to the hotel at like 2:00 a.m. Thursday night we got back to the the hotel at 2: a.m. uh so it was a a a trying trying uh time there uh it was a comfortable in the building about 72 de with air conditioning and this man in the yell has got cotton gloves on a tobogan a sweater under that sweater and a scarf across his face and when I was shaking the brother's hands as they was leaving they were cold and you know I was sitting there I'm well I don't know if I had short short sleeve shirt on that day or not but I was enjoying it but but it was uh I felt sorry for these but God bless them you know they they were not in their comfort zone there a lot of the people toboggans on and scarfs on covered up all these brothers uh all but two of them I believe well brother ran myself brother Chad and two of the the natives brother maruy ordained every one of them in the message and I don't know how many churches he's established in that area uh you know when brother Marley py comes here you see a little simple unassuming brother but they've all got a story and I would love to sit and hear their story we will someday Lord willing so and every one of these ministers gave a little bouquet of of uh Thanksgiving to brother Chad so lots of flowers this is Brother maruti's family myself brother ran brother Enoch Livingston brother Mar's wife and then beside brother Chad is uh emerald and then David and then Moses I believe so wonderful he's got uh one more son that is uh is he in the UK he's just on taking schooling so he wasn't not there and he's got a daughter as well that we met later brother Mar py said we don't have time to shake everybody's hand just line up and wave so they did and we felt like celebrities as we left you know had to roll the window down say goodbye to everybody and they're about this far away so I just reached my hand out and we just kind of given a hand slap as we went by but by the time we got to the end it was a mad rush and had to get your hand back in and let them go so it was uh it's just so good to meet these Precious Precious people it does my heart good this was our last supper we got home from the meeting at 12:30 back to the hotel they had supper waiting on us and uh then we sat around and visit till 2: or 2:30 in the morning and then we had to head home at 10:00 the next day on Saturday morning uh or was it Friday it was Friday morning i' still got my days messed up forgive me so Friday morning 10:00 we left there drove back to wisag flew to Deli flew to Amsterdam flew back to Detroit drove home and I think it was 30 hours uh travel time to get home how much time I got brother Chad I got 15 minutes that's a joke between us so I got five minutes which means half hour I want to just ask the Lord to the share thought let's stand again give you just a little bit of a break read our opening scriptures again 1 Corinthians 11 just a portion of verse 29 not Discerning the Lord's body in Matthew 25 in as much as you've done un one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me brother Bram says in one of the I think I've got the quote coming up the greatest thrill I have is living for Brothers amen may God bless the thought this afternoon you can be seated just got some quotes that uh struck me and uh just wanted to share them with you and this is where I felt like it was just right in line with what brother emanuel's spoken many times and his heart and brother Gabe's heart so uh if I cover back I haven't heard your service brother a Gabe so if I cover some of these same thoughts that you were on and uh I put this together last night and I listen to your started listening to your sermon this morning brother Brad says in Revelations chapter 4 part three says if something operating has to be called out or said something about it called down or something on that order and the person that's got that gift rejects it just remember refuses it remember the gift wasn't right it wasn't God in the first place the spirit of God always is ready for correction sweet humble willing see if it if it stands up and says I'll do it anyhow you know how sometimes just remember arrogant Spirits are not of God and man when you go overseas can you ever tell when you're in the presence of an American all that travel and all that hustle and bustle and the honking of the horns and I didn't see anybody get upset but then on the ride back to America I sat between two Americans and you know they're offended for you to get up and use the restroom or if you cough and it's like the one guy said I hope I don't catch that said well I'll pray for you he said well it's not not not a bad thing to have the intervention of the almighty or something like that so well I guess we're back in America so told Brother Chad it' be good to get back into uh familiar chaos over in India it's chaos but it's unfamiliar chaos well we're back into it's just all chaos so I don't know whether it's a good thing or not but and arrogant Spirits are not of God and that's the American Spirit but we are not of this we are not the have that American Spirit so what a difference you see when you go overseas and when you just even here when you fellowship with the brothers and sisters uh arrogant Spirits are not a God if you've got an arrogant spirit it's not a God just put it plain and simple you know they've got the Amplified Bible I guess if I wrote One it' be the condensed Bible let's just get it out quick and be done with it so I take subst a substitute when everything the whole Earth is filled with the glory of God you see real power of God why will we take a substitute we're too late in the day now and I think most of these quotes continue on that same sermon says you have to have spiritual understanding remember God never did and never will on this Earth dwell in glamour he's against it he'll never the great messages will never be make great big so and so and so and so it don't do that way his servants don't work in that manner his Glamour and glory is above and uh it's uh you see a man trying to make something of himself uh that goes against the spirit that's in me um I don't want to get long-winded but uh but it's a burden on my heart elas are the model servant I don't and I I need to familiarize myself with the story there but I don't think it records what went on by the time he left with Rebecca and arrived to Isaac it doesn't record what happened there but something happened there Rebecca was in love with Isaac when she seen him can that be say said the same of you and I when we get to the end of our journey those people that we're witnessing to who are they in love with you or or their Isaac Jesus Christ um and I think it's a shame uh when the people are drawn to the servant as not a model servant but you have to have spiritual understanding remember God never did and never will on this Earth dwell in glamour this make some great big so and so God doesn't work in that humility we don't go around brag about those things you know there's there's a lot of wonderful things went on in the the services over there and uh you know we could lift up a man wow brother Chad did some wonderful preaching he did appreciate it uh are we trying to build up a man or we let's just give God the glory brother Chad can't preach nobody can preach and be of any effect on an eternal level unless it's God doing the work so you know there's men great preachers doing a great job um but drawing disciples after themselves so we don't go around brag about those things and we don't want to do that here you know post it up on the internet oh this all this happened this happened um it was a blessing to be there let's just put it at that so just don't let the right hand or the left hand know what the right hand's doing we talk about it among ourselves but we don't blast that out somewhere because that's self- Pride like like God could only do that for one person you know come back saying I prayed for so and so they were healed um why don't you just say it like it really is that person had enough Faith to touch God Amen you just hav to be standing there amen as if God could only do it for one person what what an arrogant attitude to think man I the people really blessed by my Ministry Lord help me Lord help me he'd do it for anybody that will believe him amen it's belief Faith whatever whatever you want to do whatever your thoughts are take it to God he provides everything isn't that right he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermon be lived it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it they say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living they if they never was a man of God if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get the people tangled up and you won't know well you'll you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here is voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God th thundering out in sweetness Holiness Purity undefiled lives you know we could we could cut that quote in half there and talk about the thunder of the god and and man we could get an evangelist up here and and really drive that home the Thunder of God thundering out against this sinful nation and let's not forget the rest of that thundering out how in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walk around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's that's Thunder against the enemy that's right the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil you want to shake the devil you want to Stomp The Devil you want to give him a black eye all right there you go do it sweetly do it humbly just like well you say if I could preach like Billy Graham or or Roberts or somebody a great intellectual speaker he' oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life look at those disciples down there that Maniac child that day with epilepsy saying come out of him devil come out of him devil come out of him devil the devil sitting there said now aren't you making a pretty shame of yourself now he said see what you're doing Jesus told you he commissioned you to go cast me out not one of you can do it didn't move that devil but brother when they seen him come one come walking quietly uhoh Oh my he didn't have to say nothing that devil was already scared right then he knowed he had to leave right cuz there come a life not only a sermon but a life said come out of him oh my that done it quietly he knowed what he was talking about he know what he was doing amen amen excuse me you know uh just like brother Gabe was saying you know I don't understand a lot of things I don't have deep Revelation I'm not even going to pretend to waste of my time waste of your time I'm not going to fool anybody I'll just be the fool but I won't fool anybody so this message in all of its Theology and Doctrine which is just good we need that I need that I need to be more dedicated to to understanding but if there's no life behind it you're wasting your time you ready to quit brother Chad that's the last quote I've got want you come on up I'll share just a little a little bit more experience with you my brother Chad standing up here suffering with me I let him down over there got a sore throat but God was good to us at that church dedication uh I was taking the pictures and uh as the brothers were going up to the to the front door to cut the ribbon you know I'm trying to get a picture with the camera and um I could have jumped to the front I could have pushed my way through the crowd and stood right up on top video camera would been on me the the Drone would have shown me and then I could started making myself known glad to have you all here and like to introduce you to the pastor here and just and take what a shame what a shame to think of somebody stepping out of their position like that and uh I just this was such a reverent moment between brother ran the congregation and this was a special moment they labored for and I just thought this is not my place it's not my position stand back get the pictures record it but don't get in the way you know if you ever been around a cing couple and maybe they step off into a room just to have a few private words and you step in there un knowing and all of a sudden you realize that I wasn't invited here and you just kind of quietly excuse yourself sorry just step out you know those are holy moments that uh that sometimes we experience and uh I kind of experienced that at that church dedication and then I kind of shared that as a little testimony with at brother Aaron George's on the uh Saturday night meeting and U and that's just the way I feel you know at that meeting I I said you know God wants to speak to you and uh I don't want to interrupt what God wants to speak to you just let me step aside let me do that daily God's God's got a relationship in mind he doesn't need me in the way um I was the best man at a at a good friend's wedding and uh so that's a place of honor stood in the front I could have stepped up and taken the microphone the the pastor introduce myself and begin to just it's out of place you're you're not called that it I was in place of honor it was uh as a really privilege to be there I was there to serve the the bride the bridegroom I knew him he was my good friend I didn't know his bride I'd never met her before and uh I can't serve the groom without serving the bride you know to say do you you know to the groom do you need something to drink you know would you like this like that you know what can I get for you and ignore the bride or if she said could I have a drink like you know you got your own attendance I'm here for the groom you know what an insult and but also at the reception dinner of course I get to sit in the front at the recept big table you know and but when when I see the bride or the groom uh run out of something you know their favorite little pastry or their drink or something I'd hop up and and get it to them because they were special to me if she's special enough for him to marry then she's special to me too but then I got to thinking about the the the guests they weren't the best man I was the best man they weren't the the bride but they were the guests and they were all invited so they were special to the bride and the groom so I felt like if they're special to them then they're special to me too and that's the way I want to approach uh things not to say that I always do but thinking of those siks and those Hindus over there uh the Sinners walking the street and on our own uh communities um they might be at that wedding supper maybe not as the bride but they might be there as a guest and how do we serve them if you've got an arrogant attitude that uh you know I had been the best man had the fancy suit on you know I could have an attit itude it's like look at me I got the suit you don't but if an arrogant attitude as we read at the beginning is not of God and I want to have a heart for the people because they're he died for them and uh yes it's his desire that they'd be there some of them will be according to how they treat the bride uh so I just put a challenge out there to you amen what kind of an attitude do we have how are we looking at people seen a little Hindu child I guess on one of the airplanes had a little dot center of his head it was I don't know um seven or eight months- old cutest little guy parent you know tossing it up in the air and it's giggling and laughing just that poor little child is going to be set on a path just like its parents were set on a path if it wasn't for God's grace brother Gabe we could be there amen right if we've got the love of God in our heart let's live like Christ how did he live amen God bless you it's good to be home good to see [Applause] you praise God Amen it was wonderful it was Wonder wonderful to be together it's wonderful to experience the things together that we experienced and uh I really like that thought and brother doesn't know it because we we already know he told us he didn't get the Kyle's message yet but he's right in line with what Kyle preached so right in the same vein of thought brother so that was really good the continuity was wonderful did you notice that everything just moves right in line amen I think God's speaking to us teaching us that the way we treat people matters our attitude our conduct and what we think amen matters because we don't know who's who but we know everybody's got the potential amen if God if God put their name in the Lamb's Book of Life they're going to be there as long as they don't do something to have their name removed they're going to be there amen praise God I just want to share just a couple more things with you and then we'll close but uh I just want to say we met some fantastic Brothers while we were there Brothers who've labored for years years pastored for a long time started multiple churches and we we've seen the sacrifices that they have made and I just want to just say it was a blessing for me just to sit down and talk to them veterans you know you always think when you get invited to go some place and they they invite you and they want you to come or maybe you travel from America and it's a misconception many times amongst individuals that somehow that they need you these are brothers who started 60 churches Church they don't need you they're just there CU they appreciate you you're a friend to them they may appreciate the ministry that God's put in you but they don't need you my goodness they started brother Mara py started over 50 churches he's ordained more than 50 ministers they they they didn't need us did they brother Ron but we sure enjoyed their Fellowship sure learned from them you know brother Samuel Kota and his dad brother peash and his brother Boaz they worked together and uh they started over 100 churches they together have built more than 100 churches amen they didn't need us but the fact is they wanted fellowship and they enjoy we enjoyed the fellowship with them we had a good time and so every time I travel anywhere where the bride of Christ is I learn something every time I go I mean of course we preach we go but it's the fellowship where I really grow when I sit down and and talk to Brothers been there and done that and meet the brothers and hear the testimonies just like brother Ron was saying everybody we talked to had a tremendous testimony coming out of SE ISM coming out of Hinduism coming out of denominationalism coming out of whatever am me just like here when we get together in Fellowship everybody's got a tremendous story and it's a blessing and I feel like it's just a privilege just to be able to meet our brothers and sisters on the other side of the planet and so it was it was wonderful just to see the work that they're doing and how God's blessed it and uh it makes me want to do more for the kingdom of God every time I travel every time I see the brothers every time I witness what they've done I always want to give more it's always made me want to give more always made me want to do more and I don't want to hold back and I don't want to live a selfish life let's all stand we're just going to close we're invite the musicians to come one more thing i' I'd like to say is I thought brother Ron looked pretty good in the suit today yeah and I like the suit I'm wearing both of these suits were a gift from from Brother Samuel go they took us to a tailor shop we weren't expecting it we ate lunch we were going to go to the meetings we stopped and they said brothers let's go in here so brother Ron I we don't know why we're going to shop we going into the shop and it's all nice you know suits and stuff and brother Samuel said we're going to buy you a suit and uh brother Ron kind of stood in the back and he was waiting for me to get fitted for my suit Taylor comes out and measures and the brother said oh no no you're getting a suit too and brings Ron back so I had fun watching brother Ron get fitted for a suit it was a special privilege amen and and so they're so kind so generous with such Hospitality they really know how to treat the bride of Christ and they go all out and I want to be the same way I really I want to treat everybody with respect and kindness and the Bible says you know as much as you have opportunity do good unto all men it says but especially those that are of the household of faith and we were showered upon with hospitality they treated us so good and they were so kind to us but you know what that's the way I want to be I want to treat the the children of God the same way and I said God help me to do a better job help me to have the right attitude help me as brother R is saying help me to live the life that's the Thunder against the devil am the Thunder that shakes the devil is this message lived in flesh this message becoming materialized fleshed out amen it's one thing to know it and say I know it you know it but do you know it know it because if you know it it becom comes translated into aive amen The Knowing is not the knowing but the knowing is the living where the message becomes flesh and your and my flesh amen that's the message alive amen it's not alive because it can be preached that's wonderful that's an anointed preaching we we love that it Thrills us it Thrills something down inside of us amen but what's happening is during the anointed preaching of the word it's waking up the word inside of you the word is connecting to the word to bring more word to life because that's the Thunder that shakes the devil is the word being made manifest remember the devil there was a prophecy and in Isaiah Isaiah chapter 7 said a virgin shall conceive that's the word amen and the devil was trying everything to stop that word from coming to pass right he knew all the way back in Genesis 3 amen that that that the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent so he knows there's a prophecy laying there now a virgin shall conceive and all the way back in the day when Moses was born there was a prophecy of a deliverer and he's always been trying to stop that Prophecy from coming to forth he doesn't want the word to move from prophecy to life so in Moses they killed all the all the baby boys why they're trying to stop the word from coming into manifested word it's bad enough that was that was prophesied word prophesied word is trouble enough for the devil but as long as he can hinder the prophetic word from becoming the manifested word then he still sits in his seat amen still has some semblance of control so what's the devil trying to do he's trying to stop word from becoming manifested word and so what's he trying to do in our lives with all the troubles and all the trials and all the issues and The Temptations and all that he's trying to stop the prophecy that's over your life from becoming manifested prophecy so that we can sit and listen to the word preach and say that was good preaching but then have no manifest station that's where he's trying to work you can sit and hear but hey I want to sit and hear the word so that the word can come to life inside of me that's the Thunder that shakes the devil say God use this Tabernacle of clay I yield it to you what does God need preeminence amen preeminence he needs first place and ultimate control say God I want to surrender myself to you so you can have preeminence so that you can come into this body of Flesh and be the thunder in me that shakes the devil CU we know it's not a life that we can live it's just something we surrender ourselves to that he comes in and he lives himself amen we saw the life lived yes would you testify of that we saw the life lived we saw the effect it has on others the effect it had on us I I just don't want to waste the life that he's given me on this Earth not having an opportunity every day to be thunder that shakes the devil every day I want to surrender myself to Christ so Christ can do something with this Tabernacle of Flesh that I cannot do myself amen I know you're the same way that's why you're here Amen Let say God bless you thank you for praying for us it was a wonderful time it was a wonderful privilege amen and God was certainly good to us let's just bow our heads and pray together dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father for your goodness for your mercy to us Lord I thank you God that we can come and bring a good report from a far away country Lord knowing Lord that the same holy spirit is working here is working there the circumstances may be different in many ways culture and climate and Country and but oh God there's such a

here to say God I want to be one of those vessels that you can use the prophet said you don't have to preach a sermon even without preaching you're preaching and God I want my life to preach a sermon but I know that my own life is not enough I must die to my life so that I can receive your life because your life In Me Is the life that shakes the devil and it does it through sweetness humility reverence Sanctified life God that's what I want to surrender to that's what I want to die to that's what I want to become Lord I pray that you'd help each one of us God give us a greater discernment of your body God help us not to trample over Humanity help us not to become calloused and cold and indifferent when we see suffering Humanity for God there was many you healed that no doubt rejected

of children we want to be let our lives be a blessing to whom all that we can bless and help us especially to bless the household of faith God help us to have greater discernment and help us Lord to be your agents upon this Earth your ambassadors your representatives may we become your lights Lord in this dark world use each one of us Lord that this is more than a mission report this is just a a report sharing what you have done but may it be an encouragement for each one of us to be missionaries to let our light so shine That Others May see the good works and glorify you oh God use us for

your staff almighty God we don't want to get out of the way we want your loving hand we want your correction because the desire inside of us is to walk in your perfect will would you help us oh God as
