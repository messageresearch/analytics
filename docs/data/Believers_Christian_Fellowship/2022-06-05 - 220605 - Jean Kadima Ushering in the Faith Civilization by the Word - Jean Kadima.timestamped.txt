[13:09] update but a chad asked me to give an
[13:11] update to the church
[13:12] about the work that we've been doing in
[13:15] pittsburgh
[13:16] uh
[13:18] the church there it's called pittsburgh
[13:20] believers tabernacle
[13:23] many brothers from pittsburgh area and
[13:26] erie area
[13:28] they just got together and they say
[13:31] let's start something here
[13:33] and the brothers in erie have been very
[13:36] instrumental
[13:38] for that work and they
[13:41] invited me to join them and the response
[13:45] to the world has been very good
[13:49] amen so sometimes the word even discern
[13:53] uh
[13:54] the issues you know
[13:56] just like it does here the same word
[14:00] and sometimes
[14:01] it comes down in tears of denomination
[14:05] views
[14:07] and
[14:08] just like it does here
[14:10] you see sometimes god inspires but the
[14:13] chad and these guys becomes and just
[14:17] smudge everything
[14:19] and you see we go out like
[14:22] i've been spanked today you know
[14:25] spank but happy
[14:29] and that's what the word does over there
[14:31] too and
[14:32] and uh you see people asking me notes
[14:35] after the word has been really hitting
[14:37] hard
[14:38] so
[14:40] give us notes so he was he has been good
[14:46] seeing the response
[14:49] last week we even had a
[14:51] baptism
[14:53] a young man
[14:55] was baptized
[14:57] want some
[14:58] french books
[15:00] you can read english but you want books
[15:02] it doesn't want to go to the internet
[15:05] you want the real book like what a chat
[15:07] say so
[15:08] we're trying to find out those books
[15:11] i left some in boston and
[15:14] have to contact cloverdale to see if
[15:17] they can send him those
[15:20] so
[15:22] we start
[15:23] working with them around
[15:26] october
[15:29] 2001
[15:31] 2021
[15:33] and
[15:35] in march around march i was thinking i
[15:38] say well
[15:40] it will be about six months i will know
[15:43] for sure what direction god wants me to
[15:46] go
[15:47] but just before we get to march they ask
[15:50] me
[15:51] can you continue coming every other week
[15:55] so i did not have my own direct
[15:57] direction so
[15:59] okay
[16:00] let's let's just do it so
[16:03] but around april
[16:06] um
[16:07] they of this year they asked me to be
[16:11] involved in all aspects of the church
[16:15] life
[16:17] so
[16:17] you know how
[16:19] to get a church service like we have now
[16:22] a lot of things are happening
[16:25] behind the scenes
[16:27] and that's they want me to be involved
[16:30] in all these things decision making and
[16:34] services and you know how many services
[16:38] a week
[16:40] should we continue renting here how much
[16:43] it costs can we rent somewhere else
[16:46] counseling
[16:48] all kind of things you know how so it's
[16:51] good
[16:52] um
[16:53] as the lord is leading when is in
[16:57] something is good okay no matter how
[17:00] sometimes it can be challenging but it's
[17:03] good every we we have to make decision
[17:07] with everything sunday school
[17:09] uh website audio visual
[17:15] you know
[17:16] all these things
[17:18] so sometimes
[17:20] uh
[17:21] josie and i
[17:23] come home at
[17:24] midnight after midnight
[17:28] but as long as the children of god are
[17:30] blessed is okay
[17:32] okay so
[17:33] that's what we want to be we want to do
[17:36] his perfect will
[17:38] my
[17:39] prayer if you can pray with me
[17:42] you your prayers have been
[17:46] very important
[17:48] and your support and continue praying
[17:53] i wish
[17:54] that they can grow god can increase them
[17:57] in numbers too
[17:59] so they can put church order
[18:02] and
[18:03] have a pastor
[18:05] because if they have a pastor then that
[18:06] pastor if he needs help then i can go
[18:09] and help it will be much easier
[18:13] so continue praying for me for that so
[18:17] that's all i can say because i'm slow i
[18:20] cannot take too much time
[18:22] i need all the time i need i can't have
[18:25] so
[18:26] maybe we should just stand up and go
[18:29] straight to the world
[18:31] the other day we were at brother ben's
[18:33] house having been the seaboard having
[18:37] the memorial picnic and fellowship
[18:40] the brother said to me
[18:42] this time say something like this time
[18:44] guest ministers will be preaching
[18:50] i say yes guest ministers
[18:53] we welcome them all but they will preach
[18:57] after me
[19:05] ok you see my comeback
[19:08] i have the last word
[19:11] all right let's go to uh
[19:14] the book of first corinthians
[19:17] this is a very
[19:19] ah
[19:20] has so many themes in this
[19:24] portion of scripture
[19:27] so i need you to put your filters and
[19:31] your spiritual jackets because
[19:34] i am just
[19:37] so adventuring
[19:37] taking so much liberty you need your
[19:40] jacket to be to fit you well
[19:43] so
[19:44] ah first corinthians chapter 15
[19:49] 4
[19:50] we start with verse 22
[19:53] for us in adam all die
[19:56] even so in christ shall all be made
[19:59] alive
[20:00] but every man in his own order
[20:04] christ the first fruit of the word the
[20:07] that our christ
[20:10] is coming
[20:11] then
[20:12] cometh the end when he shall have
[20:15] deliver up the kingdom to god
[20:18] even the father
[20:20] when he shall have put down all rule and
[20:23] all authority and power
[20:25] for it shall reign
[20:27] till he had put all enemies under his
[20:30] feet
[20:32] oh my so many things here so let's just
[20:35] continue 26
[20:38] uh the last enemy that shall be
[20:40] destroyed is death
[20:43] for he had put all things under his feet
[20:47] but when he say all things are put under
[20:50] him it is manifest that he is accepted
[20:54] which did put all things under him
[20:58] and when all things shall be subdued
[21:00] unto him then shall the son also himself
[21:04] be subject unto him that pull all things
[21:08] under him that god may be all in all
[21:13] may god bless the reading of the word
[21:16] you may take your seats
[21:19] so greeting again in the name of the
[21:21] lord jesus christ good to be back in the
[21:24] house of the lord
[21:26] are you ready for the word
[21:28] amen so as you can see this uh
[21:33] subject is really loaded with a lot of
[21:37] ingredients
[21:39] so uh i'm going to be a little
[21:42] discipline
[21:46] so you can see here this portion of
[21:49] scripture
[21:50] scriptures uh
[21:52] we read is just fast forwarding
[21:56] everything to the end
[21:59] all right
[22:00] it's just goes back passing everything
[22:04] the body change the resurrection
[22:09] uh
[22:10] what is it the resurrection the the
[22:13] tribulation the millennium
[22:16] is fast forwarding and going to the end
[22:19] we have passed all the things the
[22:21] millennium the gog and magog whatever
[22:24] the earth purified everything then we
[22:28] can even see that the the bride the city
[22:32] is ready to come down and christ has
[22:36] finished his dispensation
[22:39] of redemption
[22:41] and he sit at the throne of god and say
[22:44] i
[22:45] done what you asked me to do
[22:47] and i'm speaking here as a three
[22:49] dimension people we see christ here we
[22:52] see the father here
[22:54] so christ comes to the end and say
[22:58] what you ask me to do
[23:00] i just accomplish it
[23:03] now i want to introduce a new
[23:06] civilization the civilization of faith
[23:09] now
[23:11] amen
[23:12] i've done what you asked me to do now
[23:16] everything is under defeat
[23:19] amen
[23:21] so
[23:22] this is uh it
[23:24] sounds like the future is far off
[23:28] when you read the scripture
[23:30] you say he's gonna put his last enemy
[23:33] death
[23:34] uh
[23:35] it is going to destroy it the enemies
[23:38] will be under the feet it's all sound
[23:41] very far
[23:44] and that's the danger right
[23:46] because before you say something is far
[23:49] away you have to know where you are
[23:53] you cannot just say it's far in time
[23:57] where you are in time
[24:01] amen
[24:02] so that's where we we we're gonna go
[24:05] and just make sure
[24:07] that we don't put things so far away
[24:11] uh they may be happening
[24:16] amen wow
[24:19] so he is what does he do
[24:21] he has shown
[24:26] people
[24:27] the children of god who god is
[24:31] because that the work of christ
[24:34] the anointing word
[24:37] christ is
[24:39] showing to the humanity
[24:41] who is the invisible god
[24:47] that is love is life is all this
[24:52] attributes that you know
[24:54] now that is finishing
[24:57] revealing god's plan and what god is
[25:03] now
[25:04] is going to introduce and is going the
[25:08] bible even say that is going to submit
[25:11] himself to god
[25:15] right
[25:16] and then the fullness of the submission
[25:20] the fullness of submission is when you
[25:22] don't have your mind of your own
[25:26] the fullness of submission
[25:28] is you don't have your own desire
[25:33] him and she
[25:37] are the same because she has his mind
[25:42] and that's why the bible the prophet can
[25:45] say
[25:46] that
[25:47] she hears him because he's a fully
[25:50] totally submissive
[25:53] and when we say christ
[25:56] will be now submissive to
[25:59] god it just mean it goes back to where
[26:03] it was before
[26:06] you get that uh
[26:08] spiritual english
[26:10] he goes back and blend back again as it
[26:15] says in the beginning was the word the
[26:18] word the word was with god the word was
[26:21] god
[26:22] so it's back to where he used to be
[26:27] amen
[26:29] amen
[26:32] praise god
[26:34] let's look at christ
[26:36] brother branham in this message christ
[26:40] um
[26:41] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[26:45] he say now i'm going to give you a
[26:48] little
[26:49] secret
[26:50] till i meet you again remember this as
[26:53] we stand remember this and they start
[26:55] singing
[26:57] at the name of jesus by we said well he
[27:02] just said that i'm gonna give you a
[27:04] little secret right so let's hold him to
[27:07] that as he's singing at the name of
[27:10] jesus bowie
[27:12] i keep singing oh sweet the hope of
[27:15] glory and then what he start giving the
[27:18] secret oh sing again the hope of glory
[27:21] the hope the hope of the earth and joy
[27:23] of heaven and he say everything is
[27:26] manifested in christ
[27:28] god the church everything else is
[27:32] manifest in christ the bible is christ
[27:34] the bible is the written word
[27:38] which is the world its manifestation
[27:42] is the evidence of the life coming into
[27:44] the flesh of the world to manifest it oh
[27:47] it's not
[27:48] wonderful
[27:50] now brother is almost speaking in
[27:51] tongues here
[27:53] so everything that you need everything
[27:57] when you say joy you're talking about
[27:59] christ
[28:00] when you say life you're talking about
[28:02] christ
[28:03] when you talking about anything peace
[28:07] all these things you talking about
[28:08] christ that's why you see the world say
[28:11] i want to make there are so many
[28:13] organizations that want to make the
[28:15] world a better place
[28:17] what they're talking about is christ
[28:20] but they don't want that they want to
[28:22] make the world a better place without
[28:25] christ without the atonement
[28:28] but why do they want to improve things
[28:31] but i'm saying it is because they are
[28:33] sons of god the fallen sons of god
[28:38] but what they're talking about is
[28:40] everything is christ because is the
[28:43] manifestation of the invisible god
[28:48] and that's the little secret that
[28:51] everything is hidden in christ and he is
[28:54] the anointed word of god
[28:59] life salvation redemption everything is
[29:03] in christ is that a secret
[29:07] and christ
[29:10] has been operating
[29:12] from the beginning
[29:14] and now
[29:16] the fullness of christ
[29:19] in human bodies have been manifested
[29:22] and that's a secret
[29:25] a secret coming
[29:27] amen
[29:29] now
[29:32] let's continue paragraph 4
[29:35] 58
[29:37] notice
[29:39] then
[29:40] so
[29:42] what we looking at here is christ has
[29:46] manifested the secret that was in god's
[29:49] mind
[29:51] he has
[29:52] shown
[29:53] to the humanity who god is how what is
[29:57] his plan what is the purpose that was in
[30:00] his mind he has revealed it to us now
[30:05] now we are at the end
[30:07] now he has to introduce a new
[30:11] a new civilization
[30:14] right there
[30:15] now what does he say
[30:20] we can see here
[30:23] he say that notice then one left the
[30:27] first adam and eve
[30:29] before sin separate them in death now
[30:32] christ the second adam in life redeems
[30:37] his bride from death
[30:40] and now on his way back to the original
[30:43] eden restoring back his bride in
[30:46] fellowship
[30:48] back with god as a husband and wife in
[30:51] the garden of eden christ and his bride
[30:56] so this is we really have fast forwarded
[31:00] to the end
[31:02] now christ has done the work the
[31:06] dispensation of redemption is over
[31:10] now he is now
[31:12] back to where he is supposed to be
[31:16] god is
[31:17] plan is where is supposed to be
[31:20] and now christ the second adam
[31:24] is
[31:25] redeem his bride and go sit with the
[31:29] bride and
[31:30] now back to the garden of eden again
[31:34] god now let's see
[31:36] when you look at the uh
[31:38] projection there you see that
[31:41] god
[31:42] is the husband
[31:44] with the wife
[31:45] is it
[31:46] god or is it christ
[31:50] are you with me now christ
[31:53] because the plan of god has always been
[31:56] adam and eve in the garden of eden right
[32:00] so now who is sitting there with the
[32:03] bride is that the christ
[32:05] or it is god
[32:07] is it god the husband or christ the
[32:10] husband
[32:11] god is all in all at this point
[32:15] because everything the redemption period
[32:19] is over
[32:20] now he's taking his place the way god
[32:24] had it in his mind but he needed the
[32:27] function the attribute the manifestation
[32:30] of christ to fulfill it now he fulfill
[32:33] it now now the prophet is talking now is
[32:36] he talking about the husband
[32:39] is he talking about god as if a
[32:43] attribute or is he talking about christ
[32:46] as the attribute are you with me now
[32:49] it's all in all we're back in the
[32:52] blending time
[32:54] amen amen praise god
[32:58] now let's go
[33:00] continue and god and that day the
[33:03] kingdom
[33:05] be given over to the father he will be
[33:09] all in all
[33:10] was it in christ
[33:12] or is it a god i'm talking like kind of
[33:16] a trinitarian
[33:20] to confuse somebody who just pick up
[33:23] something from the message i'm just
[33:25] going like i'm a trinitarian now
[33:29] but that's the way we understand things
[33:32] because we look at things in three
[33:34] dimension so we see god here we see
[33:36] christ here you know
[33:38] so but here i'm just telling you that we
[33:42] are in a different civilization
[33:44] what god had in his mind now is
[33:47] fulfilled he wanted his son and his
[33:50] daughter
[33:52] his son and his wife on the throne now
[33:56] he got it
[33:57] god at that day the kingdom be over to
[34:01] the father
[34:02] he will be all in all
[34:04] while he's yet speaking i will hear now
[34:08] he's talking about that civilization of
[34:10] faith
[34:12] when you you say david christ dave is
[34:15] sitting on the throne the king of the
[34:18] whole human race and why they are yet
[34:21] thinking i will know what they are
[34:24] thinking about
[34:25] before they speak
[34:27] i will answer what a civilization
[34:30] have you noticed that it is not this
[34:34] the civilization of the son of david
[34:38] because the son of david is
[34:40] in the millennium
[34:42] you see is a civilization of david
[34:45] himself christ sitting on the throne and
[34:47] this will be
[34:49] a faith civilization where when you just
[34:53] thinking it i want to have a breakfast
[34:55] with bread and soul and so we got
[34:57] breakfast
[35:00] all of my my eggs are made exactly the
[35:03] way i like them
[35:04] and the coffee and
[35:07] and espresso
[35:12] the
[35:13] roof and the lamb shall feed together
[35:16] the lion shall eat straw like a bullock
[35:20] they shall feed together and lay down
[35:23] they shall no hurt nor destroy
[35:26] in all my holy mountain
[35:29] right back exactly to eden again as hard
[35:33] as he can
[35:34] i can go
[35:36] now the problem is
[35:38] oh that
[35:40] world that civilization
[35:42] is coming but the problem is the prophet
[35:45] told us
[35:47] that
[35:48] he warned us he said this he said man
[35:51] always
[35:53] praise god for what he did
[35:55] and over and over the prophet tells us
[35:59] that he said they they look forward to
[36:02] what is going to there
[36:04] but they ignore what he's doing
[36:07] and we put everything far fetched if our
[36:11] fart away in
[36:13] in the future
[36:15] is it true
[36:17] because as i said
[36:19] you have to know where you are in time
[36:23] so you can say it is far away we we are
[36:26] waiting for it
[36:28] but let me already tell you that it is
[36:31] here
[36:32] amen is here with us because the word
[36:36] the word remember it will be a
[36:39] civilization
[36:40] of faith by the world and the world has
[36:44] been opened today
[36:46] so we have one foot
[36:49] in
[36:51] one foot
[36:52] in that civilization
[36:54] amen
[36:56] that's true
[36:58] i was i had all kind of uh i had
[37:02] different
[37:03] uh titles to my
[37:06] message this morning
[37:08] and i was just waiting god what title
[37:11] because i don't know about other
[37:12] preachers if i don't have it i'm always
[37:15] all over the place
[37:16] okay if i don't have a title
[37:19] i don't i don't know how to focus so i
[37:22] am there and i'm listening to what a
[37:24] child is preaching on wednesday he say
[37:27] i'm ready for the millennium okay all
[37:30] right and you say that i have one foot
[37:33] out already
[37:35] that's it
[37:36] ushering of the faith
[37:39] aftering of the faith civilization by
[37:43] the word
[37:44] because when you have a foot out it
[37:47] means the other foot is not yet
[37:50] so you are in between
[37:52] so the blending of
[37:55] eternity and time
[37:57] amen
[37:58] and that's what we're talking about
[38:01] because of the opening of the seven
[38:04] seals christ himself has to come he is
[38:08] the one who
[38:09] introduced the faith civilization
[38:13] christ himself is the heat did he come
[38:16] did he open the seals therefore the
[38:20] eternity and time are blended together
[38:23] we are just in the ushering
[38:26] amen you know what this ushering
[38:30] the wedding is about to happen
[38:33] it's ushering
[38:35] why is it the wedding
[38:37] yes it's a wedding you may say he's not
[38:40] waiting because the pastor has not said
[38:42] you know
[38:43] you know you married
[38:47] is that right but he said ushering it
[38:49] means we are in that process
[38:53] amen and that's where we are then we
[38:56] cannot put it far away and say it's
[38:59] going to happen
[39:01] because there is a danger
[39:04] someone will say it happened already
[39:07] and you did not know it
[39:09] amen
[39:11] let's look at
[39:12] it the seventh seal
[39:16] everything runs out in this time the end
[39:20] the end of the seventh seal notice is
[39:23] the end of the church age
[39:25] is the end of the seventh seal it's the
[39:28] end of the trumpet it's the end of the
[39:30] vials
[39:31] the end oh and the ushering in the
[39:34] millennium
[39:35] that's on the seventh seal
[39:40] amen
[39:41] paradox the paradox
[39:43] as we realize that we we are closing the
[39:47] time time is running out it's blending
[39:51] in
[39:52] with eternity
[39:54] eternity is that special civilization
[39:58] there's civilization by faith
[40:00] where you say the word something
[40:02] happened and we are at the west coast
[40:06] as uh civilization has traveled is to
[40:09] the west
[40:10] so as the gospel travel with it
[40:13] and now there is no place to go back
[40:16] but
[40:17] to go but
[40:19] back east again it's completed
[40:23] amen
[40:24] ushering in of
[40:27] this faith civilization
[40:31] are you already already there
[40:33] amen
[40:35] amen amen amen
[40:40] amen
[40:42] romans chapter 8
[40:44] 17
[40:46] it says that if children
[40:48] their ears
[40:51] ears of god and
[40:54] joint heir with christ if so
[40:57] be that we suffer with him that we may
[41:00] be also glorified together for i reckon
[41:03] that the sufferings of this present time
[41:06] are not worthy to be compared with the
[41:08] glory which shall be revealed in us
[41:12] oh
[41:13] it could be
[41:14] the glory that will be revealed to us in
[41:17] that civilization that god has so many
[41:21] things that
[41:22] he cannot tell us as we're living in
[41:24] this uh flesh
[41:26] in this dimension that he has a lot but
[41:30] just just remember the
[41:33] glory has also been revealed to us
[41:37] today
[41:38] right now
[41:40] it has the same impact it has something
[41:44] that is taking place
[41:46] it we cannot
[41:48] wait everything to happen at the end
[41:52] it's just like that person who goes into
[41:54] that
[41:55] banquet or that uh
[41:58] supper without the clothes
[42:01] why are you here without the clothes
[42:04] why are you with your denominational
[42:07] mind
[42:09] anyway it's that now
[42:12] it's ushering
[42:14] in that time but you gotta be in the
[42:17] process not wait sometimes someday
[42:21] something will happen
[42:24] do you believe that
[42:26] amen
[42:28] so when god is going to show us that
[42:31] that new civilization what are we going
[42:34] to do are we going to ask him lord how
[42:37] did you create the world
[42:40] um how everything is linked together
[42:43] how all this
[42:47] universe was built
[42:50] no the prophet is telling us maybe we
[42:52] will do that some of us are curious
[42:55] they have a curious mind want to know
[42:58] more
[42:59] but the prophet said that it is an
[43:01] innocence
[43:04] civilization
[43:05] like a children like adam
[43:08] we will just speak
[43:10] and it will happen
[43:12] amen we will we need
[43:15] do we need that do we need to know as
[43:18] the pastor was preaching wednesday do we
[43:21] need to know everything all the details
[43:24] we don't need it all we need to know
[43:26] that the world has the power of
[43:29] transformation
[43:31] the world has a power to create to call
[43:34] into existence
[43:36] amen
[43:38] that's what i will need to know
[43:41] that i'm a creator
[43:43] right now
[43:45] i want to create a good atmosphere
[43:48] around me
[43:50] so people can feel the presence of
[43:52] christ in my life
[43:55] i am a creator now not in the next
[43:58] civilization right now the world does
[44:01] that
[44:03] amen amen
[44:11] set an eden
[44:13] um
[44:14] this is a great time everybody has got
[44:16] money everybody can do this and
[44:18] everybody can do that and money flowing
[44:21] everywhere and big cars and everything
[44:23] there won't be one of them in that city
[44:26] no cars okay there won't be a one car
[44:29] one plane no it's all be
[44:32] to be all to get a different
[44:33] civilization it will be again a
[44:36] civilization not of knowledge not of
[44:39] science but of innocence a faith in the
[44:43] living god
[44:46] probably i will not ask him the
[44:49] mechanism of everything how the dna
[44:54] all right because it will be innocence
[44:57] just pick the thing happen i don't care
[45:00] about how they all link
[45:02] together right
[45:04] because that is the civilization of
[45:07] today where they want to know the
[45:09] mechanism
[45:11] and what they do is they try to do a
[45:14] reverse
[45:16] engineering that they go from a product
[45:21] they create another product based on
[45:23] that product by looking how it is done
[45:27] but that's not our civilization we go by
[45:30] the word
[45:32] and get the result
[45:34] amen
[45:35] but this
[45:37] engineer reverse engineering is just
[45:40] like two people
[45:42] go and eat a good meal have a good dish
[45:45] and they go back they they start
[45:48] figuring out
[45:49] how it was made
[45:51] i think
[45:53] i tasted some tomato there
[45:56] some parmesan no no it was it was swiss
[46:00] cheese
[46:01] they go back there why don't you just go
[46:04] ask for the recipe
[46:07] okay well you can still eat something
[46:10] you can still make up something and eat
[46:13] and although the kids will say ah man it
[46:16] was egg so
[46:18] but you can eat it
[46:21] why don't you just go ask the owner
[46:24] he conceived it he thought about it and
[46:27] then made it why don't you go and ask
[46:30] for some reason they don't want
[46:33] they want to reverse engineering
[46:36] but if it's a recipe is okay but what
[46:39] about is about your life
[46:44] don't you want to go and ask the one who
[46:47] conceived it
[46:52] so
[46:53] the civilization of innocence is good
[46:57] we know everything we know all things
[46:59] but we don't know everything
[47:01] and we don't care about it because we
[47:03] can just speak and it will appear i
[47:06] don't know what is the mechanism that's
[47:10] what faith does
[47:12] yes
[47:15] power of transformation
[47:20] so god
[47:21] is great one great kingdom that is to
[47:24] come
[47:25] we will have a civilization but it's not
[47:28] be anything like this it won't be by
[47:31] science
[47:32] it will be a faith civilization by the
[47:35] world
[47:36] the science civilization we have is
[47:39] exactly satan trapped
[47:42] that's what he has killed the people
[47:44] with it that's what is killing us every
[47:48] day with it
[47:53] they tried to play god
[47:56] in their lads no wonder the prophets
[48:00] saw them
[48:01] trying to
[48:03] uh
[48:04] to mix up things say to them stop that
[48:07] stop that and they did not want to maybe
[48:10] they were like brother abraham was
[48:12] saying they were checking the message
[48:15] and criticizing it
[48:20] watch man
[48:22] what of the day the night oh my friend
[48:25] listen to us thus saith the lord if you
[48:28] consider me to be a servant
[48:31] it's just before the break of day
[48:35] what uh
[48:36] that is why this horrible gloom is over
[48:40] the earth it's just before the coming of
[48:42] the lord jesus
[48:44] there is no more hope let
[48:47] left in nothing but is coming
[48:50] [Music]
[48:51] nations are against nations and
[48:54] they have a full through god's
[48:57] laboratory till they got the power to
[49:00] blow one another into atomic ashes
[49:05] and they are wicked and they are and
[49:07] religious and they are on la and
[49:10] christian like and the only mod if they
[49:13] have an
[49:14] object is to destroy they they are
[49:16] inspired by the destroying angel that
[49:19] was sent from heaven to inspire
[49:22] this man
[49:25] i want the original
[49:27] and this morning i want you to
[49:29] to
[49:31] to be glad
[49:32] that god gave you the original
[49:35] that will
[49:37] can create
[49:38] that can change things it can provide
[49:41] joy peace and everything without the
[49:44] reverse engineering
[49:46] you have the recipe
[49:48] it is the word of god
[49:51] rejoice for it
[49:53] no matter what the devil says rejoice
[49:55] for it you have the original
[49:58] all you need
[50:00] is to give it water
[50:02] amen to give it light to
[50:05] plant it in a good atmosphere
[50:09] amen
[50:10] but it's going to reproduce according to
[50:13] his own kind
[50:15] the kind of god
[50:17] what god is is what that seed gene is in
[50:21] you
[50:22] amen it doesn't need to to
[50:25] manufacture anything
[50:28] it is there
[50:29] give it the word
[50:31] continue obeying to the word
[50:33] amen
[50:35] so brother bernham keep talking about
[50:36] this people science has brought into god
[50:39] the great laboratory until they're going
[50:42] to destroy themselves maybe with their
[50:44] biological weapon but i i i'm talking
[50:48] about this so you can see
[50:50] that this civilization
[50:53] is a fumbling in god
[50:55] a great laboratory and they trying to do
[50:59] things in reverse but you have
[51:02] everything that created heaven and earth
[51:06] in you yet the devil tells you how
[51:09] miserable you are i feel sorry about
[51:12] yourself
[51:13] but you have all this power in you that
[51:17] need to be unleashed
[51:19] it is dormant it got to be unleashed
[51:22] just keep watering it
[51:25] amen
[51:27] because we don't need we don't need to
[51:30] know the mechanism because the bible
[51:32] says hebrews 11
[51:34] 3 through faith we understand that the
[51:37] world were framed by the word of god
[51:41] so that things which are seen were not
[51:44] made of things which do appear so we
[51:47] cannot start
[51:49] manufacturing it reverse engineering it
[51:53] no
[51:54] that's why
[51:55] they fail
[51:57] now
[51:58] the
[51:59] man is killing man
[52:02] amen and what happened
[52:06] to scientific world
[52:08] happened to the denominational world
[52:11] same thing same concept
[52:14] they went fumbling in god lab they
[52:17] almost break in god's lab
[52:20] to see
[52:21] how can we clone this but abandonment
[52:24] was not against
[52:26] researching for
[52:28] a cancer care
[52:30] cure for example
[52:32] he never it did not say that but what
[52:35] they doing if the prophet saw them and
[52:38] told them to stop it must be bad
[52:41] amen
[52:42] but what they did is exactly what the
[52:46] nomination or
[52:49] system has done
[52:52] so you can be glad and rejoice and
[52:55] praise god for having the original
[52:58] they did what science did
[53:01] they did what is done in the physical
[53:03] world
[53:05] what they did is they try also to fumble
[53:10] in god word
[53:12] to figure out things
[53:16] amen
[53:17] the prophet says here
[53:20] in spiritual food in due season
[53:27] then back out there
[53:29] uh
[53:30] at the beginning of the seven season
[53:31] when those seven angels come down in
[53:34] that pyramid form stood there and told
[53:37] me to return back here and speak on
[53:39] those seven seals and he would be with
[53:42] me he would show me what they were the
[53:45] lost things
[53:47] i always thought it was a seal on the
[53:50] back of the book and it will be
[53:52] something that was not written
[53:54] in the book but
[53:57] it turned out that it was made known
[53:59] that it cannot do that is not something
[54:02] that is written in the book it's
[54:04] something that's been hid
[54:06] in the book
[54:08] for whosoever shall take one word from
[54:11] it and add one word to it so it's it's a
[54:15] mystery that's been in the book in this
[54:18] seven church ages
[54:20] each one of them produce a mystery and
[54:23] all about water baptism and this
[54:27] other things that they've
[54:30] fumbled about so long
[54:33] oh they fumble
[54:35] reverse engineering things
[54:38] trying here trying there sometimes it
[54:41] works sometimes it doesn't work the
[54:44] baptist
[54:45] fumbled and found that yeah you
[54:49] you need the baptism in the water but
[54:52] they keep using the title
[54:55] yeah the jesus only say no
[54:58] it must be jesus
[55:00] but they use jesus as one god as one
[55:03] unit
[55:05] they're kind of
[55:07] close breaking in god lab
[55:11] yeah it kind of works it doesn't work
[55:14] you gotta go to the the one who
[55:16] conceived the idea the one who had a
[55:20] thought in his mind
[55:22] amen the prophet says here in the breach
[55:26] he say that it's hid now remember no man
[55:30] in heaven no man in earth
[55:32] pope bishop cardinal state presbyter and
[55:36] whosoever
[55:38] whoever he is
[55:39] can break them sees and reveal the book
[55:43] but the land
[55:45] and we have probed this we
[55:49] is not a royal we
[55:51] because the prophet did not do that
[55:54] are you with me the prophet did not do
[55:56] that when he probes god comes revealed
[55:59] to him because the word of god is
[56:02] revealed to the prophet and we have
[56:04] probed and presumed stumble the wonder
[56:08] that the reason we are in such a
[56:11] confusion
[56:12] man
[56:14] message believers
[56:17] we cannot continue this way we have the
[56:20] original
[56:22] let
[56:23] water the original
[56:24] let us
[56:26] use the original
[56:28] let
[56:29] stay with the original it shall
[56:32] reproduce according to god law of
[56:35] reproduction amen
[56:38] amen
[56:40] if it is god's word it shall reproduce
[56:44] god in you
[56:46] amen
[56:47] there is no question about it
[56:50] amen
[56:51] but if we stumble we try here we try
[56:54] there we keep our
[56:56] denominator
[56:58] system mentality
[57:03] then
[57:04] it is hybridization it will not
[57:07] reproduce
[57:08] thank god i'm speaking to an audience
[57:11] that knows him
[57:14] in the truth
[57:16] in the spirit
[57:17] amen
[57:20] now as i'm talking about this let me
[57:25] take some more liberty
[57:27] here
[57:29] and read this first corinthians 10 11.
[57:34] now all these things happen unto them
[57:36] for examples
[57:38] they are written for admonition upon
[57:41] whom the end of the world are calm
[57:45] and sometimes i
[57:46] i uh
[57:48] i need just to be careful that anything
[57:51] that i say
[57:52] will not be constructed as
[57:55] criticism or success or putting somebody
[57:59] down or
[58:01] but the bible say if there is something
[58:04] in the message there
[58:05] it was written for us
[58:07] so we can learn from it
[58:09] amen
[58:11] we who have come to the ends
[58:14] we have arrived
[58:17] to the end
[58:19] in our time
[58:21] no more
[58:23] shadow
[58:24] no more type
[58:26] everything is a reality
[58:29] there is no other
[58:31] group other people that will use us as a
[58:35] type
[58:37] everything has come to the end therefore
[58:40] whatever happened in brother branham's
[58:43] life
[58:44] can
[58:45] be used for our instruction
[58:48] that's what i want i want to show you
[58:50] how how uh the the denomination
[58:54] miss
[58:56] missed to see the origin
[58:59] and they went
[59:00] fondly
[59:03] finding something
[59:05] else
[59:06] but
[59:07] for you and i let
[59:09] it be an encouragement that what you
[59:12] have received is the truth and it shall
[59:16] reproduce according to his own kind
[59:19] amen
[59:21] i don't want just to wait for that
[59:23] civilization to come
[59:25] i want it now
[59:27] amen i want it now i want to create i am
[59:32] a creator you are too
[59:35] i want to create a good atmosphere
[59:37] around me
[59:38] that's something i need
[59:40] there are so many things in our life
[59:42] that will help us to display christ
[59:45] better i want it now that civilization
[59:48] will come but i am already in it i am
[59:51] it is ushering of that civilization
[59:55] right now
[59:56] amen
[1:00:00] is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:00:03] and i say
[1:00:04] this is about brother uh tommy osborne
[1:00:08] remember brother branham talks so many
[1:00:11] good things about tommy
[1:00:13] you know that all over the message you
[1:00:16] just hear about him
[1:00:18] and how he brother branham really love
[1:00:20] him really love him and he also say good
[1:00:24] things about brother branham choose
[1:00:27] but that's something something there
[1:00:30] there's something that just sharing with
[1:00:33] you there and you say i say come out of
[1:00:37] him satan he just fell backward and
[1:00:40] pinned my feet right on to the floor
[1:00:42] he's talking about the maniac of oregon
[1:00:45] now he said uh god is god a good god
[1:00:50] brother branham that's all
[1:00:52] say i've made myself nail in the house
[1:00:56] for two or three days that's better
[1:00:59] tommy osborne
[1:01:01] i don't pull no pantries he will tell
[1:01:05] he will tell about it he's not the shame
[1:01:08] of it say you think i got a gift of
[1:01:12] healing
[1:01:15] i say forget it tommy you were sent to
[1:01:19] preach the gospel
[1:01:20] go preach it go with by the both wolves
[1:01:23] there
[1:01:25] so many times brother brennan when he
[1:01:27] talks about this story
[1:01:30] about tommy osborne is always he talk
[1:01:32] about the maniac of oregon
[1:01:35] but when you hear brother tommy osborne
[1:01:38] himself talking about it he say
[1:01:42] when he saw brother branham
[1:01:44] holding a
[1:01:46] girl
[1:01:47] a little girl
[1:01:49] and say
[1:01:51] you
[1:01:52] demon or spirit of dumb and
[1:01:58] you spirit of
[1:02:00] the the the kid could not speak
[1:02:03] so
[1:02:04] he he rebuked that spirit with a soft
[1:02:09] uh voice
[1:02:11] and just speak to it
[1:02:13] come out of this girl without any noise
[1:02:16] that spirit came out
[1:02:19] and brother
[1:02:21] tommy osborne was like oh i need the
[1:02:24] same thing
[1:02:26] so he went and
[1:02:28] locked himself in the room for three
[1:02:30] days
[1:02:32] and after that he went
[1:02:35] and did the same thing
[1:02:39] and the miracles have started happening
[1:02:43] and he went back to brother branham and
[1:02:45] says
[1:02:46] brother branham do you think
[1:02:48] i have
[1:02:50] a gift of healing
[1:02:52] listen to the prophet
[1:02:54] he said forget about it
[1:02:58] if i go to the prophet
[1:03:02] and i'm so excited
[1:03:05] that
[1:03:06] god did something to me
[1:03:08] or for me and he said to me
[1:03:11] forget about it should not i forget
[1:03:14] about it
[1:03:18] i should
[1:03:20] forget about it
[1:03:22] but he did not
[1:03:25] jesus sent me yesterday today and
[1:03:27] forever
[1:03:28] i have a little uh friend a little
[1:03:31] pentecostal brother
[1:03:33] was one of the my converts to divine
[1:03:36] healing was tommy osborne
[1:03:38] i don't know whether you ever known
[1:03:41] him or not very lovely fine brother
[1:03:45] if he ever comes through this country
[1:03:48] but put your arms around him and hug him
[1:03:50] for me he's really a wonderful little
[1:03:53] brother and many other
[1:03:56] other my brothers too all of them are
[1:03:59] but i mean just speaking of tommy when
[1:04:02] he come to me he was a little nervous
[1:04:04] like a fellow he was a very nice
[1:04:07] person
[1:04:09] he probably is i don't know if he's
[1:04:11] alive or what he has a family as
[1:04:13] children
[1:04:15] grandchildren is wonderful but this is
[1:04:17] for our example
[1:04:19] this is to teach us something you know
[1:04:22] when he sold the products
[1:04:25] he wants to replicate the product
[1:04:28] but you gotta go to the original
[1:04:32] to where it was conceived
[1:04:36] are you with me and sometimes we still
[1:04:39] see the same thing
[1:04:41] let's go to the world and the rest will
[1:04:45] follow
[1:04:46] let's start with the word and the rest
[1:04:49] will be given to us as god himself
[1:04:53] decide to give to us then he will give
[1:04:56] it to us
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:02] he started he ran
[1:05:04] around his car two or three times just
[1:05:06] after this port
[1:05:08] portland meeting up here he's seen that
[1:05:11] maniac being taken down by the power of
[1:05:14] god and he said oh he said brother
[1:05:16] branham you think i got a gift of
[1:05:20] healing i say tommy honey
[1:05:23] don't think about that see i say you
[1:05:27] know you are a preacher yes i say you
[1:05:31] know what you know the word of god will
[1:05:33] defeat satan anywhere any place any time
[1:05:37] any on any condition
[1:05:39] that's right the word of god that's
[1:05:42] right
[1:05:44] well brother barajan but god told buddha
[1:05:48] branham to bring this gift of healing to
[1:05:51] to the people of the world
[1:05:54] yes but how
[1:05:56] he preached the word then the miracles
[1:05:59] happened
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:07] amen
[1:06:09] they will not read the message
[1:06:11] you and i will read the message
[1:06:13] the message community will read the
[1:06:15] message we listen to the tapes
[1:06:18] so these things are for us for example
[1:06:22] that if you plan the word stay with the
[1:06:26] world
[1:06:27] you will never regret that decision
[1:06:33] the commission of god was
[1:06:36] we said first the commission was
[1:06:40] the healing
[1:06:41] the discernment the gift but
[1:06:44] that's i can
[1:06:46] beg to defer a little bit
[1:06:48] because
[1:06:50] the first commission was in 1933
[1:06:53] on the ohio river
[1:06:57] as john the baptist was sent that was
[1:07:00] the commission
[1:07:02] and if you are a minister you are
[1:07:05] entitled to pray for the sick
[1:07:08] but start with the word
[1:07:12] plant the seed
[1:07:14] the word
[1:07:15] then god is obligated to do whatever you
[1:07:18] want to do
[1:07:20] whatever you want you to manifest it
[1:07:22] will manifest it but start with the word
[1:07:26] not with the gift don't reverse
[1:07:28] engineering it
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:41] so i encourage you
[1:07:43] start with the word
[1:07:45] continue power
[1:07:47] god's power to transform and every
[1:07:50] and every everything under control to
[1:07:52] bring forth
[1:07:54] of its kind
[1:07:57] what kind kind of the word
[1:07:59] if you have the word then god will
[1:08:01] decide what he is going to give to you
[1:08:04] but start with the word
[1:08:06] simple message you turn out
[1:08:09] for the audience
[1:08:11] it's like a choir
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:14] do you agree with me
[1:08:15] now remember to bring when he put the
[1:08:18] seed the seed in the earth
[1:08:21] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:08:24] power of life within it to transform it
[1:08:27] from a seed to a plant and whatever it
[1:08:30] was
[1:08:31] is transforming power
[1:08:34] now god
[1:08:36] now god put the seed in there with
[1:08:39] potential that it will be
[1:08:41] what he say it will be
[1:08:44] start with the world and as long as it
[1:08:47] stay in this right category it will be
[1:08:51] just exactly what god said it will be
[1:08:55] it had to be what
[1:08:57] that way because he had made it that way
[1:09:00] and made a channel
[1:09:03] amen
[1:09:04] that any uh that let's continue
[1:09:08] that anything that stays in his channel
[1:09:12] in his line of word it will have to
[1:09:15] bring forth exactly like his word say it
[1:09:18] will do it cannot move from there it
[1:09:21] channeled
[1:09:23] just exactly right
[1:09:26] so with everything in the trust in his
[1:09:29] own son
[1:09:30] that it would be that way then god say
[1:09:34] it's all good so i will just
[1:09:37] rest and each one of those seed has
[1:09:40] power in itself to transform itself into
[1:09:43] the species and i desire it to be that's
[1:09:47] what it must be because i've given every
[1:09:50] seed transforming power to make out of
[1:09:54] itself and its potential now to make out
[1:09:58] of itself exactly what i want it to be
[1:10:02] don't you just want
[1:10:05] it to be what god want is yes
[1:10:11] i want this gift that the prophet has
[1:10:17] start with the word
[1:10:20] the prophet says you want a church start
[1:10:22] with the word
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:27] hallelujah
[1:10:29] so this is an encouragement awfully
[1:10:33] for all of us
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:36] an encouragement that tells us that
[1:10:39] let's start with that seed
[1:10:42] is planted
[1:10:44] does he have water
[1:10:46] the water of the washing of the wood
[1:10:49] let's make sure that the water comes
[1:10:52] well the water comes
[1:10:54] it's being absorbed right and how is it
[1:10:57] absorbed because we obey to the word
[1:11:00] and then yes you have received the word
[1:11:04] yes then you have
[1:11:06] water it
[1:11:08] yes
[1:11:09] does he have light
[1:11:10] are you feeling are you giving it light
[1:11:13] what is the light
[1:11:15] the word the anointed word of your time
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] it does is already fertilized
[1:11:24] it doesn't need really fertilizer
[1:11:28] it doesn't need a repellent
[1:11:30] because you are made to repel all these
[1:11:33] false doctrine and things away from you
[1:11:36] all this unbelief away from you
[1:11:39] let's just make sure it doesn't hurt to
[1:11:42] go to the lord and say am i in the faith
[1:11:46] because there is a civilization that is
[1:11:49] coming is the civilization of faith am i
[1:11:52] in a faith do am i do i obey your word
[1:11:58] and that's not an effort that's just
[1:12:01] absorbing it and say yes lord i believe
[1:12:04] it
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] and if that happened
[1:12:11] if that happened
[1:12:13] something will take place whatever god
[1:12:16] wants to take place
[1:12:18] we will still be living in this sticky
[1:12:21] nature that we have but something
[1:12:24] there inside will continue taking place
[1:12:29] i remember brother branham crossing that
[1:12:32] place where there was a ball
[1:12:37] he is
[1:12:38] and that story about the ball i did not
[1:12:41] hear brother banam say this is a
[1:12:43] ministry
[1:12:45] this is just for a prophet
[1:12:48] this will happen only
[1:12:50] uh for the prophet
[1:12:52] he never say that
[1:12:54] it must be for all of us
[1:12:57] amen and that's what i want
[1:13:01] not to perform necessary miracle
[1:13:04] but the control of situations
[1:13:07] is
[1:13:08] god in you
[1:13:10] how many situations we come across how
[1:13:12] many times i felt like i failed
[1:13:16] but christ control situations
[1:13:20] christ and me should control even in
[1:13:23] this sticky nature fallen nature is
[1:13:26] still have the power to control
[1:13:30] situations
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:39] he is
[1:13:39] telling that story
[1:13:42] and then when i started across the field
[1:13:46] right out in the big open field and not
[1:13:49] over about 30 yards from me
[1:13:53] this big fellow raised up and threw his
[1:13:56] horns down and let out a big bellow and
[1:14:01] if you know what i'm talking about
[1:14:04] there he was horns about like this and
[1:14:07] here he come at first it scared me
[1:14:12] i look for a tree then there was no any
[1:14:15] three i looked it could uh
[1:14:18] oh oh around me to the fence and i
[1:14:22] thought well this is it so then
[1:14:25] something happened
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] i wanna i i wanna
[1:14:33] we know this story we read it we listen
[1:14:35] to it over and over and over again right
[1:14:39] but let me just uh you know stress
[1:14:42] something here
[1:14:44] when buddha balaam saw this ball
[1:14:47] he knew the danger
[1:14:50] it was not reckless it was not like i am
[1:14:54] the prophet of god and nothing will
[1:14:56] happen to me
[1:14:57] no he act just the way you and i will
[1:15:01] act in face of danger
[1:15:04] the first thing he did was to try to
[1:15:07] find his
[1:15:08] gun right
[1:15:11] maybe the second thing was when he found
[1:15:14] that he left his gun in the truck
[1:15:17] so oh
[1:15:18] because he was thinking i'm gonna kill
[1:15:20] it and then i'm gonna pay the owner
[1:15:23] just like you and i
[1:15:25] living a normal life
[1:15:29] and then when he saw that they the gun
[1:15:31] was not there he looked at the fence the
[1:15:34] fence was far off
[1:15:36] so i cannot go there
[1:15:39] he looked there was no tree for so he
[1:15:42] can climb
[1:15:44] are you even
[1:15:46] then he did not know
[1:15:48] what else to do then he just say i don't
[1:15:51] want to be
[1:15:52] i don't want to die like a coward
[1:15:55] i'm not going to cry
[1:15:58] so he just did everything like you and i
[1:16:04] and then he says something happened
[1:16:08] i want that something amen
[1:16:11] because it's the same word
[1:16:14] he has the same he believed the same
[1:16:17] word
[1:16:18] he wanted the same word
[1:16:20] and he said something happened if you
[1:16:23] ask me that something happened did not
[1:16:26] come from outside
[1:16:29] that something was already inside
[1:16:32] he did not know he was dormant in him
[1:16:36] he just used his human mind just you
[1:16:40] like you and i
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] what he did i will tell you
[1:16:48] you want to clam
[1:16:50] up
[1:16:50] a
[1:16:52] tree of knowledge
[1:16:54] that's what he did
[1:16:57] the dangers coming
[1:16:59] are
[1:17:00] gone
[1:17:01] tree of knowledge
[1:17:04] a tree tree of knowledge
[1:17:08] a fast tree of knowledge
[1:17:11] then he found that it doesn't work
[1:17:13] then
[1:17:14] god
[1:17:16] came on the scene
[1:17:18] but i would not say he was outside
[1:17:21] something within himself
[1:17:25] that seed gene that you have been
[1:17:27] watering
[1:17:29] was dormant
[1:17:31] in the right time
[1:17:34] it came to manifestation
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] something happened i want that
[1:17:43] and he could speak now
[1:17:46] to the ball
[1:17:47] and say oh i am a servant of god
[1:17:52] adam restore
[1:17:54] eve restore on earth
[1:17:57] eve did not fear anymore
[1:18:00] in that civilization you won't fear
[1:18:02] anymore
[1:18:04] is that right but don't put it far away
[1:18:07] because it happened to brother branham
[1:18:09] here
[1:18:10] he did not fear it was not way in the
[1:18:14] future it was right here it did not
[1:18:18] manufacture it
[1:18:20] it happened like naturally
[1:18:23] that's what i needed
[1:18:24] that's what i'm asking
[1:18:27] that's what i'm watering the world
[1:18:30] so that it can
[1:18:32] whatever god want because in my life
[1:18:35] i've seen a lot of bulls
[1:18:38] ferocious bulls
[1:18:41] did not you is that am i alone
[1:18:44] and they come you see they're coming
[1:18:47] and you can discern them you can see
[1:18:49] them coming you can discern what they're
[1:18:53] going to do they're coming like a
[1:18:55] hurricane maybe they will come in your
[1:18:58] personal life maybe they're coming to
[1:19:00] attack your family and you are there you
[1:19:04] don't know what to do
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] will not be good that god takes over
[1:19:13] because you can discern it you can say
[1:19:16] it is this
[1:19:17] the purpose is to do this
[1:19:19] it's like a hurricane he's going to take
[1:19:21] everything
[1:19:23] is that right
[1:19:25] but
[1:19:27] you deserve it
[1:19:29] but what can you do about it
[1:19:31] is not you
[1:19:33] who have to do
[1:19:35] is god
[1:19:36] if he wants me to go through this
[1:19:38] hurricane i will go through it
[1:19:40] amen if you want to stop it he will stop
[1:19:44] it amen what is happening is christ in
[1:19:48] you will act and control the situation
[1:19:53] when you need it
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:56] i don't know how to say it in the way of
[1:20:02] uh learned educated uh but in a
[1:20:07] terminology but i'm not speaking to
[1:20:09] intellect i'm speaking to the soul
[1:20:13] christ the word is speaking to the soul
[1:20:15] you grab you understand what i'm talking
[1:20:18] about
[1:20:19] amen
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:23] it is not about theology
[1:20:26] it's the word of god
[1:20:28] and god i felt so many times yes i'm
[1:20:32] still living in this nature
[1:20:34] yes i will do like by the branham but do
[1:20:36] you remember when god
[1:20:39] came on the scene a jump from the tree
[1:20:43] of knowledge to the tree of life right
[1:20:46] there the gun is not working the fence
[1:20:49] is not working then he jump on the tree
[1:20:52] of life he he did not care about what is
[1:20:56] happening he has no fear god took over
[1:21:00] oh god if that could only stay there
[1:21:03] instead of going away something happened
[1:21:07] i wish god will let it happen to
[1:21:09] everybody here tonight just long enough
[1:21:13] to get here
[1:21:15] something happened
[1:21:16] i wasn't scared of the bull i felt sorry
[1:21:21] because i disturbed him i was in his
[1:21:23] field he was laying out there not
[1:21:26] bothering me
[1:21:28] i come along and walk him or came up and
[1:21:31] so i i felt sorry for him now you can't
[1:21:35] bluff it it has to be there where there
[1:21:40] that's the way faith is you can't bluff
[1:21:43] it you've got to really have it
[1:21:47] sometimes you can discern it
[1:21:49] because the prophet says
[1:21:51] when when that bull comes in your life
[1:21:55] you can discern it because you are a
[1:21:57] child of god
[1:21:58] and the prophet says that
[1:22:02] our eternal destiny
[1:22:04] is depend on our discernment we do about
[1:22:08] what we see and what we hear
[1:22:12] we can discern it but it takes god to
[1:22:15] come on the scene
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:20] i don't see where brother but i'm saying
[1:22:22] the word of god says in the face of
[1:22:25] danger you have to do this no it came
[1:22:28] naturally sometimes the bulls can be
[1:22:32] somebody who's really angry at you
[1:22:36] oh what can you do well but ibn
[1:22:39] something came on the scene he look and
[1:22:44] say
[1:22:45] i am a son of adam restore
[1:22:49] i know adam gave you a name
[1:22:52] you are a boy he gave you a name and he
[1:22:56] gave you a place
[1:22:57] he replaces you
[1:23:00] he just did not just give you a name but
[1:23:04] he called you when god gave you a name
[1:23:08] he placed you somewhere like the
[1:23:10] patriarch the women of jacob they call
[1:23:14] the children name and they place them in
[1:23:17] their property
[1:23:19] and god gave you the bull he gave you
[1:23:23] your territory he gave you turf i
[1:23:26] disturb it but i'm a son of god i will i
[1:23:30] i need to respect your environment your
[1:23:35] turf i made a mistake forgive me i'm a
[1:23:38] servant of god
[1:23:40] oh god
[1:23:42] oh
[1:23:43] back to that civilization again
[1:23:46] back to the civilization amen i want
[1:23:49] that i i
[1:23:51] just want that
[1:23:53] so because it will come
[1:23:56] this vicious
[1:23:58] bulls will come
[1:24:00] but we have to have that security
[1:24:03] in christ
[1:24:04] amen and it has to become a natural it's
[1:24:08] not like
[1:24:10] they come they attack you maybe it's a
[1:24:12] colleague maybe it's him
[1:24:15] you lucky if i was not a christian
[1:24:19] you're lucky no no i want it to be
[1:24:22] natural i forgive you
[1:24:25] i understand
[1:24:27] you feel insecure
[1:24:29] you feel like i'm being promoted you
[1:24:31] feel like violated you feel like this
[1:24:34] and that i understand i'm a child of
[1:24:38] prosperity
[1:24:40] if i'm in this company
[1:24:42] god blesses this company
[1:24:46] i'm not here to take your place because
[1:24:48] i own everything
[1:24:56] hallelujah ah praise god
[1:25:06] and we pray
[1:25:08] that you will honor tonight your servant
[1:25:12] and the prayer that we make to you the
[1:25:15] songs that we sing
[1:25:16] and
[1:25:17] bless the word lord and as it goes forth
[1:25:22] made to really fall on fertile ground
[1:25:25] right at this our lord we pray that you
[1:25:29] will
[1:25:30] pull out every greenbriar every root of
[1:25:34] bitterness and all this belief from the
[1:25:38] heart of your people
[1:25:40] that the world might fall on good rich
[1:25:43] fertilized soil that will bring forth
[1:25:46] great results to these people
[1:25:49] that's the origin
[1:25:51] the
[1:25:52] original that the thing
[1:25:56] so
[1:25:57] just make sure
[1:25:58] is there any bitterness
[1:26:01] the word
[1:26:02] cannot grow under that atmosphere that
[1:26:06] circumstance
[1:26:07] remove that bitterness the prophet say
[1:26:10] go to your knees until the bitterness is
[1:26:12] gone
[1:26:14] oh man that disbelief
[1:26:17] satan i don't believe what you say i
[1:26:20] stay with the word of god if even if i
[1:26:23] don't understand it i stay with it
[1:26:29] the soil fertilized
[1:26:31] good and rich it is good and rich the
[1:26:35] soil is good and rich that's why god
[1:26:39] came and planted a seed
[1:26:42] now all we need is just to give it more
[1:26:45] room or water just keep doing it in the
[1:26:49] time that god decided to use it
[1:26:53] don't
[1:26:54] he should have the liberty to do it
[1:26:57] you see
[1:26:58] he's a gentleman the holy ghost is a
[1:27:00] gentleman he doesn't force himself in us
[1:27:05] is that right
[1:27:07] he doesn't force himself in us
[1:27:11] he's waiting for us
[1:27:13] therefore
[1:27:14] if i go to him and say lord
[1:27:17] am i pleasing you
[1:27:20] that's the word find the room in man
[1:27:23] it's not something wrong
[1:27:26] it's not an effort
[1:27:27] it's not like i'm trying to do it
[1:27:31] it is i want to be sure
[1:27:34] and he loved that time of fellowship
[1:27:37] with him when you ask him
[1:27:40] i just want to please you father
[1:27:43] that's the word find a place
[1:27:46] is there any portion that i don't oh
[1:27:49] play
[1:27:51] because i want when the time comes
[1:27:54] i want you to do what
[1:27:56] you want to do in man
[1:27:59] when the time
[1:28:00] of test came
[1:28:02] when brother branham was told to curse
[1:28:05] those kids that were kissing in the
[1:28:09] church
[1:28:10] making fun of the word
[1:28:13] god control the situation in him
[1:28:17] i want to pass that type of test
[1:28:21] i
[1:28:22] need to pass the test where i know the
[1:28:25] time to
[1:28:28] speak out
[1:28:30] and the time to keep silence
[1:28:33] is that what the word say ecclesiastes 3
[1:28:37] a time to rend
[1:28:39] a time to sow
[1:28:40] a time to keep silence and the time to
[1:28:43] speak
[1:28:47] i want that
[1:28:49] control of the situation
[1:28:54] every many times
[1:28:56] i fell but if christ isn't me
[1:29:00] the world
[1:29:01] i wanted to be able to take over
[1:29:06] and stop me from speaking and saying
[1:29:09] anything for that situation
[1:29:12] because the test is not to say anything
[1:29:15] but the test can be also you have to
[1:29:18] speak up now
[1:29:19] if you don't speak out
[1:29:22] you have just compromised
[1:29:25] i need it to be him not me
[1:29:28] i know i don't need it to be for vain
[1:29:31] glory but for his glory
[1:29:34] are you with me church amen amen
[1:29:38] yet i'm still living in this nature
[1:29:41] but yet i'm victorious now
[1:29:48] the power of the enemy under our feet
[1:29:52] now
[1:29:53] not in the future
[1:29:56] anyway christ does not have feet
[1:30:00] he has your feet
[1:30:02] therefore the power of the enemy are
[1:30:05] under your feet
[1:30:07] because he is the head and you are the
[1:30:10] body
[1:30:16] matthew 10 19
[1:30:19] but when they deliver you up
[1:30:22] take no thought on
[1:30:24] how what ye shall speak
[1:30:27] for it shall be given you in the same
[1:30:30] hour
[1:30:31] that it shall speak
[1:30:33] that's what i want
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:37] knowing that you're a child of god
[1:30:40] you are in your
[1:30:42] line of duty
[1:30:45] oh but christ can do what he
[1:30:48] some people
[1:30:50] want him to do this specific
[1:30:54] they want him to do the healing
[1:30:57] of the body right now
[1:31:00] to give us this gift that gift
[1:31:04] but what if is not what he wants to do
[1:31:06] right now
[1:31:09] i want him
[1:31:11] to do what he wants to do right now in
[1:31:14] me
[1:31:15] i don't want it to stop him
[1:31:18] for nothing
[1:31:21] that's a good desire
[1:31:23] amen
[1:31:27] the church is
[1:31:28] the church of the living
[1:31:30] god so that the way you do the word of
[1:31:33] god accept it in your good heart
[1:31:36] already fertilized
[1:31:39] and all the creepers and the rocky
[1:31:41] places and the stony out taken away and
[1:31:45] in a good rich soil of faith
[1:31:48] believe it commit it to god and walk
[1:31:51] away testifying that you have received
[1:31:54] what god has promised you
[1:31:57] he is the high priest of your confession
[1:32:01] to make right
[1:32:03] anything that you confess that he has
[1:32:05] done
[1:32:06] that the gospel
[1:32:08] now
[1:32:09] the gospel is not only
[1:32:12] inward it is in a power
[1:32:15] you planted that power will be in you
[1:32:20] but we need to start
[1:32:22] by the word
[1:32:23] amen
[1:32:27] now the bible is a different book from
[1:32:29] any other sacred book
[1:32:32] there is no book like the bible
[1:32:34] because
[1:32:36] the bible is god in word form see a word
[1:32:40] is a thought expressed
[1:32:43] god thinking expressed it is word
[1:32:46] through the prophet they wrote the bible
[1:32:49] which is the in
[1:32:51] word form
[1:32:54] and jesus call it a seed
[1:32:57] and any seed will bring forth is its
[1:33:00] kind if it's in the right condition
[1:33:04] the right atmosphere
[1:33:06] don't you just want to have the right
[1:33:09] condition
[1:33:11] right
[1:33:12] atmosphere
[1:33:13] he say that word is the fate expressed
[1:33:16] but if some something can tear away them
[1:33:20] weeds if god by his grace not the
[1:33:23] preacher
[1:33:24] not nobody else
[1:33:26] god by his grace can tear that those
[1:33:30] weeds remove them give the world the
[1:33:33] place
[1:33:34] to
[1:33:34] breathe to grow
[1:33:38] and one one when god need it
[1:33:43] he will reproduce he will do something
[1:33:46] that god wants to do i don't want to
[1:33:48] hold him back
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:53] he's saying talking apply it apply the
[1:33:55] torque and create that atmosphere around
[1:33:58] you
[1:33:59] that they will just drop right into it
[1:34:02] into it see
[1:34:04] you are you are you you uh if you got
[1:34:07] the token you create a spirit
[1:34:10] around you a power
[1:34:12] then when you walk people know that you
[1:34:14] are christian
[1:34:16] they love for you to say something to
[1:34:18] them
[1:34:19] they believe your word
[1:34:21] what you say
[1:34:23] they're all onto it
[1:34:25] they believe your word huh
[1:34:28] is it the word of god or your word
[1:34:31] your word and god's word becomes one
[1:34:36] it did not just happen for elijah
[1:34:39] when he said by my word there will be no
[1:34:42] rain no do
[1:34:43] until i say so amen
[1:34:47] let god say the word is now your word
[1:34:52] amen
[1:34:53] apply that atmosphere
[1:34:56] is that right
[1:34:58] god's words will reproduce
[1:35:02] according to his own kind
[1:35:04] do you believe that
[1:35:06] now we cannot we have been ushered
[1:35:10] into that
[1:35:12] civilization now
[1:35:14] because the fullness of the world is now
[1:35:18] the faith
[1:35:19] of god not my faith people's faith
[1:35:24] but god's faith
[1:35:26] that's why god told brother branham when
[1:35:29] he was criticized that they say oral
[1:35:33] roberts is praying for 50 people you
[1:35:35] just pray for five people
[1:35:37] it looks like verb went into the
[1:35:40] desert to pray why am i like this but
[1:35:44] god said to him these people
[1:35:46] they preach by their understanding of
[1:35:49] the bible
[1:35:53] they
[1:35:54] do what they do by their own faith but
[1:35:57] you it is god sending it to you
[1:36:01] the original
[1:36:02] you want the original
[1:36:04] start with the word
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:08] start with the word apply the atmosphere
[1:36:13] apply the word
[1:36:15] yeah
[1:36:16] plant
[1:36:17] let it receive the water and the light
[1:36:20] that they need the atmosphere it needs
[1:36:22] it's going to reproduce
[1:36:25] that civilization we have just
[1:36:28] ushered into it
[1:36:31] amen because
[1:36:33] before the physical
[1:36:36] before the physical there is a spiritual
[1:36:40] it's always like that
[1:36:44] jesus
[1:36:45] before he goes to calvary
[1:36:48] he wasn't getting money
[1:36:50] you can say calvary was important and
[1:36:53] that's true it was critical it was the
[1:36:56] end of everything
[1:36:58] but
[1:36:59] everything actually
[1:37:02] uh happened it gets money this is where
[1:37:07] he saw the movie of going to calvary he
[1:37:10] saw the rejection there he has to make
[1:37:13] the decision without getting money
[1:37:17] calvary would not have spent happened
[1:37:20] without getting money there will be no
[1:37:23] calvary because this is where
[1:37:26] he had to make a decision to go through
[1:37:30] and when he made the decision he saw
[1:37:33] before he made the decision he saw the
[1:37:36] movie of what will happen if he does not
[1:37:39] go
[1:37:41] how many will be lost if he doesn't go
[1:37:44] he made that decision then get some
[1:37:47] money happen for calvary to happen
[1:37:50] when everything was happening in calvary
[1:37:54] for him it was just
[1:37:56] deja vu all over again
[1:37:59] like you say
[1:38:00] using bad french
[1:38:06] but the
[1:38:07] spiritual
[1:38:10] precede
[1:38:12] the physical
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:15] you cannot go there and have that supper
[1:38:19] without the dressing robe now
[1:38:23] amen and the prophet say god let me
[1:38:27] dress her with the robe now
[1:38:31] that cause for the next civilization it
[1:38:35] happened now
[1:38:36] the spiritual is happening now
