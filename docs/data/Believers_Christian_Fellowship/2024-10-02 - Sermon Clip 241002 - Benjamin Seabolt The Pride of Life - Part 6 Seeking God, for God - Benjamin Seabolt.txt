TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the trouble of it is you're asking people to stand up and accept Christ as my personal testimony stand up like that and that's all they know about it worked up under a little mental enthusiasm the next thing you know it's gone the only way that man will ever stay is for him to lay down there and die out to himself and be reborn again by the spirit of God and filled with the Holy Ghost one way one prescription has it changed since the day of Pentecost don't think that we're going to come to this age and Proclaim and testify we know who Malachi 4 is and we're okay no where's the death to self where's the indwelling of the Holy Spirit where's the real New Birth not pretending I'm afraid we've watered down the holy spirit so much we will take that quote where brother brandom says the holy spirit is just a temporal gift to get you through this life the real gift is that soul in there and I believe that and I say yay and amen but I want to remind you what he said the Holy Spirit was given to you to get you through this life you are not going to get through this life without the Holy Spirit we should seek it it desperately every day of our life unless you don't want to get through this life you think that you have the capability to withstand Le oysa and however million demons were loosed on this age on the Bride of Jesus Christ in your own capacity without the Holy Spirit and say oh well I've got the real gift of Soul inside I don't it's temporal I'll take it or leave it no you're going to find yourself in a house with the padded walls is where you're going to find yourself wrecked up pretending to be a Christian you desperately need the Holy Spirit I desperately need the Holy Spirit every day of my life just to get through life don't water down the spirit of God there was a life that was given for that the life of God was given for that the life of God was given to release that Spirit on me and you just so we could get through this life amen
