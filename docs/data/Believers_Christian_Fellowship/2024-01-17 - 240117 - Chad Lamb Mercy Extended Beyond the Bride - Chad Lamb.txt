========================================

so when we come to the white Throne judgment let's just do it this way let's just say we have a throne Before the Throne there's two sections because he's going to separate them as sheep I want to read this and make sure I get right CU if I draw it wrong I'm going to be in trouble okay the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left so he would be facing them this would be the righteous on his right hand so over here you've got all these people multitudes of people over here you got multitudes of people so when you look at this it looks like you have these that will be eternally lost and then you have the King on the throne and you say well we've got three categories of people but actually according to scripture we have four categories of people because the king is not alone on the throne beside the king is the queen GL amen when Jesus begins to speak here in the parable he says unto them verse 34 then shall the king say that's one person to them on his right hand to the to the righteous come you blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world and we know he speaks to the ones on the left hand those that will be lost and he tells them they didn't take care of him they didn't look after him they didn't serve him so that's we got the ones on the right the ones on the left and the King on the throne but listen to what he says he says I was hungered and he starts to say I was hungered I was naked you clothed me I was was in prison you visited me and they asked uh then they then they asked uh in verse 38 I mean verse 37 then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and thirsty and gave the drink when they didn't even know when they did it they're standing here looking at the king and he's saying you fed me you clothed me you visited me you you served me and they said Lord when they they never saw that figure they never served that figure if you understand what I'm saying they they're confused about how they fed him and how they clothed him and how they visited him but then he makes a statement he and he says and the King shall answer verse 40 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done unto me that's the fourth group that's the mystery group at the white Throne judgment everybody else is is uh uh defined and easily said the one on the right the one on the left and the King on the throne but he reveals a mystery group at the white Throne judgment he says when you have done it to these these my brethren that are sitting here on the throne with me then you did it unto me oh it's always been the mystery group the bride's been the mystery through the whole Bible she's been the mystery group and still in the white Throne judgment she's the mystery group but a prophet is coming and revealed the mystery who this mystery group is it's the bride and she is judging with the King
