their greetings and I also want to send greetings from my parents to all of you brother Bob's sister Joanne deanheart and I I just they send their greetings and a lot of people say how are your folks doing they're doing well for 92 they're doing very well so it's the grace of God and enable them they're still together still living together and and still fixes meals for Dad and so they're doing well I just said the greetings hopefully they can be online this morning they wanted to be so we just appreciate the presence of the Lord and our time that we're here and I pray that the word will be blessed this morning to your soul amen amen I'd like you to turn with me in your bibles if you would and again I appreciate brother Chad inviting me it was a bit of a surprise I said well brother Chad I'll pray about it and they'll definitely led to come in the battle the battle is raged ever since I said yes and so I'm happy to be here through rain and snow and blocked roads and roadblocks and and wind that I couldn't hardly Drive in nobody could and but you know what God gives Grace his grace is sufficient so we're very thankful I'm sure the Lord has something ordained just specifically for you I hope you believe that this morning you didn't come here in vain you couldn't even come here on your own you know that I didn't come here on my own it was divine grace that brought us together once again so we're thankful for the word that comes from here and I'm thankful for the presence of the Lord is so wonderful to walk in this presence to know that you're in this presence daily what a joyous relationship what a union it's not a public show is it it's an individual affair praise be to God in the book of First John just read a scripture to hear and have you be seated first John 1 or first excuse me first John 5. and I'd like to read the fourth verse just to start here this morning let's read first verse with it whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God not was is present tense the Christ the anointed one the anointed word among us is born of God no man can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Spirit did you know that except a man be taught of God he can't know the presence personally of God himself amen then the fourth verse for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you may be seated faith is a revelation the prophet referring to Hebrews 1 11 1 he said faith is a revelation the scripture said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen faith is a revelation amen amen it's an actual substance it's something you know it's not something you imagined it's not something that is a myth it's something revealed to you that's as real as you see anything else or your senses would declarally it's it's another sense it's the Sixth Sense and it's faith amen and it is the evidence that what has promised you that you may not see yet in vision of your vision but yet you know you have it amen and it must come to pass amen then I'd like you to turn with me to Psalm 62. 2 Psalm 62 remember our Victory is our faith psalm 62. foreign with verse 1 truly my soul wadeth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved notice here he's saying David's saying he only God himself not another person God himself he only is my rock let's go down here to the fifth verse my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense [Music] I shall not be moved you were just set out brother sister you bride you are planted you were predestinated by God through foreknowledge for knowledge he knew you amen he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Sila and I want to jump down to the 11th verse God has spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God I want to take this for a title our positive position our victory our positive position our victory and we're speaking on a subject of Bride material bride material is actual substance material means the substance in which a thing is made bride material or bride substance this bride material is the substance the revelation of God himself this bride substance this revelation of himself this little bride is himself revealed brother Branham said on the message Shalom two of them both in Phoenix and both in Watch Fort Huachuca Arizona he said notice David here speaking of The Rock he said Rock in the Bible means revelation and David is declaring God is my revelation Jesus said that I'll build my church upon the revelation of myself who I am he said I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and Revelation faith is substance of the thing that God promised you you have the very substance of it because before and remember this and let's go I want to turn over here to Matthew very familiar scripture but you don't have to turn if you want I but I just Matthew 24 35 very familiar and it should be familiar back in 24 35 it said now I got to get to 24th verse not 20. okay it said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away what is the thought it's a word a thought has to be expressed a word excuse me what is a word it's a thought expressed what is the word what is God's word is this thought it had to be a thought first it had to be a thought first and that thought expressed is his word and Jesus is saying here heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away so it had to First be substance it had to be God's thought and God's thought what he thought wasn't a whim it wasn't imagination it was actual substance it was Faith even the prophet said that God created the worlds by faith he first had to think it he had it in his mind and then he expressed what he had in his mind and he created is that right by faith he said the scripture said in Hebrews 11 3 that by faith the worlds were created that things which are were not things made of which we see it was a spoken word it was a spoken thought amen and the revelation of the word is the thought behind that word it becomes substance to you and I that word becomes substance all right of the thing promised so you have the very substance of it all right so we we look at this and so we have the substance now man as I said and brother Branham said after quoting that scripture in Hebrew and excuse me in Matthew 24 35 he said and if you you any you here this morning and that not only speaks of a lamb female lamb but it also is you all right you if you be that word he said you will not pass away either so where were you before it become a word he said if you be that word then you had to be the thought first Hallelujah stimulation is coming on now you had to be the thought first all right so I want to bring the word substance in the Greek if you look at that scripture faith is the substance of things hope for the word substance means that which has actual existence amen that which has actual existence you have the substance of something you have you have what the word promised you you have that in existence that's why by faith you can walk forward by faith we live by faith by revelation amen or late I want to break into this there's a lot of things to go with here so you bear with me we're talking about bride material brother Branham made this statement over here in the scripture and I've got other scriptures to read here but he said in a in a message in perfect faith Jesus lived in a world that no one note about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect Faith now perfect faith is God's faith it's not an intellectual faith it's God's faith amen that's God's revelation that's why the scripture said David said he is my rock brother Brown I'm referring to that said David is saying that God is his revelation David's saying God is my revelation I can hide in that I'm hidden in God I'm I'm found in him he is my revelation he is then my substance Hallelujah he is my substance all right and so he goes on to say he lived an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the in the perfect God in which he was he lived in a perfect faith of a Christian now you know what a Christian is not not the word Christian not nominal Christian means tabernacling very deity himself Christ like you can't be christ-like without Christ being in you you cannot be Christ's material God's material until God comes and lives in you so so we see here brother Branham also said that bride material he said it's the substance of God made word and expressed in what you are now it's the substance of God made word what is that substance it's thought made word and expressed in what you are now the substance of God would be the thought of God if you ever were a part of God you always were a part of God I'm going to come to this so I want to get ahead of myself here but I want to show you God wants to show you and establish who you are your positive position the prophet said in the in the message things that are to be he said oh God it's so good to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ it's so good to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ you then are his revelation it's not another person it's the same Christ brother Branham called with the same Jesus in The Bride form and there lays our victory is that revelation it's the same word it's the same power power belongeth unto God so it's not another Power it's the same power it's the same word a word has to be a thought before it's a word so it's the same thought Hallelujah not another just a moment here I'm wanting to locate oh yes I'm wanting to find here oh there there it is right in front of me okay Satan likes to hide things once in a while but God how many know that let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God that form means in morphe who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God all right and he said but let's let that mind be in you all right so he said so so what's that going to take what's that going to take to have that mind in you it's going to take a predestinated foreknowledge and that becomes in you amen it's God materializing himself in fact he said when he thought let me just drop this in into you here a little bit he said I have some notes I'm carrying over from other messages so if I look like I'm turning quite a little bit I am see God in the it's the same thing as moving a computer you know up and down I'm not I'm the old school so you need to really listen you're going to have to use one sense more than the other one and that's your ears you're hearing all right see God in the beginning when he thought of you and I'm going to just drop this in I'm going to God this is my this is my whole subject but watch this God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself being tangible that was his thoughts see that was his thoughts what were those thoughts substance we're going to show this by what he said here in just a moment remember thought substance is something of that has actual existence it's real and he said he said he thought of you thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible that was his thoughts see so he expressed his thoughts by word and he said let there be Let There Be and there was and then after a while the people said one day don't let God speak he said I'll I'll he said I'll speak to them through then through I'll speak to them then through a prophet and the prophet will say Let There Be and there was Hallelujah are you hearing all right so he said here he said God and morphe mask in a pillar of fire god amorphy in a man called Jesus stretching his tent same God taking on a mask God amorphe in his church amen God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person Hallelujah that's why I say I'm blood related to you not natural blood a deeper a lot deeper than that more real than natural is that's temporal but this eternal blood which had eternal life in it amen are you with me I'm talking about spiritual that blood that dropped on the ground soaked in the ground but that blood had life that was not the blood of a of of a Joseph it was the blood of God you're not saved by the blood of a man you're saved by the blood of God the prophet said amen all right so he said now it's God with us the same person this bride thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ and the prophet said she's the body of Christ then she's the Revelation she is the revelation of himself and he said it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source came from the same source Eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member Jesus our lord that's our head how many know that our head Jesus Christ even our Lord why in manifests in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride amen all right let's go to a scripture here let's take Ephesians just a moment Ephesians chapter 1. foreign familiar scripture again but you know the scriptures are read over and over again and one day it all of a sudden becomes substance I may know what I'm talking about it's right there it's real I never saw that before and yet I read it intellectually believed it till it dropped from here to here you truly hear with your heart amen Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as you see in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him now before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will wasn't your will it's his will it's his achievement it's his doing it was his thought is that right all right said now verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will his word the mystery of his word the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself he purposed it he purposed it in himself so before you existed he knew you he knew you before the world began he knew you that's why you can know him yeah because he knew you I can know him because he loved me I can love him but he had to love me first is that right for me to know I love him means that he loved me first and because and if I know him then he had to know me first he said that in Saint John 14 he said I know my sheep and am known of them amen is that right he said they know me because I know them Hallelujah all right now I want to go here and and share some things with you he said on the church age book before I do that how many believe that by what we're what we're going to just cover here is something that is shows you that as a Christian you always were you are identified with him what is our identification his life revealed in you himself revealed in you is the token amen token is his life and it identifies you it identifies that you always were in him you always were a part of him amen all right before we do that I want you to go to Jeremiah 29. 11. I may know we're in the bright age amen amen we turn the corner Hallelujah this is what he said about that let me just share this with you and that's what the Bible has been now he said it's the same God all the time changing form in morphe he said now it's God we know he spoke this now it's God and bride form he said so the and what is it what would it be the bride coming of Christ all right now he says and that's what the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its Sevenfold mystery opening of Seven Seals it's Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the at the age of this laodicean church he would take the mask off of the whole thing and we could see it whose we could see it only the bride only in her he uncovered himself what'd he uncover himself in you but what he uncovered himself for so you could find and see himself in you so he could come in the union with you he had to unveil himself amen he unveiled he said the whole he said the whole uh the the promise he said and God promised notice this God promised in this day what is Faith the substance of things promised amen he said and God promised in this day at the age of the laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it and what a glorious thing amen what a glorious View now to lay in his presence Union coming in uni pouring himself into her he said they are becoming one for the wedding supper amen all right so he taken the mask off of that and and in this hour unveiled the mystery where is the mystery to be unveiled the mystery was in the pyramid the mystery is in you amen the mystery was laying in you is still a hidden Mystery but when God unveiled himself you came face to face with him I want to read that in just a minute found in second Corinthians chapter 4. amen because this is what it is we now have this treasure in Earthen vessels not another person God himself God is my revelation amen God is your Revelation bride your position your identity lays in nothing else your identity is in him all right verse 11 of Jeremiah 29 for I know the thoughts for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of Peace you notice that's an individual that isn't a group I know the thoughts that I think toward you he's speaking to Israel yes as a nation but he's speaking to other bride here amen the prophet said he said the word the word that spoke of the group speaks of the Bride the same word the word that spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace that shalom thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen now he comes down here in in the church AIDS book and this is Page 163 paragraph 163 and I'm I'm referring how many know that that there's a there's a the the older Church age book and then there's one that brother George had put out you know about that this number I'm giving you is the one that brother George had had put out that it's the same wording it's just a little bigger font and you understand different page number and it and and so on page 163 number 163 says now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself all right and in Romans 9 11 it said that purpose of God that that the purpose of God according to election might stand what is election First Peter 1 2 said he elected by foreknowledge speaking to the elect he said by foreknowledge so he had a foreknowledge of you amen all right you were his thoughts and you had to be expressed I'm getting ahead of myself let me back up you can read it no other way you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the heart purpose the Eternal purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing this is the heart purpose this is the climb this is the purpose of God through the whole scripture we find a mystery of God that was still sealed up but couldn't be unveiled until this age the mystery of God the seventh Angel's message which prophet said is the seventh seal which is the Revelation 10 message he said that he said that would unveil the and finish the mystery of God amen I hope you can come to yourself and realize you always were substance existing all right so now we come down here and he said he said here he says now he goes on he said it was purpose that purpose was in himself the heart purpose was the purpose in himself of being and being Eternal was decreed and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world it was hard to decree God cannot change his mind Hallelujah he may permit you to do something but that doesn't change his mind and God's mind concerning you can't change all right so he said here he goes on to say watch carefully paragraph 164 page 164 he said watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of worship of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind I'm speaking to you hello bride was already in his mind the bride was already in his mind yes she was watch this existing she was existing in his thoughts what's the substance something of actual existence amen she was already existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God Hold Up Wait A Minute back up here who are the thoughts of who are the thoughts of of God there's only one form of eternal life that's God himself creator of heavens and earth the author of life and The Giver of every good gift God Alone is eternal life and he had his bride in him as the thoughts of himself he said here is what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not amen they are Eternal are they not he said the Eternal thoughts of God the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore as he as God is omniscient he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge and he's not omniscient the best we could say that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything Hallelujah he doesn't have a new thought about you amen what what was expressed in his word you were being expressed Christ was being expressed all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was is now poured in where poured in injected in it's a marriage brother sister it's a union all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was is poured in what is Christ it's the mystery of God revealed so Christ in you would be what the mystery of God revealed only the prophet said it would be the complete revelation amen what he thought about you he had hidden in himself he hid it in the word now we look in the word since he's unveiled himself and said oh there he is there she is there he is there she is why that's me amen this is me and this is what's this is what's coming to such a maturity what is it here's what the prophet said about it he said if Jesus lived in a world that no one knew about I started that quote and I didn't finish it if we he said he in the perfect faith in the perfect God of which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what's the Bible say walk in the spirit and you'll not fulfill the lusts of the flesh is that right if you therefore walk in the spirit then if you live in the spirit also walk in the spirit there's your identity there's your Abiding Place there's Who You Are amen praise the Lord if we would walk in the in a perfect faith brother Brown said perfect Faith he said the exact quote he said perfect Faith he said is substance faith he said perfect Faith does not is not a intellectual Faith he said it's not a human faith it is God's faith and he said it's substance perfect faith is a substance faith for faith is a revelation the Revelation is a substance and the Revelation is the evidence and the revelation of the word in you is the evidence that you always were a part of him [Music] because it takes that it takes that word as in seed form that God planted in you he already planted it because he already decreed it and if he decreed it it become word and if it become word and now planted in you then he then the bride is the only one that could be reborn because in her is something that the Holy Ghost would come to himself himself coming to himself weren't coming two word that would Quicken that in you and what would it be it would be himself unveiled all right then where did you come from you were the actual existence you were his thought you were existing in his thought amen you talk about overwhelming when you realize that you realize you realize this word is my absolute this word is the ultimate I came from it I'm a part of it no wonder I can do nothing else but obey it I can do nothing else but no that's my absolute that's the amen that's the letting off of all pressure I don't care how bad it gets I was his thought expressed now in the being that I am I'm God's material amen I'm God I don't say that boastfully I say that by Grace I didn't have a thing to do with that God unveiled it himself it's God's achievement bride it's God's achievement you are in your position and positionally placed because it's God's achievement Prophet said I've come for one purpose he said I've come here to forerun that coming word I've come here to forerun it he said he's not coming for Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostals he's coming for the bride Jesus Christ that's a direct quote I've got it right here in front of me let me say it again he said he's coming for the bride how many believe he's coming [Music] that's not what I was that's an I am to a body change we have is coming I know that's beat down and broken down and everything because people don't understand it because it's only made known to her that's the mystery of our message that's the secret you're the secret unveiled it wasn't unveiled out here in the public it's unveiled in you Hallelujah amen so he's coming he said he's coming I'll say this real slow he's coming for the bride Jesus Christ that's who he's coming for now you say well Brother David you I'm not making Brother David Jesus Christ but this unveiled word in me is who I am while you make yourself God to people brother Brown to people he says well that's enough star far off the truth is it brother he said why he said in one side a.m the others he said he was just on the wrong side trying to find him he's out on the other side of the flesh but this man inside man we're talking about is this unveiled word and his name is Jesus Christ and that's my name I'm married to him this Union is taking us to a body change brother sister this Union this Union we're not we're we're not looking at another we're looking at himself in Bride form you were his thought you were here expressing he was expressing it decreed you he already became Christ you realize he's already become Christ and Christ is now in you the mystery of God revealed is in you you're the final mystery makes you brother rap said the Christ and you makes you the full Revelation the complete Revelation the finished revelation of the whole thing [Music] Hallelujah I never say another word here that's amen and go home that's the truth because that's the whole message the bride grows up into the form of what she was meant to grow up into himself comes right up into the into the headstone himself perfected in him himself we've received a message of maturity we're laying in the presence of that message we are that message we are Eternal I just said we're existing in eternal life those thoughts of God is Who We Are amen this is Who We Are those thoughts of God are eternal he just said are not the thoughts of God Eternal and you were existing in the very thoughts of God and they are eternal amen then I am not this this is expressed through this walking in you living in you living through you Brian let a bride get a hold of that she won't try to be puffed up about nothing she realizes what she possesses did Jesus walk puffed up let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who made himself of no reputation he just expressed who he was he knew what he was he knew he was that word what about you do you know you're that word amen you were expressed in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelled Among Us amen you'll never come to that theophany body you bypass it you know you came directly from the thought Hallelujah you came directly from the thought of God and God's revealing his sought to you and showed you who you were so he could take you back to what you bypass and then pick up from there you pick up a glorified body amen is that right Jesus went to hell he came back and picked up the body and came forth glorified amen are you with me if this body'd be Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting Jesus didn't bypass that he came directly he was Melchizedek before he became flesh is that right he was the theophany he knew all things we bypassed that and came directly from the thought but this is what's taken us back to where we were amen and he's redeeming what is God redeeming he is redeeming his thoughts his thoughts are redeemable thoughts that's what he died for when he died on Calvary you were there with him you died with him you were in him then he never divided he never separated you went to him you went with him to Calvary Hallelujah you Rose with him you died with him you Rose with him amen how many is raised with him now seated in Heavenly places oh but brother I made so many mistakes you think God pays any attention to that if you have that desire in your heart to do it you need Calvary you have no desire to do that God's not judging you by your outward anymore by your flesh he's judging you by the what he sees through the blood you're judgment you've already taken judgment in him there's no condemnation to the bride she's not going to be at the white Throne being judged she's going to be judging the by the word amen where is God today he's in Bride form where is he where is Jesus Christ he's in the bride form amen not another person himself and what is that for for the meeting in the air we've got to come to that Revelation or the manifestation of we've got to come to that substance that substance has got to be real in you the rapture's got to become substance in you everything we have need of in this journey is already given to us it's already provided for us God will reveal it when we have need of it but everything we need is already there even including the rapture hallelujah it's already in you working taking you to a body change we already see it as substance we come to that substance there's no question I'm there I'm already there I was already in God's thoughts to be there I'm not yelling at you it can't be anything different than I am though I may Roar a little loud but my middle name means lion-like Leon I guess if he Roars the roar isn't going to hurt you amen Hallelujah I'm gonna talk real sweet and you know some yell but I don't care about that as long as I know him and if I know him I love him and if I love him I have to love you I will love you and I do love you amen I'm just so glad that he can unveil where I was to begin with that says if I know where I come from then I know where I'm going if I know where I come from I know who I am that's right job said where were you where were you when I when I on when when I the sons of God shouted for joy where were you job where were you stand up like Amanda answer me where were you my Lord where were you you were in my thought shouting for joy you were there you actually existed there now watch what the prophet goes on to say he goes on to say this what did I do with my handkerchief all right he is omniscient he can never change have a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts has always been has he has always had and always will have he knows the end from the beginning because he said thus the because excuse me because he is God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real what's real the things we look at and see are the things that are unseen if what we if we look at the things which are seen they're what temporal if we look at the things our focus is on the Unseen what is the Unseen it's greater than the scene because the Unseen is eternal that's real and brother Brown used the term who's the real you the real you is the spirit of God in you things that are to be 1965 he said the real you is the spirit of God in you amen this is an old coat you wear but the real you is the Inside Man that's the real that's what you focus on where's my headship in me where's my guide in me amen I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you I'm getting into another message all right then his thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they exist they are not simply like a man with a blueprint has drawn up in which one day will have translated into substance and form they are already real they are already substance they are already real and eternal and part of God amen Psalm 139 declares this my substance verse 15 my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth my substance was not hid from thee Thine Eyes did see my substance what is that substance we're not talking about a natural failing substance we're talking about an eternal spiritual substance a spiritual thought manifested in word which is what God's seed amen and God quickened that seed amen expressed it come down here and Prophet said let there be let there be and you were birthed under that word why you always were that word God's thoughts were expressed amen the message is God's thoughts expressed concerning you makes you the message makes you the message you're the message you're the message living you are the word living the prophet said the bride would be the word living and in action in other words she's the word she's living and operative Hebrews 4 12 the word is sharper than any two-edges sword living that's a Greek translation but Greek is living and operative a discerner amen amen all right so he said he said he said this is then brother Brandon before he was reading that Psalms 139 he said God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed as his thoughts were yet unexpressed and so he goes to Psalm 139 he read the scripture I just read to you Thine Eyes did see my substance yet unperfect and in thy book were all my members written see your name was already already written already decreed in the book of eternal life is you know that that book of eternal life is a section of the Book of Life and it's the bride section how many's read that in the church age book that bride section it's a section of that book amen many names on The Book of Life but there's a bride record there's a bride section there's an eternal life record whose names could never be removed from that because they are the names of his bride and he said he put those names on the book of life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I'm redeemed amen that's right he redeemed his thoughts did you know that his thoughts are the Christian of today his thoughts are the Christian of today I don't have time to read all this I'm just quoting it to you his thoughts are the Christian of today any Christians here this is pretty stimulating I'm not asking you to shout and dance but it's stimulating it'll stimulate the interaction it'll put the word in your grip when that word's revealed to you and you I'll let me get I'll get that in just a moment so he said if you would walk in the spirit what this if you he said the world wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then then the people began to say why you'd they'll think you're a Mystic person to them that's the way it is with all believers so cheer up cheer up that's the way it is with all believers why are you trying to live or stand by what somebody else thinks about you either this has become substance in your life or it isn't and if it isn't keep keep reading keep drawing don't run from his presence run into it keep feeding on the open book keep feeding on on where you're recorded what God said about you and let God reveal his substance of his thoughts to you amen there's no reason we're not out here to make a show we're up here for doing one thing our Lord is our head we're here to serve him so let me wait at his door in prayer let me let me just wait let me wait at this at his feet in humility Let Me Wait at his table in service Let Me Wait at his window with expectation they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mound up with wings of eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen I say again I'm going to come to this later on not this morning but shalom how can anything be unwell with you it's well you say I don't feel like it's well I'm not talking about your feelings I'm talking about substance I'm not talking about what you see and what you feel and what you sense I know those things are real we all go through that and we're doing that for a purpose because God knows how to bring this character out of himself it's all working for your good did you ever catch the Revelation I'd say God Brides catching that Revelation that she always was in the mind of God always was his thoughts and his thoughts are being expressed today so we hold this treasure second Corinthians 4 7 we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of God may not be of us it's not the power of David amen it's not of us it's of him we have this treasure in Earthen vessels praise the Lord praise the Lord this is the very thing that's transforming this is the transformation this is the transforming power amen is himself and you unveiling himself you're growing up into his stature the stature of himself amen you have to grow up into him amen all right now so he said that is the way with all believers they're Mystic the people don't understand because they because the Believers live in a world to themselves God is my revelation so it's between you and God amen it's between you and God is the word it's between you and that word it's you and word together uniting together amen it's not a group it's an individual have holding this revelation they walk in the spirit live in the spirit I don't care what's going on around them they can be upside down I'm not saying you have you have tosses and you have turns you have pain you have struggles what's that got to do with what I'm talking about this morning amen we'll get to that maybe Wednesday but this is what we're at now it's the substance revealed in you to take you through those struggles and trials and everything it's taking you through it bringing you in through it out of it I came through all kinds of struggles to get here Satan doesn't want you to know what God thinks about you because what he thinks about you and put in the word is your absolute it's your ultimate amen and he knows as long as you stay behind that word there's not one thing he can do with you oh he'll try but he can't do it heavens and earth will pass away but my word and if you be that word my word shall never pass away you're that thought behind that word he put it in Word amen that's why you've got to feed on it that's why you've got to stay in it that's why you've got to you've got to continue to feed upon it take time redeem the time don't you get so busy to miss the rapture take time with God amen you've got to take time ask God to reveal it to you when things don't go just right put God before you amen all right so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith brother Branham I'm quoting here I mean substance face he he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ what is that new creature a spoken word creation let's turn to Second Corinthians just a minute second Corinthians chapter four and let's look at this new creation see what God did here the Bible said here in chapter 3 that when when your heart was turned to the Lord the veil was taken away that's the 15th verse of chapter 3. no I'm 16th of her excuse me I'll just read it nevertheless when the shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face that open means unveiled face whose face is unveiled if the veil is removed whose face do you see now the Lord is that Spirit now we all with open face beholding as in a glass it's a mirror beholding is in a glass the glory of the Lord brother Bradham said who is the glory of the Lord It's Jesus Christ but you're looking in the mirror and you with all with open face are not looking in that mirror and you're seeing the glory of the Lord and Prophet said then who are you seeing he said you're seeing yourself he said beholding is the glass the glory of the Lord are changed see a Rapture has already begun our change into the same image from glory to glory from Revelation to revelation even as by the spirit who's doing it the spirit of the Lord then the fourth verse said seeing we have this ministry what Ministry the ministry of the unveiling of himself the ministry of the unveiled Christ seeing we have this ministry the unveiling of who we are seeing we have this ministry seeing we have this message amen he said as we have received Mercy we faint not then it goes down here and if our gospel is his hid to them that are lost and then who blinds him as a God of this world then it comes down here to the fifth verse for we preach not ourselves but Christ The Mystery of God revealed we preach Christ the lord see what is the mystery it's Christ in you what's the mystery revealed it's Christ in you what is the Glorious Riches of this mystery among the Gentiles is Christ in you right then we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants vessels for Jesus sake for God now this is what I get into here it is watch for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined where in our hearts has shined in our hearts to give what is he doing there he said he said in Isaiah 60 thy light is come is that right arise Shine for thy light thy light hello is there any lies here you for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you I preached I think that one more other time he'll not share that Glory with another he'll not share his glory with another but bride you're not another you are him the Bible over and over again father may they have my glory may they receive my glory may they have my glory may my glory be upon them Jesus said that in Saint John 17. you're looking into the mirror seeing his glory who is it you that's another message but that's the message that is the message you are his thought amen revealed unveiled you always were his thought he had no other thought about you his thought about you was the revelation of himself when he thought about you he thought about being material he became material he wanted to become material oh my the devil's distorted everywhere we turned didn't he he can't resist this because when this is in you it's a substance and you've got a word to come back is that I've got your answer Satan I've got your answer you're howling so loud because I have your answer this bride has your answer your or her answer is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that's her answer it's not her living anymore it's not me living anymore it's him living in me not my life it's his life The Head and the body brother Brown said have become one unit amen hallelujah amen amen means so be it amen now so he spoke of Adam there being he said my substance yet being unperfect in my in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned as yet there was none of them so brother Brown said this he said that was not written about Adam without him name there but it gives you the idea knowledge that he that the thought that was in his there in his mind and that thought was eternal and it had to be expressed amen can you see yourself eternal that's who you are that's who you are you come down here you bypass your theophany to come down here in this flesh man to be tried and tested God wanted to become known so he used tests and trials and struggles and to make himself to unveil himself through a law of contrast amen here I am inside of me eternal life here I am the outside warring against me my enemy but who's going to win who's I should say who has won the Eternal thought of God expressed in a word and revealed in me has already won expressed in you amen has already won the battle it's already finished the battle's the Lord's amen amen all right so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now just let me finish that scripture for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the glow light to give the light thy light has come what's the light shining upon to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God amen what am I looking at here I'm looking at a new birth amen I'm looking at a birth word he said he comes in and what's that do it just continues to grow it grows into maturity it grows into the stature of what it is what's your stature Christ is your stature what's your identification Christ is your identification amen who are you Christ is who you are amen amen amen Satan does not want the bride and she's got to receive this it's got to be manifest because that's her that is who she is and when you know who you are then you have an expected end Hallelujah when you know where you came from know who you are you know I mean know where you came from you know who you are and if you know where you came from and who you are then you know where you're going it's already promised it's yours it's already given to you a position is something you've been put in place you didn't put yourself there he put yourself there he put himself there he puts himself as yourself amen now I'm not going to get anywhere near but I'm just waiting to see Lord how much of this to bring but I want the main subject to come out you are his thoughts you are the very substance that he's spoken to existence when that Revelation comes in you you know one thing you have a body waiting for you amen you know you've got to come to a glorified condition he said those that he called he foreknew he called and those that he called he's already glorified is that right already already well God surely will change his mind by all the things I've done that's wrong did you want to do those things have you ever met him have you met him have you met face to face with Jesus Christ in you which is that sixth verse watch this he said he said to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ or in the person listen to know him as life is that right to know him brother Brian said not to know his Bible not to know his letter but to know him we're not Ministers of the letter we're Ministers of the spirit we're Ministers of the thought that's behind that letter amen that's what God's unveiled that's never Satan never been able to grip that thought see he knows that word is God's word but he's not a part of that thought Hallelujah I'm talking about his eternal thought of himself God expressed it in the word the prophet brought it out the Seven Seals unveiled and took the veils the seals off of your life he unsealed your life that's what the seals were all about to show the bride who she was in the beginning what she would be here at the end and who she was all along that's what the seals were all about amen and when he unveils himself he comes into private he comes into Union with you nobody else sees that unveiling nobody else should see that unveiling it's only made known to her not a public show not known to the public you say well what's public everybody but bride I I don't know who bride is I'm not saying you are you aren't I'm just saying everybody but bride is public this can't be known to the public the only one going in the Rapture going into body change a meeting in the air is going to be the bride not only of this age of other ages but the whole thing without us it can't be made perfect we have the perfect interpretation of the word by Divine vindication you can't add to what that Prophet said you can't take away don't put your opinion on it amen it's not your opinion a man your opinion doesn't stand it's it's his opinion he already thought what he thought of you just grip a hold of what he thought and walk in that spirit because we have the Bible said the 13th verse of that same chapter I'm reading here second Corinthians 4 said we have we having the same Spirit of faith therefore speak it just and I'm bypassing some of that because I want to bring that up in another message but but we've gone through this we go through that we go through this we go through that but having the same Spirit of faith so we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal you're not identified by your temporal you're not identified by your mistakes you're not identified you are identified in Christ from the found before the foundation of the world you are identified already in God as his substance you are the very Revelation and substance of God yourself glory to God talk about a peace talk about arrest anybody entered into that rest then you've ceased from your own labors amen Hallelujah if you're cease and you are the word now made manifest living and operative oh brother Branham said if a bride could just get her positive position and know her stand in this hour and know that this message was for running her the coming word it was it was the forerunning of Jesus Christ in Bride form what is this what is this bride form what is it the bride coming what is the what is this coming out of dark denominationalism it's Christ in Bride form or the bride coming of Christ that is the revelation that's why the bride sees it that's why the bride recognizes it she's the only one that can see that mystery of his coming you say well Brother David you're sure being no I'm not I'm being exactly what I should be to the word bride this is exactly the message she gets you say they're very few well very few that believe that I don't care how few it is I know that substance in me if I be the only one he said that makes it if you were living here I lived in Lime again I'd be the only one making alignment be me why because I hold that substance that's more real to me than I'm standing here on this platform that's real because that's real that's real because it's eternal you say do you walk in that every day every day well don't you have trials and struggles to test that has nothing to do with my trials struggles and tests I've overcome every one of those already what is it because I'm walking in him I'm putting him before me if I put him before me don't you make a mistake sure I make mistakes but what's that got to do with my relationship with God what's that got to do with the revelation of this substance what's that got to do with the revelation of where I came from that doesn't change it glory to God that does not change it you can't pull me out of a relationship with him when I was ordained in Union with him when I was already his thoughts expressed when I was already in his mind are you going to take me away from the relationship with him when I always was related I always was married I was married to him the old man is dead out of existence eternally separated I've been eternally separated that old man is dead eternally separated I come back to what I was in the beginning amen amen and now it's expressing the being that I am Glory I say Glory do you hear me glory to God says in a myth you know him you know who brother Bram said it's not it's to know him is to know the person Christ himself is to know him to know him is to know the person Christ himself is when you know him I wish I could figure this out quit trying to figure it out call upon God let go of yourself die to yourself let this give yourself in total abandonment to him well I don't know what might happen if I do that let go of yourself let go of your reasoning let go of it let God govern your being govern your thoughts govern your actions let God have control and be had over your senses bring every thought under obedience to Christ where's Christ he's my guide yes he's your guide he's in you trust him he's revealed in you trust him and you will if he's unveiled in you you'll trust him he'll teach you to trust him the Bible said he'll instruct you and teach you in the way you should go amen amen amen my praise the Lord so if we walked in substance Faith you excuse me a minute if we walked in substance faith then your entire isolated and you become a new creature in Christ now watch what he says there now you're getting into bride material there now you're getting into Rapture condition hello bride do you realize what's happening we're coming into Rapture condition amen we're coming into Rapture condition this is what he's doing this is why you go through the things you go through because God's teaching you to trust him teaching you to rely upon him showing you and you've been more you rely upon him the more he's unveiled to you ever notice that you've ever experienced that you give yourself over to him the more is unveiled to you the more Revelation is coming to you amen just keep resting just keep yielding keep yielding Lord you are my substance you are my joy you are my peace you're my refuge you are my rock I have no other identity you are my revelation boy quite an identification Brother David are you trying to say your royalty I sure am and so are you bride we're the queen of the king amen what a position and he said I'm going to bring you to your position I will bring you to your place I'll bring you to that amen praise the Lord these elect what are these elect brother Brown said they're the Eternal thoughts of God which are to be expressed in flesh in their due seasons this is your season this is your season and he said they are to be expressed these thoughts these he said these elect are the Eternal thoughts of God these elect is there any elect here these elect are they not will be they are they are let me say it again they are the Eternal thoughts of God Express we can say today expressed in this new season the veil has been removed the Bill's been taken off the lid's been taken off and we're ready for a body change we're maturing we've matured we're growing we've been growing I've been growing for many years I'm still growing what am I going to grow into a changed body I've got what is going to change me I've already got it amen amen so he said therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed you see it's a promise isn't it it's a promise of God and you have the substance of that promise you've already got it it's revealed to you already have it there's no doubt about it you have it you have the very evidence of your body change you have the very evidence of what God said you were and who you are you have the very evidence you have the revelation of it now you say well Brother David it's not revealed to me I'm not saying it will or I won't I'm saying just keep feeding what's the desire what's the draw in your heart what's drawing you shows you what kind of filter you're going to draw through amen the desire of your soul is going to determine what filter you'll use if you're Desiring more of God and that desire's there he's provided a filter to take you in a body change because you can't draw anything through that filter but life eternal life and when you draw that eternal life it's going to Quicken that seed that's inside of you and that seed has got to come to full manifestation of his word God's got to fulfill it amen praise the Lord all right now you're getting into bride material so it's by faith so that the promise might be sure what is Faith the substance of things the substance of the promise you have the promise substance faith is a revelation of the will of God you have the revelation of the will now God showed you his will and what he thinks about you what he's determined about you now why don't we just walk on in the light amen thy light has come then lay in the presence of the light amen this is the message God is light and in him is no Darkness at all is that right and they that are in the light are not in darkness there's no shadow of turning with him isn't that a wonderful absolute no shadow of turning can't fail those thoughts of himself which are yourself Can't Fail they can't come to an end they can't fail God's thoughts won't fail they can't fail they've got to be fulfilled they've got to be expressed and when they're expressing the word the word which you are must be fulfilled now I've got to close let me just try to come to that place those that are royal seed are the elect of God are predestinated are for known you know it's enough to tell you right now that he he knew you that ought to be enough if you have the Revelation that he knew you that ought to be enough you say well he knows everything but I'm not talking about what he knows about everything I'm talking about his thoughts eternally the Eternal thoughts of himself he knew you he knows he knew you well brother if I know him how many know him okay then he had to know you first how are you going to get out of him when you're in him who's going to take you out of him who's going to say you're imperfect when you're perfect how who's going to say you how can the count who can accuse me of sin when I'm sinless Oh Brother David now we know you've gone off the deep end we know you have I'm not talking about this man I'm talking about the Eternal thought of God amen I'm talking about who I am Who You Are we're growing into that stature that's why all I can talk about is that how can I talk about anything else why would I talk about well this guy in this flesh and this mistake and this one and that one and the and every why discuss those kind of things I mean we discuss it but why why talk about my failures when I can talk about the positive position that I hold well you're just not living in reality no I am in reality you're the one out of reality well you're odd but it takes oddballs you know it takes a nut to hold the bolt we it takes a nut to bring the two together too amen that's right now you're getting into Rapture condition in plain language these elect are the Royal seed they elect they are the elect of God they were for known of God and were in the mind of God and in his thoughts if I never get any more of that you're going to know where you came from at least you're going to have a mental conception and say God I've got to have this reveal this to me I've heard this for years we've read that for years and all of a sudden now it's more than just reading now it becomes real now become substance what does the faith come by a hearing of the word what have I got to preach my own mind my own thinking no I'm going to preach what he said it's not just reading quotes anybody can read quotes anybody can take their knowledge and put quotes together I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the revelation of what's being said and if that same spirit's in you now watch what he said here watch what he said here before a word say he's referring to Saint John 1 before a word it's a thought and remember I started out with that now watch he said and the thought has to be created leave me alone I feel pretty good he said a thought has to be created all right so God's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that's me Lord mama that's me the Bible said in that day you shall know Saint John 14 20 and that day you shall know that my father me and I and you and you and me and brother Bram said when this day comes along you'll know that he said and then you'll know it's he and you and you and him or him you and him and he and you is that right then you know who you are then he said in Saint John 15 7 if you abide in me and my word abides in you when were you when were you abiding I just got done talking you were existing you were existing in him you were birthed because you always were a part of him and when the word which expressed you came on the scene it quickened you the spirit coming through that word quickened you it was sent to Quicken that seed that's why only the bride only the elect can be reborn because in non-elect there's nothing to Quicken then if you've been quickened rise shine which having poochie lip disease rise up I'm not asking to be a show out here I'm just saying live what he said let it live through you let it live through you he said I'm going to work and live and work through the bride my word is working through you that's what you're here for that's what you're in the Earth for so it's a thought it had to be created when it spoke by a word it becomes creation then watch what he said then when it's then when he presents it to you as a thought when he presents it to you as a thought he reveals it and it's revealed to you he presents it to you of a thought and he said his thoughts and it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it that's why the prophet said up there in the mountain when that storm he said it was God that said you say to it it was God that revealed his thought to that prophet and it was still a thought until he said to the storm is that right it was still a thought when he said he said now you stand up he said whatever you say about meaty it'll be that way is that right and he couldn't he what what gave him that opportunity that's why he had always confused me how can I say as a man Mountain be removed how can I say it but it was it was his vocal cords but who was saying it it was that thought revealed inside of him it was God speaking to him it comes by Revelation the prophet said you wait on Revelation not just be all you think yours inspired but wait until it's revealed then speak and go forward that's all you have to do amen you're speaking his thought it's revealed to you that's why the just shall live by faith amen there you are Hallelujah all right I can tell you quote after quote how he said you wait for Revelation you wait on the Revelation and when it's revealed to you then go forward then you have thus saith the Lord amen who has it today she has it why because the word is opening the word is revealed the seals have been taken off your life and now God's obligated to his word to fulfill the word by revealing himself to you personally and realize who you are and he and the bride are no longer Twain he said she's United with the head what's he doing prophesying out they're no longer Twain now they're one the word message has gone out he said they're no longer Twain They Are One and we grow into that and we realize hey I'm one with him I know I'm no longer Twain now I'm one with him what God has joined together let no man put asunder and that man happens to be the very one you're sending in that's right did you catch that amen amen amen all right so what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you faith is the revelation of the will of God so by revelation amen amen so by revelation now we're coming to a conclusion in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body where's God's place of worship in the body where'd God put his name in the body and unless you're in the body you can't even worship Him that was strong wasn't it but that's what he said you've got to be in God's provided place of worship and how you're going to get there by birth what's the birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon that seed amen Hallelujah then you come face to face with something now you've come face to face with himself you've received the knowledge of the glory of God in the face or in the person of Jesus Christ that's to know him don't come short of that you're young people you say I've given my heart to the Lord I've been baptized that's good but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I don't say that just to young people I say that to old people too and I can say that because I'm one of you I'm not a young man anymore I don't know how much longer I've got to go but there's one thing I do know I have a glorified body waiting I may have to meet my theophany first but I'll sure rise again and come back to a glorified one he has to complete his thought of you Hallelujah I feel pretty good I don't go on feelings but this revelation tells me I don't care what I face I'm going to come to that Lord willing I don't care what we face it is Shalom amen it's a gift to God to believe you know let me just finish this up he said so we in turn now come conclusion Jesus dwelt in the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was with the father manifested in flesh excuse me that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn what was he he was the firstborn among the creation of God who are you the creation of God expressing himself through flesh how would he do that he elected you he foreknew you you were his thoughts and when those thoughts are revealed in you you realize who you are you're the very expression of God the very creation spoken word creation of God amen all right so he said he said in our turn we became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are of God excuse me in manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore were Reborn as I said for only to let him be reborn if you are true seed you will hear that word you say well Brother David everybody's hearing it's not talking about this hearing it's got to come through here into here it's you here here you have an ear to hear or other words receive you can receive the word for your season you can see your position in the season if you see your position I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say spoken word thought expressed I'm one of them My Confession all right now who was Jesus he was the word manifested thought who are you the word manifested thought now you bypass the Opera you know that I don't have time to read that whole quote but who is this Melchizedek Jesus was in that word form body you didn't come in that word form body in other words this body is not the word amen are you with me the words in me bringing this body under obedience to it is that right Romans 8 11 if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ hello he that raised up Christ in you shall also Quicken your mortal body hello the Lord's brother bam said now he'll bring it subject to the word and if you pass from the scene he'll raise it again is that right it's not Resurrection is not replacement if I go in the grave this man not this sin not this not this old decrepit body but this body will rise again but what how will it raise sin can't raise Darkness can't raise death can't raise it's conquered amen but I raise up in a glorified body but it won't be in Jesus that went in the grave came out wasn't another person it was him the same body that they saw Gwen came out only now it's glorified walk through the room went in met him stood in their midst the doors locked is that right but feel me I'm flesh all right that's won't go any further than that you know what I'm talking about all right now even job said I know that in my flesh so the skin worms destroy it yet in my flesh I'll see God and I'll Stand upon the Earth with him someday see I'll meet him here I met him here I met him in the way here he is speaking to me where I come from and who I am and it dawned on job why this is why I came through all I came through brother Graham said he wanted to show job who he was see God has a purpose he has it lined out for you exactly you just need to trust him to take care of it and quit trying to rely upon your senses and your reasoning you know the devil's a Master with reasoning you know that go listen to word go listen to go listen to wisdom versus faith and see what the prophet says about his reasoning and what faith is all right I'm gonna I'm really trying to close honestly all right let's see now this day this bride today has got to be the word the word she's got to be the word this day since this day she's got to be of Christ she must she's a part of the bridegroom so she's got to be the word the word not for his day but she's the word for this day what he promised would be this day amen who's going to receive the substance of that see what he promised to re to would be this day he sent his word forth to mold the bride hello are you being molded to mold so don't look at all these things happen to you look at the negative look at the positive praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm going to worship Him Anyway praise the Lord give him thanks in all things for it's the will of God concerning you well that can't be the will of God's concerning it is the will of God concerning you so thank him for it go on put the word before you do as David did put the whole word always before you he's on my right hand I can't be moved hello bride how many believe you can't be moved he said God is my Revelation is that right God Is My Rock I shall not be moved amen amen all right so he said here he said his four his word to mold the bride and make her he said now I hope we see it don't get some idea your own don't take somebody else's idea take the Vindicated word here what the Bible says now in this day now remember let me just drop this in let me drop this in the Virgin this bride will not be put in the hands of denomination it sure won't be yet sure won't he said excuse me it won't be put in the hands but if it's put in the hands of denomination it sure won't be a virgin it'll be manhandled time you get to it but God's church is not touched by denomination hallelujah it's a virgin born word of God made manifest remember before a word of thought it's a virgin-born word of God made manifest comma Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah my how wonderful I love it I believe it I know it's the truth there will be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride amen all right she's got to be the word not for his day she must be the word for this day she is the word for this day that he promised would be in this day he sent his word to Mulder amen all right now now in this day I can tell you where this found this is found in this day this scripture is fulfilled paragraph 151 if you want me to give you all that information but in this day there is to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be it would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it will be a spiritual seed there is to be there's to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham of Abraham's royal son she's the Royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and a place and the time and place is a promise that's given to her now when that's revealed to you you have the substance of the promise is given to you amen all right now he said so therefore we know this we know this foreign that now we see seeing that that's to come on the scene in the last days now we know now we see excuse me I'm trying to find the quote so I can just read it to you now we see now we see paragraph 578 Christ the mystery now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride brother sister now we see it brother Brown said now we're going to now we see it now we see the Promise being fulfilled the promise being fulfilled what God promised in his word what's the message doing speaking Let It Be who's he speaking it to he's commanding it is that right I will speak through my Prophets now we see the Promise being fulfilled the true headship going in going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling the word as he did in the first of Saint John 14 12 he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and if he's alive in you who's doing the works all right you're going to have my father worketh hitherto and I work I can do nothing until my father shows me brother Bram said that same harmonist exists between the bride and the groom it's Revelation I can't do nothing until he shows me amen is that right and you have your position you've got your position in the bride then let God rule that position he's your head you think it's going to miss his position you don't have to copy after somebody else you're a member in particular and a particular member means it's been personalized to you and brother Brown said he's personalizing himself to us he's pouring out himself into US amen and he's being personalized before us and you in here one right now so the head and body are becoming one in works and inside and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days his promise this in the last days now if you're spiritual you will catch it who's spiritual he that has the spirit of God working in him dwelling in him that's the spiritual that's the spiritual one that makes you spiritual oh he's just too spiritual thank the Lord amen then we see the marriage supper is at hand if I never see you again he said then we see the marriage supper is at hand in other words it's very close very present amen is coming into manifestation it's going to come it's got to come we're in a feast now what will it be in this Union Lord brother sister look at look at we show he's had relationship with us because the blood is showing I don't have to go any further than that do I what's the blood showing the token you've come in Union the veil's been broke when the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil's taken away and now all we with open face are beholding into the glass the glory of the Lord are being changed changed changed I'm walking with God I'm being changed the token is being I'm holding that token I have I have the identification I have the assurance amen I'm there I'm already there and God's mind I've already been put there in God's mind I'm already his manifestation of himself this is who I am all right let's finish this I've got a lot more but I'm going to close all right now the part of the of that's Eternal of God cannot die amen that part that's Eternal part our body parts die but there's a part that doesn't die and that's Eternal amen we know that God's thoughts God's thoughts it was his thoughts that was in him always there God's thoughts is as Eternal as God is that ain't skim melt brother here it comes God's thoughts was his word he thoughts is what he was his thoughts is what he was and then the prophet said that you too and he said let this mind be in you so as you think in your heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Psalm 23 7 as a man thinketh in his heart so is he God's thoughts was his word and that was and that was with him and in him God's thoughts were expressed in a human body amen if your heart can believe it then express it if your heart can believe it look what he said let me just close on a couple more things here and that's it look what he said here let me read this he says I can do nothing of myself remember the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride the same word as the thoughts expressed of the groom is the thoughts expressed of the Bride I can do nothing in myself he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word he was the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was amen and brother Brown said when the bride knows what she is it'll take the rapture when she knows what she is walks by that substance Faith what is it the right material it's Rapture condition all right now he said he understood his position he knowed what he was because this is what the scripture said he was therefore he lied upon God who made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what God made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe had he had faith in what he was if you're a Believer have faith in what you are you are a believer in other words you are you hold the substance you are a Believer you have faith amen all right he said now the only thing you have to do is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are it's written of me amen amen he knew that he was he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah don't you know you're the anointed Messiahs of this age that's what the prophet said he what you were amen It's A Love Affair between the spirit and the bride the spirits being poured out upon her amen the Messiah of the age having the same spirit the anoint what is a messiah the anointed word you're not another person you are him in another form amen amen all right but I but I'm not all of him I'm a measure of him you're a major of him you're a measure of me I'm a measure of you we each have our position a many member bribe but every member is Christ amen every member it can't be something else amen now I'm getting to something here he knew that that with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him and he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God same thing with the bride and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a believer there's your identification you are an identified believer is that right didn't didn't Abraham didn't his faith have to be identified he was given the seal a sign of circumcision amen which identified him God recognized his faith to be God's his own faith God's faith what's our sign of circumcision it's a holy spirit circumcision amen the token he said and and does not it identify you in him all right I've gotta okay and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer see now watch what he says and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you and a Believer is this is perfect Faith paragraph 68 if you want to look it up he said and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you the faith of what whose Faith God's own faith the faith the substance of God that moves in you that's the real believer amen all right all right let's just close this off look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer I just love it he said that is the body of Christ what was once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it he said oh my he said but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ now your threefold your threefold mystery of the seventh seal or the threefold purpose here second fold now watch first fold what God was in God's mind is he said been unfolded in Jesus Christ the mystery Eternal God has a mystery then it was given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church the bride Whispering secrets to her amen amen he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost being personalized before you he said oh he said Hallelujah he said I'm so glad he's personifying himself right Among Us not a bunch of dancing jumping singing and I'm not against that if you want to dance as high as you live that's fine yeah or shout or jump but by his word he's making himself known amen amen you can see the evidence of whether he's in you or not can't you it's not the emotion it's the word living it's your ability to receive and hear the word amen it's God's ability amen Hallelujah now a position a position is a place where someone is located or has been put positive position he said it's a position where someone is located or has been put God put that in you amen before the world began put someone in a particular are you listening First Corinthians 12 27 you are members in particular it puts someone in a particular place amen amen God thought of you knew who you were knew you would be here amen praise be to God now things that are to be and I'm going to close right here look Christ in you I know I mentioned this but as we're speaking again Christ look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation he said see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ amen listen but now Christ which was a complete Revelation the Bible complete revelation of him now Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do he said see what God's trying to do that's why I said now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride he said you that are spiritual you'll catch it amen amen nobody's nobody's boasting of anything we're all boasting her for any boasting it's boasting on him he's the center of it he's the one that's achieved it it's just being revealed that's all and I'm enjoying it and he put it and gave it to me that I might be blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ I know he chose me in himself where was I his thought expressed in the word and there I was expressed now how's the word going to pass away Hallelujah see your light has come now five five minutes maybe less I only get one opportunity well no I do have two opportunity hey you're my family you ought to know how I preach no I I've been here quite a while all right now if we are those attributes thoughts of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism I don't care denominationalism that's out there I'm talking about the denominationalism that comes around and said we're in the message we don't live by that not at all we won't give a it's like I forget that messenger not Martin but uh anyway one of them was militant against any form of denominationalism amen any form militant against it and we are too it's not an organization it's not denominational spirit it's Christ's brother sister it's Christ we see Christ we've met him when you meet him face to face you come to yourself now we must live by the word because the bride's a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husbands therefore we must live by by that word and what is that word bride listen now carefully on these last quotes I know you're tired you're ready to go eat listen to me carefully and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or
