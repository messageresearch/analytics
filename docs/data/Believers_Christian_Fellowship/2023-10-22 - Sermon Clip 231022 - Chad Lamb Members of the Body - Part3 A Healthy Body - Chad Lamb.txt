TRANSCRIPT
========================================
anytime something will get you to leave the ABCs amen you know it's wrong amen something that will get you to leave Fellowship it's wrong because we're not to forsake the assembling together of ourselves amen even the more so as that day approaches that's a commandment and brother Benham said amen that commandment drives us into church we should have a heart to get to church every time the doors open and if our heart's not there he said we need to get to praying but when all of the sudden our heart turns from there and we don't want to be in the fellowship that doesn't mean that God won't move You from One Church to the other God has the Liberty to move his sheep wherever that's not what we're talking about but when we start laying out of church and not connecting and becoming disconnected I if I would search that out I would say there's a complex there somewhere and somebody's believed a lie somebody has received and accepted a lie and they're disbelieving something I had a sister come to me one time and she was so troubled about something that was happening in the church many years ago and she says this happened and this brother came from this church to this church and that influenced this and and you decided to do that and you did that because of what that brother did in other church and the whole thing was a complete fabrication complete 100% there wasn't a threat of Truth in it at all but she saw things and connected them and what happened was she had a complex from a previous Church she was at she had an overbearing Pastor who took control and the whole church fell apart now she's afraid and so she's on the lookout anytime she saw something that she didn't understand then all of a sudden all of a sudden she worked up a whole scenario that was not true what's he looking for an Open Door a bruised cell a weakness amen the minute that that we can get pulled off the word the minute that we can think it's all right to gossip there's a complex driving that somewhere the minute I can speak evil or critical of another brother without going to that brother and talking to them just talk to other brothers there's something driving me to that cuz that's not the word the minute I can lay out a church and not go and be comfortable just bailing out and not going anywhere there's something wrong something's driving that you say what is driving that because the word says don't forsake this sibling together that's the word now there's something in me that doesn't want me to come to the word what's driving that is it an old pain from childhood is it because of something somebody said is it a rejection pain is it a hurt what it what is causing me to want to pull back from the body what is causing me Amen to want to speak evil to somebody what is going on Amen that I am going down this path I think we need to stop and say what is pushing me me because this isn't the word that's not the word amen we may not be able to figure out what our complex is we may not be able to figure out what happened to us as a childhood but we can certainly figure out the moment we step off the very ABC's basics of the word go to church pay your tith love the Brethren speak nice things about one another no gossip no backbiting I mean those are the simplest when we move off of that we need to say wait a minute something's going on here amen amen something's pushing me out from around the word and you know what it's never just about me the devil's trying to destroy the body bring in through a Bruce cell another life and through that other life spread say God please help us
