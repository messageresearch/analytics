[0:00] man wants to put his effort towards
[0:02] something but every time man puts his
[0:04] effort towards something he ruins it
[0:06] amen
[0:07] and it's god it doesn't want us to put
[0:09] our effort towards something he wants us
[0:11] to surrender to something and it was his
[0:14] will now don't don't get me wrong it's
[0:16] not like we don't have any effort we do
[0:19] the word of god we sacrifice we give up
[0:22] we we obey we do what he called us to do
[0:25] but at the end of the day what can you
[0:27] do amen what what work are you able to
[0:30] work what thing
[0:32] what can you do what power do you have
[0:35] what will your little hands and your
[0:37] little body what will it do they meant
[0:40] nothing but surrender to the will of god
[0:42] it's the will of god that'll bring the
[0:44] victory
[0:48] remember jesus is our example
[0:51] he goes to win the battle
[0:54] he goes to bring victory he goes to
[0:56] release us from bondage he goes to to
[0:59] break the power of the enemy by
[1:01] hybridization he goes to shed his
[1:04] precious blood amen as a perfect slain
[1:07] lamb to free us from the curse
[1:11] and there's nothing he can do
[1:15] there's nothing he can add to it
[1:18] there's no effort he can put into it
[1:21] he just has to completely surrender
[1:24] and let god do what god already ordained
[1:27] that god would do
[1:30] he wouldn't even speak at his trial
[1:34] you think of the wisdom of solomon but
[1:36] he said a greater than solomon is here
[1:38] the wisest of the wisest was standing
[1:40] there on trial amen and the trial was a
[1:44] dog and pony show and it was an absolute
[1:46] ridiculous trial and do you think that
[1:49] jesus with a few phrases couldn't have
[1:50] unraveled the whole thing he couldn't
[1:52] have made pilate ashamed of himself he
[1:55] couldn't have made canvases in the high
[1:56] priest tucked their tails and those who
[1:58] were speaking against him run away and
[1:59] hide with just a few phrases he could
[2:02] have discerned the whole thing he had
[2:03] more wisdom than solomon had amen a
[2:06] greater than solomon was standing on
[2:08] trial amen and it wasn't his wisdom that
[2:10] was going to win the day it wasn't words
[2:13] it wasn't discernment it wasn't anything
[2:15] that was going to win the victory he had
[2:17] to close his mouth and completely
[2:19] surrender and let god do it amen this
[2:22] was god's victory man this was god's
[2:24] doing amen but god couldn't do it
[2:26] without a human being god has so set his
[2:29] plan that he doesn't do anything without
[2:31] you and i he needs a man to work through
[2:33] amen but he didn't need this man to do
[2:36] anything he needed this man to say thy
[2:39] will be done not mine
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] that's the kind of man he needed for the
[2:44] greatest victory amen for the for the
[2:46] destruction of satan for the overcoming
[2:49] amen of the fall he needed a man that
[2:52] wouldn't put his own effort into it amen
[2:54] when he wouldn't use his own mind that
[2:56] wouldn't even use his gifts
[3:02] for the greatest victory
[3:04] he needed a man that will stand
[3:08] and be quiet
[3:10] and surrender
[3:12] and let god have his way
