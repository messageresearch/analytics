TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus looks at Peter and says Peter Satan has desired to Sifty like wheat he didn't say I prayed through the father so that you can bypass that trial no Peter needed to be sifted like wheat because Peter had way too much self-confidence way too much pride he was way too arrogant and he felt like he could do something and he displayed how self-confident he was when he drew his sword and tried to kill the servant of the high priest he was showing how proud and arrogant and how self-sufficient that he was amen and Jesus didn't say Satan has desired that's asking permission Satan has desire to Sifty like we he didn't tell him no he said go ahead but I've prayed for you that your faith failed not Peter needed to be sifted he needed to be humbled he needed to run out and weep on his face and cry and repent what do we need we need the same thing we need to be knocked off of our high horse like Paul was knocked off of his high horse we need to be smoked we need to be afflicted why because there's too much pride in the human race there's too much self-sufficiency too much arrogancy amen every time we start feeling like we got our act together we can figure this out we know what to do God will stick his foot out and trip you so you fall and bust your nose come up with a bloody nose and you realize I can't even walk unless he leads you and that busted nose is the best thing that ever happened to you or I oh my goodness this is hard this is real ain't Mr real people in a real world and it's really going to overcome by the grace of God by predestination not by human effort not by human willpower not by our brains and our will and all I I am so tired of an arrogant attitude in me I'm so tired of fighting with pride all the time I'm so sick of it amen I say God help me help me Lord to stay humble to stay nothing so that you can be something Peter goes from I'll never forsake you oh men oh men leave you alone I mean what's he saying is he showing his love for God no he's showing his arrogance he his pride in himself it looked religious it looked like love it was self-love on display to finally God has a broken man that will humble himself and that it will repent before Gone when he has a repentant broken man then he can fill that man with the Holy Ghost and he can take him out to the gate called beautiful and he can speak in the name of Jesus Christ and that man can go leaping and running and and then all can gather around and they begin they begin to praise uh they can begin to praise Peter and Peter will say why look you upon us as though we in our strength have healed this man we haven't done anything but in the name of Jesus Christ who you crucified this man as him it's not us it's Christ oh what did Peter need Peter needed to be sifted like wheat Peter needed to fall Peter needed to repent what do we need we need everything God has ordained for us so that we can come to perfection
