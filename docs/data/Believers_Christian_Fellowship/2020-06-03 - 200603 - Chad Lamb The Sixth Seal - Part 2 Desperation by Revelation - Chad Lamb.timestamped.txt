[5:20] to be going up to michigan and preaching
[5:23] for brother dan ratliff this sunday so
[5:25] he'll be away this sunday in michigan
[5:27] preaching
[5:27] so i'm sure he'll appreciate your
[5:29] prayers and i
[5:31] just got word that just shortly ago
[5:34] brother ron and sister becky garvin had
[5:36] their baby girl
[5:38] so praise the lord that she was induced
[5:41] this morning
[5:42] earlier today at least and they have a
[5:44] healthy
[5:45] baby girl we don't know any details so
[5:48] you have to come back sunday
[5:49] for more details the problem is you guys
[5:52] all have social media so you'll probably
[5:53] find out before sunday
[5:54] but i'll announce it again on sunday
[5:57] amen but we're happy for them
[5:59] and keep them in prayer amen let's look
[6:02] at revelation
[6:02] chapter 1 verse 1 again
[6:07] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:09] gave unto him
[6:10] to show unto his servants things which
[6:12] must shortly come to pass
[6:14] and he sent signified it by his angel
[6:16] unto his servant john
[6:18] who bear record of the word of god under
[6:20] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[6:22] things that he saw
[6:24] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:26] hear the words of this prophecy
[6:28] and keep those things which are written
[6:30] therein for the time is at hand
[6:33] man that's wonderful isn't it the time
[6:34] is at hand blessed is he that readeth
[6:37] and they that hear the words of this
[6:39] prophecy
[6:40] and jesus says you cannot hear my words
[6:44] so it's more than just hearing amen
[6:47] it's hearing with understanding amen you
[6:50] can be seated
[6:53] i'm going to continue on some things
[6:56] that i didn't finish in the
[6:58] sixth seal so this will be part two of
[6:59] the sixth seal but it's just a little
[7:01] bit different from me god i was up here
[7:03] praying at the altar just a little bit
[7:05] ago
[7:05] about six o'clock and all of a sudden
[7:07] god shuffled everything
[7:09] for me and so i was in the back jotting
[7:10] down notes feverishly so
[7:12] i don't have i may not have all my
[7:14] quotes together
[7:15] i don't even have my act together but
[7:17] praise god we want god to have
[7:19] god has his act together that's for sure
[7:22] so just pull and just bear with me as i
[7:24] stumble around and try to share
[7:25] what god has laid on my heart to share
[7:28] i'm going to do just a little
[7:30] review and go through a couple quotes
[7:31] from last time and then move forward
[7:33] brother branham says in the sixth seal
[7:35] said for
[7:37] we know that the six seals is the the
[7:39] sixth seal is the judgment seal
[7:41] it's the judgment seal exactly what it
[7:43] is now notice for the sixth seal is the
[7:45] judgment seal
[7:46] of the word amen so we can find this
[7:49] sixth seal it's the six seals the
[7:51] judgment seal of the word
[7:52] word so we can find it all through the
[7:54] word amen god is bringing judgment
[7:57] under this sixth seal all through the
[7:59] word
[8:00] he says in handwriting on the wall but
[8:03] but now while we're speaking on this it
[8:06] came on my heart that this would be a
[8:08] very unusual but a timely message for
[8:09] the people
[8:10] now any bible reader here knows that all
[8:12] scripture has a compound meaning
[8:15] every prophecy some most all of it has a
[8:17] duel
[8:18] a time there or two times or more that
[8:20] it will be answered as a revolving
[8:22] history
[8:23] we've read that many times but it's
[8:24] important to know because if we can
[8:26] catch that concept we don't get stumbled
[8:28] up
[8:29] amen when we when you see it's fulfilled
[8:31] here and it's fulfilled there and it's
[8:33] fulfilled here
[8:34] and this applies and this applies and
[8:36] this applies
[8:37] and this is what stumbled theologians
[8:39] for years and they've divided into
[8:41] separate camps
[8:42] and depending on which university you
[8:44] went to to get your doctorate
[8:45] degree is the way you would interpret
[8:47] certain prophecies being fulfilled and
[8:49] would not allow for any other
[8:51] fulfillment
[8:52] and then we'd miss much of the word amen
[8:55] because it's not intellectually
[8:56] uh received it's received by revelation
[8:59] amen and god gives the revelation on the
[9:01] word
[9:02] and the revelation i would say this way
[9:05] the revelation
[9:06] oh i'm going to say something that might
[9:08] get me in trouble but you
[9:10] understand me the revelation is fluid
[9:12] not rigid
[9:14] [Applause]
[9:15] revelation in the word is fluid not
[9:17] rigid and i don't mean that in that
[9:20] you can misinterpret the word what i
[9:22] mean is
[9:23] a man would want man wants safety and
[9:26] security
[9:27] and he wants to use the word to build a
[9:30] wall to hide behind
[9:31] to be safe and secure but that's not why
[9:34] god sent his word
[9:35] god did not send his word and i know the
[9:38] word is a wall
[9:39] i'm not i'm not i'm not changing any of
[9:41] that i'm talking about what man does
[9:42] with the word and what man wants
[9:44] man wants a word where he can say one
[9:47] plus one
[9:48] equals two every time 1 plus 1 is 2
[9:52] and this and this but god absolutely
[9:54] will break our understanding and he'll
[9:56] use the word
[9:57] in different ways and in different times
[10:00] and man wants it to be
[10:01] simple and logical amen and predictable
[10:05] so that he can feel comfortable and an
[10:08] intellectual understanding of the words
[10:12] but that's not what god gave of the word
[10:15] for
[10:15] god gave his word to reveal himself to
[10:19] us
[10:20] and the revelation of him is a strong
[10:24] tower
[10:25] because the lord is a strong tower that
[10:27] the righteous into that's the wall that
[10:28] we hide behind
[10:30] not an intellectual understanding
[10:32] because somebody said
[10:33] this scripture means that it always
[10:35] means that stamped
[10:37] sealed approved amen but this scripture
[10:39] can mean
[10:40] this and it could mean something else in
[10:42] another application
[10:43] and something else in another
[10:44] application amen and if we depend on
[10:47] intellectual understanding
[10:48] we get nervous with the way that the
[10:51] flex
[10:51] the flexibility and the and and the
[10:54] fluidness
[10:55] of the scripture make us nervous
[10:58] but with revelation once you see the
[11:00] seventh seal
[11:02] it doesn't matter anymore once you see
[11:05] the seventh seal
[11:06] your security is not an intellectual
[11:09] understanding of the word
[11:10] your security isn't knowing the word
[11:12] himself because that's the seventh seal
[11:15] that's the one you've met and now you
[11:17] can see him in this verse and in this
[11:19] verse and in this verse
[11:20] and now i see the seventh seal in other
[11:23] places than revelations 8 1
[11:25] because if you go looking for him in
[11:26] revelations 8 1 you won't find anything
[11:29] because revelations 8 1 where he's
[11:31] supposed to be
[11:32] he's hiding behind the silence
[11:38] do you understand what i'm saying i hope
[11:40] you understand what i'm saying
[11:42] we we what man has done to the word
[11:46] amen we human beings try to do to the
[11:48] message
[11:50] try to to we try to hem it in
[11:55] we try to trim the edges we try to make
[11:58] it predictable
[11:59] amen so that we can use these scriptures
[12:01] as building blocks you know
[12:03] and we can build predictably our own
[12:05] walls and our own
[12:06] our own doctrines and our own
[12:08] understandings and all we're trying
[12:10] to do is create a security and it's a
[12:12] false
[12:13] sense of security this is the reason
[12:16] there's such doctrinal debates because
[12:19] the doctrinal debates come from
[12:22] insecurity
[12:24] because i you know if i've created my
[12:27] doctrine to make me feel secure
[12:29] like i'm bride and i'm safe and
[12:32] everything's fine with me because of my
[12:33] understanding on these few points or
[12:35] whatever it is
[12:36] then if you challenge that i must
[12:39] destroy your challenge because this is
[12:42] my security
[12:44] does that make sense now do you
[12:46] understand why there's so much fighting
[12:49] because now i have to absolutely destroy
[12:53] your viewpoint because my security is
[12:56] coming from my
[12:57] doctrinal understanding and my security
[13:00] did not come from contact with the
[13:02] seventh seal himself
[13:04] because if i've made contact with the
[13:05] seventh seal himself even if my
[13:07] understanding of the scripture is wrong
[13:10] he'll correct my understanding of the
[13:12] scripture
[13:12] because i'm united with him the seventh
[13:15] seal which is the mystery of the whole
[13:17] book
[13:19] he'll right every wrong he'll fix every
[13:21] wrong
[13:22] so there's no reason to argue and fight
[13:24] amen if somebody sees it differently
[13:26] that's okay
[13:27] i mean that's fine because i don't need
[13:29] you to see like i see to make me feel
[13:31] good about the way i see
[13:33] because i've been into the little room
[13:35] and i've seen him and i've met the
[13:36] seventh seal
[13:37] and everything is fine it's all okay
[13:41] well what does this scripture mean i
[13:42] don't know what a brother a man in being
[13:43] by that i don't know
[13:45] but i am united with a husband who knows
[13:47] it all
[13:48] he is the word and he will reveal to me
[13:50] the word that i need as i need it
[13:54] praise be to god so this whole idea
[13:57] of the flexibility of the word i don't
[14:00] mean that
[14:01] to take the word loosely and do whatever
[14:03] we want with it
[14:04] but i mean to take it and let god do
[14:07] whatever he wants to do with it
[14:09] because there's so many times that you
[14:11] find people who are trying to correct
[14:14] the prophet of god
[14:15] in his misuse of the scriptures
[14:21] and the prophet of god didn't misuse the
[14:22] scriptures
[14:24] he just didn't use it according to an
[14:26] intellectual understanding
[14:29] he caught a revelation and that
[14:31] revelation allowed him to see the
[14:32] mystery
[14:33] in every type and in every character and
[14:36] all through the bible
[14:38] and because of that oh we're getting
[14:40] into good stuff friends
[14:42] because he saw the mystery in the whole
[14:44] bible
[14:46] and he could identify the mystery amen
[14:49] in noah the mystery and abraham and
[14:51] sarah
[14:52] the mystery here in the mystery there he
[14:54] no longer needed to quote the bible
[14:57] verbatim
[14:58] to preach because now he can quote it
[15:01] i mean i i don't want to say cruel wrong
[15:03] but he can rephrase
[15:06] the words in the bible and say it
[15:08] according to the
[15:09] application that he's applying this
[15:11] scripture to and he's
[15:13] absolutely correct
[15:17] but if we get the old denominational
[15:19] rule around we'll be like that's not
[15:21] exactly what he said
[15:22] what exactly he said was this word in
[15:24] this word in that word the prophet knows
[15:26] what he's talking about he knows the way
[15:27] he's using the scripture
[15:28] amen so we've got to allow for god to do
[15:31] what he wants with his own word
[15:34] and if he wants to take these two
[15:35] scriptures that don't have anything to
[15:36] do with one another and put them
[15:38] together
[15:38] and say they go together then praise god
[15:40] they go together
[15:43] how i don't know but they go together
[15:48] you see we've got to allow the word to
[15:51] lead
[15:51] us instead of us leading the word
[15:55] and we've got to allow for the word
[16:00] we have to allow the word to paint the
[16:04] picture
[16:05] that god once painted and used the
[16:08] scriptures that he wants to paint the
[16:10] picture
[16:11] even if he wanted to paint the picture
[16:14] differently before with the same
[16:16] scriptures
[16:19] you understand because he's gone
[16:23] it's his word and his objective in his
[16:25] word
[16:26] was to reveal himself to his bride
[16:29] to his people and that's the goal that's
[16:32] the purpose
[16:34] amen now
[16:38] brother graham goes on to say in this
[16:40] day the scripture is fulfilled from 65.
[16:43] he said in history has many times
[16:45] repeats itself history does
[16:46] and so does the promises of the bible
[16:49] for instance like matthew 3 where he
[16:51] said out of egypt i've called my son
[16:52] now if you run the reference on that it
[16:54] was jacob his son he called out of egypt
[16:57] that was his lesser son but his great
[16:59] son jesus was called out of egypt too
[17:01] so it had a compound answer
[17:05] it goes down that same same uh
[17:08] same message further down he says in
[17:11] history
[17:12] always repeats itself probably said
[17:15] always
[17:15] history always repeats itself and
[17:17] scripture has a compound meaning to it
[17:20] and a compound revelation so praise be
[17:24] to god
[17:25] we love that so now
[17:28] we were looking at the scripture last
[17:30] time
[17:31] in matthew 24 when brother branham goes
[17:33] through the six seals and
[17:35] he goes down through the five the five
[17:36] seals and then
[17:38] then he skips over to to verse 29 in
[17:41] matthew 24 and talks about after the
[17:43] tribulation of those days
[17:44] and points back to the holocaust and the
[17:46] tribulation the jews went through
[17:48] and shows the sequence of events but the
[17:50] other places goes back and he picks
[17:52] up the the application of the sixth seal
[17:55] in between
[17:56] amen to the jews that were judged in a.d
[17:58] 70 when titus came
[18:00] in and and sieged laid siege to
[18:03] jerusalem and totally destroyed him
[18:05] and and the reason i want to look at
[18:07] that for just a minute as i want to
[18:08] remind you of something that we read and
[18:10] then i want to move on from there
[18:12] it says now in questions and answers
[18:15] from 1964
[18:18] he says and according to the history
[18:20] there wasn't
[18:21] one of them that believed in jesus and
[18:23] believed the word but
[18:24] what was watching for that to happen
[18:27] titus
[18:28] coming in you know they may not have
[18:30] known it was titus but they knew
[18:32] something was coming he may not have had
[18:35] the name and they may not have had the
[18:36] date
[18:37] but by god's mercy and grace he sent his
[18:40] elect a prophet
[18:41] and that prophet gave him the word and
[18:43] when they saw the word coming to pass
[18:45] they knew to flee he said not one was
[18:49] caught
[18:50] and they escaped and went to jerusalem
[18:53] and to judea
[18:54] and fled for their lives not one of them
[18:55] because they were worn by their shepherd
[18:57] and was watching for that hour to come
[18:59] when they heard titus was coming they
[19:01] took off run for their lives and got out
[19:03] of the city
[19:05] and we looked at that because we typed
[19:07] it with the old church with the
[19:08] denominational system because titus was
[19:10] going to trap them behind the walls of
[19:12] their own church
[19:14] and that's exactly what's happening
[19:16] today through the ecumenical movement
[19:18] amen the rome the spirit of rome titus
[19:21] represented rome he was a roman general
[19:23] amen and then the the rome is trying to
[19:26] trap the world behind the walls of their
[19:29] own religion
[19:31] including the jews including the muslims
[19:34] including every other religion
[19:36] they're trying to pull them together and
[19:38] let you remain
[19:40] what you want to be and that was kind of
[19:42] a a benchmark that was something unusual
[19:45] in rome amen most uh if we could put it
[19:48] this way
[19:49] uh many times in in history when there
[19:52] was a dominating nation that nation
[19:54] would dominate
[19:55] another country and convert them to a
[19:57] new religion
[19:58] but rome was unusual and rome would let
[20:01] you still
[20:02] keep your religion
[20:05] that's just history and so
[20:08] that spirit has not died rome will not
[20:11] let you
[20:12] keep your religion but come under their
[20:16] rulership
[20:18] that's the same thing that vatican do is
[20:20] accomplishing letting you remain a
[20:22] presbyterian and a baptist
[20:24] and a pentecostal but coming under the
[20:26] headship amen and the pope will be the
[20:28] head of all even though they didn't
[20:30] intend for it to be that way
[20:32] rome's pulling the strings
[20:35] so much so that i i read an article uh
[20:38] several years ago this has come to my
[20:40] mind in indonesia the indonesian
[20:43] government
[20:44] which is predominantly muslim they're
[20:46] like 80
[20:47] muslim the indonesian government was was
[20:50] doing a new census and they passed the
[20:52] law that everybody had to declare a
[20:54] religion
[20:55] they wanted they wanted everybody
[20:56] registered they wanted everybody to
[20:58] declare a religion on their senses
[21:00] and they've got some indians that live
[21:02] back in
[21:04] in the jungles and those indians back in
[21:06] the jungles
[21:07] i think at that time they didn't even
[21:08] have a written language
[21:11] and they didn't have a formal religion
[21:13] and there was only a few choices i don't
[21:14] remember the choices i don't remember
[21:15] all the circumstances
[21:17] but they had ancestry worship they
[21:19] worshiped their dead ancestors
[21:22] and they didn't have a formal religion
[21:23] didn't have a name for religion they
[21:25] were just
[21:26] they were just bush people but they the
[21:28] government was
[21:29] forcing them to pick a religion so when
[21:32] it came down to it
[21:33] they picked the catholic church because
[21:35] the catholic church
[21:37] let them keep their ancestor worship and
[21:40] in the article i read they
[21:41] interviewed the catholic priest that was
[21:44] in charge of this area
[21:45] and the catholic priest he didn't make
[21:47] no bones about it he didn't whitewash it
[21:49] he says no because we believe in in
[21:53] intercession of saints there is no
[21:55] conflict between the catholic church and
[21:56] their religion
[21:57] and we allowed them to maintain their
[21:59] worship of their ancestors
[22:02] and they became catholic
[22:08] praise god that spirit just shows itself
[22:13] now remember you're never
[22:16] fighting flesh and blood remember
[22:19] above if you could remember anything
[22:21] remember this and lock it in
[22:23] you are never fighting flesh and blood
[22:26] the moment it becomes a flesh and blood
[22:28] ordeal in your mind
[22:29] you're wrong you've missed the boat
[22:30] you're on the wrong path
[22:32] you better stop and repent and ask god
[22:34] to help
[22:35] but it's spirits that we're fighting and
[22:38] that spirit that
[22:40] that was coming in i mean through the
[22:42] roman system was allow them
[22:44] to have their own religion and then trap
[22:46] them during passover
[22:48] behind the walls of their own religion
[22:50] and then build another wall
[22:52] around their wall and when they build
[22:54] another role a bigger wall around their
[22:56] wall
[22:57] which is the world council the church is
[22:59] an ecumenical move another wall
[23:01] you can keep your wall you can come in
[23:05] for your feast days
[23:07] but once you're inside we're going to
[23:09] build another wall around your wall
[23:12] and when we build that wall we're going
[23:13] to starve you out there's no more
[23:15] spiritual food
[23:18] this is the spirit of rome now
[23:22] that spirit continues
[23:25] and is pervasive and is trying to work
[23:29] on you and me
[23:31] don't throw this off anywhere else that
[23:34] spirit is trying to work on you and me
[23:37] amen that that that you can have your
[23:40] religion
[23:41] that you can build your wall that you
[23:43] can come in behind your wall
[23:44] for safety and security you can keep
[23:46] doing things the way you want to do
[23:48] amen but but there's going to be an
[23:50] overarching authority
[23:51] that's going to be rome and eventually
[23:53] that thing's going to take full control
[23:56] and starve everything out but we've
[23:58] already been told
[24:00] amen just like when jesus christ was
[24:02] here he told the elect and the elect saw
[24:03] the signs
[24:04] and ran from that thing and we're not
[24:06] trapped in that and i say
[24:08] god you have already told us your mercy
[24:10] to your elect
[24:11] has already told us we got to run away
[24:14] from all formalism
[24:16] all traditionalism every sign of
[24:18] denominationalism
[24:19] we must have an individual walk by
[24:21] revelation
[24:22] and come into an individual contact with
[24:25] the seventh seal himself
[24:27] that's the only security that a believer
[24:30] has
[24:31] because we don't want any walls we want
[24:33] to be free
[24:35] we want to be completely free no walls
[24:39] now let's look at genesis chapter 6. i
[24:42] feel like i'm going off like a shotgun
[24:44] here a little bit
[24:44] but god help us let it all come together
[24:48] i pray
[24:49] i pray
[24:56] genesis chapter 6.
[25:00] now i want to look at something here
[25:02] genesis chapter 6
[25:04] we're coming into another type of the
[25:05] sixth seal we're going to see that the
[25:08] earth is going to move into a sixth seal
[25:09] because the sixth seal is the
[25:10] destruction of the earth
[25:12] also in the destruction of the
[25:14] unbelievers
[25:16] and now we're coming to genesis chapter
[25:18] six it's the story of noah
[25:19] and let's just read here starting at
[25:20] verse one and it came to pass when men
[25:23] began to multiply on the face of the
[25:24] earth and the daughters were born unto
[25:26] them
[25:27] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[25:28] and men that they were fair
[25:30] and they took them wives of all which
[25:32] they chose
[25:34] oh praise god
[25:38] what's happening they're starting to mix
[25:43] they're starting to mix and god
[25:46] hated the mixing and god
[25:49] still hates the mixing
[25:53] verse 3 and the lord said my spirit
[25:55] shall not always strive with man
[25:56] for that he also is flesh yet his day
[26:00] shall be a hundred and twenty years
[26:02] there were giants in the earth in those
[26:03] days and also after that when the sons
[26:05] of god came in unto the daughters of men
[26:07] and they bear children to them the same
[26:10] became mighty men which were of old men
[26:12] of renown
[26:14] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[26:16] was great in the earth
[26:18] and that every imagination of the
[26:19] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[26:21] continually
[26:22] and it repented the lord that he had
[26:24] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[26:26] at his heart
[26:27] and the lord said i will destroy man
[26:29] whom i have created from the face of the
[26:31] earth
[26:31] both man and beast and the creeping and
[26:34] the creeping thing and the fouls of the
[26:36] air
[26:36] of it repenteth me that i have made them
[26:39] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[26:42] lord
[26:43] so here we are under the sixth seal and
[26:47] in the sixth seal
[26:48] there's going to be a remnant that finds
[26:51] grace
[26:52] under the sixth seal because that's what
[26:54] we see at the sixth seal
[26:56] under the sixth seal there's a remnant
[26:58] the bride is called
[26:59] amen between the sixth and second
[27:01] seventh trumpet the bride is called
[27:03] and the sixth trump and the sixth seal
[27:04] sound at the same time
[27:06] and you know 144 000 are called so
[27:09] now you see that noah found grace in the
[27:13] eyes of the lord
[27:16] let me let me keep reading these are the
[27:18] generations of noah
[27:20] noah was a just man and perfect in his
[27:22] generations and noah
[27:24] walked with god so let's let's go down
[27:27] to verse 11.
[27:29] the earth also was corrupt before god
[27:31] and the earth was filled with violence
[27:33] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[27:34] it was corrupt for all flesh had
[27:36] corrupted his way upon the earth
[27:38] and god said unto noah the end of all
[27:41] flesh has come before me
[27:42] for the earth is filled with violence
[27:44] through them and behold i will destroy
[27:46] them with the earth
[27:48] make thee an ark of gopher wood room
[27:50] shalt thou make in the ark and shall
[27:52] pitch it within
[27:54] and without with pitch now i just want
[27:57] to take a look and
[27:58] look into this for just a minute now we
[28:00] know this destruction came
[28:02] uh when noah was in his 600th year
[28:06] so in the sixth chapter of genesis in
[28:08] the 600th year of noah
[28:09] we're going to see a type of the
[28:10] breaking fourth of the sixth seal
[28:12] but under the sixth seal which is a
[28:14] judgment seal and god is declaring
[28:16] judgment because man has is hybridizing
[28:20] man
[28:20] is mixing two lines together the the
[28:23] false vine and the true vine
[28:25] amen mixing it together and god hated
[28:28] that mixing
[28:29] but it says but noah found grace in the
[28:31] eyes of the lord
[28:33] and in it verse 9 it says noah was a
[28:36] just man
[28:37] and perfect in his generations now look
[28:40] at that word perfect in his generations
[28:42] that word perfect means whole or
[28:44] complete
[28:46] whole or complete in his generations
[28:47] which means his genealogy
[28:50] that means he was the true seed of god
[28:53] he wasn't mixed amen he was the true
[28:55] seed of god he was perfect in his
[28:57] generations
[28:58] and now you go back to the previous
[29:00] verse and said noah found grace in the
[29:02] eyes of the lord
[29:03] and i want to ask you what did noah do
[29:06] to find grace in the eyes of the lord
[29:09] nothing he was perfect in his
[29:12] generations he was a perfect seed that
[29:14] had come down through
[29:15] he was of the right lineage he was of
[29:17] the right seed now we're looking natural
[29:19] but i want you to look spiritually
[29:21] amen if you're of the right seed if
[29:23] you're of the right if you're perfect in
[29:25] your generations
[29:26] meaning you are a seed that came from
[29:28] the mind of god
[29:30] amen then you're perfect in your
[29:32] generations
[29:33] and you can find grace in the eyes of
[29:35] the lord
[29:36] that's what grace is grace is god's love
[29:39] expressed
[29:40] amen in his love was for his own
[29:43] for his own genes for his own attributes
[29:46] amen and now
[29:46] he noah found grace in his eyes because
[29:49] noah
[29:50] was of the perfect seed line noah was
[29:53] perfect in his generations
[29:54] so what conduct did noah have amen
[29:58] what what what good deed did noah do
[30:01] amen what did noah do
[30:03] if you look down here at verse 11.
[30:08] he says in verse 12 and god looked upon
[30:10] the earth and behold it was corrupt for
[30:12] all flesh had corrupted his way upon the
[30:14] earth
[30:14] everything he saw was corrupt
[30:18] but noah found grace because he was the
[30:21] right seed
[30:23] what did you do to earn the grace
[30:26] that's been extended in you and i
[30:28] nothing but we are perfect in our
[30:30] generations
[30:31] we come from god we go to god what does
[30:34] that mean
[30:34] perfect in your generations and under
[30:37] the sixth seal those who are perfect in
[30:39] their generations will find grace
[30:40] in the eyes of the lord noah found grace
[30:44] in the eyes of the lord praise be unto
[30:46] god
[30:47] so god's grace was going to be extended
[30:52] to noah
[30:53] and the question is how is god's grace
[30:55] going to be extended to noah
[30:57] to escape damnation and judgment god
[31:01] is going to give him a revelation
[31:04] of the pending judgment and he's going
[31:07] to give him
[31:08] the word for his day
[31:11] oh praise god there's no
[31:14] other way to escape damnation and
[31:17] judgment
[31:18] there is no other way than to receive
[31:21] the word for your day
[31:22] [Applause]
[31:24] god because he was because he was
[31:27] perfect in his generation because
[31:29] he received grace amen because he was
[31:32] uh he received grace in the eyes of the
[31:34] lord he was now given a revelation of
[31:37] the word for his day
[31:38] and when that word was made manifest
[31:42] the word for his day was there's going
[31:44] to be rain and there's going to be a
[31:45] flood
[31:46] and you need to build an ark amen so the
[31:48] evidence that he believed that word was
[31:51] that he started building an
[31:52] ark see it doesn't do any good
[31:56] to say that we believe the word and
[31:58] we're not willing to nail
[32:00] boards to the ark amen
[32:03] it doesn't do any good say i believe the
[32:05] message i believe the message i believe
[32:06] the message but we're not spending
[32:08] any time building the ark we're not
[32:10] spending any time in the world we're not
[32:12] spending any time
[32:14] watching it come together because the
[32:16] christ is the ark of safety and christ
[32:18] is the word and he's the word made
[32:20] manifest in your day
[32:22] the word for your day is christ is the
[32:25] ark that we're supposed to get on
[32:27] amen but noah found grace in the eyes
[32:29] the lord was given the revelation
[32:32] that would save his life and that
[32:34] revelation had to move
[32:36] from a revelation in his heart into
[32:38] actions in his body
[32:40] and that word had to be made manifest
[32:42] and when that word was made
[32:44] manifest it was the manifestation of the
[32:46] revealed word
[32:47] to a son of god that brought deliverance
[32:52] and that same story repeats again and
[32:55] again and again
[32:56] what what brings deliverance the
[32:58] manifestation of the revealed word
[33:01] to a son of god brings deliverance
[33:03] [Music]
[33:05] to who to the one that finds grace in
[33:08] his eyes
[33:09] not because they did something special
[33:13] but because they believed his word
[33:17] abraham was justified
[33:21] not in his works but in his faith
[33:24] because he believed the word of god noah
[33:27] was a just
[33:28] man why because he believed the word of
[33:30] god
[33:33] praise god i want to read a bit of a
[33:36] lengthy quote and then i want to get
[33:37] into
[33:38] the real heart of what i want to say
[33:41] brother bam is preaching here in july of
[33:44] 1965
[33:45] he's preaching a message called trying
[33:47] to do god a service without it being the
[33:48] will of god
[33:50] he said i wonder today if all of our
[33:52] drawing in and great crusades and
[33:53] revivals
[33:54] we haven't been filling up the methodist
[33:56] ark the baptist arc the presbyterian art
[33:59] but what about the ark of christ the
[34:01] word
[34:03] and if the bride is to be the word then
[34:05] she's got to be of christ
[34:07] part of the bridegroom she's got to be
[34:10] the word
[34:11] the word not for his day the word for
[34:14] this day
[34:15] oh my goodness i i could explode when i
[34:18] read something like that
[34:19] listen if she if the bride is to be the
[34:21] word then she's got to be
[34:23] of christ that means you come from
[34:25] christ part of christ
[34:28] part of the bridegroom
[34:31] she's got to be the word
[34:34] she's got to be the word the word not
[34:36] for his
[34:38] day you understand
[34:41] there was a word in jesus christ's day
[34:44] when he when he was here
[34:45] in flesh and that was the word for his
[34:47] day she's got to be part of the word but
[34:50] not that part of the word that part of
[34:53] the word was already expressed
[34:54] amen so she is part of the bridegroom
[34:57] she must be of christ
[34:59] part of the bridegroom she must be part
[35:01] of the word
[35:02] amen but not the word of his day
[35:05] now you see what's wrong with the
[35:07] nominationalism looking back to his day
[35:10] and trying to be part of the revelation
[35:12] of his day
[35:13] and they're missing it by a million
[35:15] miles amen because they got to be part
[35:17] of the word
[35:18] but the part of the word for his day has
[35:20] already been spoken
[35:22] it has already been manifest and now to
[35:24] be part
[35:25] of the word you have to be part of the
[35:27] word for
[35:28] your day
[35:31] and that's the bride listen this quote
[35:35] i'm telling you this quote is absolutely
[35:37] lit me on fire
[35:40] the word the word not for his day the
[35:44] word of this day
[35:45] that he promised would be this day that
[35:48] he sent his word forth to mold his bride
[35:50] and make her
[35:51] so what is the what is the objective of
[35:54] the word for this day
[35:56] to mold and make a bride so we are in
[36:00] the bride time or the bride age or the
[36:03] bride manifestation of the word
[36:05] a revelation amen that's got to go
[36:07] beyond
[36:09] just a revelation in the heart but it's
[36:11] got to become a manifestation all over
[36:14] us that there's a manifestation of the
[36:16] bride
[36:17] just like there was a manifestation of
[36:19] the boat amen there's got to be now a
[36:21] manifestation of the bride
[36:24] all right let's keep going
[36:27] he sent forth that he the
[36:30] that he promised would be in this day
[36:32] the word of this day that he promised
[36:34] would be in this day
[36:35] that he sent his word forth to mold his
[36:38] bride and maker
[36:39] hope we see it don't get some idea of
[36:41] your own now and don't take somebody
[36:42] else's idea
[36:43] take the vindicated word here the bible
[36:48] it says god has promised in his word how
[36:51] he will choose his bride in the last day
[36:54] oh
[36:55] we're getting into some good stuff he's
[36:57] he's talking about the choosing of the
[36:59] bride
[37:00] how will he choose his bride he's going
[37:02] to do it by the word
[37:04] and the question is has the word chose
[37:06] you or did you make a decision
[37:11] did you decide to go along with mom and
[37:13] dad did you decide to go along with
[37:14] husband and wife did you decide to go
[37:16] along with a pastor or a teacher or
[37:18] preacher
[37:18] or or or has the word
[37:22] called you out
[37:27] god has promised in his word now how he
[37:29] would choose his bride in the last day
[37:31] did you know that he promised it how he
[37:33] would do it
[37:34] and that by his original plan of
[37:36] choosing christ
[37:37] of choosing the times choosing the
[37:39] seasons he can't miss it on his bride
[37:42] because she is part of the word
[37:44] he can't choose it by a denomination
[37:46] when he didn't choose christ by the
[37:48] nomination
[37:49] did christ come to a denomination did he
[37:51] come by the nomination
[37:52] no they rejected him well that's what
[37:55] the denomination done then
[37:57] then when he chooses a bride can he come
[38:00] any other way
[38:01] he can't choose by denomination or by
[38:04] denominational teaching
[38:08] how did he bring christ here by the word
[38:12] of the prophets
[38:15] how did he bring christ here by the word
[38:17] of the prophets
[38:19] is that right how will he bring his
[38:21] bride here by the word
[38:23] of the prophets
[38:26] how did he identify him when he come by
[38:28] a man with the spirit of elijah upon him
[38:30] come out of the wilderness
[38:31] how will he identify his bride
[38:35] he promises in malachi 4 the same thing
[38:37] before he destroys the earth like it was
[38:39] in the days of sodom
[38:40] now i want to say hold on time out
[38:44] he's saying how did he identify
[38:47] christ in his first coming he said by a
[38:50] man with the spirit of elijah
[38:51] how will he identify his bride wait a
[38:55] minute
[38:55] i thought the voice on the river in 1933
[38:58] said that your ministry will forerun the
[39:01] second coming of christ
[39:02] but he's saying now the spirit of elijah
[39:04] to identify christ
[39:06] is the spirit of elijah that's going to
[39:07] identify the bride
[39:09] of christ because when he identifies the
[39:11] bride of christ he's identifying christ
[39:15] because she's part of christ she's part
[39:17] of the word
[39:18] and she's the word to be on display in
[39:20] this day
[39:21] she is the word for this day just as
[39:24] much as jesus christ was the word for
[39:26] his day
[39:27] now jesus christ in the bride is the
[39:30] word for
[39:31] this day and there'll be a malachi 4
[39:34] ministry with the spirit of elijah
[39:36] just like john the baptist to identify
[39:40] her
[39:42] praise be to god i i was looking for him
[39:45] to point out a man with nail scarred
[39:47] hands
[39:50] i was looking for it to be the exact
[39:52] same way that he didn't know
[39:53] it's the same thing it's always the same
[39:56] thing jesus christ was the word
[39:58] made flesh in his day he was the
[40:00] fullness of the word the completion of
[40:02] the old testament now standing
[40:04] on display and now his bride his wife
[40:07] part of him it's him it's him we've got
[40:10] to get away from the notion of making
[40:12] the bride
[40:12] anything other than him
[40:16] because if we make the bride something
[40:17] other than him then all of a sudden
[40:19] we're
[40:20] false in all of our beliefs and all of
[40:22] our doctrines and all of our teachings
[40:24] but if you make the bride part of the
[40:27] word that's been reserved
[40:28] for a manifestation in this day and it's
[40:31] not your skin
[40:32] it's not your flesh it's not your mom
[40:34] and dad's genetics
[40:36] but it's that very word which come from
[40:38] the mind of god
[40:39] amen that is birthed alive in your soul
[40:41] that is christ down in your soul
[40:44] that's to take dominion over this earth
[40:46] and begin to flesh
[40:48] out the word that's for this day
[40:51] and when that takes place that's christ
[40:57] and if christ when he come to the full
[41:00] measure
[41:00] at the end of the old testament had to
[41:02] be identified with a prophet with the
[41:04] spirit of elijah
[41:05] now when christ is going to come to full
[41:07] identification
[41:08] of his bride at the end of the new
[41:11] testament they're going to have to have
[41:12] a repeat of the same sequence
[41:14] and in the repeat of the same sequence
[41:16] there's going to be a prophet here with
[41:18] the spirit of elijah
[41:19] under the ministry of malachi 4 to
[41:21] identify
[41:22] her
[41:24] [Applause]
[41:26] because she is him
[41:31] oh phrase be the god now you see why
[41:35] denominational understanding's got to
[41:37] crumble
[41:38] because we're talking about the word and
[41:42] the word
[41:42] when it whatever form the word comes in
[41:46] when that word comes in the
[41:47] manifestation that's christ
[41:49] brother said it was christ in jeremiah
[41:51] it was christ in noah
[41:52] it was christ and david it was christ
[41:55] and moses what was it it was christ
[41:57] moses would have ran away to the
[41:59] wilderness and never come back and been
[42:00] a redeemer
[42:01] moses would have failed a hundred times
[42:03] over but it wasn't moses it was
[42:05] christ in moses it's not you
[42:09] you'll fail a thousand times over and
[42:11] get everything as wrong as wrong can be
[42:13] but he didn't leave it up to you in your
[42:15] natural birth
[42:16] amen he left it up to himself through a
[42:18] new birth amen to quicken something he
[42:21] placed inside of you before the
[42:22] foundation of the world and ordained
[42:24] that it would be here
[42:25] and at a certain time he made contact
[42:27] with that to bring that to life so that
[42:29] that
[42:30] would begin to dominate you
[42:33] so that it wouldn't be a life you live
[42:34] but it'd be a life that he lives through
[42:36] you
[42:37] and then when he lives that life through
[42:39] you it would be christ
[42:41] on display
[42:45] and if it's going to be christ on
[42:47] display amen there's going to have to be
[42:49] elijah here to point him out
[42:55] the confusing part is when he pointed
[42:57] out christ
[42:59] he was pointing to a woman
[43:05] it's got everybody all confused
[43:08] well oh no no no that's that's female
[43:13] no jesus christ is male 1
[43:16] that's female well we better wait for
[43:19] it's coming
[43:20] [Music]
[43:23] praise god
[43:27] going on in the same quote says remember
[43:31] sodom burn is that right well this world
[43:34] is to burn
[43:35] jesus said so and it'll be the time that
[43:37] that luke 17
[43:38] chapter 30 verse in the days it'd be
[43:42] like the son of
[43:43] sodom and gomorrah when the son of man
[43:44] would be revealed
[43:46] and then what happened according to
[43:47] malachi he would burn the earth again
[43:49] and the righteous and the millennium
[43:51] will walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[43:53] is that right so we're right at the end
[43:56] time
[43:56] we're sitting here at the door now
[43:58] waiting for him to come
[43:59] notice god promised this his word that
[44:02] he would choose his bride by his
[44:04] original way
[44:05] he chose his the bridegroom he foretold
[44:08] it by the prophets and sent a prophet to
[44:10] identify it
[44:11] so he's going to bring the bride the
[44:13] same way he foretold it by a prophet
[44:15] he's going to send a prophet to identify
[44:17] it
[44:17] it's the same pattern praise god
[44:22] the prophet said standing in the banks
[44:24] of jordan behold
[44:25] they said you're the messiah aren't you
[44:26] he said no i'm not the messiah
[44:28] you must be the messiah he said but i'm
[44:30] not him but he is standing among you in
[44:32] his shoes i'm not worthy to loosen
[44:34] when he comes makes himself known and
[44:37] today he is standing among us in the
[44:39] person of the holy ghost manifesting
[44:41] himself more and more coming into his
[44:43] church
[44:44] making himself known because him and the
[44:47] bride
[44:47] and the groom will be the same make
[44:50] himself
[44:51] known how will he make himself known
[44:53] when the bride and the groom become the
[44:55] same he makes himself known
[44:59] where in her
[45:02] praise god
[45:05] make himself known and one day you'll
[45:07] see that the one that you
[45:09] you'd feel in your heart and see his
[45:11] identification will become
[45:13] personalized before you then you and he
[45:16] are one
[45:17] you've united by the word and the word
[45:21] was in the beginning
[45:22] we'll go back to the beginning which is
[45:24] god
[45:25] said you're united by the word
[45:28] how did i unite with christ by the word
[45:32] when i saw him the word
[45:36] then i could unite with him my husband
[45:39] the revealed word my mate my husband the
[45:43] revealed word
[45:44] i cannot unite with him until i can see
[45:47] him
[45:50] do you understand that i cannot unite
[45:53] with him until i can see him but he said
[45:55] we don't look for nail scars what do we
[45:56] look for the word
[45:58] made manifest and when i would see him
[46:01] as the revealed word
[46:03] made manifest that's my bridegroom
[46:06] that's my husband the revealed word
[46:08] and now i can embrace the revealed word
[46:12] and be united with him
[46:15] praise god
[46:19] you've united by the word and the word
[46:20] was in the beginning with
[46:22] we'll go back to the beginning which is
[46:24] god and that day you'll know that i am
[46:26] in the father the father in me
[46:28] i in you and you and me hallelujah we're
[46:30] here
[46:32] he didn't say it's coming but he gets to
[46:34] that scripture in that day
[46:35] you know that i and the father follow me
[46:37] i in you and you and me
[46:38] what does that make that makes the
[46:40] oneness of the godhead
[46:45] on display where where on earth is it on
[46:48] display
[46:49] in her i in you you and me
[46:52] i am the father the father and me if
[46:54] he's in the father the father's in him
[46:56] and he's in you and you're in him then
[46:58] you guys are all together like this
[47:02] united by the word
[47:05] he said now oh praise god
[47:09] he said now
[47:14] we're here hallelujah i'm so glad to see
[47:17] him
[47:17] personifying himself right among us and
[47:20] see what he's promised for the word
[47:22] not what somebody's emotions singing and
[47:24] jumping and dancing
[47:25] but by his word amen he is making
[47:28] himself
[47:28] known how is he making himself known not
[47:31] through a sensation but he's making
[47:33] himself known by the word
[47:36] praise god and when we see that word
[47:39] that was promised for today
[47:41] and he reveals to us himself to us as
[47:44] the word
[47:45] amen now we see that's him and now we
[47:48] can embrace
[47:49] him and be united with him and we become
[47:52] united
[47:52] by the word what word the revealed word
[47:55] not for his day but for our day
[48:00] we have to know the day we're living in
[48:03] let's turn to isaiah chapter
[48:05] 6 oh i pray that god will put these
[48:09] pieces together friends
[48:11] there is so much i want to say here in
[48:13] the next few minutes
[48:14] and i don't intend to go long i just
[48:16] intend to drop this in as god dropped it
[48:18] in my heart
[48:21] amen i heard a preacher say something
[48:25] recently and when i heard him say it it
[48:27] lit something in my heart
[48:29] it's a brother that i just became
[48:30] acquainted with
[48:32] and i thought oh man i'll get to that
[48:34] someday and that's really good
[48:36] and all of a sudden god just absolutely
[48:38] unlocked it and
[48:39] just drove something into my heart not
[48:41] exactly what the brother
[48:42] said but something that he said just
[48:44] lock unlock something for me
[48:46] and i want by the grace of god to share
[48:48] it with you and i pray that god will
[48:49] unlock something
[48:51] isaiah 6 and 1 isaiah 6 and 1
[48:56] in the year that king uzziah died i saw
[48:58] also the lord sitting upon a throne high
[49:00] and lifted up
[49:01] and his train filled the temple now
[49:04] isaiah brother man preaches it from this
[49:07] text
[49:07] many times in the message influence and
[49:09] in other places and he talks about
[49:11] isaiah isaiah was a true prophet of god
[49:14] he was a true seed of god
[49:15] he was an elective god but he was he was
[49:18] leaning on the arm of flesh
[49:20] he was dependent on uzziah a godly king
[49:23] to get him through
[49:24] and and and we could say it like this
[49:26] isaiah had a church walk
[49:29] isaiah was part of the right church he
[49:32] had there was a good leader
[49:33] amen in the kingdom and and isaiah was
[49:36] part uh of the of the right dispensation
[49:40] i should say that way so isaiah was
[49:42] comfortable and confident
[49:44] just following uzziah's lead but towards
[49:47] the end uzziah
[49:48] got off and he ended in disgrace and
[49:51] and god took him off the earth and in
[49:54] isaiah it threw isaiah into desperation
[49:58] and and this is absolutely perfect
[50:00] friends because
[50:02] the we're in isaiah 6 so what seal do
[50:05] you think we're going to talk about
[50:10] because when you get to the sixth seal
[50:12] the sixth seal can also throw us into
[50:14] desperation
[50:15] amen but in the time of desperation amen
[50:18] there's always something that happens to
[50:20] the elect seed
[50:21] and in the times of desperation the
[50:23] elect seed come in contact with a
[50:25] revelation of god
[50:27] if you look at jacob brother brethren
[50:29] when he preached the sixth seal he went
[50:30] to jacob in jacob's trouble
[50:32] leaving laban's house and we've talked
[50:34] about this recently and traveling over
[50:35] and he's in trouble now because he's
[50:37] going to have to face esau
[50:39] and he's cheated esau he's done wrong to
[50:41] esau and what's amazing to me
[50:43] is at this point in the journey jacob
[50:46] has the birthright
[50:47] and he has the blessing but having the
[50:51] birthright and having the blessing
[50:53] still will not bring security to his
[50:55] heart he's still afraid
[50:56] he's still nervous and it won't change
[50:59] his behavior
[51:00] the very thing that he did to get the
[51:01] birthright amen and to get the blessing
[51:04] is the very thing he did to his
[51:05] father-in-law laban to get all the
[51:07] cattle
[51:09] so he had the blessing he had the
[51:10] birthright but he hadn't had a change
[51:12] yet
[51:15] this is important so now
[51:18] the circumstances come full circle where
[51:21] jacob's in trouble and he knows
[51:24] that he deserves judgment he knows that
[51:27] he's wrong
[51:27] he knows his brother's mad he's assuming
[51:30] his brother is coming to kill him
[51:31] and all that he has and he knows that he
[51:34] deserves it
[51:34] that's the important part of this he
[51:36] knows he deserves it
[51:39] when god allows all of this to throw
[51:42] jacob into a state of desperation
[51:46] amen and the state of desperation is
[51:48] going to put him
[51:49] all by himself he puts his wives and
[51:51] children across the brook across the
[51:53] river
[51:54] he's all alone and when he's all alone
[51:56] he's finally in the place god wants him
[51:58] he's broken
[52:00] amen he's afraid i mean he's unsure he's
[52:03] uncertain and he's all by himself
[52:05] amen praise be to god if we can be
[52:08] broken
[52:09] and walk into that little room amen that
[52:11] little wooden room under the tabernacle
[52:13] all broken and uncertain
[52:15] and not depending on any doctor not
[52:17] depending on any theologian
[52:19] and not depending on anything our
[52:20] parents told us but walk into that
[52:22] little room
[52:23] desperately in need of god to change the
[52:25] situation
[52:26] many of us would come out better but
[52:29] most of the time all we want to do is
[52:31] walk across the platform
[52:32] amen with a group of people and have the
[52:34] same thing everybody else gets
[52:36] but this was a one by one individual
[52:39] getting alone into the little room and
[52:41] coming in personal contact with the
[52:43] shekinah glory
[52:46] and then they came out the other end of
[52:48] the room and they were changed whatever
[52:50] they were before they were different
[52:52] afterwards
[52:52] without the ability to explain the
[52:55] reason for the change
[52:59] the new birth and now
[53:02] jacob's coming to the same place he's
[53:04] guilty he's wrong
[53:06] he deserves what he's got coming amen
[53:08] and in desperation
[53:10] he's all alone and in desperation when
[53:13] he's all by himself
[53:14] there's going to be the seventh seal
[53:17] come to him
[53:19] in a mysterious way
[53:22] at first he won't know what it is but
[53:25] he'll get a hold of it he knows it's
[53:26] something special amen because when we
[53:28] come in contact with it we may not have
[53:30] been able to
[53:31] properly identify it early on but we
[53:33] knew it was something special
[53:34] and we got a hold of it and wouldn't let
[53:36] it go
[53:37] and he gets a hold of this man and won't
[53:39] let him go and he wrestles with the man
[53:41] amen through the night
[53:43] and the man's got to leave he says let
[53:45] me go he said i won't let you go
[53:46] until you bless me jacob had the
[53:48] birthright jacob had the blessing but he
[53:51] needed something more than blessings
[53:53] from god
[53:54] he needed something more than the
[53:55] birthright he needed a change in his
[53:57] walk
[53:58] amen he needed a touch from god that
[54:00] would change him forever
[54:03] and he walks out of this scenario
[54:06] halting on his leg
[54:07] and it changes his walk and he goes and
[54:10] he faces his brother the next day
[54:11] and god takes care of everything see
[54:15] desperation put him in a condition
[54:18] for a revelation and an encounter with
[54:22] the seventh seal
[54:23] jacob left in case we doubt whether
[54:26] that's the counter with the seventh seal
[54:27] when jacob left
[54:28] he said i have seen god face to face
[54:35] so now we go back to isaiah
[54:38] isaiah 6 isaiah is in the same situation
[54:42] his confidence is rattled what he knew
[54:45] to be true
[54:46] what he was depending on he saw fail
[54:49] he's now
[54:50] alone we understand this
[54:54] same pattern he's now alone he said in
[54:57] the year that king uzziah died
[54:59] i saw also the lord sitting upon the
[55:01] throne high and lifted up
[55:02] and his train filled the temple above it
[55:05] stood the seraphims each one had six
[55:07] wings
[55:08] with twain he covered his face and with
[55:10] twain he covered his feet and with twain
[55:12] he did fly
[55:13] and one cried unto another and said holy
[55:16] holy holy is the lord of hosts
[55:18] the whole earth is filled full of his
[55:20] glory
[55:21] and the post of the door moved at the
[55:23] voice of him that cried
[55:24] and the house was filled with smoke then
[55:27] said i
[55:28] woe is me for i am undone because i am a
[55:32] man of unclean lips and i dwell in the
[55:34] midst of a people of unclean lips
[55:36] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[55:38] lord of hosts
[55:39] what did he see he got a revelation of
[55:42] heaven and the holiness of god
[55:43] he got a revelation that caused him to
[55:46] realize
[55:47] that he was unclean see he was part of
[55:50] the church he was part of the system
[55:53] and he was depending on those that were
[55:55] over him amen to set the tone and he was
[55:57] leaning on the arm of flesh
[55:59] and comfortable in his denomination
[56:02] do we see it then his denomination fails
[56:05] amen he sees a failure he he gets alone
[56:09] and all of a sudden because he can find
[56:11] grace in the eyes of the lord
[56:13] what did isaiah do to bring this
[56:16] vision what did he do
[56:21] nothing he didn't have to do nothing
[56:24] because god
[56:25] had mapped out isaiah's life and knew
[56:27] right where he was and
[56:28] knew he was perfect in his generations
[56:30] knew he was an elective
[56:31] and knew when the conditions were right
[56:34] when the man is broken when he's lost
[56:36] confidence in his denomination now is
[56:38] time for me to reveal myself to him
[56:41] and when he caught the revelation from
[56:43] heaven and realized
[56:44] woe unto me i thought i was a christian
[56:50] i hope you've come to that already i
[56:52] hope you've come to the place
[56:54] raised in church always been in church i
[56:56] hope you've come to the place where you
[56:57] realize
[56:58] i thought i was a christian but until i
[57:00] really saw him
[57:01] i realized that i am nothing and those
[57:04] that i'm with are nothing
[57:07] woe unto me for i'm a man of unclean
[57:09] lips amen i'm not even
[57:11] speaking the word right i'm not even
[57:13] confessing the word right because i've
[57:14] never had the revelation of the seventh
[57:16] seal
[57:17] i've been saying what they say before
[57:19] but i'm not even saying the right word
[57:23] you can be quoting the message without
[57:25] the right revelation and not speaking
[57:26] the right thing
[57:32] amen what do we need what do we need we
[57:35] need a revelation
[57:36] of him the one sitting upon the throne
[57:40] a revelation of heaven and recognize his
[57:42] holiness
[57:43] his perfect word how perfect he is in
[57:45] the realms of heaven and we need to
[57:47] realize
[57:47] everything i thought i knew is rubbish
[57:49] and what i thought i was is nothing
[57:51] amen and woe is me for i'm a man of
[57:54] unclean lips
[57:54] and i dwell amongst a people with
[57:56] unclean lips oh my goodness that's the
[57:58] best thing that could ever happen to us
[58:00] jacob got a hold of that one he met
[58:02] because jacob knew
[58:03] that the way he had lived his life
[58:05] wasn't going to work anymore he knew he
[58:07] had to have something
[58:09] more than what he's had before and when
[58:11] he came in contact with something he
[58:12] knew was greater than him
[58:14] which was the revealed word for his hour
[58:16] he got a hold of it and wouldn't let it
[58:17] go
[58:18] until it blessed him and changed him
[58:21] that's what we need not a casual contact
[58:23] with the message of the hour but we got
[58:25] to realize
[58:26] everything about me is wrong and
[58:28] everything about me has failed
[58:29] i don't care if i was raised this way i
[58:31] don't care if i believed it for 40 years
[58:33] but i got to have something that'll
[58:35] change the repeating history of my life
[58:38] failure upon failure upon failure upon
[58:40] failure i can't do it but by the grace
[58:43] of god
[58:44] if i'm perfect in his generations he
[58:46] knows when to open a heaven
[58:48] and give me a vision and show me the
[58:50] thing i've been missing all along
[58:54] i ask you this when isaiah got the
[58:57] vision of heaven
[58:58] was that when heaven appeared is that
[59:01] when heaven come in the
[59:02] and the realization is that when the
[59:04] seraphim started singing
[59:05] no it was happening all around him all
[59:08] the time
[59:08] but he was missing it because he was in
[59:10] his old thinking in his old denomination
[59:12] amen so god has to when he gets to
[59:14] desperation under the sixth seal
[59:16] amen and he's crying out he's needy amen
[59:20] god now opens a vision of what's been
[59:22] going on
[59:23] all around him the whole time
[59:27] it's not a new message we don't have a
[59:28] new message same message
[59:30] but there's those that are catching it
[59:32] and saying it's become a new book to me
[59:34] why because what was going on all around
[59:36] what's going on all around
[59:38] heavenly worship revelation amen a
[59:41] vision of god
[59:42] amen seraphim singing and shouting
[59:43] around the throne it's going on right
[59:45] here right now but we've got to have god
[59:47] open the vision of our eyes to see
[59:49] what's in our hands what's going on all
[59:51] around
[59:54] move from the carnal to the spiritual
[59:58] and god opens his eyes he says woe is me
[1:00:02] woe is me amen
[1:00:06] i'm a man of unclean lips i'm not i've
[1:00:09] not been speaking this thing right
[1:00:12] praise god
[1:00:16] let's read this again
[1:00:19] verse 5 then said i woe is me for i am
[1:00:22] undone because i am a man of unclean
[1:00:24] lips and i dwell in the midst of the
[1:00:26] people of unclean lips
[1:00:27] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[1:00:29] lord of hosts
[1:00:32] who did he see the seventh seal
[1:00:39] you know
[1:00:44] he had religion he had
[1:00:48] religion
[1:00:51] listen he was in the message
[1:00:55] you understand that he was in jerusalem
[1:00:57] he was a prophet he was where god was
[1:00:59] working
[1:01:00] he was in the right dispensation and he
[1:01:03] was the right person
[1:01:05] but he didn't yet have a heavenly vision
[1:01:10] so he's in religion doing
[1:01:13] religious things
[1:01:18] but he realizes in an instant
[1:01:22] how dirty his mouth is
[1:01:26] he realizes in an instant
[1:01:29] how pure this message really is
[1:01:34] because if we can say we believe the
[1:01:36] message and love the message and want to
[1:01:38] be part of the message and go to a
[1:01:39] message church and message his message
[1:01:41] message
[1:01:42] and then absolutely defile our speech
[1:01:46] and don't care about the revelation of
[1:01:49] the word
[1:01:49] and only go to church on sunday and on
[1:01:52] wednesday
[1:01:54] all we have is religion we haven't seen
[1:01:57] the king
[1:01:58] of glory coming yet because if we did we
[1:02:01] realize
[1:02:01] how precious how pure how holy how
[1:02:04] sacred
[1:02:05] this message is it's not something to
[1:02:07] leave on the desk it's not something to
[1:02:09] leave
[1:02:09] amen leave on your phone app that's
[1:02:11] never been touched it's not something
[1:02:13] that we talk about on sunday
[1:02:14] it's not something we give lip service
[1:02:16] to but it is something that's
[1:02:17] more than anything we've ever imagined
[1:02:19] before because this
[1:02:21] message is christ it is the king of
[1:02:23] glory it is the lord of lords it is holy
[1:02:26] and clean and pure and this message will
[1:02:29] sanctify
[1:02:30] all filth out of our lives if we'll let
[1:02:32] it because it's perfect and it's holy
[1:02:34] and it's pure
[1:02:38] sometimes we take it too lightly
[1:02:42] we just take what's all around us too
[1:02:44] lightly
[1:02:45] and we get caught up in the religion of
[1:02:47] the thing and miss what's really
[1:02:48] happening
[1:02:52] he says then
[1:02:56] flew one of the seraphims unto me oh
[1:03:00] praise god
[1:03:04] what did isaiah do to give himself a
[1:03:05] vision nothing
[1:03:10] what did isaiah do to clean himself up
[1:03:14] nothing isaiah
[1:03:18] was a seed of god and at the right time
[1:03:22] god would open heaven and reveal himself
[1:03:24] to isaiah
[1:03:25] and when isaiah caught the revelation of
[1:03:27] the king
[1:03:28] he said what was me woe is me amen i
[1:03:32] dwell amongst
[1:03:33] people of unclean lips i'm a man of
[1:03:35] unclean lips and then
[1:03:36] now and upon his confession and his
[1:03:39] desire
[1:03:40] amen god sends an angel to go get
[1:03:43] something from heaven and bring
[1:03:45] something from heaven
[1:03:47] a perfect burning fire from the altar of
[1:03:49] heaven
[1:03:50] and bring it down and touch him on his
[1:03:52] lips and purge
[1:03:53] him of his iniquity
[1:03:57] what purged him amen when that angel
[1:03:59] took something
[1:04:00] fresh hot alive a living coal
[1:04:03] off the altar of god and brought it down
[1:04:05] and touched him he was purged
[1:04:07] and i want to tell you there's been an
[1:04:09] angel in this day that has reached up
[1:04:11] before the throne of god
[1:04:12] and grabbed a hot burning purifying
[1:04:15] ember of the word
[1:04:16] amen and if you want him to if you can
[1:04:19] confess that i am undone and i am
[1:04:21] nothing
[1:04:22] amen he can bring that angel can grab
[1:04:24] that coal from fire
[1:04:26] from heaven amen and he can touch your
[1:04:28] lips with the pure
[1:04:29] word from the presence of god and purge
[1:04:32] that vessel
[1:04:34] what's gonna do it when i start a good
[1:04:36] works program when i finally quit that
[1:04:38] bad habit
[1:04:38] no first first first first
[1:04:42] he has to come to you and open your eyes
[1:04:44] to see him
[1:04:46] and until that happens nothing else is
[1:04:48] going to happen friend
[1:04:49] you can beg you can plead amen you can
[1:04:52] do whatever you want
[1:04:53] but unless unless god amen opens the
[1:04:56] windows of heaven and opens your eyes
[1:04:58] and lets you see that this is me and
[1:05:01] it's bigger than what you thought
[1:05:04] and when you can catch that and realize
[1:05:06] my religion is worthless
[1:05:08] my righteousness is filthy rags all of
[1:05:10] my service and duty has amounted to
[1:05:12] nothing
[1:05:13] then he's ready to take that prophet
[1:05:15] that angel
[1:05:16] amen and bring that fire down from
[1:05:18] heaven and
[1:05:19] touch you and purge you from iniquity
[1:05:24] that's what this message does amen it
[1:05:27] was the vision
[1:05:28] amen of heaven that opened up isaiah
[1:05:31] amen to his true need
[1:05:33] and it was the vision from heaven that
[1:05:35] purified him in his need
[1:05:38] praise be to god you see why revelation
[1:05:42] is so critical
[1:05:44] you see this is this message
[1:05:48] is not religion this religion
[1:05:52] is about coming in contact with the
[1:05:53] living god
[1:05:56] that's what this message is it's coming
[1:05:58] it's seeing heaven open
[1:06:00] and coming in contact with the living
[1:06:02] god
[1:06:04] and that contact amen will purge you
[1:06:08] and it will change you when jacob came
[1:06:10] in contact
[1:06:11] with that vision of the seventh seal it
[1:06:13] changed him amen when he recognized his
[1:06:15] need he could have made a casual contact
[1:06:17] he said hey how are you
[1:06:18] you look pretty nice to me and let him
[1:06:19] walk on by but he recognized this was
[1:06:22] the thing i needed to change my life
[1:06:25] and isaiah was the same way
[1:06:28] oh praise god let's keep reading for
[1:06:30] just a moment
[1:06:32] then flew one of the seraphims into me
[1:06:34] having a live coal live coal live coal
[1:06:37] live call living word not a dead cold
[1:06:40] not an old coal not a coal from a
[1:06:42] previous dispensation or a previous fire
[1:06:45] a live coal from the altar of god
[1:06:48] not from a textbook not from a church
[1:06:51] system
[1:06:53] off the altar of god having a live coal
[1:06:57] in his hand
[1:06:58] which he had taken with the tongs from
[1:06:59] off the altar and he laid it upon my
[1:07:01] mouth and said lo
[1:07:02] this hath touched thy lips and thine
[1:07:04] iniquity is taken away
[1:07:06] and thy sin purged
[1:07:09] what good deed did he have to do to have
[1:07:12] his sin
[1:07:12] purged nothing all he had to do was see
[1:07:16] god
[1:07:17] recognize his need and call out and
[1:07:19] despair
[1:07:20] and god would make sure the word got to
[1:07:23] him
[1:07:23] amen if he would just hold still and let
[1:07:26] the angel do the work
[1:07:27] the word the live coal off the altar
[1:07:30] would purge him
[1:07:31] of his iniquity and purify his iniquity
[1:07:33] and purge him of his sin
[1:07:36] praise be to god and i heard the voice
[1:07:40] of the lord saying
[1:07:41] whom shall i send and who will go for us
[1:07:43] then said i
[1:07:44] here am i send me that's the process
[1:07:49] friends
[1:07:50] now when isaiah saw heaven open
[1:07:54] and he saw the lord he recognized there
[1:07:57] was a need that he couldn't meet
[1:08:00] but when he recognized there was a need
[1:08:01] he couldn't meet
[1:08:03] then god made sure there was an angel
[1:08:05] there and a living colon everything he
[1:08:07] needed
[1:08:09] to put him in the condition where god
[1:08:11] could use him
[1:08:13] and after isaiah caught the revelation
[1:08:15] of heaven
[1:08:16] and after he went through this
[1:08:17] experience all alone by himself making
[1:08:19] contact with god and being purged by the
[1:08:21] living coal
[1:08:22] after that he said who will go forth he
[1:08:24] said here am i send me
[1:08:25] and after that brother bam said isaiah
[1:08:28] gets the revelation of the seven seal
[1:08:31] book
[1:08:33] what do you mean brother chad brother
[1:08:35] bear said he got the revelation of the
[1:08:37] entire bible
[1:08:38] because he wrote 66 chapters in in
[1:08:41] isaiah and there's 66
[1:08:43] books in the bible he said isaiah wrote
[1:08:46] the whole bible
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:50] what happens when you come in contact
[1:08:52] with a living god
[1:08:53] and you're purged from a living cold off
[1:08:55] the altar you can see
[1:08:57] the whole bible your bible becomes a new
[1:09:00] book the seals tear open the bible
[1:09:02] and now you see the bible that's what
[1:09:05] isaiah that's the revelation isaiah
[1:09:07] isaiah got the revelation
[1:09:09] of the whole bible after this experience
[1:09:13] that's why he wrote 66 books
[1:09:19] and then we find out in the next chapter
[1:09:21] chapter seven
[1:09:24] he gets another revelation of the
[1:09:26] seventh seal
[1:09:29] revelation 7 14 therefore the lord
[1:09:32] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[1:09:34] virgin shall conceive
[1:09:36] and bear a son shall call his name
[1:09:39] emmanuel what is that
[1:09:42] he caught the revelation that god is
[1:09:45] going to come through the virgin
[1:09:49] he caught the revelation that the virgin
[1:09:51] will bring forth christ
[1:09:53] guess what that's still the revelation
[1:09:55] that's ongoing today
[1:09:56] that the virgin amen this virgin bride
[1:09:59] will do all that's written of her
[1:10:01] in the bible concerning the virgin
[1:10:04] same prophecy isaiah caught the
[1:10:06] revelation of it and the revelation is
[1:10:08] continuing to this day
[1:10:12] let's turn over to revelation chapter 4.
[1:10:20] oh praise be to god
[1:10:28] revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[1:10:31] after this i looked after what
[1:10:34] after the church ages
[1:10:37] oh don't you love the word of god
[1:10:41] when did isaiah get a vision of the
[1:10:44] throne in heaven
[1:10:46] after uzziah died after the church
[1:10:49] system in his life died
[1:10:51] after his church ages he saw
[1:10:54] the throne in heaven john is coming
[1:10:58] he's going to see the same vision and
[1:11:00] he's coming to the same experience
[1:11:02] the same way why because prophecy
[1:11:05] repeats
[1:11:07] and history repeats it's got compound
[1:11:09] meaning and compound revelation
[1:11:11] what isaiah saw and went through is what
[1:11:13] john's going to go through
[1:11:15] he said after this i looked and behold a
[1:11:17] door was open in heaven
[1:11:18] and the first voice which i heard was as
[1:11:20] it were a trumpet talking with me
[1:11:22] which said come up hither and i will
[1:11:23] show thee things which must be hereafter
[1:11:26] and immediately it was in the spirit and
[1:11:27] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:11:30] one side on the throne
[1:11:32] and he that sat was to look upon like a
[1:11:34] jasper and a sardine stone and there was
[1:11:36] a rainbow round about the throne in the
[1:11:37] sight
[1:11:39] likened to an emerald and around about
[1:11:42] the throne were four and 20 seats and
[1:11:44] upon the seats i saw four and 20 elders
[1:11:46] sitting clothed in white raymond
[1:11:47] they had on their heads crowns of gold
[1:11:49] and out of the throne proceeded
[1:11:50] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:11:52] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:11:54] burning before the throne which
[1:11:56] are the seven spirits of god
[1:12:00] so now we see that john
[1:12:03] now gets a fission there's a door open
[1:12:05] in heaven he's called up
[1:12:07] in the spirit now he sees now he sees
[1:12:10] one sitting on the throne
[1:12:11] he sees the throne room of god he sees
[1:12:13] all of this going on
[1:12:15] what isaiah saw he now sees when did
[1:12:18] isaiah see it
[1:12:19] after uzziah died when did john see it
[1:12:21] after the church ages
[1:12:23] do you see the pattern
[1:12:26] i'll tell you even if we were born in
[1:12:29] this message
[1:12:30] the church ages have to cease so we can
[1:12:32] see this vision in heaven
[1:12:35] because we can't take it with carnal
[1:12:37] understanding
[1:12:38] it's only going to come by spiritual
[1:12:40] revelation
[1:12:44] so now let's go to chapter 5 verse 1.
[1:12:48] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:12:50] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:12:52] and on the back side and sealed with
[1:12:54] seven seals and i saw a strong angel
[1:12:56] proclaim with a loud voice
[1:12:58] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:13:00] loose the seals thereof
[1:13:02] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[1:13:04] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:13:06] the book
[1:13:07] neither to look there on and i wept much
[1:13:10] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:13:12] and to read the book neither to look
[1:13:14] thereon
[1:13:16] what are we what do we have taking place
[1:13:18] here
[1:13:19] we have a court case
[1:13:23] which is a type of judgment
[1:13:26] john is going through a type of the
[1:13:29] sixth seal
[1:13:31] and after the church ages he's cut up
[1:13:33] into heaven and he sees
[1:13:34] what's going on here and now he sees the
[1:13:37] book the title deed of all redemption
[1:13:39] the book written on the front side on
[1:13:41] the inside sealed with seven seals and
[1:13:43] he sees this book
[1:13:44] and a strong angel proclaims who's
[1:13:46] worthy to take the book
[1:13:48] said no man in heaven on earth or under
[1:13:50] the earth was found worthy
[1:13:51] and i wept amen why was john weeping
[1:13:54] amen because john himself wasn't worthy
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:13:59] now just if you could just listen to me
[1:14:02] for a minute and take what i'm saying
[1:14:05] by default john was judged
[1:14:09] because he knew this was the book of all
[1:14:11] redemption if nobody claimed that book
[1:14:13] all is lost all of earth he himself is
[1:14:16] lost
[1:14:16] and so now because he is not worthy to
[1:14:19] take the book
[1:14:20] he's lost he he's in a desperate
[1:14:22] condition
[1:14:23] he's in a needy condition he needs
[1:14:25] somebody who can take this book
[1:14:27] because no man in heaven no man on earth
[1:14:30] no man under the earth he himself
[1:14:31] couldn't take the book
[1:14:33] but if nobody took the book all is lost
[1:14:35] and now
[1:14:36] john is in desperation under the sixth
[1:14:39] seal
[1:14:40] but praise god john has come from the
[1:14:42] mind of god and his name is on that book
[1:14:45] and so there's got to be one amen who
[1:14:48] can take the book
[1:14:50] and john is now in a desperate condition
[1:14:53] he's just like isaiah
[1:14:55] woe is me for i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:14:58] i'm not able to take the book
[1:15:00] neither anybody that i've ever known or
[1:15:02] any patriarch that i've ever loved
[1:15:04] or anybody i've ever read about in the
[1:15:06] old testament is worthy to take that
[1:15:07] book
[1:15:08] now he's realized religion won't work
[1:15:14] oh praise god friends it's the same
[1:15:16] story over and over and over again
[1:15:20] now he's in this desperate condition
[1:15:23] i can't do it i can't save myself
[1:15:27] if he doesn't do something for me i'm
[1:15:29] finished
[1:15:31] oh do you see how the vision in heaven
[1:15:34] always puts us in the same spot i see
[1:15:38] how perfect i see oh holy i see how pure
[1:15:40] i see how wonderful and i see me and
[1:15:42] there's nothing i can do about it i
[1:15:44] can't bridge this gap
[1:15:47] jacob couldn't do it isaiah couldn't do
[1:15:49] it now john can't do it
[1:15:51] and neither can you and i do it
[1:16:00] so he says in verse 5
[1:16:03] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:16:06] not
[1:16:07] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:16:09] the root of david has prevailed to open
[1:16:11] the book
[1:16:12] and to loose the seals thereof and i
[1:16:15] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:16:16] and the four beasts and in the midst of
[1:16:18] the elders stood on lamb
[1:16:19] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:16:21] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:16:23] spirits of god sent forth
[1:16:25] unto all the earth and he came and he
[1:16:27] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:16:29] him that sat upon the throne
[1:16:31] and when he does worship breaks out in
[1:16:33] heaven
[1:16:35] then we come down to verse 13 in every
[1:16:37] creature which is in heaven
[1:16:39] and on the earth and under the earth and
[1:16:42] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:16:44] in them
[1:16:44] heard i saying blessing and honor
[1:16:47] and glory and power be unto him that
[1:16:50] sitteth upon the throne
[1:16:52] what happened john realized i've been
[1:16:56] saved
[1:16:57] i've been saved i've been saved not by
[1:17:00] my conduct not by my deeds
[1:17:02] not by my church not by the patriarchs
[1:17:05] i've not been saved by
[1:17:06] any man or any system or any teaching
[1:17:09] i've been saved by the seventh seal
[1:17:11] himself
[1:17:11] when he comes and takes the book i'm
[1:17:14] free
[1:17:16] and if you've seen him come and take the
[1:17:18] book amen
[1:17:19] my question is if you have seen him come
[1:17:22] and take the book
[1:17:23] then you should be able to move from
[1:17:25] weeping for all his loss
[1:17:26] to rejoicing for all has been found and
[1:17:29] everything is
[1:17:30] fine there is no problem friends there's
[1:17:32] nothing going
[1:17:33] out of kilter there's nothing wrong why
[1:17:35] because after you left the church ages
[1:17:37] after you came out of laodicea there was
[1:17:40] a window a door open in heaven
[1:17:42] and you saw the mighty god unveiled
[1:17:46] and when you saw the mighty god unveiled
[1:17:48] you realize
[1:17:49] woe is me i'm not able to save myself i
[1:17:52] am nothing i am rotten my flesh is
[1:17:54] rotten
[1:17:55] amen but if you caught the vision amen
[1:17:58] of the seventh seal
[1:17:59] of the lamb taking the book and tearing
[1:18:01] open the seals and revealing the seals
[1:18:03] then all of a sudden you should be able
[1:18:05] to move like john
[1:18:06] moved from weeping and grumbling and
[1:18:09] complaining and saying i'm not worthy
[1:18:11] i'm not able see the problem is we've
[1:18:14] got believers who are still
[1:18:16] stuck pre-seals
[1:18:20] we have believers in the mess we have
[1:18:22] believers stuck pre-seals
[1:18:24] i'm not worthy i'm not able i can't
[1:18:27] overcome
[1:18:31] i say lord give him a vision of the lamb
[1:18:33] taking the book
[1:18:34] give me a vision of the lamb taking the
[1:18:36] book and let it settle in my heart
[1:18:38] forever that everything's redeemed
[1:18:40] everything's fine everything's okay
[1:18:42] nothing now is lost
[1:18:44] i'm gonna make it there's no questions
[1:18:46] and nothing about me is in jeopardy
[1:18:48] anymore
[1:18:49] because i saw the lamb take the book and
[1:18:51] loose the seals thereof
[1:18:53] amen we shouldn't be amen pre-seals in
[1:18:57] our condition all the time
[1:18:58] saying woe is me i'm undone woe is me
[1:19:02] nothing's good low is me look at all the
[1:19:04] problems
[1:19:05] there is no problem the lamb took the
[1:19:07] book and loosed the seals
[1:19:08] and then he sent it down to the seventh
[1:19:10] church age messenger who gave it to me
[1:19:12] and i have now eaten the book and become
[1:19:14] one with christ in the little room
[1:19:16] and i'm united with the word there's no
[1:19:18] more problems friends
[1:19:20] everything is wonderful everything is
[1:19:22] great
[1:19:25] oh i still cry and we still get sick we
[1:19:27] still have those problems but i'm
[1:19:29] talking about a condition of the soul
[1:19:31] that can rejoice in the midst of trouble
[1:19:33] knowing that the lamb has taken the book
[1:19:36] redemption is finalized
[1:19:37] and i'm here in the wrap up moments of
[1:19:40] everything going back to the way it
[1:19:42] should be
[1:19:43] and i'm part of that plan why would i
[1:19:45] weep anymore because the lamb's taking
[1:19:47] the book
[1:19:47] amen it was in jeopardy listen
[1:19:51] it was in jeopardy through seven church
[1:19:53] ages will it be finished will it be
[1:19:55] complete
[1:19:56] we'll all come in
[1:20:00] but when the lamb takes the book there's
[1:20:04] no more questions anymore
[1:20:06] everything's finished how do i get there
[1:20:09] brother chad
[1:20:10] leave laodicea fly a little higher
[1:20:13] if he can open a window in heaven and
[1:20:15] you can see there's more than what i've
[1:20:17] had
[1:20:17] there's more than what i believe there's
[1:20:19] more than the way i've lived and he can
[1:20:21] open a vision of the mighty god
[1:20:23] unveiled amen all you got to do is get
[1:20:25] up into that higher realm
[1:20:27] and say oh god i'm lost and i'm undone
[1:20:30] and i'm unable won't you come and save
[1:20:33] me
[1:20:35] if he can show you the lamb taking the
[1:20:37] book
[1:20:39] and loosing the seven seals thereof
[1:20:42] and you can hear the rejoicing in heaven
[1:20:45] over the lamb
[1:20:46] taking the book then you should be able
[1:20:49] to say
[1:20:49] all that is in heaven all that is in the
[1:20:52] earth all that is on earth
[1:20:53] heard me shouting and screaming and
[1:20:56] praising god
[1:20:58] for my destiny is secure everything is
[1:21:00] fine
[1:21:02] and i ask you friends if you saw the
[1:21:05] lamb take the book and
[1:21:06] open the book and you know you're of the
[1:21:09] book
[1:21:10] what are you part of the words written
[1:21:12] on the book
[1:21:14] if you know that you and your
[1:21:15] redemptions wrapped up in that act
[1:21:17] and you know the completion of
[1:21:18] redemption is wrapped up in the lamb
[1:21:20] taking the book
[1:21:21] then my goodness we should be happy
[1:21:23] people friends
[1:21:24] we should be rejoicing and looking all
[1:21:27] the time for god
[1:21:28] to do wonderful things amen because he's
[1:21:30] got the book
[1:21:31] of redemption and he's given it to us
[1:21:34] we know the story and it doesn't matter
[1:21:36] if i suffer every day of my life from
[1:21:38] now on
[1:21:39] because i saw him loose the seals i know
[1:21:42] amen i know what it's like if i go
[1:21:45] beyond the veil of this life
[1:21:47] i know the green grass and the white
[1:21:49] robes and the saints that are there to
[1:21:50] greet me and hug me
[1:21:51] i know it's perfect love i know it's
[1:21:53] beyond description
[1:21:54] i know it because i saw the seals open
[1:21:58] i know the deliverance that's in store
[1:22:00] for the bride i know the overcoming that
[1:22:02] the bride will have in this last day
[1:22:04] i know why because i saw the seals open
[1:22:06] and if i suffer every day of my life
[1:22:08] nothing's going to change those things
[1:22:11] being true for me
[1:22:12] and if i suffer the next 20 years or 30
[1:22:15] years or 40 years
[1:22:16] i'm still going to be in the millennium
[1:22:18] ruling and reigning with christ for a
[1:22:20] thousand years
[1:22:21] and it will still be far beyond anything
[1:22:23] i've ever imagined in this life
[1:22:25] so everything is fine with me
[1:22:28] if i don't get my prayer request amen if
[1:22:30] i don't get what i want it doesn't
[1:22:32] matter he's already given me
[1:22:34] everything i could want plus more why
[1:22:37] would i want something lousy in this
[1:22:39] life when he's given me everything else
[1:22:41] in the next
[1:22:44] sometimes what we've got to do is
[1:22:46] remember the vision that he's given us
[1:22:48] of heaven
[1:22:49] that we've seen the mighty god unveil
[1:22:51] and we were desperate
[1:22:52] and in our desperation as a human being
[1:22:55] you saw the lamb
[1:22:56] to you before your eyes he took the book
[1:22:59] and loosed the seals
[1:23:02] and then you realized everything's fine
[1:23:04] with me
[1:23:06] if i suffer i suffer it doesn't matter
[1:23:10] because now my vision's been lifted
[1:23:12] above the church ages
[1:23:15] and now i can see beyond
[1:23:18] jesus for the glory that lay ahead
[1:23:21] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:23:24] why because he had vision of what was
[1:23:26] coming next
[1:23:29] can we have a vision of what's coming
[1:23:32] next praise god
[1:23:37] brother branham i just want to finish
[1:23:40] for a few minutes with this last
[1:23:42] bit of thought here
[1:23:47] brother branham comes to serve is this
[1:23:50] the sign of the answer
[1:23:52] he's going to talk about the vision he's
[1:23:54] had of going out west and
[1:23:56] and then he's going to talk about
[1:23:57] getting caught up in the constellation
[1:23:59] of seven angels
[1:24:00] which told him to go out west for the
[1:24:03] revelation of the
[1:24:04] seven thunders and then come back or the
[1:24:06] revelation to the seven seals and come
[1:24:08] back
[1:24:10] and he says here's what brother graham
[1:24:13] says he gets down to the end of that
[1:24:14] message
[1:24:15] he said i feel like isaiah in the temple
[1:24:18] that day
[1:24:19] when he saw the angels flying back and
[1:24:21] forth with wings over their faces and
[1:24:22] over their feet and flying with wings
[1:24:24] holy holy holy
[1:24:26] oh how that young prophet was shook he
[1:24:29] began to age
[1:24:30] up a bit and when he seen that though he
[1:24:32] had seen visions he screamed out
[1:24:34] what was me father maybe i felt somewhat
[1:24:36] like that when i seen those angels the
[1:24:38] other night or the other morning rather
[1:24:40] woe is me
[1:24:41] for i'm a man of unclean lips and i
[1:24:42] dwell among an unclean people
[1:24:44] father cleaned me
[1:24:47] when isaiah got a heavenly vision
[1:24:51] it put him in desperation when john
[1:24:54] got a heavenly vision and put him in
[1:24:56] desperation when brother branham gets a
[1:24:58] heavenly vision it puts him in
[1:25:00] desperation
[1:25:02] why i'm telling you if you ever really
[1:25:05] see what this message is
[1:25:07] it'll throw you in desperation you'll
[1:25:10] cry for god to change you because you
[1:25:12] can't go on like you were and be the
[1:25:13] bride of jesus christ there's got to be
[1:25:15] a change
[1:25:17] there's got to be a manifestation of
[1:25:18] where there's got to be a living life
[1:25:20] living through me
[1:25:21] there's got to be something there's got
[1:25:24] to be a change for this is real this
[1:25:26] isn't another church this is real
[1:25:28] this isn't another denomination this is
[1:25:30] the reality of christ
[1:25:31] living in a people it's real
[1:25:35] it's not lip service it's not something
[1:25:36] we talk about it's the reality friends
[1:25:41] he says now i feel like
[1:25:45] isaiah i've seen heaven open i caught a
[1:25:48] vision
[1:25:49] and it put brother branham in
[1:25:50] desperation this is what he says
[1:25:53] and here i am send me lord
[1:25:56] whatever it is i stand at this pulpit
[1:25:57] where i've been for 30 years
[1:25:59] if there's something lord you want me to
[1:26:00] do here i am i'm ready lord
[1:26:02] but may i find grace in your sight
[1:26:04] humbly i pray
[1:26:06] you are god and there is no other but
[1:26:07] you receive us lord forgive us of our
[1:26:10] sins
[1:26:10] i'm repenting from all my unbelief for
[1:26:13] all my iniquity
[1:26:14] i plea on the altar what does brother
[1:26:16] abraham do he saw a constellation of
[1:26:18] seven angels he got caught up in that
[1:26:20] constellation he saw the vision
[1:26:21] he interpreted the dreams he knows he's
[1:26:23] to go out west for the interpretation of
[1:26:25] the seven seals and he knows that comes
[1:26:27] right out of revelations 10 he already
[1:26:29] quoted it
[1:26:30] and he knows that's the tie into
[1:26:31] revelations 5. he knows all of those
[1:26:33] things
[1:26:34] and when he saw that vision it put him
[1:26:36] in desperation
[1:26:37] because there's no way he as a man can
[1:26:39] do that
[1:26:40] there's no way he can interpret that
[1:26:42] there's no way he said could this be the
[1:26:43] interpretation of the seventh thunders
[1:26:45] could that be
[1:26:45] it friends could it be this could it be
[1:26:47] that and he knows he's completely
[1:26:49] insufficient and completely incapable of
[1:26:51] handling something so holy
[1:26:53] and when he saw the vision it put him in
[1:26:56] desperation
[1:26:58] and he started to repent
[1:27:01] started to say forgive us of our sins
[1:27:04] i'm repenting for
[1:27:05] all my unbelief this is a prophet of god
[1:27:08] 1962 i'm repenting for all my unbelief
[1:27:13] for all of my iniquity i plea on the
[1:27:15] altar of god
[1:27:16] god people don't understand that they
[1:27:18] think it would be so much
[1:27:19] joy but lord what a weary what a
[1:27:21] dreadful thing for a human
[1:27:23] being to come in the presence of a great
[1:27:25] mighty being of god
[1:27:26] i pray for forgiveness of my little
[1:27:28] church here that you sent me down
[1:27:30] to lead into guide then further down he
[1:27:33] says every one of you
[1:27:34] cleanse all your heart why because he's
[1:27:38] standing in the junction
[1:27:39] standing in the breach standing in this
[1:27:42] spot where he knows
[1:27:43] some another revelation has to come amen
[1:27:46] the seven seals have to open but he
[1:27:48] can't open it
[1:27:49] and the only one who can open it amen is
[1:27:52] one who doesn't have dirty hands and
[1:27:54] dirty lips
[1:27:56] and in this state he recognizes he needs
[1:27:59] something he's like jacob he's like
[1:28:02] isaiah
[1:28:02] he's like john amen there's nobody
[1:28:05] worthy
[1:28:06] woe is me i'm weeping because nobody's
[1:28:08] worthy and he's telling the church
[1:28:10] cleanse your heart
[1:28:11] i repent you repent let's all repent why
[1:28:14] because he's in the junction he's seen
[1:28:16] the heavenly vision he knows what time
[1:28:18] we're coming to
[1:28:18] but he can't do it
[1:28:22] it's going to take christ himself the
[1:28:25] mighty angel descending
[1:28:27] to do it and then after you see
[1:28:30] christ himself come down and open the
[1:28:33] seals
[1:28:35] then we move to rejoicing and shouting
[1:28:38] and praising and all the hallelujahs
[1:28:41] ringing out because we've made it
[1:28:42] through the breach
[1:28:44] we've made it through the transition
[1:28:46] we've moved from the church ages
[1:28:48] to the heavenly realm and we've seen the
[1:28:50] seals open
[1:28:55] brother branham had a difficult job
[1:29:00] he he was the prophet of the age like
[1:29:03] isaiah
[1:29:04] when isaiah come to the vision of heaven
[1:29:06] and said what was me
[1:29:07] isaiah was purified from the living coal
[1:29:10] and when isaiah was purified he saw the
[1:29:13] whole word
[1:29:14] is that right john comes to the same
[1:29:18] place
[1:29:18] and john says woes me but when he sees
[1:29:20] that there's a bleeding bloody lamb that
[1:29:22] died in his stead that could take the
[1:29:23] book and loose the seals
[1:29:25] now he begins rejoicing and after john's
[1:29:27] rejoicing
[1:29:28] what does john see john sees the whole
[1:29:31] word unveiled
[1:29:32] and he hears the revelation of the seven
[1:29:35] thunders
[1:29:36] which is the mystery of the seals john
[1:29:39] gets the revelation of the whole thing
[1:29:42] and what happens to brother branham
[1:29:45] the same pattern
[1:29:50] i tell you friends i think the same
[1:29:54] thing can happen to you and i
[1:29:56] yes i think the same thing can happen to
[1:30:00] you and i
[1:30:01] lord you've opened my eyes enough to see
[1:30:04] the mighty god unveiled
[1:30:06] i know this message is true i know this
[1:30:08] is you and i know you're the mighty god
[1:30:12] but woe is me and god there's not a
[1:30:15] living soul that can help me
[1:30:18] i can't help me nobody else can help me
[1:30:21] there's not a church that can help me
[1:30:22] if i can't get help in this church the
[1:30:24] next church ain't going to do it
[1:30:29] if it's this one or this denomination or
[1:30:31] that one or this way of thinking
[1:30:32] it's not going to help me god i've seen
[1:30:35] how pure you are
[1:30:37] and how fallen man is and there's nobody
[1:30:40] that can bridge the gap
[1:30:42] i need you to bridge this gap for me
[1:30:46] and i need you i need to see you
[1:30:50] open the seals for me
[1:30:54] and when god can open the seals for you
[1:30:57] and i
[1:30:58] individually then we begin to see
[1:31:02] 66 books we begin to see
[1:31:07] one story one theme one goal god has had
[1:31:11] all this time
[1:31:12] and every character and story and type
[1:31:14] has been to reveal
[1:31:15] this one goal that god has
[1:31:21] i'm going to stop
[1:31:25] but i want to share one more thing
[1:31:29] but i just want to leave this right here
[1:31:30] i just feel to leave this right here
[1:31:34] the same pattern is unfolding and once
[1:31:36] we see
[1:31:38] when god comes down and does something
[1:31:40] for us and opens our eyes and cleanses
[1:31:42] us by the word
[1:31:43] it opens up 66 books when the seals are
[1:31:46] opened by the lamb
[1:31:47] when we see the lamb take the book not
[1:31:50] because somebody else said so
[1:31:52] you understand friends not because
[1:31:54] somebody said it happened
[1:31:56] but because it happened to me i got the
[1:31:59] revelation
[1:32:00] i saw the vision john saw
[1:32:03] the lamb open the book
[1:32:06] that was important because then he
[1:32:08] wasn't depending on the angels to
[1:32:09] worship because the angels worshiped
[1:32:11] because they saw it
[1:32:12] that everybody else worshiped in heaven
[1:32:14] because they saw it but
[1:32:16] john can only worship himself because
[1:32:18] john saw it
[1:32:20] and if we're going to worship the one
[1:32:22] who's opened the seals then
[1:32:24] we have to see him open the seals he's
[1:32:27] got to reveal himself
[1:32:28] to us individually
[1:32:33] amen praise god
[1:32:37] oh i'm going to stop let's all stand
[1:32:41] god bless you i don't want to go any
[1:32:43] further because i want to end right
[1:32:45] there
[1:32:46] on that note musicians if you could come
[1:32:50] everything went completely different
[1:32:52] backwards than i expected god changed it
[1:32:54] all just a little bit ago
[1:32:56] but i hope like anything else you can
[1:32:58] see the pattern
[1:33:00] see the pattern and this message came to
[1:33:03] open our eyes
[1:33:04] this message came to lift this out of
[1:33:06] the
[1:33:07] to take the same journey isaiah took the
[1:33:09] same journey john took the same journey
[1:33:11] brother branham took
[1:33:12] it came to do the same thing for you and
[1:33:14] i it's not good enough that isaiah did
[1:33:17] it
[1:33:18] and wrote 66 books you understand that
[1:33:21] it's not
[1:33:22] good enough that john did it and was
[1:33:24] able to hear the thunders
[1:33:25] it's not even good enough that brother
[1:33:27] branham moved through this progress
[1:33:28] and he got the interpretation of the
[1:33:30] thunders that's not good enough yet
[1:33:33] amen because god wanted this book to
[1:33:36] come back into the hands of his elect
[1:33:38] seed
[1:33:40] and now we've got to go through the same
[1:33:43] process
[1:33:45] and now the prophecy is being revealed
[1:33:48] in a revolving history
[1:33:51] for me now it's my turn
[1:33:56] it was isaiah's turn it was john's turn
[1:33:58] it was brother branham's turn
[1:34:00] but now it's my turn now it's my turn
[1:34:04] and how am i going to get my eyes open
[1:34:06] there's nothing you can do to open your
[1:34:08] eyes
[1:34:09] how am i going to find grace under the
[1:34:10] sixth seal
[1:34:12] i don't know noah found grace in the
[1:34:15] eyes of the lord not in his own eyes
[1:34:19] and god can open something in your heart
[1:34:23] to where you can say this is god
[1:34:27] i know that this message is god
[1:34:31] i know that this is heaven open for me
[1:34:34] i know it because heaven is consistent
[1:34:37] of the word
[1:34:38] and when you open the word he opened
[1:34:40] heaven and when he opened heaven you
[1:34:42] could see god
[1:34:44] because god is his word and you say i
[1:34:47] know this is god
[1:34:48] but god who is me can you
[1:34:51] take a living coal off the fire and
[1:34:54] cleanse my lips
[1:34:56] can you give me eyes to see that book
[1:34:58] opened up
[1:34:59] can i see what isaiah saw 66 books
[1:35:03] can i see the whole word opened up in
[1:35:06] the mystery
[1:35:08] it's not about knowledge kick that out
[1:35:11] of your mind right now
[1:35:12] i feel that coming right now it's not
[1:35:15] about understanding
[1:35:17] and being able to recite those seals
[1:35:19] mean this verses it's not about that
[1:35:21] the opening of the seals is christ
[1:35:24] coming to you personally
[1:35:25] and revealing that you're the mystery
[1:35:29] you're the secret of the seventh seal
[1:35:32] what's the secret of the seventh seal
[1:35:35] he's coming in the virgin
[1:35:38] and you're the virgin that he wants to
[1:35:40] come in
[1:35:42] what do you mean brother daddy open the
[1:35:43] scissors if i haven't seen him open the
[1:35:45] seals
[1:35:45] i'm not talking about telling me what a
[1:35:47] white horse is and what a red horse is
[1:35:48] and what a black horse is
[1:35:50] i'm talking about the secret of it all
[1:35:53] and the secret of it all is the bride
[1:35:55] coming of christ
[1:35:56] not so you can say bride coming of
[1:35:58] christ so that you can
[1:36:00] be the bride coming of christ
[1:36:05] and we've got to go through this journey
[1:36:08] so that we can rejoice and say
[1:36:11] he's opened the seals to me he's opened
[1:36:14] the seven
[1:36:14] is the seventh seal open it's not
[1:36:16] debatable anymore
[1:36:20] you can debate others can debate but you
[1:36:22] won't suck me into debate
[1:36:24] because the seventh seal has opened
[1:36:26] right here
[1:36:29] and i don't need a quote to see it
[1:36:32] i met the one who gave all the quotes
[1:36:37] do you understand it's not religion it's
[1:36:39] not a doctrine it's not fussing it's not
[1:36:41] fighting
[1:36:41] it is seeing god it is seeing heaven
[1:36:45] it's seeing heaven open it's recognizing
[1:36:48] your need and it's watching him come
[1:36:50] down
[1:36:50] and break the revelation right to your
[1:36:52] heart you're my sweetheart
[1:36:54] and i want to marry you that's it
[1:36:58] not for the neighbor not for the person
[1:37:00] over here but for me
[1:37:03] so i want to ask you is the seventh seal
[1:37:06] open
[1:37:09] it's open and it's alive
[1:37:14] and i can't prove it by nothing else
[1:37:17] than my own experience and what's alive
[1:37:19] in my heart
[1:37:21] and it's christ god took isaiah through
[1:37:25] god took john through god took brother
[1:37:27] branham through
[1:37:28] and god has taken me through too i may
[1:37:31] not be able to explain it like john
[1:37:33] would explain i may not be able to
[1:37:34] explain like brother branham would
[1:37:35] explain it i may not even be able to
[1:37:36] explain it but one thing's for sure i
[1:37:39] experienced it
[1:37:40] and it's released a joy and rejoicing in
[1:37:43] my heart like none other
[1:37:44] and now i don't need angels to sing and
[1:37:47] i don't need my neighbors just saying
[1:37:49] i can sing myself because i s he's
[1:37:51] opened the seals
[1:37:53] i can worship and rejoice with a pure
[1:37:55] worship because he sanctified my lips
[1:37:57] with the living cold of word and he's
[1:37:59] opened the seals to me
[1:38:02] is he here he's here
[1:38:05] where is he at it's a mystery friends
[1:38:08] it's not a mystery i can solve for you
[1:38:10] it's a mystery only he can solve for you
[1:38:14] amen let's pray lord jesus we thank you
[1:38:18] for your word
[1:38:20] god only you know what you're trying to
[1:38:23] accomplish right now

[1:38:30] idea i felt you're leading lord and then

[1:38:57] anointed preaching of the word and let

[1:39:03] for help

[1:39:48] of your word
[1:39:49] seeing the beauty of your word but
[1:39:51] knowing we have a lack lord
