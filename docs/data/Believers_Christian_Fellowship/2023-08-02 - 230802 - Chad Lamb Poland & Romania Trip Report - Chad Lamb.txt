wonderful love oh we'll give the glory of his love [Applause] will give the glory to Jesus wonderful you may be seated it's good to be back and just wanted to tell a little bit about our trip tonight also and uh it was a long 12 days but it was worth it was good to see the the Saints and uh it's it's very interesting you know when you go and you see the different languages and the different cultures and things but there's always you know the one thing that brings us together it's the word of the hour and it's so nice to see how they worship and uh you know just their whole lifestyle and when they sing they really sing they put their whole heart into it and uh when we headed out I know we were having a heat wave here and also we were supposed to heat be a heat wave over there in Romania too and so uh at the campgrounds it was in a tent they had a set of tent up so it had been very very hot it would have been 90 95 degrees in that tent and they had between five and six hundred people but uh we were praying that the Lord would take care of it and he did we had a thunderstorm roll through the night before and it stormed and then the temperatures from there on hour like 75 degrees during the day and 55 at night so it was very nice a wonderful time there was um I think four people that got baptized after the morning services they had a nice mountain river that ran right through there and so they would just go back behind the cabins there in the river and baptize the people so it was really nice we started out in the Poland I think we uh four or five days in Poland I think brother Chad preached four times in six days when we first got there um I felt bad for them they kept adding days and adding days you know he looked on his phone and they would say brother we want you to take the first three services and then they'd add another one and add another one and a thing before he got done he preached nine times and then and because I think you know three days of travel we were gone 12 days so he you know he preached quite a bit and I think the one Saturday morning he preached three consecutive Services preached the morning service we took an hour break for lunch and then they come back and he had to preach to the couples right after the couples they moved the couples out of the tent and then moved the ministers in the tent and he preached to them for about an hour and a half so it was quite quite the day so I'm sure he's quite worn out but he was a blessing to the people and a lot of the Saints they they send their greetings to you and you wouldn't believe how many people stream in and they want to thank the musicians a lot of them say tell you musicians uh you know thank you they enjoy the music and a lot of them the services they stream our services constantly and Romanian I think there's almost eight to ten different countries that were there from Spain to Hungary to Czech Republic Moldova Romania Germany I know I'm forgetting some but they're all all UK and they all came and it's amazing how they can even though there's a language barrier but they figure it out somehow you know they may know a little bit of Romanian or they may know a little bit of Polish but there's you know it's being translated from English the Polish and in Romanian but like the people from Hungary they don't understand any of it so their pastor will listen to the English because he understands English and they'll put a headset on and he will speak it so his congregation can hear or his little flock that he brought so they can hear it in Hungarian but it's really something to see the different bride around the world so I don't want to take too much brother Chad will cover the rest of it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] worship as we live your holy name you deserve the Lord Glory [Music] Lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy name Library foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] there is no line [Applause] there is no known as like you [Music] I just want to please the Lord in his willingness it is like this hear you say Well done [Music] I just want to please [Music] [Music] [Music] I just want to please the Lord [Music] is presence found in his likeness to hear him say Well done something amen God bless you all certainly good to see all your faces amen it's good to be home let's bow our heads together and let's pray oh Heavenly Father how grateful we are to be gathered back together in this place again but I appreciate Lord all you've done for all of us Lord God I pray that you bless us now as we share the things that you have done over the last few days for us Lord we realize you've been so faithful to each one of us you watched over us and kept us and protected us guided us and sheltered us we love you for it Lord pray that you bless us as we look into your word also that you would Lord just that you would give us understanding that you would give us Lord the heart to perceive all that you want to share with us today Lord I pray that you would take the preeminence Among Us and you'd be glorified in all we say and do for we love you Lord we want to lift you on high we want to give you the preeminence that you deserve for we want to yield Our Lives to you in every way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while you're standing let's turn to Proverbs chapter 25 and we read one scripture and then we'll let you be seated and we'll do a bit of a trip report it is certainly very good to be home Amen brother Jonathan and I arrived at about 1 30 a.m this morning and slept a few hours and we've had a good day so we thank God for taking care of us giving us energy and strength and I've been excited to get to this point in the day to see everyone once again Proverbs chapter 25 let's read this one scripture verse 25 Proverbs 25 and 25. as cold Waters to a thirsty Soul so is good news from a far country man God bless you as you take your seats amen I've I've read that scripture numerous times and a trip report as we come back but it's always the same it's true amen no matter how many times we read it it doesn't change the fact that it's true amen good news from a far country is refreshing amen and then we're going to get into a bit of a trip report and I'll share just a few Thoughts with you from the word as we go into that but first I want to bring greetings from everyone to everyone else there was just too many names to list from too many to to to you all amen then brother Jonathan shared some of that but especially from brother yatzik brother Samuel those Brothers who've been here before brother Nathan they really want to send greetings to all of you all of their friends all the familiar faces God bless you all and like Jonathan was sharing so many wanted to express their thanks and gratitude to the whole congregation they just appreciate the whole body here especially the song leaders and the musicians they numerous people wanted us to thank the song leaders and the musicians and I just want to say thank you and God bless you for all that you do it's a blessing to all of us we've known it for so long we appreciated every service but it's also affecting the lives of others and it's been encouragement and a blessing to them and so yeah this has been uh this has been a good trip it was a very very tiring trip very tiring trip and I was so thankful that brother Jonathan was able to come along uh instantly when I decided that I would come to Romania which was a trip that had been canceled a couple times we were supposed to go but had been canceled a couple times I instantly thought of brother Jonathan because you may or may not know some of you may know but sister Irina was born in Romania and so that's her birthplace her father was responsible for translating a multitude of of sermons into Romanian he was the main translator for years for voice of God into the Romanian language so everybody there knows her family and she's famous which made brother Jonathan famous he was he was famous by proxy Association amen and also sister irina's brother does the voiceovers for the tapes so he's the Romanian voice of brother Branham in Romania so they all know her brother they all know her father and know the family so it was very fitting but brother Jonathan would join in and and he made so many connections and so many people knew of her family so it was a lot of fun to have him along and and people really lit up when he told him who he was married to and who her family was and so brother brother Jonathan you're gonna have to take your wife they're all waiting for her to come so hopefully you get a chance to go back amen we want to thank everybody who was praying for us it was really needed I can I can tell you that I needed it but God came through and it was a huge blessing I just there was there was almost like a supernatural strength if I could say it that way something that is just beyond human ability and I know it was the saints that were praying and many of you sent a little text a note dropped a little note and I want to say thank you I appreciate that very very much it warmed my heart made me feel good to know that those were remembering to pray and they dropped a little note or said something in a text I would say God bless you all each one who did that and all who didn't text I know there's many praying as well and it was a real blessing to me to brother Jonathan we appreciated it the trip went really well all the flights all the exchanges everything went fantastic and so I thank God for that also I want to thank the brothers who preached here while I was gone on the flight back we had a long flight back across the ocean and I had a chance to listen to all three sermons in a row and I was blessed by each one of them it was an absolute blessing I'm so thankful for the brothers who were able to take the services and I mean I missed them when they were priest here but I got to listen to them back to back and that was really special amen they all were feeding off one another was quite a blessing appreciated brother John Kadima coming back and sharing what the Lords are doing amen so just remember to keep them in prayer I'm really excited for what God's doing for the Saints in that area um you know when brother John started helping out over there he had no vision of what would happen no idea and it was just a small group amen but he didn't realize there was a lot of Believers in that area that had no place to go and brother John didn't know that they were driving some of them two or three hours just to have fellowship and there was actually quite a number of Believers there and after brother John started a church and people knew there was a pastor and they had voted him in his pastor and they found a place one by one they're gathering in they have visitors almost every service so you can see the hand of God God wanted to do something in Pittsburgh and I have in my flesh I should say I have mourned the loss of Brother John his amens were so encouraging having him here all the time plus he was a veteran Minister been ministering so long and started numerous churches he was just good to have around he was good to minister we all enjoyed him but but it's pretty selfish of us to want to hold on to him when there's such a need there and so I'm so thankful that he's there that he's ministering so it was great to have him come back and give an update and show some pictures and I just want to remind you all if any of you are going out to Lancaster County to go visit the Amish out there and go Sight and Sound Theater like some of you do if anybody takes a vacation that way include brother John in your stop amen stop over there for a service it would encourage him and I'm sure you would be blessed appreciate Brother Kyle taking the Wednesday night service and also I want to give you an update I had said he was supposed to go last Sunday to Junction City but I didn't know at the time I made the announcement that they had made some change in the schedule down in Junction City but he'll be going this Sunday so remember to pray for those Services Brother Kyle will be there this Sunday and then also at the end of the month he's going out to visit Brother Rich Cobb in Oregon for the weekend of the 26th and 27th so keep him in prayer and then I appreciate it brother Emmanuel I appreciate that service Sunday brother Emmanuel was a real blessing and also want to let you know brother Emmanuel will be traveling to the Congo leaving August 8th is that right brother uh August 9th it'll be gone for about a month amen so be praying for him they've got a lot of services planned he's going with brother Randy Cyrus and him and brother Randy will be going together to the Congo and they're probably going to preach 30 or more times right brother amen so there you go so be I imagine he'll appreciate I was gone 11 12 days and I needed lots of prayer a whole month brother we're gonna have to pray a whole lot for you amen so remember to keep him in prayer as he travels as well that God would guide them God would bless them amen as you all know while we were gone our brother Mark coli passed away and it was quite a shock I was shocked when I got the news and quite a surprise and you all know that really has changed the lives of those five children just immediately and also brother Les and sister Kelly coli so I appreciate everybody gathering around them to support them to show them love to pray for them I really appreciate the sisters who jumped on board quickly to start preparing meals I just want to say God bless you all I'm sure they're going to need all the encouragement all the love all the prayers all the whatever support we can give in the coming weeks and months but you know all I can say is if God trusted job God really trusts brother lesson sister Kelly and knows what's in them and and what they can do and provide for those five children and so I say let's do all we can to help them and love them and pray for them and don't forget to drop them a little notes into my car and hug their neck when you see them and the kids and welcome them and let them know that we're for them we're here to help in any way that we can we'll grieve with them we'll Rejoice with them we'll help in any way possible but that was quite a challenge I called brother Les to check up on him today and I asked him how he was doing he said oh I'm doing fine and he said his well pump went out today and so they had a problem with the well pump lost water had no water all day that's why they weren't able to make it this evening and I thought my goodness what a stack of Trials there must be huge blessings in store there must be tremendous things God's wanting to do because it's sure been a trying time so just remember them in prayer I think brother Tommy was able to go and help him out today and they were able to get things hopefully by now get things going but yeah I just when things like that happen one after the other at the other we can go into despair we can say God is God he's on the throne he's Mighty he wants to show himself Mighty God's going to do something special through all of this I believe with all my heart so just remember them in prayer hey man if we could pull up the PowerPoint brother Franco let me go into that also I want to say it's been good to have sister Hannah Levy here God bless you Sister Hannah I know she'll be leaving this Sunday to go back to Arkansas but it's been good to have you here amen's been good to see you in your seat worshiping the Lord so we'll miss you when you're gone but it's been nice to be together hey man let's look at this PowerPoint together I want to show you some pictures and explain to you some of the trip it was uh it was quite nice uh to go back to Poland and see the Believers there again we went to two places we went to Poland and we went to Romania you can see their proximity to one another there I was originally only going to go to Romania Romania was on my heart like I told you before we had tried to schedule this twice and it got canceled because of covert restrictions and brother yatzik had called earlier in uh in the year and he had asked me to come and I told him I was just too busy I wasn't able to make it and I couldn't do it this year and so he called me back two three weeks later and he said I was walking and praying brother Chad and it just come on my heart not to give up so easily so he called and he says brother I really really would like for you to come and I went through the list I said no bro I just I don't think that I can I'm too busy and I said I've got to go to this place and I've got to go to this place I've got to go to this place and I mentioned Romania and he goes Romania that's not far away brother you could you could combine us and them together and and after a man's been walking and praying and feeling like you ought to try again it's hard to wiggle out of that amen so that's what we did we just extended the trip a little bit and stopped in Poland first and then went down to Romania this is a picture brother Jonathan and I in the in the plane you can see everybody's boarding this is the beginning of our trip I I still I'm I'm a grandpa now an elderly so I have an excuse for not mastering the art of selfies I'm still terrible at it and I hope I never get good at it really actually I hate the whole technology end of things and now that I'm a grandpa I can say stuff like that I hate those newfangled things praise God but I may never get it right but that's okay I always look at the wrong end of the camera and my kids make fun of me but I got to do something to have them have some pleasure and enjoyment in life you know so brother Jonathan snapped up this picture I wasn't aware he was taking it but this is this is actually a lot of my travel time whenever I'm traveling especially when I travel alone and there's nobody to fellowship with this is this is what I do this is what I do in airports is what I do on airplanes is preparing and it's not so much preparing as far as putting together notes and even knowing what you're going to preach more than anything it's keeping yourself in the right atmosphere you got to constantly keep your fed on the right atmosphere because as you're traveling through airports and traveling in Planes everything around you is the wrong atmosphere every picture on every screen every advertisement amen and so you just have to constantly feed your soul and stay in the right channel so it's always nice to have a brother along because when we had long layovers and downtime brother Jonathan and I we just Fellowship on the word constantly non-stop the whole time and it keeps that right atmosphere going all the time so I really appreciated that it was really nice so we went to two different churches in Poland we were at brother yatzik's for special weekend meetings which had three services a Saturday and two on Sunday and then we traveled over to a brother Robert Fisher and we had a service on a midweek a Tuesday night service and then we traveled to Romania for the Family Camp and uh it was near a little uh well near a city called sabiu right in the central part of Romania and so this is brother yatzik and his wife amen we had a nice time with them this is the third time I've been to their place and it's it's become quite comfortable it's quite uh familiar now and so I always enjoy seeing them and they're always treat us so well this is Brother yatzik's house this is from the garden amen the reason you're finally seeing his house and seeing his garden is because Jonathan went I am horrible at taking pictures and I should do better I tell myself every trip I'm going to do better but then I knew Jonathan was taking him so I was worse than ever I mean this is like the worst ever I don't even like to take pictures I don't even enjoy taking pictures but he got some really nice pictures and I was really thankful for him this this house is a testimony for brother yatzik and he told me before but he refreshed my memory on this trip this is the house brother yasick was born in he was born in this house he lived in this house all of his life but as a young man when he accepted the Lord they were raised Lutheran when he accepted the Lord he began to he was really converted he became a Christian accepted Lord and he was praying all the time and witnessing and going out into the woods and praying and it became a shame for his parents and his father he went out to pray one night every evening he would go to the woods and pray and this time he went to the woods and pray to pray and as he was leaving his father said uh where are you going he said I'm going to pray and he says if you go out to pray don't come back you're not welcome here anymore and he said I have to pray he went out to pray and he prayed in the night and when he come back all the doors were locked and he was kicked out of his house and he spent that night sleeping outside on the concrete from there he just started wondering amen different people take him in eventually you know he got married he had his own home and had all of that and many years later and his parents invited him back and told him they would give him this house the Lord had changed their heart turn their hearts towards him and now the house he was chased from the house he was kicked out of is his house the house he was born in is his house amen the bottom level is a separate apartment that's where his parents lived when they were older and now his son lives there with his wife and their two children and so the house is quite a testimony quite a blessing when he shares What the Lord Has Done amen if we lose anything we've really lost nothing well we lose for the gospel God will repay amen we don't have to worry God keeps really good records he said no one has forsaken house or homes or lands or father or mother or wives or children for my sake that he won't restore in this life and in the world to come and the life to come so we see that in the lives of many Saints but the other and his wife they keep quite a nice garden and so their Garden he's explained to me is blueberry plants how he plants them and how he raises them and boy it was blueberry season so we had a good time we picked them and ate them and talked and fell as shipped it was nice so I think we arrived on Friday Saturday evening began the services this is the the front of brother yatzik's Church there amen and they have quite a nice place this church is quite a testimony also it used to be a disco club Praise of God now the dance floor is filled with Believers praising the Lord and worshiping I think that's a good transition to make amen so we'll see here we'll just get a portion of their worship service here [Applause] yeah foreign [Applause] Amen brother Samuel was such a good translator I enjoy working with him and and I got comfortable with him by my side over the times that we traveled and even when we traveled to the other Church in Poland he came along and he translated there and he's fantastic he gets into the same frame of mind he can follow the thought and just keeps everything running so smooth so here's from the side you can see going to the back uh the church it's not very big but they just recently remodeled it they did an excellent job during covert they remodeled it all they've got some side overflow space they really packed the place out I think they can hold 120 130 something maybe in the sanctuary and I think they had upwards of close to 200 people for the meeting so they were packed out they had people up in the Loft which is their Fellowship Hall down in the basement which is a Sunday school room and so they had people everywhere watching on monitors and so people had come from all over and I ran into a very familiar face here this is Brother jury and his wife brother Benjamin will remember Brother jury we stayed in their house and and he's a pastor from Hungary the group from Hungary a group of Believers come from Hungary came over for the services and brother Ben they say hello God bless you they send greetings so we had a we had a wonderful time with them it was so I didn't expect to see him there so I was like so excited when I saw him because we made such a connection with them when we were in Hungary back several years ago I think it was back in 2019 four years ago and that was a special trip and I have a special testimony from that trip I'd like to share uh tonight but it was really good to see them then there was somebody else that was very special that we ran into a sister zabila sister zabila and her friend from Germany they came in for the meetings and so it was really nice to see her in the congregation there smiling I told her I said I wish I could get a cardboard cut out of that smiling face and take it everywhere I go so you just smile at me and make me feel good it was nice so it was good to have her there and then we were able to visit didn't have a lot of time to visit with her so I missed out on that but we had a little bit of time she's doing well and looking forward to her visit here in September so she'll be joining us for the retreat so that'll be nice so we had a service on Saturday two on Sunday then Sunday evening we went out to Fellowship to dinner with some of the ministers and their wives from the church there and there's a there's a like a lot it's like a lodge on top of the mountain and it's all traditional traditional wood and they serve traditional Polish food brother illy and I were there when we were there last year for Easter and it was wonderful and the food is just as good brother Italia I ate your portion I I eat till I spoiled and I ate extra for brother ellia because I knew he'd want me to but we had a really nice Fellowship uh his brother yatzik and and his wife and then brother Joel Missouri that's brother Nathan who visited here with brother yatzik twice that's his brother he's a minister there in the church next to him is brother Daniel Missouri he's an evangelist that's worked out of church for years and I'm hoping that he can come sometime he's a wonderful brother next to him is uh brother Tom he's another young Minister and then you have myself and brother Jonathan and then Samuel and his wife Esther and another sister there it's been a nice Fellowship after the service then Monday we went to Brother Roman and Czech Republic we went over to the Czech Republic side which is only like a 15 minute 20 minute drive and there's a family of Believers the Missouri family this is Nathan's parents place remember Roman's been a deacon in the church since the church started so him and brother yatzik have worked together from the beginning the year 2000 and um and we had a wonderful Fellowship so I just we had a video that they sent me in the fellowship I just want to show it to you because this is is what I love I told the I told him everywhere I go I never travel to preach I only travel for Fellowship I realized on this trip I've realized it before but it hit me with impact again what a privilege it is to go meet brothers and sisters on the other side of the world to travel long distances to go to another culture with another language with another a whole nother set of of circumstances and find the Same Spirit the same desire for the word the same connection the same love the same it's just absolutely amazing and I on this trip I realized that I'm an extremely privileged person because not everybody gets this chance it's rare it's few and and I never want to take it for granted and that's why I want to I want to come and show you this this video I'm getting ready to show you the fellowship around their their table and around their little living room area there and and I I want to share that experience with you because maybe you all won't get to travel to the other side of the world and and visit our brothers and sisters there but I want to tell you amen it's it's beautiful it's wonderful it's the same thing we have here only there and you realize the bride is worldwide the body is all over the globe and it's the same the same love for the world that were the same connection to our Lord the same desires and the same the same sweet Gentle Spirit remember when brother Branham he would be having a prayer line and somebody would be the one in the prayer line and they would step forward and brother Brandon would say now don't be afraid that's him and he says don't you feel that real sweet Gentle Spirit amen I can tell you I felt it in fellowship with my brothers and sisters it's wonderful amen amen and I pray that if you ever get the chance that that if God ever opens the door and gives you the chance that you take the opportunity because I you know I've traveled a lot now I've been in a lot of different countries in a lot of different places and you know it's funny because when you walk through the airport after you visit a place like for the Philippines for instance you walk to the airport and you see these postcards with these beautiful white beaches in a turquoise colored water and palm trees and and I have never seen that in the Philippines because I don't go to see that I go to see the Believers and usually I see a believer's house or a hotel room in a church and a car and I go from a car to a hotel room from a hotel room to a believer's house to a car to a church right brother Kyle no turquoise blues water white sandy beaches and palm trees and hammocks that's not for us but when you've seen the Believers in every country you've seen the most beautiful thing in that country but remember said the beauty of the church is the character of the people I want to say the most precious beautiful thing in every nation in the world is the saints of God [Music] and when you've seen that you've seen the best that a nation has to offer there's no point in seeing anything else you've seen you've been to the top there's nothing else but going down amen so I want to show you this Fellowship [Music] say [Music] s [Music] the lion guard is he said [Music] [Applause] [Music] our voices [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] everything foreign [Music] I travel 24 hours to sit in that living room and share the testimonies that we share talk about the word and sing like that that come at the end of the meetings the day after the meetings were over you talk about restoring whatever was put out was being restored right there and I thank God if you ever get the opportunity take the opportunity and go visit our brothers and sisters wherever you can find them so that was Monday we went over enjoyed that Fellowship Tuesday we traveled to the other Church in Poland this is brother Robert Fisher he's the pastor there he's actually a brother who's traveled to the United States quite a few times we just never had the opportunity to meet so I'm hoping to get to see him again sometime we had a really nice service there Tuesday evening and then we got done late that evening drove over to Krakow stayed in the hotel at the airport and then we got up Wednesday and flew to Romania everything was difficult the flights we had three flights over two flights to Romania coming back two flights to get to Krakow then stay the night coming back we had three flights so we'd float brother Jonathan and I have flown 10 separate flights to get there and back and that's rough that's all I can say is I'm tired of airplanes and I hate the seats in those things praise God it was worth it for the fellowship when we got to the camp the campground actually will only accommodate 150 people so there's a little Valley it's a mountainous area and there's a little Valley that runs through this mountainous region and it's like a kind of a vacation area in the mountains so there's a lot of what would be like airbnbs rental homes through there so the Believers fill the valley by renting all the houses so it's a valley full of Believers by the time this Camp rolls around and this was the house brother Gabrielle matanye brother Gabrielle is the one who invited us there brother Gabriel if you remember he was here last year with his wife he preached here for us one service and we know him from traveling to Romania about six years ago I was there and preached the camp for him six years ago I believe it was and so brother Gabriel rented this and we stayed here with a few other brothers and had a nice fellowship and this was like oh I don't know just a few hundred yards down the road from the camp so it worked out good we got a picture here of the mountains you can see this is from the garden area looking up to the mountains so everywhere you looked was like this it was a beautiful area as brother Jonathan told you it was 95 to 100 degrees there the week before we showed up the projected temperature was I looked at it a week out and it was hot and I was saying oh Lord help us as as outside meetings you know it gets hot and Under the Tent it just bakes and I just don't know I I don't sweat I melt and I figured I'd just be a puddle of Nothing by the time it was over but as Jonathan said the storm came in it cooled everything off and it stayed nice and cool the whole time and it was a blessing for all the Believers so at this meeting we had another speaker was I've shared the meetings with brother Andreas bogg from Switzerland and this brother is a fantastic brother I'd heard good things about brother Andreas and from different different brothers that I know in Europe and even here in the United States talked about what a nice brother he was what a good Ministry he had but I never had a chance to meet him I don't even think I knew even what he looked like I don't think and when I met him we got the chance to fellowship and I really really enjoyed this brother he took three of the services there and then did a a youth meeting and every service he preached I enjoyed I was on the edge of my seat I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the word and the gift that's in our brother and so I'm just praying that he gets to come here sometime and and Minister because I found another good friend in the ministry and he was a real blessing to visit with him you can see here the tent that that we had uh this tent they ordered I think I don't remember I forgot the dimensions but it was a pretty big pretty sizable tent they originally ordered 400 chairs I believe it was 350 or 400 chairs uh the first night the crowd started to fill it all up and they knew more would come in as we got to the weekend so they ended up ordering more chairs they ended up having 450 chairs then they they ended up they couldn't get any more chairs so they got benches and chairs from all over the campground and brought them I think they had really close I think it was pretty close to 550 people that ended up showing up so it surpassed their expectations and it was quite a well-attended camp ended up like brother Jonathan was saying we had Believers from Romania Hungary Serbia Ukraine Poland Czech Republic Italy Spain Moldova UK Germany and I don't know where else there could have been others so it was quite interesting to go around and meet all the brothers and find out where they were from it was quite interesting I'm gonna play a little clip of the song service [Music] everything amen this is Brother Andreas and this is Brother Gabrielle matanye you may remember him after you see the picture of him being here he translated for all the services for brother Andreas and then he and his family and his church they're the ones who organized the camp and it was quite an undertaking he's got a son Reuben and Reuben was like what we say the camp director he had a lot of people helping him but he was a very very busy man but he did a fantastic job so we appreciate him and like I said this is one of the services I enjoy I enjoyed so much sitting and feeding on the word I enjoyed so much listening to the brother preach and a brother with a Clear Vision on the word and and that fresh take you know I always love that fresh because it's outside my own head outside my own understanding and he got a good vision for the word and so I really really enjoyed it and fed from it and we had a nice time and this is uh The Interpreter who interpreted for me this is brother raiol raiol was a fantastic translator he did the Translating for me and here we are preparing for a service they're all in singing we're out sitting in front of a little cabin on a little wooden picnic table and this is what I got into the routine of always doing this with my translators because the the translator he's got to uh he's got a difficult task he's got to take what you're saying and communicate it to the people in their language and you would think all you would have to do is just repeat after me but the problem is he's got to carry the thought not just repeat after me because if he doesn't know where you're going he could be thinking you're going one way with where you're preaching because you know sometimes when we preach we go around the Cow Shed you know that old saying to get to our point and he doesn't know the journey you're on if he doesn't know the destination then he's not going around the Cow Shed he's off to a whole nother path you know so I would always sit down and go through the scriptures with me because I found so many unusual translations of the Bible and other languages some languages are do a very good job some languages are just strange so we'll go through and make sure what I'm reading matches what they'll be reading in their Bible so we do all of that and then I start telling what my inspiration is and I go through a few of my quotes and I want to tell them what my thought is what my main inspiration is what I'm hoping uh the message I'm hoping to convey to the people through the preaching so he knows the desire amen and whenever you preach there's always new things that come fresh scriptures you never thought of fresh quotes that you don't have and there's always fresh stuff but if this brother knows what my inspiration is he knows my desire and he knows my main thought he can stay with me wherever we go and I found that this works out so well and and brother rail was able to catch it I mean when I would be able to just when we were sitting here at the table he would be going amen amen amen he was getting in the thought he was getting in the inspiration and then when we go to the platform we just it works seamless it works so well and he did a fantastic job and I really appreciated the brother you can see him in action here yes [Music] praise God amen I've had people say before the Chad why don't you preach like that at home this is why I say why don't you pull like that so it's a fair statement you know we can it works on both sides but when you realize that this is a camp meeting this is individuals coming from all over and coming to quiet and for Europe there's quite a large Gathering to gather that many Believers and there's anticipation there's enthusiasm there's excitement they they've they've really worked to get there they've spent their money spent their time they've driven from all over and there's quite an atmosphere and so you realize I want you to see that clip so you realize one thing amen it's not the ability of the preacher it's the atmosphere amen a good atmosphere can make a mediocre preacher fly amen I know because I'm a mediocre preacher but you know what I mean it's it's the atmosphere the anticipation brother Benham said the people are 50 of the gift you know the gift is there and so it's it's we've all been in meetings like that where it's just it's just energy there's an anticipation there's an excitement amen and and then you get what you expect but remember said and so it's always exciting it's always a thrill and and the people here were so hungry so desires of the word so respectful for the word pulling and it was so wonderful I enjoyed the atmosphere it was good and I really loved being with them as brother Jonathan said there were several baptisms and here's one sister who uh got baptized praise God it was exciting everybody was rejoicing at the baptisms this is us here I think the the last day brother well rayol and I myself and uh they had us they asked me to pray for this family you can't see but there's a sister on the other side of his brother it's his wife and their little baby this man grew up as a believer but he had left he had left a message he had backslidden and he he married a sister he married or not a sister he married a woman and he married a Catholic woman and they were married in a Catholic Church in they came to the camp and one of those who was baptized was his wife amen she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I think it was on Friday and on Saturday they wanted to dedicate their lives to the Lord and dedicate their son to the Lord and as a family they want to be dedicated to the Lord and so they asked us to pray with them and that was a tremendous pleasure you see somebody go a long way around but they come right to the destination God had for them and if if God if this if for whatever if his brother had a block God opened the door through his wife amen and he followed he he he didn't resist he surrendered his life to the Lord and it was a privilege to pray with them to see it God do a work of restoration man I've got one more clip I want to play this is Saturday night Saturday night at the uh end of the preaching uh brother Andreas preached the evening Services I did the morning Services brother Andreas preached and it was a wonderful service it was tremendous wonderful atmosphere and and we prayed for a few people a few people came forward to be prayed for and then the Brethren just sang and sang and saying they wouldn't dismiss they just kept singing and in a Romanian style they have their own style and I enjoyed it they were rejoicing they were happy and I enjoyed it I just wanted to play a short clip for you thank you [Music] [Music] praise the Lord that was happy I have no idea what they were saying but my heart was saying praise God praise God praise God I don't know what the words were but it caused me to praise God and rejoice and it was quite a blessing and so that that was a fantastic uh group of Believers fantastic environment and it was just a privilege to be with them it's a privilege to shake their hand privilege to hug their neck a privilege to to see them you know we were all at one time together in the mind of God we're all attributes of God together and we had Fellowship together amen because remember God's thoughts are literal they are real they're not like our thoughts and we can't even comprehend that I don't even when I say that I don't even know what I'm talking about but something in me knows that we had Fellowship there amen because there's such a reconnection like a magnetism when you meet in this life and that's what it was with the Brethren there so the Services there ended Sunday as brother Jonathan said we had quite a bit Saturday was a was a full day absolute full day I felt like I was in the Pulpit all day long but God gave us Supernatural strength it was just and it just flowed and I just thank God for it I had about one minute 30 seconds notice that I was going to preach to the ministers I don't know one minute and 30 seconds is not enough time to figure out what you're going to preach just in case you didn't know so it was just can you speak I thought we were doing questions and answers they told me all along we were going to do questions and answers so I was prepared to do questions and answers when I thought it was odd because I was supposed to get the questions ahead of time but I didn't get any questions for questions and answers then all of a sudden the brother Gabriel said we'd like for you just to share to speak with the ministers so I I did I just walked through the pulpit no song service no nothing and and you have to remember 10 minutes earlier I just finished an hour over an hour service for the married couples and just an hour before that before lunch I just finished a two-hour sermon so we'd preached the morning service took a lunch break come back and preached over an hour to the couples I never left the tent I went and sat down 10 minutes later they had the couples out the ministers in and they says can you speak and I just but praise God whenever you need God God's there you couldn't make that happen you can't plan these things you can't just expect to have no plan and God show up on the scene because that's you know just to say oh I'm just going to wing and I'm not going to play anything we're going to have a meeting that's foolishness but when something just happens like that and you have to depend on God you find out God's always there God's always there sometimes it's spiritual laziness to say well I'm not gonna pray anything I'm just going to go and see what happens that's not what we're called to know but when something happens and you have no control I found God always faithful always faithful always on the scene and you find that you do the best you can but when it comes down to it it's God you you should study a minister should study he should seek the Lord he should have an inspiration he shouldn't know that what he's preaching is in the word you should take the time to seek it out but when you can't God's still there amen whichever way it works God's always there and you find the leading of the Lord is so interesting it's never what people think it's never what I think it's always and you look back and you say that was the leading of the Lord but while it's happening you just don't know I mean you feel to go away a certain way you feel to do a certain thing and you just trust that's the best is the best I know how I didn't have a dream I didn't have lightning bolts from Heaven I didn't I just feel like this is what I should do amen and and you know that it could be you it could be God you there's no way for you to know when you don't know until it's over and you look back and God's confirmed it and that was God praise God I love it amen I love preparation I love a plan I love a plan with details I like stuff to start at the minute that's me but oh how God likes to test me so he sends me places where people have a totally different idea of how things should go where time is blending into eternity already but praise God I find that if I can just relax God's always on the scene and he doesn't he doesn't need any of our own thinking it just needs a vessel that he can use that would be surrendered and so God was so good to us there and he helped us all along the way we didn't I guess we ministered for a while I don't know how long maybe 30 40 minutes just sharing from our heart to the ministers and then we did a little over an hour questions and answers and it was no preparation it was no read this question think about it pray find the answer they would just stand up and ask a question sometimes they would stand up and ask a question and I mean it was a Zinger I mean it was a and I would just laugh because what in the world am I supposed to do now and and you know I just smile and I put my head down and and all I could say was wow yeah and then all of a sudden quotes would come scriptures would come and I would remember things that I had read and so God was just on the scene and I just thank God for him and we just pray by the grace of God that whatever we did there was helpful because we never go to hurt when Our intention is never to hurt or to confuse our greatest desires to help God's people greatest desire to do something to encourage do something to bless do something to lift somebody just a little bit higher and do whatever we can whatever our part is and so we pray by the grace of God we were able to do something that would be helpful so we um we got done on Sunday Monday morning we got up to drive we were catching afternoon flights so we drove back to Cebu packed up had breakfast drove and we had about two hours just to walk around the town it was a neat old town and we walked around but they have all these old churches there they have the Catholic Church they have the Orthodox Church they have the Lutheran Church and they're massive old beautiful structures so I put a couple pictures in here this is the inside of the Catholic Church it's unbelievable the Catholic church is different here in the United States than it is in Europe much much different I mean the amount of gold I mean the it's unbelievable I walked through this church and then brother Jonathan and I went to the Lutheran Church and all these churches are trying to outdo each other with their buildings you know now the Protestants have to build one bigger and their steeple has to be higher than the steeple you can just see it and I thought God take me back to that tent on a campground with a grass floor that's the Church of the Living God not the big fancy building these buildings are cold and they're dead amen but where was life life was with 500 and some people packed into a campground into a into an old tent with a grass floor and whatever chairs they could find worshiping the Lord I said that's where I want to be that's where God's children are in the we can go ahead and turn that off I just wanted to share some scriptures with you but I want to share a couple testimonies there was a very very uh wonderful testimony for me personally it was a blessing to me it blessed me in an unmeasurable ways and when I share it with you you'll understand why I hope the last day Sunday as we were wrapping up and leaving there was a young man that came to me he's probably in his early 30s and he said brother Chad I just wanted to thank you and he shook my hand and this testimony starts all the way back when brother Ben and I went brother vincible and I traveled to Serbia back I believe it was 2019 I believe was the years either 2018 or 2019. and this brother comes up to me to shake my hand and say God bless you and he says you probably don't remember me but I'm brother Yanko Thomas's brother and I didn't remember seeing the brother I didn't remember knowing him he says years ago you were in Serbia and he says do you remember when we had the meetings in Serbia and his brother brother Yanko Thomas he organized the meetings and if you all remember do you remember the trip that brother Ben and I took when there was a young man on the plane that had um he he I don't know what you call it he had like an anxiety attack and it looked like it was drug-induced and he really went out of his mind and he got aggressive and the the Marshalls on the plane had to come and Tackle him the plain clothes dressed people on international flights that was the first time I saw there are those Among Us on a plane with authority they they talked with him they got him down they zip tied his hands and we we were rerouted back through Detroit our plane had already taken off we were going to cross the ocean they rerouted us to Detroit they had to change all of our flight we had to spend the night in Detroit then we had to reroute through Paris which we weren't supposed to go through Paris then we couldn't catch the plane in time in Paris so we had to spend the night in Paris so on the way there we spent the night we weren't supposed to spend any nights anywhere we're supposed to fly there and get there a day before the meetings but because this guy had this episode the police had to escort him off we landed the police come and got him escorted him off and everybody on the plane is mad because now they're gonna they're gonna disembark the plane we all had to get off the plane and and all two 250 300 people had to change all of their plans because of this man and everybody was mad and everybody was upset and it was extremely difficult for brother Ben and I it is extremely difficult for me because I knew I was going to be late for the meetings and I had to preach the opening service on whatever night this was and with my nature you just don't mess with my schedule you know I have to be there this isn't right and so so we got rerouted got there we got there a day late to the meetings there were special meetings for three days got there a day late I ended up preaching a day after I was supposed to preach ended up starting the meetings then well here we are four years later and this young man comes to me said do you remember that when you had all that trouble you and brother Ben I said yeah he said I want you to know that was for me said I couldn't get there the first day I had to work I couldn't get there and he said the message you preached touched my life in a special way I was baxton and I had left the message and I came back to the Lord in that service he said if you had preached what you preached the day before I wouldn't be standing here today for four years we had no idea why it was just an interesting story to tell people but now you realize what God will go through for one soul what God will do I mean brother Ben and I weren't mad we took it in stride but I don't think we were happy either but I mean were we it was difficult it was trouble Summit it made me more nervous it backed up our plans it made difficulty for the Brethren and Serbia all these 300 people who had to change their plans who knows what they were going for business going for pleasure going for whatever how many plans were ruined we had to pay for two extra nights in a hotel because this man had to be there when this certain word would come forth so the two could connect and he could give his heart back to the Lord when that brother told me that it just took the breath out of me and I realized how wonderful God is and are the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and I said God forgive me for every time I've ever complained for anything in my life complain for being late in traffic complained for being stopped for standing in a line for anything God forgive me help me never to complain again because God has our lives ordered and he knows what he's doing that testimony just it did something for me and I found I found whatever we pray for we commit ourselves to the Lord we pray that God will direct our steps we pray for all of this and after we pray for that everything in the world goes wrong and the question is does it go wrong or does it go right is wrong right sometimes wrong is right and if we've committed our life to the Lord and asked him the the to guide us and to lead us in the in the in the watch over our footsteps and I believe he will and and this has helped to increase my faith in that I've seen him do it so many times so many testimonies like that but this one had a huge profound impact and I couldn't wait to get back and tell y'all especially brother Ben because he suffered with me through all of that you know there was another testimony from the camp there there was a brother named brother Gregory he was he's a Romanian brother but he lives in uh Germany now he goes to brother Wall's church and he was at the meetings and we had seen him the whole time we were in Romania and the brother was walking with a crutch he had one of those crutches that has the arm cuff with the handle and he had one of those crutches and he was going around just on one side and he was favoring one side and he had his obvious there was something wrong and he had used the crutch up and down steps and as he walked and we saw him for like three days with that crutch through the meetings and then even we had a fellowship after the Sunday meeting in the evening and he was there and then Monday morning he came because he was going to be one of the drivers to help get us to the city and I noticed he didn't have the crotch and I didn't think anything of it I didn't I couldn't speak with him because he spoke only Romanian and German and so I just noticed he didn't have it so we were getting ready to leave and we were going to Bow our heads and pray before we went in the cars to go to Cebu and he said I'd like to share a testimony so he's sharing it through brother matanya he's translating for us and he says I was walking with a crutch I had a lot of pain in my leg and there was something wrong and I don't remember what the problem was I can't remember now but he had a problem with his leg had pain in his leg and he said I woke up this morning and I was talking to God and I told God how much I appreciated the word and respected the word that he preached and I received it as from the Lord that I all the word that was preached during the camp he said I received it as from the Lord and I believe it was from you Lord and he was appreciating God for the word he had and he was surrendering to what he heard and he says when I stood up he said the pain was gone in my leg everything's here amen [Applause] and then while he was talking he was speaking in Romanian so I didn't know what he was saying but I was getting the point because he was pointing down and he was stomping the injured foot on the ground so I got the point he feels good and I was I was thinking about uh I was just meditating on that what did this brother do to get healing what he did is he did the same thing anybody does to get healing what do we do to get healing we reverence the word even if you have hands laid on you that's referencing the word even if you have anointing well that's referencing the word even if you claim it by faith you're still reverencing the word because our healing comes by our faith in the word and so what did this man do he wasn't asking God to heal his leg he was telling God that he received the word that was preached during the meeting and he surrendered to it and believed it was from the Lord what'd he do he respected Christ he respected the anointed word he expected the pre-respected the preaching of the word and while he just was showing honor to God and respect for the preaching God healed his leg and I didn't pull up the quote I wish I would have now but brother Brennan makes a quote where he talks about he's looking forward to the time that people will receive their healing in their seat during the preaching of the word oh praise God I believe we live in that day where we can honor and reverence the word of God and the word will take care of everything let's turn together to Psalms 107 and I would like to read a scripture together Psalms 107 I just want to share a couple thoughts for about 10 minutes as we close Psalms 107 verse 19. Psalms 107 verse 19 then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distress he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions how did he heal how did he deliver he sent his word what has he sent us in this day his word how will he heal how will he deliver he has sent his word amen when we talk about the word we're not talking about a repeating of of words that you can read by having literacy we're talking about a person we're talking about God the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen the the revealed word for the hour is Jesus Christ the anointed word it is God it is Christ it is our bridegroom it is our husband we're not talking about words on paper we're not talking about words that men speak from their own thoughts I mean we're not talking about that we are talking about a realm so much higher than that when we're talking about the word we're talking about God because the word was with God and the Word was God God in the word is the same thing and the anointed word is Jesus Christ he is the word and so now giving reverence to that I don't think we can reference it enough and this man this Gregory he never was anointed with all hands weren't laid up and there's nothing wrong with that that's all still the word that's all fine but just his respect and honor and reverence and submission to the word that he had heard preached during the camp what what really blessed me with this testimony the testimony itself blessed me but what really blessed me is before the service has started I was praying and I said God I pray that you would vindicate the ministry of the word to the people so that they know these things are true you know in doing in doing that I never called for a manifestation never called for a prayer line never I just asked God to vindicate his word so that people would know and without any of those things God did exactly what I asked him to do he Vindicated his word he Vindicated his word he proved that the preaching of the Gospel is still his way that he still is using ministers who he can use to preach the word and anoint them with the Holy Ghost and the anointed preaching is still God's way and I was so very and that was I didn't have any that wasn't my expectation like to hear the brother's testimony I wasn't expecting it I didn't know what God would do I just wanted God to let the people know that this word is true amen that's what I wanted and God did that there was a few people who came up Saturday evening for prayer brother Gabrielle matanya he opened up if anybody would like special prayer special needs for special prayer and there was a couple dozen who came one by one and it was different ministers praying but Gabrielle was praying brother Andreas and myself were praying for different ones who would come and there was one man who came and he was praying for healing for a friend he was standing in for a friend who had some injury to a leg or or something like that and and the next day Monday we were going to leave brother Gabrielle told me he says I got a text message he said that man wanted to let me know his friend is healed said praise God it was so simple I mean it was really so simple it wasn't anything that was really Dynamic it wasn't a super Dynamic prayer it wasn't anything it was really just really simple just power heads together and we'll pray and that was it but God honored his word because they were honoring God's word the honor went back and forth people were receiving God's word and honoring God and God was honoring those who honored him I thought it was beautiful and it blessed me and I started thinking about this and this is just a couple of quotes that I want to share thinking about how privileged we are that God you know the word has been delivered to us and under the preaching of the word God is giving of himself every time he's giving of himself when you listen to that tape God's giving of himself when you listen to the prophet when you come to the church and you come to the preaching of the word God's giving of himself and our attitude towards that means everything that means everything if we recognize what this is you know we're not going to hear a certain brother preach that's not what we're going for if we're going for that we need to change our thinking a little bit and Fly Above the carnal and move out of that I I am going to hear from God I'm going to receive something from God and God has a way to do that he has many ways to do that but one of the ways God does that is through the fivefold ministry he takes a vessel clay vessel pot that's just as no different than anybody else but there's one that he's chosen he's put a gift in and he's going to use that as a channel my inspiration he's going to channel himself out to the people and now you're not receiving the words of a man now when we sit in our seats and receive the word and say Amen to the word we're receiving God we're receiving God we're receiving uh uh he's he's giving us another portion of himself he's unveiling himself to us in a in another way in another form and and our attitudes towards that means the world Amen brother Gregory had the right attitude towards the preaching of the word and he was healed man praise God it really just has done something for me I looked into this message look from 1963 brother Ben said there's nothing like music you know God heals by music did you know that God heals by music God heals by love got healed by medicine God heals by prayer God has many ways of healing depends on what type that you need sometimes a little love stretched out will just cure an old sore an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal it right over Just a Little Love a Little care and the message he cares do you care he says and we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals by understanding by understanding that's a gift revelation God heals by love a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them God heals by love God heals by prayer God heals by Miracles God heals by his word God heals whatever Source it is God heals by it it's God that heals for he said I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases I started thinking about the simplicity of coming to church coming to church just coming to church in our attitude towards that means everything the way we come the our approach to it our our the the the way we approach it and our attitude towards the Simplicity of coming to church on a Sunday and Wednesday will determine what we get out of the service and what we leave with and during the service now brother Brandon makes this statement he said God heals by understanding you can look at it two different ways by understanding one another in love or by understanding the word God heals my understanding God heals by love God heals by prayer God heals by the word he says doctors God heals by music God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals but if you look at all the things that God says he heals by let's start to think of how many you find in a church service and coming together according to the word of forsaking not the assembling of ourselves together you have love because of the fellowship when we greet each other after church when we turn and shake each other's hand when we greet them coming in and going out that's an expression of love God heals by prayer God heals by the word God heals by music this the simple Act of coming to church without even asking to be healed or asking to be prayed for just coming to church is a source of healing amen how many of you ever felt a little under the weather and kind of crummy and were sick or injured and didn't really feel like coming to church but you came to church anyways and how many went home feeling fine raise your hand what was that it wasn't your lucky day amen because just honoring God honoring word he's providing just in a simple church service he's providing so many things that the prophet said we're healed by by music by Prayer by a good Atmosphere by the word by love oh if we had the right attitude towards that and the right attitude towards each other how much more could we get out of the simple Obedience of just coming to church amen Hebrews 10 24 says and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching part of the Apostle Paul tells us he tells us to symbol ourselves together brother Bram takes this and tells us from the same scripture he tells us go to church everybody needs a home Church where they Fellowship together everybody needs a church and then you got to ask yourselves why did why did Apostle Paul give this commandment why did God give us the Commandment why the the prophet encourage us to go to church and have a home church and he said if the Holy Ghost is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open to come in fellowship with your brothers and sisters why now the question was who is church for what is this commandment all about then you realize God doesn't need this I need this this commandment is for me for my benefit for my welfare for my growth for my strength for my healing amen God would not have had the Apostle Paul give us this commandment God doesn't need us to come to church we need to come to church we need Fellowship we need one another we need love we need this is something we need this is for our benefit this is not a the keeping of a law to keep a law this is not a requirement to get into heaven this is God's supplying a need God giving us the best thing he can give us what we need what will benefit us what will bless us and if we come now if we see that this is for us now we come with the right attitude towards what God has asked us to do for our benefit we can get the full benefit out of what God's asked us to do but it all depends on our approach brother Brown said it's your attitude towards your approach towards the Divine working of God will determine what you'll get out of it if you come and say well glory to God stand there and chew your chewing gum and say I'm just going around to see them Holy Rollers is doing I didn't see nothing I never seen them just a bunch of Maniacs look if you come to criticize the devil will give you something to criticize that's easy criticizing is easier if you want to sit in the house of criticism and come to church with that the devil is your best friend and he's on your side and I mean he'll open your eye you talk about Revelation you'll get Revelation if you come with a spirit of criticism the spirit of revelation will strike you and you'll see every fault possible it's amazing it's amazing how clear your vision will be because you'll be anointed of the wrong spirit because that criticizing spirit's not from God in his E I mean criticism is easy but he says if you come to find good God will show you something good it depends on what you're looking for when we come to church what do we come for what was our attitude and Company what was our motive in coming what did we desire in coming you know there's many reasons we come and it's not like we can put this off of this is this person's reason and this is this no we each one have come to church for many different reasons over the years all of us some of us have come out of obligation some of us have come for our family some of us have come so that we can have Fellowship afterwards I mean I should just say me I shouldn't say some of us Through The Years my motive and my desire and my purpose in coming has not always been pure for every service I came to and I realized looking back that I got out of the service what my attitude and expectation was but oh God if I see the potential oh God help me to come with different Vision different expectation help me come realizing that this is Supernatural this is your provided way this is something you you want to give us and it and it's not only the preaching it's the whole package it's the fellowship it's the love it's the worship it's the opportunity to express your love to God through the songs it's the atmosphere the music creates it's the atmosphere of quiet time before coming and praying and quieting ourselves it's the whole package comes together to bring healing and it's not just physical healing we need emotional healing we need mental healing amen we we need we need our past heal from us we need all kinds of healing and we can get it if we come with the right attitude [Music] praise God in Galatians 4 Apostle Paul says in my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despise not he's talking about when his trial his fleshly ailment you despise not nor rejected but recede me as an angel of God even ask Christ Jesus I've read that before but when you really stop and read what Paul's writing it's remarkable he says you received me as an angel of God well I can take that an angel's a messenger and received you as a man you received me as an angel of God okay yeah that makes sense I can go along with that intellectually as a human being but the next statement is going to take a revelation from God not intellectual understanding you receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus they received the Apostle Paul in his ministry as Christ Jesus you were talking about walking a Razor's Edge now we're getting down to the razor's Edge and only the only the elect could walk this by faith because if you make Paul Jesus Christ and the person you've made him Antichrist but if you make you if you make what's working through him in the ministry coming through anything different than Jesus Christ you're wrong so when brother Branham was here amen somebody asked a question of questions answered could you be Jesus Christ or could Jesus Christ look like you or they were kind of him hauling around with the question and brother Benham says now now in one way that's right and in one way that's wrong so to make me the person of Jesus Christ would we make me Antichrist but to say that Christ was in me or using me or something like that now that would be exactly right so now when they receive the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul was not the the full embodiment of Jesus Christ but who was ministering through Paul who was bringing the word who was that amen remember brother Brenham said the five full ministry is the dress where the inner dress wear the under close of of Jesus Christ so what is inside the underclose Jesus Christ who's the veil hiding and remember it's the five-fold ministry that was the undergarment amen the underneath clothes this is what brother Branham tells is the underneath clothes so what does that make the fightful ministry the very closest thing on earth to Jesus Christ because they're touching his skin the underneath clothes so how should we approach the preaching of the word how should we approach our brothers and sisters how should we approach the fellowship well I can take him as an angel of the Lord because angel means messenger can we go by Revelation a step beyond that well I can believe that for Paul because it was written in the Bible see that's all the intellectual side but by Revelation can we go above that and unlock the full potential of obeying the Lord the full potential of the Simplicity of coming to church but coming with the right frame of mind I have not come to hear a man preach I have come to hear Christ Jesus speak through a vessel he chose and placed a gift in before the foundation of the world and I'm trusting that God will operate by the Holy Ghost through that vessel I'm coming to see my brothers and sisters which are not just merely flesh and blood but they're the attributes of God that have been distributed into this world that I had fellowship with before the foundation of the world and when I hugged them I'm not hugging a human being amen I'm embracing an attribute inside of that amen coming back in contact with what I was in contact before the foundation of the world if we can come without the carnal side and go beyond the carnal side and not just you know it's it's 6 p.m eat our dinner in a hurry oh we got church tonight I'm so tired got to put a tie on there some of us put a tie on gotta wash my face I gotta eat my dinner real fast and oh I'm just so tired it'd be nice to have a night off Hey listen I fought those thoughts before but that's the natural side that's the natural life that's the way the natural world is you're tired you've worked the kids are fussing one of them might be having a fever and that's just the excuse it might I've been there I know I don't have to point out what you're doing all I have to do is point out what I've done and if I point what I've done if I point out what I've done I've exposed everybody because we've all lived a natural human life we're all stuck but then all of a sudden if something another sweeping thought can come in on top of all those thoughts and say but God said but God said and I want to honor God and I want to show what's important in my life and I want to come for other reasons not even to get something I just want to go show God that I love him more than I love my rest more than I love my job more than I love anything else that I love God the most if you honor God and your honor his word the word will work and ways we never imagined it's not like one for one God's so much more than that I I came to show God I love him I came to have Fellowship I came to hear the word but God did more than that he healed me he lifted my spirit he healed that stress that it was building up in me and by the time I walk out of the service I'm not stressed anymore the very reason that I was feeling not to come to church is all eliminated by the service by the preaching of the word by the singing by the fellowship and I go home completely different than the way I can I don't know about you but I've had many times in my life I've contemplated you're sitting on the edge should I go or not go I don't really feel good I'm a little bit late I'm feeling rushed go or not go and there have been there I've made I've made decisions on both sides so we'll just get the cat out of the bag I made the decision because I was at that cusp I had to make a decision and I was a little bit tired a little bit worn a little bit this and had just enough excuses to stay home and I stayed home and it was the most miserable night of my life has anybody ever missed church because you were too rushed too tired not feeling good and you stayed home miserable feeling like you missed something and I'm missing something and I should be there and it's too late now and I made the wrong choice I've been there and whenever I get there I said I will never do this again God help me please never to do this again but there are times when we need the other choice say no I'm going anyways and I'm so glad I did so glad I did the sermon is not about church attendance I hope you understand it's about our attitude our approach to God towards the word of God the same thing's true for reading your Bible for praying for reading the message for listen the same thing the right attitude the right approach I had a brother tell me that they were playing a tape in the church every once in a while he likes to play a tape kind of like what we do they do it a little different but he says they were playing that tape in church and there was a sister sitting there that needed to be healed there was something wrong oh I'll tell you a I I hope I get the details right yeah it was a sister yeah a sister with diabetes and when we were in the house of uh the more uh whatever the house where we were all singing and having Fellowship I showed you the video uh the Missouri house when we were sitting in that house one of the daughter-in-laws of one of the sons was telling us a testimony they were in the church and that night they were playing a tape in the church and she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and the brother Branham said you little sister there sitting there with diabetes the Lord stand to your feet in the Lord Heal you she stood up and was instantly healed and never had a problem with diabetes again what was that it was her respect to the word of God her attitude towards that this is this is they're playing a tape this isn't even life preaching but God honored her attitude amen and if God would not let one of Samuel the prophet's words fall to the ground will he let one of brother branhams fall to the ground if you can believe it's for you if you can believe it amen she just she took it without thinking she took it without reasoning she just took it and God honored her respect Amen to the word of God what a testimony I say God if you can do that you can do anything if I can just respect you in your ways brother Bram goes on to say he says your attitude God can send a gift and no matter what it depends on what attitude you take towards it listen the gift whether it's brother branham's gift for healing whether it was the gift of Deliverance or the gift in the Pulpit to preach that gift cannot override your bad attitude no matter how powerful the gift is Jesus Christ himself could not override unbelief because when he went and took Capernaum he could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief even brother Branham as powerful as the gift of healing was within him that gift could not override your bad attitude so he says depends on what attitude you take towards it this is why it's so horrible to criticize Ministry so horrible to criticize brothers and sisters with a gift whether singing or or whatever playing it's a horrible thing to criticize because if God sends a gift we need to re receive it is from God because our attitude towards that depends on whether it will work for us or not it depends on what attitude you take towards it look at them who smote his look at them who smote his face and spit on him and everything was no virtue there they were touching the Lord they laid their hands on him and they got no strength whatsoever from their contact physical contact but a woman that believed it believed it was touched the Hem of His Garment and was healed the soldiers had hand-to-hand contact hand to face contact they were touching his skin she never touched his skin she touched the Hem of His Garment and God honored her reverence and respect and her attitude and she was healed instantly those soldiers got no healing same person same gifts same everything is that right it depends on what you think about it God sends it it's your attitude towards any Divine gift determines what you get out of it that's why you can have two people go to church one person will go with the answer to their question with Deliverance with Direction and the other person said I got nothing out of that I don't even know what he was talking about the real question is not not what the man was preaching the real question sometimes is how did you come through those doors because how you came through those doors is how you went right back out you came expecting an answer you came with reverence you came with respect you came believing you came knowing that this is the place God answers that God uses the ministry God brings his word I'll get my answer you get it praise God you come and say oh this brother's preaching and we go right back out the way we came in sometimes it's not the brother preaching sometimes it's our attitude towards the gift that doesn't mean every brother preaches right and everything that said you know what I mean preachers are humans too they make mistakes they say things wrong that's normal but we have to have the right attitude we have to have the right attitude but everyone says see you see it's your approach to God what brings the results what brings the results the gift no my approach to the gift is what brings the results brother Brennan said to the people he said that's the reason I can help you is because you believe in me if you didn't believe me I couldn't help you so you see how important are approaches I say God give me the right approach I want to have the approach that brother Gregory from Germany had when one day he was that night he was hobbling on a crutch I saw him at night Sunset 10 o'clock at night he's on a crutch the next morning he comes to pick us up when we finish our breakfast no crutch what happened between Sunday night he was expressing his reverence for what was preached and believing it came from God I said God let me have that reverence towards you and toward the things that come from you let me have reverence God let me respect your way and honor your way respect your gifts let me come to church with an expectation let me come with the right attitude let me come knowing this is your method your place your way this is where I belong this is where you've placed me in God and I'm expecting to hear from you I'm expecting to get healed I'm expecting to walk out of here better than when I came there amen let's all stand you can see it's been a good trip for me it's not just a trip I feel like every time I travel and everywhere I go I learn something something opens up on a different level God is always teaching me it's not you know you know the in reality with God it's never just give give give it's always give and receive give and receive and that's been the way it is everywhere I've ever went and some of these testimonies that I heard they just absolutely blessed my soul and they settled something in me and I realized you know what I'm going to have to watch my attitude I'm going to have to check up and make sure that I'm approaching things of God the right way I always want God God you heal me God you deliver me God you do this God you say my family God you do you do you do you do and the question is what am I doing what's my attitude what's my Approach what's my surrender what's my submission sometimes God has already done it you mean brother Ted he's already done it you have a believing Church there's a Ministry that will preach the word we have the message of the hour we have God has already done it It's just sometimes we're out of sequence with what God's already provided the healing's already here the Deliverance is already here if you've got emotional strain the healing's here if you've got a physical need the healing's here if you need direction in your life amen the son of man is still here yeah he's pretty he's already provided God I need this God I need that and God's already provided it in God's provided way we just have to have the right attitude and the right approach towards it and we'll draw out of it everything he's given for us what did he send he sent his word what has he sent this day through through the seventh Angels through the prophet of the eight he sent the word what do you have need of whatever you have need of is in the word this message contains what we need it's our approach to it that'll determine what we get out of it our approach to one another is our approach to the things of God our approach to brothers and sisters is our approach to the things of God our approach with the ministry our approach to brother Branham our approach to the Bible our approach to this is our approach to God Amen I want to hey this is the greatest Revelation that has struck the Earth because it's what's been sealed in the back part of God's mind is now unsealed and available to the children of God by revelation I believe that holds the answers holds the healing holds the delivery I believe it holds everything it'll just take my approach to it amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father God you were so good to brother Jonathan and I you were so good to this assembly in my absence Lord you provided Ministry you provided gifts you provided word you provided an environment you provided everything that we would need God you watched over all of our

submission to your way oh we love you we thank you for providing everything that we need we pray you forgive us for sometimes missing that provision but God I'm encouraged more than ever not to miss what you provided but I want to take full advantage of everything that you have for me I love you father I ask God that you would bless your people Lord I pray that you would bless the Saints abroad
