========================================

I've read that before but when you really stop and read what Paul's writing it's remarkable he says you received me as an angel of God well I can take that an angel's a messenger and received you as a met you received me as an angel of God okay yeah that makes sense I can go along with that intellectually as a human being but the next statement is going to take a revelation from God not intellectual understanding you receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus they received the Apostle Paul in his ministry as Christ Jesus you were talking about walking a Razor's Edge now we're getting down to the razor's Edge and only the only the elect could walk this by faith because if you make Paul Jesus Christ and the person you've made him Antichrist but if you make you if you make what's working through him in the ministry coming through anything different than Jesus Christ you're wrong amen so when brother Branham was here amen somebody asked a question of questions answered could you be Jesus Christ or could Jesus Christ look like you or they were kind of him hauling around with the question and brother Benham says now now in one way that's right and in one way that's wrong said to make me the person of Jesus Christ would we make me Antichrist but to say that Christ was in me or using me or something like that now that would be exactly right so now when they receive the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul was not the the full embodiment of Jesus Christ but who was ministering through Paul who was bringing the word who was that amen remember brother Branham said the fivefold ministry is the dress where the inner dress wear the under close of of Jesus Christ so what is inside the underclose Jesus Christ who's the veil hiding and remember it's the five-fold ministry that was the undergarment amen the underneath closes what brother Branham tells us the underneath close so what does that make the fifo ministry the very closest thing on earth to Jesus Christ because they're touching his skin the underneath clothes so how should we approach the preaching of the word how should we approach our brothers and sisters how should we approach the fellowship well I can take him as an angel of the Lord because angel means messenger can we go by Revelation a step beyond that well I can believe that for Paul because it was written in the Bible see that's all the intellectual side but by Revelation can we go above that and unlock the full potential of obeying the Lord the full potential of the Simplicity of coming to church but coming with the right frame of mind I have not come to hear a man preach I have come to hear Christ Jesus speak through a vessel he chose and placed a gift in before the foundation of the world and I'm trusting that God will operate by the Holy Ghost through that vest
