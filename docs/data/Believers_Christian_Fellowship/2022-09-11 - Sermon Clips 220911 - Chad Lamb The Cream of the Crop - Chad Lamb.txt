TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to all of you growing up all you teenagers and your young adults and your children growing up it's a blessing to grow up in a family that loves god it's a blessing to grow up in an atmosphere that is focused on god and focused on his word it is a tremendous blessing to grow up sheltered from the things of the word world and taught the things of god but if you're not careful you will serve god for the acceptance of the people that you're around to please your parents to please your friends to fit in with the group and to obtain some sort of favor with god and to get something out of god and all of that at the end of the day amen is not going to get you where you want to be it is not accepted by god there's only one way to please god that's when you come to him out of a pure heart because you love him and him alone and regardless of what happens to you in return if everybody around you rejects you your parents kick you out amen all your friends reject you but you serve god because you love him that's the works that he's looking for that's the service that he'll accept amen he's not going to accept you going getting carried downstream where everybody's going and staying in the boundaries amen to be accepted that's not acceptable by god what's accepted by god is when you get real with god and say god i love you i want to love you more something in me has to change change me oh god to where i'm not doing service for people i'm not doing service for the ones i associate with i'm not doing it for a return of marriage i'm doing it based solely because i love you [Music] [Applause] amen and if we can't get to that point we need to dig a little deeper and dig a little deeper until we can get to the point where it says if mom and dad reject me if everybody rejects me if i get shipped off to another country by myself if i go with the same heart that i have now i will love him just the same there and serve him just the same there as i do today i'm not doing it because of the collective atmosphere i'm not doing it because of the collective thought i'm not doing this for acceptance i'm doing it because i love you god that was the blessing that the thyatirans were under their motives were proved by the atmosphere that's why brother brahm could say they were the cream of the crop that's why they could get such an admonition amen from the lord in in revelation chapter 2 because their motives were proved by the circumstances
