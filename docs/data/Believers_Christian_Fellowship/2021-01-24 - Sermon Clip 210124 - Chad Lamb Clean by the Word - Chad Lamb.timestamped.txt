[0:00] but they've proven that those filters
[0:02] don't do anything because people get
[0:03] lung cancer by the droves on filtered
[0:05] cigarettes
[0:06] and the same thing's happening in the
[0:08] church amen worldliness is creeping in
[0:10] and they don't have a heart for god
[0:11] amen and they're falling away because
[0:14] they've taken a church filter the church
[0:16] says and the church says and they teach
[0:18] and
[0:21] trying why why would they want a church
[0:23] filter because they've got a taste for
[0:25] the world amen
[0:27] why would a man knowing that that
[0:29] cigarette's dangerous why would he
[0:30] choose a cigarette with a filter
[0:32] because he wants the taste of the
[0:34] cigarette but he knows it's dangerous he
[0:36] meant so he's trying to find a
[0:37] compromise
[0:38] that'll keep him alive amen and still
[0:41] let him enjoy the thing he's got a taste
[0:43] for and the churches have done the exact
[0:45] same thing
[0:46] and all of them are guilty of it amen
[0:48] they still have a taste for the world
[0:50] and they want to be safe from eternal
[0:52] damnation
[0:54] so they stuck a church filter amen over
[0:56] top the world
[0:57] and they filter it out we don't do
[0:58] r-rated movies we just do pg-13
[1:03] we don't go to rock and roll concerts
[1:04] that we just brought into the church and
[1:06] change the lyrics amen
[1:07] we you see they put out they put a
[1:10] church
[1:11] filter on it because they love the taste
[1:14] of the world
[1:18] god doesn't care how you dress he's only
[1:19] looking at your heart that's
[1:21] partially true he's interested in your
[1:23] heart and when you could dress perfect
[1:25] and have a black heart it doesn't mean
[1:26] anything with god
[1:27] but if you've given your heart to the
[1:29] lord you've given your whole self to the
[1:30] lord
[1:32] and the spirit of god is not a filthy
[1:34] spirit and if the spirit of god lives in
[1:36] you
[1:36] the outside of you will reflect the
[1:38] spirit that's on the inside
[1:40] but a church filter will slap a church
[1:43] creed will slap a church creed and
[1:45] filter
[1:45] they'll explain away the word of god and
[1:47] why do people still drove to churches
[1:50] amen why do they why did churches fill
[1:52] up why do mega churches fill up
[1:54] because people know there's a god and
[1:56] they're afraid of hell
[1:58] [Applause]
[2:02] and so they'll suck through that church
[2:04] filter because they have a taste for the
[2:06] world
[2:09] but god has provided a filter for his
[2:11] children that filter is the word of god
[2:13] and that word of god will not let
[2:15] worldliness through amen
[2:17] it will not let ungodliness through it
[2:19] will not let selfish desire or lust of
[2:21] the flesh or lust of the eye
[2:23] it won't let it through amen the word
[2:25] stops it every time
[2:27] brother bev said the only thing that
[2:29] will get through the word filter
[2:31] is the holy ghost amen and it depends on
[2:33] what you have a taste for and what your
[2:35] desire
[2:36] but if you get a hold of that word and
[2:37] you draw and draw from the word
[2:39] the only thing that's going to come
[2:41] through that revealed word of god
[2:43] is the holy spirit of god amen and if
[2:45] you've got a taste for the spirit of god
[2:47] then you'll draw on the word of god
