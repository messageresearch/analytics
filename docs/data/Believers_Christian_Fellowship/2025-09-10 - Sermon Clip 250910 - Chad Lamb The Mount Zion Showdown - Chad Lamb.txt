========================================

She is his body which is what the manifested truth of the promised word for the last days. And she and she alone stands by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody else believes this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's the only one who stands with the true revelation of the true word. And it's in her only. It's nowhere else. You don't find this revelation anywhere else. This manifestation. Because if you love me, you keep my words. And if you keep my words, what words? All of my word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then my father will love you and we will come into you and make our abode with you in that day. That's this day, friends. &gt;&gt; And she alone stands by it. That's why the devil is howling. And these great organizations set up try to set up something to close her up. They'll never do it. She'll be taken up, not closed up. She is now. Oh my goodness. She is now risen. And by the power of the vindicated word promised her, she is risen. Risen from what? risen from dead denominationalism. Risen from the darkness of obscurity of the word, but she's risen back to what? She's been awakened by the latter reign. Amen. There's been nothing to stir the bride yet. Amen. But now they're crying for revivals. Revival. Revival. Why? Because they they know something's got to happen, but they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride. She has risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her. &gt;&gt; She's now been raised up like Ezekiel's dry bones. She's now come back to what she was supposed to be. And now he's pouring his full word into her. &gt;&gt; And the devil's howling &gt;&gt; about this manifestation of the truth of the promised word in her alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? What was the Mount Carmel showdown? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. the vindicated voice of God against every other voice. &gt;&gt; What was Mount Transfiguration? Hear ye him. One man, the fullness of the word and every other voice silenced. &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? Him and her. The word and her alone. And she's the only one that stands by it. And every other voice is silent. No denomination, no creed, no other teaching. This is the truth of Jesus Christ. This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; That's what they're howling about the revelation in her &gt;&gt; alone. &gt;&gt; Amen.
