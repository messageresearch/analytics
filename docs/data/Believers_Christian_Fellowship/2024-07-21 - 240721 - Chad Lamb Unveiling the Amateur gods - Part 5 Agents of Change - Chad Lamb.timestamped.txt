[25:48] in the hospital and very sick and my
[25:51] wife and I were visiting someone else in
[25:53] the hospital and we looked down at the
[25:54] end of the hall and I saw our
[25:55] granddaughter walking around on the
[25:57] phone so I just went down to say hi and
[25:59] she said Grandma's not doing well so we
[26:02] stepped in and we had a word of prayer
[26:04] together and so it does my heart good to

[26:11] anybody else is visiting may God bless
[26:13] you you're welcome to be here we're very
[26:15] glad to have you and we just want God to
[26:18] be welcome in our midst we want the Lord
[26:20] Jesus to find welcome in this place
[26:23] amen amen let's turn to the Book of
[26:25] Romans together while we're standing
[26:29] I intend to continue on with the thought
[26:31] we've had on unveiling the amateur
[26:34] gods and uh I'd like to take as a
[26:37] subtitle agents of
[26:39] change and um we'll hopefully be able to
[26:44] uh understand why that's on my heart
[26:46] that way and we'll see how that goes
[26:49] also as you're turning there I want to
[26:50] remind you that we do have the
[26:51] fellowship dinner after the service in
[26:53] the fellowship hall today everyone who's
[26:55] here is welcome to come we'd love for
[26:56] all the visitors to join us and have a
[26:58] time of Fellowship together so we're
[27:00] looking forward to that as well if we
[27:03] could turn to Romans 8:1 15 now verse
[27:12] 15 it says for you have not received the
[27:15] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[27:17] have received the spirit of adoption
[27:19] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[27:22] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[27:24] that we are the children of God and if
[27:27] children then HS Heirs of God and Joint
[27:30] HS with Christ if so be that we suffer
[27:33] with him that we may be also glorified
[27:36] together man God bless you as you take
[27:38] your
[27:40] seats so the spirit itself beareth
[27:43] witness with our spirit that we are the
[27:45] children of God we've got a witness in
[27:47] our heart the spirit bearing with our
[27:49] spirit that we are the children of
[27:52] God and if children then were heirs HS
[27:55] of God and Joint HS with Christ that
[27:58] means what inheritance Christ gets we
[28:00] get we're in air with him because we're
[28:03] children of God Amen he is he is called
[28:06] our brother amen because we are children
[28:09] as well we have the same father and so
[28:11] that that puts us in a I would say a
[28:14] very special place and and it's
[28:17] something we don't have to worry or fret
[28:18] about it's a guaranteed position that
[28:21] we'll be we are joint HS with
[28:23] Christ I want to read just two quotes as
[28:26] a review from what we've been looking at
[28:28] and the message as the eagle stirs her
[28:30] nest he says he is messiah messiah is
[28:34] the anointed one and we are his children
[28:36] which have a lesser anointing so as
[28:39] Jehovah Eagle is Great Eagle and we are
[28:41] eaglets he's Messiah and we with the
[28:44] same anointing are Messi amen anointing
[28:47] Messiah means the anointed one are you
[28:49] anointed amen what with the same spirit
[28:52] that he was anointed with we have it in
[28:54] measure he has it without measure he was
[28:57] God manif In the Flesh and we're sons of
[28:59] God parts of him coming on yes sir the
[29:02] very works that I do shall you do also
[29:05] and then he goes to the analogy of a
[29:06] spoonful of water you take the Spoonful
[29:08] out of the ocean and what you have is a
[29:11] portion of the ocean with the same
[29:13] quality as what's in the ocean with a
[29:15] different
[29:17] quantity and he begins to show that the
[29:19] spirit of God that's deposited us and
[29:21] the life of God is deposit in US is a
[29:24] portion Jesus had it in fullness amen
[29:26] but we have a portion and it's not an
[29:29] inferior quality it's a less
[29:32] quantity it's part of God
[29:35] Amen and so then again in the message
[29:38] the Messiah says now that's is true God
[29:41] called Messiah called God called us and
[29:44] we become Kings and Priests unto God
[29:46] Like Jesus was God's high priest we
[29:48] become a lesser priest and that's what
[29:50] we focused on uh this past
[29:52] Wednesday God in fullness dwelt in him
[29:55] to shine forth the expression of God to
[29:57] the world world for God was in Christ
[29:59] reconciling the world to himself and as
[30:01] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[30:03] to himself God comes into his church and
[30:06] anoints him some messes oh my do you see
[30:10] it the same things he did is is in his
[30:13] church the same power he had is in his
[30:15] church and his church becomes his
[30:18] dominion and he's King over the Dominion
[30:20] and we are Kings in Priest offering
[30:23] spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits
[30:25] of our lips giving praise to his name
[30:28] amen oh my there you are messet messet
[30:31] little Messiahs little anointed ones
[30:34] anointed off of what the main one
[30:36] anointed off that great one so now we're
[30:39] looking at our position in God and our
[30:43] true identity and one thing the message
[30:45] did that was so marvelous for me is it
[30:48] took away my false identity the lie that
[30:51] i' had been living on my life and it
[30:52] brought the truth of a true identity
[30:55] because identity amen changes is
[30:58] everything about
[31:00] us you remember how brother B said how
[31:03] important it is to name your child to
[31:05] give your child a good name yes is that
[31:07] right brother B goes in and many times
[31:10] he explains that and we see that God
[31:12] many times will change the name of his
[31:14] children and major events in their life
[31:16] when they're getting when they're
[31:17] meeting God or something in their life
[31:19] is about to change he changes their name
[31:21] because the change of by name changes
[31:24] identification and brother R tells us
[31:26] when you have a a name if you name your
[31:28] child something you've placed an
[31:30] identification on them by that name
[31:32] because that name means something and
[31:34] that meaning begins to identify them and
[31:36] they begin to respond to the name that
[31:38] you call them because an identity is so
[31:42] important amen and so this message came
[31:46] to to to tell us who we really are Amen
[31:49] to tell us that you're a bride amen that
[31:51] you're Messiah that you're Lesser God
[31:53] became it gave us identification and
[31:56] tell us that we came from God and we go
[31:58] back to God Amen and that we're the
[32:00] apple of his eye the love of his life
[32:02] we're the portion of the word that's to
[32:04] be fulfilled in this day what's he doing
[32:06] he's the message is bringing us a true
[32:09] identification because identification
[32:11] has to do with positioning and the
[32:13] positioning has to do with
[32:15] power we're going to get into that as we
[32:18] go so we'll see how important it is to
[32:21] have the right
[32:23] identification we are all born under a
[32:26] lie
[32:30] we grow up we have a birth certificate
[32:33] and we look at the birth certificate and
[32:35] said this is my origin this is my mother
[32:37] this is my father this is my name this
[32:39] is my birthday this is when I began
[32:41] existence this is where I began
[32:42] existence and and and that is all a
[32:46] lie because in reality I began long
[32:49] before I was in the thoughts of God
[32:51] before the foundation of the world Amen
[32:53] so this was just the beginning of an
[32:55] Earthly dispensation for me an Earthly
[32:57] Journey a plan that God had a temporary
[33:00] position that he put me in to accomplish
[33:02] his purpose this birth certificate I
[33:05] have is not my identification it is only
[33:07] a placing where God placed me to do
[33:09] something for his kingdom for a short
[33:11] period of time but this is my birth
[33:13] certificate this is my true
[33:15] identification this is who I really am
[33:18] where I came from and where I'm going
[33:20] amen Because unless I know who I am and
[33:22] what my purpose is I'll constantly be be
[33:25] wasting energy and time chasing the
[33:28] wrong things in
[33:29] life going down the wrong roads trying
[33:32] to accomplish the wrong things putting
[33:34] the wrong emphasis in the wrong places
[33:36] and wasting the time that God's given me
[33:38] amen because I in order for me to do
[33:40] what God's called me to do I need to
[33:42] know who I am and what it is he wants me
[33:44] to do praise
[33:47] God and so when we when we look here at
[33:52] this uh uh title agents of
[33:56] change in the message perseverant
[33:58] brother B said God always works through
[34:00] agents men man is God's agent always not
[34:04] Creed not denomination but man so God
[34:08] brother man said God is on partnership
[34:09] with man he does nothing unless he works
[34:11] through a man man is God's agent upon
[34:14] the Earth and when brother R talks about
[34:16] this he tells us he uses the example of
[34:20] uh Jesus standing one day looking out
[34:22] over the multitudes and he says Behold
[34:24] The Harvest is ripe and the the the
[34:27] field is ripen the Harvest pray to the
[34:29] Lord of the Harvest that he'll send
[34:30] laborers into the Harvest and and
[34:33] brother said he was the lord of the
[34:35] Harvest he was looking at the Harvest he
[34:37] knew the need but yet he's asking them
[34:39] to pray pray at that to the lord of the
[34:42] Harvest so he's saying you pray to me so
[34:45] that all sin labors because because you
[34:47] can see that laborers are needed well
[34:50] Jesus himself could see that laborers
[34:52] were needed but God has set up his
[34:54] program where it doesn't move without
[34:56] you and I he has to have agents on the
[34:58] earth to move
[35:01] things
[35:03] amen there there's
[35:06] uh there's when I looked at this title
[35:09] of I was looking at agents and agents of
[35:11] change I titled that for a reason
[35:13] because my son Blake's last job that he
[35:15] just had before he he took a new
[35:17] position was the change
[35:20] agent I said well what's a change agent
[35:23] you know but it was somebody who when
[35:26] they needed to make changes for
[35:27] Improvement somebody had to be an agent
[35:29] to facilitate that change or to work in
[35:32] it or talk to everybody and bring it
[35:33] about and he was a change agent well
[35:36] well I wonder if our purpose here isn't
[35:38] to make
[35:40] changes amen if we can be agents of
[35:43] change if we're God's agents on the
[35:44] earth and and so God uses man and we
[35:48] understand that and I want to talk about
[35:50] that but there's many things that I've
[35:52] been uh uh looking at meditating on so I
[35:55] just pray you have you bear with me and
[35:57] just pull I'm asking you to you always
[35:59] pull but just for me put in a little
[36:01] extra
[36:02] tug because I've been looking at a few
[36:04] things and for me you know sometimes you
[36:06] look at things and I don't understand
[36:08] how they correlate I can't seem to make
[36:10] them line up amen it's like scattered
[36:12] shot uh for me on paper but I know they
[36:15] go together somehow because God's laid
[36:17] it on my heart and sometimes I just have
[36:19] to come to the pull pit and Trust amen
[36:21] that under the anointing and under the
[36:22] inspiration of the word God will line it
[36:24] up and this morning happens to be one of
[36:26] those days so I pray that you just give
[36:28] a little extra tug on the other side of
[36:30] the Rope for me please you may have to
[36:32] pull me through a little bit amen uh
[36:35] let's turn together to 2 Corinthians
[36:37] chapter
[36:42] 5 2 Corinthians chapter
[36:49] 5 in verse 18 2 Corinthians 5 we'll
[36:54] begin at Verse 18
[36:58] and all things are of God who ha
[37:00] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[37:02] and ha given to us the ministry of
[37:04] reconciliation to it that God was in
[37:06] Christ reconciling the world unto
[37:08] himself not imputing their trespasses
[37:10] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[37:13] word of
[37:14] reconciliation now then we are
[37:17] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[37:20] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[37:22] dead be reconciled to God so God was in
[37:27] Christ reconciling the world and to
[37:28] himself not laying to them the the
[37:31] charge of their transgressions amen but
[37:33] now he's given to us the word of
[37:35] reconciliation so now the work that
[37:38] Christ was doing now falls upon us for
[37:40] we're ambassadors for
[37:42] Christ so an ambassador is an agent yes
[37:46] you can see he he's representing
[37:49] something else in a foreign land and
[37:51] we're here in a foreign land
[37:52] representing Christ amen and we're here
[37:54] as ambassadors for Christ with a word of
[37:56] reconciliation because his ministry was
[37:58] a Reconciliation to God but he's given
[38:01] us the word of reconciliation and now as
[38:03] ambassadors we're carrying on the work
[38:05] of reconciling man back to God that's
[38:09] what we're here for and so we are agents
[38:12] we are ambassadors and I'm going to go
[38:15] into a story this story is not directly
[38:18] related but it I I believe it's going to
[38:19] be related if you'll just bear with me
[38:23] now we know that God sent the prophet to
[38:25] us amen and brother Brenham came
[38:27] and and listen it wasn't his choice to
[38:30] come it wasn't his choice to be a
[38:32] prophet of the age it wasn't his choice
[38:34] to be born in poverty it wasn't his
[38:36] choice to to have a gift in his life
[38:39] amen God did that amen God did that
[38:41] because he placed him as an agent on the
[38:43] earth for you and
[38:44] I he was an ambassador amen an
[38:47] ambassador with the word of
[38:50] reconciliation and so we know his life
[38:52] we we we've been privileged to see and
[38:55] to watch and to hear and to hear
[38:56] testimonies and know so so much about
[38:57] his life and and there's so many things
[39:00] that are striking in it but this is one
[39:02] that I want to uh draw our attention to
[39:04] and this comes from the fifth seal but
[39:06] brother benam mentions it in several
[39:08] places and it's the time that he went
[39:10] beyond the curtain of time and he begins
[39:12] speaking about this in 1960 where he
[39:15] goes beyond the curtain of time and and
[39:17] all that transpired there but here in
[39:19] the fifth seal I'm just going to pull a
[39:20] a small portion he says oh and then I
[39:23] said well isn't this wonderful and then
[39:26] I thought isn't that Wonder wonder and I
[39:28] I heard something nicker like a horse
[39:31] and I looked in my little saddle horse
[39:32] that I used to ride Little Prince I
[39:35] thought so much of him here he was
[39:37] standing there by me and put his head
[39:39] over on my shoulder to hug me like I
[39:40] used to give him sugar you know and I
[39:43] put my arm around him said Prince I know
[39:45] you'd be
[39:46] here here he is in the sixth Dimension
[39:49] with theophanes beyond the curtain of
[39:52] time and and God transports him there he
[39:55] said you know a voice says to him would
[39:57] you like to see beyond the curtain of
[39:59] time would that help he said oh it would
[40:00] help me so much and so God what is God
[40:03] trying to do with this transporting be
[40:05] on the curtain of time is to encourage
[40:07] his Prophet so would that encourage you
[40:09] he said yes that would encourage me so
[40:11] much so in the encouragement he sees all
[40:13] the people and they're running up to my
[40:15] precious brother he sees the woman that
[40:17] was saved past 90 now young and vibrant
[40:19] in in the peak of health and and now all
[40:22] of a sudden as he's taking all of this
[40:24] in he hears a little nicker and over his
[40:26] shoulder comes the head of a a horse a
[40:28] little saddle horse he had and he says I
[40:31] thought so much of
[40:34] him and then he goes on he said I felt
[40:37] something lick my
[40:39] hand there was my old
[40:42] dog and when Mr short down here poisoned
[40:45] him I swore I'd kill Mr short for it I
[40:48] was about 16 years old he poisoned him
[40:49] give him a dog Button my daddy caught me
[40:52] with a rifle going down to shoot him
[40:53] right in the police station and I said
[40:55] I'll kill him I went over to the dog's
[40:58] grave I said Fritz you've been like a
[41:00] companion to me you clothed me and sent
[41:03] me to school when you got old I was
[41:05] going to take care of you now they've
[41:07] killed you I said I promise you Fritz
[41:09] that he won't live and I said I promise
[41:11] you he won't live I'll catch him on the
[41:12] street sometime walking then I'll run
[41:15] right over him see I'll I'll get him for
[41:18] you but you know what I led the man to
[41:20] Christ baptized him in jesus' name and
[41:22] buried him at his
[41:24] death I got converted about a few years
[41:26] after that I seen things different then
[41:29] I loved him instead of hating
[41:32] him so then but however there was Fritz
[41:35] standing there licking me on the hand I
[41:38] looked I couldn't cry nobody could cry
[41:40] it was all joy you couldn't be sad cuz
[41:43] it was all happiness you couldn't die
[41:44] cuz it was all life you couldn't get old
[41:46] cuz it was all youth it was just perfect
[41:48] I thought oh isn't this wonderful and oh
[41:52] my I was right at home see and just then
[41:55] I heard a voice and it cried out out and
[41:57] said all that you ever loved then in
[42:01] parenthesis it says reward for my
[42:03] service I don't need no reward he said
[42:08] all that you ever loved and all that
[42:09] ever loved you God has given to
[42:12] you man that's such a an amazing story I
[42:17] I've meditated on that a lot and thought
[42:18] about it a lot there's many things about
[42:21] it I can't correlate there's many things
[42:23] about it I can't comprehend and a
[42:25] natural human mind kind of comp
[42:27] apprehension uh but nonetheless it's the
[42:31] truth when he went beyond the curtain of
[42:33] time there was his saddle horse that he
[42:36] thought so much of and threw and he
[42:39] threw his arm around him and he patted
[42:40] him and and it made him feel so good and
[42:43] then he felt a lick on his hand and
[42:45] there was a dog his old dog and
[42:47] you're thinking of all the things that
[42:49] this man could experience beyond the
[42:51] curtain of time of all the things that
[42:53] he could come back and tell us of all
[42:55] the important information you could
[42:57] glean from that realm and all the
[42:59] important things that can happen and all
[43:01] the things that matter the most amen
[43:03] when he comes back he begins to tell us
[43:05] of the people he saw and the experience
[43:08] he had and the position that he has and
[43:10] we learned so much from this this uh
[43:13] this translation that he had but one
[43:15] thing that is in there that is so
[43:17] astonishing to me is that God had placed
[43:20] in there a reward for a servant for
[43:22] service because he was faithful to his
[43:25] Call of Duty and he was faithful to his
[43:26] position on the earth and when he when
[43:28] he went beyond the curtain of time there
[43:30] was a reward there for him and that
[43:32] reward was a horse and a
[43:36] dog I started asking myself questions
[43:39] like do we all get a horse and a dog do
[43:42] I even want a horse and a
[43:45] dog some of you would be upset if you
[43:47] had a old dog like I don't want an
[43:49] old
[43:51] dog do you get the animal of your choice
[43:54] do you
[43:55] get you know these are just the
[43:57] questions I ask I just meditate on this
[43:59] cuz it's in the message for a reason
[44:01] it's and God told us and showed it to us
[44:03] for a purpose there's a purpose behind
[44:05] everything this isn't just trivial bits
[44:07] of information but he had this
[44:09] tremendous experience to come back not
[44:11] just to encourage him but I believe to
[44:12] encourage you and
[44:15] I and so now I I'm sitting there
[44:17] thinking why a horse and a dog and and
[44:21] what dog would I want and I'm thinking I
[44:23] wouldn't really want to be bothered with
[44:25] a dog
[44:28] but this wasn't just any horse or any
[44:30] dog this just wasn't a horse and a
[44:34] dog what what I begin to meditate on is
[44:38] we this was a a lonely little
[44:41] boy
[44:43] rejected coming up in in poverty and
[44:46] through rejection and in isolation and
[44:48] he had a gift in his life that made him
[44:50] a little odd even to his family he come
[44:54] in a status in life that made him a
[44:55] little odd and rejected and society and
[44:58] and he had something that he
[45:01] loved think about this there was
[45:03] something he loved as that struggling
[45:05] boy and listen God had to allow him to
[45:08] come the struggling way because he had a
[45:10] gift in his life that he had to use and
[45:12] there had to be character built there
[45:13] had to be a life of difficulty he had to
[45:16] go through training for his position
[45:18] because he was going to be an ambassador
[45:19] an agent of God and God had to send them
[45:22] this way he had to have the alcoholic
[45:24] father he had to see all the wrong he
[45:26] had to be rejected he had to have all of
[45:29] that but because he was doing all that
[45:30] to serve God's purpose there was some
[45:32] things in his life when he was
[45:34] struggling so much that he loved that he
[45:36] said frit you were a companion to me
[45:39] this wasn't a dog this was a lonely
[45:40] little boy who had a companion that
[45:42] would be alone with him out in the woods
[45:44] when he was trying to get away from the
[45:46] world and the rejection and the pain and
[45:47] everything else God had provided for him
[45:49] this little
[45:51] dog may not been little it could have
[45:53] been a big dog I don't
[45:54] know the whole point is to me when I
[45:57] began to meditate on this and think
[45:58] about it it was more than a horse and
[46:01] more than a
[46:07] dog it doesn't mean that I'm going to
[46:10] have a horse and have a dog or you're
[46:12] going to have a horse and have a dog
[46:14] that don't think that's what this
[46:16] means but he says it's reward for your
[46:19] service and brother I don't need a
[46:21] reward but yet
[46:23] God gave him something
[46:27] and what did God give him God gave him
[46:29] something that he
[46:31] loved that horse and that dog in the
[46:34] sixth Dimension were a product of his
[46:39] love and they were there as a result of
[46:42] his
[46:43] love that's just this just my
[46:51] observation and he said it's a reward
[46:53] for your service if you'll turn with me
[46:54] to Hebrews please
[46:57] I'm laying this in here I I I trust for
[47:01] a reason I believe for a
[47:05] reason but let's look together at
[47:07] Hebrews chapter
[47:14] 11 and let's go to verse 6 Hebrews 11
[47:17] and
[47:20] 6 says but without faith it is
[47:23] impossible to please him for he that
[47:25] cometh to God must believe that he is
[47:28] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[47:30] diligently seek him I never looked at
[47:33] this verse quite the same as I do now
[47:36] after going back and reading brother
[47:38] brenham's uh experience from The Fifth
[47:40] Dimension when he gives his experience
[47:42] beyond the curtain of time says but
[47:45] without faith it is
[47:47] impossible to please him you can't
[47:50] please God by works you can't please God
[47:52] by Church attendance you can't please
[47:54] God by intellectually knowledge of his
[47:56] Bible
[47:58] it's the only way to please God Is by
[48:00] faith am and faith in what faith in God
[48:04] what is God God is the word amen what
[48:07] word the word that's presented to you in
[48:09] your day that's the portion of God
[48:11] presented to you that's what we have to
[48:13] believe and without faith it is
[48:15] impossible to please him for he that
[48:18] cometh to God must believe that he
[48:21] is not was or will be present tense You
[48:25] Must Believe in a present tense God so
[48:28] those that come to God Must Believe in a
[48:30] present tense God you must believe that
[48:33] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[48:36] that diligently seek him so now all of a
[48:38] sudden for me to come to God I it's
[48:42] without faith is impossible to believe
[48:44] impossible to please him so I have to
[48:46] have faith faith in what faith in God
[48:48] the god that's presented to me in the
[48:50] day that I live which is the anointed
[48:52] word that's presented to us in this day
[48:54] which is the message of the hour so in
[48:57] order to please him I must believe him
[48:59] amen and if I believe him I also must I
[49:02] also must
[49:03] believe I'm sorry for he that cometh to
[49:07] God must believe that he is but I also
[49:09] must believe that he's a rewarder of
[49:11] them that diligently seek him it's
[49:14] important for me to believe that he's a
[49:16] rewarder and that's what I I I'm going
[49:19] to begin to talk about I hope that it
[49:21] comes together as clear as it is in my
[49:22] heart I hope it comes out and God makes
[49:24] it clear in your heart because there's
[49:26] something about coming as an agent of
[49:28] God as an ambassador where you're going
[49:30] to have to sacrifice yourself for the
[49:33] cause of God you're going to have to
[49:35] give up your preference and your wants
[49:37] and you're going to have brother Benham
[49:39] had to sacrifice to do his job he had to
[49:42] give up on friendship he had to give up
[49:44] on popularity he had to give up on many
[49:47] things and some of those things he
[49:49] didn't even ask to give up on but God
[49:50] put him in a position that was going to
[49:53] train him for where he would come and he
[49:55] would have to come through alcohol
[49:56] parents Our Father he'd have to come
[49:58] through rejection he'd have to come
[50:00] through poverty he didn't volunteer for
[50:02] that but yet that was also part of his
[50:04] life so that he could come and do the
[50:06] job God called him to do then he would
[50:08] have to voluntarily give up friendship
[50:10] give up popularity give up opportunities
[50:12] for wealth he would have to give up all
[50:14] of that to be what to be an agent for
[50:16] change on this Earth to be an ambassador
[50:18] of Jesus Christ on this Earth and so
[50:21] doing so Amen in order to come to God by
[50:24] faith and to please God am and to know
[50:27] you have to know that he's a rewarder of
[50:29] those that diligently seek him because
[50:31] if you know he's a rewarder of those
[50:33] that diligently seek Him you can give
[50:35] everything up to follow him to be an
[50:37] agent to serve him to be an ambassador
[50:40] because God's going to take care of it
[50:41] in the
[50:48] end he didn't make it
[50:51] optional in verse
[50:53] 6 without faith it is impossible to
[50:55] please him for he that cometh to God
[50:57] must believe that he is and that he's a
[51:00] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[51:04] Him for us to do the job that God's
[51:06] called us to do we must believe that
[51:10] he's a rewarder amen of those that
[51:12] diligently seek him because for us to do
[51:15] what he's called us to do we're going to
[51:17] have to give up surrender
[51:21] sacrifice because we're not here for
[51:23] ourselves we're not here for our
[51:24] reputation we're not here to serve our
[51:26] purpose we're here as ambassadors for
[51:30] Christ we're here as agents of God that
[51:32] he's put into the Earth to accomplish
[51:34] his purpose we're not here for our own
[51:36] self-gratification we're not here to
[51:38] build wealth we're not here uh uh to to
[51:41] gain what we can gain out of this life
[51:43] materially we're actually been placed
[51:45] here to be an agent for him and to be an
[51:47] agent for him I've got to give up many
[51:49] of those things I've got to give up I
[51:51] mean there's some Ambitions we just have
[51:53] to give up amen when they come to you
[51:55] and offer you a promotion and you're
[51:56] going to get a lot more money but you're
[51:58] going to have to move away from the
[51:59] church God placed you in and where
[52:01] there's no Fellowship amen you're going
[52:02] to have to surrender that to stay an
[52:04] agent amen praise
[52:07] God
[52:09] Amen when they want to give you a
[52:11] scholarship to go to school but they're
[52:13] going to send you somewhere where you
[52:15] have no Fellowship you can't serve God
[52:17] you can't go to church you can't be in
[52:18] fellowship and you say I'm turning down
[52:20] the scholarship because I'm an agent for
[52:22] Jesus Christ I'm an ambassador amen you
[52:25] have to believe that he's a rewarder of
[52:27] those that diligently seek him so that
[52:29] you can surrender your life and let God
[52:31] handle it all let God keep the records
[52:34] he's a rewarder I don't have to worry
[52:36] about
[52:41] it I want to look at a story here that
[52:45] brother M tells in many places but in
[52:47] this place I'm looking at is to look
[52:49] away to
[52:50] Jesus he's talking about sister Hatty
[52:53] Wright and sister Hattie Wright was her
[52:55] maiden name she was have the family she
[52:57] had been married and her husband passed
[52:58] away she had a different last name but I
[53:00] don't recall what that is but we all
[53:02] know where his had he
[53:03] right and we know the story of Howdy
[53:06] write how she was in poverty she was a
[53:07] widow she had two teenage boys she was
[53:09] Raising and brother man said she was
[53:11] scratching out a living with a hoe and a
[53:13] shovel and a little piece of land and
[53:15] and didn't have hardly
[53:17] anything and brother bam goes to the wri
[53:20] house brother and sister Wright and
[53:22] they're all gathered in the house and
[53:24] and he tells the story many times and he
[53:26] gives all these little details H Hattie
[53:28] was sitting off to the side she wasn't
[53:30] even the main part of the conversation
[53:31] she was sitting in the back off to the
[53:33] side keeping real real quiet brother B
[53:35] said she wasn't saying anything she
[53:37] wasn't the center of attention she was
[53:39] just kind of on the outside of the
[53:40] circle there at the house at her
[53:42] parents' home and her boys were there
[53:45] they were sitting off to the side as
[53:46] well and brother B starts to relay the
[53:50] story of the creation of squirrels how
[53:53] God came to him in the woods and and
[53:56] began to speak to him and and and told
[53:58] him that you have need of squirrels and
[54:00] he spoke and they come this way and and
[54:02] this one crossed the field and climbed
[54:03] the tree and shot it out he's going
[54:05] through the details of this creation and
[54:08] he's talking about how God had commanded
[54:10] him to speak and whatever he said would
[54:12] come to pass and brother benham's words
[54:15] now became the spoken word and that
[54:17] spoken word Had Creative power and it
[54:19] create a squirrel where there was no
[54:22] squirrel right so we we want to I I want
[54:26] to uh understand the magnitude of this
[54:30] story listen you and I have heard that
[54:32] story how many
[54:35] times we've heard it we've heard it on
[54:38] tape we've heard other people talk about
[54:40] hearing the brother tell the story we we
[54:43] we've come to accept it as a
[54:46] fact but this was the first time the
[54:48] right family ever heard
[54:50] it this was their first
[54:53] time and listen put yourself
[54:56] in their place Amen in that day they
[54:59] loved brother bam they appreciated him
[55:01] they knew he had a gift in his life but
[55:02] yet the full realization of who he was
[55:05] in the scripture was not made known at
[55:07] that day that's when he began to tell
[55:09] this in the I think it was 59 or 60 or
[55:12] something like that he begins to talk
[55:14] about this experience amen they didn't
[55:16] know amen that he was Revelation 10:7
[55:19] they didn't know that he was the seventh
[55:20] angel these things were just beginning
[55:22] to come to light but they knew that he
[55:25] was a man of God they knew that that he
[55:26] loved him and they knew he had a gift in
[55:28] his life and they knew he was a prophet
[55:30] but the full magnitude of who this was
[55:32] sitting in their living room had not
[55:34] sunk in
[55:35] yet and so now this is their brother in
[55:38] church just like one of your brothers
[55:40] here in church is over at your house and
[55:41] they're telling you I was in the woods
[55:43] the other
[55:46] day I was hunting up against a tree and
[55:49] the squirrels weren't moving and I
[55:50] couldn't find a squirrel anywhere and I
[55:52] hunted all morning and I was just
[55:53] sitting there and and all of a sudden
[55:55] The Voice come down through and and said
[55:58] speak and whatever you say it'll be and
[56:00] and and and I said what God he says what
[56:01] do you what I speak for what do you have
[56:03] need of you're hunting aren't you and he
[56:04] said I then then you know brother is
[56:06] telling the story listen this is a this
[56:08] is a brother in your church this is your
[56:10] pastor who's come to
[56:16] dinner
[56:17] saying I said this squirrel will come
[56:20] down here and run across the field run
[56:22] up there and the nest one will be in in
[56:24] a in a locust tree which they never in a
[56:26] locust tree this will will climb a
[56:27] sycamore they don't like to climb a
[56:29] Sycamore and all of these things and he
[56:32] tells them about shooting them and about
[56:33] going and getting them and they're
[56:35] bleeding and a vision doesn't bleed and
[56:37] all and and he tells this
[56:39] story and off in the back to the side
[56:42] and the Outer Circle of the fellowship
[56:44] that's taking place little Hattie he
[56:47] said this is what brother B says and
[56:49] little Hattie said the right word she
[56:51] said that's nothing but the truth
[56:57] brother baham started relating this
[56:59] story to Abraham amen uh offering Isaac
[57:03] and Jehovah Gyra providing a ram in the
[57:05] thicket and where there was no Ram God
[57:08] created a ram and he's starting to tie
[57:09] that scripture to this experience in the
[57:11] woods and he's starting to to to to to
[57:14] talk about Jesus said and you'll do the
[57:16] Greater Works and and he and he's tying
[57:19] these scriptures but had he right amen
[57:22] when she was hearing him describe this
[57:24] and hearing the story in inside of her
[57:27] she knew that was nothing but the
[57:32] truth it was nothing but the truth but
[57:36] he didn't point to a scripture and say
[57:39] that William Brenham will speak
[57:40] squirrels to existence or that anybody
[57:42] will speak squirrels into existence or
[57:44] that anybody will speak anything into
[57:49] existence he's relating it to the
[57:51] scriptures to the promise in the Church
[57:53] of Greater Works he's tying it together
[57:55] to the nature of Jehovah Gyra amen he's
[57:58] doing all that but he's not telling her
[58:00] the Bible said someday there'll be a man
[58:03] that comes to Earth that's given the
[58:05] power of the spoken word amen to
[58:07] manifest the the the third pool the
[58:09] Redemptive Rights of Man coming back
[58:10] into man and he's going to speak and
[58:13] God's going to create squirrels she
[58:14] couldn't base this Faith Off reading
[58:20] something she couldn't base this Faith
[58:23] off an intellectual argument where
[58:25] things are put tightly
[58:28] together this was something that came
[58:30] from her soul this was something she
[58:33] knew that this man is telling the truth
[58:36] what he said happened in the woods is
[58:38] nothing but the truth that came from the
[58:40] depths of a soul that came from a c Gene
[58:42] of God that didn't come from a mind
[58:44] because the mind wasn't being titillated
[58:46] with facts and figures and documents and
[58:49] and and paper amen that was something
[58:51] she was hearing for the very first time
[58:53] that she never even knew needed to be
[58:55] done by man that wasn't a scripture
[58:57] verse saying that that exactly thing
[58:59] would happen but inside of her she knew
[59:01] that this is God what was she doing she
[59:05] was believing that God is amen this is a
[59:08] present tense God working right now
[59:10] through the Flesh of this man right here
[59:12] that's nothing but the truth that's
[59:14] nothing but God that's absolutely right
[59:16] you're not making it up this is the
[59:21] truth and somebody could have said Hade
[59:24] what Bible verse are you referencing she
[59:26] I don't even know what Bible verse I'm
[59:28] referencing there's something inside of
[59:29] me that's referencing back saying that's
[59:32] the
[59:36] truth you must believe that he is
[59:42] am brother B says and when she said that
[59:44] brother Banks Woods here is one that was
[59:47] present the room felt like it was coming
[59:49] apart prise God and the Holy Spirit said
[59:51] the voice the same voice that spoke
[59:53] about this girl said give her what she
[59:56] asked
[59:58] for give her what she asked
[1:00:01] for
[1:00:02] amen and she looked around and said what
[1:00:05] shall I say brother
[1:00:08] brandham I said say what your desire is
[1:00:11] think of your greatest desire and say it
[1:00:14] brother B was saying that he himself the
[1:00:18] man who just told the story about
[1:00:19] creating squirrels in existence and
[1:00:21] having the power of the spoken word he's
[1:00:23] telling her maybe ask for healing for
[1:00:25] your sister maybe ask for $10,000
[1:00:28] whatever you want God will give it to
[1:00:31] you so here the man who told the story
[1:00:33] and the man who gives the promise is
[1:00:35] trying to qux her I'm just not qux her
[1:00:37] he's just he's just throwing out
[1:00:40] ideas maybe this maybe that whatever you
[1:00:43] ask for amen and there's something
[1:00:46] whatever whatever it was that stirred
[1:00:48] her to believe that was nothing but the
[1:00:50] truth was still stirring inside of
[1:00:53] her and brother said and her boys was
[1:00:55] even snickering and laughing and she
[1:00:57] said the greatest desire I have is the
[1:00:59] Salvation of my two sons and I said I
[1:01:02] give them to you in the name of Jesus
[1:01:04] Christ and there they went brother B
[1:01:06] said they those boys were even
[1:01:07] snickering and laughing and in the side
[1:01:09] and joking and all of a sudden
[1:01:10] immediately when he says that they fall
[1:01:12] on their mother's lap weeping and
[1:01:13] repenting they come to church they
[1:01:15] baptize him he said later in a message
[1:01:17] they're even participating in feet
[1:01:19] washing amen what was it amen he that
[1:01:23] you cannot please God yes without faith
[1:01:27] amen and he that cometh to God must
[1:01:29] believe that he is present tense God she
[1:01:34] you know what she didn't say hadie
[1:01:36] Wright was not saying I believe in you
[1:01:38] brother bam she's saying that's nothing
[1:01:41] but the truth what you said is the word
[1:01:43] it's truth it's God it's right it's
[1:01:45] absolutely true she was recognizing God
[1:01:49] in her
[1:01:50] midst when Millions would scratch their
[1:01:53] heads when Millions would say I that
[1:01:56] story I don't know I need to know a
[1:01:58] little more show me a little bit where
[1:02:00] does it tie in the
[1:02:04] scriptures there was something in that
[1:02:06] woman that could
[1:02:08] believe now don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:02:10] I'm not saying we don't look in the
[1:02:12] scriptures we we must find everything we
[1:02:15] believe in the word of God that's why
[1:02:17] God's given it to us but this woman had
[1:02:20] Faith genuine Faith from a seed of
[1:02:24] God Amen and God was so pleased with her
[1:02:30] response God didn't say Haddie you're
[1:02:32] little reckless you may want to be
[1:02:34] careful pray about this first and go
[1:02:36] search it
[1:02:37] out you're being just a little bit
[1:02:39] irresponsible Hattie God didn't say that
[1:02:43] because God knew it was truth and she
[1:02:46] knew it was truth and she was in
[1:02:48] alignment with
[1:02:50] God God was so pleased with her faith
[1:02:55] what pleased
[1:02:56] what was God pleased with her
[1:03:00] faith he was so pleased with her faith
[1:03:03] he told his Prophet give her whatever
[1:03:05] she
[1:03:06] wants and she's wondering this and that
[1:03:10] what should I
[1:03:11] do and all of a sudden she said the
[1:03:14] greatest desire of my heart is the
[1:03:16] Salvation in my two
[1:03:17] boys and he said listen brother Ben said
[1:03:20] I give them to you in the name of Jesus
[1:03:24] Christ amen
[1:03:27] those boys were saved not on the Merit
[1:03:29] of their
[1:03:31] actions but on the faith of their mother
[1:03:35] and her love for
[1:03:39] them she received a reward praise God
[1:03:43] Amen she received a
[1:03:45] reward what was that when God told
[1:03:47] Propet give her whatever she asked for
[1:03:49] that's a
[1:03:53] reward those boys salvation
[1:03:56] was not because they were repentant they
[1:03:58] were over in the corner
[1:04:00] snickering not because they were
[1:04:01] interested in the things of God they
[1:04:03] were disinterested in the things of
[1:04:05] God but they were her
[1:04:08] reward and they could not resist the
[1:04:11] hand of God when the presence of God
[1:04:12] fell and the hand of God fell they
[1:04:14] couldn't hold back anymore and it
[1:04:16] brought them to weeping and to
[1:04:17] repentance and the baptism in Jesus name
[1:04:19] and all of that and and and it was
[1:04:22] because of a mother's Faith she was she
[1:04:25] she was a a an agent of God she was
[1:04:28] standing on the earth she had a c Gene
[1:04:30] of God she had Faith genuine faith in
[1:04:33] the word of God a god that is and when
[1:04:35] she expressed that brother B said she
[1:04:37] said the right word and when she said
[1:04:39] the right word God was so pleased to
[1:04:41] give her what she wants said what I want
[1:04:43] is the Salvation of my boys and God
[1:04:45] didn't say if you can get them to repent
[1:04:47] if you can get them to straighten up
[1:04:48] their life if you can get them to start
[1:04:50] coming to church he just said I give
[1:04:52] them to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:04] amen without faith it is impossible to
[1:05:08] please
[1:05:10] God and those that come to him must
[1:05:12] believe that he is and that he's a
[1:05:15] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:05:18] him it's important to understand that
[1:05:22] God is a
[1:05:23] rewarder amen of those that diligently
[1:05:25] seek seek
[1:05:27] Him
[1:05:29] amen as we move from there I want to
[1:05:32] keep moving down this line of being
[1:05:34] agents of change or ambassadors for
[1:05:38] Christ let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:05:49] 7 now there's one thing that I would
[1:05:52] like to address while we're here
[1:05:58] is I don't want to draw any conclusions
[1:06:03] by what I just said I mean I shouldn't
[1:06:05] say any conclusion everybody's going to
[1:06:06] draw conclusions
[1:06:08] but I don't want you to think that I'm
[1:06:11] saying that all of our loved ones and
[1:06:14] all of our children and everybody we
[1:06:16] know will be saved because somebody and
[1:06:18] ask brother Brown that question somebody
[1:06:20] come in 1964 questions and answers and
[1:06:23] they say well all the children of
[1:06:25] believer in parents be saved and brother
[1:06:27] B said
[1:06:28] no said
[1:06:30] no so I don't want you to take what I'm
[1:06:33] saying further than what the prophet
[1:06:35] took it and what the truth really
[1:06:38] is but I do believe he's a
[1:06:42] rewarder how he M meets it out and in
[1:06:45] what measure I cannot
[1:06:47] control I cannot dictate to God I cannot
[1:06:50] control I cannot force I cannot make but
[1:06:53] one thing I can do is I can believe
[1:06:55] believe that he's a rewarder I can have
[1:06:58] faith in his ability to reward I can
[1:07:00] have faith in his goodness and his
[1:07:02] righteousness and his understanding and
[1:07:04] if he could understand the love a
[1:07:05] prophet had for a horse and a dog he can
[1:07:08] understand the love that I
[1:07:10] have the situations I come through the
[1:07:13] the the needs that I had amen the people
[1:07:15] who met those needs I believe God can
[1:07:18] reward for all of that I don't know how
[1:07:20] I don't know how it all work I'm not
[1:07:22] here to explain it all I cannot explain
[1:07:24] it all I don't know how all of that
[1:07:26] worked but I know for a fact that it
[1:07:30] worked and so don't don't get carried
[1:07:33] away too far because if you I'm we're
[1:07:35] going to read here we're going to find
[1:07:36] out if we take the wrong understanding
[1:07:38] and the wrong thinking it's going to
[1:07:40] produce the wrong
[1:07:42] actions let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:07:48] 7 Matthew 7:
[1:07:53] 7 says in Matthew chap 7:7 he said ask
[1:07:57] and it shall be given you seek and you
[1:07:59] shall find knock and it shall be open
[1:08:01] unto you for everyone that asketh
[1:08:03] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:08:05] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:08:07] opened or what or what man is there of
[1:08:10] you whom if his son ask bread will he
[1:08:13] give him a stone or if he ask a fish
[1:08:15] will he give him a serpent if you then
[1:08:17] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:08:18] unto your children how much more shall
[1:08:20] your father which is in heaven give good
[1:08:23] things to them that ask him
[1:08:26] these scriptures must become a
[1:08:29] reality this has to move from that's a
[1:08:32] nice scripture to that scripture is for
[1:08:34] me amen and I believe it to be
[1:08:37] true in the message the token of been
[1:08:41] reading in the token uh all day
[1:08:43] yesterday and brother B makes this
[1:08:46] statement he says now watch fully now
[1:08:48] full fully obedience to the whole word
[1:08:50] of God entitled us to the Token then
[1:08:53] when we pray we we must have the token
[1:08:57] to present with our prayer if you say I
[1:08:59] pray Lord but really I I haven't well
[1:09:02] you don't just might as well stop go
[1:09:04] ahead first get the token because that
[1:09:06] token is what he'll recognize see yes
[1:09:09] sir we're going to talk in a minute on
[1:09:10] what the token is when we pray then we
[1:09:13] must present the token Lord I have
[1:09:15] obeyed you fully I have repented of my
[1:09:18] sins I feel you have forgiven me I've
[1:09:21] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ the holy spirit is upon me now I
[1:09:25] have need of a certain thing for your
[1:09:27] glory Lord I ask for it it's mine now
[1:09:30] then there is something anchors back
[1:09:32] here and he says it's yours that does it
[1:09:35] then it's all over it's all over it's
[1:09:37] settled I ask for this I ask for it I
[1:09:40] must have it I want it For Your Glory
[1:09:42] see well that's it then he just gives it
[1:09:45] to you then you know it's yours that's
[1:09:47] the way it is our children so forth we
[1:09:49] apply the blood believe it that's all so
[1:09:53] brother Benham is saying listen he
[1:09:55] saying now you must apply the token in
[1:09:57] your prayer what is the token and we'll
[1:09:59] read a quote in a minute but what is the
[1:10:01] token he said it's the literal life of
[1:10:03] Jesus Christ the same life that was
[1:10:05] released at Calvary when the blood cell
[1:10:07] was broken that same life is now back in
[1:10:09] The Believer it's the life of Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ it's the power that changed you
[1:10:14] it's the thing that opened the word to
[1:10:15] you amen and when you pray you present
[1:10:17] that token back because what is the
[1:10:19] token that token is the life of
[1:10:23] God and in your prayer you're saying
[1:10:25] Lord I have received this life this life
[1:10:28] that changed me this life that birthed
[1:10:30] me this life that brought me into your
[1:10:32] word and I'm presenting my request with
[1:10:35] your life back to you and you said if I
[1:10:37] ask for anything I can have it and I'm
[1:10:40] asking for this because listen he says I
[1:10:42] need it for your glory what brother bam
[1:10:44] showing us is he's checking the motive
[1:10:46] checking the objective asking for the
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:50] reasons and presenting the token
[1:10:55] the token remember when we spoke about
[1:10:58] priest I believe it was Wednesday maybe
[1:11:00] I've got that wrong by now but when we
[1:11:02] spoke about the priest the priest every
[1:11:05] priesthood must have blood to present as
[1:11:07] they
[1:11:08] intercede because with intercession has
[1:11:10] to come blood amen for an atonement to
[1:11:13] cover the sins and so we as a a royal
[1:11:16] priesthood we're under the order of MDC
[1:11:18] and ELC was not an ordinance after
[1:11:21] Cardinal ordinances but after an
[1:11:22] everlasting life it was the ordinance of
[1:11:25] life life in the high priest of of of
[1:11:27] mzc who Jesus Christ now took on that
[1:11:31] high priest role of
[1:11:32] mzc so we are priest under the high
[1:11:35] priest which means what we are priest
[1:11:38] with life amen the everlasting life
[1:11:40] eternal life and that's the life of the
[1:11:43] blood that we present with our request
[1:11:45] which is God's own life that he shed
[1:11:47] amen for you and I now we're recipients
[1:11:49] of that life and when we come to God
[1:11:51] it's not just with a request but it's a
[1:11:53] request with a token we've got the we're
[1:11:55] interceding now for something or
[1:11:57] somebody God because we've got life to
[1:11:59] present to you we're recipients of Life
[1:12:02] here's the sacrifice here's the life
[1:12:04] here's where it abides and now I'm doing
[1:12:06] my role as a priest and interceding for
[1:12:08] somebody else am it's really important
[1:12:12] that we come the right way brother B
[1:12:16] said that's the way we come and when we
[1:12:19] come by faith listen brother B say it's
[1:12:22] not words this is not just a a a Rec
[1:12:25] writing of words and then walking away
[1:12:26] and saying I've applied the token no
[1:12:29] it's Faith it's an operation of faith
[1:12:31] believing who you are in the life that's
[1:12:33] in you and it's desperation and
[1:12:35] intercession and requesting before God
[1:12:38] and when you do that he said all of a
[1:12:40] sudden as you're doing that the
[1:12:42] something anchors back
[1:12:45] here what is that that's a revelation
[1:12:48] that God's answered your prayer
[1:12:49] something anchors and then you have it
[1:12:51] then it's settled brother Brenham never
[1:12:54] made it an act verbalization and walking
[1:12:56] away and saying I applied the token now
[1:12:58] I have it no he said you apply it by
[1:13:01] faith and then something anchors back
[1:13:04] here all of a sudden you know he's
[1:13:06] answered your request you know you
[1:13:08] contacted God and you know he heard and
[1:13:10] you know he answered then you can walk
[1:13:11] away and say thank you God you're going
[1:13:13] to have whatsoever you asked
[1:13:16] for amen until that happens you just
[1:13:19] keep interceding you keep reminding God
[1:13:21] I'm still believing in this I'm still
[1:13:23] holding on to the promise I'm still
[1:13:25] standing in the Gap I'm still believing
[1:13:27] but when when it anchors in your soul
[1:13:29] it's yours it's
[1:13:32] finished and so we realize as agents on
[1:13:36] the earth as ambassadors for Christ we
[1:13:39] hold a special role of
[1:13:42] intercession that most of the world
[1:13:44] doesn't
[1:13:46] have we know who we are and where we
[1:13:49] came
[1:13:51] from we know our relationship to God we
[1:13:55] also know what he's done for our life
[1:13:56] and what he's given to us of his own
[1:13:58] life we're recipients of the life we're
[1:14:00] carriers of the life and so that puts us
[1:14:04] in a different position alog together
[1:14:07] now this is why I went into the things
[1:14:11] that I went into with hadie Wright and
[1:14:13] brother Brenham beyond the curtain of
[1:14:14] time is because if we know our position
[1:14:17] and that we're here as ambassadors and
[1:14:19] we we have resources the world doesn't
[1:14:22] have we have a position the world
[1:14:25] doesn't have and we have a life the
[1:14:26] world doesn't
[1:14:28] have then that means our life should be
[1:14:31] a life of love and service because no
[1:14:33] one else in the world can do
[1:14:37] it we have to
[1:14:39] sacrifice and give and project love
[1:14:44] because if we don't do it who else is
[1:14:46] going to do
[1:14:47] it if we don't stand in the Gap who else
[1:14:50] is qualified to stand on the Gap if we
[1:14:52] don't intercede who else is qualified to
[1:14:54] intercede
[1:14:56] am but in order for me to do that means
[1:14:58] I'm going to have to
[1:15:00] give I'm going to have to give him
[1:15:02] myself I'm going to have to give
[1:15:04] sacrificially I'm going to have to love
[1:15:06] first so there going to be love in
[1:15:08] return I'm going to have to stand in the
[1:15:09] Gap and when spit on I can't spit back
[1:15:12] when ried on I can't RI back amen when
[1:15:15] when Jesus was hanging on the cross he
[1:15:17] was in this position of intercession he
[1:15:19] was interceding for the sins of the
[1:15:20] people and they were mocking him making
[1:15:22] fun of him laughing at him spitting on
[1:15:24] him amen they they humiliated him by
[1:15:26] stripping him naked they falsely accused
[1:15:28] him they did everything they could
[1:15:30] possibly do to him and what was he doing
[1:15:32] he was standing there wide open Bare
[1:15:35] before them humiliated degraded abused
[1:15:39] beaten within a a few inches of his life
[1:15:42] and now they're walking by wagging their
[1:15:44] heads making fun of him making false
[1:15:46] claims about what he
[1:15:48] claimed you know what he
[1:15:51] says father amen praise God forgive
[1:15:57] them but they don't know what they're
[1:15:59] doing
[1:16:07] amise God how can you stand in that
[1:16:11] position unless you know that he's a
[1:16:17] rewarder he's a rewarder friends he
[1:16:21] doesn't miss
[1:16:22] anything nothing goes unnoticed
[1:16:25] God will take care of it all you can
[1:16:28] give up yourself cuz he's a
[1:16:30] rewarder you can sacrifice yourself cuz
[1:16:33] he's a reward you can give your time
[1:16:34] your energy you can give your reputation
[1:16:36] you can give your health you can give
[1:16:39] you can give your time and go pray why
[1:16:41] cuz he's a rewarder I don't have to
[1:16:43] preserve myself preserve my time
[1:16:44] preserve my reputation I don't have to
[1:16:46] provide for myself or make sure that I
[1:16:48] get what I have do me at the end of The
[1:16:50] Journey he's a rewarder I can be an
[1:16:53] ambassador I can give and give give and
[1:16:55] give and give because he's a
[1:16:57] rewarder not that we even feel like we
[1:16:59] deserve a reward brother B didn't feel
[1:17:01] like he deserved a reward but I'm
[1:17:03] telling you something God is so gracious
[1:17:05] so go loving so merciful that when
[1:17:07] brother bren's beyond the curtain of
[1:17:08] time there is a
[1:17:12] horse oh let that sink in there's a
[1:17:17] dog a dog beyond the curtain of time
[1:17:20] that's the luckiest dog that has ever
[1:17:22] lived
[1:17:24] [Applause]
[1:17:26] of the billions of dogs that's been on
[1:17:28] the face of the Earth that's the
[1:17:29] luckiest dog that I
[1:17:32] know God is so mindful so thoughtful so
[1:17:36] understanding he saw he saw the
[1:17:38] sacrifice of that little boy he saw the
[1:17:40] pain he saw the suffering he was going
[1:17:41] to bring it for good he saw it all amen
[1:17:44] he knew he knew all that he was going to
[1:17:46] suffer with and all he was going to go
[1:17:47] go through but God is a rewarder friends
[1:17:49] he's a rewarder we don't have to worry
[1:17:51] about it he's going to take better care
[1:17:54] of us than we
[1:17:56] expected I don't think the prophet of
[1:17:58] God brother bam never I don't believe
[1:18:00] now I can't say never but we don't ever
[1:18:02] hear him say I never hear Brother B say
[1:18:05] I always prayed that my horse would be
[1:18:06] in
[1:18:08] heaven I always wanted Fritz to be with
[1:18:10] me in
[1:18:12] heaven he believed you'd be there he he
[1:18:14] told Fritz if there's a a place in
[1:18:16] heaven for dogs you'll be
[1:18:18] there but God was taking care of it for
[1:18:21] him because God's a rewarder
[1:18:26] sometimes we worry so much about
[1:18:30] preservation we worry so much about our
[1:18:33] reputation our
[1:18:35] feelings our heartaches our
[1:18:39] sacrifices when somebody else ask us of
[1:18:42] us something and we've already given we
[1:18:46] start to get
[1:18:48] frustrated the problem is we're we're
[1:18:51] frustrated because we're trying to
[1:18:52] preserve some more of our time or more
[1:18:53] of our energy
[1:18:57] and there's times that you have to
[1:18:58] preserve or else you'll collapse I
[1:19:02] mean but there's times that we just get
[1:19:04] offended because I want to keep my time
[1:19:07] and I don't want to sacrifice and I
[1:19:08] don't want to
[1:19:11] surrender but if we continually reward
[1:19:14] ourselves where will our reward
[1:19:17] be we're here not for ourselves but
[1:19:20] we're here as
[1:19:21] agents and there's a benefit for that I
[1:19:25] would like to turn to Genesis 18
[1:19:41] together Genesis Chapter
[1:19:45] 18 and let's begin with verse
[1:19:48] 20 we find before this that God comes to
[1:19:52] Abraham in flesh from The Plains of man
[1:19:54] and he begins to explain to him that
[1:19:56] Sodom and gomorah are going to be
[1:19:58] destroyed and Abraham begins to barter
[1:20:00] with God for the lives of the people in
[1:20:02] Sodom and he and he and he says here
[1:20:05] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[1:20:07] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:20:08] nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
[1:20:10] him for I know him that he will command
[1:20:12] his children and his household after him
[1:20:14] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:20:16] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[1:20:18] may bring upon Abraham that which he
[1:20:20] hath spoken of him and the Lord said
[1:20:22] because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
[1:20:24] great and because their sin is very
[1:20:25] Grievous I will go down now and see
[1:20:28] whether they have done all together
[1:20:30] according to the Cry of it which is come
[1:20:32] unto me and if not I will
[1:20:34] know and the men turned their face from
[1:20:37] hence and went toward Sodom but Abraham
[1:20:39] stood yet before the Lord and Abraham
[1:20:41] Drew near and said wil thou also destroy
[1:20:44] the righteous with the wicked per
[1:20:47] Adventure there be 50 righteous within
[1:20:48] the city wil thou also destroy and not
[1:20:50] spare the place for 50 righteous that
[1:20:52] are therein he begins to talked to God
[1:20:55] and said would you destroy would you and
[1:20:58] he in what what Abraham is doing now is
[1:21:01] he's standing in the Gap he's beginning
[1:21:03] to intercede with God and he's praying
[1:21:05] to God he's talking to God about would
[1:21:08] you is there any way you could spare it
[1:21:09] would you destroy it if there's
[1:21:10] righteous if there's 50 and he said I
[1:21:12] wouldn't for 50 then he goes I think to
[1:21:14] 45 or 40 and 30 and 20 and he works his
[1:21:17] way down amen but but but Abraham is
[1:21:22] concerned amen Abraham has a family on
[1:21:25] his mind he's concerned about somebody
[1:21:27] in Sodom he's concerned a uh he's
[1:21:30] concerned about life and he's standing
[1:21:32] in the Gap to preserve life and we know
[1:21:35] that Abraham has a nephew down there
[1:21:37] that he
[1:21:38] loves and love is compelling Abraham to
[1:21:41] stand in the Gap God would you destroy
[1:21:43] it now don't destroy what about 50 what
[1:21:45] about this and he keeps coming back to
[1:21:47] God and he keeps working until finally
[1:21:49] God stops and God leaves the
[1:21:52] conversation Abraham would have went
[1:21:55] down to one if God stayed there would
[1:21:57] you destroy it if there was one
[1:22:00] righteous and and so we know that it was
[1:22:02] lot that he was concerned for and when
[1:22:04] we look at Genesis
[1:22:05] 19 verse
[1:22:09] 27 it says and Abraham got up early in
[1:22:14] the morning to the place where he stood
[1:22:15] before the Lord and he looked towards
[1:22:17] Sodom and gor and toward all the land of
[1:22:20] the plain and behold and lo the smoke of
[1:22:22] the country went up as the the smoke of
[1:22:24] a furnace and it came to pass when God
[1:22:27] destroyed the cities of the plain that
[1:22:29] God remembered Abraham and sent lot out
[1:22:32] of the midst of the overthrow when he
[1:22:34] overthrew the cities in which lot
[1:22:37] dwelt God did not remember
[1:22:40] lot God remembered
[1:22:44] Abraham God saved lot although lot was
[1:22:48] righteous and Sodom vexed his righteous
[1:22:50] Soul the sins that were there there was
[1:22:52] something good about lot also but the
[1:22:55] scripture says it didn't say God
[1:22:56] remembered lot's righteousness and sent
[1:22:58] him out it says God remembered Abraham
[1:23:01] and sent out
[1:23:02] lot amen Abraham's intercession listen
[1:23:06] he didn't get an answer God didn't say
[1:23:08] don't worry lot's going to be okay
[1:23:10] because he woke up in the morning and he
[1:23:12] went and stood in the spot and he looked
[1:23:13] and he saw the smoke and the fire coming
[1:23:15] up who knows what he felt on the inside
[1:23:17] but God knew what was inside Abraham and
[1:23:20] Abraham had left all and separated all
[1:23:22] and given up and been mocked and r for a
[1:23:25] stand on the word and God remembered
[1:23:27] Abraham and he brought lot out he's a
[1:23:30] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:23:33] him I believe it amen man let's go to
[1:23:36] Joshua chapter
[1:23:49] 2 Joshua chapter 2
[1:23:56] verse
[1:24:00] 12 this is the story of Rahab and
[1:24:02] Jericho and she had received the spies
[1:24:04] and hid the spies and and now the spies

[1:24:24] father and my mother my brethren my

[1:24:39] and she believed that God is amen what
[1:24:41] was Rahab believing when those two spies
[1:24:43] came she believed the god that is in her
[1:24:45] day she believed that this is God this
[1:24:48] is God's representation this is God's
[1:24:50] move amen and she believed that they
[1:24:52] were going to come and sweep through the
[1:24:53] land why she was believing in the
[1:24:55] present tense word of God she was
[1:24:57] believing in present tense

[1:25:01] God she her her fa her faith went into
[1:25:04] action and she preserved the life of the

[1:25:33] from Death she wasn't just concerned for
[1:25:36] herself she was concerned for her
[1:25:40] family Joshua
[1:25:42] 2:17 let's go down to verse 17 and the
[1:25:45] men said unto her we will be blameless
[1:25:47] of this thine oath which thou has made
[1:25:49] us swear behold when we come into the
[1:25:52] land Thou shalt bind this line of
[1:25:53] scarlet in the window which thou did let
[1:25:55] us down by and thou shalt bring thy
[1:25:58] father and thy mother and thy Brethren
[1:26:01] and all thy father's household home unto
[1:26:03] thee and it shall be that whosoever
[1:26:05] shall go out of the doors of thy house
[1:26:06] into the street his blood shall be upon
[1:26:08] his head and we will be Guiltless and
[1:26:10] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[1:26:12] house his blood shall be on our heads if
[1:26:14] any be upon him now they promised a
[1:26:18] Salvation to her family if she if Rahab
[1:26:21] could get her family under the token
[1:26:24] that they gave her amen she had a token
[1:26:26] if she could get her family under the
[1:26:28] token they could be saved amen what was
[1:26:31] the salvation of her family first it was
[1:26:33] rahab's faith and then it was her
[1:26:37] love rahab's Faith Made A Way made a
[1:26:41] token that was rahab's faith God
[1:26:43] rewarded her with a token because she
[1:26:45] believed the god that is amen but what
[1:26:47] was what was the open door of Salvation
[1:26:49] to her father and her mother and her
[1:26:51] Brethren and her sisters and all her
[1:26:52] family it was her love love for them
[1:26:55] that opened the door because her faith
[1:26:57] gave her a token her love gave them an
[1:26:59] Open Door praise God God is always
[1:27:03] saving by faith and love Faith and love
[1:27:05] Faith and love Faith and love and if we
[1:27:08] have faith who do we love if we have
[1:27:10] faith who do we
[1:27:12] love wonder my goodness we're agents for
[1:27:17] God we're ambassadors for God we're on
[1:27:19] Earth for a
[1:27:22] reason how he writes boys were saved by
[1:27:25] faith and Love A Mother's Love brother
[1:27:29] brandham brother bram's horse and his
[1:27:31] dog were in heaven well he said what in
[1:27:34] heaven of sixth
[1:27:36] Dimension his horse and his dog are in a
[1:27:38] sixth Dimension why because of his faith
[1:27:40] and his
[1:27:43] love oh my goodness God is so
[1:27:48] good in the message desperation brother
[1:27:51] benam says this
[1:27:54] he's going to describe to us what the
[1:27:55] token is so now we have sometimes
[1:27:58] allowed it the Lutheran allowed it to
[1:28:00] accepting the word accepting Christ as
[1:28:01] personal savior the Methodist said when
[1:28:04] you get happy enough to shout that's it
[1:28:06] the Pentecostal says speak in tongues
[1:28:08] then you got it and we find out that all
[1:28:09] of it was wrong the token is the token
[1:28:13] it's you and Christ as persons
[1:28:16] together it's the Holy Spirit his life
[1:28:19] in you working his own life through you
[1:28:21] and it's for the rich the poor and
[1:28:22] whosoever will receive receive it that's
[1:28:25] the token the token is the holy spirit
[1:28:27] it's the life of God in you now a little
[1:28:30] further down just a couple paragraphs
[1:28:32] lower he says now just not no certain
[1:28:35] evidence because he's still people are
[1:28:36] still questioning How Will I Know What's
[1:28:38] the evidence so not just no certain
[1:28:41] evidence you say brother bam I he goes I
[1:28:43] felt it in your mind you see why will we
[1:28:46] know look what you were and what you are
[1:28:50] amen there is how you know what was you
[1:28:53] before the token was applied what are
[1:28:55] you after it's applied what was your
[1:28:57] desire before and what is your desire
[1:28:59] after then you know whether the token is
[1:29:01] applied or not and these other things
[1:29:03] just automatically go with it what he's
[1:29:05] talking about he's talking about there
[1:29:06] was a change inside of you your desires
[1:29:09] your thinking your everything about you
[1:29:11] changed on the inside amen it may took a
[1:29:14] while for the outside to catch up with
[1:29:15] the inside but there was a change by the
[1:29:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost a new birth
[1:29:19] where the seed that could receive God's
[1:29:21] word sprung to life and changed you on
[1:29:24] the inside and your whole desire
[1:29:26] everything you wanted
[1:29:28] changed what were you before what were
[1:29:30] you after amen what was your desire
[1:29:32] before what was your desire after what
[1:29:34] is it that's the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:29:36] you that's the token that's the life
[1:29:38] that you present with your
[1:29:41] request that's what makes us ambassadors
[1:29:43] on this
[1:29:46] earth now brother B comes to the message
[1:29:48] The God Who is rich in Mercy this is
[1:29:51] from 1965 he said I'm only saying this
[1:29:54] not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten
[1:29:56] it out that we might get away from this
[1:29:59] fear and
[1:30:01] scare you don't know who you
[1:30:03] are you're not going to be but now you
[1:30:07] are the sons of God see you always were
[1:30:10] the sons of God God Amen brother B said
[1:30:14] he's trying to get over get us over a
[1:30:16] fear and a scare a fear that we won't
[1:30:18] make it or we're not good enough or
[1:30:20] we're trying to get over all of that
[1:30:22] it's not that you you've all always been
[1:30:24] Sons and Daughters of God you've just
[1:30:26] come to the realization of your position
[1:30:28] and who you really are
[1:30:31] amen so you don't know who you are so
[1:30:34] there there comes a power and an
[1:30:35] understanding a power that comes with
[1:30:37] understanding and positional
[1:30:40] placing he says for when God had you in
[1:30:43] his thinking at the beginning you have
[1:30:45] to be some part of you your life that's
[1:30:46] in you now had to be with God before
[1:30:49] there well then before he even become
[1:30:53] material here on the earth before there
[1:30:55] was anything but God you were one of his
[1:30:57] attributes you know what your name would
[1:30:59] be he know the color of hair you would
[1:31:01] have he knowed all about
[1:31:03] you he know I'd be placed on this Earth
[1:31:06] he knows what I would have to sacrifice
[1:31:08] he knows where I would go he knows who I
[1:31:10] would influence he knows all about my
[1:31:12] life amen and he knows whether I believe
[1:31:15] him or not and if he knows if I believe
[1:31:17] that he's a god that
[1:31:20] is
[1:31:22] amen and
[1:31:24] in the uh adoption message the first
[1:31:27] adoption message in 1960 brother man
[1:31:30] says this the Bible teaching is usually
[1:31:33] a little treacherous a little you know
[1:31:35] kind of walking out on thin ice we call
[1:31:37] it but we just feel that maybe at this
[1:31:39] point at this time it might be good to
[1:31:42] kind of bring the church to what I think
[1:31:44] a complete understanding positionally of
[1:31:46] what we are in Christ Jesus and
[1:31:48] sometimes I think that preaching is a
[1:31:49] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[1:31:51] brother beer that teaching goes beyond
[1:31:53] that a especially to the church now
[1:31:55] preaching usually catches The Sinner
[1:31:57] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:31:59] word but teaching places a man
[1:32:01] positionally what he is and we can never
[1:32:04] rightly be able to have faith until
[1:32:06] positionally we know what we are amen
[1:32:09] that's what this message has done for us
[1:32:11] it is positionally placed us brother
[1:32:13] brandham said I mean how many times did
[1:32:15] he come uh to the to the platform he
[1:32:17] said now I'm not preaching this morning
[1:32:18] I'm teaching a Sunday school lesson so
[1:32:20] that we'll get it he's trying to bring
[1:32:22] the teaching the understanding the
[1:32:24] positional placing of the Bride so that
[1:32:26] there's no more scare and toss to around
[1:32:28] but she can hold steady be an ambassador
[1:32:30] be an agent for God and understand who
[1:32:33] she is on this Earth and what God can do
[1:32:35] through
[1:32:38] her amen and not be scared and not be
[1:32:40] nervous and not back
[1:32:43] down and so that's what the teaching
[1:32:46] does is positionally placed what a man
[1:32:50] is and so some of the struggle we have
[1:32:53] as we we don't really fully realize what
[1:32:55] we
[1:32:56] are cuz if we realize what we were what
[1:33:00] we're here for amen it would be so much
[1:33:03] easier to
[1:33:04] sacrifice to give our lives to surrender
[1:33:08] all to stop trying to save ourselves and
[1:33:11] preserve our reputation and preserve our
[1:33:13] life and make it easier for ourselves we
[1:33:16] would understand I'm here I'm a
[1:33:18] continuation of the ministry of Jesus
[1:33:20] Christ and Christ came to give himself
[1:33:24] for Redemption and salvation and for the
[1:33:27] work of God I'm here to continue
[1:33:30] that let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:33:34] 7 now as I get into some things I just
[1:33:37] confess to you right up from the from
[1:33:39] the very beginning I don't really
[1:33:41] understand always how everything works I
[1:33:44] have ideas but my ideas are still stuck
[1:33:47] in a carnal human mind I can't explain
[1:33:50] to you some things but all I can do is
[1:33:52] point you to them and tell you that
[1:33:53] they're real amen 1 Corinthians 7:13
[1:33:58] says 1 Corinthians
[1:34:01] 7:13 and the woman which hath a husband
[1:34:04] that believeth not and if he be pleased
[1:34:06] to dwell with her let her not leave him
[1:34:08] for the unbelieving husband is
[1:34:10] Sanctified by the wife and the
[1:34:12] unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the
[1:34:14] husband else were your children unclean
[1:34:16] but now are they
[1:34:19] holy see brother Chad explain that to me
[1:34:22] I can't
[1:34:25] all I know is it's true amen all I know
[1:34:29] is that your position in Christ is
[1:34:31] actually covering for error covering for
[1:34:34] bad marit covering for your spouse
[1:34:36] because of who you are not because of
[1:34:38] who they are for the unbelieving spouse
[1:34:41] is Sanctified the unbelieving husband is
[1:34:43] Sanctified by the wife the unbelieving
[1:34:45] wife is Sanctified by the believing
[1:34:47] husband why because that believer has
[1:34:50] faith in a god that is Amen in their
[1:34:53] position in Christ is covering for a
[1:34:56] lack in the unbelieving spouse what all
[1:34:58] does that mean I don't know what does it
[1:35:00] mean in eternity I don't know I can't
[1:35:02] explain it I can't understand where how
[1:35:05] far that goes but I know one thing Amen
[1:35:08] in the Earthly Journey the believing
[1:35:10] wife is sanctifying the unbelieving
[1:35:12] husband why because she's a Believer
[1:35:14] it's her faith and her love that is
[1:35:16] doing something for the
[1:35:18] unbeliever because God works by faith
[1:35:21] and love Faith and love Faith and love
[1:35:24] oh praise God I have a million questions
[1:35:28] on that would that mean salvation would
[1:35:29] that mean that they can't be seed if
[1:35:31] they're not seed with I don't know don't
[1:35:33] ask me those questions I don't know why
[1:35:34] don't we all just believe God and keep
[1:35:36] pressing on and understand it truth and
[1:35:38] let God be a rewarder and find out in
[1:35:41] the end how good he is and how loving he
[1:35:43] is how gracious he
[1:35:46] is how understanding he
[1:35:49] is amen because those that come to God
[1:35:53] must believe that he is and a rewarder
[1:35:55] of those who diligently say it's
[1:35:57] important you have to understand that
[1:35:59] he's a rewarder or we can't live this
[1:36:01] life too many hazards too many
[1:36:04] heartbreaks too many disappointments too
[1:36:06] much
[1:36:08] sacrifice we have to know that he's a
[1:36:11] rewarder in the token message again he
[1:36:14] says get ready apply it it's talking
[1:36:16] about the token believe it clean up let

[1:37:23] that he's t talking about this

[1:37:31] kick out that and cause us to live holy
[1:37:33] and clean and righteous lives before the
[1:37:35] people and it'll create an atmosphere

[1:37:39] and then they know you're a Christian
[1:37:40] and they love for you to say something
[1:37:42] to them that means this atmosphere is

[1:38:01] of righteousness Holiness
[1:38:06] sanctity we apply this we believe that
[1:38:08] it's going to
[1:38:10] work why because I'm an agent for Jesus
[1:38:13] Christ I'm here for a reason I have to
[1:38:16] believe that the life in me is going to
[1:38:20] work they love for you to say something

[1:38:50] apply the token you have to believe that

[1:38:55] a mental exercise there's got to be
[1:38:57] something in you that believes I believe

[1:39:02] my family I believe with all my heart
[1:39:04] when I request because of who I am

[1:39:42] I'm standing here in the gap for this
[1:39:45] one and for that one and for that one
[1:39:46] would you move on their lives would you
[1:39:48] touch them would you change their
[1:39:50] lives this is the way we pray
[1:39:53] am brother said in the message absolute
[1:39:55] he's still the same Jehovah God that he
[1:39:57] always was we like the Apostle Paul can
[1:40:00] realize the same God lives today
[1:40:02] yesterday today forever the same then
[1:40:05] Christians can hold to God's unchanging
[1:40:07] hand and change the whole situation
[1:40:10] Prayer Changes Things amen why cuz
[1:40:12] you're an agent for change amen you're
[1:40:15] here for a reason to pray Amen to
[1:40:17] intercede to stand in the Gap Amen to be
[1:40:19] an ambassador for Christ because the
[1:40:21] word of reconciliation been given to
[1:40:25] you remember I want to draw your
[1:40:28] attention to something brother bam
[1:40:30] starts in the 60s I can't remember I
[1:40:32] should have checked the date when he had
[1:40:33] this experience of going beyond the
[1:40:35] curtain of time and when he has this
[1:40:36] experience and man I know it's 1960 or
[1:40:39] before and and then he comes out and he
[1:40:41] knows he's got a dog over there and he's
[1:40:43] got a horse over
[1:40:47] there and God said to
[1:40:50] him all that you ever loved and all that
[1:40:52] ever loved you you will be
[1:40:55] here is that what he
[1:41:01] said you know brother Brenham never
[1:41:03] stopped praying for his children and
[1:41:06] interceding and imploring God to change
[1:41:08] their
[1:41:11] lives that that what the angel of the
[1:41:14] Lord told him there what that voice told
[1:41:16] him did not take away his desperation
[1:41:20] for Souls
[1:41:23] did not give him a guarantee that would
[1:41:26] cause lethargy
[1:41:29] laziness you never saw that in the
[1:41:32] prophet you never saw him saying well
[1:41:35] God told me all that ever loved me
[1:41:37] listen in order for you to understand
[1:41:39] how that verse is applied you have to
[1:41:40] know what or not verse that statement
[1:41:42] you have to know what God means by
[1:41:44] everybody you love and everybody loves
[1:41:46] you and I'm not going to try to
[1:41:48] interpret that because I would have to
[1:41:49] get into the mind of God and know
[1:41:51] exactly what God meant with what he said
[1:41:52] but what whatever God meant is exactly
[1:41:54] what will happen but brother brandham
[1:41:57] never took it for granted he never took
[1:41:59] it for granted that his children would
[1:42:00] be saved he comes to the end of souls
[1:42:02] that are in prison now and he's
[1:42:03] wrestling with the fact that the lamb
[1:42:04] has taken the book and is Mercy over is
[1:42:06] there no more chance for mercy and and
[1:42:08] at the end he saying God don't let it be
[1:42:10] so it looks very much like it is but God
[1:42:13] I've got children that aren't saved God
[1:42:14] saved my Becky God saved Sarah God Sav
[1:42:17] what's he doing he's still interceding
[1:42:19] he's still imploring God he's not saying
[1:42:22] well God's a rewarder if I can have a a
[1:42:24] horse if I can have a dog I'll have my
[1:42:26] sons and daughters he never draws that
[1:42:28] conclusion amen he never he stays in
[1:42:30] desperation for Souls because love is
[1:42:33] projecting love is moving him to stand
[1:42:36] in the gap for his children till he
[1:42:37] knows that they're
[1:42:39] secure that's the problem if we preach a
[1:42:42] Doctrine like this and you preach it too
[1:42:44] hard one way amen all of the sudden you
[1:42:45] got all the parents doing nothing for
[1:42:47] their children interceding applying no
[1:42:49] token just saying will they all be there
[1:42:51] anyways amen you don't have a guarant of
[1:42:53] that you better get on your knees and
[1:42:55] use your position with God and say God
[1:42:57] I'm standing in the gap for my son and
[1:42:59] daughter I know you hear my prayers I
[1:43:01] know you answer I know you love me and
[1:43:03] God if you can give me what I want I
[1:43:06] love them so much would you would you
[1:43:08] save my son and
[1:43:11] daughter amen it matters the way we
[1:43:15] present
[1:43:17] truth because they asked brother
[1:43:19] brandham will every child of a Believer
[1:43:22] be saved sa and he said
[1:43:26] no when you hear that quote that's from
[1:43:29] 1964 when you hear that quote you can
[1:43:33] drop your head and say oh
[1:43:36] no but then you could see brother
[1:43:39] Brandon and the token says apply the
[1:43:41] token it'll take an effect on your
[1:43:42] children it'll take an effect claim your
[1:43:44] children claim your
[1:43:47] family get them under the token apply
[1:43:50] the token create an atmosphere they'll
[1:43:51] step into believe that it'll work that
[1:43:53] next time I talk to them it'll take an
[1:43:55] effect and then he says will every child
[1:43:58] of
[1:44:00] no you know what that should do to you
[1:44:02] and I it should create
[1:44:06] desperation if not every child of a
[1:44:08] Believer will be saved I'm going to
[1:44:10] stand in the Gap till mine are my
[1:44:12] children my family my loved ones the
[1:44:14] ones I care about if God's put me here
[1:44:17] as an ambassador and I've got the word
[1:44:18] of reconciliation and I've got the life
[1:44:20] of Jesus Christ I'm standing in the gap
[1:44:23] and I'm asking God who's a rewarder and
[1:44:25] knows how to give good gifts to those
[1:44:27] that ask I'm asking for my children my
[1:44:29] wife my loved ones whoever comes on my
[1:44:30] heart I'm not taking it for granted
[1:44:33] because desperation moves God
[1:44:35] desperation moves
[1:44:39] things and he said Christians can hold
[1:44:42] to God's unchanging hand and change the
[1:44:45] whole situation Prayer Changes Things
[1:44:49] you know what you are as an angent of
[1:44:50] God you're an agent of change you can
[1:44:52] change things on this Earth because of
[1:44:55] who you are you can change circumstances
[1:44:57] you can change attitudes you can change
[1:44:59] atmospheres because of who you are
[1:45:01] praise God Amen remember the life of
[1:45:04] Joseph Joseph amen was a little boy born
[1:45:07] for a season amen born for a purpose
[1:45:10] amen and as a young man he has a vision
[1:45:12] a series of two visions amen of dreams
[1:45:14] that he interprets and he tells them
[1:45:16] that this is going to be the the
[1:45:17] situation in the future all of you are
[1:45:19] going to bow down to me I mean that's
[1:45:22] putting it in
[1:45:24] shell they didn't like it they got upset
[1:45:26] they sold him in the slavery so now he's
[1:45:29] being taken by the moabites and moved on
[1:45:31] down to slavery and and things get bad
[1:45:33] for Joseph but the prophecy never
[1:45:37] changes who Joseph is never changes
[1:45:40] God's purpose for him never changes and
[1:45:43] what's inside of him never
[1:45:45] disappears regardless of the
[1:45:48] circumstance amen and he moves
[1:45:51] him from
[1:45:55] from Palestine from Canaan
[1:45:57] land down to Egypt and he becomes a
[1:46:00] slave purchased by
[1:46:03] Piper the gift in Joseph's life blesses
[1:46:07] everyone around
[1:46:09] him because he has the power within him
[1:46:12] to change
[1:46:13] things because he's a Son of God
[1:46:16] Amen he changes the atmosphere in
[1:46:19] Piper's house
[1:46:21] yeah he he he brings wealth and
[1:46:24] prosperity to
[1:46:25] Piper while he himself is in
[1:46:31] bondage because he was a Son of
[1:46:34] God there was an atmosphere around him
[1:46:37] there was a gift in his life and it was
[1:46:40] affecting wherever he
[1:46:42] was our workplaces should be different
[1:46:44] because we're there Hallelujah yes it
[1:46:48] should be different cuz we're there
[1:46:51] amen wherever we associate wherever we
[1:46:53] go it should be different cuz we're
[1:46:56] there our apartment complex should be
[1:46:58] different our neighborhood should be
[1:46:59] different our our stretch of the road
[1:47:01] should be the best
[1:47:03] amen yeah why cuz we're there praise God
[1:47:08] because a Christian holds the God's
[1:47:11] unchanging hand and can change the whole
[1:47:14] situation Prayer Changes Things see the
[1:47:17] problem is we don't have confidence in
[1:47:18] who we are yet but God's bringing us
[1:47:21] there
[1:47:23] Joseph now in Piper's house blessing
[1:47:26] potier to the to the point where potier
[1:47:28] doesn't even have a clue how much is in
[1:47:29] the bank Joseph set him up on allowance
[1:47:32] so he can go and have fun with his
[1:47:33] buddies and he's enjoying it Joseph is
[1:47:36] managing everything until parer's wife
[1:47:39] amen put comes up with a scheme and
[1:47:41] tries to have Joseph Joseph stays in his
[1:47:43] righteousness amen and he gets falsely
[1:47:47] accused falsely accused lied about and
[1:47:49] sent to a dungeon it just got worse for
[1:47:52] for him but Piper's house was
[1:47:56] blessed now he goes to the dungeon and
[1:47:59] guess what happens in the
[1:48:01] dungeon his presence changes the whole
[1:48:04] atmosphere in the
[1:48:06] prison until Piper was the luckiest man
[1:48:09] in all of Egypt now the Jailer is the
[1:48:12] luckiest man in all of because his life
[1:48:14] is a vacation Joseph is taking care of
[1:48:16] the
[1:48:19] prison and while he's down there he's
[1:48:21] interpreting dreams and he's he's
[1:48:23] serving the gift that is him is giving
[1:48:25] out giving out giving out giving out
[1:48:28] he's giving out in Piper's house he's
[1:48:30] giving out he was giving out in his
[1:48:32] father's house he's giving out in
[1:48:33] Piper's house he's giving out in the
[1:48:35] dungeon why because he's a child of God
[1:48:37] he can change the atmosphere he's got a
[1:48:39] power inside of him to change things who
[1:48:41] he is never changes by his circumstances
[1:48:43] or the location or the place where he's
[1:48:45] at can't stop the life that's on the
[1:48:47] inside of
[1:48:51] Joseph and so we have the story with the
[1:48:54] Butler and the Baker and then there's a
[1:48:56] promise and a betrayal of promise and a
[1:48:58] betrayal of trust because now whoever it
[1:49:01] was that was restored forgot all about
[1:49:03] Joseph he's left in the
[1:49:07] prison but you know what he is he's an
[1:49:10] agent wherever he
[1:49:12] goes it's good it's blessed it's
[1:49:16] better he's not better everything else
[1:49:19] is
[1:49:21] better remember brother brother brandham
[1:49:23] standing in the pull pit so weak he has
[1:49:25] to grip the pull pit to stand on his
[1:49:26] feet so sick he can't hardly stand but
[1:49:28] everybody coming through lines getting
[1:49:30] healed because the gift was to go out
[1:49:33] amen not for him and Joseph's gift was
[1:49:35] was changing circumstances all around
[1:49:37] him but his circumstance was getting
[1:49:40] worse listen we're not on this Earth for
[1:49:44] ourselves we're here as
[1:49:46] ambassadors agents for change
[1:49:51] amen but God is a
[1:49:54] rewarder and God never forgot where
[1:49:56] Joseph was and what Joseph went through
[1:50:00] and what Joseph sacrificed and who
[1:50:02] Joseph
[1:50:03] loved because at the end of the story he
[1:50:05] gets taken right to the place that he
[1:50:07] was destined to go to the right hand of
[1:50:09] pharaoh and what does God give him he
[1:50:11] gives him his whole family
[1:50:14] back
[1:50:16] god listen sometimes we just don't know
[1:50:19] who we
[1:50:20] are we have to recognize who we
[1:50:24] are let's go to John chapter
[1:50:27] 15 let's just read a couple more
[1:50:29] scriptures as we wind down
[1:50:42] here John chapter 15:
[1:50:47] 16 says you have not chosen me but I
[1:50:50] have chosen you and ordained you that
[1:50:52] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[1:50:54] that your fruit should remain that
[1:50:56] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:50:58] in my name he may give it to
[1:51:02] you that's a promise
[1:51:05] yes I need to
[1:51:07] ask I have the power to change
[1:51:10] situations because he promised me verse
[1:51:16] 23 uh chapter 16 sorry chapter 16 verse
[1:51:20] 23
[1:51:24] in chapter 16: 23 he says and in that
[1:51:27] day he shall ask me nothing verily
[1:51:29] verily I say unto you whatsoever ye
[1:51:32] shall ask the father in my name he will
[1:51:35] give it you hither to have you asked
[1:51:37] nothing in my name ask and you shall
[1:51:39] receive that your joy may be full anden
[1:51:43] when you ask to receive that your joy
[1:51:45] may be full you have to actually believe
[1:51:46] you're going to receive what you ask if
[1:51:49] you don't believe what you're going to
[1:51:50] receive what you ask then don't start
[1:51:51] asking don't start asking till you start
[1:51:53] believing and when you believe apply the
[1:51:55] token in prayer and believe that God I'm
[1:51:58] here serving your purpose I believe you
[1:52:00] with all of my heart I've surrendered to
[1:52:01] your word and I've given up everything
[1:52:03] to follow after you and you promised
[1:52:05] even the disciples if they give up
[1:52:07] houses and lands and homes and spouses
[1:52:09] and children that you'll give back to
[1:52:11] them in this life and the life to come
[1:52:13] and God I have sacrificed for you God
[1:52:15] would you hear my request and save my
[1:52:17] friend save my child work in my
[1:52:20] life praise God we have the power to
[1:52:23] make
[1:52:24] changes and let's go to James chapter 5
[1:52:32] now James chapter
[1:52:41] 5 James chapter 5:1
[1:52:46] 16 he said confess your faults one to
[1:52:49] another and pray one for another that
[1:52:52] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:52:55] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:52:59] this isn't lazy prayer this isn't
[1:53:01] half-hearted prayer this is the
[1:53:02] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:53:04] man availeth much we have to know who we
[1:53:07] are and then we have to go to labor in
[1:53:09] prayer to move things we have to believe
[1:53:12] that our prayer will move things we have
[1:53:14] to believe that the life inside of us we
[1:53:16] can project back to God and we can have
[1:53:18] what we request and we have to labor we
[1:53:20] have to we have to believe we have to
[1:53:22] stand on the promise and move things on
[1:53:24] earth amen by believing the word of God
[1:53:27] and the message the token I'm going back
[1:53:29] to the Token he says what does he do
[1:53:31] then when you you can present the token
[1:53:34] with your prayer it shows that you are
[1:53:35] fully come to obedience to the whole
[1:53:37] word of God when you've got the token it
[1:53:39] shows that you have obeyed every word
[1:53:41] then you and the word are
[1:53:44] one you're only asking for the thing
[1:53:47] that you are amen
[1:53:50] God Amen this this is understanding our
[1:53:53] position I I I'm just here I'm as a
[1:53:56] partner with you God but as a partner
[1:53:59] you said you have no eyes but my eyes no
[1:54:01] ears but my ears no mouth but my mouth
[1:54:04] when you told the disciples look onto
[1:54:06] the Harvest see that is a need pray to
[1:54:07] the Lord of the Harvest to sin and meet
[1:54:09] the need well if he has no eyes but mine
[1:54:12] no ears but mine no mouth but mine who's
[1:54:15] supposed to see the need who's supposed
[1:54:17] to hear the need then who's supposed to
[1:54:19] ask for the need to be met that's my job
[1:54:22] as an agent on the earth I have to see
[1:54:24] the need I have to hear the need then I
[1:54:26] have to ask the lord of the Harvest
[1:54:28] would you please come and meet this need
[1:54:31] Hallelujah he's he's got to have
[1:54:33] somebody on the earth as the ACT an
[1:54:36] agent to move heaven to change things on
[1:54:40] earth
[1:54:43] amen you're you're only asking for the
[1:54:46] thing that you are if you say this hand
[1:54:48] you obey me reach out for that
[1:54:50] handkerchief now brother R's going to
[1:54:51] give us some good instruction here reach
[1:54:53] out for that handkerchief it does it see
[1:54:55] hand obey me why it's part of me then
[1:54:58] when you and the word becomes one every
[1:55:01] promise glory to God every promise is
[1:55:03] yours it obeys you then you want to
[1:55:07] watch what you want to
[1:55:09] do now he's going to give us a word of
[1:55:12] caution because of the power that's
[1:55:14] inherent
[1:55:15] here he said you wouldn't put your hand
[1:55:18] in a fire just to say see me do it
[1:55:23] oh no no see but if there is something
[1:55:26] in that fire I got to reach for it'll
[1:55:28] obey me
[1:55:30] amen see that's right see you want to
[1:55:34] watch what you're doing that's the
[1:55:36] reason the Holy Spirit listen that's the
[1:55:39] reason the Holy Spirit sparingly give
[1:55:42] out and things you know what I mean CU
[1:55:44] you don't a real servant of God don't
[1:55:46] show off with it you see that's making a
[1:55:50] show this isn't about making show I did
[1:55:53] this and I prayed and they moved and
[1:55:54] this that's not it at all it's
[1:55:56] understanding who you are and saying God
[1:55:58] you said if we'll see if we'll ask if
[1:56:00] we'll and intercede and God I'm coming
[1:56:02] to the position you put me in an earth
[1:56:04] you need an agent I'm willing to be that
[1:56:06] agent amen and I'm asking that you
[1:56:08] change this circumstance you heal my
[1:56:10] neighbor you heal my friend you heal my
[1:56:12] mother you heal my father you open their
[1:56:14] eyes because you need somebody to ask
[1:56:17] and I'll be that somebody to
[1:56:19] ask amen
[1:56:22] let's go to acts
[1:56:31] 27 I preached on this once several years
[1:56:33] ago I used this example but I want to
[1:56:35] bring it fresh to your mind and memory
[1:56:38] again because it's such a powerful
[1:56:40] example of what I'm trying to
[1:56:43] say in Acts chapter
[1:56:47] 27
[1:56:49] Paul and his Shipmates are on a journey
[1:56:52] he's a prisoner on a prison
[1:56:54] ship uh going to Rome but they're in a
[1:56:57] storm and the storm has lasted a long
[1:56:59] time and they Des sparing of life and
[1:57:00] throwing out the tackle the light in the
[1:57:02] ship and they're having all kinds of
[1:57:04] trouble but Paul's on the
[1:57:09] boat all kinds of issues all kinds of
[1:57:11] trouble but there's a Son of God on the
[1:57:15] boat and let's look at uh verse
[1:57:19] 20 and when neither son nor stars and
[1:57:22] many days appeared and no small Tempest
[1:57:24] lay on us all hope that we should be
[1:57:27] saved was then taken away there wasn't a
[1:57:30] hope that they were going to make it the
[1:57:33] only hope was an agent amen praise God
[1:57:38] Amen it says now verse 21 but after a
[1:57:41] long abstinence Paul stood forth in the
[1:57:44] midst of them and said s you should have
[1:57:47] hearkened unto me and not have loosed
[1:57:49] from CRE and to have gained this harm
[1:57:51] and LA
[1:57:53] and now I exhort you to be of good cheer
[1:57:55] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:57:57] life among you but of the ship for there
[1:58:00] stood by me this night the angel of God
[1:58:03] whose I am and whom I serve saying fear
[1:58:06] not Paul thou must be brought before
[1:58:08] Caesar and lo God hath given thee all
[1:58:11] them that sail with
[1:58:13] thee wherefore sir be of good cheer for
[1:58:16] I believe God that it shall be even as
[1:58:20] it was told me Hallelujah he never
[1:58:23] required they believe God but he said
[1:58:25] you be of good cheer because I believe
[1:58:27] God and I believe because of faith faith
[1:58:29] will bring this to pass and because I
[1:58:31] believe God there'll be no loss of life
[1:58:34] only of the ship don't worry I
[1:58:38] believe praise God it says now listen
[1:58:42] the the angel of the Lord said Don't
[1:58:43] Fear because th have to go to Caesar the
[1:58:46] Apostle Paul already knew he was going
[1:58:48] to stand before Caesar God had already
[1:58:50] told him when he was arrested early on
[1:58:51] in his arrest that he had to go to
[1:58:53] appear before Caesar so he was on this
[1:58:55] journey to go to appear before Caesar
[1:58:57] the Apostle Paul believed the word of
[1:58:59] God he knew the prophecy was true if he
[1:59:02] was going to go see Caesar he was going
[1:59:04] to go see Caesar regardless of what
[1:59:06] happened to the ship but he was away in
[1:59:08] a long abstinence the Bible says he was
[1:59:10] hidden away where was he I'll tell you
[1:59:13] what I believe amen this is me I believe
[1:59:15] he was praying a prayer of intercession
[1:59:17] for everybody else on that boat because
[1:59:19] look at the answer he got don't be any
[1:59:22] fear for surely you're going to go to
[1:59:24] see Caesar but I have given you all the
[1:59:27] souls that are on this ship who did he
[1:59:29] give them to he gave him to an agent
[1:59:31] that was on the earth standing in the
[1:59:32] Gap a Son of God that was going to go to
[1:59:35] Caesar anyways he had no doubt he was
[1:59:37] going to go to Caesar so what's he need
[1:59:40] he he's saying God what about all these
[1:59:42] Souls on this boat what about all of
[1:59:44] these lives and he says I've given them
[1:59:46] to you
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:49] hallelujah amen
[1:59:52] what would have happened to that ship if
[1:59:54] Paul wasn't on that
[1:59:57] ship what would happened to those lives
[1:59:59] if Paul hadn't interceded for those
[2:00:02] lives and what would happen to all the
[2:00:04] people around us if there's not an agent
[2:00:06] on earth right in their midst in your
[2:00:08] workplace and in your family am mean
[2:00:10] they may not be seen they may never be
[2:00:12] able to receive the message but my can
[2:00:15] you bring healing to their life amen can
[2:00:17] you bring comfort and peace to them can
[2:00:19] they be preserved in time of sickness
[2:00:21] all of these people on this boat most of
[2:00:23] them were prisoners I doubt all of them
[2:00:25] were C Gene of God Amen but their life
[2:00:27] was saved from that shipwreck because
[2:00:29] there was somebody standing in the gap
[2:00:31] for

[2:00:44] more people than just the
[2:00:46] elect and I believe Jesus healed more
[2:00:48] people than just the elect what should
[2:00:51] we be doing on this
[2:00:55] Earth if people can't
[2:00:58] find help from you and I where are they
[2:01:01] going to find
[2:01:02] it if they can't have an advocate in you
[2:01:05] and I who will advocate for them if
[2:01:08] somebody if we won't stand in the Gap
[2:01:10] who
[2:01:16] will what does it mean it means we have
[2:01:19] to
[2:01:20] give and give again in amen and give
[2:01:23] some more amen and engage in love and
[2:01:28] sacrifice amen and give even when your
[2:01:32] act of Love isn't received In
[2:01:36] Love sometimes it's received in
[2:01:37] hostility or misunderstanding or mocking
[2:01:40] but it doesn't matter God loved
[2:01:44] anyways somebody's got to stand in the
[2:01:46] Gap somebody's got to be an Agent of
[2:01:49] Change Jesus Christ must be on Earth
[2:01:53] again in the form of his
[2:01:58] bride in the message expectation brother
[2:02:01] V said prayer is the
[2:02:03] key that's the answer Prayer Changes
[2:02:06] Things prayer is the most powerful
[2:02:08] weapon that was ever put in control of
[2:02:10] human beings there's no atomic bomb or
[2:02:13] no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[2:02:15] prayer will change the mind of God
[2:02:20] amen amen I I listen I don't want to get
[2:02:23] so locked down Amen in in predestination
[2:02:27] that we don't realize that part of God's
[2:02:29] predestinated plan is to have people on
[2:02:30] the Earth that will intercede for others
[2:02:32] and change things on the earth and be
[2:02:34] amateur Gods on this Earth agents of God
[2:02:37] that can affect the change around them
[2:02:38] because of who they are and who's living
[2:02:40] on the inside of
[2:02:42] them too many times with an
[2:02:45] understanding that God listen and it's
[2:02:47] the absolute truth we understand that
[2:02:49] God knew every Gat that would fly on
[2:02:51] this Earth and and how many times it
[2:02:53] would bat its wings and how much Tallow
[2:02:54] it would
[2:02:56] generate that's the absolute
[2:02:58] truth but he also knew how much trouble
[2:03:01] and struggle would be on this earth and
[2:03:02] the heartache that sin would cause and
[2:03:04] he also knew who would be his agents and
[2:03:06] what they would do to represent him on
[2:03:08] the Earth We're his representation amen
[2:03:10] we're here for healing and for life and
[2:03:12] for
[2:03:14] changes not to sit on our Lazy Boy and
[2:03:16] then our sofa is saying oh it's all
[2:03:18] worked out already yeah it's all worked
[2:03:20] out in the mind of all already the mind
[2:03:22] of God has little Gods on this Earth
[2:03:24] that are making changes little gods that
[2:03:26] are taking Dominion amateur Gods little
[2:03:28] messes that are here affecting the lives
[2:03:31] of the people around them that are
[2:03:32] loving so that he can move amen that are
[2:03:34] projecting love so Grace can take its
[2:03:37] place he knew he'd have an army of
[2:03:42] messes praise God
[2:03:46] Amen who would stand in the Gap who
[2:03:49] would give again who would be rejected
[2:03:52] and spit upon and ridicule but not
[2:03:53] ridicule back not spit
[2:03:56] back amen that's why he said you pray to
[2:04:00] the Lord of the
[2:04:01] Harvest you pray yeah I mean can you
[2:04:05] imag sitting there well you're the lord
[2:04:06] of the Harvest you already know what do
[2:04:08] I need to pray
[2:04:09] for you pray do to the lord of the
[2:04:15] Harvest prise god let's turn to John 17
[2:04:22] thank
[2:04:23] you how many of you believe that Jesus
[2:04:26] would L by Vision oh yes
[2:04:30] amen you know brother B dramatizes
[2:04:32] things for us to bring it into
[2:04:33] perspective so that we understand said
[2:04:36] the vision led him to the pool of
[2:04:37] Bethesda one day where they were sick
[2:04:39] and INF and infirmed all around the pool
[2:04:41] of
[2:04:42] Bethesda they were waiting it was the
[2:04:44] season where the angel would come down
[2:04:46] and Trouble the waters and the first one
[2:04:47] in would be healed so there was a great
[2:04:49] mob there with anticipation because they
[2:04:51] all wanted to be healed but God led by
[2:04:53] vision and God LED Jesus to one man so
[2:04:56] he had to step around and step over and
[2:04:58] walk through a crowd of sick to go and
[2:05:00] heal one person and when he healed that
[2:05:03] person he didn't even really pray for
[2:05:05] them he said would you be well yeah take
[2:05:08] up your bed and walk am yeah brother bam
[2:05:11] said and and when you have a vision you
[2:05:13] don't even need to pray it's finished
[2:05:15] just declare
[2:05:17] it but if you watch the gospels Jesus
[2:05:20] was all the time
[2:05:23] praying he was
[2:05:25] praying Jesus who was godm made flesh
[2:05:28] who knowed all things was led by Vision
[2:05:31] he was asking God for
[2:05:33] things not just saying well I'll just
[2:05:36] wait here for God give me a vision when
[2:05:37] I get Vision I'll go and do
[2:05:39] it but he was an example to you and I he
[2:05:42] was the god man and when he was on Earth
[2:05:45] you know what he was doing he was
[2:05:46] interceding he was praying he was asking
[2:05:49] the father to do things
[2:05:53] John 17:8 is one of
[2:05:57] those he
[2:06:00] says 17:8 he says for I have given unto
[2:06:04] them The Words which thou gavest me he's
[2:06:07] praying to God and they have received
[2:06:10] them and have known surely that I come
[2:06:12] from thee and they have believed that
[2:06:14] thou did send me I pray for them amen I
[2:06:18] pray not for the world but for them
[2:06:20] which thou has given me for they are
[2:06:22] thine and all mine are thine and thine
[2:06:24] are mine and I am glorified in them and
[2:06:28] now I am no more in the world but these
[2:06:30] are in the world and I come to thee Holy
[2:06:32] Father keep through thine own name those
[2:06:35] which thou Hast given me that they may
[2:06:37] be one as we are
[2:06:41] one listen Jesus knows all things right
[2:06:45] and he knows God has put all things in
[2:06:46] his hand but Jesus doesn't sit back and
[2:06:49] say the father's got it all figured out
[2:06:50] before time all have to do is go through
[2:06:52] the motion no Jesus is saying father
[2:06:54] would you keep them I love them what
[2:06:57] what is moving Jesus to pray this prayer
[2:07:00] because of his love for his disciples is
[2:07:02] causing him to stand in the gap between
[2:07:04] him and the father and saying father
[2:07:06] would you keep them through thy love
[2:07:08] keep them Lord I'm leaving but they have
[2:07:10] to stay would you keep them what is
[2:07:12] moving him faith and
[2:07:15] love praise God let's look at verse 24
[2:07:18] now
[2:07:22] he said father I will that they also
[2:07:25] whom thou has given me be with me where
[2:07:27] I am that they may behold my glory which
[2:07:30] thou Hast given me for thou lovest me
[2:07:32] before the foundation of the world
[2:07:34] what's he praying for he's saying
[2:07:37] God I want these disciples to be with
[2:07:41] me I want them to be my
[2:07:44] reward I want them I want these to be
[2:07:48] with me he's asking the father father
[2:07:52] for their for them to be with him
[2:07:54] wherever he
[2:07:56] is Luke
[2:07:58] 22 let's turn that let's turn there real
[2:08:00] quick Luke chapter
[2:08:07] 22 see friends this isn't taking
[2:08:10] something for
[2:08:12] granted this isn't just letting whatever
[2:08:14] happens happens this is understanding
[2:08:17] who we are and why we're here and what
[2:08:21] life is in us and what power resides in
[2:08:23] us and what promises have been given to
[2:08:25] us and if God has put his life in me and
[2:08:27] God has promised that he'll hear my
[2:08:29] prayer and God has told me to ask in in
[2:08:31] his name so that my joy might be full
[2:08:33] then when I see and I hear and I love
[2:08:36] and I want why can't I go into
[2:08:38] intercession and say God would you just
[2:08:40] save my brother save my sister save my
[2:08:42] mom save my dad heal my coworker would
[2:08:45] you help us in our company Lord I know
[2:08:47] all of these people and they've got kids
[2:08:49] they're supporting if we lose this
[2:08:51] contract amen there's going to be
[2:08:53] suffering God would you help us to win
[2:08:55] this contract for the sake of all my
[2:08:59] friends remember wherever Joseph
[2:09:04] was he affected everything around him
[2:09:07] our lives should have an effect Amen on
[2:09:10] the places we work the places we go the
[2:09:12] associations we're
[2:09:16] in Luke
[2:09:18] 22 verse 31
[2:09:23] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[2:09:26] Satan hath desired to have you that he
[2:09:28] may sift you as wheat but I have prayed
[2:09:32] for thee Hallelujah that thy faith fail
[2:09:35] not and when th are converted strengthen
[2:09:38] the
[2:09:38] Brethren I can't tell you what that
[2:09:41] scripture does to me right
[2:09:43] now Jesus didn't say Peter you're going
[2:09:47] to be sifted by wheat but I've already
[2:09:49] seen it in a vision don't worry you got
[2:09:50] it
[2:09:52] you got
[2:09:54] this no Satan is desired to sift You by
[2:09:57] weat but I have prayed for
[2:10:01] you that your faith fail
[2:10:05] not if Jesus didn't take these things
[2:10:08] for granted should
[2:10:09] we if he injected himself into the
[2:10:12] situation and he stood in the Gap and he
[2:10:15] asked the fathers to preserve his
[2:10:17] disciples shouldn't we if he asked God
[2:10:21] to keep Peter's Faith from failing
[2:10:23] shouldn't
[2:10:25] we we shouldn't sit back and say well
[2:10:27] it's all going to be what it's going to
[2:10:28] be no no no it's going to be whatever we
[2:10:31] make it because that's the way God
[2:10:32] ordained it because God put us here to
[2:10:34] make changes God put us here to affect
[2:10:37] change to bring change to do to make
[2:10:39] things go in a different direction
[2:10:41] that's how God does it that's how he
[2:10:43] foresaw it he foresaw it because he had
[2:10:45] sons and daughters on the earth just
[2:10:47] like Joseph was there amen just like
[2:10:49] Abraham was there just like Paul was on
[2:10:51] that ship and you and I are here amen
[2:10:56] amen now I don't suggest you go to work
[2:10:59] Monday and say I'm
[2:11:05] here they may never fully comprehend in
[2:11:08] their lives what you being there means
[2:11:10] for
[2:11:12] them but someday they might find out
[2:11:15] just how critical it
[2:11:18] was and I don't want to miss my opport
[2:11:22] opportunity now brother R's going to say
[2:11:25] a statement and this statement is going
[2:11:27] to seemingly contradict the statement he
[2:11:30] just made that we just read he says 1960
[2:11:34] from that
[2:11:35] time but I'll tell you a little secret
[2:11:38] the most powerful force in the world
[2:11:40] isn't speaking with tongues or
[2:11:42] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[2:11:44] God to be a minister or to be an
[2:11:45] evangelist or to be a prophet the most
[2:11:48] powerful weapon that I've ever found in
[2:11:50] my life is love
[2:11:54] am what was the contradictory statement
[2:11:56] because before he said the most powerful
[2:11:57] weapon that's ever put in the hands of
[2:11:59] man is
[2:12:00] prayer but what motivates prayer is
[2:12:06] love and when you take Faith and love
[2:12:10] and you put it together in prayer that
[2:12:14] changes
[2:12:15] [Applause]
[2:12:17] things why are we who we are and why are
[2:12:20] we where we
[2:12:22] are maybe to bring a
[2:12:26] change we've quoted this several times
[2:12:28] but I'm just going to read to you out of
[2:12:29] 1 John 4 beloved let us love one another
[2:12:32] for love is of God and everyone that
[2:12:34] loveth is born of God and knoweth God he
[2:12:37] that loveth not knoweth not God for God
[2:12:40] is
[2:12:43] love let's go to Galatians 5 and I'm
[2:12:45] going to end with this verse in
[2:12:47] Galatians 5 it'll be our last verse we
[2:12:49] read
[2:13:01] Galatians
[2:13:02] 5 and
[2:13:10] 6 Galatians 5 and 6 for in Jesus Christ
[2:13:13] neither circumcision availeth anything
[2:13:15] nor
[2:13:16] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[2:13:19] by love
[2:13:21] how does faith work by
[2:13:25] love what availeth much faith that
[2:13:28] worketh by love brother Ben said in
[2:13:31] desperations he said I believe that the
[2:13:33] reason we don't have desperation is
[2:13:35] because it's a lack of
[2:13:37] love God the love of
[2:13:39] God when we take the
[2:13:42] attitude uh all that you ever loved and
[2:13:45] all that ever loved you will be there no
[2:13:48] desperation but said that actually shows
[2:13:50] a lack of
[2:13:52] love but because brother B loved his
[2:13:54] children after he heard a declaration
[2:13:56] like that in the sixth Dimension after
[2:13:57] he loved his children he's saying oh God
[2:13:59] in desperation oh God save my Becky save
[2:14:03] my Sarah save little Joseph Lord I want
[2:14:05] to see them filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:14:07] God please don't let me lose my children
[2:14:10] what's he doing what's causing
[2:14:12] desperation love amen because of love he
[2:14:15] has desperation he can't stand the
[2:14:18] thought of them not being there he can't
[2:14:19] stand the thought of them not being save
[2:14:21] not loving the Lord not serving God so
[2:14:23] he as a father as a Son of God Is
[2:14:27] Standing There imploring God God saved
[2:14:29] my Becky God saved my Sarah God saved
[2:14:31] Joseph oh my how can we sit idly by as
[2:14:35] the world is Fading Into ruin and say
[2:14:37] well whoever's supposed to be there but
[2:14:38] no I'm here to infect the change amen
[2:14:41] God change the situation around me
[2:14:43] change the situation with that person
[2:14:45] and that person and that person cuz
[2:14:47] you've put me here for a reason
[2:14:51] and you told me to ask that my joy might
[2:14:53] be full and now I'm coming to you with
[2:14:55] my token saying
[2:14:57] God save my Becky save my
[2:15:01] Joseph why cuz love brings
[2:15:07] desperation Jesus when he was going to
[2:15:09] Calvary the last moments on Earth just
[2:15:12] before he goes to Calvary he's saying
[2:15:15] father keep
[2:15:17] them I'm leaving them keep them
[2:15:21] do you think Jesus doubted God's ability
[2:15:24] to keep
[2:15:25] them what was being expressed in his cry
[2:15:28] his
[2:15:37] love the reason we don't have
[2:15:39] desperation because it's a lack of
[2:15:41] love the love of
[2:15:44] God I think that the love of God causes
[2:15:47] desperation if God is in you the token
[2:15:49] inside of you and you see the condition
[2:15:51] of the times and the people waiting in
[2:15:53] sin the way they are it will throw you
[2:15:55] into desperation I believe it will now
[2:15:58] the world the word plainly states if if
[2:16:02] you want to put it down as Galatians 5:6
[2:16:04] is what we just read Faith worketh by
[2:16:06] love see Faith worketh by love and the
[2:16:09] only way that you can have faith is to
[2:16:10] have love first because after all faith
[2:16:12] is Love's incentive incentive that's
[2:16:15] exactly what faith is it's an incentive
[2:16:17] to love now if you don't have love you
[2:16:20] can't have
[2:16:23] Faith how did God save hady r two boys
[2:16:27] by faith and love when they came
[2:16:31] together how did he save all those
[2:16:33] people on the
[2:16:34] ship with Paul faith and
[2:16:39] love how did he save Fritz and
[2:16:44] Prince faith and love how did he save
[2:16:49] Lot Faith and love amen how did he save
[2:16:52] rahab's Family Faith and love and how
[2:16:56] will he save the ones we love Faith and
[2:17:00] love they work together and as they work
[2:17:03] together they create
[2:17:05] desperation because we know that prayer
[2:17:08] changes things we know we can intercede
[2:17:12] we know we have the ministry of
[2:17:13] reconciliation we know where Christ is
[2:17:16] we know we have the token we know we
[2:17:18] have an access to God we know we can ask
[2:17:21] for whatsoever we want and it'll be
[2:17:22] given to us we know that he hears our
[2:17:24] prayer that puts us in
[2:17:26] desperation because we know we can ask
[2:17:30] we know we can pray and we love and
[2:17:34] believe and when those two come together
[2:17:36] it brings a desperation in us to stand
[2:17:38] in the Gap to intercede to
[2:17:48] love I just want to leave you with this
[2:17:50] thought
[2:17:51] and please don't ever believe on I'm
[2:17:55] drawing conclusions don't go farther
[2:17:56] than what the prophet did with these
[2:17:57] things cuz sometimes I don't know how to
[2:17:59] extrapolate these thoughts out I only
[2:18:01] know that they're
[2:18:03] true the only reason the sixth Dimension
[2:18:07] contains a horse named prince and a dog
[2:18:10] named frce is because a Son of God loved
[2:18:19] them it's the only reason they're there
[2:18:21] as far as my understanding is I can
[2:18:23] learn more tomorrow I may be wrong from
[2:18:26] the way I see
[2:18:27] it the only reason that there's a horse
[2:18:31] named prince and a dog dog not just
[2:18:34] a dog a dog named Fritz in the
[2:18:38] sixth
[2:18:39] Dimension is because a Son of God loved
[2:18:45] them I don't know what all that means in
[2:18:48] in all ways that that applies and how to
[2:18:51] extrapolate that I don't know but I do
[2:18:54] know one thing I'm a Son of
[2:18:56] God and I
[2:18:58] love and I believe he's a rewarder of
[2:19:02] those that diligently seek
[2:19:04] him I don't know how to sort it all out
[2:19:07] I don't know how I don't know what but I
[2:19:10] know this if prayer can change things
[2:19:13] I'm going to pray amen and if I have the
[2:19:15] token and it must be presented with my
[2:19:17] prayer then I'm going to present my
[2:19:18] token and I'm going to pray and if I can
[2:19:20] intercede I'm going to intercede if I
[2:19:22] have the ministry of reconciliation I'm
[2:19:24] going to practice the ministry of
[2:19:27] reconciliation I don't know how
[2:19:29] everything will work out but I know who
[2:19:30] I am I don't know how God will sort it
[2:19:33] all out but I know who I am and I know I
[2:19:36] know one thing's for sure if I can be
[2:19:39] his agent and sacrifice my life and give
[2:19:41] myself to him and do what he's called me
[2:19:43] to do I know beyond a shadow of doubt
[2:19:45] that I believe he's a rewarder of those
[2:19:49] that diligently seek him I know that for
[2:19:53] a fact can't tell you what it all looks
[2:19:56] like for sure and how it will all be
[2:19:58] meet out but I know it'll be meet out
[2:20:02] perfectly and I know one
[2:20:05] thing when brother bandam got to the
[2:20:08] sixth Dimension he was pleasantly
[2:20:12] surprised and I just pray that someday
[2:20:15] I'm pleasantly surprised and you're
[2:20:18] pleasantly surprised because faith and
[2:20:21] love work together to bring a
[2:20:25] change man let's all stand
[2:20:32] together there's so many things that we
[2:20:35] see in the scripture and that we see in
[2:20:37] the message that are so absolutely
[2:20:39] profound I don't know how to sort them
[2:20:42] out intellectually I don't know how to
[2:20:43] categorize them I don't but when you see
[2:20:47] the potential it moves you into
[2:20:49] desperation
[2:20:50] if you can do that for Paul you can do
[2:20:52] that for me if you can do that for Rahab
[2:20:54] you can do that for me if you can do
[2:20:56] that for Abraham you can do that for
[2:20:59] me and it moves us into desperation
[2:21:02] saying God I've seen you do it you can
[2:21:04] do it if you can do that for brother bam
[2:21:06] you can do it for me God do it for
[2:21:10] me amen and we must
[2:21:14] believe we must believe that he hears
[2:21:18] our prayer and we must believe that'll
[2:21:21] answer our prayer because of who we are
[2:21:24] because it's faith that moves things man
[2:21:27] God bless you all I I hope I pray that
[2:21:31] God will take what's I've done my best
[2:21:33] to present and he puts it together the
[2:21:35] right way I pray that he sorts it all
[2:21:37] out because it can leave a lot of holes
[2:21:39] and gaps and understanding because I
[2:21:40] have holes and gaps and understanding
[2:21:42] but I pray that God comes and starts to
[2:21:44] line it up and show you that in you and
[2:21:46] around your life is potential for change
[2:21:50] that you're an agent for Change and that
[2:21:51] God's put you here for that Amen to
[2:21:54] affect change to pray to intercede to
[2:21:57] move things around you for the grace of
[2:22:00] God Amen God bless you let's just bow
[2:22:03] our heads together and
[2:22:05] pray de heavenly father I thank you
[2:22:09] God God as you continually taking the
[2:22:12] veil off of who we really are God it
[2:22:15] comes off layer by
[2:22:17] layer Lord there's been so much darkness
[2:22:20] in our mind minds and in our lives
[2:22:22] because of lies because of natural
[2:22:25] things because of environment and
[2:22:27] education and our
[2:22:30] upbringing but God you're taking your
[2:22:32] word and you're peeling away layer upon
[2:22:34] layer to show us who we really
[2:22:37] are God we're not great because we're
[2:22:40] great
[2:22:41] people we're not anything in the flesh
[2:22:45] because we're just common flesh human
[2:22:49] beings
[2:22:51] it's not the flesh we're talking about
[2:22:54] that has to be
[2:22:55] changed but God way down in our souls
[2:22:58] you've planted a seed before the
[2:23:00] foundation of the world and that seed is
[2:23:04] our true identity who we really
[2:23:07] are and Lord by your grace you've
[2:23:09] brought that seed to Life by the washing
[2:23:12] of the water the word and the outpouring
[2:23:14] of your Holy Spirit you've quickened
[2:23:16] that seed to life and that life is
[2:23:18] taking over our life and you from the
[2:23:21] inside growing
[2:23:23] out God now we realize that what we saw
[2:23:27] in the mirror wasn't all there was to
[2:23:29] the
[2:23:30] story what was on our birth record
[2:23:32] wasn't all of our
[2:23:35] history but God you've put us here for a
[2:23:37] season and for a
[2:23:40] purpose you've poured your life into
[2:23:42] ours so that we can be your agents on
[2:23:45] this
[2:23:46] Earth you showed it through Paul through
[2:23:49] Peter and through James through John we
[2:23:52] saw in Abraham Lord we saw it in Jacob
[2:23:56] we saw it in Rahab we saw it in all of
[2:23:59] these how you change circumstances we
[2:24:02] saw in Daniel when he prayed it moved
[2:24:06] Heaven God if you've called us in the
[2:24:09] same line that you've called them then
[2:24:12] the same power resides within us Lord to
[2:24:15] change things to bring about your
[2:24:17] purpose on this Earth to see that things
[2:24:19] move in accordance with your word God
[2:24:22] you've put people in our lives and
[2:24:23] you've given us love for them your love
[2:24:25] not just a human emotion but something
[2:24:27] deeper than that because you want us to
[2:24:30] bring the change you want us to pray the
[2:24:33] prayer you want us to live the life you
[2:24:37] want us to intercede you want us to
[2:24:40] stand in the Gap God help us not to miss
[2:24:43] our opportunities and to understand what
[2:24:45] a power you've placed in our
[2:24:47] hands Lord your Prophet told us the most
[2:24:49] powerful weapon ever placed in the hand
[2:24:51] of man is prayer prayer changes thing it
[2:24:54] even changes the mind of God lord I
[2:24:56] can't fully qualify that statement and
[2:24:58] understand it but it's true it changes
[2:25:03] things then he come and told us the most
[2:25:05] powerful weapon that he knows of his
[2:25:08] love so God may we take these two powers
[2:25:12] and merge them together that we can have
[2:25:15] faith and love and prayer to be a
[2:25:19] dynamic power powerful force that you've
[2:25:21] put in our hands and put in our mouth
[2:25:24] and may we use it for your glory may we
[2:25:26] use it for the benefit of those around
[2:25:28] us God help us to stay desperate by
[2:25:32] having genuine love and Lord help us to
[2:25:35] stay confident because of your placing
[2:25:39] May that confidence Lord be in what you
[2:25:41] have done and what you have said not any
[2:25:44] Earthly fleshly thing that we have but
[2:25:46] just the position youve put us in may we
[2:25:48] be confident that we're your children
[2:25:50] confident we're your bride and confident
[2:25:52] you placed Us in this Earth at such a
[2:25:54] time as this to be agents and bassadors
[2:25:58] for you and God May that confidence
[2:26:01] build faith that when we request when we
[2:26:03] see when we hear when we request that
[2:26:06] you'll move for faith is what moves the
[2:26:10] mountains God we're trusting in you and
[2:26:12] asking God that you would just help us
[2:26:15] to stay out of the way our own flesh our
[2:26:18] own carnality
[2:26:20] God we get
[2:26:21] tired we suffer rejection we get
[2:26:25] heartbroken God we want to run away
[2:26:28] sometimes sometimes we want to break
[2:26:30] sometimes we want to serve
[2:26:33] ourselves but God help us to
[2:26:35] recognize that you're a
[2:26:37] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[2:26:40] you that our rewards will come later
[2:26:44] Lord may we stay engaged keep us
[2:26:48] forgiving surrendered
[2:26:52] sacrificing the same way you lived on
[2:26:54] this Earth may we live on this
[2:26:57] Earth God I pray that you would help us
[2:27:01] to be your
[2:27:02] ambassadors help us to be better

[2:27:12] authority and the power you've placed in
[2:27:13] our hands help us to exercise it more
[2:27:15] than we have in the past and help us to
[2:27:17] do so with faith knowing god God that
