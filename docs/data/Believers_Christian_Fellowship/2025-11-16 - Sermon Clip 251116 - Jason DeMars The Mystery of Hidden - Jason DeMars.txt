TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So there had to be a perfect lamb. There had to be a sinless sacrifice. Couldn't have any stain. You and I could not be in a redeemer on that level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We couldn't redeem the human race. It couldn't just be anyone. It had to be a specially &gt;&gt; designed man. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Fully man. Totally man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living and dwelling amongst men. But he had to be without fa fault, without spot. He couldn't be tainted by the original sin. Couldn't be tainted by even Mary, Mary's blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people will say, "But what about what about wasn't he fed by Mary?" And then they come up with fantastic explanations to say, "No, he wasn't fed. It was just supernatural." No. Study it a little bit and you'll understand none of the blood of the mother passes through the placenta into the baby. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Never does. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; None of it. just the nutrients and the blood comes out of the baby and is filtered &gt;&gt; through the placenta and through the mother's liver. &gt;&gt; So none of the blood of Mary, she w she was his incubator. &gt;&gt; She was &gt;&gt; she was the woman that didn't fall that said yes to God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so she brought forth the redeemer, but it wasn't her blood because if her blood were there, well, number one, it would kill him. If if a mother's blood gets to the baby's blood, it it would kill him because they don't have this. Sometimes they don't have the same blood type. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the blood, Brother Brandham says the blood comes from the father. &gt;&gt; And so it's he's not tainted by that blood. He's not tainted by the human race. And yet he is coming perfectly through the human race. Only God could put this together. Even I believe that even when he designed the woman at the beginning, he had in mind this is how my son is going to come and he cannot be tainted by the blood. So I'm going to make a placenta exactly like this and I'm going to make it to deal with the blood and the nutrients and everything because &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; My son will later be born and he can't have Mary's blood. &gt;&gt; Right? There had to be a a redeemer because there had to be someone that came and took the book in his hand again. There had to be a second Adam. &gt;&gt; There had to be a new federal head of the human race &gt;&gt; that took control &gt;&gt; and said, "I I will take dominion. I will take authority. I will take the book. &gt;&gt; I will stand in your place. I will take &gt;&gt; the pain. I will take the suffering. I will take everything that you've done wrong, all the evil that you've done, &gt;&gt; all the wickedness, all the stain, all the blame. I will take it myself and I will bear it for you. And God will pour his wrath out on me. &gt;&gt; That the wrath that he the anger that he has towards you because of your sin, instead of pouring it out on you, he poured it out on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he took that for you. Why? Because he was going to redeem you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he didn't redeem you &gt;&gt; at Calvary. He paid the price &gt;&gt; to redeem you at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came in 1963 &gt;&gt; to take the book &gt;&gt; to redeem you. Amen.
