[4:52] to minister it was a good place for me
[4:55] amen i was so blessed when we got there
[4:57] and saw the church and
[4:58] the church was in order and when i was
[5:01] preaching it was just like being here it
[5:02] was
[5:03] freedom and the spirit to preach and
[5:05] while i was preaching there was such a
[5:06] pull and such freedom
[5:08] as that these people are being taught
[5:09] the word amen and it was a good feeling
[5:12] and it was a good homey feeling a good
[5:13] place to be
[5:14] and so it's it's a pleasure to have
[5:16] brother yatzik here and

[6:43] going to get something wonderful
[6:45] from the hand of my savior tonight and

[6:49] the same mind we're going to have a
[6:51] wonderful service
[6:52] amen it was a pleasure to be in brother
[6:54] yahtzek's church and
[6:56] i felt like as i began to minister and
[6:57] the people there began to pull that i
[6:59] could just set my wings and fly
[7:01] and it was a pleasure to preach and i'd
[7:04] like you to help me to return the favor
[7:07] let's make it a pleasure for our brother
[7:09] to preach just that he could
[7:10] just slip into that channel where he's

[10:26] greet you in the precious and lord jesus
[10:27] christ
[10:28] for the privilege and joy for us to be
[10:31] here in the middle of the week
[10:33] and gathering in his name i believe that
[10:36] uh you are under expectation and you
[10:38] pray for me
[10:40] truly in my heart i'm just expecting
[10:42] something
[10:43] from his side because uh you know we are
[10:46] coming
[10:47] here in his name and uh you know under
[10:50] expectation and we
[10:51] we should we should be focused on him
[10:54] and
[10:54] it's indeed the truth that's when but
[10:56] the chat and
[10:58] uh benjamin was in our place last year
[11:01] was
[11:01] really a blessing i'm just looking
[11:03] around to see by the benjamin i don't
[11:05] know if he's in the meeting or not
[11:06] he didn't wave me yet but he's somewhere
[11:09] not here okay anyways you know
[11:13] god bless you brother and uh but chat he
[11:15] was preaching for us it was a really
[11:17] really uh wonderful time we didn't know
[11:20] each other before
[11:21] it was the brothers from serbia that uh
[11:24] kind of orchestrated this
[11:25] meeting you know and called me up with a
[11:28] desire to
[11:29] meet together last year and
[11:32] they proposed by the chat his ministry
[11:35] because they said
[11:36] they are going to be there with brother
[11:38] benjamin so i said well
[11:40] just we don't know each other we never
[11:42] met each other
[11:44] but i listened one sermon some years ago
[11:47] he preached on the cloud
[11:49] you know and the importance of the you
[11:51] know who came down really in that age
[11:54] and i really appreciate it when he
[11:57] took a stand and he just uh protect you
[11:59] know something that is so precious for
[12:01] us for the bride of christ
[12:03] and i said just you was such a
[12:04] tremendous wonderful meeting
[12:06] and in fact it was the only one i heard
[12:09] but it was such a good
[12:10] one so i said just come come
[12:13] come all of you and we had a wonderful
[12:15] wonderful time of fellowship and
[12:17] that's probably how i'm here first time
[12:19] in ohio
[12:20] and i appreciate real song of the nathan
[12:23] maybe
[12:24] 20 minutes ago i just asked him uh you
[12:26] know
[12:27] are you going to sing something maybe on
[12:29] the way to the church he said yes
[12:31] but maybe 20 minutes ago i asked him uh
[12:33] uh
[12:34] what's what's your song and he said
[12:37] the the line of the type of judah
[12:39] prevailed
[12:40] i said i didn't say anything but this is
[12:42] my scripture for
[12:44] for tonight maybe a little few verses
[12:47] forward but from revelation 5 and
[12:51] i really like to see the little things
[12:53] how they are dovetailing because it
[12:55] gives you
[12:55] encourage uh you know that the lord is
[12:58] with us and he's working through the
[12:59] body
[13:00] so may the lord bless you you have to
[13:03] understand in my english i never
[13:05] learned english in any school and so my
[13:07] english is
[13:08] kind of maybe kentucky english or
[13:10] whatever it's from the tapes
[13:13] i really many many years ago almost 30
[13:15] years ago i
[13:16] i i start to learn and i promise to the
[13:19] lord that
[13:20] if he will bless me with understanding
[13:21] that language
[13:23] and i will use it for his glory i wanted
[13:26] to understand and also speak
[13:28] and he gave me grace of both maybe i'm
[13:31] not a professional but still i can
[13:33] communicate
[13:34] and preach the word of god and i believe
[13:37] that it will help me will be a blessing
[13:39] for all of us
[13:40] because we are not here to preach
[13:42] ourselves to be
[13:44] focused on us on the human side
[13:47] humanistic realm but we are here to hear
[13:49] from him
[13:50] and so may the lord bless you i will not
[13:53] just keep you
[13:54] too long i will try to do that uh
[13:57] the brothers by the chat he gave me a
[13:59] really liberty
[14:00] but i said no no no i will not preach so
[14:02] long as you offer me even
[14:05] i i want to really go to the point and
[14:07] just uh but
[14:08] also i want to just give him a liberty
[14:11] of the holy spirit
[14:12] to move the way he wants uh you know
[14:15] because we are the
[14:16] um creatures of eternity we are not just
[14:20] we are really a time timely bound but we
[14:23] know those things on a daily basis but
[14:25] we are more than these
[14:27] we are more than these elements that
[14:29] bound us and put to the pest house
[14:32] we are the we came from above we are
[14:34] coming back
[14:35] uh to our position like jesus when he
[14:37] came down he said i'm coming for the
[14:39] father i'm coming back
[14:41] to the father we know we've been part of
[14:43] him from the beginning
[14:45] in him he was our voice in those days we
[14:47] are his voice today
[14:49] so we know we are coming back and we are
[14:52] the creatures of
[14:53] uh eternity so god bless you i ask you
[14:56] to stand up we read first from the
[14:59] song of solomon song of solomon chapter
[15:03] 2
[15:05] the second chapter of song of solomon
[15:08] from the verse 10 up to 15
[15:13] and greetings from our assembly from the
[15:15] south of poland
[15:16] poland as some of you may be know this
[15:19] is really a catholic country
[15:21] 97 97 percent of population of
[15:24] our country is the catholics but anyways
[15:27] you know god
[15:28] placed us there to represent him and it
[15:31] doesn't matter because uh
[15:33] even he said some good things about the
[15:35] catholics
[15:36] how the catholics coming to the prayer
[15:38] line they've got tremendous faith
[15:40] because they were taught for years that
[15:42] god is using a
[15:43] human body to communicate to unveil
[15:46] himself you know and
[15:48] we know that finally in our age we know
[15:51] it is working like that
[15:52] so even the protestants they've got a
[15:54] problem today they were very very close
[15:56] to god but they
[15:58] they are depending on the experiences
[16:00] different things
[16:01] so much and they didn't recognize that
[16:04] god promised
[16:05] in the last age he will send us a
[16:08] human being someone in the spirit of
[16:11] elijah
[16:12] with a ministry to turn our hearts back
[16:14] to the
[16:15] hearts of our fathers and you know he
[16:18] used a man
[16:19] he always used a man and many times
[16:22] the people they've got a great faith
[16:23] until they will see god is using a man
[16:26] they are very uh offended because they
[16:29] they would prefer the angel but god
[16:32] doesn't use the
[16:33] angels this way to preach the gospel he
[16:35] is using
[16:36] human beings so we are very very
[16:39] privileged
[16:39] very happy in those days to to have an
[16:42] open ear
[16:43] and living heart to trying to absorb the
[16:47] things the lord
[16:48] stored for us in that age amen so the
[16:51] song of solomon second chapter from the
[16:54] verse 10
[16:56] my beloved spake and said unto me
[17:00] rise up my love my fair one
[17:03] and come away for law the winter is past
[17:07] the rain is over and gone certain season
[17:11] is passed the winter is past you've got
[17:14] a similar winter like in poland it's
[17:16] really
[17:16] really freezing you know it's it's cold
[17:18] you know but when this uh
[17:20] that season is past the new season is
[17:23] open
[17:24] and we i believe that we understand the
[17:26] bible in the in the way we shoot
[17:28] you know the old testament was written
[17:30] in the symbols
[17:31] it was it was a shadow of the new things
[17:34] that came in the new testament
[17:36] especially in
[17:36] our time we understand you know the
[17:38] value of the bible
[17:40] because the bible became a new book for
[17:41] us god took away the condemnation that
[17:44] always we we look uh from the uh
[17:48] perspective of the condemned person to
[17:50] the bible
[17:51] we're trying to understand it but uh you
[17:54] know the shadow that was hanging over us
[17:56] was not allowing us really to to catch
[17:58] the real meaning what was in the world
[18:00] but we are living in the the golden age
[18:03] the
[18:04] the the best time we could live so we
[18:06] can see
[18:07] uh we understand these symbols it's not
[18:09] the symbols anymore it's a revelation
[18:11] for us
[18:12] so the winter is past the rain is over
[18:16] and gone
[18:17] the flowers appear on the earth amen the
[18:20] manifestation of the seed
[18:22] is not the seed anymore but the flowers
[18:24] appeared
[18:26] and the time of the singing of birds is
[18:28] come
[18:30] praise god the voice of the turtle is
[18:32] heard in our land
[18:34] the fig tree put it forth her green fix
[18:38] and the wine with the tender grape give
[18:41] a good smell arise my love
[18:44] my fair one and come away all my doves
[18:48] that aren't in the clefts of the rock
[18:52] in the secret places of the stars let me
[18:56] see thy countenance let my hear thy
[18:59] voice
[19:01] for sweet is thy voice and thy
[19:03] countenance is calmly
[19:05] this is really a book about a
[19:07] relationship
[19:09] about the uh really
[19:12] very close contact of the bride and the
[19:14] bride room how the man
[19:16] and the woman are coming together and
[19:18] they are praising each other
[19:20] and this is really on the level that we
[19:21] cannot understand unless we are in the
[19:23] same relationship
[19:25] so we know the bible is uh is a book of
[19:27] mystery
[19:28] for many people but it's the mystery is
[19:31] broken
[19:32] when the relationship is coming together
[19:35] of these two
[19:36] take us the foxes the little foxes
[19:40] that spoil the vines for our vine
[19:43] vines have tender grapes my beloved is
[19:47] mine
[19:48] and i'm his he fitted among
[19:51] the lilies and he's speaking about the
[19:55] union of the
[19:56] christ and the bride the mystery of god
[19:58] that was hidden in the bible
[20:00] in every chapter every verse but now the
[20:02] mystery is open
[20:04] because the mystery of the marriage the
[20:05] union god and the man again
[20:09] and now let's open revelation 5.
[20:12] revelation 5 but then nathan he
[20:16] sunk revelation 5 1 up to five
[20:19] i will just read from the sixth verse
[20:23] up to ten revelation five
[20:26] six up to ten
[20:33] and i beheld and law in the midst of the
[20:36] throne
[20:37] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[20:40] of the elders
[20:41] stood the lamb as it had been slain
[20:44] having seven horns and seven eyes
[20:47] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[20:50] forth
[20:51] into all the earth and he came and took
[20:55] the book
[20:56] out of the right hand of him that sat
[20:58] upon the throne
[21:00] and when he had taken the book the four
[21:03] beasts
[21:03] and four and twenty elders fell down
[21:06] before the lamb
[21:08] having every one of them harps and
[21:10] golden
[21:11] vials full of odors which are the
[21:13] prayers
[21:14] of saints and they sung a new song
[21:18] saying thou are worthy to take the book
[21:21] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[21:24] has
[21:25] slain and has redeemed us to god by the
[21:28] blood
[21:28] out of every kindred and tongue
[21:32] and people and nation and has made us
[21:35] unto our god kings and priests and we
[21:38] have
[21:39] we shall reign on the earth
[21:42] amen let's bow our heads the word of
[21:44] prayer
[21:46] our precious heavenly father we deem
[21:49] this as a great privilege tonight
[21:51] to be gathered together in thy name lord
[21:54] jesus
[21:55] let us go into the spirit of composer
[21:58] of this great heavenly music that was
[22:02] written
[22:02] on the pages of the bible father let us
[22:05] go into the harmony
[22:07] of your spirit and understand the things
[22:09] that you
[22:10] want to express and manifest among us
[22:13] tonight

[22:16] on the history

[23:02] that you have chosen us before the
[23:04] foundation of the world

[23:24] so let us go in the spirit and just
[23:26] understand and just
[23:27] leave this building tonight as a change
[23:30] people lord
[23:31] with a closer walk with a closer
[23:33] understanding
[23:34] with a deeper more profound insight
[23:38] to the mystery of god bless the people
[23:41] here tonight and just
[23:42] help me to express your purpose for
[23:44] tonight
[23:45] and just bless the scripture we read we
[23:47] appreciate so much
[23:48] the bible and the open book the living
[23:51] bible in those days
[23:52] just we give you praise and honor for
[23:54] everything you have done already
[23:56] and you are going to do for thy glory in
[23:58] the precious name of lord jesus christ
[24:00] amen so god bless you take your seats
[24:04] amen amen
[24:09] so my subject my little subject is the
[24:12] unwritten
[24:13] song of solomon unwritten
[24:16] song of solomon and we know that uh the
[24:19] bible is written in a very special way
[24:22] this is a bible bible as a book that uh
[24:25] there's no book in this world that we
[24:27] can compare with the bible because the
[24:29] bible is
[24:30] written in such a harmony we know that
[24:32] god used so many
[24:34] people in the space of so many years you
[24:36] know and
[24:38] all these chapters all these uh books of
[24:41] the bible they are written in such a
[24:42] harmony
[24:43] that no prophet no apostle never rise up
[24:47] uh contradicting by writing the his book
[24:50] you know contradicting the
[24:51] another part of the bible that was
[24:52] written before so
[24:54] that's the reason we're supposed to
[24:55] appreciate you know that the bible as
[24:57] the
[24:58] the holy book god in the printed form
[25:00] and
[25:01] because god is able and he's willing
[25:04] always to speak to us
[25:05] by these verses but you know that uh
[25:08] the biggest challenge is to go into the
[25:10] spirit of the bible
[25:12] to go into the spirit of uh uh you know
[25:15] author of the bible which is a god
[25:17] himself the problem of the so many
[25:19] denominations and contradictions between
[25:22] the one and another
[25:23] is that the people they are trying to
[25:25] understand in their own carnal way
[25:28] reading the bible that we read but they
[25:29] are not trying to go
[25:31] in the spirit of of uh outer of the
[25:34] bible
[25:34] and it causes a clash after clash after
[25:36] clash misunderstanding people they are
[25:39] just
[25:39] uh discouraged they don't understand
[25:41] they are living
[25:42] trying to join they're living you know
[25:45] but
[25:46] if we are able to go into the spirit
[25:49] of the outer of the bible which is that
[25:51] god himself
[25:52] he's the author of the of that book you
[25:55] know there is no contradiction
[25:57] there is no confusion it's always such a
[26:00] wonderful experience when god is open
[26:03] his own word for you
[26:04] and me in a personal way and this is my
[26:07] expectation for tonight
[26:09] i know that our time is limited but holy
[26:11] spirit is here
[26:12] and he's he was he's going to deal with
[26:15] your heart my heart
[26:16] in a personal way because you and and me
[26:19] before him
[26:20] he knows you by name he knows me by name
[26:23] and
[26:24] you know we are here as a group but he
[26:26] is going to deal with you in a personal
[26:27] way
[26:29] that's the way he is doing the job
[26:31] always
[26:32] and uh you know we supposed to go to the
[26:35] spirit of composer
[26:37] because the bible is written like a
[26:39] music in a certain harmony
[26:41] i don't mean uh you know modern music
[26:44] this is a chaos this is really something
[26:47] against
[26:48] the heartbeat something against you know
[26:49] that was for for uh
[26:51] ages centuries it was working like this
[26:54] even the
[26:55] secular music was still in a certain
[26:57] rhythm that was right
[26:59] but now in the last uh uh hundred years
[27:02] was a change of the
[27:03] the beat change of the music change of
[27:06] their rhythm
[27:06] you know and now even the uh so-called
[27:09] christian churches
[27:10] you know accepted you this modern way of
[27:14] expressing the music and it's absolutely
[27:16] wrong we know this is not right
[27:18] but the bible is written in the harmony
[27:22] no contradiction like in the right kind
[27:24] of music
[27:25] so that's the reason you know uh if we
[27:28] can
[27:29] go into the understanding of the deeper
[27:31] things we have to just be in the
[27:32] relationship with god
[27:34] and you know the when the salomon has
[27:37] written
[27:37] uh the the book this we call it a song
[27:41] of
[27:41] solomon which is like uh the the song
[27:45] about
[27:45] all songs you know uh he has
[27:48] written uh eight chapters and if you
[27:51] carefully study you know this book
[27:54] in these eight chapters you will find uh
[27:56] six songs
[27:58] there's a six songs included in eight
[28:00] chapters and we know that
[28:02] god runs with the numbers we we cannot
[28:04] go into that
[28:05] tonight it's not necessary you
[28:07] understand that it's you know
[28:09] bible is not written haphazardly this is
[28:12] really something lost
[28:13] uh is coming right from the mind of god
[28:15] it's perfect there is no fault in the
[28:17] bible
[28:18] and you know if the solomon we know that
[28:20] he was living in the golden age
[28:23] we know there is there was no age like
[28:25] this in the old testament
[28:27] when god was identified so much with the
[28:30] human flesh like a solomon
[28:32] and the people around him around the
[28:34] gift that was given to solomon
[28:37] we know that it was uh called even the
[28:39] golden age in the
[28:41] old testament it was a prototype of the
[28:45] millennial reign for thousand years in
[28:48] in future
[28:49] it was such a great moment such a great
[28:51] time but
[28:52] we know it was a beginning it was a
[28:54] final end
[28:55] of the reign of solomon because a
[28:57] solomon he was such a great man
[28:59] he got the gift of wisdom he got the
[29:03] gift of discernment
[29:04] but we know still as much his position
[29:07] was
[29:08] he received just a gift and a gift was
[29:11] given by
[29:12] god to him and we know the gifts uh
[29:15] are all right as on as long as they are
[29:17] connected with the out of the gifts
[29:20] and we know as long as the uh solomon
[29:23] was enough humble to listen the advices
[29:26] of god and he was staying in the
[29:28] relationship with god himself
[29:30] you know his kingdom was unshakable
[29:34] no one was able to defeat the kingdom
[29:36] and we know never no one defeated
[29:39] the kingdom from outside as long as
[29:41] salomon was
[29:42] was a king but we know there was a final
[29:45] time
[29:45] when he lost his position and his
[29:48] connection with god was not as
[29:49] he was at the beginning he was losing
[29:51] his authority
[29:52] he was losing his position and his
[29:55] kingdom uh was fall to pieces from
[29:58] inside
[30:00] that's mostly how the people they don't
[30:02] expect the enemy
[30:03] they think the enemy is always coming
[30:05] from outside
[30:06] but you know the reason why the kingdom
[30:09] of solomon
[30:10] with the golden age with such a
[30:13] authority he had that all the
[30:15] other nations around have to respect
[30:17] salomon
[30:18] and pay uh you know offerings different
[30:20] things you know
[30:22] expressing the you know that they they
[30:24] are in agreement you know about his
[30:26] position
[30:27] why it was changed because uh salomon
[30:31] was equipped with a gift you know and
[30:36] we have to compare it quickly with the
[30:37] new testament with our time
[30:40] why god promise that will rise up the
[30:43] group of people in the last days
[30:45] that won't be shaken won't be deceived
[30:49] cannot be defeated was there was a
[30:51] difference we know that paul
[30:53] apostle paul in the book of ephesians he
[30:55] was praying for ephesians
[30:58] which was the most spiritual church that
[31:00] was
[31:01] given grace to him to speak to to them
[31:04] we know he said i pray
[31:08] to the father that the god will give you
[31:10] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[31:13] there is a difference between the gift
[31:15] of wisdom
[31:16] and the spirit of wisdom there is a
[31:19] difference between the
[31:21] discernment and the spirit of
[31:23] discernment because the gift of
[31:25] discernment a gift of wisdom
[31:27] can fail it will just disconnect the
[31:30] god himself with the gift that he gave
[31:33] to you
[31:34] and you will depend on the gift doesn't
[31:36] matter what kind of gift it is
[31:38] you will disconnect yourself by this
[31:40] connected relationship with the god
[31:42] himself
[31:43] he's the author or every good gift
[31:46] and that's what solomon did finally he
[31:49] trusted
[31:49] you know the women let's say churches
[31:52] he trusted you know he was dependent on
[31:54] himself on the gift he had
[31:56] he never lost the gift but he lost
[31:59] relationship
[32:01] am i right so you know his gift
[32:04] failed but you know when jesus cried
[32:08] jesus christ has come he said the
[32:10] greater the solomon is here right now
[32:12] and we are living in the same age we are
[32:15] living a golden age
[32:16] like a solomon was living in a golden
[32:18] age of the old testament
[32:20] when jesus christ has come first time it
[32:22] was a golden age
[32:24] it was a crowning of the old testament
[32:27] the all the prophets you know the
[32:29] the wise men they were just writing
[32:32] predicting
[32:32] pointing of the moment when jesus christ
[32:35] has come
[32:36] and he said he himself he said greater
[32:39] than solomon is here
[32:40] right now and we know there was a alpha
[32:43] time
[32:44] and god predicted the omega time will be
[32:46] a group of people in the last days
[32:48] or so with the golden age we are living
[32:52] in a golden age
[32:53] which is the harvest time reproduction
[32:55] of the same seed that was planted
[32:57] 2 000 years ago is reproductive today
[33:00] again
[33:02] so we can see that we can compare the
[33:04] days of solomon
[33:05] with the days of the first coming of the
[33:07] lord and the days of the second coming
[33:09] of the lord
[33:10] you can see you know how it's related to
[33:13] each other
[33:15] the reason why the bride of christ
[33:18] cannot fail
[33:19] we are not depending on the gifts
[33:21] [Music]
[33:22] we are not depending even of the gift of
[33:24] wisdom
[33:26] discernment different gifts around us
[33:29] god gave it to the church many years ago
[33:32] even when the pentecostals rise up
[33:34] that god poured out his spirit upon the
[33:37] people
[33:38] more than thousands more more than 100
[33:40] years ago it was a restoration of the
[33:42] gifts
[33:43] but with the gifts people will fail he
[33:46] will not just continue to walk in the
[33:48] light
[33:49] of the revelation of his word
[33:52] there is something more than the gift of
[33:54] wisdom there is a spirit of wisdom
[33:57] and spirit of wisdom is god himself
[34:01] and the paul he was praying for the
[34:03] ephesians
[34:04] they will receive the spirit of wisdom
[34:06] and revelation
[34:07] which is a holy spirit god himself
[34:10] living in us
[34:11] amen he will stay in the spirit of
[34:14] revelation
[34:15] spread our wisdom we cannot fail amen
[34:19] because the word of god cannot fail this
[34:22] is the reason why
[34:23] solomon failed but you know
[34:26] before he failed he has written
[34:30] something three books we know that that
[34:33] are part of the bible
[34:34] and they are absolutely inspired
[34:37] absolutely real
[34:39] you know and the book of solomon the
[34:42] song of solomon
[34:44] contains a six songs and we know the six
[34:48] is a good number but this is not the the
[34:51] best number
[34:52] because number seven
[34:55] is a number that represents completion
[34:58] perfection
[34:59] and the salomon even when he was
[35:01] inspired he was writing
[35:04] 1005 songs and three thousand proverbs
[35:09] when he was writing a song of solomon
[35:12] it was a special song special book
[35:16] contains six songs but he was not able
[35:20] to come to the seventh one because god
[35:23] was
[35:23] hiding certain mystery in the old
[35:25] testament
[35:26] for the people of the new testament it
[35:29] was the mystery of the union
[35:31] perfect union between the man and god
[35:34] you know so that we want to just look on
[35:36] the solomon and
[35:38] this book the the song of solomon
[35:41] because
[35:42] this describes relationship in the
[35:44] prophetic form
[35:46] many things that the solomon has written
[35:49] is a prophecy
[35:50] prophecy for the end time prophecy that
[35:53] describes a union
[35:55] that is going to be restored in the last
[35:57] days between the man
[35:58] and god again union that existed first
[36:02] time
[36:02] in the garden of eden when god and the
[36:05] man
[36:06] adam on the earth they're a perfect way
[36:09] of communication
[36:10] the channel of communication was so pure
[36:13] that god could communicate with adam
[36:15] perfectly because adam was on the level
[36:19] of god
[36:21] he was on the level god was speaking
[36:23] even
[36:24] thinking and ana was able to just catch
[36:27] it
[36:28] and speak it out what god thought
[36:31] you know in heaven adam was able to
[36:33] speak it out on the earth
[36:35] it was a perfect way of communication
[36:38] but it was lost but god promised i'm
[36:41] going to restore it
[36:43] i'm going to restore it back so we have
[36:46] to
[36:47] look on the bible watch it carefully
[36:49] because god gave
[36:51] in the old testament certain signs
[36:54] signs and points you know that he will
[36:56] just trace it
[36:58] we can see how this great story of
[37:00] restoration
[37:02] can unveil before our eyes
[37:05] you know so first of all the song of
[37:08] solomon
[37:09] is a dialogue it's a description of the
[37:11] dialogue between the bride and the bride
[37:13] room
[37:14] and it's such a great thing that uh many
[37:17] people
[37:18] even the theologians you know that
[37:20] probably theologians they were against
[37:23] that book to put it as a part of the
[37:25] bible
[37:26] because they said it's so small almost
[37:29] nothing about god
[37:30] mentioned in that book and they say how
[37:33] it's such a book that you can
[37:35] you can read it and sometimes you think
[37:37] you you can draw conclusions
[37:39] that you you think my goodness this is
[37:41] part of the bible
[37:43] yes whole scripture whole bible
[37:46] is inspired every verse every scripture
[37:48] is inspired
[37:50] and god just took decision to put these
[37:53] books in the bible that he put put in
[37:56] for us
[37:57] for our edification correction
[38:00] encouragement that's the reason it's
[38:03] such a supernatural
[38:04] book and only way how we can understand
[38:06] this book
[38:07] we have to come to the relationship with
[38:09] the author of that book
[38:11] that's the reason if someone is not born
[38:13] again
[38:15] cannot understand this book
[38:18] many people are trying to explain
[38:20] understand
[38:21] explain even their fasting about this
[38:24] book the meaning of the verses
[38:26] different things but we can understand
[38:28] that book on the one base
[38:30] it must be a personal revelation of
[38:33] jesus christ for you
[38:35] this is a new birth when we are coming
[38:37] to a new birth experience
[38:38] we are coming right to his kingdom then
[38:41] the things
[38:42] that we couldn't see before we can see
[38:44] clearly
[38:46] you are receiving a new sight new sense
[38:49] of hearing
[38:50] clear-cut hearing clear-cut scene
[38:53] you are getting a new sense of
[38:55] understanding of the things
[38:57] that before you are just only presuming
[39:00] that's the reason a new birth is so
[39:02] important
[39:03] in every church even today people they
[39:06] they think they are born again
[39:08] born again but they are not fruits of
[39:10] the being born again
[39:11] no understanding law no revelation no
[39:14] power to overcome
[39:16] but those things are coming by the new
[39:18] birth experience
[39:20] by the new birth experience you are
[39:22] coming to the the most
[39:24] close relationship with god that you can
[39:27] imagine
[39:29] amen so when he wrote
[39:32] you know the six songs in the eight
[39:35] chapters
[39:37] there was a certain mystery that was
[39:40] hidden even before solomon salomon was a
[39:43] great man he was a very wise man but he
[39:46] let's say he didn't understand what is
[39:48] uh what is coming
[39:50] after a person passes away
[39:53] when the person is is dead what the next
[39:56] he said
[39:57] he said the life doesn't make really a
[39:59] meaning and
[40:00] you know you can you can you can just
[40:02] collect the things you know you can
[40:04] you can be a good you can you can work
[40:06] properly you get a house property
[40:09] different things he said but what about
[40:12] you
[40:12] who will just take it after you so he
[40:14] didn't understand you know
[40:16] what he said he gave a question what is
[40:18] about the human being
[40:19] after he passed away he didn't know he
[40:22] didn't know the mystery of the
[40:23] resurrection
[40:24] he didn't know the the life after death
[40:27] he didn't know those things because
[40:28] it was filled up before him but god
[40:32] you know like for the most of the
[40:33] prophets of the old testament
[40:35] he was giving them a certain glimpse
[40:38] of the mystery for each and every one of
[40:41] the prophet he gave a certain glimpse
[40:43] like for jeremiah isaiah solomon david
[40:46] moses
[40:47] all of them they describe one mystery
[40:50] one mystery in the bible
[40:51] from their perspective okay but you know
[40:54] god
[40:56] allows us the people of the new
[40:58] testament the people of the
[41:00] open book he allows us to see
[41:03] the things in a real way not from the
[41:06] certain perspective
[41:07] but from the real perspective you we can
[41:10] see
[41:11] the things not there partitionally but
[41:13] in a real way
[41:15] and it's possible only by the holy ghost
[41:18] only by the holy ghost that's the reason
[41:20] you need to have a holy ghost
[41:22] as a person amen then you are coming to
[41:25] the relationship
[41:26] that adam lost he couldn't communicate
[41:29] anymore because he just dropped down
[41:31] from the higher dimension
[41:33] the lower dimension you know he
[41:35] struggled he was
[41:36] he was more focused how to survive there
[41:39] was no peace like before there was no
[41:41] joy like before
[41:43] there was no connection with god like
[41:45] before
[41:46] understanding was known like that he
[41:48] lost even the
[41:49] vocabulary that he had excess before
[41:53] all those things happened before he lost
[41:55] the relationship
[41:57] but god promised i'm going to restore it
[42:00] i'm going to restore it
[42:02] praise god so the the song of
[42:05] solomon is the description how this uh
[42:09] two people are thinking about each other
[42:11] in
[42:12] such a wonderful way as we said the
[42:15] people they think this book is
[42:17] uh they've got a different thoughts i
[42:20] don't know about you
[42:22] but you can have a different thought
[42:23] thoughts about this book
[42:25] but if you are coming to understanding
[42:28] that the bible is a supernatural
[42:30] book and you cannot understand that book
[42:33] from your level
[42:35] you have to just come up higher you have
[42:37] to come to the dimension
[42:39] where god exists you have to come to the
[42:42] spirit of the outer of that
[42:44] book then the things that you before
[42:46] understood in carnal way
[42:48] you finally understand in a real way
[42:52] that's what we need as a christian amen
[42:56] so there was a dialogue of the two
[42:57] lovers
[42:59] and they were praising each other you
[43:02] know
[43:02] uh in such a way there was so much in
[43:05] love
[43:07] you know that the mystery of the union
[43:09] between the man and god
[43:11] is included there how christ that before
[43:15] we we thought how who is
[43:19] you know every denomination describes
[43:20] christ and they say we've got the
[43:23] uh our our denomination is absolute
[43:27] our understanding is is right you are
[43:29] wrong you know but
[43:30] we we can see it cannot be this way
[43:34] must be one channel amen one place
[43:36] chosen by god
[43:38] place of the meeting and the union and
[43:41] understanding
[43:44] only one place and this place is in
[43:46] christ
[43:48] and christ is the mystery of god
[43:50] revealed
[43:51] and when we are coming into christ by
[43:53] the baptist of the holy spirit
[43:55] we've got access to his being then he is
[43:58] in you
[43:59] you are in him then these two they are
[44:01] one
[44:03] then he will praise you for your
[44:05] decision
[44:06] because he cannot praise no one else
[44:08] only himself
[44:10] because he is the world he cannot praise
[44:13] pentecostals because if god will praise
[44:16] pentecostals then it means he rejected
[44:19] methodists
[44:20] if you just uh chosen baptist or
[44:23] seven adventists you know he would have
[44:25] to reject the other denomination
[44:27] but he doesn't deal with denomination
[44:30] even your denomination my denomination
[44:33] if you have i i have one just sometimes
[44:36] the people can be domination
[44:38] but god doesn't care about your
[44:40] denomination
[44:43] he doesn't pay attention to our
[44:44] denomination
[44:46] he says come out come out of her
[44:49] come out of your understanding come out
[44:51] of your of your
[44:52] tradition denomination whatever stops
[44:55] you
[44:57] you have to come to the relationship you
[44:59] have to come to the union
[45:01] amen and we can see that
[45:04] uh you know if this book was written in
[45:07] the golden age
[45:09] in order to understand that book and the
[45:12] things that the solomon
[45:13] has written in his six songs you have to
[45:16] go
[45:16] to the golden age because you cannot
[45:19] understand a man
[45:21] and he's talking about something if you
[45:23] don't go in his shoes
[45:25] you have to understand his language you
[45:27] have to understand the experience
[45:30] what he experienced his life why he's
[45:32] writing this why he's talking like that
[45:34] why why
[45:35] what happened in his life then you can
[45:37] come to understanding
[45:39] and you know the song of solomon chapter
[45:41] 5
[45:43] from the verse 10 chapter 5
[45:46] verse 10 the bible says this is a bride
[45:50] praises her beloved one my beloved
[45:54] is white and rudy and
[45:58] jeffers among the thousands so
[46:02] she praises him amen
[46:05] the bride praises the bride room and
[46:07] she's
[46:08] sure that there's no one like he
[46:12] that's what you have to do in your life
[46:14] to be sure
[46:15] if there is anything better follow it
[46:19] but there is nothing better than christ
[46:22] follow him and only him
[46:24] be sure there is no one like him jesus
[46:27] christ
[46:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[46:31] there's no one like him today
[46:35] so she praises him because she's sure
[46:39] she praises him because she fall in love
[46:42] in him
[46:43] his head is as the most fine gold
[46:48] his head is my headship
[46:52] his head is like the most fine gold
[46:55] his logs are bushy and black as raven
[46:59] his eyes are as the eyes of doves
[47:03] by the rivers of waters wars with milk
[47:06] and fitly said so she is absolutely
[47:10] fall in love in him she praises him
[47:14] you know how you can understand someone
[47:18] that will praise someone like a woman
[47:21] praises
[47:22] a man or man praises the woman if you
[47:25] are not in the same relationship
[47:27] you can understand it that's the reason
[47:29] this book is
[47:30] misunderstood that's the reason even
[47:33] christians are misunderstood
[47:34] because when you are falling in love in
[47:36] christ you will do the things that
[47:38] usually people around you they will not
[47:40] do
[47:41] and you cannot even explain it how
[47:44] someone
[47:44] is in love with someone can explain his
[47:47] action
[47:48] if the love is supernatural you cannot
[47:51] miss your love
[47:53] you cannot wait laugh because it's
[47:56] supernatural
[47:57] you cannot even measure peace and joy
[48:00] because all those elements are
[48:02] supernatural
[48:03] and and this book describes those things
[48:06] this is a different language
[48:07] this is language that you can understand
[48:10] only if you are falling in love
[48:14] so his head is as the most fine gold
[48:19] and his eyes are as the eyes of doves
[48:23] so he's using the symbols and he says
[48:26] the bride
[48:27] is glad of his head
[48:30] which is intelligence that's how the
[48:32] solomon described it
[48:34] he said he his his head
[48:38] is so is such a authority
[48:41] for her she's fall in love in him
[48:45] and she praises his head and he compares
[48:48] his hair to the god
[48:51] the pure is god amen she compares
[48:55] his eyes to deaths amen
[48:58] so he she says other words his
[49:01] intelligence
[49:02] i accept it i rest in his intelligence
[49:05] in his head i rest in his
[49:09] type of vision whatever he can see the
[49:12] dove is the type of the holy ghost
[49:14] innocent innocent perfect
[49:18] i'm resting in his vision i'm resting in
[49:20] his intelligence
[49:22] i'm just i i love him i praise him
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] you know that uh
[49:32] the bible describes the most precious
[49:35] gold
[49:36] in the old testament let's open book of
[49:39] isaiah book of isaiah chapter 13.
[49:44] from the verse 9
[49:50] so she can see his head as the most
[49:54] fine god what's the meaning of the most
[49:59] fine god isaiah chapter 13
[50:03] from the verse 9 behold
[50:07] the day of the lord cometh cruel both
[50:11] with wrought and fierce
[50:14] anger to lay the land desolate
[50:19] and he shall destroy the sinners thereof
[50:21] out of it
[50:23] for the stars of heaven and their
[50:25] constellations thereof
[50:27] shall not give daylight
[50:30] the sun shall be darkened in his going
[50:33] forth
[50:34] and the moon shall not cause her light
[50:37] to shine
[50:38] isaiah can see the sixth seal
[50:41] he's describing a judgment
[50:45] we are facing the judgment what we can
[50:48] see around the world
[50:49] right now what's going on in every
[50:52] continent
[50:53] every nation more or less but this is
[50:56] judgment
[50:57] because the rejection of the world and
[51:00] isaiah can see the sixth
[51:02] seal that it developed to to really the
[51:05] horrible
[51:06] pictures things you know that
[51:09] we believe the bride won't be here
[51:13] but we know that many times the sixth
[51:15] seal and the seven syllables connected
[51:18] not only because they are so close to
[51:20] each other
[51:21] but we know that we've been redeemed
[51:22] under the sixth seal
[51:24] but our names was revealed in the
[51:26] seventh one
[51:28] because the sixth seal is a single
[51:30] judgment
[51:32] and god required judgment because all of
[51:35] us have been born
[51:36] in sin shame iniquity we came to this
[51:39] world to
[51:39] to say lie that's the reason god's
[51:42] requirement was a judgment
[51:44] because he cannot just say okay i don't
[51:46] see your sin
[51:48] he see he sees our sins he said where
[51:52] are we
[51:53] that's the reason he took our judgment
[51:55] upon himself
[51:57] two thousand years ago it was our sixth
[52:00] seal
[52:01] requirements of god was met we've been
[52:03] redeeming him
[52:05] when he said it's finished it was
[52:07] finished
[52:08] your sin was finished once forever
[52:11] it's done you are free but
[52:14] if someone will reject it or just not
[52:18] accepted in the way god requires
[52:21] you know there is no seven seal there is
[52:23] no perfection there is no rest
[52:25] there is no deliverance there is no
[52:27] revealing of your your name
[52:30] people they will stay in the sixth seal
[52:32] for purification
[52:35] but when isaiah describes
[52:39] sixth seal he's coming to something else
[52:42] and he said i will punish the world for
[52:45] their evil
[52:46] and their wicked for their iniquity and
[52:50] i will cause the
[52:51] urgency of the proud to cease and will
[52:55] lay low the hatchness
[52:58] of the terrible now the verse 12
[53:02] listen i will make a man more precious
[53:06] than a fine gold amen all of south in
[53:09] the midst of the sixth seal
[53:11] he is something about he's telling about
[53:14] a different group
[53:15] he says i will make a man more precious
[53:18] than i find gold
[53:19] to find gold the best gold i will make a
[53:23] man
[53:23] more value than the best gold you can
[53:25] find
[53:27] even a man than the gold
[53:30] wage of offir and we know that in the
[53:34] old testament the days of solomon it was
[53:36] the best
[53:38] gold available it was the gold from
[53:40] ophir
[53:42] they imported you know by ships this
[53:45] gold
[53:46] and that's the way how the temple of
[53:48] solomon was built up
[53:50] the resting place for great jehovah he
[53:52] came down in the cloud
[53:54] he was dwelling the place but it was
[53:56] built up
[53:57] in all these places by god
[54:00] and uh you know when this goal was found
[54:03] and imported it was the goal of offir
[54:07] and ofir was not in israel it was
[54:11] imported
[54:12] it was from the gentiles it was from the
[54:15] hidden country amen
[54:19] it was showing something that god will
[54:21] find a special
[54:23] type of material very plastic
[54:27] that you can mold you know that is not
[54:30] affected by water with a great value
[54:34] and it will be found in a gentle
[54:36] countries
[54:38] from among the gentiles will be taken
[54:40] and will be just say used for they build
[54:43] their
[54:43] sanctuary for god himself in the new
[54:45] testament
[54:46] amen in the days of summon he was
[54:50] looking for this
[54:51] great very value of fear goat
[54:55] and when he was imported he built up the
[54:58] place of the rest for great jehovah
[55:01] all those things was only a typing of
[55:03] the new testament
[55:04] and the hour we are living right now if
[55:06] you think that
[55:07] a certain generation will come or the
[55:10] age will come
[55:11] when all those things will be fulfilled
[55:14] that was predicted
[55:16] and and uh played as the prototype
[55:20] way before you are wrong
[55:24] because won't be any other generation we
[55:27] are living in the final generation
[55:29] this is the harvest time this is a
[55:31] golden age
[55:33] we came to the hour of zero
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:37] when the rocket must go this is hour of
[55:40] the rapture
[55:41] this is the hour where all the prophets
[55:43] and apostles predict they spoke about
[55:47] are pointing on the type of people will
[55:49] rise up in the last days
[55:51] without a spot without a wrinkle
[55:55] amen perfect group of people not in
[55:58] themselves
[56:00] but by the perfect word when you receive
[56:02] that perfect word you are as
[56:04] perfect as the word you received if you
[56:08] receive that
[56:09] particular word partition revelation
[56:11] that is
[56:12] all you can reflect but this is an hour
[56:15] of perfection
[56:17] amen amen
[56:21] amen so isaiah he saw
[56:26] the day he said i will make a man more
[56:29] precious than a fine gold
[56:31] gold is a deity in the bible you know
[56:33] that
[56:35] every one of you
[56:38] even from the sunday school even
[56:42] children know it
[56:44] the gold is a deity i will make
[56:48] a man like a deity not only jesus christ
[56:52] he was the first one but i will just
[56:55] manifest
[56:56] more like he is that's the reason he's a
[57:01] he's the firstborn among the brethren
[57:03] yes amen
[57:05] he calls us his brothers
[57:08] because we are coming from the same
[57:10] source
[57:12] we forgot it we lost the awareness of
[57:15] that
[57:16] but we are part of the same source which
[57:19] is a divine source
[57:21] god is the source of you and me
[57:24] as jesus he said i came from the father
[57:26] i'm coming back to the father
[57:28] you can say the same in that age you can
[57:31] say the same
[57:32] i'm coming from god i'm coming back to
[57:34] god
[57:35] this is a rapture season rapture time
[57:38] harvest time
[57:39] golden age when the man and god they
[57:41] became one

[1:03:44] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:03:46] without blame

[1:04:35] world
[1:04:36] and he protested me to be holy without
[1:04:39] blame
[1:04:40] having procrastinated us unto the
[1:04:42] adoption of
[1:04:43] children by jesus christ to himself
[1:04:47] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:04:50] will it was a good pleasure
[1:04:54] of his will we are not saved because we
[1:04:57] wanted to be saved
[1:04:59] we are not christians because we wanted
[1:05:02] to be christians
[1:05:03] we are christians because he has chosen
[1:05:05] us in himself
[1:05:08] it was according to good pleasure of his
[1:05:10] will that before you've been born
[1:05:13] he loved you he placed something into
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:17] he couldn't just love our human part but
[1:05:20] he placed his own seed
[1:05:22] into you and now when the city is open
[1:05:26] understanding came to you amnesia is
[1:05:28] move on

[1:05:37] the redemption
[1:05:39] how how the prize is enough
[1:05:43] how he conquered death how he made you
[1:05:46] overcomer
[1:05:47] all those things are in the bible but we
[1:05:50] have to read from the open book
[1:05:52] if we are under the cloud of
[1:05:54] condemnation you cannot see that
[1:05:57] because there is a power of the enemy
[1:06:00] holding you anytime you want to just
[1:06:03] make a step forward
[1:06:04] he holds you he gives you conditions
[1:06:08] he tells you explains the word of god
[1:06:10] you cannot do it this is not for you
[1:06:12] because you
[1:06:12] you you are not faithful you didn't do
[1:06:14] this you didn't do that
[1:06:17] but the gospel is not the gospel the
[1:06:19] real one is not the gospel of do's and
[1:06:21] don'ts

[1:25:22] to take the book and he took that book
[1:25:24] and he opened all
[1:25:26] the seven seals took it off
[1:25:30] open the book and hand it down to the
[1:25:33] seven messenger
[1:25:35] in revelation 10 7 he's starting to use
[1:25:38] the voice god is using the voice
[1:25:40] it's nothing to do with brother branham
[1:25:41] he was just a channel
[1:25:44] that yelled himself to the high
[1:25:46] intelligence
[1:25:48] that was the intelligence behind the
[1:25:49] trumpet trumpet is mute
[1:25:51] until his intelligence behind the
[1:25:53] instrument blowing
[1:25:55] giving a certain sound we got a certain
[1:25:59] sound
[1:26:00] of the gospel in the last days not
[1:26:02] joined to denomination
[1:26:04] not go from the church to church coming
[1:26:06] to christ
[1:26:07] the mystery of god god and the man
[1:26:09] became one revelation 10
[1:26:11] 7 mystery of god is finished
[1:26:16] what was the group in revelation 5 that
[1:26:19] responded for the open book
[1:26:21] there was a question answers on the
[1:26:23] seals
[1:26:26] and someone asked brad branham sunday
[1:26:30] morning
[1:26:31] 24th of march 1963. problem what kind of
[1:26:35] group it is in revelation 5.
[1:26:37] what kind of group he was so tired he
[1:26:40] was all the time
[1:26:41] privately you know he was tired two
[1:26:44] hours in the presence of the angel
[1:26:46] he was just breaking to seal or just
[1:26:48] give a revelation
[1:26:49] of the seal that the lamb in heaven
[1:26:51] broke down one by one
[1:26:53] he was tired so he said this is a
[1:26:55] heavenly group
[1:26:57] and then all of a sudden he felt to be
[1:26:59] condemned he said something is wrong in
[1:27:01] a congregation maybe someone is sick
[1:27:02] we're supposed to pray for someone
[1:27:04] what's wrong what's wrong
[1:27:06] the answer is not coming from heaven
[1:27:09] he doesn't know the answer brother he
[1:27:12] doesn't know the answer
[1:27:13] god is showing the transition the
[1:27:16] response is coming
[1:27:19] from the audience simple brother he says
[1:27:22] read the scripture again read
[1:27:25] again you read it once but now read it
[1:27:28] again in a new way
[1:27:32] an answer is coming for the bride
[1:27:35] because she's
[1:27:35] also part of death what is going on
[1:27:38] right now
[1:27:40] it's not only about blah blah he didn't
[1:27:42] know he was tired
[1:27:45] but he said read again he reads again
[1:27:48] revelation 5. he reads the scripture
[1:27:54] and he realized
[1:27:59] and they sung a new song saying thou
[1:28:02] are worthy to take the book and to open
[1:28:05] the seals thereof
[1:28:07] forth always slain and has redeemed
[1:28:10] us to god you redeem us to god
[1:28:14] it couldn't be heavenly group it
[1:28:17] couldn't be
[1:28:18] no angel no cherubim there is no
[1:28:21] redemption for angels
[1:28:24] when the angels to follow lucifer they
[1:28:28] were kicked out from heaven with the
[1:28:30] lucifer
[1:28:31] they became fallen angels there is no
[1:28:33] redemption for angels
[1:28:35] there is a redemption for you and me
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] you redeem us to god oh i would make a
[1:28:43] mistake he said
[1:28:45] if the holy spirit wouldn't be here holy
[1:28:48] spirit use the bride
[1:28:49] member of the bride read again he reads
[1:28:51] against the scripture and then the
[1:28:53] revelation strikes him
[1:28:54] it was not the heavenly group it was the
[1:28:57] bride
[1:28:58] it was you and me before you've been
[1:29:00] born

[1:29:12] i responded you redeem us there was a
[1:29:15] group
[1:29:16] of redeemed people revelation 5 the most
[1:29:19] profound scripture in the whole bible
[1:29:22] when jesus christ he paid the price in
[1:29:24] his first coming

[1:29:28] possession
[1:29:29] [Applause]
