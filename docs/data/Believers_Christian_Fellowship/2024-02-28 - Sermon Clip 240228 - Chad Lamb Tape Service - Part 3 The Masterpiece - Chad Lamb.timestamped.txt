[0:25] it'll I I'll have a masterpiece some of
[0:28] these days if I keep it right on this
[0:32] word praise God remember brother BM now
[0:36] went into the
[0:37] vision back here and he began to
[0:40] describe the vision of he saw the bride
[0:41] coming forth and when he began that he
[0:44] said I may not know the just the right
[0:47] interpretation and he begins talking and
[0:49] he saw the bride coming into preview and
[0:51] she was beautiful and she was perfect in
[0:52] every way and she passed off the scene
[0:55] and now the voice said now the church
[0:56] will come and he said all the vulgarity
[0:59] and the filth and his heart like to drop
[1:01] then the American Church came and he
[1:02] just couldn't take it anymore and and in
[1:05] other plac he said he just bowed his
[1:06] head and he wept and he couldn't take it
[1:09] and then they went off into chaos
[1:11] following a witch but then the voice
[1:13] said but the bride will come into
[1:14] preview once more and then he saw again
[1:18] the sweet faces and those clean women
[1:21] coming forth and and he began to
[1:22] describe the two one was completely
[1:24] uncovered and and and they were they
[1:27] were vulgar and filthy and they were led
[1:29] by which and they were moving and
[1:31] twisting to the wrong kind of music and
[1:33] and and they were uncovered because they
[1:35] didn't have the word all they had was a
[1:37] little gray the gray piece of paper that
[1:39] was cut to make a fly bush to expand it
[1:41] bigger than they was and that's just the
[1:43] Creeds and dogmas of man amen but when
[1:45] he saw the bride he said it's amazing he
[1:47] said she had long skirts and long
[1:50] sleeves what's he saying she was fully
[1:53] covered she was completely covered by
[1:55] the
[1:56] word amen and so and she was marching to
[2:01] Onward Christian Soldiers and and and
[2:04] then he says but I caught it right in my
[2:07] preaching today he didn't have the
[2:08] interpretation when he had the vision
[2:10] but while he's preaching he said I had
[2:12] that before I had these notes he said
[2:15] but I caught it in the preaching this
[2:16] morning it's the alpha omega principle
[2:19] it's the seed that went in and the seed
[2:21] at the end but nothing in between it was
[2:24] all just a carrier but it would all go
[2:26] to complete death the stalk the tossel
[2:29] the husk amen you would only have life
[2:31] at the beginning and life at the end the
[2:33] bride that went into the uh ground and
[2:35] the bride that come forth is the same
[2:37] bride it's the alpha omega
[2:41] principle aren't you glad you're not in
[2:43] the husk
[2:45] age you're not in a stalk age yeah
[2:48] you're not in a tossel age but God has
[2:51] brought us forth in the seed age the
[2:53] wheat age the life age oh I'm so
[2:56] thankful I'm not worthy of it I don't
[2:59] deserve it and I don't always act like
[3:00] it but I am so thankful for it and I'm
[3:03] not looking to myself but I'm looking to
[3:05] that hued out place at Calvary where he
[3:07] struck him at Calvary and brought me out
[3:10] and I know he's going to take me right
[3:11] back and it'll be a perfect fit when
[3:13] he's done polishing this
[3:15] Stone thank God
[3:18] Almighty
