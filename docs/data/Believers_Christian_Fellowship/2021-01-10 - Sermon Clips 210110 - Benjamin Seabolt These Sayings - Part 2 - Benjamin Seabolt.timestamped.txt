[0:00] here is a man that has laid in a bed for
[0:03] 38 years
[0:05] and there's now a man who has came along
[0:07] with the power to say take up thy bed
[0:09] and walk
[0:11] and instead of asking who is the man
[0:15] that made you
[0:16] whole they said who is the man that told
[0:19] you to carry your bad on bed on the
[0:21] sabbath day
[0:26] i mean i've been accused of being
[0:28] legalistic but
[0:29] i mean this is a whole other level
[0:33] of all things this i mean do we
[0:37] understand the fact pattern here this
[0:39] man's laid here for 38 years
[0:42] he's been made whole and the only thing
[0:43] that they can think to ask him
[0:45] is who's told you to come and bust up
[0:47] our denominational thinking
[0:50] who has told you to come and throw a
[0:53] wrench into our tradition
[0:54] our traditional sunday service
[0:58] who has who has asked who has told you
[1:01] to do these things
[1:05] not wilt thou who has told you and made
[1:08] you whole
[1:10] they won't ask you that they want to
[1:11] know who's disturbing things
[1:14] who is threatening our position who is
[1:16] going to put us out of a job if this be
[1:18] so
[1:20] i'm not concerned that you've been made
[1:21] whole what i'm concerned about is my
[1:24] self-security
[1:26] and how many how many in here can relate
[1:29] to that when the message of the hour
[1:31] came your way
[1:32] [Music]
[1:34] the people that you thought well
[1:36] everybody will see this
[1:38] everybody will love this will
[1:41] will thou be made whole you're just
[1:43] chucking that out to everybody you come
[1:45] to will thou be made whole like i've
[1:47] been made whole well that'll be made
[1:48] whole like
[1:49] like i've been made whole and they've
[1:50] known you they've known me
[1:53] and they've known that you've laid their
[1:55] important for 38 years
[1:57] maybe not 38 years you put your own
[1:59] number in there
[2:00] but of all things they just can't seem
[2:04] to ask
[2:04] how is it that you have been made whole
[2:07] they want to know
[2:08] why are you trying to cause this
[2:11] confliction in my life by presenting
[2:13] this cult to me
[2:14] by presenting this false doctrine to me
[2:16] what what is your problem
[2:18] where are these radical who has told you
[2:21] this
[2:22] who has told you to come and disturb my
[2:24] traditional sunday plans
[2:30] they don't say yes please make me whole
[2:33] they want to know who is causing this
[2:35] disturbance
[2:37] why are you doing this to me
[2:40] see if we can't discern the spirits
[2:44] within the framework of the christian
[2:46] church we will so easily be caught into
[2:48] that
[2:49] because the question they asked they had
[2:51] scripture for
[2:53] the question they asked was not a what
[2:55] we would say a wrong question it was a
[2:57] very scriptural question
[2:59] the problem was they missed the point
