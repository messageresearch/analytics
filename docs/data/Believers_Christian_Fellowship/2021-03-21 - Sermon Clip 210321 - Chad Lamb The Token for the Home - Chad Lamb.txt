TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you understand what we have in this day the word interpreted we've got the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication we have the word interpreted the word interpret is the manifestation of the name amen and it didn't change the name the name is still jesus christ we still pronounce it the same amen but it doesn't have the same effect now it comes with the life with the full revelation because with the full word his name is in the word when we have the word for our season and for our day it brings the life with it and now when we say that name it has life behind it because the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god not that somehow we secretly get a new pronunciation and if you hold your mouth right and say it rest right and it's the same name that we've known all through the church ages amen but now he comes in the fuller it is the mighty god unveiled before us it is god who has taken the veil off the mystery of god is now revealed and the interpretation of the word is the manifestation of the name of god and now we've got something more than a pronunciation we've got an understanding we've got a knowing we have a personal knowledge of jesus christ he's been made personal to us he's revealed personally to us and the in the name is in the word see we're talking about the token is for the home amen when we go to our homes and establish our homes on the token it's not hocus pocus it's not incantation it's not enchantments amen it's not well i believe the message everything's fine no it's got you got to have this word you've got to have this life amen it's got to be on display there's got to be an application of this life and when it's on display then the death angel will pass it's got to be real it's got to be genuine it's got to be the reality of the message not a not an acknowledgement of the message and not not being friends with the message but it's got to actually the message has got to be alive inside of you because his name is in the word i mean there's all kinds of token words given and i believe brother there was a prophet i believe this and i believe that but there's absolutely no manifestation of the life and if there's no manifestation of the life there is no guard against the day of destruction friends but it's got to be an application of the life that is on display
