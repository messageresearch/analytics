[5:09] for every gathering lord to us is a
[5:11] privilege and every opportunity we have
[5:13] lord we come with expectation to hear
[5:16] from you
[5:17] i pray god you would take over lord that

[5:21] come yourself and break the bread of
[5:23] life for you've promised to feed us on

[5:27] have need of lord
[5:28] god we pray you would take control and
[5:30] have preeminence lord and may we
[5:32] constantly be yielding unto you a
[5:34] greater preeminence that you might
[5:36] accomplish your purpose through us
[5:38] in this world in this hour that we live
[5:41] for without you we can do nothing
[5:43] we ask your blessings over the word now
[5:45] in jesus christ's name we pray
[5:48] amen
[5:49] amen let's take our bibles and look at
[5:51] romans chapter 4
[5:53] as we get started
[5:59] amen
[6:00] i trust everybody had a wonderful
[6:01] thanksgiving
[6:03] and i had two really nice days to spend
[6:05] with my family and so i really
[6:07] appreciated that and value that very
[6:08] much and we had a good time
[6:11] and then also i wanted to let you know
[6:13] that reminder that brother jean kadema
[6:16] is away ministering today
[6:18] in pittsburgh so we'd remember him today
[6:20] and also next weekend brother ben siebel
[6:23] will be traveling up to brother dan
[6:25] ratliffs in michigan near ann arbor and
[6:27] taking a saturday and a sunday service
[6:30] so that'll be december 4th and december
[6:33] 5th and brother
[6:34] dan and the assembly there have got a
[6:36] new church and they can fit more people
[6:38] so if some of you want to go up for the
[6:40] saturday service you're welcome and
[6:42] there's room
[6:44] but don't forget you're where your post
[6:45] of duty is on sunday
[6:48] amen but that'd be nice if someone were
[6:50] able to make it and support brother ben
[6:52] and support the church up there so i
[6:54] just want to remind you of that
[6:56] amen let's read romans chapter 4 and
[6:59] then we'll be seated
[7:00] romans chapter 4
[7:02] verse 16
[7:05] therefore it is of faith that it might
[7:07] be by grace to the end the promise might
[7:09] be sure
[7:11] to all the seed not to that only which
[7:13] is of the law
[7:14] but that also which is of the faith of
[7:16] abraham who is the father of us all
[7:19] god bless you as you're seated and may
[7:21] the lord add his blessing
[7:22] to the reading of his word
[7:24] amen
[7:26] i wanted to just first talk to you for a
[7:28] minute about the email that we sent out
[7:30] we saw an email letting everybody know
[7:32] that we had had three uh individuals in
[7:35] the assembly test positive for kovid
[7:37] over the last week so we just sent that
[7:39] out as information so everybody would
[7:41] have the information they need to make
[7:44] their choice and so i just wanted to
[7:46] talk about that for a minute i was
[7:48] speaking with brother jeremy sanders and
[7:50] he said this is the new norm
[7:52] and i think we've learned and come to
[7:54] realize that covet wasn't going to be a
[7:56] blip on the map and go away like we
[7:58] thought it was amen it may go away yet i
[8:01] believe it will whatever i don't know
[8:02] what it will do but anyways
[8:04] we see waves we see things go we see it
[8:07] come we see numbers reduced numbers
[8:09] increase we see variants and mutations
[8:11] and
[8:12] open borders and closed borders and this
[8:15] is the world we live in friends
[8:17] this is the way things are god has
[8:18] allowed it but as i reflect on it i
[8:20] believe god has allowed it for our
[8:22] maturing amen god has allowed it for the
[8:25] perfection of our faith because you know
[8:27] we're not able
[8:29] we are not able to get out of this world
[8:32] yet and we're not able to leave these
[8:34] bodies yet because this is the way life
[8:36] is and for us you know we have a promise
[8:40] we have a promise of healing so covet is
[8:42] not a frightening thing for us on an
[8:44] individual level but it affects every
[8:46] other facet of our life amen for some
[8:49] people it is it becomes very uh
[8:51] complicated with a work situation or
[8:54] they may have a family member in a
[8:57] nursing home and you got to get in and
[8:58] out of that nursing home and to get in
[9:00] and out of the nursing home you have to
[9:02] answer a questionnaire you have to have
[9:04] a your temperature taken and
[9:06] and you know i don't think any of us
[9:08] have got such a seared conscience that
[9:10] we can go see grandma and lie every
[9:12] question on the questionnaire
[9:14] right so we are affected by these things
[9:17] we have work situations we have
[9:20] unbelieving family members that create
[9:22] situations there's there's complexity to
[9:25] this issue amen this is not just a do we
[9:28] believe god issue we believe god amen do
[9:30] we fear covet no we don't fear covet
[9:32] we've seen god work miraculously for us
[9:35] in this assembly we've seen god's
[9:37] healing power the blood that was shed at
[9:39] calvary is sufficient for all diseases
[9:42] so we're confident in that and it's not
[9:44] a lack of confidence but we do also have
[9:46] to understand the world we live in and
[9:48] the complication that certain
[9:50] individuals have for some of us it's no
[9:52] big deal we're self-employed we just
[9:54] spend time with each other and our
[9:56] families we you know
[9:58] i mean if you're a single man who's
[10:00] self-employed hey you know do whatever
[10:02] you know but we've got all kinds of
[10:05] intermingling where we mingle out into
[10:08] all kinds of different scenarios and if
[10:10] and if we would end up if there's
[10:12] certain ones among us if we would end up
[10:14] with covet and we would test positive it
[10:16] would create a real hardship and a
[10:17] difficulty for us and maybe other people
[10:20] so as a church you know as the lord
[10:22] leads we'll just do as the lord leads
[10:24] but for me i feel to continue to go on
[10:26] and have service because we're all
[10:28] exposed to covet all the time amen it's
[10:30] in the community it's in the grocery
[10:32] stores it's in the doctor's offices it's
[10:34] everywhere amen and not to say that some
[10:37] things may get more serious we may have
[10:38] to take a different action at a
[10:40] different time we'll let god lead in
[10:42] that we don't have all the answers
[10:44] because we don't know all the
[10:46] circumstances
[10:47] but for me i just believe we'll continue
[10:49] on
[10:50] and everybody knows their situation
[10:54] we can't make a decision as a body we're
[10:56] all going to do this those days are over
[10:58] with
[10:59] this is about an individual walking
[11:01] before god finding god's leadership in
[11:03] their life
[11:04] you know your workplace
[11:06] you know whether you got to get in out
[11:08] of that hospital or in and out of that
[11:10] nursing home you know i mean what if you
[11:12] have travel plans
[11:14] i'll tell you a funny story we were
[11:17] going to oregon
[11:18] and just a little bit before we went to
[11:20] oregon i went to the hospital to visit
[11:22] brother john matthews and john matthews
[11:25] had coveted he was in the hospital with
[11:27] a serious case of covid and i had to get
[11:29] dressed up like a surgeon going in for
[11:32] surgery so he put all the equipment on
[11:34] went in prayed with him visited with him
[11:35] was in there for maybe 20 minutes left
[11:38] and we go to take the flight to go to
[11:41] oregon and there's a questionnaire you
[11:44] know if i flight i was flying delta that
[11:46] time and the questionnaire have you been
[11:48] in contact with anybody with covid in
[11:51] the last 10 days and i had to answer i'm
[11:54] at a kiosk i'm answering it for six
[11:56] people so i'm just in there yes yes yes
[11:58] no no no and i do the same thing for
[12:00] everybody we go to security we get
[12:02] through the gate and brianna goes dad
[12:05] you were in the hospital with john
[12:07] matthews i was like
[12:11] did i lie
[12:13] it really started bothering me but thank
[12:15] god i did the math and it had been like
[12:16] 12 or 14 days amen everything was honest
[12:19] everything was straightforward
[12:21] and what we realized is god looked after
[12:23] us
[12:24] because we were in post god's post of
[12:26] duty we were doing what god called us to
[12:28] do he looked after us
[12:30] but you know something that i wouldn't
[12:31] have been able to do myself is go to
[12:34] that questionnaire and lie
[12:36] and get on that plane because my
[12:39] conscience is too tender for that some
[12:41] people have gotten a little bit higher
[12:42] level
[12:44] than me
[12:46] but i'm not there yet i'm too tender
[12:48] so so we realized that these things can
[12:52] be complicated amen
[12:54] and there's there's different reasons
[12:56] that some people have some people have
[12:57] to be more careful than others for
[12:59] different reasons amen and i don't ever
[13:01] want it to become an issue of one
[13:04] believer has more faith than another
[13:06] believer i hope we're beyond that
[13:08] that's nonsense
[13:10] because really this is an individual
[13:12] walk this isn't about a church walk
[13:14] anymore this is about me walking before
[13:16] god
[13:18] and so that's one of those issues where
[13:20] i was in total ignorance but god already
[13:21] looked after me god already took care of
[13:23] it
[13:24] but
[13:25] we can become
[13:27] brash and we can become bold and
[13:29] arrogant and do things anyways knowing
[13:32] the consequences knowing that i have to
[13:34] get on that flight and answer those
[13:35] questions but i'm doing it anyways i'm
[13:38] i'm serving god i'm doing i don't care
[13:40] about that stupid covid
[13:43] you can call it stupid all you want but
[13:44] spitting at it will not make it go away
[13:47] and won't change the circumstances and
[13:50] won't change the consequences
[13:52] we can call covet names but i don't
[13:54] think it hurts covets feelings
[13:57] we can act and many times we act
[14:00] arrogantly and we act with bravado and
[14:03] brashness thinking that's faith and many
[14:05] times that's not faith at all
[14:08] faith can be honest
[14:12] faith can be honest faith can say this
[14:14] is the situation
[14:16] this is what they'll ask me this is the
[14:18] situation this is what i need to do
[14:21] i mean that's mature faith childish
[14:23] faith is calling names and spitting and
[14:25] saying i don't care that's childish
[14:28] but god has not called us to be children
[14:30] this is the bright age where we come to
[14:32] full maturity rapturing faith in a
[14:34] rapturing condition we can't play games
[14:36] in a childish way and
[14:38] call names and spit at things and defy
[14:41] authorities and lie on questionnaires
[14:43] and
[14:45] is that am i the only one who believes
[14:47] that
[14:49] so
[14:50] so for me
[14:51] it comes down to to those kind of
[14:54] situations and we you know
[14:56] we've had we've heard so many things all
[14:58] of us over the last two years we've
[15:00] heard
[15:01] conspiracy theories and ideas and
[15:04] political nonsense and the news has
[15:07] changed the narrative multiple times
[15:09] science has changed their mind
[15:11] one thing i know is there's uncertainty
[15:13] everywhere and we have no idea what will
[15:15] happen next
[15:16] but i know god will lead through it all
[15:18] and i'm confident he'll take care of his
[15:20] children and we just need to be honest
[15:23] we need to be responsible you know when
[15:28] our our children all had a cold
[15:30] they've all been suffering with a cold
[15:32] one by one they've all got it but when
[15:34] we heard somebody somebody in the
[15:35] assembly had covered the last one of our
[15:38] children to be sick was brooke so i told
[15:40] angie to take brook to get a test
[15:42] knowing there's consequences for the
[15:44] information but we can say
[15:47] we can act this way ignorance is bliss
[15:51] ignorance is bliss
[15:52] but ignorance is not responsible
[15:55] because i'm not a single man off by
[15:58] myself can skip a week of services and
[16:00] nobody'll notice we have we interact
[16:02] with everybody and who we interact with
[16:04] we can affect their lives
[16:07] in minor ways or in great ways so we
[16:09] don't have the option i don't have the
[16:12] option of being ignorant
[16:14] i have to take the option of being
[16:15] responsible
[16:17] but thank god our test came back
[16:18] negative
[16:20] amen in fact she wasn't able to get the
[16:22] rapid test she got the longer one and it
[16:24] goes back and it shows if you've had
[16:26] anything in the last 30 to 90 days and
[16:28] it tests for flu and for covid and she's
[16:31] clear of all of it
[16:33] so once again god took care of us god
[16:36] watched out for us we don't have to
[16:38] pretend
[16:40] and fake and bluff and say god took care
[16:42] of me we can be honest and let god take
[16:44] care of us we can be straightforward
[16:47] honest
[16:48] and god can take care of us
[16:51] you know knowing that if that test would
[16:53] have come back positive we would had a
[16:55] really difficult situation this morning
[16:57] i would have had to quarantine for
[16:58] whatever the quarantined period is
[17:00] missed some services made other
[17:01] arrangements it would have been
[17:02] inconvenient for ourselves and many
[17:05] other people
[17:06] but what if we just decided to ignore
[17:09] that
[17:10] you say well god will take care of it
[17:12] god always takes care of us
[17:14] but you know we understand how the law
[17:16] of gravity works does everybody
[17:18] understand how law of gravity works
[17:21] so it would we could climb up to the top
[17:24] of a tower and say god i want you to
[17:25] prove that your purpose for me is not
[17:27] finished because the prophet said that
[17:29] you'll never leave this earth till god's
[17:31] purpose for you is finished i'm jumping
[17:33] off to prove that i'm still in your
[17:34] purpose
[17:36] guess what if your time's not done
[17:38] god will take care of you you will
[17:39] survive that crash
[17:42] but he also may let you deal with the
[17:43] consequences of falling off of a tower
[17:46] you may wish you were dead by the time
[17:48] you hit the bottom
[17:51] because we live in this dimension god
[17:54] placed us here we can't escape it
[17:57] we have people with who've had heart
[17:59] catheterizations people sitting here
[18:01] with stents we've had knee replacements
[18:03] hip replacement shoulder replacements
[18:05] we've had cataracts removed we've had
[18:07] linda's put in our eyes we've had this
[18:09] that and the other
[18:11] this is the reality friends
[18:13] this is where we live we don't fear any
[18:15] of those things but you deal with them
[18:16] we live here this is the world we deal
[18:18] with so we can climb up to the top of
[18:20] the tower jump off and say i'm going to
[18:23] prove that god's purpose for me is not
[18:24] done if he's not done you'll survive
[18:27] but god may let you limp the rest of
[18:29] your life as a reminder that you don't
[18:31] tempt god
[18:33] we're going to be honest so as we move
[18:35] forward we don't know what will happen
[18:37] we don't know what another wave another
[18:39] cycle we don't know what a new strain
[18:42] might do
[18:43] but we know we work with people who are
[18:45] frightened we know we live in a world
[18:47] that's complex and we know whatever
[18:49] challenge we have to face
[18:51] we can face them with honesty
[18:54] responsibility
[18:56] faith and integrity and the very life of
[18:59] god can be on display and there's
[19:01] nothing that we have to fear so we don't
[19:03] have to fake we don't have to bluff we
[19:06] don't have to pretend that's not faith
[19:10] faith is dealing with the circumstances
[19:12] as they are in dealing with the reality
[19:14] as it is
[19:16] and so i i pray that god brings us to
[19:19] that level
[19:20] of maturity
[19:22] for instance the sharibi family is
[19:24] leaving
[19:25] in a little over a week to go back to
[19:27] uganda to visit their family it's an
[19:30] important trip for them they've been
[19:31] gone from home for a long time their
[19:33] family has grown since they're gone they
[19:35] want to go back and see all the parents
[19:37] the aunts the uncles the cousins and all
[19:39] of that amen but but you know they live
[19:42] in a world there's a reality to this
[19:44] world and they know that if something
[19:46] happens they could jeopardize that trip
[19:49] it's not a fear of govid it's the
[19:52] reality of the circumstances that covet
[19:54] has created
[19:56] amen
[19:57] you know many of us if we haven't yet
[19:59] many of us are going to have to face a
[20:01] vaccination mandate
[20:03] one way or another many have already
[20:05] faced it many are in the process of work
[20:08] you know coming up with the rules and
[20:09] figuring out what they're going to do
[20:11] that is an individual decision that you
[20:14] have to find the leadership of going on
[20:16] nobody can tell you to do it nobody can
[20:19] tell you not to do it you have to ask
[20:21] the lord what should we do many have
[20:23] already had the vaccination many will
[20:25] yet get it there's there's folks who
[20:28] have family that live in canada if they
[20:30] want to see their family they have to
[20:31] have a vaccine
[20:33] you can call covet stupid all you want
[20:36] but if you're going to go see your
[20:37] family you have to have a vaccine
[20:39] that's the law of the land so we we have
[20:42] to deal with the situation and ask god
[20:44] what do you want gone
[20:46] people say i'm not afraid of covert but
[20:48] you're afraid of a vaccine
[20:51] so you're still afraid
[20:54] at the end of day you're still motivated
[20:55] by fear i say let faith lead the way
[20:58] amen the way god leads me what i'm
[21:01] comfortable with i don't feel checked in
[21:02] my spirit i know this is my god's
[21:04] leading for me just let god lead amen
[21:07] and let god lead everybody else
[21:11] i hope that we can come to a level of
[21:12] maturity where one person can say i feel
[21:15] like god led me to get the vaccine and
[21:16] stay in the job i'm at and not quit my
[21:18] job because i feel like god put me there
[21:20] supernaturally and hasn't told me to
[21:22] leave
[21:23] and they're requiring this or i lose my
[21:25] employment i've prayed about it and god
[21:27] hasn't given me the green light to quit
[21:29] so i'm going to submit to the master
[21:31] that i'm under
[21:33] and the next person can say god led me
[21:35] not to do that i'm going to quit and get
[21:36] another job and can we come to a level
[21:39] of maturity where we say they are both
[21:40] right
[21:43] that your decision does not cause me to
[21:46] doubt my decision my decision shouldn't
[21:48] cause you to doubt your decision that
[21:50] we've come to a level of individual
[21:53] maturity and faith before god that i can
[21:55] do as god leads me you can do as god
[21:58] leads you and we can both say god bless
[22:00] you i think you're right
[22:03] so as we move forward we just continue
[22:06] to have church as much as possible
[22:08] unless god leads another way and
[22:10] everybody will have to decide what they
[22:12] need to do based off their situation and
[22:15] so god just bless you and god keep
[22:16] feeding us hey god's been taking care of
[22:19] us amen
[22:20] we've got many many testimonies and of
[22:23] supernatural deliverance and god really
[22:25] taking care of us for us to fear
[22:27] anything
[22:28] so let's just move forward in faith and
[22:30] let god lead
[22:32] when
[22:33] brother kyle called me yesterday to let
[22:35] me know that kerry had tested positive
[22:37] she just had a cold but all of a sudden
[22:39] she lost her sense of taste and smell so
[22:41] they went in and got a test immediately
[22:43] and then i had already started on my
[22:45] notes he called me
[22:47] midday yesterday and i'd already started
[22:49] on my notes and i looked down at my
[22:51] title and the title was the maturing of
[22:53] abraham's faith
[22:56] said god this is for the maturing of our
[22:58] faith
[22:59] amen god is using all circumstances to
[23:03] really get us to grow up amen
[23:06] we thought we were mature but we look
[23:07] back and we say that was childish
[23:10] amen and right now we may feel all big
[23:12] and grown up my question is how will we
[23:14] feel 10 years from now if there's a 10
[23:16] years from now
[23:17] i say god i need you every hour to lead
[23:20] me and to mature me
[23:23] so
[23:23] we we've been preaching before the
[23:25] meetings on the seat of the seat of
[23:28] promise the seat of abraham
[23:30] things like that i thought that the
[23:32] meeting
[23:33] i thought that the meetings would break
[23:35] my chain of inspiration i'd go to
[23:36] something different after the meetings
[23:38] but i was wrong amen so we're going to
[23:40] pick up and look at abraham but for a
[23:42] title i titled the this the maturing of
[23:45] abraham's faith and i just in the bible
[23:47] study want to follow along to the life
[23:49] of abraham and watch how god
[23:52] brings abraham through amen and brings
[23:55] him to
[23:56] what i would say is a level of perfect
[23:58] faith and i want to look at that today
[24:01] we know that abraham we read here in
[24:03] romans chapter 4 verse 16 that abraham
[24:06] is the father of faith for us amen and
[24:09] we who have the faith of abraham are the
[24:12] seed of abraham
[24:13] so we're following in abraham's
[24:15] footsteps so we want to take the nature
[24:18] of the father of faith amen we want to
[24:20] be children of faith so we want to look
[24:22] at abraham's faith
[24:24] brother branham says in the message to
[24:25] patriarch abraham
[24:27] he said we're facing now a grand text
[24:30] tonight the patriarch abraham
[24:32] which was called the father of the faith
[24:34] because that god made him the promise to
[24:36] inherit the earth and his seed and it's
[24:39] through abraham we being dead in christ
[24:41] become abraham's seed and are heirs with
[24:44] him according to the promise
[24:46] so we he is the father of the faith
[24:49] we're the seed of abraham we're children
[24:51] by faith
[24:52] i want to look at ephesians before we
[24:55] move any further
[24:56] ephesians chapter 2.
[25:10] ephesians chapter 2
[25:12] verse 8.
[25:15] for by grace are you saved through faith
[25:17] in that not of yourselves
[25:19] it is the gift of god
[25:21] amen i titled this the maturing of
[25:23] abraham's faith
[25:25] but i didn't know what else to title it
[25:27] but we know abraham's faith was a faith
[25:29] that god gave him amen and we know that
[25:31] we have faith our faith is a gift from
[25:34] god amen but so when i talk about the
[25:36] maturing of faith when god gives faith
[25:39] amen that's that's sufficient so when i
[25:42] talk about the maturing of faith that's
[25:43] only from our perspective but but really
[25:46] what i'm talking about is god amen
[25:49] getting more of abraham out of the way
[25:52] so that that faith can be expressed amen
[25:54] so the maturing of our faith is really
[25:57] the changing in our attitude and and
[25:59] changing in our reaction in the way we
[26:02] deal with situations to leave ourselves
[26:04] out of it so that that faith can be
[26:06] expressed amen so when god gave faith he
[26:08] already gave us a mature faith
[26:11] but it's shrouded in this body amen and
[26:14] underneath this intellect and this mind
[26:16] reasoning and all the senses that we
[26:18] have and we we learn as we go how to
[26:21] deny thought how to deny emotion how to
[26:24] deny our eyesight and the circumstances
[26:26] to let this faith really take the lead
[26:28] amen
[26:29] and so that's what we're looking at and
[26:31] talking about this morning let's go to
[26:34] genesis chapter 11
[26:36] and we'll begin back here in genesis and
[26:38] stay here primarily
[26:48] genesis chapter 11.
[26:53] verse 31 when we when we got that uh
[26:56] covet test and it came back negative i
[26:59] said huh you can still have a cold
[27:04] i didn't realize it was possible still
[27:06] to get a cold
[27:08] so we know i know of about four people
[27:10] who have had that cold and got tested
[27:12] and got negative results so there's a
[27:14] cold going around through but i thought
[27:16] it's amazing we have proof you can still
[27:17] have a cold
[27:19] not everything is covered praise god
[27:22] the old sicknesses are back amen
[27:25] i never thought we'd be happy about that
[27:28] amen
[27:29] god is good friends
[27:31] god is good
[27:33] genesis chapter 11
[27:35] verse 31
[27:38] and tara took abraham his son and lot
[27:40] the son of heron his son's son and sarai
[27:43] his daughter-in-law his son abram's wife
[27:46] and they went forth with them from ur of
[27:48] the chaldees to go into the land of
[27:50] canaan and they came into heron and
[27:52] dwelt there
[27:54] and the days of terror were 205 years
[27:58] and tara died in heron
[28:00] i want you to that i want you to look at
[28:02] this scripture
[28:04] and it says tara which was abraham's
[28:05] father took abraham his son and lot and
[28:09] their spouses and they went from er
[28:13] unto heroin now this is really important
[28:17] as we move on because you'll find that
[28:20] that
[28:21] they're making a move and this move is
[28:24] critical to god's calling for abraham
[28:27] but the bible says that tara took them
[28:29] and went terror was still in the lead
[28:31] terror was still the father he was still
[28:33] making the decision amen but then while
[28:36] they're inherent terror died right
[28:39] so let's look at chapter 12 verse 1.
[28:43] now the lord had said unto abram get
[28:46] thee out of thy country and from thy
[28:48] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[28:51] a land that i will show thee brother
[28:53] brennan takes the scripture and he shows
[28:54] us that god had called him before not in
[28:57] heron but when he was in ur god had
[28:59] called him and told him to separate he
[29:02] said get out of thy country from thy
[29:05] kindred from thy father's house unto a
[29:08] land that i will show thee so god when
[29:11] he not hearing heron but god
[29:13] now the lord had said unto abram he's
[29:16] talking about something he told abraham
[29:17] previously so when abraham was in ur
[29:19] because this is what the prophet tells
[29:21] us that he called him while he was in ur
[29:23] and he told him
[29:24] leave your country leave your kin folks
[29:27] leave your father's house and come to a
[29:29] place where i call you amen and we know
[29:32] that abraham believed that
[29:35] is that true
[29:36] god told us abraham he had a gift of
[29:38] faith and when abraham heard the voice
[29:40] of god he believed god was calling him
[29:43] to leave and to go to this land amen but
[29:46] the initial action showed that there was
[29:49] still a lot of abraham mixed in and over
[29:52] shrouding this faith because he believed
[29:54] the word of the lord and he must and
[29:56] this is just me he must have shared that
[29:59] with his father hey father you know
[30:00] we've got to go i've got to go and his
[30:03] father said okay let's go and tara still
[30:07] in the lead amen takes abraham and abram
[30:10] at this time and his wife and lot and
[30:12] all their possessions and they move up
[30:14] to heron because they're moving up out
[30:16] of mesopotamia up north to cross over
[30:19] amen into the promised land so now tara
[30:22] is taking the lead it's not that abraham
[30:25] doesn't believe the word of god amen but
[30:27] abraham he
[30:29] it's still working out right
[30:31] we're still going in that direction i
[30:33] know god said leave leave leave but but
[30:36] dad wants to go too it's okay right
[30:39] the reason i say it this way is because
[30:41] when we look back on our lives this is
[30:43] exactly how our lives go
[30:46] we believe the word of the lord when we
[30:48] heard the message we believed it amen
[30:50] but but we reacted to it in such an
[30:52] immature way amen but god through time
[30:56] is developing abraham and bringing
[30:57] abraham into his word and into his
[31:00] promise and dealing with all abraham's
[31:03] situations until the word is completely
[31:06] confirmed amen and abraham comes into
[31:08] the reality of that word
[31:11] so now i read it again the lord had said
[31:13] unto abram get thee out of thy country
[31:16] from thy kindred from thy father's house
[31:18] unto a land that i will show thee and i
[31:21] will make of thee a great nation and i
[31:23] will bless thee and make thy name great
[31:25] and thou shalt be a blessing
[31:28] and i will bless them that blessed thee
[31:30] and cursed him that curseth thee and in
[31:32] thee shall all the families of the earth
[31:34] be blessed
[31:35] so abram departed
[31:38] as the lord had spoken unto him and lot
[31:40] went with him and abram was 75 years old
[31:43] when he departed out of heron
[31:46] now the initial call was to separate
[31:48] from country kinfolk father's house but
[31:51] we know then after that commission tara
[31:54] takes them to heroin but in god's grace
[31:57] in god's mercy and god watching over his
[31:59] promise he allows tara to die
[32:03] that wasn't an act of abraham's
[32:05] tremendous faith that was god amen
[32:08] bringing about his own word in abraham's
[32:10] life
[32:12] that was god being true to his promise
[32:14] that was god being merciful to abraham
[32:17] that was god watching over his word that
[32:20] was not a result of abraham's tremendous
[32:23] faith although abraham believed the word
[32:25] of god from the very beginning
[32:29] how many of you can look back over your
[32:31] life and say i believe the message when
[32:32] i heard it
[32:34] but i carried a lot of nonsense with me
[32:36] for a long time
[32:38] but by god's grace he would bring he
[32:41] would begin to remove nonsense from me
[32:43] amen
[32:44] different relationships would fade away
[32:46] amen churches would break up people
[32:48] would go different directions
[32:50] it wasn't your tremendous faith that
[32:53] made all of that happen it was the mercy
[32:54] of god to keep his promise to you and
[32:57] keep moving you into the word of god
[33:01] so we watch how god's dealing with
[33:02] abraham because we're the children of
[33:04] faith and the way that god deals with
[33:06] the father of faith is how he's dealing
[33:08] with the children of faith and we can
[33:10] have confidence in one thing that i'm
[33:12] saved by grace
[33:15] through faith and that not on myself it
[33:17] is the gift of god i've done a lot of
[33:19] things amen that i realize now weren't
[33:22] according to that faith amen but i still
[33:25] believed god and god still worked it out
[33:29] you know when when the scripture says in
[33:32] verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram
[33:35] amen it gives us no prerequisite
[33:38] condition on abraham's part
[33:42] god did not say because abraham was
[33:44] found righteous
[33:46] god did not say because he was a good
[33:48] man
[33:50] this is pure raw election
[33:54] brother branham says their family was
[33:57] still caught up in idolatry that took
[33:59] place in babylon and the family tara
[34:02] came down from babylon and brought the
[34:04] family from babylon
[34:06] to er and and brought many of those
[34:09] practices from babylon to earth god was
[34:12] calling abraham out of hedonistic
[34:15] uh heathenistic paganistic multi-god
[34:18] religion
[34:20] and abraham was raised in this he was
[34:23] stuck in this and god was not calling
[34:25] abraham because abraham had merit he was
[34:28] not calling abraham because of conduct
[34:30] he was calling abraham because of the
[34:32] election he had before the foundation of
[34:34] the world he was to somebody who's just
[34:36] like everybody else amen and he says you
[34:41] you're the one
[34:42] get thee out of this land leave the
[34:45] country leave thy kindred leave thy
[34:47] father's house and i'm going to make out
[34:49] of you a great nation and everybody that
[34:51] blesses you will be blessed and
[34:52] everybody that curses you will be cursed
[34:54] and all the nations of the world will be
[34:57] blessed in thee
[35:00] can you imagine abraham what did i do is
[35:02] like mary with a virgin mary she's going
[35:04] to the well to fetch water like she did
[35:06] every day she's a spouse to a man to be
[35:08] married she's as common as common can be
[35:10] and all of a sudden an angel shows up
[35:12] and says hey thou blessed highly
[35:14] favorite of the lord yes
[35:17] it's like gideon gideon is behind he's
[35:20] hiding behind the wine press threshing
[35:22] out wheat amen because the philistines
[35:25] are the keep coming and taking their
[35:27] wheat amen and an angel shows up and
[35:29] said behold thou mighty man of valor
[35:33] mighty man of valor was hiding behind a
[35:36] wine press threshing out a little wheat
[35:38] to hide it amen from the from the
[35:40] canaanites so that they wouldn't take it
[35:42] from them
[35:44] he didn't know he was a mighty man of
[35:46] valor mary didn't know she was highly
[35:48] favored of the lord abraham didn't know
[35:50] he was chosen to be the father of faith
[35:53] neither did you and i know amen when we
[35:55] started our journey in this life we
[35:57] didn't know that we were the seed of
[35:58] abraham we didn't know that we were the
[36:00] children of god elect and four known
[36:02] before the foundation of the world but
[36:04] god came to us in whatever condition he
[36:06] found us in
[36:09] in whatever condition he found us and he
[36:12] come to us and said you're one of them
[36:18] and then
[36:19] there was something in us
[36:22] that believed what we heard
[36:24] just like there was something in abraham
[36:26] that could believe what god told him
[36:28] there was something in us that believed
[36:30] what we heard and now we were believers
[36:34] now abraham
[36:37] from that point on was a believer
[36:41] but abraham did conduct did not always
[36:44] demonstrate that he believed what god
[36:46] told him
[36:49] do you agree with me
[36:52] he told abraham leave your father's
[36:53] house leave your kinder leave your
[36:54] country
[36:55] and all of a sudden tara says okay good
[36:57] idea boy let's go
[37:00] and what's abraham going to do this is
[37:02] his father he he knows what god said but
[37:04] now his father throw him along and can
[37:06] you imagine the pickle he was in
[37:09] many of us have been in pickles before
[37:12] everybody's going this way but god wants
[37:14] us to go this way we don't know what to
[37:16] do and sometimes we've allowed that to
[37:18] sweep us into something we shouldn't
[37:19] have got swept into
[37:22] but somewhere along the line god in his
[37:24] mercy broke that thing apart so that we
[37:26] could get back to where he wanted us to
[37:28] be
[37:30] this when we talk about the faith of
[37:32] abraham amen we're not talking about
[37:35] abraham being a a giant of faith of his
[37:38] own will of his own mind we're talking
[37:41] about a man who who god had planted a
[37:43] seed of faith god come and called god
[37:46] instructed god watched over god
[37:48] protected god moved god changed
[37:50] circumstances god did it all he gave him
[37:53] the promise then god kept his own
[37:55] promise
[37:56] even when abraham wasn't doing a
[37:58] thorough job god still kept his promise
[38:01] to abraham
[38:03] brother branham said this was the
[38:04] unconditional promise amen god had made
[38:07] conditional promises to abraham he broke
[38:09] it to noah broke it amen promises were
[38:12] broke we're broke we're broke so god
[38:14] says i will make you the a great nation
[38:16] i all the families of the world will be
[38:18] blessed in thee he never said if you do
[38:20] i will he said i'm going to do this
[38:22] you're the one and this is what i will
[38:24] do and from that point on god was with
[38:27] abraham making sure that what god
[38:29] promised god was going to do
[38:33] and as abraham worked through this life
[38:35] and through these circumstances and
[38:37] situations kept changing abraham kept
[38:40] releasing more amen to the promise more
[38:44] to the word of god and less to his own
[38:46] thinking
[38:49] amen
[38:52] let's keep going
[38:53] now he says
[38:56] i want to catch this in verse 4.
[38:58] so abram departed
[39:00] that's what god told him to do
[39:02] so abram departed as the lord had spoken
[39:05] unto him and lot went with him
[39:08] that was what was not supposed to happen
[39:12] he told him to separate from his kindred
[39:14] and his father's house and so now he
[39:17] goes and lot went with him
[39:21] and you can imagine abra abram he says
[39:24] i'm doing what god told me to do now now
[39:26] listen this is so easy for us to do
[39:31] i'm doing what god said i'm going to a
[39:33] strange land i'm leaving mine going to a
[39:35] strange land
[39:37] and lot decided to come along
[39:41] but it wasn't full obedience to the word
[39:43] of god
[39:46] brother man told us it wasn't full
[39:48] obedience to the word of god
[39:50] so he goes
[39:52] and brother banham says this and jehovah
[39:54] jireh from 1958
[39:56] said i want you to notice abraham coming
[39:58] down
[39:59] out of babylon with his father and dwelt
[40:01] in the land of shinar and perhaps had
[40:04] his living there his wife was sarah his
[40:06] half-sister
[40:07] now he was 75 years old and sarah was 65
[40:10] years old before god ever spoke to him
[40:12] and made the covenant with him 65 year
[40:14] old woman 75 year old man and god said
[40:17] walk before me and be perfect
[40:19] god made the covenant with abraham
[40:21] unconditionally
[40:22] wasn't any conditions if you do this
[40:25] i'll do he made a covenant with a man
[40:27] once like that adam and he broke him
[40:30] man breaks his promise god can't break
[40:32] his promise
[40:34] god determined to save man he made the
[40:36] covenant to abraham unconditionally told
[40:39] him i've done this and it's going to be
[40:41] this way this is going to be and you're
[40:43] coming to me
[40:44] at an old age
[40:46] so god gives the promise
[40:49] god's going to keep the promise
[40:51] abraham's the one nobody else will
[40:53] become the one
[40:54] so god has got to get abraham in the
[40:57] condition
[40:58] listen there's nobody else
[41:01] there's there's nobody else that's going
[41:03] to fulfill this promise but us there's
[41:06] going to be a change in the body and the
[41:08] completion of a rapture that's going to
[41:09] take place there's going to be people
[41:11] who change from distant to that
[41:13] dimension and have their atoms change in
[41:14] their body who else is going to do that
[41:16] who will we leave it to god has called
[41:18] us then if god has called us and that's
[41:21] the promise for this hour and that's why
[41:23] the seals were open and that's why this
[41:25] thunder sounded to give us rapturing
[41:26] faith amen then who else will do it
[41:29] we'll do it how are we going to do it we
[41:31] can't do amen he has to do it through us
[41:35] and everything that's standing in the
[41:37] way of that fulfillment one by one god
[41:39] works us through and brings us through
[41:41] and moves it out of the way what's he
[41:43] doing increasing our faith really it's
[41:45] not increasing our faith he's decreasing
[41:48] ourself
[41:51] we are decreasing so that that faith
[41:54] he's already placed in us is increasing
[41:57] so that life of himself that's already
[41:59] there will have greater expression
[42:03] so i believe abraham was learning not to
[42:05] trust himself
[42:08] i think abraham was learning not to have
[42:09] confidence in himself
[42:12] so we know abraham leaves he travels
[42:15] over to the land that god told him and
[42:17] he gets in the land he's still not in
[42:20] full obedience because lot has come with
[42:23] him and now lots of tag along and he's
[42:25] brought lot into the promised land with
[42:27] him he's still not in full obedience but
[42:30] look what happens here in verse six
[42:32] chapter 12 verse six
[42:35] and abram passed through the land unto
[42:37] the place of cesium unto the plain of
[42:40] mora and the canaanite was then in the
[42:42] land and the lord appeared unto abram
[42:45] and said un unto thy seed will i give
[42:48] this land and there builded he an altar
[42:51] unto the lord who appeared unto him
[42:54] now as abraham was beginning in his
[42:57] journey
[42:58] he believes god does anybody doubt
[43:01] abraham believes god
[43:02] abraham is not an unbeliever abraham is
[43:05] a believer but he's not in full
[43:07] obedience he's in partial obedience
[43:10] because lot comes with him but as soon
[43:12] as even impartial obedience he makes a
[43:14] step towards god god appears to him
[43:17] anyways
[43:18] and confirms the promise
[43:21] i want to ask you have you always been
[43:24] in full obedience to this word
[43:27] and when you realize looking back i was
[43:29] not always was god still dealing with
[43:32] you or did he quit dealing with you
[43:34] did god still come and inject himself
[43:37] supernaturally in his life did he still
[43:38] speak to you did he still did he still
[43:40] make a way for you did he still heal you
[43:42] did he still deliver you did he still
[43:43] come and appear himself before you amen
[43:45] did he still open the word to you you
[43:47] look back and say i was in partial
[43:49] obedience but he was still there because
[43:51] you were making steps in the right
[43:52] direction and he as a father was guiding
[43:54] you along
[43:58] amen
[43:59] god understands us god understands where
[44:01] we are god's made a promise and he will
[44:03] get to that promise and nothing will
[44:05] stop him from getting to that promise
[44:07] and god is not just going to sit back
[44:09] and say hey buddy you're on your own
[44:11] amen we every every listen every time
[44:14] abraham made a step towards god in the
[44:16] promise god showed up and talked to him
[44:18] god dealt with him god delivered him god
[44:20] brought him further along in the journey
[44:22] amen because god said this is the one
[44:25] this is the promise it will happen
[44:28] and for us god says you're the one this
[44:31] is the promise it will happen
[44:34] when we were when we were in our walk
[44:36] and in our immaturity and in the and
[44:38] then the stages that we went through god
[44:40] was working with us all along
[44:42] bringing us from one situation to the
[44:44] next situation delivering from one
[44:46] obstacle and another obstacle and
[44:48] opening more to us along the way and
[44:50] what has been happening amen our faith
[44:53] has been increasing amen our confidence
[44:55] in god has been growing our
[44:56] understanding of who we are our
[44:58] understanding of the promise it's been
[45:00] growing all along
[45:04] amen
[45:06] brother branham says in the message of
[45:07] grace
[45:10] we'll call another character where god's
[45:12] grace was extended many of them we'll
[45:14] just speak of a few abram abraham
[45:17] abraham no special man came down from
[45:19] the tower of babel perhaps come out of
[45:21] an idolater bunch his father
[45:24] come down in the land of shinar down
[45:26] there to dwell in the city of ur and
[45:28] while he was there god spoke to him by
[45:30] grace not because he was different not
[45:32] because he was a better man but by grace
[45:34] god called him the bible clearly makes
[45:36] that known
[45:37] oh abraham how abraham tested god's
[45:41] patience
[45:43] i love that statement amen that
[45:45] statement is really for us to get
[45:46] understanding i don't know that god's
[45:48] patience can be tested i'm not sure
[45:51] but he said oh abram how abraham tested
[45:55] god's patience told him said abraham
[45:57] stay in this land don't you go out of it
[45:59] but as soon as famine come abraham run
[46:02] so so brother branham describes it to us
[46:05] like this god called abraham nobody else
[46:07] was going to be called god's watching
[46:09] over amen but abraham sometimes amen
[46:12] brother ben says he tested god's
[46:14] patience
[46:16] oh friends look back on your life
[46:18] do you ever look back and say oh
[46:22] is there any place you look back in your
[46:24] life as you walk as a believer and say
[46:27] oh god i'm sorry
[46:31] amen if abraham tested god's patience
[46:32] what about you and i
[46:35] but we found out there's no limit to
[46:37] god's patience
[46:39] there's no end to his mercy there's no
[46:41] cutting off of his grace
[46:44] amen when he's dealing with his children
[46:46] let's go to genesis 12 and 10 and look
[46:49] at this that the brother bam talks about
[46:51] genesis 12 and 10 and there was a famine
[46:54] in the land and abram went down into
[46:56] egypt to sojourn there for the famine
[46:58] was grievous
[47:00] in the land
[47:03] and it came to pass when he was near
[47:05] come near into the egypt that he said
[47:07] unto sarah his wife behold now i know
[47:09] that thou art a fair woman to look upon
[47:11] therefore it shall come to pass when the
[47:13] egyptians shall see thee that they shall
[47:15] say this is his wife and they will kill
[47:17] me but they will save thee alive
[47:21] i want to take a look at this and focus
[47:23] our attention on this scripture and look
[47:26] at this stage in abraham's journey this
[47:28] stage in abraham's journey abraham is
[47:31] still trying to save himself
[47:36] abraham is trying to save his life
[47:37] because of his wife and he's trying to
[47:39] save his life because of famine
[47:42] god told him brother baby tells us over
[47:44] and over god told him to go to this land
[47:46] and stay in this land he wasn't supposed
[47:48] to leave the land amen but when hardship
[47:51] come when a trial came abraham didn't
[47:54] stick with what god said abraham used
[47:56] his own reasoning and with unknown
[47:58] reasoning he said if we stay here we'll
[48:00] starve and he runs down to egypt because
[48:03] egypt has bread so
[48:06] abraham is trying to save his own life i
[48:10] say this self-preservation is a sign of
[48:13] immature faith
[48:16] you say what else would a man do i don't
[48:19] know what else would a man would do but
[48:20] just stay with god's word and say god
[48:22] you told me to stay in this land there's
[48:23] nothing here you have to provide and god
[48:26] proved that he could because
[48:28] the next generation when isaac comes on
[48:30] the scene isaac goes down to gerrard
[48:32] right on the border of egypt and he's
[48:34] about to cross into egypt for the same
[48:36] reason because there's a famine and god
[48:38] tells isaac he says do not go down into
[48:41] egypt
[48:43] because there was a famine
[48:45] and it's the same passage where he says
[48:47] he planted amen in the time of famine he
[48:51] planted in this famine season and god
[48:53] gave him a bountiful harvest of a
[48:55] hundred times more
[48:57] so god proved in the next generation
[48:59] down what he could do if somebody would
[49:02] stay where god said stay and do what god
[49:04] said do amen you don't need reasoning
[49:06] you need the word of god we don't need
[49:08] logic we don't need self-preservation we
[49:11] need to we need to sacrifice ourselves
[49:13] completely and let the word take
[49:15] dominion
[49:16] abraham and his walk was still
[49:18] preserving himself amen we're going to
[49:20] stay here we're going to die god said
[49:22] isaac you stay here and don't leave
[49:24] isaac planted and he reaped 100 or a
[49:27] bountiful 100 times more
[49:30] everybody else was hungry isaac had more
[49:32] than enough
[49:33] why did isaac have more than enough
[49:35] because he's a better farmer obviously
[49:36] he knows how to put the seed in he he's
[49:38] got irrigation he's a better he he did
[49:41] better because he obeyed god god said
[49:43] don't go he stayed
[49:47] so god's proving what can be done
[49:50] if we stay with his word
[49:53] they say
[49:54] how do you blame him as a man i don't
[49:56] blame him
[49:58] amen
[49:59] as a man who uses reasoning and logic
[50:02] and that's the reasonable logical thing
[50:03] to do obviously if his wife's very fair
[50:06] he knows how things work in that day
[50:08] amen they'll kill me to take her so
[50:11] logically he comes up with a plan to
[50:12] protect himself
[50:15] right
[50:16] but god comes down on the scene and
[50:17] shows that i can protect everybody
[50:20] because when pharaoh is going to take
[50:21] sarah and then he comes down and
[50:23] protects sarah and protects that womb
[50:24] because that's part of the promise
[50:28] see friends what abraham was learning
[50:31] was to take god out his word
[50:33] and not add any thinking to it
[50:36] just to take god at his word
[50:39] let's go over here to chapter 13.
[50:41] i'm just going to take it in order we're
[50:43] just going to march along in order
[50:48] chapter 13 verse 5 and lot also which
[50:50] went with abram had flocks had herds had
[50:53] tents and the land was not able to bear
[50:56] them that they might dwell together for
[50:58] their substance was great so that they
[50:59] could not dwell together
[51:01] and there was a strife between the
[51:03] herdmen of abram's cattle and the
[51:05] herdman of lot's cattle and the
[51:06] canaanite and the in the perizzite
[51:09] dwelled in in the land and abram saith
[51:12] unto lot let there be no strife i pray
[51:14] thee between me and thee in between my
[51:16] herdman and thy herdmen for we be
[51:18] brethren
[51:19] i want to stop right there for a minute
[51:22] god is in every detail
[51:25] when abram when abram went down into
[51:27] egypt and he had this thing he left the
[51:29] land he wasn't supposed to leave the
[51:30] land amen god preserved him he wasn't
[51:32] supposed to do all that but because of
[51:34] the situation amen pharaoh greatly
[51:37] increased the riches of abraham so that
[51:40] when they come out of egypt now abraham
[51:43] is rich
[51:45] you say man god is good even in his
[51:48] mistake he makes him rich and i say yeah
[51:50] it's good to be a son of god
[51:54] but why did god give him all of these
[51:55] riches amen in the next verse he and lot
[51:59] now have so much they can't live
[52:01] together anymore
[52:03] why is it that they can't live together
[52:05] anymore because god said separate from
[52:07] your kindred so god is going to work a
[52:09] circumstance that's going to cause
[52:11] separation how did god work the
[52:12] circumstance to bring separation he
[52:14] blessed them so abundantly that they
[52:16] could no longer live together
[52:19] god is watching over his word god is
[52:21] watching over his child
[52:24] so let's separate he says
[52:26] verse 9 is not the whole land before
[52:28] thee separate thyself i pray thee for me
[52:31] if thou wilt take the left hand then i
[52:33] will go to the right if thou depart to
[52:35] the right hand then i will go to the
[52:37] left and lot lifted up his eyes and
[52:39] behold all the plane of jordan and it
[52:41] was well watered everywhere before the
[52:43] lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh even as
[52:46] the garden of god liked the land of
[52:47] egypt as thou comest out of zoar
[52:51] then lot chose him all the plain of
[52:53] jordan lot journeyed east and they
[52:55] separated themselves the one from the
[52:57] other
[52:58] abram dwelt in the land of canaan and
[53:00] lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and
[53:02] pitched his tent towards sodom
[53:05] but the men of sodom were wicked sinners
[53:07] before the lord exceedingly
[53:09] and the lord said unto abram after that
[53:12] lot was separated
[53:15] catch this
[53:16] god's going to come and speak to abraham
[53:19] after lot separated how did god get lost
[53:23] separated god worked the plan god worked
[53:26] the circumstances to do what abraham
[53:28] wasn't able to do of his own self-will
[53:32] god created a circumstance to help the
[53:34] situation along and when they finally
[53:36] separated from one another god comes to
[53:39] speak to abraham again and the lord said
[53:41] unto abram after that lot was separated
[53:44] from him lift up now thine eyes and look
[53:47] from the place where thou art northward
[53:49] southward eastward and westward for all
[53:52] the land which thou seest to thee will i
[53:54] give him and to thy seed forever and i
[53:57] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[53:59] earth so that a man can number the dust
[54:02] of the earth then shall thy seed also be
[54:04] numbered
[54:05] arise walk through the land and the
[54:07] length of it in the breath of it for i
[54:10] will give it unto thee then abram
[54:12] removed his tent and came and dwelt in
[54:14] the plain of mamrie which is in hebron
[54:16] and built there an altar unto the lord
[54:19] i say praise god the grace of god amen
[54:22] abram he he knew the word of god amen
[54:25] but god amen first he allows terror to
[54:28] die to keep the word this is not
[54:29] abraham's great faith in action moving
[54:32] things it's god moving according to his
[54:34] word
[54:36] then he brings a lot along and they get
[54:38] into these situations but god brings
[54:40] brings something along that'll help
[54:42] abraham to do what abraham hasn't yet
[54:44] done of his own accord and it brings a
[54:46] separation but as soon as there's a
[54:48] separation god's not coming down in
[54:51] great wrath and punishment upon abraham
[54:53] he appears to abraham to once again
[54:55] confirm the promise to him
[54:57] see for god amen god is keeping his word
[55:00] for god it's about the promise
[55:03] god is keeping his
[55:04] word let's keep our place here in
[55:07] genesis keep your hand in genesis but
[55:08] turn with me to hebrews
[55:11] hebrews chapter 11
[55:16] so far we are reading
[55:18] about abraham moving in god's calling in
[55:21] god's commission
[55:24] and we know what brother branham said
[55:26] that god could never really bless
[55:27] abraham until he completely separated
[55:30] but we see how that complete separation
[55:32] came
[55:33] not by the will of abraham but by the
[55:36] mercies of god
[55:39] but let's look in hebrews
[55:42] chapter 11
[55:44] verse 8.
[55:45] by faith abraham when he was called to
[55:47] go out into a place which he should have
[55:49] to receive for an inheritance obeyed and
[55:51] he went out not knowing whether he went
[55:54] by faith he suddened in a strange land
[55:56] of promise as in a strange country
[55:58] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[56:00] jacob the heirs with him of the same
[56:02] promise for he looked for a city
[56:05] which has foundations
[56:07] whose builder and maker is god
[56:12] i'm so thankful
[56:14] for the account in hebrews
[56:17] because the account in hebrews to me is
[56:20] the heavenly account
[56:23] when you just read hebrews and you don't
[56:24] read genesis you're like abraham was a
[56:27] great
[56:29] by faith he left his land by faith he
[56:32] did this by faith and he was looking for
[56:34] a city all of those things are 100
[56:36] percent true by faith he left his home
[56:39] by faith he's sojourn in a strange land
[56:41] by faith amen but the bible's not
[56:44] listing that he didn't fully obey
[56:46] because he took lot along he didn't
[56:47] fully obey because of his father he
[56:49] didn't he didn't fully obey because he
[56:51] left the land it's only looking at what
[56:53] abraham believed and abraham believed
[56:55] the promise even if his actions were
[56:57] missteps
[56:58] even if for a little bit he stepped to
[57:00] the right god will bring him back he
[57:02] stepped to the left god will bring him
[57:03] back but the heavenly record only looks
[57:05] at what abraham believed and all along
[57:08] abraham believed the word of god
[57:10] he believed what god said he believed
[57:12] the promise of god he did obey he did
[57:15] walk amen when where he was lacking god
[57:18] was working out the details
[57:21] i hope that there's just a heavenly
[57:22] account of my life and says he believed
[57:24] the message of the hour he stood fast
[57:26] with the word of god he believed what
[57:29] the prophet said amen because i can look
[57:31] back on my life and say i believe but i
[57:33] still did that i believed but i allowed
[57:35] that compromise i believe but i still
[57:37] went along with this even though i knew
[57:38] it wasn't right amen i want all those
[57:40] things erased from my records i want a
[57:42] hebrew account of my life amen that says
[57:45] he believed the message when he heard it
[57:47] he believed it
[57:49] he walked out of his denomination and he
[57:51] walked into the promise of god and he
[57:53] believed the message and left us home
[57:55] and left all of this and left
[57:56] relationships
[57:59] that's the heavenly account
[58:02] the reality was i prayed tears full in
[58:04] my pillow saying god please don't let me
[58:06] be rejected by my family
[58:09] god if i could stay here and win them
[58:11] over god if i could just stay in the
[58:13] church and change the church
[58:18] the earthly account and the heavenly
[58:20] account are looking at two different
[58:22] pictures
[58:24] the earthly account is looking at my
[58:26] actions
[58:28] the heavenly accounts looking at my
[58:29] faith
[58:33] because there was something in me to
[58:34] believe the word but i needed child
[58:36] training to be able to stand on that
[58:38] word
[58:40] and god
[58:42] god brought separations in my life
[58:46] it wasn't me standing up at a family
[58:48] reunion
[58:51] god has called me into the message of
[58:52] the hour
[58:54] i'm leaving you behind like
[59:00] it was
[59:01] a human being
[59:03] scared and trembling and not not knowing
[59:06] how to handle all the situations that
[59:08] were around me
[59:12] but god was looking at a faith seat in
[59:13] there and a promise that he had and a
[59:15] plan he had before the foundation of the
[59:17] world and god said i'll take care of all
[59:19] these situations
[59:21] i'll bring conflict and separation and
[59:23] i'll bring this and i'll bring that and
[59:24] i'll get them into the right place
[59:28] oh i love the life of abraham because i
[59:30] look back and say the same god that led
[59:32] abraham as the same god who's led me
[59:35] the same god who took care of abraham's
[59:37] deficiency is the same god who took care
[59:39] of my deficiencies
[59:41] the same one who corrected abraham's
[59:42] misstep is the same one is correct in my
[59:44] misstep amen i'm following in the path
[59:46] of abraham my father in faith
[59:51] hebrew says
[59:53] abraham believed
[59:55] by faith he left us on absolutely that's
[59:58] nothing but the truth abraham always
[1:00:00] believed it
[1:00:02] but he just didn't always have all the
[1:00:04] actions right
[1:00:05] but he always believed it
[1:00:08] in the message forsaking all from 1962
[1:00:10] he said and god never did blase abraham
[1:00:12] until he totally obeyed him abraham
[1:00:15] wanted to take his daddy along and the
[1:00:16] old man was a fly in the ointment
[1:00:19] all the time finally he died then lot
[1:00:21] there was strife and everything and then
[1:00:23] as soon as abraham fully obeyed
[1:00:25] god and separated himself and let lot go
[1:00:28] on down there in the good lands wherever
[1:00:30] he wanted to go down in sodom then god
[1:00:32] appeared to abraham and said lift up
[1:00:34] your eyes i give the whole thing to you
[1:00:37] abraham was the one who separated he was
[1:00:39] the one who separated all to follow to
[1:00:41] follow god and he is the father of faith
[1:00:44] he is the one that we believe to be the
[1:00:45] faithful one the promise was made to
[1:00:48] abraham and his seed we being dead in
[1:00:50] christ or abraham's seed airs with him
[1:00:52] according to the promise
[1:00:54] if god could do what he did for abraham
[1:00:57] why can't we let god do it for us amen
[1:01:00] if if god could take care of all these
[1:01:02] situations for abraham to keep moving
[1:01:04] him in the promise why can't we let our
[1:01:06] past be god taking care of all these
[1:01:08] situations and move us into the promise
[1:01:10] instead of cringing over every mistake
[1:01:13] why can't we just thank god god thank
[1:01:15] you when i couldn't you could amen when
[1:01:17] i was failing you weren't failing when i
[1:01:19] had small vision you had big vision
[1:01:24] you know sometimes i i think this is
[1:01:27] just
[1:01:28] me pondering again
[1:01:30] that abraham wanted to take care of lot
[1:01:35] abraham's father took care of lot when
[1:01:37] lot's father died
[1:01:39] and now abraham's taking care of lot
[1:01:41] when when lot's grandpa dies
[1:01:45] and i think he wanted to take care of
[1:01:47] life i i don't know this for sure but
[1:01:50] this is just being a human being
[1:01:53] lots of family member whose father died
[1:01:55] grandfather died abraham really has been
[1:01:58] looking after him
[1:02:00] and no doubt abraham just wants to take
[1:02:02] care of him watch over him but god said
[1:02:04] separate from all
[1:02:06] so god even understands that part of
[1:02:09] abraham god even understands that desire
[1:02:12] in abraham and we see that desire never
[1:02:15] went away god brought the circumstances
[1:02:17] for separation when there was separation
[1:02:20] they separated god confirmed the promise
[1:02:22] but then lot down in sodom amen got in
[1:02:25] trouble
[1:02:27] brother branham said whenever you
[1:02:28] separate from the believers you get in
[1:02:30] trouble
[1:02:31] then the psalmist got in trouble and
[1:02:33] kings come in and took them away and who
[1:02:35] was fit to rescue the whole thing it was
[1:02:38] the one who was separated was fit to
[1:02:40] bring the rescue
[1:02:42] sometimes we think non-separation is how
[1:02:45] we take care of people not understanding
[1:02:47] that sometimes separation is the way we
[1:02:49] take care of people
[1:02:51] remember when god was going to go down
[1:02:53] and he was going to destroy sodom and he
[1:02:55] reveals it to abraham and abraham begins
[1:02:58] a series of intercession amen who is
[1:03:00] abraham worried about most down in sodom
[1:03:04] abraham is worried about lot down in
[1:03:06] sodom so he is interceding with god
[1:03:09] saying god would you surely the god of
[1:03:12] all the earth the righteous judge
[1:03:13] wouldn't destroy the righteous with the
[1:03:14] wicked what if you find 50 and he begins
[1:03:17] to what's he doing this shows that
[1:03:19] abraham still had a desire to take care
[1:03:21] of lot
[1:03:23] abraham didn't hate lot that wasn't what
[1:03:25] the separation was about abraham wasn't
[1:03:28] tired of lot that's not what the
[1:03:29] separation was about the separation was
[1:03:31] the separation for the word
[1:03:35] but because he was separated unto god
[1:03:38] he could intercede to god on behalf of
[1:03:41] lot who was stuck down in sodom
[1:03:46] sometimes we're afraid of separation and
[1:03:49] separation sometimes is the very thing
[1:03:50] that gives us intercession
[1:03:53] gives us an audience with god
[1:03:57] and god is mindful of these things
[1:04:01] god
[1:04:02] god didn't hate lot
[1:04:05] he didn't rip him away and destroy him
[1:04:07] god just brought a separation
[1:04:11] but abraham was still mindful of law
[1:04:13] when he got caught up and got carried
[1:04:15] away
[1:04:16] i mean i don't believe abraham got
[1:04:18] caught up in every battle and war that
[1:04:20] ever took place
[1:04:22] but this one involved his nephew
[1:04:24] and his nieces
[1:04:27] and he went and rescued them and brought
[1:04:28] them all back
[1:04:30] when he did that who did he meet on the
[1:04:32] way back but melchizedek the high priest
[1:04:34] of god
[1:04:36] why would god show up in such a tangible
[1:04:39] way amen to take care of abraham because
[1:04:42] this is just by the chat again i believe
[1:04:44] that what abraham did pleased god
[1:04:48] so we have to understand our separation
[1:04:50] not i hate these people they're bad
[1:04:52] influences on me i'm not gonna have
[1:04:53] anything to do with them i'm separating
[1:04:55] to the word and i stay separated by the
[1:04:57] word but my heart is still there god can
[1:04:59] you help them god can you deliver them
[1:05:01] hey don't be afraid to go pray for
[1:05:03] somebody in the hospital when they're
[1:05:04] sick they don't have to be a believer
[1:05:07] you can go fight the army of cheddar
[1:05:09] lamour and you can go into the hospital
[1:05:11] and lay hands on somebody if they can
[1:05:13] believe you amen they can be healed
[1:05:16] don't be afraid to fight for those that
[1:05:18] we've even had to separate over the word
[1:05:24] we know mindful we know god is mindful
[1:05:27] of these things
[1:05:30] because god says
[1:05:34] god says
[1:05:36] when he delivers lot
[1:05:38] he said god remembered
[1:05:40] abraham
[1:05:42] and delivered lot
[1:05:46] you know
[1:05:47] the best thing that we can do
[1:05:50] for our family who don't believers the
[1:05:52] best thing we can do for others
[1:05:55] is to give ourselves completely to the
[1:05:56] word of god and obey everything he says
[1:06:00] that's what when
[1:06:02] when abraham and lot separated abraham
[1:06:05] was still looking out for lot and
[1:06:07] abraham was still interceding for lot
[1:06:10] and god was mindful of them
[1:06:18] let's go to genesis chapter 15.
[1:06:23] after the battle after he delivers back
[1:06:26] lot and all of sodom
[1:06:29] he meets melchizedek melchizedek serves
[1:06:31] him communion he paid ties to
[1:06:33] melchizedek amen then sodom on the the
[1:06:37] king of sodom offers to let him keep all
[1:06:38] the spoils and he won't do it he says
[1:06:40] because i will not i've swore i've
[1:06:42] raised my hand to the god of heaven and
[1:06:44] i will not take anything unless you say
[1:06:46] you've made me rich
[1:06:48] and
[1:06:49] after that it says chapter 15 verse 1
[1:06:52] after these things the word of the lord
[1:06:53] came into abram in a vision saying fear
[1:06:56] not abram i am thy shield and my
[1:06:58] exceeding great reward
[1:07:00] and abram said why did god say that
[1:07:03] because abram wouldn't take any of the
[1:07:05] spoil and said god is the one who makes
[1:07:07] me wealthy not you
[1:07:09] i don't need anything you have all i
[1:07:11] need is god i want to ask you at this
[1:07:12] stage of the journey do you think
[1:07:14] abraham is starting to mature in his
[1:07:16] faith
[1:07:17] you think abraham's starting to realize
[1:07:19] some things amen i believe he's starting
[1:07:21] to realize some things he said i'm not
[1:07:23] taking anything unless you get credit
[1:07:24] for making me rich i swear to god i'm
[1:07:26] not going to take it off i'm trusting in
[1:07:28] god and god comes on and says i'm your
[1:07:31] shield and exceeding great reward
[1:07:34] and abraham said lord god what will thou
[1:07:36] give me seeing i go childless and the
[1:07:38] steward of my house is this eleazer of
[1:07:40] damascus and abram said behold to me
[1:07:43] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[1:07:46] in my house is mine heir and behold the
[1:07:48] word of the lord came unto him saying
[1:07:50] this shall not be thine air but he that
[1:07:53] shall come forth out of thine own bowels
[1:07:55] shall be thy heir
[1:07:57] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[1:07:59] look now toward the heaven and tell the
[1:08:00] stars if thou be able to number them and
[1:08:03] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[1:08:06] and he believed in the lord and he
[1:08:09] counted it to him
[1:08:10] for righteousness
[1:08:12] i'd like to continue saying whenever god
[1:08:14] spoke to abraham abraham believed it
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:20] now god says and
[1:08:22] as abraham journeys along god is
[1:08:25] constantly giving him more insight into
[1:08:28] the promise
[1:08:29] he's bringing more information along at
[1:08:32] first he says amen thy seed shall
[1:08:34] possess the land so now abraham knows
[1:08:36] he's going to have a seed he said in you
[1:08:38] shall all the nations be blessed so he
[1:08:40] knows he's going to have a seed amen but
[1:08:43] then now god comes along and says out of
[1:08:46] your bowels shall come a seed
[1:08:48] so now god as moses or as abraham
[1:08:52] journeys along god is giving him more
[1:08:54] insight into the promise more revelation
[1:08:58] about what he's promised him
[1:09:00] can you see yourself in this journey
[1:09:04] so now he knows and the scripture says
[1:09:07] this i want you to catch this
[1:09:10] and he believed the lord in the lord and
[1:09:13] he counted to him for righteousness
[1:09:16] he believed what god said and god
[1:09:18] counted them for righteousness
[1:09:21] so what does he do next chapter 16.
[1:09:25] now sarah abram's wife bare him no
[1:09:28] children
[1:09:29] and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose
[1:09:31] name was hagar
[1:09:33] and sarah i said unto abram behold now
[1:09:35] the lord hath restrained me from bearing
[1:09:37] i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be
[1:09:40] that i may obtain children by her and
[1:09:42] abram hearken to the voice of sarai and
[1:09:45] sarah abram's wife took hagar her maid
[1:09:48] the egyptian after abram had dwelt 10
[1:09:50] years in the land of canaan and gave her
[1:09:53] to her husband abram to be his wife
[1:09:56] so now
[1:09:57] we know
[1:09:58] that that this is the birth of ishmael
[1:10:00] this is how ishmael comes about
[1:10:02] but but abram already says he believed
[1:10:05] god
[1:10:07] god says no out of your bowel shall come
[1:10:09] a seed not not this eleazar damascus not
[1:10:12] your servant not one born in your house
[1:10:14] but one that comes out of your bowels
[1:10:16] and he believed god and god counted to
[1:10:19] him for righteousness but now he comes
[1:10:21] to sarah and sarah is now stuck in
[1:10:24] reasoning and the reasoning is god it's
[1:10:27] obvious i'm not going to have a baby
[1:10:28] look at me look how old i'm at god
[1:10:30] hasn't allowed it so now the next best
[1:10:33] thing that's legal and appropriate in
[1:10:35] our generation is to take my handmaid
[1:10:38] and raise up children unto me by that
[1:10:40] and abraham says okay that sounds
[1:10:43] reasonable
[1:10:45] and abraham going into hagar is never
[1:10:48] doubting or disbelieving god
[1:10:52] he believed god but he's using his own
[1:10:54] reasoning to bring about the promise
[1:10:57] they're using their own strengths
[1:10:58] they're using their own ideas to fulfill
[1:11:01] the word of god and god has to break
[1:11:03] abraham of this kind of thinking
[1:11:08] so god allows an ishmael to come on the
[1:11:10] scene
[1:11:14] let's go to chapter 17.
[1:11:19] when
[1:11:20] when ishmael comes on scene god doesn't
[1:11:22] strike abraham dead
[1:11:26] see in all of this walk
[1:11:29] abraham was believing god
[1:11:33] but he was believing god
[1:11:35] as a babe that was growing
[1:11:38] and god was working with abraham to grow
[1:11:40] him and to move him into position god
[1:11:43] didn't strike him dead every time he
[1:11:45] disobeyed
[1:11:46] when he went from ur to heron with his
[1:11:48] dad and lot and everything god didn't
[1:11:50] strike him dead god just made sure tyra
[1:11:52] passed off the scene
[1:11:55] so abraham said okay now it's time to go
[1:11:57] he goes but lot comes along god doesn't
[1:11:59] strike him down when he gets in the law
[1:12:00] into the land god shows himself to him
[1:12:02] and confirms the promise again
[1:12:04] what's he doing he's growing abraham
[1:12:06] he's molding abraham he's bringing
[1:12:08] abraham into the promise if god can do
[1:12:11] that for abraham can he do it for you
[1:12:12] and i friends
[1:12:14] can
[1:12:15] when we started on this journey we
[1:12:16] believed the word of god but we did a
[1:12:18] lot of immature things but we believe
[1:12:20] the word of god we believed he was our
[1:12:22] healer we believe the delivery we
[1:12:24] believe he sent malachi for amen to
[1:12:26] bring us out of denominationalism we
[1:12:28] believed amen that he was bringing us to
[1:12:30] a rapture we believed these things
[1:12:33] and we did a lot of immature things but
[1:12:35] he never threw us away because he
[1:12:36] couldn't throw away his own elect amen
[1:12:38] he couldn't change the promise he has to
[1:12:41] work with the elect and work in the
[1:12:43] promise and bring us into position to
[1:12:46] fulfill the word
[1:12:48] what has god been doing with us all
[1:12:49] these years he's been doing the same
[1:12:51] thing he didn't to abraham
[1:12:53] have any of you made a step to the right
[1:12:55] in egypt
[1:12:58] and god brought you back
[1:13:01] and maybe even had a reward afterwards
[1:13:04] still blessed
[1:13:07] have you ever made a step to the left
[1:13:10] and god brought you back yes
[1:13:17] god didn't choose you because of your
[1:13:19] actions
[1:13:21] he chose you because of predestination
[1:13:24] god will not throw you away because of
[1:13:26] your actions you may suffer from them
[1:13:28] but god will not throw you away
[1:13:30] because of predestination
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:35] it's not this is not legalism
[1:13:38] this is not good conduct then reward
[1:13:41] god is looking at who believes me and
[1:13:44] who believes my word
[1:13:46] god is the master of circumstances he
[1:13:49] can arrange things to where separation
[1:13:51] will come
[1:13:52] god can set up the circumstances where
[1:13:54] you'll make the right choice
[1:13:57] i don't know if you've ever been there
[1:13:58] i've been there before amen all of a
[1:14:01] sudden you've got 10 options and by the
[1:14:03] time it's done you only have one more
[1:14:05] option
[1:14:07] does that ever happen to you
[1:14:09] what was happening god's watching over
[1:14:11] his word god's bringing his promise to
[1:14:13] pass god will not lose one
[1:14:20] genesis 17
[1:14:21] 15
[1:14:26] and god said to abraham ask for sarah
[1:14:29] thy wife
[1:14:30] thou shalt not call her name sarai but
[1:14:32] sarah shall her name be and i will bless
[1:14:35] her and give thee a son also of her yea
[1:14:37] i will bless her and she shall be a
[1:14:39] mother of nations kings of people shall
[1:14:41] be of her then abraham fell upon his
[1:14:44] face and laughed and said in his heart
[1:14:46] shall a child be born unto him that is a
[1:14:48] hundred years old and sarah that is 90
[1:14:50] years old
[1:14:52] and abram said unto god oh that ishmael
[1:14:54] might live before thee
[1:14:57] and god said sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:14:59] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[1:15:01] his name isaac and i will establish my
[1:15:03] covenant with him for an everlasting
[1:15:06] covenant and with his seed after him
[1:15:09] god's going to bring the promise about
[1:15:11] anyhow
[1:15:13] amen and every stage of the journey god
[1:15:16] is giving abraham clearer understanding
[1:15:19] of the promise first you're going to be
[1:15:21] a mighty nation next the seed's going to
[1:15:24] come out of you well then we have ish we
[1:15:26] have ishmael no it's going to come
[1:15:28] through sarah at every stage of the
[1:15:30] journey god is bringing a little more
[1:15:32] revelation about he's not changing his
[1:15:35] word he's bringing a greater
[1:15:36] understanding of the original promise
[1:15:40] how many of you see the message the
[1:15:42] clearer than you saw it 40 years ago 20
[1:15:44] years ago 10 years he never changed the
[1:15:46] message he's given you clearer
[1:15:48] revelation of his message
[1:15:51] things that we thought we don't think
[1:15:52] those ways anymore what we thought was a
[1:15:54] right interpretation we've given those
[1:15:56] things up what we thought was right
[1:15:57] conduct we've turned from those things
[1:15:59] why because all along the journey god
[1:16:02] has guided us and turned us and every
[1:16:04] every step along the journey he's giving
[1:16:06] us more revelation on the original
[1:16:08] promise
[1:16:10] he's not changing the message he's
[1:16:11] opening more of it for us to see
[1:16:14] with abraham he wasn't changing the
[1:16:15] message he was opening more of the
[1:16:17] message for abraham to see
[1:16:20] and every time god opened more of the
[1:16:22] message abraham believed it
[1:16:24] lo and behold the faith that he had
[1:16:27] originally was the faith that he had all
[1:16:29] along the journey
[1:16:31] the faith the first believers call was
[1:16:33] the faith that he had that sarah was
[1:16:35] going to have a child
[1:16:37] is that right
[1:16:40] praise be to god
[1:16:42] so if abraham had the same faith to
[1:16:45] believe the promise originally the same
[1:16:47] faith debris believe that isaac will
[1:16:49] come through sarah what's changing
[1:16:53] abraham's changing
[1:16:56] you and i have the same faith that we
[1:16:58] had to believe this message originally
[1:17:01] that was the faith of god
[1:17:03] that was a seed of faith by grace we
[1:17:05] still have the same faith to believe the
[1:17:06] message the way we believe it now
[1:17:09] what's changed
[1:17:11] we've changed
[1:17:18] praise god
[1:17:25] amen let's look at
[1:17:26] no i don't want to look at this let's go
[1:17:28] somewhere else
[1:17:34] we know that later
[1:17:36] let's go to chapter 21.
[1:17:38] we'll look at chapter 21 verse 1.
[1:17:46] genesis 21 1 and the lord visited sarah
[1:17:49] as he had said and the lord did unto
[1:17:52] sarah as he had spoken for sarah
[1:17:55] conceived and bear abraham a son in his
[1:17:57] old age at the set time of which god had
[1:18:00] spoken to him
[1:18:02] and abraham called the name of his son
[1:18:04] that was born unto him whom sarah bore
[1:18:06] to him
[1:18:07] isaac
[1:18:09] listen god keeps his word
[1:18:13] abraham and sarah had no ability in
[1:18:16] themselves to bring about the promise of
[1:18:18] god
[1:18:20] the only thing they could do is believe
[1:18:22] god every time god revealed more of the
[1:18:23] word to them all they could do was
[1:18:25] believe it and accept it they had no
[1:18:27] power to do anything but when it was
[1:18:30] time for god to fulfill his promise god
[1:18:32] visited sarah according to his word
[1:18:34] according to the time of life and then
[1:18:37] sarah conceived and brought forth the
[1:18:39] son
[1:18:40] see there's promises in our lives but we
[1:18:42] have no power to produce them
[1:18:46] there's times that that we get stuck in
[1:18:49] a devil's trap of thinking things aren't
[1:18:52] happening in our lives because somehow
[1:18:54] there's something wrong with us
[1:18:57] we're wrong somewhere we have to do a
[1:18:59] better job we we're not committed enough
[1:19:02] i mean and i'll tell you the truth
[1:19:03] here's the truth if you want to know the
[1:19:05] real truth you're not committed enough
[1:19:09] i'm not committed and you know what else
[1:19:11] you're not sincere enough
[1:19:13] and you're not dedicated enough
[1:19:16] so when the devil brings that the
[1:19:18] there's no way that you're ever going to
[1:19:20] be committed enough to get god to do
[1:19:21] something for you are sincere
[1:19:24] and the prophet was told you must be
[1:19:25] more sincere that's true we must be more
[1:19:27] sincere but when you become more sincere
[1:19:30] you'll need to be more sincere yet
[1:19:34] do you need to do a better job you need
[1:19:36] to do a better job
[1:19:38] should you be more faithful you should
[1:19:40] be more faithful
[1:19:44] hey we agree when the devil comes and
[1:19:46] says you need to be more committed just
[1:19:47] say you're right
[1:19:49] i need to but that's not going to change
[1:19:50] the way god views me or my faith in god
[1:19:53] or god keeping his promise he he is not
[1:19:55] waiting on me amen to to do something in
[1:19:58] my own will and my own strength he's
[1:20:00] waiting for me to believe him and then
[1:20:02] follow through with what i see and walk
[1:20:05] and what he's led me to walk in i mean
[1:20:07] there's things that i don't see yet how
[1:20:09] will i see it until he opens it
[1:20:12] there are things we don't understand yet
[1:20:14] how are we going to understand it until
[1:20:16] god opened it takes divine revelation
[1:20:18] you don't get divine revelation by hours
[1:20:20] of reading
[1:20:23] but should you read
[1:20:24] you should read should you read more you
[1:20:26] should read more
[1:20:30] you don't read the message enough
[1:20:34] you don't listen to enough tapes
[1:20:38] see you can preach that in a way where
[1:20:40] everybody walks out of here feeling
[1:20:41] guilty that we haven't taken the rapture
[1:20:43] yet because i don't pray enough i don't
[1:20:45] read enough listen to enough tapes i
[1:20:46] don't read enough messages i'm not
[1:20:48] consecrated enough or sincere enough
[1:20:52] what could abraham do
[1:20:54] to produce a baby
[1:20:57] what could sarah do to produce a baby
[1:20:59] there's nothing they could do did
[1:21:01] abraham need to be more sincere yes
[1:21:05] did abraham need to be more obedient
[1:21:07] absolutely without question do you need
[1:21:10] to do more of the same yes
[1:21:14] but until god opens it until god changes
[1:21:17] it what are you gonna do this is not
[1:21:19] we're not playing a merit badge system
[1:21:22] with god amen you get so many points and
[1:21:24] then i'll release a promise to you
[1:21:28] if you come to church all the time don't
[1:21:29] miss communion pay all your tithes and
[1:21:31] you raise your children right i'm going
[1:21:32] to heal you
[1:21:34] if we had to live in that setup amen we
[1:21:37] would be the most discouraged people in
[1:21:39] the world but we live in a totally
[1:21:40] different kind of setup from god where
[1:21:42] god says i already have a plan for you i
[1:21:45] force saul i will bring it to pass amen
[1:21:47] all i'm asking you to do is surrender to
[1:21:49] me as i reveal myself to you
[1:21:52] believe me all these things are had by
[1:21:54] faith when god brings it believing
[1:21:58] abraham believed god at what point did
[1:22:01] abraham not believe god
[1:22:04] we would look back and see what abraham
[1:22:05] then said that's mistakes it is mistakes
[1:22:09] going to egypt mistake taking lot along
[1:22:11] mistake going to heroin with his dad
[1:22:13] mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake
[1:22:15] mistake
[1:22:18] what did it change
[1:22:20] did it change anything in the purpose of
[1:22:22] god or who he was or what god's plan was
[1:22:26] i'll ask you this did god work with all
[1:22:28] of his mistakes
[1:22:33] he allowed his mistake in egypt to
[1:22:35] foreshadow his seed coming down into
[1:22:37] egypt
[1:22:40] because when his seed goes down into
[1:22:41] egypt when when he when abraham goes
[1:22:43] into egypt he goes into egypt because
[1:22:45] what because there's a famine in the
[1:22:47] land
[1:22:49] when the children of israel come to
[1:22:50] egypt why did they come to egypt because
[1:22:52] there's a famine in the land
[1:22:57] when he goes to pharaoh when it's time
[1:23:00] for abraham to leave when god wants
[1:23:02] abraham to leave he lets plagues break
[1:23:04] out in pharaoh's house
[1:23:07] when it's time for the children of
[1:23:09] israel to leave he allows plagues to
[1:23:11] break out in pharaoh's house
[1:23:13] that's curious
[1:23:16] and when abraham leaves he leaves
[1:23:18] wealthy when the children of israel
[1:23:21] leave they leave wealthy
[1:23:24] is god you're saying god is even in his
[1:23:26] mistake
[1:23:28] and god is even using his mistake
[1:23:30] absolutely god is in every part of our
[1:23:33] lives god will allow you to stub your
[1:23:35] toes so that you know that it hurts to
[1:23:36] kick that rock
[1:23:40] i'm talking natural but it's spiritual
[1:23:41] too
[1:23:43] god will allow us to make spiritual
[1:23:44] mistakes to realize that his way is the
[1:23:46] only way his path is the only one that
[1:23:48] works
[1:23:51] amen god subjected us to this life amen
[1:23:54] we're in the world but not of the world
[1:23:56] but we suffer the same with the same
[1:23:58] things the world suffers with
[1:24:01] if not you wouldn't get cataracts need
[1:24:03] glasses have braces
[1:24:06] get a heart stint
[1:24:08] take an ibuprofen
[1:24:11] but we're here struggling with faith
[1:24:15] believing who we are and that god's got
[1:24:17] a plan in our lives
[1:24:18] and through it all he's healing
[1:24:20] delivering guiding he's doing something
[1:24:23] in my life
[1:24:25] i'm here for a purpose
[1:24:28] that's the difference
[1:24:30] we make mistakes can god work with your
[1:24:32] mistakes god can work with your mistakes
[1:24:35] i've said many many times abraham goes
[1:24:38] down to gerar
[1:24:39] after the body change
[1:24:42] you would think everything would be
[1:24:43] perfect you know
[1:24:44] but he goes to gerrard amen and still
[1:24:47] they keep this old lie that sarah is my
[1:24:49] sister and we know all that happens down
[1:24:51] there with the beam elect and he goes
[1:24:53] out of there amen and it's kind of a
[1:24:55] shameful thing it sounded disgraceful
[1:24:57] that abraham would do this twice
[1:25:00] but you know that is the only scripture
[1:25:02] in all the bible that a prophet can pick
[1:25:04] up four thousand years later and say see
[1:25:06] they received a body change at the
[1:25:08] visitation of god
[1:25:11] so can god even work with mistakes god
[1:25:13] can even work with mistakes
[1:25:16] the key is to have the faith of abraham
[1:25:18] and believe god's called me
[1:25:20] god will do what he said he will do
[1:25:25] do better okay i'll do better
[1:25:28] i want to do better
[1:25:30] is there anybody here who doesn't want
[1:25:31] to be more sincere
[1:25:33] raise your hand and then we'll have an
[1:25:34] altar call
[1:25:36] does anybody here not want to try hard
[1:25:38] anybody here not to want to be moral be
[1:25:40] we all want the same thing friends but
[1:25:42] it's going to take god guiding us
[1:25:44] there's still things we're blind to
[1:25:45] there's still things we're going in the
[1:25:47] wrong direction there's still things he
[1:25:48] needs to open to us but if we could look
[1:25:50] back at our life we could have absolute
[1:25:52] confidence the god who first called me
[1:25:54] and first brought the message to me has
[1:25:56] never forsaken me through all of my ups
[1:25:58] and downs all of my sidesteps he keeps
[1:26:01] moving me along and as he moves me along
[1:26:03] he does the same thing for me he did for
[1:26:04] abraham he keeps opening up more of his
[1:26:06] plan to me and i see it more clearly
[1:26:10] oh i will be a seed but it's not going
[1:26:12] to be my servant it'll come from me
[1:26:14] oh it'll come from me but it'll come
[1:26:15] through sarah every step he's learning
[1:26:17] more
[1:26:21] thanks be to god
[1:26:25] let's look
[1:26:26] at romans chapter 4.
[1:26:28] keep your place in genesis we're going
[1:26:30] to come back to that
[1:26:32] romans chapter 4.
[1:26:37] and verse 17.
[1:26:45] romans chapter 4 verse 17
[1:26:47] as it is written i have made thee a
[1:26:49] father of many nations
[1:26:51] before him whom he believed even god who
[1:26:54] quickened the dead and calleth those
[1:26:56] things which be not as though they were
[1:26:59] who against hope believed in hope that i
[1:27:02] might become the father of many nations
[1:27:04] according to that which was spoken so
[1:27:06] shall thy seed be so shall thy seed be
[1:27:09] and being not weak in faith he
[1:27:11] considered not his own body now dead
[1:27:13] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:27:15] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:27:17] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:27:19] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:27:21] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:27:24] persuaded that that what he had promised
[1:27:27] he was able also to perform and
[1:27:30] therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:27:33] righteousness
[1:27:35] thank god for the romans account
[1:27:38] and for the account in hebrews
[1:27:40] the romans account was he was not weak
[1:27:43] in faith well what was this deal with
[1:27:44] ishmael i don't know but he wasn't weak
[1:27:46] in faith
[1:27:49] what was his deal with lot i don't know
[1:27:51] but he wasn't weak in faith all along he
[1:27:53] was growing stronger in faith not
[1:27:55] growing weak in faith growing stronger
[1:27:57] in faith believing the promise more
[1:27:59] becoming more sure of god becoming more
[1:28:01] confident in god's plan and abraham is
[1:28:04] starting to give up his own ideas and
[1:28:06] just take god at his word
[1:28:09] brother branham said in the message have
[1:28:11] faith in god he said my subject is have
[1:28:13] faith in god now we are taught in god's
[1:28:16] blessed word that faith cometh by
[1:28:18] hearing and hearing by the word or the
[1:28:20] of the word now faith is also an
[1:28:23] experience and many times faith is had
[1:28:26] by a former experience makes faith grow
[1:28:29] faith being the substance of things
[1:28:31] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:28:32] seen so many people fail to find the
[1:28:35] real meaning of what faith is some
[1:28:37] people believe that faith is some
[1:28:39] sensation or some emotion but the bible
[1:28:42] said that faith is the substance of
[1:28:44] things hoped for
[1:28:46] but the man was telling us that many
[1:28:47] times
[1:28:49] faith he said many times faith is had by
[1:28:52] a former experience that makes faith
[1:28:54] grow
[1:28:56] why have we gone through all the things
[1:28:58] we've gone through so that we can learn
[1:29:00] to trust in faith
[1:29:02] and not in ourselves
[1:29:05] let's go to genesis 22
[1:29:08] and i want to look at abraham's great
[1:29:10] test
[1:29:12] this is a very very very familiar story
[1:29:15] but to me when i look at this test when
[1:29:18] he takes isaac or mount moriah i see a
[1:29:21] man who has come to perfect faith and
[1:29:23] confidence in the promise of god
[1:29:26] you look back on what abraham did and
[1:29:28] how abraham obeyed or partially obeyed
[1:29:31] or got in egypt got to goreer had
[1:29:34] ishmael you look at all of these things
[1:29:37] and you see a man who is believing god
[1:29:40] all the way but he's going to right to
[1:29:42] the left to the right to the left but
[1:29:44] god is bringing him through all of that
[1:29:46] and you come to genesis 22 and you find
[1:29:49] a man who's entered into a level of
[1:29:51] maturity that i say is a goal or a
[1:29:53] target for us
[1:29:55] this is in genesis
[1:29:57] 22 1
[1:29:59] and it came to pass after these things
[1:30:01] that god did tempt abraham and said unto
[1:30:04] him abraham and he said behold
[1:30:06] here i am
[1:30:08] let's go down to verse 4
[1:30:11] or no i'm sorry verse 1 again all right
[1:30:13] verse 2. sorry and he said take now thy
[1:30:15] son thine only son isaac who now loveth
[1:30:18] and get thee into the land of moriah and
[1:30:20] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:30:22] upon one of the mountains that i will
[1:30:24] tell thee of
[1:30:26] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:30:28] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:30:30] young men with him and isaac his son
[1:30:32] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[1:30:34] and rose up and went into the place of
[1:30:36] which god had told him
[1:30:39] now listen
[1:30:41] this makes no logical sense
[1:30:46] god had promised abraham his seed the
[1:30:49] promise at the beginning was attached to
[1:30:52] abraham's seed
[1:30:54] god kept confirming the promise of a
[1:30:56] seed in the land a seed and a land and
[1:30:59] he kept revealing that seed until
[1:31:01] finally give a revelation of sarah and
[1:31:03] isaac and isaac the promised seed and
[1:31:06] now god comes along to tempt or to test
[1:31:10] abraham in abraham's test he would take
[1:31:13] the very thing that abraham has believed
[1:31:15] in all along the very culmination of all
[1:31:18] of his faith and all of his experiences
[1:31:20] he would tell him to take that now take
[1:31:22] that thing that is the product of thy
[1:31:24] faith and the thing you've been pointed
[1:31:26] to all your life and slay it
[1:31:29] it makes zero logical sense
[1:31:33] but abraham has come to the place where
[1:31:35] he is not trusting in logical sense
[1:31:37] anymore he has learned to take god at
[1:31:40] his word
[1:31:42] this is not i'd say this is the same man
[1:31:45] but this is not the same man that went
[1:31:47] with his father to her on and took lot
[1:31:49] to the promised land
[1:31:51] this is not the same man that went to
[1:31:53] egypt this is not the same end that went
[1:31:54] to garage this is not the same man that
[1:31:56] took hagar and raised up ishmael he's
[1:31:58] the same but something has changed in
[1:32:01] abraham
[1:32:03] abraham has learned something
[1:32:05] in his journey
[1:32:09] look at verse 4.
[1:32:13] i don't want to go to verse 4 yet i want
[1:32:15] to look at abraham
[1:32:19] he now is asked to do something
[1:32:22] that he absolutely cannot explain
[1:32:26] i mean we thought it took faith before
[1:32:28] to live the life abraham lived this is
[1:32:30] going to take a whole other level of
[1:32:31] faith
[1:32:33] but abraham doesn't argue with god
[1:32:36] he doesn't ask for an alternative course
[1:32:38] of action is that abraham gets up
[1:32:41] saddles his ass takes the
[1:32:43] the two young servants takes isaac takes
[1:32:46] wood takes fire takes a knife and starts
[1:32:48] moving
[1:32:51] i say god bring us to this kind of faith
[1:32:56] verse 4 then on the third day abraham
[1:32:59] lifted up his eyes and saw the place of
[1:33:01] far off and abraham said unto his young
[1:33:03] men abide here with the ass and i and
[1:33:07] the lad will go yonder in worship and
[1:33:09] come again
[1:33:10] to you
[1:33:11] we've talked about this scripture so
[1:33:13] many times but this is a proclamation of
[1:33:16] abraham's faith in the promise of god
[1:33:18] because abraham is not disbelieving or
[1:33:21] doubting god one iota and neither is
[1:33:24] abraham reasoning in a way but abraham
[1:33:27] knows that god said in isaac shall thy
[1:33:31] seed be called that this is isaac it has
[1:33:34] to be isaac
[1:33:36] he's come to the place to have
[1:33:38] confidence in god's word and not to mix
[1:33:40] it with his own plan
[1:33:43] now he's not trying to find a way to
[1:33:44] save isaac he's not even intent on
[1:33:47] saving isaac we know because hebrews
[1:33:49] tells us that he was determined to slay
[1:33:51] isaac
[1:33:53] he is not coming up with an alternative
[1:33:55] plan he is taking god at his word so now
[1:33:58] he's got two words that look like they
[1:34:00] contra they're contradictory to one
[1:34:02] another slay thy son but in isaac shall
[1:34:04] thy seed be called so now he's going up
[1:34:07] to moriah to do what god told him to do
[1:34:10] to slay isaac amen but but when he goes
[1:34:13] to moriah and when he leaves the two
[1:34:15] young men he says you stay here the lad
[1:34:18] and i
[1:34:21] will go worship
[1:34:23] and come again to you
[1:34:27] who's going to go worship the lad and i
[1:34:29] who's going to come again the latter i
[1:34:32] hold your place here and turn to the
[1:34:34] book of hebrews hebrews chapter 11 verse
[1:34:36] 17.
[1:34:50] hebrews 11 17.
[1:34:54] by faith abram of abraham when he was
[1:34:57] tried offered up isaac
[1:34:59] and he that had received the promise
[1:35:01] offered up his only begotten son
[1:35:03] of whom it was said that in isaac shall
[1:35:05] thy seed be called
[1:35:07] accounting that god was able to raise
[1:35:09] him up even from the dead
[1:35:12] from whence also he received him and a
[1:35:15] figure
[1:35:17] abraham's mind was not on getting out of
[1:35:20] this
[1:35:22] abraham was not working an alternative
[1:35:24] plan
[1:35:25] abraham believed god's word so much that
[1:35:29] if god asked him to kill the very
[1:35:31] product of the promise he believed that
[1:35:33] god was able to raise him from the dead
[1:35:36] in the way that he had received him in a
[1:35:38] type
[1:35:40] abraham was so sure of god he wasn't now
[1:35:43] because god told him to go and offer
[1:35:45] isaac as an accurate sacrifice he wasn't
[1:35:47] then going well maybe isaac isn't the
[1:35:49] one maybe i misunderstood god no he
[1:35:52] heard god right he knew isaac was the
[1:35:54] one so hebrews tells us that what was
[1:35:56] going on in abraham's mind was that
[1:35:58] abraham said this is the one this is the
[1:36:00] word of god now abraham is not adding
[1:36:03] anything to the word of god he won't
[1:36:06] manhandle it anymore
[1:36:09] before he would manhandle it he would
[1:36:11] say now you go into the promised land
[1:36:13] and you stay in the land where i told
[1:36:14] you this is what brother bam tells us
[1:36:16] but he says but surely god won't let me
[1:36:18] stay here when there's a famine god
[1:36:19] would understand i got to go and eat
[1:36:22] that's manhandling the word
[1:36:26] he says out of your bowels shall come
[1:36:29] your seed and then sarah comes up with
[1:36:31] this plan you know hagar and it's legal
[1:36:33] and he said yeah i agree with you and it
[1:36:35] would still be coming out of my mouth
[1:36:37] that's still the word okay we'll go with
[1:36:38] this plan amen which was not the plan of
[1:36:41] god but he went with that plan anyway
[1:36:43] what was he doing he was adding his own
[1:36:46] interpretation to the word
[1:36:48] and it produced an ishmael
[1:36:51] but now we get to this time and this is
[1:36:53] the hardest test of all harder than
[1:36:56] leaving kenfo harder than leaving
[1:36:58] country harder amen than staying in a
[1:37:00] land that's under famine this is the
[1:37:02] hardest test of all but this is why
[1:37:04] abraham is the father of the faith
[1:37:06] because he's come to a perfect faith
[1:37:09] slay the very product of the promise
[1:37:12] if that's what you want that's what i'll
[1:37:14] do
[1:37:18] come on son let's go
[1:37:21] let's go
[1:37:24] what's he thinking
[1:37:26] i don't know exactly what he's thinking
[1:37:27] but hebrews tells us he had thoughts
[1:37:31] and he was thinking god's able to raise
[1:37:33] him back up
[1:37:35] so that means abraham was fully intent
[1:37:37] and obeying the word of god
[1:37:39] but he never doubted the original
[1:37:41] promise
[1:37:44] what an impossible situation
[1:37:46] intellectually
[1:37:50] god has got abraham to a point where
[1:37:52] abraham's just going to obey
[1:37:54] and not mix any reasoning
[1:37:57] into his obedience
[1:37:58] let's go back to genesis 22.
[1:38:05] 22-6
[1:38:09] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:38:11] offering and laid it upon isaac his son
[1:38:14] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:38:16] knife and they went both of them
[1:38:18] together and isaac spake unto abraham
[1:38:20] his father and said my father and he
[1:38:22] said here am i my son
[1:38:24] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:38:27] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:38:28] offering and abraham said my son god
[1:38:31] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:38:33] offering so they went both of them
[1:38:36] together
[1:38:37] amen i i believe it like this
[1:38:40] like brother
[1:38:42] marcus was saying about the
[1:38:43] manifestation of the third pool you'll
[1:38:45] say something and not even know what
[1:38:46] you're saying
[1:38:48] we know by hebrews this is not the plan
[1:38:50] abraham was thinking abraham was not
[1:38:53] thinking god will provide another lamb
[1:38:55] abraham was thinking god can raise him
[1:38:56] up but when a son asked him the question
[1:38:59] it wasn't abraham's thinking but
[1:39:01] something came out of abraham's mouth
[1:39:03] and what came out of abraham's mouth was
[1:39:04] the spoken word
[1:39:08] and in the walking in obedience walking
[1:39:10] in perfect obedience there was a need
[1:39:13] abraham had his own thought on how god
[1:39:15] will work the plan but he wasn't
[1:39:17] doubting the word but yet he had his own
[1:39:19] thought on how god will do this but as
[1:39:21] they're walking along
[1:39:22] isaac asks a question father the wood
[1:39:24] father the fire where is the lamb he
[1:39:26] said god will provide himself a lamb for
[1:39:28] a burnt offering
[1:39:29] and that is exactly what god did showing
[1:39:32] that abraham was speaking the word of
[1:39:34] god amen this was the third poll this
[1:39:36] was the spoken word
[1:39:39] when did it come
[1:39:40] it came when he was walking in obedience
[1:39:43] to god without questions
[1:39:47] and it wasn't abraham's thinking it just
[1:39:49] came out of abraham's mouth
[1:39:53] god will provide himself a burn offering
[1:39:57] verse 9 and they came to the place which
[1:39:59] god had told him of and abram built an
[1:40:02] altar there and laid the wooden order
[1:40:04] and bound isaac his son and laid him on
[1:40:06] the altar upon the wood
[1:40:08] and abram abraham stretched forth his
[1:40:10] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[1:40:12] and the angel of the lord called unto
[1:40:14] him out of heaven and said abram abraham
[1:40:17] and he said here am i
[1:40:19] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[1:40:21] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:40:24] for now i know that thou fierce god
[1:40:26] seeing that thou hast not withheld thy
[1:40:28] son thy only son from me and abraham
[1:40:32] lifted up his lifted up his eyes and
[1:40:34] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:40:37] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[1:40:39] abraham went and took the ram and
[1:40:41] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[1:40:43] the stead of his son
[1:40:45] and abraham called the name of the place
[1:40:47] jehovah jireh as it is said to this day
[1:40:50] in the mount of the lord
[1:40:52] it shall
[1:40:53] be seen
[1:40:56] god saw
[1:40:59] god knew the obedience of the man and
[1:41:01] god provided a plan
[1:41:03] abraham this time did not have to come
[1:41:05] up with his own plan
[1:41:07] abraham this time did not have to figure
[1:41:09] it out on his own he didn't compromise
[1:41:12] it he didn't sidestep it he didn't
[1:41:14] manhandle it he just obeyed it and god
[1:41:18] supernaturally provided what abraham
[1:41:20] needed so abraham could keep the word
[1:41:24] when abraham spoke brother branham said
[1:41:26] he said they were up there gathering
[1:41:28] stones for an altar they looked all over
[1:41:29] the place on that mountaintop there was
[1:41:31] no ram there
[1:41:33] he said god created a ram by abraham's
[1:41:37] spoken word
[1:41:39] why did god create a ram because god had
[1:41:41] already given a promise to abraham and
[1:41:43] god is not going to change the promise
[1:41:45] god is going to keep the promise he was
[1:41:47] just testing abraham and now he finally
[1:41:49] got abraham to the place that abraham
[1:41:51] was supposed to be but i tell you
[1:41:53] friends where abraham was is exactly
[1:41:55] where god foresaw him to be that's where
[1:41:58] god led him all along
[1:42:02] i believe with all my heart this bride
[1:42:04] is going to get to the same kind of
[1:42:06] faith
[1:42:08] where she doesn't question she doesn't
[1:42:10] reason she doesn't sidestep figure
[1:42:12] another plan leaving a time of famine
[1:42:14] take extras along she's just going to do
[1:42:17] exactly what he said and she's going to
[1:42:19] believe that somehow he'll work it out
[1:42:22] how's he going to work it out you know
[1:42:24] abraham had to give up so much to go to
[1:42:26] mount moriah he had to give up his
[1:42:28] emotions
[1:42:30] his thoughts his desires his sign his
[1:42:33] reputation amen brother bannon tells us
[1:42:35] all the time about mo about abraham
[1:42:37] telling everybody i'm going to have a
[1:42:38] son and they laughed at him and they
[1:42:40] mocked him hey father of nations where's
[1:42:42] your son at
[1:42:44] and now the fulfillment of the promise
[1:42:47] comes abraham is vindicated abraham is
[1:42:49] justified and god tells him to take that
[1:42:52] very thing and slay it
[1:42:55] he's giving up
[1:42:57] everything
[1:42:58] to keep the word of god
[1:43:01] and in the line of duty
[1:43:05] god provides this power of the spoken
[1:43:06] word
[1:43:08] and a supernatural ram to take his place
[1:43:14] we want to see supernatural things but
[1:43:16] we're still trying to go to egypt to get
[1:43:17] bread
[1:43:21] we want to see supernatural things but
[1:43:22] we're still coming up with hagar plans
[1:43:24] to bring about
[1:43:26] if we want to see god work
[1:43:27] supernaturally we've got to stick with
[1:43:28] god's word
[1:43:30] and let god be responsible for keeping
[1:43:32] his worth abraham now is not feeling
[1:43:34] responsible to bring the promise to pass
[1:43:37] abraham has passed all of that i said
[1:43:39] god help me get past all of that i don't
[1:43:41] want to have to feel responsible amen
[1:43:44] for healing somebody's body you're the
[1:43:46] only healer that there is
[1:43:48] i don't want to feel responsible amen
[1:43:50] for trying to make the promise work out
[1:43:51] and make things the way you said they
[1:43:53] would be i just want to trust in you and
[1:43:55] you work those out i want to get beyond
[1:43:57] those things and i want to come to the
[1:43:59] place where we don't have to take care
[1:44:01] of those things god will take care of
[1:44:02] him all i got to do is stand on his word
[1:44:04] and say god you said i don't know what
[1:44:06] else to do
[1:44:09] elijah he could do everything god told
[1:44:11] him to do on mount carmel i mean he
[1:44:13] could he could slay the animal he could
[1:44:15] put the word in order or the the wooden
[1:44:17] order he could slay the beast he could
[1:44:20] cover it all with water he could do
[1:44:21] everything like he saw the vision do but
[1:44:24] he could never make that fire come down
[1:44:26] from heaven that was up to god
[1:44:28] and all he could do was say god i've
[1:44:30] done this i've done all of this at thy
[1:44:32] bidding
[1:44:34] and then he had to wait moses when he
[1:44:36] took the rod amen god told him cast that
[1:44:39] rod down now take it up it became a
[1:44:41] serpent and then it became back to a
[1:44:42] stick he goes and cast it down and now
[1:44:45] janice and jamboree's they throw down
[1:44:46] their rods there's nothing else moses
[1:44:48] could do he couldn't pretend he couldn't
[1:44:50] come up with plan b he couldn't make
[1:44:52] excuses for them having snakes
[1:44:56] all he could do was brother bam said he
[1:44:58] did what god told him to do all he could
[1:45:00] do is stand by and wait for god
[1:45:04] and what god did is allowed his snake to
[1:45:06] swallow up the other two and he picked
[1:45:07] it up and he had his rod plus their rods
[1:45:11] abraham couldn't do that all abraham
[1:45:14] could do was keep the word listen
[1:45:16] there's a multitude of things that you
[1:45:18] and i can't do
[1:45:20] i mean we if we just sit down together
[1:45:22] and we started listening them
[1:45:24] heal your body
[1:45:26] save your children
[1:45:28] i mean what else do we want to list what
[1:45:30] is it we can't do but the one thing we
[1:45:32] can do is by his grace we can say amen
[1:45:34] to the word and say god line me to that
[1:45:36] word and i'm going to obey it amen not
[1:45:38] any extra thinking not any extra plan
[1:45:40] but i'll just take you at your word and
[1:45:42] if i take you at your word it's no
[1:45:44] longer my responsibility now it's your
[1:45:47] responsibility
[1:45:49] abraham is walking along
[1:45:52] with the promised son
[1:45:54] going to kill the promised son he's got
[1:45:57] a dilemma but he
[1:45:58] he's not going to worry about it he's
[1:45:59] just going to do it
[1:46:01] and his son asked him what about this
[1:46:03] land what about the sacrifice
[1:46:05] he said god will provide us
[1:46:09] a sacrifice
[1:46:11] no that's not what he said
[1:46:14] god will provide himself a sacrifice
[1:46:18] god's the one who gave the promise
[1:46:20] god's the one who has to keep the
[1:46:22] promise
[1:46:25] listen
[1:46:27] we didn't make up the message
[1:46:31] that was from the mind of god
[1:46:34] it is the word of god
[1:46:36] we don't have to keep it
[1:46:38] god will keep it we don't have to bring
[1:46:41] it to pass we have to believe it and
[1:46:43] walk in it and he'll keep it amen
[1:46:45] god will provide for himself everything
[1:46:48] that he needs to bring his purpose to
[1:46:50] pass it's not up to us it's up to us to
[1:46:53] receive it to believe it and to obey it
[1:46:56] it's up to god to take care of the rest
[1:47:00] and if you're having trouble obeying it
[1:47:01] he knows how to move you
[1:47:04] because he won't lose you
[1:47:06] now let's look at verse 15.
[1:47:10] and the angel of the lord called unto
[1:47:11] abraham out of heaven the second time
[1:47:14] and said by myself have i sworn saith
[1:47:16] the lord
[1:47:17] for because thou has done this thing and
[1:47:19] has not withheld thy son thine only son
[1:47:22] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:47:24] multiplying i will multiply thy seed is
[1:47:27] the stars of heaven and as the sand
[1:47:29] which is upon the seashore and thy seat
[1:47:31] shall possess the gate of his enemy and
[1:47:34] in thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:47:36] earth be blessed because thou has obeyed
[1:47:39] my voice
[1:47:42] listen
[1:47:43] god
[1:47:44] after abraham did
[1:47:46] this action this obedience on mount
[1:47:48] moriah god come down supernaturally and
[1:47:50] confirmed it again and said because you
[1:47:53] obeyed my voice i this i this i this and
[1:47:56] i this
[1:47:58] listen that was not a new covenant
[1:48:01] that was not a new promise god was
[1:48:03] reconfirming the old promise nothing
[1:48:05] changed in the mind of god god wasn't
[1:48:08] waiting for abraham to obey god was just
[1:48:10] god was blessing abraham for his
[1:48:12] obedience and said i swore of myself i
[1:48:15] will do this i will do this i will do
[1:48:17] this and i will do this god was so
[1:48:19] pleased with abraham he was once again
[1:48:21] confirming his promise
[1:48:23] but it wasn't a new promise it was the
[1:48:26] original promise
[1:48:31] brother branham says in the message
[1:48:33] expectation
[1:48:36] he said now we find out that the child
[1:48:37] never arrived until 25 years later but
[1:48:40] instead of growing weak because it never
[1:48:42] happened the first month he grew
[1:48:44] stronger all the time because his
[1:48:46] expectation was greater if sarah was one
[1:48:49] month older it'd be one month greater
[1:48:51] than the expectations because god kept
[1:48:52] his word
[1:48:53] it would be a lot better for her to have
[1:48:55] the child at 100 years old than it was
[1:48:57] at 60 years old see what i mean it was a
[1:48:59] greater miracle all the time
[1:49:02] and he never grew weak but he grew
[1:49:03] stronger all the time
[1:49:06] now we are the children of abraham the
[1:49:08] bible said so we being dead in christ
[1:49:11] take on abraham's seed and our heirs
[1:49:13] according to the promise we are heirs of
[1:49:16] the promise with abraham because abraham
[1:49:18] was given the promise now if we are his
[1:49:20] heirs with abraham then we are abraham's
[1:49:22] children and the same faith that abraham
[1:49:25] have
[1:49:26] we have ourselves
[1:49:29] that when god makes a promise just know
[1:49:31] it's going to happen
[1:49:33] it can't do anything else
[1:49:38] and the message possessing
[1:49:40] thy seed shall possess the gate of the
[1:49:42] enemy
[1:49:43] you go through a test god tests you like
[1:49:45] he did abraham he test abraham's seed
[1:49:49] after him and now the reason we don't
[1:49:51] possess the gate of the enemy the reason
[1:49:53] there's so much among us is because that
[1:49:55] we're not able to stand the test
[1:49:58] and let me tell you something the test
[1:50:00] of the word is right
[1:50:03] he goes on further in the same message
[1:50:04] he says now abraham the promise is made
[1:50:07] to abraham and to a seat after him now
[1:50:10] god give his promise to abraham of his
[1:50:12] seed would possess the gate of his enemy
[1:50:14] after he had tried abraham tested
[1:50:16] abraham
[1:50:17] now after the testing comes abraham had
[1:50:20] already been converted we would call it
[1:50:22] from paganism unto god and then god had
[1:50:25] given him a sign of the holy ghost the
[1:50:27] circumcision then after the circumcision
[1:50:30] then come the testing time
[1:50:33] listen if it happened to abraham it will
[1:50:34] happen to us
[1:50:36] god's going to test us
[1:50:39] what's he looking for
[1:50:40] he's looking for perfect faith
[1:50:43] he's looking for somebody that that has
[1:50:45] walked with god that god's led that
[1:50:48] god's establishing the truth that'll
[1:50:50] just say god you said it i don't know
[1:50:52] how you work it out but i'm trusting in
[1:50:54] you
[1:50:56] i
[1:50:57] we we come to this position where we
[1:50:59] were gonna
[1:51:00] have somebody in our family tested for
[1:51:02] covet and i i knew what that means i
[1:51:04] know if it's a positive test then
[1:51:06] there's quarantines and difficulties and
[1:51:08] difficulties for everybody else but i i
[1:51:11] finally got to the place where i said
[1:51:12] god it is what it is i'm in your hands
[1:51:16] you know i've got a trip coming up to
[1:51:18] uganda i want to make sure for the sake
[1:51:21] of brother abraham and his family that
[1:51:23] that we're there i want to do all that i
[1:51:25] can
[1:51:26] but at the end of the day it has to be
[1:51:28] god
[1:51:29] i can only do so much
[1:51:31] i want to be here faithful in my post of
[1:51:33] duty to preach when it's my time to
[1:51:34] preach and to do what god's called me to
[1:51:36] do but there's only so much i can do it
[1:51:39] already was what it was
[1:51:41] i could act like an ostrich and stick my
[1:51:43] head in the sand and say everything's
[1:51:44] fine but that's not really
[1:51:46] honest but i could commit myself to god
[1:51:49] and say god it is what it is
[1:51:51] and i'm trusting in you
[1:51:53] i want to stay in my post of duty i want
[1:51:55] to go to uganda i want to do what you've
[1:51:56] called me to do
[1:51:58] but god if you have another plan then
[1:52:00] it's up to you i can't change anything
[1:52:04] it is what it is
[1:52:06] and i tell your friends that's not the
[1:52:08] way i was five six seven eight years ago
[1:52:12] i would have tried to think well if i
[1:52:14] don't know i could answer this way
[1:52:21] and you were the same way
[1:52:23] [Laughter]
[1:52:25] we're in this boat together
[1:52:28] years ago i would have tried to say but
[1:52:30] for the ministry say and because of this
[1:52:33] and because of that i need to make sure
[1:52:35] this and i need and and it's better not
[1:52:37] to know listen i'm not going to go get a
[1:52:40] test every time i sneeze
[1:52:44] but if i've got a real concern
[1:52:47] if there's a real issue and god puts it
[1:52:48] on my heart then i need to be honest
[1:52:52] and responsible
[1:52:54] i told my wife there's six of us in the
[1:52:56] family if we stayed home every time
[1:52:57] somebody sneezed and coughed
[1:52:59] then forget see i'll see you guys in a
[1:53:01] couple of years i mean
[1:53:03] it's not going to happen
[1:53:05] that's not what i'm talking about but
[1:53:07] i'm talking about
[1:53:08] when you lose your sense of taste and
[1:53:10] you say i had a stupid covet i don't
[1:53:12] care god will take care of me
[1:53:16] i'm going to the fellowship anyways
[1:53:20] that's not faith friends
[1:53:22] that's not integrity that's not honesty
[1:53:27] that's just not right
[1:53:29] it's a bravado it's a brashness
[1:53:32] that has rooted more in fear than in
[1:53:34] faith
[1:53:35] more in pride than in faith
[1:53:38] but god allows these things we can't
[1:53:40] change them
[1:53:41] what can you do about it
[1:53:43] at some point you say god i'm in your
[1:53:45] hands
[1:53:46] if you allow it you allow it and i'll
[1:53:48] trust that it's right
[1:53:50] i can't see how it's right
[1:53:51] i feel like i'm supposed to do this i'm
[1:53:53] supposed to do this but it's up to you
[1:53:55] we you know for me
[1:53:57] i made that decision so easy
[1:54:00] how did i make that decision so easy
[1:54:02] because two years ago it was really hard
[1:54:04] decision to make
[1:54:08] think
[1:54:09] covets of the devil
[1:54:11] god allowed it
[1:54:14] there's things that he's working out of
[1:54:16] us
[1:54:17] and when this one's done another
[1:54:19] something will come
[1:54:20] may not be a sickness may not be this it
[1:54:23] may be something it may be a financial
[1:54:24] disaster it may it may be a natural
[1:54:27] disaster who knows what it'll be but god
[1:54:29] is perfecting the faith in his bride
[1:54:31] until she quits trying to take care of
[1:54:33] herself she quits playing games she
[1:54:35] quits going to egypt she quits taking a
[1:54:37] long lot she stops having hagar until
[1:54:40] she finally gets the place to say lord
[1:54:42] i'm standing here your god i'm here
[1:54:45] what you want
[1:54:47] is what i want
[1:54:49] what you allow
[1:54:50] i accept
[1:54:52] what you change only you can change it i
[1:54:55] can't change it
[1:54:57] i think god is bringing us to maturity
[1:54:59] friends
[1:55:01] so that the faith that's in us
[1:55:03] becomes the thing that dominates our
[1:55:05] lives
[1:55:06] a real faith a steady faith a solid
[1:55:09] faith not a bravado not a not an
[1:55:12] arrogance not a pride not a spitting at
[1:55:15] the devil that you can't listen you
[1:55:17] can't spit on the devil
[1:55:20] he's a spirit he's invisible you can't
[1:55:22] spit on you can't stomp on his head
[1:55:26] he doesn't have a physical head for you
[1:55:28] to stomp on amen at some point you have
[1:55:30] to say god's in control i believe the
[1:55:33] word of god and god i'm taking you at
[1:55:34] your word and i'm trusting you to do
[1:55:36] what only you can do
[1:55:39] at some point you have to say god i'm in
[1:55:41] your hands not mine
[1:55:45] if you don't protect me i'm not
[1:55:46] protected
[1:55:48] if you don't feed me i'm not fed
[1:55:51] if you don't if you don't provide for me
[1:55:53] then i'll go without but i can't i can't
[1:55:56] make my own mind i'll just follow your
[1:55:59] word and trust in you i'm not going to
[1:56:01] take care of myself anymore with my own
[1:56:03] end to life i'm going to stand on your
[1:56:05] word and watch you keep your word
[1:56:08] the bride has got to come to a higher
[1:56:10] level of faith and that higher level of
[1:56:13] faith is not not i mean look at abraham
[1:56:16] when he comes to the perfection of faith
[1:56:19] he's not casting mountains into the sea
[1:56:23] god says slay your son he gets up and
[1:56:25] starts packing a donkey
[1:56:28] come on son
[1:56:31] what are you going to do
[1:56:32] we're going to go
[1:56:34] kill my son
[1:56:36] what is this this is perfect faith
[1:56:40] but but isn't he the one that god told
[1:56:43] you that the seed your seed shall be in
[1:56:46] isaac and isaac shall there see be
[1:56:48] called yeah he's the one
[1:56:50] what do you think maybe god has changed
[1:56:51] his mind or something no he's the one
[1:56:54] then what are you going to do i'm going
[1:56:54] to go kill him but you said he's the one
[1:56:56] how do you reconcile these two thoughts
[1:56:58] it's not up to me to reconcile these two
[1:57:01] thoughts it's up to me to obey the word
[1:57:03] of god god will reconcile these two
[1:57:05] thoughts
[1:57:08] come on let's go
[1:57:10] dad what are we doing we're going to
[1:57:12] make a sacrifice where's the lamb god
[1:57:14] will provide for himself a lamb
[1:57:16] and that became the spoken word that
[1:57:18] created
[1:57:19] a created lamb
[1:57:23] this to me this is just me this to me is
[1:57:26] perfect faith
[1:57:28] it wasn't a public show
[1:57:31] it didn't bring any kind of accolades or
[1:57:34] merits to abraham it wasn't there to
[1:57:37] prove anything to anybody else it was
[1:57:39] abraham alone with his son on a
[1:57:41] mountaintop and god did the supernatural
[1:57:43] because he believed his word to me this
[1:57:46] is perfect faith
[1:57:48] and when i read this story i can see
[1:57:50] myself all the way through
[1:57:53] i can see the missteps i can see the
[1:57:55] immaturity i can see the wrong idea
[1:57:57] about how the word will be accomplished
[1:57:59] i can see i can see when you look back
[1:58:01] and i can see myself friends
[1:58:04] abraham had a few i have multitudes of
[1:58:06] those stories
[1:58:08] but i said god if you can bring me this
[1:58:10] far would you bring me to this kind of
[1:58:12] perfect faith where i can just humbly
[1:58:14] follow after you and watch you do the
[1:58:16] supernatural and watch you do what i
[1:58:18] can't do can we finally come to the
[1:58:22] place where we have confidence in god
[1:58:23] and just in god
[1:58:25] are we always going to be mixing this
[1:58:27] confidence in god with confidence in
[1:58:29] ourselves
[1:58:32] say it's time to say humanly
[1:58:34] naturally physically i can't do it
[1:58:39] but if i'll just keep believing him
[1:58:42] and keep stepping where he says step and
[1:58:44] keep walking where he says walk
[1:58:46] he'll do everything he promised to do
[1:58:52] what a journey we're on friends
[1:58:55] for me this is just me
[1:58:58] i feel god saying grow up chad
[1:59:03] it's time to quit acting childish
[1:59:06] time to quit shaking your fist at the
[1:59:08] world
[1:59:10] and just trust in the word of god
[1:59:13] it's not
[1:59:15] you know it's not even our job to
[1:59:17] explain everything we can't explain
[1:59:19] everything in the message it's not our
[1:59:21] job to defend the message we can't
[1:59:22] defend the message
[1:59:25] it's not our job to make everybody see
[1:59:26] we can't make everybody see what can we
[1:59:28] do we can we can believe what god shows
[1:59:31] us and act accordingly
[1:59:33] and if we can keep believing what god
[1:59:35] chose and acting accordingly he'll take
[1:59:37] care of the rest
[1:59:39] and i just believe that more than i ever
[1:59:41] did before
[1:59:44] i want to read this last quote and as i
[1:59:45] read that musicians if you'd like to
[1:59:47] come
[1:59:48] brother john if you'll make your way up
[1:59:50] in the message the god of this evil age
[1:59:52] he says we find now this evil age is to
[1:59:55] prove to satan she is not like eve
[1:59:59] now she is not that type of woman and
[2:00:01] she will be tried by his word
[2:00:04] the bride as adam's bride was tried by
[2:00:06] the word and adam's bride believed every
[2:00:09] bit of the word all but confused on one
[2:00:11] promise that he's the same yesterday
[2:00:13] today and forever today see but failed
[2:00:16] on one promise under the temptation of
[2:00:18] the enemy face to face and now the
[2:00:20] people that's called for his name of
[2:00:22] course is his bride she is to come in
[2:00:25] contact again by the same thing not by
[2:00:28] just denominational truth or something
[2:00:30] but every word
[2:00:33] amen eve was tried
[2:00:35] the first church age was tried the
[2:00:37] nation of israel was tried amen this
[2:00:40] bride will be tried shall be tried by
[2:00:42] the word and shall stand by the word
[2:00:46] not her own
[2:00:47] not her own anything she'll stand by the
[2:00:50] word
[2:00:51] i mean let's all stand
[2:00:54] i said god
[2:00:56] make me faithful
[2:01:00] faith isn't what i used to think faith
[2:01:02] was
[2:01:07] faith
[2:01:09] i used to think faith was like being
[2:01:11] really loud and screaming at the devil
[2:01:14] i mean i was raised pentecostal so i
[2:01:15] mean forgive me
[2:01:18] i started off as a baby
[2:01:20] faith
[2:01:21] faith for me was rhetoric
[2:01:25] but i had a lot of strong rhetoric
[2:01:27] because down inside i had a little fear
[2:01:30] and the more you're afraid the louder
[2:01:32] your rhetoric becomes
[2:01:36] but what i've experienced
[2:01:38] is the more faith i have the quieter i
[2:01:41] get about things
[2:01:45] the more i believe god's going to work
[2:01:46] it out the less i fret over it the less
[2:01:49] i talk about it and the less i shout at
[2:01:51] the devil
[2:01:54] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[2:01:58] i want to have mature faith
[2:02:00] i want to have a faith that's dependable
[2:02:03] that doesn't leave me that's not
[2:02:05] dependent on me working something out
[2:02:07] but something that just solidly laying
[2:02:09] there said he's taken care of me before
[2:02:11] he'll take care of me again
[2:02:13] he's called me for a purpose and
[2:02:14] nothing's going to happen to me till his
[2:02:16] purpose is finished nothing can happen
[2:02:18] to me unless it first crosses his desk
[2:02:20] and i believe it and i'm going to accept
[2:02:22] what comes and believe that he'll bring
[2:02:23] me out of it all because the scripture
[2:02:25] says many are the afflictions of the
[2:02:26] righteous but he is the one that
[2:02:28] delivers them out of them all
[2:02:31] so i just believe god and i want to
[2:02:33] believe him more and i say god give us
[2:02:35] this kind of faith that abraham had and
[2:02:38] i believe that's the kind of faith he's
[2:02:39] bringing us to friends
[2:02:42] say
[2:02:42] when we look back and say yep i did that
[2:02:45] and i did that and i did that
[2:02:47] but he brought me back out of that
[2:02:50] he he brought me through that he brought
[2:02:52] me to where i am today and i'm going to
[2:02:54] look forward to say god you've kept me
[2:02:56] there you'll keep me here
[2:02:58] i'm going to keep walking and trusting
[2:02:59] in you
[2:03:01] amen
[2:03:02] these things that are happening in the
[2:03:04] world
[2:03:05] they're only there to perfect the bride
[2:03:08] all of these things that we face and all
[2:03:10] the things that are going on i mean if
[2:03:12] you watch the news you can see all kinds
[2:03:14] of things are happening everywhere
[2:03:17] i just found out that there's like five
[2:03:19] or six nations that they're shutting
[2:03:20] down travel to the southern part of
[2:03:22] africa
[2:03:23] and they stopped in malawi and
[2:03:24] mozambique guess what's just above allah
[2:03:26] malawi mozambique
[2:03:28] uganda
[2:03:29] [Applause]
[2:03:31] what can you do about it
[2:03:34] i can scream at the devil
[2:03:36] but god's in control
[2:03:39] i'll tell you the thing that i want most
[2:03:42] is not to go to uganda
[2:03:44] is to come home from uganda
[2:03:50] i would like to have a guarantee that
[2:03:52] i'm coming home
[2:03:56] but i believe god called me there
[2:03:57] because of the circumstance and i
[2:03:58] believe he'll get me home
[2:04:01] it's not a plane it'd be a boat be a
[2:04:03] train
[2:04:04] but i believe i just trust in god
[2:04:07] the world is in such a chaos you could
[2:04:10] make travel plans one day they could be
[2:04:12] interrupted the next you could be
[2:04:13] somewhere and borders could shut down
[2:04:15] but you know what when all of that
[2:04:17] happened before god could took care of
[2:04:19] everybody
[2:04:20] and he'll do it again
[2:04:22] we can't operate by fear we have to
[2:04:24] trust in the lord if we are who we
[2:04:26] believe we are and he is who we believe
[2:04:29] he is then we have to act like it
[2:04:33] i say for me it's time to grow up and
[2:04:35] start acting like him quit running
[2:04:38] around when things happen it's time to
[2:04:39] quiet down and say
[2:04:41] all is well
[2:04:43] all is well everything is under control
[2:04:46] i'm trusting in god
[2:04:48] man let's bow our heads and pray
[2:04:51] lord jesus we thank you for the
[2:04:53] privilege lord
[2:04:55] of gathering together we thank you god
[2:04:57] for your word and for the picture that
[2:04:59] you painted for us
[2:05:01] in your word
[2:05:02] god i thank you personally i thank you
[2:05:04] for the life of abraham
[2:05:07] i thank you god that you wrote
[2:05:08] everything in the bible the way you
[2:05:10] wrote it
[2:05:11] so that i could see a true picture
[2:05:14] because if all i had was an account in
[2:05:17] hebrews i wouldn't understand
[2:05:19] how you could work with me
[2:05:22] but because you wrote it out in the book
[2:05:24] of genesis and showed us the missteps
[2:05:27] the wrong thinking the wrong actions
[2:05:30] lord i've got more confidence than ever
[2:05:32] that what you did for brother abraham
[2:05:34] you can do for me
[2:05:37] he's the father of the faith
[2:05:39] by faith i'm a seed of abraham
[2:05:41] the way you guided him you can guide me
[2:05:44] lord i'm so thankful for your word
[2:05:47] i pray god that you would just purge out
[2:05:49] of me all of the
[2:05:51] the selfishness lord all of the
[2:05:53] self-preservation
[2:05:56] all of the wrong ideas and wrong concept
[2:05:58] purge it out of me lord
[2:06:01] and let me just see myself in your hand
[2:06:04] in every circumstance i'm in your hand
[2:06:07] through every trial i'm in your hand
[2:06:09] lord everything that comes and goes i'm
[2:06:11] in your hand lord let me have confidence
[2:06:13] in that and quit lord acting and
[2:06:16] reacting in the flesh but lord let me
[2:06:18] stay spiritual and see that you're in
[2:06:20] control of it all
[2:06:22] god these times have been hard
[2:06:25] but god worst times are coming
[2:06:28] god trained us through these things to
[2:06:30] be able to stand in these hours of
[2:06:31] temptation and trial
[2:06:33] may we stand with your word and your
[2:06:35] word alone
[2:06:37] no human effort no human reasoning no
[2:06:39] human strength no will of our own no
[2:06:41] self-preservation but let us just stand
[2:06:44] and say god i trust you here
[2:06:46] show yourself mighty on our behalf again
[2:06:50] we love you lord we commit ourselves
[2:06:52] into your hands we thank you for your
[2:06:54] provision and how you've protected us
[2:06:55] and taking care of us through it all
[2:06:58] we ask that you would bless us as we go
[2:07:00] from here maybe we walk on this earth in
[2:07:03] confidence lord that you're watching
[2:07:04] over us like you watched over abraham
[2:07:07] and every step we take is not outside of
[2:07:09] your sight
[2:07:11] and when needed you'll come down and
[2:07:13] you'll move things along like you did
[2:07:14] for abraham
[2:07:16] let us walk forward with this confidence
[2:07:18] and this joy in our hearts that all is
[2:07:20] well
[2:07:21] and you're working your plan
[2:07:23] and we're quickly coming to the finish
[2:07:25] line of that plan
[2:07:27] lord manifest yourself through your
[2:07:29] bride in this last day
[2:07:31] we commit ourselves into you
[2:07:33] in jesus christ's name we pray
[2:07:36] amen
[2:07:38] when we come to genesis 22
[2:07:41] for me what's on display greater than
[2:07:43] anything
[2:07:44] is preeminence
[2:07:47] who was having the preeminence in
[2:07:48] genesis 22
[2:07:50] god was having the preeminence
[2:07:53] we know god's had a great plan and
[2:07:54] threefold the threefold purpose is all
[2:07:57] about preeminence preeminence in a man
[2:07:59] he got that in christ jesus preeminence
[2:08:01] in the people he's getting that now
[2:08:03] i say god
[2:08:05] have your preeminence in me
[2:08:07] man god bless you we love you
[2:08:09] brother john
[2:08:12] i came to hear
[2:08:15] the word
[2:08:17] and with each line in
[2:08:22] [Music]
[2:08:27] he
[2:08:28] was
[2:08:30] drawing me
[2:08:32] to give
[2:08:34] a higher praise
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:50] like a great
[2:08:53] magnet
[2:08:54] calling me
[2:08:57] i
[2:08:58] know for sure
[2:09:01] that i'll reach the goal
[2:09:04] because i feel
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:12] i feel
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:19] i
[2:09:20] hear the
[2:09:22] fall
[2:09:27] and i know his
