[0:08] that he's able
[0:10] to keep that which i've committed
[0:16] to him against that day
[0:21] praise the lord god bless you brothers
[0:24] we'll let you be seated for a minute
[0:26] i'd like for you to take out your bibles
[0:29] i'd like to read a psalm together as you
[0:32] can probably guess i'm not preaching
[0:33] tonight brother kyle's going to be
[0:35] taking the service for us
[0:36] and so i appreciate him being able to do
[0:38] that
[0:40] for us tonight i told him it's like a
[0:42] men's meeting
[0:43] praise the lord he just preached to the
[0:45] men but all the women are listening so
[0:47] you better be careful what you say
[0:49] amen so let's uh let's look at psalm 34
[0:53] together
[0:56] i said so many times when you find
[0:57] yourself in trouble or
[0:59] when there's when there's chaos going on
[1:01] or things are upended
[1:02] the psalms are so comforting because
[1:05] that's how david found himself many
[1:07] times
[1:08] and he wrote the psalms out of times
[1:10] like that
[1:11] so they're very comforting so psalm 34
[1:13] verse 1 let's read together
[1:15] i will bless the lord at all times his
[1:17] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[1:20] my soul shall make her boast in the lord
[1:22] the humble shall hear thereof and be
[1:24] glad
[1:24] o magnify the lord with me and let us
[1:27] exalt his name together
[1:30] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[1:32] delivered me from all my fears
[1:34] they looked unto him and were lightened
[1:36] and their faces were not ashamed
[1:38] this poor man cried and the lord heard
[1:40] him and saved him out of all of his
[1:42] troubles
[1:43] the angel of the lord encampeth round
[1:45] about them that fear him
[1:46] and delivereth them oh taste and see
[1:49] that the lord is good
[1:50] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[1:53] oh fear the lord ye sent
[1:55] you his saints for there is no want to
[1:57] them that fear him
[1:58] the young lions do lack and suffer
[2:01] hunger
[2:02] but they that seek the lord shall not
[2:04] want any good thing
[2:05] come ye children hearken unto me i will
[2:08] teach you the fear of the lord
[2:10] what man is he that desireth life and
[2:12] love with many days that he may see good
[2:15] keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[2:17] from speaking guile
[2:18] depart from evil and do good seek peace
[2:21] and pursue it
[2:22] the eyes of the lord are upon the
[2:24] righteous and his ears are upon
[2:26] open unto their cry the face of the lord
[2:29] is against them that do evil to cut off
[2:31] the remembrance of them from the earth
[2:33] the righteous cry and the lord heareth
[2:35] and delivereth them out of all their
[2:37] troubles
[2:38] the lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[2:39] broken heart and saveth such as be of a
[2:42] contrite spirit
[2:43] many are the afflictions of the
[2:45] righteous but the lord delivereth him
[2:47] out of them all he keepeth all his bones
[2:50] not one of them is broken
[2:52] evil shall slay the wicked and and they
[2:55] that hate the righteous shall be
[2:56] desolate
[2:57] the lord redeemeth the soul of his
[2:59] servants and none of them that trusted
[3:01] him
[3:01] shall be desolate amen what promise we
[3:04] have in the word
[3:06] what consolation we have in the word we
[3:08] must always keep the word before our
[3:10] eyes
[3:11] amen and that's what david was able to
[3:13] do in all of his trouble
[3:14] david knew who he was he knew he was the
[3:17] son of god
[3:18] he knew he was called of god and he knew
[3:20] who god was
[3:21] and if we can keep these two things in
[3:23] our mind all the time that we know who
[3:25] we are
[3:26] and we know who god is amen everything
[3:29] else comes into perspective
[3:31] we can't help things you know troubling
[3:33] news and
[3:34] and difficult situations we can't help
[3:36] them from having an effect on us in our
[3:38] minds and
[3:39] our emotions that's that's normal but
[3:41] there's something in the soul
[3:43] that knows where it came from and
[3:45] there's something in the soul longing to
[3:46] go back to where it came from
[3:48] that recognizes the word and recognizes
[3:50] the power and majesty of god
[3:53] and sometimes we just got to dig a
[3:54] little bit deeper till we hit that thing
[3:56] that sparks the life and say
[3:57] everything is under control nothing is
[4:00] out of kilter the clock's ticking right
[4:02] on time
[4:03] all these things has to be this way and
[4:05] rest comes back into our hearts
[4:08] and so that's where we find ourselves in
[4:10] troublesome times
[4:11] but praise god everything's okay
[4:14] everything all is well in my soul
[4:16] and in this in the scripture that we
[4:18] read how many times did he say he
[4:20] delivers them out of
[4:21] all their troubles all there's nothing
[4:24] that god is
[4:26] is not able to deliver us from all of
[4:28] our troubles
[4:29] amen and we thank god for that
[4:42] of the race
[5:02] god bless you all this evening good to
[5:04] see you brothers
[5:06] and uh thank you musicians i think
[5:08] that'll that'll be it for now
[5:11] i've been told my microphone's not on
[5:14] sorry is that better okay god bless you
[5:17] all
[5:18] so good to see you this evening and uh
[5:21] obviously it's a little strange it's
[5:23] just pointing out the obvious
[5:25] but uh i greet the invisible audience
[5:29] that's not with us i
[5:30] trust you're doing well and trusting
[5:32] there's a smile on your face as you're
[5:34] conducting yourselves with joy in the
[5:36] midst of trials that
[5:37] we're entering into by his predetermined
[5:40] will
[5:41] to accomplish and to bring about his
[5:44] great desire
[5:45] that he has in us i'll let you have your
[5:47] seats for just a moment okay if that's
[5:48] okay i knew i'd be a little bit nervous
[5:50] so i thought i'd maybe uh give you a
[5:52] couple updates here from some brothers
[5:54] just to talk for a little bit and relax
[5:55] myself you all right that
[5:57] nobody's going to complain are they so
[5:59] um
[6:00] i want to let everybody know that i
[6:02] heard from brother abraham brother
[6:04] alfred brother paddington for the dawn
[6:06] done by the james for the danny brother
[6:07] june and andre in the last 24 hours
[6:10] and it wasn't me reaching out to them
[6:11] they were reaching out to us
[6:13] and surprisingly they were pretty much
[6:16] all of them were letting us know they're
[6:18] praying for us
[6:19] and i thought that was really
[6:20] encouraging to hear and brother
[6:23] brother oswald was also he had said that
[6:25] his entire church were gathering
[6:27] i believe tonight at 6 pm or there
[6:29] tonight at 6 pm just to pray for us
[6:32] and they had been and he had been
[6:33] fasting and praying for us for the last
[6:35] four days and
[6:36] i just was really encouraged by that and
[6:38] i think you know well praise the lord we
[6:39] we really appreciate that little little
[6:41] difficulties like this seem to just kind
[6:43] of drive us all together i think that's
[6:45] a good thing in it right
[6:47] and um you know brother don don had let
[6:49] me know you know so
[6:50] we have some discomforts here obviously
[6:52] i would like to see everybody but you
[6:53] know brother don don had shared with me
[6:55] he says you know brother he says
[6:57] they've got armed militia at the entries
[6:59] of all of our cities i'm not allowed to
[7:01] leave my little
[7:02] village nobody's allowed in nobody's
[7:04] allowed out
[7:05] and brother abraham had mentioned to me
[7:07] he says you know i'm not even allowed to
[7:08] drive his personal car he sent me a
[7:10] voice message this morning
[7:12] not allowed to drive be on the public
[7:14] roads
[7:15] nothing and he says and we don't have
[7:17] the technology
[7:20] gadgets and such he said as you have to
[7:22] be able to stream
[7:23] uh really we're disconnected from the
[7:25] people so he said you know we're
[7:27] me and the d and they're i think it's
[7:28] illegal to have more than five he also
[7:30] said there's
[7:31] it's very serious over there um
[7:34] and everything is completely shut down
[7:36] and he had said you know we're just
[7:38] doing our best me and the deacons to go
[7:39] home to home
[7:40] and minister to the needs of the people
[7:42] individually so
[7:44] i liked that idea so if you see me
[7:46] standing outside your window
[7:48] and i'm waving to you i liked it so much
[7:50] i think i'm gonna start doing that so
[7:52] don't be shocked it's not a stranger
[7:53] don't shoot me
[7:54] i'm there to say hello god bless you and
[7:57] uh
[7:57] and be with you for a few minutes i like
[7:59] that i thought that would be a good
[8:00] thing
[8:01] god has a purpose in all of these
[8:02] difficulties and
[8:04] i did also want to let you know that
[8:06] also you know brother abraham um
[8:09] i well brother alfred we did send some
[8:11] funds to
[8:12] in malawi about 400 people and the
[8:15] problem is you know it's not america
[8:17] where we're all getting
[8:18] unemployment checks or a stimulus check
[8:22] they shut the entire country down all
[8:24] business shuts down they can do nothing
[8:27] and that really affects them severely
[8:30] and especially the poor that's amongst
[8:32] them because they
[8:33] like brother alfred said the food prices
[8:35] have doubled and tripled
[8:37] in these areas and the people aren't
[8:39] allowed to work they're not allowed to
[8:40] do anything to make any money and they
[8:42] live
[8:42] you know week by week so we've we've
[8:45] sent some funds there and
[8:46] lord willing will be able to send some
[8:48] more uh to help them and they so
[8:50] appreciated us being able to do that so
[8:52] just letting you know but keep them in
[8:54] prayer it's a tough time for them
[8:56] it seems like you know i think they used
[8:58] to say when america sneezes the rest of
[9:00] the world gets a cold
[9:01] so the little discomforts that we're
[9:03] feeling will magnify them by ten and
[9:05] that's what our brothers and sisters are
[9:07] experiencing
[9:08] in some of the third world countries and
[9:10] won't be mindful of that but
[9:12] also we were able to send some funds to
[9:15] brother james toronto he does a lot that
[9:18] the same things that brother don don
[9:19] does in the area of the country that
[9:20] he's
[9:21] he's placed and uh and also we did send
[9:24] some funds to brother don don and
[9:25] brother dawn dawn said that he was going
[9:27] to take those funds and distribute it
[9:29] about five other
[9:30] close brothers there to have churches
[9:32] and and do what they can to
[9:33] to buy as much food as they can so
[9:36] as more information comes be sure to
[9:38] share it with you and you know as always
[9:40] keep it in your prayers and lord moves
[9:41] on you anything just
[9:43] put something on the admissions on the
[9:46] tithe
[9:46] and we'll make sure we we get it to you
[9:48] get it to them as best we
[9:50] can so but god has a purpose in all
[9:52] these things it's nothing to be upset
[9:54] about god
[9:55] i i think it's a good thing i think
[9:57] discomfort is a good thing
[9:59] i think in any form and fashion it can
[10:01] come in it's a good thing
[10:03] we just get too comfortable as a people
[10:05] way way too comfortable
[10:07] and i think god has got to discomfort
[10:09] the bride
[10:10] i think he's got to push her and get her
[10:13] out of that nest so that she'll start to
[10:14] actually
[10:15] accomplish his great purpose and will
[10:18] and sometimes it's not always
[10:20] what you think and that's kind of
[10:22] something i want to talk about tonight
[10:23] i can only go as i feel led as i feel
[10:25] inspired and then when i'm done i'm done
[10:28] and so please give me enough grace to
[10:31] realize i
[10:32] have a little inspiration and i'm gonna
[10:33] deliver it and i feel uh
[10:35] inadequate to go any farther than that
[10:38] so
[10:39] um but we'll see where the lord wants to
[10:41] take that so
[10:43] if you'll stand with me now
[10:48] i'd like you to turn to ecclesiastes
[10:51] chapter 3.
[10:58] ecclesiastes chapters 3.
[11:11] now don't be too quiet on me either okay
[11:13] so there's not many people here but
[11:15] i like to hear your voices so you do
[11:17] anything you want to do just make more
[11:18] noise than you used to right so
[11:20] i like to know there's somebody before
[11:21] me speaking
[11:23] yeah so you you feel free you're quiet
[11:25] once brother jeremy i want to hear
[11:27] amends from the back
[11:28] yeah amen all right so
[11:32] good deal so ecclesiastes chapters 3
[11:36] to everything there is a season and a
[11:39] time to every purpose
[11:41] under the sun under heaven a time to be
[11:43] born and a time to die
[11:45] a time to plant and a time to pluck up
[11:48] that which is planted
[11:49] a time to kill and a time to heal a time
[11:53] to break down
[11:54] and a time to build up a time to weep
[11:57] and a time to laugh a time to mourn
[12:00] a time to dance a time to cast away
[12:03] stones
[12:04] and a time to gather stones together a
[12:07] time to embrace
[12:08] and a time to refrain from embracing
[12:12] i thought that's an interesting
[12:13] scripture that's not exactly
[12:15] the point of why i went to this and
[12:17] it'll you'll see it's a different
[12:19] and there's a reason sometimes you
[12:21] cannot just
[12:22] comfort someone when they really want
[12:24] comforted you create a hindrance for
[12:27] them
[12:27] right brother branham made a comment one
[12:29] time i think a brother told him he said
[12:31] brother
[12:31] branham if you let him lean on you today
[12:33] you'll be packing them tomorrow
[12:35] and he said that's right because that's
[12:36] human nature human nature does that
[12:39] so here is i believe that's in the
[12:41] reference by which he's saying it's not
[12:42] so much that there could be a time where
[12:44] they ban us from hugging each other
[12:45] i think it's there comes points and
[12:47] times in the maturing process of every
[12:49] son and every daughter
[12:50] you have to stand back and let them
[12:51] endure the difficulty in the situation
[12:54] that they find themselves to be in
[12:56] a time to get and a time to lose a time
[13:00] to keep and a time to cast away
[13:02] a time to rend and a time to sow a time
[13:06] to keep silence
[13:07] and the time to speak a time to love
[13:11] and a time to hate a time of war
[13:14] and a time of peace and also if you will
[13:19] turn in your bibles to ephesians 6 10.
[13:32] ephesians 6 10
[13:39] it says here finally my brethren be
[13:41] strong in the lord and in the power of
[13:43] his might
[13:44] put on the whole armor of god that you
[13:46] may be able to stand
[13:48] against the wiles of the devil for we
[13:50] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[13:51] against principalities against powers
[13:53] against rulers
[13:54] of the darkness of this world and
[13:56] against spiritual wickedness in high
[13:58] places
[13:59] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[14:01] of god that you may be able to withstand
[14:04] in the evil day and having done all to
[14:07] stand
[14:08] stand therefore having your loins squirt
[14:10] about with truth
[14:11] and having on the breastplate of
[14:13] righteousness and your feet
[14:14] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[14:16] of peace above all taking the shield of
[14:19] faith
[14:19] wherewith ye may be able to quench all
[14:21] the fiery darts of the wicked
[14:23] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[14:26] sword of the spirit
[14:27] which is the word of god praying always
[14:30] with all prayer and supplication in the
[14:32] spirit
[14:33] watching there and too with all
[14:35] perseverance and supplication
[14:37] for all saints i'd like to just title
[14:41] this little thought of bride's time to
[14:42] stand
[14:44] so if you will just bow your heads with
[14:46] me for a word of prayer
[14:49] most gracious heavenly father we always
[14:52] deem this an honor and a privilege that
[14:54] we can gather
[14:54] though we be few in number lord we are
[14:56] honored that we know you're here in our
[14:58] presence
[14:59] the word said wherever two or three are
[15:01] gathered in my name there i am
[15:03] father we know that there's physical
[15:05] presence gathered here and there's also
[15:07] a
[15:07] presence online watching the service so
[15:09] lord we have us
[15:10] confidence in the promise of your word
[15:12] that you are with us
[15:14] now father god i just pray that you
[15:16] would take the words that will be spoken
[15:18] tonight and the things that we're
[15:19] looking at and lord will you just take
[15:21] it and anoint it
[15:22] and lord accomplish that which you have
[15:25] purposed it to
[15:26] accomplish for you promised in your word
[15:28] that your word would never return unto
[15:30] you void
[15:30] and father i know that i'm unable i know
[15:34] that i have no ability i have no
[15:36] confidence in myself
[15:37] i am walking out here by faith looking
[15:40] to you
[15:40] to take me lord to move me to anoint me
[15:43] lord recognizing i cannot do
[15:45] anything without you and every time i
[15:48] failed you is when i thought i could do
[15:49] something lord
[15:50] i realize i'm inadequate at this hour so
[15:53] father
[15:54] god i just pray that you would take this
[15:56] time take the words take me move me out
[15:58] of the way
[15:59] take the people move them out of the way
[16:01] give them the ears to hear and eyes to
[16:02] see
[16:03] the things that you want us to see so
[16:05] that we conduct ourselves
[16:07] the way that would please you father we
[16:09] love you we thank you
[16:10] in jesus name amen you may be seated
[16:18] it is just too quiet
[16:23] so so uh
[16:26] so here we go
[16:30] on sunday you all know god deals with me
[16:33] a little bit funny at this point so i
[16:35] i always like to make sure that um
[16:39] that if if god's in something i share it
[16:41] with you because i i feel
[16:42] this this position really scares me it
[16:44] always has scared me it's a very scary
[16:46] thing to stand behind a pulpit
[16:48] very scary thing and i don't ever take
[16:50] it lightly and so
[16:52] god knows i'm just so utterly dependent
[16:54] upon him that i just don't ever know
[16:56] what to say or how to move or even what
[16:58] to bring to the people unless i know
[17:00] he's led me to say something and
[17:03] so on sunday i so enjoyed the service on
[17:06] sunday and
[17:07] and uh i was writing down some notes and
[17:09] really enjoying the service and
[17:11] as i'm sitting there um i know when god
[17:14] starts to bring an anointing or
[17:15] it just starts to bring a little
[17:16] something to me and i felt it swoop back
[17:19] over there across me and
[17:21] when he does i go to the other side of
[17:22] the page from where i'm writing notes
[17:24] for brother chad and i just write
[17:25] i just started writing down some
[17:27] thoughts and and i had a funny feeling
[17:29] when that happens usually i get asked to
[17:31] minister and actually i sat there and i
[17:33] thought oh he's going to ask me
[17:35] he's going to ask me and i mean i'm
[17:37] before the lord that was the truth i
[17:39] just started writing notes and i thought
[17:41] i don't want to right now i don't
[17:45] i really don't want to so uh so as
[17:48] i was sitting there and i wrote down
[17:49] those notes i had um
[17:52] i wrote down some different things and
[17:55] one of the things i wrote down was she's
[17:58] built to stand and
[18:00] and i i wrote down the pyramid and the
[18:03] enoch
[18:04] and i wrote down the two fathers
[18:08] and i started to think about it for just
[18:10] a moment just the thought past my mind i
[18:12] said you know
[18:13] the devil trains his children and
[18:15] constantly puts them in a position where
[18:17] they're utterly dependent upon him for
[18:19] everything
[18:21] they need his alcohol they need his
[18:23] cigarettes they need his entertainment
[18:26] they need his
[18:27] women they need his uh luxuries
[18:30] constantly to bring them joy peace
[18:33] satisfaction any of the things that we
[18:36] have
[18:36] by a free gift of almighty god he
[18:38] creates such a dependency upon himself
[18:41] and he keeps him so
[18:42] tied to him that they can't even
[18:45] function in this world
[18:46] without his devices and i had remember
[18:49] one time at my office there there was a
[18:52] lady that she she worked in our office
[18:54] and and she always had an earbud in i
[18:56] said
[18:56] what are you listening to all the time
[18:57] and she said oh this and she turned it
[18:59] up on her
[19:00] on her computer and it's just like hard
[19:01] rock and roll i said my goodness i said
[19:04] that thing would drive me crazy if i
[19:05] listen to that she said if i didn't
[19:07] listen to it i would go crazy
[19:10] and i see so the devil this is how he
[19:12] trains his children
[19:14] he gets them into an utter reliance and
[19:16] need
[19:17] for him to just stay sane in this insane
[19:21] world
[19:22] and it's a paradox it's really an odd
[19:24] thing but i got to thinking too but
[19:26] my father trains me differently our
[19:28] father is training us to be able to
[19:30] stand against
[19:31] everything the devil could shoot our way
[19:33] or bring our way
[19:34] and it doesn't matter i don't i honestly
[19:36] believe that
[19:37] that the sign of maturity is a complete
[19:40] utter independence
[19:42] by a dependence on his word that i don't
[19:45] need
[19:46] anything but a revelation of my position
[19:49] in christ who i am what he's done for me
[19:53] and that word because i know heavens and
[19:55] earth pass away but that word never
[19:56] fails
[19:57] and as long as i have that revelation i
[19:59] know who i
[20:00] am i know what i where i've came from i
[20:02] know what he's done for me
[20:03] i also know i'm not what i want to be
[20:05] but i know i'm not what i used to be
[20:07] i got a lot of other things i could look
[20:09] at and be like well
[20:10] but i know what he's brought me from and
[20:12] i know where i'm standing
[20:14] and nobody can has to tell me and nobody
[20:16] can persuade me otherwise
[20:18] i know who i am and i know where i'm
[20:20] standing and so i stand on that solid
[20:22] rock and god has given me an
[20:24] independence from the themes of this
[20:25] world
[20:26] i don't need any of the devices that the
[20:28] world could offer me
[20:29] i have a joy unspeakable and nothing of
[20:32] the world is giving it to me
[20:34] anymore you're finding yourselves joyful
[20:36] you lost your job and you're happy
[20:38] you're at home with the family you've
[20:40] got more time to listen to sermons
[20:42] praise god this is an you are a paradox
[20:45] to this world
[20:46] aren't you sad aren't you concerned
[20:48] aren't you fearful no
[20:50] i have a revelation i'm his i'm his son
[20:53] i'm his daughter if you're online
[20:54] there's no sisters i'm talking to but
[20:56] nonetheless you know you have a
[20:57] revelation of this position
[21:00] in christ and it creates such a boldness
[21:02] such a boldness to be able to stand
[21:04] in the midst of every obstacle that
[21:06] comes our way right
[21:08] so as i wrote down those notes and then
[21:11] i
[21:11] walked outside and brother chad be lined
[21:13] it over to me and then he asked me is
[21:15] i knew you were going to ask me man okay
[21:18] so you know i uh i i but i never know
[21:22] what i'm going to preach i know
[21:23] sometimes i think you know like a
[21:24] minister's just got these stacked
[21:25] sermons he's just ready to come out
[21:27] there that is the farthest thing from
[21:29] here
[21:29] i didn't even know what i was totally
[21:30] preaching i still don't know what i'm
[21:32] preaching so come on now i really have
[21:34] no clue
[21:35] you're right brother ben you don't
[21:36] really know you think you know and
[21:38] you think you come up here to do this
[21:39] and he wants to take you this way you
[21:40] just i just don't know
[21:42] and then so you know so i all i know to
[21:45] do
[21:46] is consecrate myself get in the word
[21:48] stay in the word feed on the word
[21:49] keep my mind constantly meditating ask
[21:52] him lord what do you want for your
[21:53] people
[21:53] i've got nothing to glory in i really
[21:55] don't care what anybody thinks about me
[21:57] if you'll just give me something that
[21:58] brings you glory and it helps your
[21:59] people i'll be happy with it
[22:01] let me be a bastion the whole thing i
[22:02] really don't care and
[22:04] so as i'm as i'm preparing and and
[22:07] looking at
[22:07] listening to things i start listening to
[22:09] why christ speak
[22:10] and as i'm listening to why christ speak
[22:13] my you know something inside of me is
[22:15] like
[22:15] i'm ready i'm let let me go let me
[22:18] where's the son that i need to call and
[22:20] stand still right
[22:21] i'm like let me after the enemy i ain't
[22:24] gonna cry to you god
[22:25] i'm i'm ready to take the head off the
[22:27] enemy get out of the way right
[22:30] and as i'm listening to that that's
[22:31] where that's kind of the inspiration i'm
[22:32] going in
[22:33] and he point blank stop me point blank
[22:37] flat out nope not it
[22:41] so i want to take your attention back to
[22:42] ephesians 6.
[22:46] if you still have your bibles open
[22:54] because this is a bit of a paradox
[22:58] in ephesians 6 finally my brethren be
[23:00] strong in the lord in the power of his
[23:02] might putting on the whole armor of god
[23:04] that you may be able to stand
[23:05] against the wiles of the devil for we
[23:07] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[23:08] against principalities powers against
[23:10] rulers
[23:11] of darkness of this world against
[23:12] spiritual wickedness in high places
[23:14] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[23:16] of god that you may be able withstand
[23:18] in the evil day having done all to stand
[23:20] stand therefore
[23:21] having your going loin skirt about with
[23:24] truth
[23:24] having on the breastplate of
[23:25] righteousness your feet shot with the
[23:27] preparation of the gospel of peace
[23:30] so you read this and you in my mind i'm
[23:32] looking at i'm like
[23:33] got my sword i've got my shield
[23:37] i've got the imputed righteousness of
[23:39] jesus christ given unto me
[23:41] i've got the helmet of salvation
[23:43] checking out my shoes i got the
[23:45] i got my feet shot with the preparation
[23:47] the gospel
[23:48] buddy watch out here i go
[23:52] demons i'm coming after you and i said
[23:55] father just give me the word i'm ready
[23:58] he says
[23:58] stand still
[24:03] stand still like what
[24:07] you know all of us brother the same way
[24:08] we're like give me a sword in my hand
[24:10] i'm i'm
[24:10] cutting something something's getting
[24:11] cut you know something
[24:13] but that's how we feel that's how we put
[24:15] us in the position you know i'm
[24:16] listening to why christ speak
[24:18] i'm saying man i ain't crying i ain't
[24:20] crying i'm ready you get out of my way
[24:22] here i come
[24:23] devil i'm coming after you and everybody
[24:25] you got you know
[24:27] and i'm looking and he stops me in my
[24:29] tracks and i realize
[24:31] whoa hold on why would he adorn me with
[24:34] such armament i know i ain't going no
[24:36] picnic
[24:38] but i'm fully dressed out for battle and
[24:41] he's telling me stand still
[24:43] i don't want to stand still
[24:47] you know sometimes brother branham says
[24:49] you know the holy spirit is an
[24:51] action in you sometimes
[24:54] in our own carnal humanity we're looking
[24:57] for the people to be in certain action
[24:59] and then we'll believe or then we won't
[25:02] have the insecurity that we once had
[25:05] you know many things we're looking for
[25:06] god to use us in such a way because we
[25:07] have an insecurity we don't really have
[25:09] a revelation we know who we are
[25:11] we're looking for god to vindicate us
[25:13] we're looking for
[25:15] something on the outward appeal that'll
[25:17] be i
[25:18] i got it see god or the other people
[25:20] will see yeah see he's with us
[25:24] and that's insecurity that's not based
[25:26] upon a revelation
[25:28] a revelation i don't care what anybody
[25:30] thinks
[25:31] ten thousand fall on my right hand ten
[25:33] thousand fall on my left
[25:34] don't bother me i'm standing on a solid
[25:37] rock revelation
[25:38] i don't need an action and outward
[25:41] action because there's an inward action
[25:43] and that inward action
[25:44] brings me into this lord i'm ready to go
[25:48] but if you say stand i won't move
[25:51] i'm ready to go you've got me in
[25:54] position
[25:54] i fully believe the word the father i'm
[25:57] tempted to go
[25:59] there's people they're trying to get me
[26:00] out there i want to go
[26:02] cut off the head of demon the lord if
[26:04] you don't want me to i'll stand right
[26:06] here
[26:08] and i got to thinking about that today
[26:10] and i got to think you know there's
[26:11] another group maybe there's another
[26:12] group they've
[26:13] they're fully arrayed in garments you
[26:14] know
[26:16] and they say what do you mean stand
[26:18] still
[26:19] no no i've got faith to move mountains
[26:23] no no no see i'm ready to get my body to
[26:25] be burned
[26:27] no no i'm i'm ready i know that's what
[26:29] my chief captain's saying but i've got
[26:31] the faith to put it into action
[26:34] you know what he'll say right ahead go
[26:37] go right ahead i told you to stand still
[26:40] you wanted to go
[26:41] go right ahead you know what the
[26:44] follow-up bill
[26:45] will be depart from you worker of
[26:47] iniquity i don't know you
[26:50] my word couldn't find a resting place in
[26:51] you you had my word i told you stand
[26:54] still
[26:56] so i'm
[26:59] i'm wanting to go why christ speak lord
[27:02] tell me to go i'm ready to defy the
[27:03] government i'm ready to just blast
[27:05] through a whole you know
[27:07] and i wonder sometimes if there isn't
[27:09] just a time to hold your peace and be
[27:10] silent
[27:12] because ecclesiastes says there's a time
[27:13] for war and there's a time for peace
[27:16] there's a time to tear something down
[27:18] and then there's time to take the time
[27:20] to sew it back up there's time to give
[27:22] an embrace and then there's time to let
[27:24] them stand on their own
[27:26] it's because god's raising up a ch an
[27:29] army
[27:29] a royal seed his children have to come
[27:32] to a full maturity you know
[27:34] i want to be you know depart
[27:37] red sea you know but you know before
[27:40] moses could get to that point
[27:42] he had an 80-year training process he
[27:45] had a point to where he got to the
[27:46] voices
[27:47] lord i can't speak i can't do nothing
[27:50] i am a miserable failure everything i've
[27:54] ever done
[27:54] look at me i'm old i'm worn out
[27:58] finally moses finally it took forever
[28:02] but i
[28:02] got you where i want you just now
[28:05] finally got you where i want you
[28:07] now you'll just do what i want you to do
[28:11] nothing more nothing less you'll just do
[28:15] what i want you to do
[28:17] right you won't turn to the right you
[28:19] won't turn to the left
[28:21] you don't have any more will you're not
[28:24] trying to prove anything to anybody else
[28:27] you have one purpose one desire that's
[28:30] just to do what i've asked you to do
[28:32] i may cause you to stand there and be
[28:34] ridiculed and made fun of and abased
[28:36] before all men
[28:37] but if that's what i want you to do
[28:38] moses you'll do it now
[28:40] you wouldn't do it before there was just
[28:42] too much of moses there
[28:44] but you'll do it now because now i
[28:46] finally got you or i can use you
[28:48] so before he could you know call for
[28:50] those
[28:51] the party in the red sea and any of
[28:53] those things he had a process to go
[28:54] through
[28:55] you know jacob had before he could tell
[28:57] that son to stand still he had a process
[28:59] he had to go through
[29:01] he had to be sure that he would only do
[29:03] what the word said do
[29:05] he was told to go around the city one
[29:06] time in one day you go around the city
[29:08] one time in one day
[29:09] two on the second day two in the second
[29:11] day seven on the seventh day seventh on
[29:13] the seventh day you do exactly what the
[29:15] word tells you
[29:16] you hold your peace and then when i tell
[29:18] you to scream out you scream out
[29:20] don't do nothing until i tell you what
[29:23] to do
[29:24] sometimes gonna tell you to move
[29:25] sometimes i'm going to tell you to stop
[29:27] but you have to follow the very whisper
[29:29] of my command
[29:31] you know god likes to test his children
[29:33] just to see how they're going to respond
[29:35] it's not always lemmy adam
[29:39] i think you're ready for it but he just
[29:41] says
[29:42] wait for my nod then i'll tell you to go
[29:45] right
[29:46] and it's counter to a personal man type
[29:50] of a personality but i think it's very
[29:52] complementary
[29:53] to the nature of jesus christ in the
[29:55] believer
[29:57] and so as i'm listening to why christ
[30:00] speak i
[30:00] i walked out i was just praying just
[30:02] talking the lord and i walked into my
[30:04] office and i picked up a
[30:06] all my oh my i had about a 150 sermons
[30:09] and just sitting there i just reached in
[30:10] i just grabbed one
[30:11] i was going to read something before i
[30:12] go to bed you know so i
[30:14] i look i go oh that's a pretty good one
[30:16] christ the mystery of god revealed you
[30:18] know that's a pretty good thing to read
[30:19] before we go to bed right
[30:21] and i just opened it up and i opened it
[30:23] up to this page
[30:26] and i say i looked at this first part
[30:29] mind if i just read it okay with this we
[30:32] got nowhere to go right
[30:34] no so it says this is god's great
[30:37] mystery of love expressed
[30:39] that god and man became one see the
[30:42] whole thing is god in man one
[30:44] god and man was one there and god and
[30:46] man won here
[30:48] see what is it being filled with his
[30:50] spirit
[30:51] and him having the preeminences that
[30:54] was god's achievement that's god's
[30:57] purpose
[30:58] to do that that he might be in christ
[31:02] in christ in us and all of us together
[31:05] one the holy spirit the same thing
[31:07] it revealed it to christ reveals it here
[31:10] the supernatural
[31:11] creative power mind if i keep reading
[31:16] remember think of it that people born of
[31:19] his spirit
[31:20] in a day like this in this great
[31:22] denominational age that we live
[31:24] and the living god takes his living word
[31:28] and vindicates it personally this life
[31:31] that's in the word the germ that's in
[31:34] that seed
[31:35] and the word is the seed that the sower
[31:37] went forth
[31:38] and to sow and the life is christ
[31:41] in the word personally in you
[31:44] vindicating
[31:45] something that you cannot do
[31:49] proving himself that it's not you
[31:52] it's him and you've become one
[31:55] a love slave to him to be his bride
[31:59] so as you can tell i'm getting excited
[32:01] as i'm reading this and these are the
[32:02] thoughts in my mind
[32:04] so let's just keep reading his presence
[32:06] in the individual with a personal
[32:08] vindication of himself
[32:09] expressing himself the living word
[32:12] that's promised for the day expressing
[32:14] itself through you
[32:16] a vindication of the great revelation of
[32:18] god
[32:19] look only in an individual never
[32:22] in a group an individual not in a group
[32:26] his identification is with an individual
[32:30] it's not a group it's a personal
[32:33] vindication
[32:34] of a pregnant child of god filled with
[32:37] the holy ghost
[32:38] so surrendered to god that he don't care
[32:41] about anything else the holy spirit
[32:44] living its life pulsating through him
[32:47] showing the personal
[32:49] vindication of the word itself
[32:52] being expressed to the people to the
[32:55] world
[32:57] so then i flip the page and i look at
[32:59] the top and i had written down
[33:01] the bride stand a few years ago
[33:06] just the last time i wrote it down but
[33:07] this is the exact same thing i wrote
[33:09] down on sunday
[33:11] built to stand and i wrote down the
[33:13] bride stand so let's see what is the
[33:14] bride stand
[33:16] it's an individual and one person and
[33:19] all hell
[33:20] is against this teaching all
[33:23] hell is against this truth but
[33:26] it is the truth so you're telling me the
[33:30] the devil has one major objective
[33:34] keeping the individual from an
[33:37] individual revelation of his position
[33:41] in christ and his ability to stand on
[33:43] the word
[33:44] even if nobody else stands
[33:47] so i wonder maybe the separation from
[33:50] our brethren maybe the isolation from
[33:53] the ability to lean upon the strength of
[33:56] the group
[33:57] might be serving the great purpose of
[33:59] god and backfiring on the devil
[34:01] he might be thinking if i can keep him
[34:03] separated if i can keep them frustrated
[34:06] if i can keep them in such a condition
[34:08] where they cannot come together
[34:10] they cannot hear from the word of god
[34:12] being preached maybe
[34:13] this will be the thing that separates
[34:16] them and breaks them up and loosens them
[34:18] i wonder if it'll backfire i'm getting
[34:21] text messages from brothers overseeing
[34:23] saying brother this was a blessing
[34:25] i'm not as busy i'm home with my family
[34:28] my kids you know what we're doing we're
[34:29] feeding on the word
[34:31] day and night wow
[34:34] this could be a good thing i just choose
[34:36] to believe that all things work together
[34:38] for the good to them that love the lord
[34:40] right no matter what it looks like it's
[34:42] serving his purpose
[34:44] he knows what he's doing and i think he
[34:47] wants more than anything
[34:48] to know for you to know that you can
[34:50] stand with him alone
[34:52] on that word just alone
[34:55] i don't need the strength of the pastor
[34:57] i don't need the group
[34:59] i don't need the families i have him
[35:02] i've got the word he's personally
[35:04] revealed himself to me
[35:06] i think god likes to break up tradition
[35:08] i think he likes to break up routine
[35:10] i really really really do i think he
[35:12] likes to discomfort her
[35:14] i think he's got a purpose in it
[35:19] so he says not them but him as you see
[35:23] to an individual not a group always an
[35:25] individual
[35:26] hells all against it but his mystery
[35:30] is only revealed to his beloved bride
[35:32] that's the only one
[35:33] that could see it but all the mystery is
[35:36] revealed only as he has promised
[35:39] to his bride hell is against this truth
[35:42] the revelation of this mystery but the
[35:45] bride is standing on it
[35:46] for that's her stand why do you hunger
[35:50] church
[35:50] why do you thirst it's the father trying
[35:53] to reveal his hidden secret to you
[35:56] but you let so many things get it out of
[35:59] you
[35:59] you let your job you let your wife
[36:03] you let your husband you let your
[36:05] children you let the cares
[36:07] of the world you let some pastor you let
[36:10] somebody else
[36:12] get it out of you when you know that way
[36:14] down in your heart that you're
[36:16] thirsting and you're hungry it's god
[36:18] trying to reveal it to you
[36:20] see the revelation for the last day is
[36:23] here
[36:24] wow so maybe
[36:28] just maybe god is creating a set of
[36:31] circumstances allowing the devil
[36:33] to do whatever he wants to do but it's
[36:36] just setting up the circumstances
[36:38] to embolden the bride like she's never
[36:40] been emboldened before
[36:42] to bring her in a greater consecrated
[36:44] state that she realizes
[36:45] i can do nothing without him i can't do
[36:48] nothing without him
[36:50] god likes to break routines just so you
[36:51] can realize that sometimes
[36:54] and i'd like you to turn to psalms 1.
[37:06] psalms 1 1
[37:12] says blessed is the man that walketh not
[37:16] in the counsel of the ungodly
[37:18] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[37:20] sitteth
[37:21] in the seat of the scornful but his
[37:23] delight is in the law of the lord
[37:25] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[37:28] night
[37:29] and he shall be then say they
[37:32] them group large group he said and he
[37:36] shall be like a tree planted by the
[37:39] rivers
[37:39] of water that bringeth forth his fruit
[37:42] in his season his leaf
[37:46] also will not wither and whatsoever he
[37:48] doeth
[37:49] shall prosper and the interesting thing
[37:51] about here
[37:52] it really doesn't matter if the rain
[37:54] stops raining
[37:55] this tree is connected to the river and
[37:57] the power source from the very depths
[37:59] of its roots and you can't see those
[38:02] roots
[38:03] you can't see anything a man could be
[38:05] standing right by the tree and says it
[38:07] hasn't rained for weeks
[38:08] but this tree keeps getting bigger
[38:11] wonder why
[38:12] because there's something underneath
[38:14] there's something hitting there's
[38:15] something not public
[38:17] it's not a public show there's
[38:19] something's hidden
[38:20] down underneath nobody can see it
[38:23] there's no big
[38:23] uproar about it what's going on i can't
[38:26] believe this tree is flourishing
[38:28] how is it flourishing they're
[38:30] disconnected they're discombobulated
[38:32] i've got them fractured i've got them
[38:34] upset how are they blossoming like a
[38:36] rose
[38:37] how are they growing in strength because
[38:39] they connected
[38:40] they connected to that life source and
[38:43] they know that they as long as they just
[38:45] keep stay connected and keep drawing
[38:47] in from that resource right there
[38:49] everything they have need of
[38:50] is provided for them and i taught this
[38:53] to my girls i
[38:54] got a big piece of paper out did a
[38:56] family devotion the other night and i
[38:57] just drew this great big tree
[38:59] connected to this water source and i was
[39:01] talking to him my girls and
[39:03] i brought up brother chad's sermon they
[39:04] see these little seeds here honey
[39:06] i said these little seeds you know
[39:07] sometimes we get upset at humanity but
[39:09] humanity serves god's purpose too
[39:11] you know i had to be god planted his
[39:13] little germ of life into the betting
[39:15] ground of this humanity right here
[39:17] you know why because he knows that
[39:18] humanity will die under the right
[39:20] conditions
[39:22] that little seed will die under the
[39:23] right conditions
[39:25] it'll break apart and then you know
[39:27] he'll use humanity he'll use your
[39:29] brothers and sisters
[39:30] sometimes right the bible says heresies
[39:33] must deeds become so that they that are
[39:35] approved among you
[39:36] may be made manifested so god allows
[39:38] little problems allows a wife allows a
[39:40] husband allows a brother allows a pastor
[39:42] to say something to hurt you sometimes
[39:45] just to check you just to shake you up
[39:47] right
[39:48] sometimes you need a little spanking you
[39:50] need a little shock to your system to
[39:52] get you to wake up to something
[39:53] brother jeremy i think you told me years
[39:55] ago an apple tree if it's not bringing
[39:56] forth apples by the laundry antonia you
[39:58] take a stick and you beat the tree
[40:00] that makes no sense to me but apparently
[40:03] it works
[40:04] if you hit that tree with a stick it
[40:06] does something to shock its system
[40:09] and it comes and starts bringing forth
[40:11] life i did know this because i
[40:13] used to do some planning and stuff like
[40:16] that and
[40:16] if you have a root bound plant you have
[40:18] to cut up its roots
[40:20] you have to almost traumatize the thing
[40:22] so that it goes into action and
[40:24] sends forth those roots down deep and
[40:26] takes a grip of the soil
[40:27] so that it can live you have to do
[40:29] something to shock it because it's not
[40:31] producing
[40:32] and sometimes god has to do something to
[40:34] the bride to shock her system
[40:36] to wake her up to bring forth the fruit
[40:38] that she's supposed to
[40:40] in his season but you're never going to
[40:42] do it if you
[40:43] just constantly are relying upon the
[40:46] rain to fall upon you
[40:47] the ministry to spay everything you need
[40:49] it to be said to the
[40:50] brothers and the sisters to come to you
[40:52] and lift you up when you're down
[40:54] you have a source god's in our midst
[40:58] he proves himself over and over and time
[41:00] and time again and yet you want to be
[41:02] discouraged
[41:03] you want to be upset your brother hasn't
[41:05] lifted you up nobody's calling you
[41:07] nobody's checking in on you what is that
[41:09] to you
[41:11] you've got a connection to the river of
[41:13] life we're not
[41:14] shocked who we're not dismayed we're not
[41:17] a people dismayed
[41:18] we know the hour in which we're living
[41:20] we know where he's at he's in our
[41:21] presence he's in our midst
[41:23] we have everything we have need of not
[41:25] to survive but to
[41:26] thrive under any condition that this
[41:28] world comes into
[41:30] i don't i can't put up with anything
[41:32] else i you'd be upset you'd be
[41:34] frustrated you get down i'm sorry i have
[41:36] nothing to be frustrated i have nothing
[41:38] to get down about
[41:39] god is so creating the environment you
[41:41] know god created a certain virus just
[41:43] reminds me brother man what you said
[41:44] there
[41:45] about jesus the scene had to be set
[41:49] god had to get everything just into a
[41:52] right condition
[41:53] so that his masterpiece could go on
[41:55] display everything that
[41:57] the political system the ecumenical
[41:59] system the people you think about it one
[42:01] day before
[42:02] they have palms in their hands saying
[42:03] hosanna hosanna
[42:05] we bless you god i mean they're excited
[42:07] the very next day they're saying they're
[42:09] crying out for his blood
[42:11] let his blood be upon us crucify him
[42:14] how could the people switch that quick
[42:17] what happened to them what spirit swept
[42:20] over the people where one day they
[42:21] didn't have a problem maybe they didn't
[42:22] know that he was hosanna but they didn't
[42:24] have a problem with him yeah a little
[42:25] bit strange right you know but we got no
[42:27] issue with those people they're in the
[42:29] word yeah they're a little
[42:30] strange they've got some strange beliefs
[42:31] you know just like jesus yeah i had some
[42:33] training but we don't understand what's
[42:34] going on right they just left him alone
[42:36] but boy when the system changed just a
[42:38] little bit
[42:39] you get things in a little bit of funny
[42:41] condition you start to bring about a
[42:42] fear in the people you don't know what
[42:44] the government system is going to do
[42:46] i'll tell you what they'll turn really
[42:47] really quick and if anything these
[42:49] things that are happening are just
[42:51] setting the stage for a b
[42:52] system to have total authoritative
[42:54] control over the entire world
[42:55] but what is that to us what is that to
[42:58] us we don't care
[43:00] it's got to be in those conditions god's
[43:03] masterpiece is going to be put on
[43:04] display again
[43:05] he's got a bride that he's going to say
[43:08] look here she is
[43:09] so simple so humble not going to be
[43:12] sometimes the things we want it to be
[43:14] i really sometimes want to be out bring
[43:16] me the sick
[43:18] let's go to the hospital you know every
[43:20] one of you feel like that sometimes
[43:22] you're like
[43:23] take me to the hospital i'm ready clear
[43:24] them out i got the word i know who i am
[43:26] i know my position
[43:28] i believe it have confidence in it and
[43:30] he sometimes he just
[43:31] stand still be quiet
[43:34] jesus walked by all those men at the
[43:36] pool of bethesda to
[43:37] one man he was in complete obedience to
[43:41] one
[43:43] his heavenly father he only did those
[43:46] things that he was shown to do
[43:48] and he did nothing more that's a real
[43:51] test for the bride
[43:53] when you have full power full authority
[43:55] you could do whatever you need to do
[43:57] there he was the fullness of the godhead
[43:59] bodily dwelling in one
[44:01] form spit on ripping his beard
[44:05] out of his face mocking him and
[44:08] ridiculing him
[44:09] he's there to help them to save them the
[44:11] very one he's there to help and to save
[44:13] they're beating him spitting in his face
[44:17] and he's so high that heaven has to look
[44:19] up to see him
[44:20] holy sh seraphins and cherubians
[44:23] screaming holy holy in his presence
[44:26] and here you are beating him and you
[44:28] know what the amazing thing was
[44:30] he did nothing
[44:33] he did nothing he had a right to do it
[44:36] he had the ability to do it he could
[44:38] have done it
[44:39] but he didn't have the go-ahead to do it
[44:42] it would have broken
[44:43] the whole plan of god so sometimes
[44:47] i honestly believe god will put the
[44:48] bride into position
[44:50] she could change the scene in a
[44:51] heartbeat
[44:53] she could really flip this thing upside
[44:55] down but she won't have permission to do
[44:57] it
[44:59] she's going to be ready to move and he's
[45:00] going to be saying stand down
[45:02] just stand still just be quiet
[45:06] i'm serving my great purpose i think god
[45:09] likes to do that with his people
[45:12] brother branham said well i want to read
[45:15] this first though
[45:16] the proverb says that he that is slow to
[45:19] anger
[45:20] is better than the mighty and he that
[45:21] ruleth his spirit than he that taketh
[45:24] the city
[45:25] yeah god's great achievement is you
[45:29] the devil's not the problem the devil is
[45:32] not the
[45:33] the the major achievement here right no
[45:36] you're the major achievement
[45:38] yeah you're the one you're the one that
[45:40] he's he's working
[45:41] he's constantly he's bringing trial and
[45:44] tribulation difficulty and they all have
[45:46] custom-made trials just made for you
[45:48] but he's working to get you surrendered
[45:50] to him get you into that complete
[45:52] submitted state
[45:53] no matter what i bring you you stand
[45:56] still because you've been connected with
[45:57] me nothing shakes you
[45:59] right nothing so brother banham said
[46:01] this in perfect strength through perfect
[46:03] weakness
[46:04] god sent us a prophet that will take the
[46:06] word of god
[46:07] that would will not take something else
[46:11] but would but just get empty vessels
[46:14] if god can just get them empty vessels
[46:17] and then take the word of god
[46:19] and pour it into that person not say oh
[46:22] i shook when i received it oh i spoke in
[46:24] tongues when i received oh i danced in
[46:26] the spirit forget it
[46:27] forget it just stay there until it comes
[46:30] till that vessel is so full that's it
[46:33] that's the way you do it yes sir the
[46:36] simplicity of it
[46:37] the vessels were all filled up how oh
[46:40] how we could stay on that
[46:42] isaiah 53 says he was oppressed he was
[46:44] afflicted
[46:45] and yet he opened not his mouth he was
[46:48] brought
[46:48] as a lamb to the slaughter and as a
[46:50] sheep before her shears
[46:52] is dumb so he opened not his mouth he
[46:56] was taken from prison and from
[46:58] judgment and who shall declare his
[47:00] generation
[47:02] for he was cut off from the land of the
[47:03] living and from the transgression of my
[47:05] people
[47:06] he was stricken the greatest of all
[47:08] beaten
[47:09] stricken bruised and he doesn't do
[47:12] anything and i'm standing before another
[47:15] royal seed
[47:17] a royal priesthood that has more power
[47:20] than she thinks
[47:22] she really does my god is
[47:25] also conditioning her to only respond
[47:28] and move when he says move
[47:30] see that's a great paradox full power
[47:33] and full ability but completely
[47:35] under submission complete under control
[47:39] that's a good father that's a heavenly
[47:41] father that's he's training us the
[47:43] proper way
[47:44] right brother bam says this
[47:47] says jesus with his head back walking on
[47:50] and the priest screaming at him making
[47:52] fun of him others were crying hosanna
[47:54] but did you notice
[47:55] whole burden of the whole world rested
[47:57] upon him
[47:58] calvary the dark hours of gethsethme was
[48:01] laying before him
[48:03] oh has he went he never noticed their
[48:05] scoffing
[48:06] you know when someone says something
[48:08] evil about you
[48:09] and you want to take it up and get angry
[48:11] about it
[48:12] that just shows that you haven't went
[48:14] quite deep enough yet with god
[48:16] big men don't do those things that's
[48:19] what made
[48:20] him god to me he was big
[48:23] he didn't have to notice their little
[48:25] scoffings
[48:26] he had a purpose he had a work to do
[48:30] and that was to fulfill what god had
[48:32] sent him to do
[48:33] and he was determined to do it he didn't
[48:36] care
[48:36] what anyone said
[48:40] and the lord just dropped it on my heart
[48:41] so i want to say this
[48:43] the last time i ministered i said
[48:44] something wrong and it just now hit me
[48:47] by the chad all right with it but i feel
[48:48] i have to
[48:50] so if you remember we were talking about
[48:51] those eagles and that eagle and that
[48:53] squirrel
[48:54] and that uh that little chatter chatter
[48:56] chatter of this girl
[48:57] not that anything was wrong with that it
[48:59] was the right thought there
[49:01] but i was saying you know that eagle got
[49:03] he just got frustrated with that
[49:04] squirrel the chatter chatter chatter
[49:06] days of miracles over chatter chatter
[49:08] chair denying the present tense reality
[49:10] of god
[49:10] right finally that ego just gets the
[49:12] points i'm just sick and tired of it
[49:14] right
[49:16] and that's true god allowed that
[49:18] squirrel to be there
[49:19] god allows those squirrels to be in our
[49:20] midst in this hour but i had said
[49:22] something i said i hope you can read
[49:24] between the lines
[49:26] and it's not that that wasn't right but
[49:27] i said it with the wrong motive and
[49:28] objective
[49:29] and i wanted to apologize that just it
[49:31] just hit me again and i
[49:32] had told the lord if i had the
[49:34] opportunity i'd make that right before
[49:35] the people and i told brother chad that
[49:37] wasn't right
[49:37] i shouldn't have said that as soon as i
[49:39] said i grieved him i knew i grieved him
[49:40] right then it just
[49:41] made me sick to my stomach but i think
[49:43] god is very interested in our motive and
[49:45] our objectives and these hours
[49:47] i really think that god is going to
[49:49] allow many squirrels
[49:51] and you know what they're serving their
[49:53] purpose i'm not going to be upset
[49:55] i'm not going to ridicule i'm not going
[49:57] to make fun of i'm not going to do
[49:58] anything
[49:59] they're serving their purpose and really
[50:02] who are we to say they're wrong
[50:07] if you think about it they may be wrong
[50:11] but they may be right they may be
[50:14] serving his purpose which makes them
[50:16] right
[50:17] you know pharaoh served his purpose
[50:20] pharaoh wasn't right
[50:21] but pharaoh served god's purpose and god
[50:24] continually hardened his heart
[50:27] because god was serving because god had
[50:29] a great plan
[50:30] and pharaoh had to serve his purpose and
[50:33] that's what i i
[50:34] i wanted to apologize for that and i
[50:35] hope you that you understand that i i
[50:38] i don't want to ever say anything with a
[50:40] wrong motive and objective and something
[50:42] bothers
[50:43] him and i need to make that right so
[50:46] i can make mistakes um we all can
[50:50] and i trust that god will correct us
[50:51] when we're wrong and we'll have we'll be
[50:54] humble enough to say lord that's right
[50:56] i i'm not here to glory glory in
[50:58] anything
[50:59] there's nothing good about me anyhow
[51:01] you're the only good one among us
[51:04] and i think sometimes god will maybe
[51:06] allow a minister to make mistakes like
[51:07] that
[51:08] sometimes mess up really bad just so
[51:11] god doesn't have to share his glory with
[51:13] anybody
[51:14] and you know he the littler we can get
[51:17] the bigger he can get in us i think
[51:19] brother banham said
[51:20] he's only as big as as you allow him to
[51:23] be
[51:23] maybe i'm getting that wrong as or as
[51:25] little as you can become that's how big
[51:26] he can be in you
[51:28] so i want to make sure that we do those
[51:30] things so that was on my mind i'll get
[51:31] that off there
[51:32] and just move brother branham also says
[51:34] here he says now
[51:36] what was he yesterday now if he was
[51:39] if he was a rich man yesterday he'd be a
[51:42] great rich man today
[51:44] but when he come yesterday we find out
[51:46] that he didn't even have a place to come
[51:48] lay his head
[51:49] that's right the birds all have nests
[51:51] and the foxes have dens
[51:53] but he didn't even have a place to lay
[51:55] his head he had
[51:57] he came to the world but he had to
[51:59] borrow a womb to be born in
[52:01] they had no cradle for him to even be
[52:02] laid in so they laid him in a box of
[52:04] straw
[52:05] when he died he was nailed to a roman
[52:07] tree under capital punishment
[52:09] he had no he had one robe put on
[52:12] it it had been made for him woven
[52:14] throughout with one scene
[52:16] without a scene he had to borrow a grave
[52:19] even to be buried in
[52:21] so there's none of us that that was that
[52:23] bad off
[52:24] he come to show what god was
[52:27] anything that's high and haughty isn't
[52:30] god
[52:30] god is low and humble that's what made
[52:33] him god
[52:34] see something that comes low not
[52:37] them that goes high so god doesn't dwell
[52:41] in ark or hierarchies and things
[52:44] he dwells in humility and the way up
[52:47] is to humble yourself and you'll be
[52:49] exalted
[52:50] exalt yourself and you'll be humbled
[52:53] that's right
[52:54] see god knows how to do it you have to
[52:56] remember
[52:57] humble yourself before god don't try to
[52:59] think your own thoughts
[53:01] just think his thoughts because the
[53:03] whole christian armor
[53:05] is unseen a christian doesn't look at
[53:07] what he can see with the natural
[53:09] now you look the only way you can be a
[53:12] christian
[53:13] you've got to believe god you you can't
[53:16] see
[53:16] now look watch there the whole christian
[53:18] armor is love joy faith long suffering
[53:21] patience meekness gentleness holy spirit
[53:23] see
[53:24] and all of those things are the unseen
[53:26] things they're unseen
[53:28] but those things that are unseen are the
[53:30] only reality
[53:32] it's the unseen things
[53:36] and i hope it's okay i'll just keep
[53:37] reading these i just i get encouraged by
[53:39] them
[53:40] brother branham also says here and why
[53:42] i'm against organized religion
[53:44] that's the way god does the church he
[53:47] beats every creed every denomination
[53:49] and every man-made dogma until he sees
[53:52] his own
[53:53] life reflecting if i do not the works of
[53:57] my father then believe me not
[53:59] see if what is its purpose to the church
[54:03] the life that was in christ isn't
[54:05] reflecting in you
[54:06] don't you stand still if you don't got
[54:09] the patience
[54:10] or the virtue and all of those things
[54:12] and the temperance and the things and
[54:14] the godliness and the brotherly kindness
[54:16] and all those things that's required of
[54:17] you
[54:18] no matter what you've done and no matter
[54:19] how much you've shouted
[54:21] and how many churches you've joined
[54:25] how many feathers you've pinned onto
[54:27] yourself don't do it
[54:28] wait until that genuinely from your
[54:31] heart you can forgive
[54:33] till in your heart you have such a
[54:34] brotherly kindness
[54:36] that no matter if they were to pull a
[54:38] handful of the beard from your side
[54:40] you could turn the cheek to the other
[54:42] side in sweetness
[54:43] with all of those virtues no matter what
[54:46] they should say about you
[54:48] i think god wants his bride in that kind
[54:51] of a condition
[54:52] she's bone of his bone life of his life
[54:55] power of his power
[54:56] spirit of his spirit right god is going
[54:59] to put his bride in a position you can
[55:01] rip this side of my cheek out
[55:03] and if you want to you can rip this side
[55:04] out you can
[55:06] say whatever you want and i'll say god
[55:08] bless you
[55:10] lord help you i ain't gonna say nothing
[55:13] i'll just
[55:14] be quiet that's what he wants to see
[55:17] i will admit i'm not quite there let's
[55:20] just be honest
[55:21] but that's what i desire and only he can
[55:25] change my desires
[55:26] and i'm thankful i'm hungering for it
[55:28] and i'm thirsting for it
[55:30] and he said he gave me a promise if you
[55:32] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[55:34] you'll be filled i want that righteous
[55:37] life of jesus christ so manifesting in
[55:39] me you could crucify me
[55:40] and i'll only try to do what i can to
[55:42] help you along the way
[55:44] that's the desire i got you know that's
[55:46] a different kind of strength
[55:48] that's a strength that is opposite of
[55:50] what the world calls strong
[55:52] but a real strength is to be able to
[55:55] harness your own
[55:56] uh will your own abilities
[55:59] and say lord not my will be done thy
[56:02] will be done
[56:03] amen the bible says here as many ours
[56:07] are the
[56:08] oh for as many as are led by the spirit
[56:10] of god they are the sons of god
[56:12] for we have not received a spirit of
[56:14] bondage unto fear but we've received the
[56:16] spirit of adoption whereby we are crying
[56:18] out abba father
[56:19] the spirit itself is bearing witness
[56:21] with our spirit that we are the children
[56:22] of god
[56:23] and if children then heirs and heirs of
[56:26] god and join heirs with christ
[56:28] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[56:31] may be also glorified together
[56:33] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[56:35] present time are not worthy to be
[56:36] compared with the glory that shall be
[56:38] revealed in us so there's no glory to be
[56:42] revealed in us
[56:43] outside of a certain aspect of suffering
[56:45] that must go along with it
[56:47] they kind of go part and parcel if you
[56:49] want to be glorified with him you have
[56:50] to suffer with him
[56:52] right and there's a plenty of suffering
[56:54] i think to come
[56:55] as she continues to stand on his word to
[56:57] only do what he says to do when she says
[56:59] to do it
[57:00] when he says to do it right
[57:03] and i wanted to look at this you know
[57:07] remember the story of david and he's a
[57:09] rejected king
[57:11] and he's leaving the city and there's a
[57:14] man there to spit upon him along the way
[57:17] yeah let me just read it but yet look at
[57:20] david
[57:20] when he was going out he was exiled from
[57:22] his own people rejected king his own
[57:24] daughter had been ravaged by his by by
[57:26] her brother
[57:27] and the brothers all killed him and
[57:28] there he was absalon raised up separated
[57:31] the army causing a revolution and david
[57:32] his own father
[57:34] was was excommunicated see taken away
[57:36] rejected by his own people
[57:38] going out of the city there was this
[57:41] little crippled up fella dragging along
[57:44] uh there making fun of him and spitting
[57:46] at him and a guard pulled his sword and
[57:47] said
[57:48] i'll let the dog that dog's head stay on
[57:50] him spitting on my king
[57:52] david said you let him alone god told
[57:55] him to do it
[57:57] and you remember also brother branham
[57:58] was in a situation like that as well
[58:00] the tax collectors were bothering him
[58:02] constantly constantly even got the
[58:04] prophet of god to lie to him
[58:05] right he had to make that confession
[58:07] make that right before the people and
[58:08] before his wife
[58:09] got him so wound up and brother vail and
[58:12] was kind of talked to him one day and i
[58:14] think all the ministers kind of get one
[58:15] i said brother man how do you act like
[58:16] that
[58:17] you know if it was kind of me i'd i'd
[58:18] put them in their place and smart man
[58:20] like that brother bob said he could
[58:21] probably do it too
[58:22] he said but you know maybe just let him
[58:24] alone maybe god's telling him to do that
[58:26] thing
[58:27] you know and so many times i think that
[58:29] there's plenty of obstacles and there's
[58:31] many opposition there may be many that
[58:33] make fun of
[58:34] but i think maybe god would allow it and
[58:36] maybe it's not a time to draw a sword
[58:38] it's not the time to fight it's time to
[58:40] be able to have
[58:41] such a yielded spirit to his will that
[58:44] you can just stand
[58:46] say lord i know who i am i know where
[58:49] i'm standing
[58:50] and i know you're with me i don't fight
[58:52] back
[58:53] yeah it's an interesting thing
[58:56] so to take the bride taking a stand in
[58:59] this hour
[59:00] i'm sorry to disappoint you brothers i
[59:03] think everybody is there
[59:04] i'm ready to take my stand government's
[59:06] shutting down gonna shut us all down i'm
[59:08] ready take my stam ready go into action
[59:09] i'm ready to fight
[59:11] by taking your stand you may say stand
[59:13] still just be quiet stand
[59:15] silent remember this is his purpose and
[59:17] his will
[59:19] i think it kind of may be fitting stand
[59:21] still and see the salvation of our god
[59:23] god may create the circumstance look
[59:25] impossible and no doubt he will
[59:28] and he's going to say stand still watch
[59:30] what i'm going to do for her
[59:32] he's waiting to show himself mighty on
[59:34] his on our behalf
[59:36] our only responsibility is to not waver
[59:38] at that ability
[59:39] is to believe it trust it ready for it
[59:42] remember
[59:43] the man the the husband defends the wife
[59:45] the wife doesn't need to defend him
[59:48] right you know someone's trying to break
[59:51] in my house and my wife's like step back
[59:52] kyle i got him
[59:54] but we got problems we got some issues
[59:58] no i got this you know we'd have some
[1:00:01] issues
[1:00:02] i think god's the same way yeah right
[1:00:05] honey
[1:00:05] i got this i'm going to create a bunch
[1:00:07] of circumstances because i want to show
[1:00:09] my strength to you honey
[1:00:10] you just stand still be quiet you just
[1:00:13] trust me
[1:00:14] you have confidence in me you love me
[1:00:15] right yeah just watch what i'm going to
[1:00:17] do next
[1:00:17] it's going to get good will you stand
[1:00:19] with me i'm sorry very rambling
[1:00:22] and i told you i'm going to share the
[1:00:23] thought and then i'm done
[1:00:25] so musicians if you could come
[1:00:33] so as bad as we all may want hey it's
[1:00:35] time for why christ speak
[1:00:37] and i do believe those times come i'm
[1:00:39] not taking away from those things but i
[1:00:42] think we have to be
[1:00:43] led of the spirit to know when to be
[1:00:45] quiet and when to speak
[1:00:47] when to fight when to not when to rend
[1:00:51] when to sew up when to embrace and when
[1:00:54] not to it's a it's a time where we
[1:00:57] really need holy ghost leadership like
[1:00:59] we've never done before
[1:01:00] and i think we need to take every
[1:01:02] opportunity that god has given us in
[1:01:03] these
[1:01:04] times like this to really connect to
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] living water that water that never runs
[1:01:10] dry
[1:01:11] that will never fail you that promise
[1:01:13] would always be with you
[1:01:15] even in you to the end of the world this
[1:01:17] is a blessed opportunity that god has
[1:01:19] given us
[1:01:20] to mold us to shape us to mature us
[1:01:24] to where we're not relying upon maybe
[1:01:25] the pastor we don't have access to him
[1:01:27] as much
[1:01:28] maybe the deacons maybe the sisters
[1:01:31] can't really talk to the other sisters
[1:01:32] and communicate
[1:01:33] they can talk to their husbands now like
[1:01:35] maybe they should have been from the
[1:01:36] beginning sorry
[1:01:40] i don't see any sisters so i could say
[1:01:41] that but i know i'll pay a price for
[1:01:43] that
[1:01:45] sorry but you know what i mean sometimes
[1:01:47] we lean too much on
[1:01:49] each other and i don't think that
[1:01:51] pleases god i really don't believe that
[1:01:53] that place is our lord
[1:01:54] i think we need to be conscientious of
[1:01:56] what he's trying to achieve in each of
[1:01:57] us
[1:01:58] remember god and man won god and man
[1:02:02] one yeah and say god and two men
[1:02:06] three just one brother you got a song

[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:02] i'm gonna read one more as you're coming
[1:08:05] since you waited
[1:08:08] i just saw it in why christ speak
[1:08:13] notice how beautiful oh i love this you
[1:08:16] know
[1:08:16] finally pharaoh got to the point he said
[1:08:18] get out of here
[1:08:20] god just plagued him with the voice of
[1:08:23] moses
[1:08:24] he struck everything he done everything
[1:08:26] there was that he needed to do
[1:08:28] he stopped the sun or he put the sun
[1:08:30] down in the middle of the day
[1:08:31] he done everything else he blackened the
[1:08:34] days he brought forth the frogs the
[1:08:35] fleas the lice and everything the smoke
[1:08:37] the fire
[1:08:39] death of families and everything else he
[1:08:40] done everything until finally said
[1:08:42] pharaoh
[1:08:43] pharaoh had to say you get out of here
[1:08:45] take it all
[1:08:46] and go oh my praise god i'm so glad that
[1:08:51] a man can
[1:08:52] can so completely serve god till he
[1:08:56] the devil don't know what to do with him
[1:08:59] that's right just obey god so
[1:09:02] completely to the devil says oh my
[1:09:05] get away i don't want to hear any of it
[1:09:08] anymore that's right just get away
[1:09:10] so completely surrendered
[1:09:13] that's my desire so completely chat
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:27] praise the lord you know god is
[1:09:30] stretching
[1:09:31] every one of us but in ways we didn't
[1:09:34] expect to be stretched
[1:09:37] you know we we we're accustomed to
[1:09:39] facing difficulty
[1:09:41] we've gotten accustomed to facing
[1:09:44] ridicule and scorn and hardship in
[1:09:46] different ways but we haven't become
[1:09:48] accustomed to inactivity
[1:09:51] to doing nothing that
[1:09:54] is a new kind of trial right
[1:09:58] you know shake off the restrictions
[1:10:01] shake off everything and
[1:10:02] who cares but god cares
[1:10:06] god's allowed it he's backed us into a
[1:10:08] corner and he wanted us backed into a
[1:10:10] corner
[1:10:11] i was talking to a brother the other day
[1:10:13] i said i feel like an
[1:10:14] eagle stuck in a keg
[1:10:18] we can fly we know we can fly we know
[1:10:20] there's nothing that can stop the word
[1:10:22] that's being expressed in the bride
[1:10:24] it's come in full power the full life of
[1:10:26] jesus christ is present with this word
[1:10:28] we know it and there's no doubt in our
[1:10:30] hearts about it that if god would drop
[1:10:32] in our hearts to speak we know we could
[1:10:34] speak
[1:10:34] and we know it would happen i feel like
[1:10:36] a k i feel like a an eagle that's got
[1:10:39] all its primary feathers
[1:10:40] fit the fly everything it can do and
[1:10:43] stuck in a cage and can go nowhere
[1:10:45] i was just expressing frustration the
[1:10:47] other day and i said the most
[1:10:48] frustrating thing is god put me in the
[1:10:50] cage
[1:10:53] that's the most frustrating part of it
[1:10:55] all is that god has put me in the cage
[1:10:58] because this is what he wants right now
[1:11:01] and and i'm trying not to be frustrated
[1:11:04] because it's god
[1:11:06] this message was perfect for me
[1:11:09] we want to obey every order of the chief
[1:11:11] captain
[1:11:13] we don't want to be a rogue army we
[1:11:15] don't want to be renegades creating more
[1:11:17] problems because
[1:11:18] all we want to do is fight amen i
[1:11:21] believe there's a fighting side to god
[1:11:24] i believe there's a nature of a warrior
[1:11:25] in god and i believe we've picked it up
[1:11:28] but there's also a lamb nature and a
[1:11:30] sacrificial nature too
[1:11:32] and there's both jesus could plat
[1:11:34] together a ropes and he could drive out
[1:11:36] the money chasers and flip over the
[1:11:38] tables and run about as a madman
[1:11:40] and when they were lashed on the back it
[1:11:42] really stung
[1:11:44] and the same one could be silent when he
[1:11:46] was accused
[1:11:48] there's two sides and sometimes god asks
[1:11:51] us to take one side and sometimes he
[1:11:52] asks us to take the other side
[1:11:54] and sometimes in our nature we want this
[1:11:56] side
[1:11:58] but sometimes he asks us to do something
[1:12:00] totally contrary to our nature
[1:12:02] so that he can have preeminence in full
[1:12:04] control
[1:12:06] i appreciated that so much sometimes
[1:12:08] he'll weaken the ministry
[1:12:11] amen why because he wants first place
[1:12:15] sometimes he'll weaken the physical
[1:12:17] church as i said physical church
[1:12:20] the physical church the physical church
[1:12:22] setting the dynamics and the power and
[1:12:25] and the move of the spirit with the
[1:12:26] congregation coming together
[1:12:28] and singing hundreds at a time amen in
[1:12:31] the pull on the word
[1:12:32] he'll weaken the physical church so he
[1:12:35] can have preeminence
[1:12:38] and when it's his time then let him do
[1:12:40] what he wants to do that's what i'm
[1:12:41] learning
[1:12:44] i think the quote says i may be
[1:12:46] misquoting but there's plenty of you who
[1:12:48] will correct me
[1:12:49] if i get it wrong power under control
[1:12:53] is fit to rule not
[1:12:57] we've got power there's no question
[1:13:00] fullness of the word with the fullness
[1:13:01] of the life here to back it up
[1:13:03] every claim but it's got to be power
[1:13:07] under control that's fit the rule
[1:13:11] and sometimes god will do the very thing
[1:13:13] we don't want him to do
[1:13:15] to prove whether or not he's got control
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] you know i love the lord
[1:13:26] even when he does things that i didn't
[1:13:28] want him to do
[1:13:29] i love him anyways even when he gets us
[1:13:32] in a situation that we don't want to be
[1:13:34] in
[1:13:35] and he tells you to sit still and you
[1:13:37] don't want to sit still
[1:13:39] and he tells you to submit and you don't
[1:13:40] want to submit
[1:13:42] i still love him anyways i say this has
[1:13:45] been a trial for me
[1:13:47] god has really been breaking me and
[1:13:49] breaking me
[1:13:51] because when god puts the heart of a
[1:13:53] shepherd into a man
[1:13:54] he has the heart of a shepherd you can't
[1:13:56] help it and that's something god does
[1:13:58] supernaturally it's not something
[1:14:00] you ask for it's not something i had
[1:14:02] before but when god called me to be a
[1:14:03] pastor he put in me the heart of a
[1:14:04] shepherd
[1:14:06] and all that i want to do the only thing
[1:14:08] i want to do is see all the sheep
[1:14:09] gathered together
[1:14:11] i want to know everyone's okay and i
[1:14:12] want to see every face and i
[1:14:14] and i want to have a connection while
[1:14:16] i'm preaching the word and connect with
[1:14:18] each one of the sheep
[1:14:18] that's all i want in the whole world if
[1:14:20] i could have if i could have my greatest
[1:14:22] desire right now would be have
[1:14:23] all the sheep together and i could see
[1:14:26] each one
[1:14:27] and god is breaking me friends because i
[1:14:30] can't help that that's my desire i can't
[1:14:32] help that's the greatest longing that i
[1:14:34] have right now for us all to be together
[1:14:36] but god is saying no and he's breaking
[1:14:39] me
[1:14:40] because i'm learning who the real
[1:14:41] shepherd is
[1:14:44] no matter what he's put in my heart he
[1:14:46] can put us in any situation he wants and
[1:14:48] tell us to be quiet
[1:14:50] and i just want to have enough love for
[1:14:52] him to say it's okay
[1:14:54] if it breaks me if i weep tears if i
[1:14:57] stay up in the night crying over it
[1:14:59] it's okay if that's what he wants that's
[1:15:02] what we want
[1:15:04] this is a real breaking time friends
[1:15:06] this is a real molding time
[1:15:08] it's a real proving time in ways we
[1:15:11] never dreamed
[1:15:13] i appreciate brother kyle being willing
[1:15:15] to bear a soul and apologize
[1:15:18] it was one small statement he made and
[1:15:21] it was a true statement
[1:15:23] he just knew it was in the wrong spirit
[1:15:25] it was in the wrong
[1:15:27] motive and god could correct him to me
[1:15:30] he's more endeared to me than he ever
[1:15:31] was before
[1:15:33] because he'd be willing to make that
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:36] say god make us right more than anything
[1:15:39] i want to be right
[1:15:41] i want to be pleasing to the lord if
[1:15:43] everybody else
[1:15:45] thinks i'm crazy as long as i can please
[1:15:47] him i'll be happy
[1:15:50] if everybody thinks i've done wrong and
[1:15:51] made the wrong choice that's okay as
[1:15:53] long as heath knows i made the right
[1:15:55] choice
[1:15:55] that's all that matters to me to be
[1:15:58] pleasing to him
[1:15:59] is the greatest desire of my life and
[1:16:01] it's becoming more so
[1:16:03] and friends it won't be too many more
[1:16:05] days that we will have
[1:16:06] zero regrets it won't be too long
[1:16:10] until there won't be one regret left
[1:16:13] they will know that it was all worth it
[1:16:15] when everything fades away and
[1:16:17] everything changes
[1:16:18] amen and and we see him in a translated
[1:16:21] body and we have a body like unto his
[1:16:23] and we see him as he is
[1:16:24] amen it'll all be worth it it'll all be
[1:16:27] worth it
[1:16:28] let's make that our goal that we strive
[1:16:30] towards
[1:16:32] god bless your friends let's all get
[1:16:34] stretched together
[1:16:36] let let all of our ideas about what the
[1:16:39] showdown's going to be like
[1:16:41] let it all get crushed amen every idea
[1:16:45] of what a trial is going to look like
[1:16:46] and how the bride will overcome hard
[1:16:48] trials just let him smash it right now
[1:16:52] because the way he wants his bride to
[1:16:54] overcome is to look like she's weak and
[1:16:56] feeble and incapable and
[1:16:58] unable of doing anything amen and uh
[1:17:01] all he's doing is roping the devil in
[1:17:05] getting him close for a kill because she
[1:17:08] looks incapable
[1:17:09] she looks uh you know flawed and failed
[1:17:13] and like she's not capable of producing
[1:17:15] anything
[1:17:16] but oh praise god if that's what my
[1:17:18] father wants to lure the devil a little
[1:17:20] closer then that's what he can have
[1:17:22] he could have my weakness he can have my
[1:17:25] inabilities
[1:17:27] he can have it all if that's what he
[1:17:29] wants to exploit
[1:17:30] is our inability then he can have it
[1:17:34] as long as he's pleased
[1:17:37] the bride stand oh
[1:17:40] inactivity is hard
[1:17:44] amen we're home more than we've ever
[1:17:46] been home before
[1:17:48] and when we were working we think oh
[1:17:49] it'd just be so good if i could just be
[1:17:51] home if i just didn't have to go if i
[1:17:53] just had some time
[1:17:55] and then god gives you some time and
[1:17:56] it's like oh if i could just go to work
[1:17:59] if i just had something else to do you
[1:18:02] realize
[1:18:03] god is breaking us god is breaking
[1:18:05] everything god is changing and shaking
[1:18:06] up everything
[1:18:07] so he can have it exactly the way he
[1:18:09] needs it to do what he wants to do
[1:18:11] when he wants to do it and i say god you
[1:18:13] can have it
[1:18:14] if you don't tell me what to do i won't
[1:18:16] do anything
[1:18:17] i say very much that's the way i felt
[1:18:19] lately he hasn't told me what to do
[1:18:22] so there's nothing i can do we just do
[1:18:25] what we can
[1:18:26] we submit to what we have to submit to
[1:18:28] because he hasn't told us what to do
[1:18:30] we just wait for the lord move forward
[1:18:33] by faith
[1:18:34] asking god to lead us step by step
[1:18:36] because we don't have this thing figured
[1:18:37] out
[1:18:38] we don't have tomorrow figured out we
[1:18:40] don't have the next service figured out
[1:18:41] all we know is that we want him to be in
[1:18:43] absolute control of me
[1:18:47] god can make it look bad and then he can
[1:18:50] make it look worse
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:53] are we willing to let him do that that's
[1:18:56] a good question
[1:18:58] are we willing to let him are we willing
[1:19:01] to let him make us look like the fools
[1:19:03] so that he can accomplish this goal are
[1:19:06] we willing
[1:19:07] i want to be willing i can just say i
[1:19:10] want with all my heart i want to be
[1:19:11] willing
[1:19:12] it's hard the inactivity is hard the
[1:19:15] weakness is hard
[1:19:16] the doing nothing is hard the feeling
[1:19:19] like your wings are pinned down and
[1:19:21] you're shoved into a cage when you know
[1:19:22] that you can fly
[1:19:24] you know that you can speak you know
[1:19:25] that you believe the word
[1:19:27] you know that you can overcome and god
[1:19:28] says be still that's hard
[1:19:32] but i want it i want him i want him to
[1:19:35] have
[1:19:35] absolute control and preeminence in me
[1:19:38] we love you appreciate you guys coming
[1:19:40] out tonight appreciate the atmosphere
[1:19:42] you create you created
[1:19:44] and i tell you even preaching like this

[1:21:50] different
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] brother dave wood took sister bessie to
[1:21:55] the hospital
[1:21:56] he wasn't allowed to go in
[1:22:00] that's a new kind of trial you've got a
[1:22:03] sick wife
[1:22:04] for five days she's in a room all by
[1:22:06] herself
[1:22:07] nobody could go in and comfort her even
[1:22:10] the staff doesn't want to be there
[1:22:11] spends as little time as possible goes
[1:22:13] in and gets out and they're all dressed
[1:22:14] up and suited up
[1:22:17] but dave even before he knew his wife
[1:22:18] was admitted he had to sit in the car in
[1:22:20] the parking lot of the er
[1:22:22] for five hours four or five hours to
[1:22:24] wait to see if his wife
[1:22:26] would be admitted and then when he found
[1:22:28] out she was admitted he had to turn his
[1:22:29] car around and drive home and go back to
[1:22:31] an empty house while his wife
[1:22:35] do you realize what god's doing he's
[1:22:38] proving who's in control and who's the
[1:22:39] strong one here
[1:22:41] he's getting us in positions where we're
[1:22:43] helpless and incapable
[1:22:45] and the strong ones can't help the weak
[1:22:47] ones
[1:22:50] because he's going to be the only strong
[1:22:51] one
[1:22:53] you know how many times i've known the
[1:22:54] people were sick in the assembly
[1:22:56] and my desire was to grab this anointing
[1:22:58] on there to run to their house and god
[1:22:59] said
[1:23:00] no told me no
[1:23:03] and i knew it would work because we
[1:23:06] believed the word
[1:23:07] but god in my heart told me no my wife
[1:23:10] even asked me can you go pray for them
[1:23:12] god told me no why
[1:23:16] he's going to be the strong one he's
[1:23:18] proving that he can get us
[1:23:20] alone by ourselves isolated
[1:23:23] nobody else to come and show up as the
[1:23:26] strong one he's going to be the strong
[1:23:28] one
[1:23:29] brother gene petrie is all by himself in
[1:23:31] a hospital i told my wife last night
[1:23:34] i would be willing to do quarantine if
[1:23:36] they would just let me sit in his room
[1:23:38] i would just sit in his room and talk to
[1:23:40] him and comfort him and be there with my
[1:23:42] brother that's the place i want to be
[1:23:44] i would quarantine for two weeks if i
[1:23:45] could just be with brother gene
[1:23:48] but god's the one who said no nobody
[1:23:51] else can go in that room he's there by
[1:23:53] himself
[1:23:55] what's god doing he's showing who's
[1:23:57] going to be the strong one
[1:23:59] and he's showing amen that his strength
[1:24:02] is made perfect
[1:24:03] in our weakness when we can't do for one
[1:24:06] another
[1:24:07] when we can't show up and be the strong
[1:24:09] one when god can take somebody who's
[1:24:11] weak
[1:24:11] and sick amen confused in their mind
[1:24:14] isolate them from their family
[1:24:16] isolate them from the church put them in
[1:24:18] a place that's surrounded by unbelief
[1:24:20] and he can show up mighty on their
[1:24:21] behalf and heal them and deliver them
[1:24:24] who gets credit for that only one
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] amen god is doing exactly what he
[1:24:32] intends to do
[1:24:33] and he's proving who's god and he's
[1:24:35] proving who the husband and he's proving
[1:24:37] who the shepherd is he's proving who the
[1:24:39] pastor is he's proving who the minister
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:41] he's proving who can deliver
[1:24:44] it's been a hard time for all of us it's
[1:24:47] a hard time for families it's a hard
[1:24:49] time for ministry it's a hard time for
[1:24:51] me
[1:24:51] it's a hard time for you this has been a
[1:24:53] hard time
[1:24:54] but god is showing who he is and he's
[1:24:57] showing that
[1:24:58] he doesn't need our strength
[1:25:02] he doesn't need hey man he doesn't need
[1:25:04] us to provide
[1:25:06] a support system or a strong arm to lean
[1:25:08] on he can be the strong arm to lean on
[1:25:11] when all of their arms are taken away
[1:25:13] there's one that
[1:25:14] nobody can take away men
[1:25:17] they can limit access at a hospital but
[1:25:20] they can't stop god from coming in that
[1:25:22] room
[1:25:24] it may be able to to limit access in
[1:25:27] churches
[1:25:27] and limit how much we can have
[1:25:29] fellowship and how close we can come
[1:25:30] together but they can't stop
[1:25:32] god from being the strong arm that we
[1:25:34] lean on no government can ban him no
[1:25:36] hospital can put him out
[1:25:38] no disease can separate us from them
[1:25:40] amen god is showing us
[1:25:41] that through this trial we can lean on
[1:25:44] him and he's enough
[1:25:47] amen i mourn it i don't enjoy it i i
[1:25:50] have complained about it
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:53] god forgive me but i have complained
[1:25:56] about it
[1:25:56] i have i i have bickered and i have been
[1:26:00] bitter and i've
[1:26:01] i've done all of those things that i've
[1:26:02] had to repent of
[1:26:04] but god has ordained this time
[1:26:07] for the bride and for this church in
[1:26:10] particular
[1:26:10] and he's showing us something that we
[1:26:12] would have never learned any other way
[1:26:15] and i believe we're going to come out of
[1:26:17] this with a greater confidence in him
[1:26:18] that we've ever had before in our lives
[1:26:21] and we're gonna know i mean there's
[1:26:23] nothing like facing something head-on
[1:26:25] the whole world's afraid of it
[1:26:26] and we've had to face it head-on
[1:26:29] and god shows that he can heal it
[1:26:32] doesn't matter if it's a new disease an
[1:26:33] old disease it doesn't matter if it has
[1:26:35] a weird name
[1:26:36] or an old name it doesn't matter if it's
[1:26:37] cancer tuberculosis
[1:26:39] it's been defeated before and if a new
[1:26:40] one pops up with a new name
[1:26:42] the same blood of jesus christ the same
[1:26:45] stripes on his back heals this one like
[1:26:47] he healed all others
[1:26:49] and god has made us face it and face it
[1:26:52] down
[1:26:52] to realize the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:55] amen the blood of jesus christ is more
[1:26:57] powerful
[1:26:58] than any device of the devil
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:02] and we would have rather dodged it
[1:27:05] you know but god made us face it
[1:27:08] and find out that his healing power is
[1:27:11] the same
[1:27:13] that his power to deliver is the same
[1:27:16] and god is good friends
[1:27:20] if that's what he wanted that's what we
[1:27:23] wanted
[1:27:24] we would have never asked for it we
[1:27:26] would never set the circumstances up
[1:27:27] like they've been set up
[1:27:29] but if that's what he wants that's what
[1:27:30] we want and in our weakness
[1:27:33] may his strength be made perfect may he
[1:27:36] show himself
[1:27:37] mighty on our behalf not because we were
[1:27:40] mighty but because he was mighty
[1:27:42] we were needy he was mighty we were
[1:27:44] helpless he was our helper
[1:27:47] i thank god for that we've learned a lot
[1:27:50] and i think we'll learn more but our
[1:27:53] confidence should be increasing in our
[1:27:55] husband
[1:27:56] to take care of his little bride and
[1:27:59] let's just bow our heads and ask the
[1:28:00] lord's blessing as we go dear heavenly
[1:28:02] father
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:04] we thank you lord jesus we thank you god
[1:28:08] for your goodness
[1:28:09] and for your mercy to us lord you have
[1:28:12] proved yourself
[1:28:14] you've proved yourself mighty on our
[1:28:16] behalf you've proved yourself capable
[1:28:19] when we in our flesh were incapable lord
[1:28:21] you were capable
[1:28:23] your words never failed it's never
[1:28:25] diminished by one ought lord when we
[1:28:28] found out we were insufficient
[1:28:30] when we found out that we couldn't fight
[1:28:33] the system
[1:28:34] we couldn't stop lord the regulations
[1:28:38] lord we couldn't even stop lord sickness
[1:28:40] from entering our bodies
[1:28:43] god we found out you were more than able
[1:28:45] to deliver
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:47] you're everything that we need lord we
[1:28:49] don't need a plan

[1:29:00] you to prove yourself mighty on behalf
[1:29:02] of our brother gene
[1:29:04] that you would do the same for him as
[1:29:06] you've done for others that you'd bring
[1:29:07] him out and you'd raise him up with a
[1:29:08] mighty hand and make him strong
