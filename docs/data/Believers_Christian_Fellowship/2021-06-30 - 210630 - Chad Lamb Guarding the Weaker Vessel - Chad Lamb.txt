preeminence in us in jesus christ's name we pray amen and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to genesis chapter 2. i'm going to continue with the thought we were on but i'd like to call this this evening guarding the weaker vessel guarding the weaker vessel i've had a few quests somebody questioned me about this sunday communion service because it's the fourth but we will be having communion service as usual for anybody who's able to make it would like to stay for community service so you can plan on that as normal let's look at genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the lord god caused the deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh in my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen you may be seated may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word and may he open his word to us this is the scripture that we started with last time as we were seeing and demonstrating and showing through the scripture that the woman was made differently than the rest of creation as god brought forth creation he brought forth creation a certain way but when he came to this to when he came to this woman when he was making a wife or a son he the wife was in the sun and he pulled her out and he did it differently than he made everything else and there was a reason why he did that and so i just want to refresh our memory and read these two quotes together in invisible union brother branham says when you see the woman a byproduct not another female like her made in that order knowing that she could be deceived god knowed if he didn't know the end from the beginning then he wasn't god if he is an infinite if he can't be infinite without being omniscient omnipresent knowing all things eternal so he knowed all things and he had to make that woman you the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist and masculine spirit and himself he had to separate take a byproduct after the whole creation made no female created by god and the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knowed she would do it if he didn't he wasn't god but see the attributes that's in god had to be displayed oh praise god amen when we look at this god when he's when he's fashioning his creation he's going through creation and he's making everything that he made and all the beasts of the field were coming up the same way and he made him here for adam to find the help meet we went through all of this but we find that there was no suitable help me so god did something different something he hadn't done yet and he pulled out of adam a rib and he formed from that rib the woman and reintroduced her back to the man and those two were one flesh and the reason god did that is because there was attributes locked inside of himself god did that because he had attributes locked inside of himself and those attributes that were locked inside of himself were healer and savior redeemer and all of these things that god wanted to express so in order for god to express it he has to have something like we said before that will open the door so the woman is the woman is instrumental or key to the redemption plan of god and then she has a major part to play in the redemption plan of god and she was made that way well god knew that she would fall he knows she would do it but he he if he didn't he wasn't gone but see the attributes that's in god that's in god had to be displayed so how's he going to display it if nothing will fall then all of these things he's locked inside of him these attributes these characteristics can't be displayed so god took from adam made a byproduct amen and she had the ability to fall there was something in her where she could make a choice and open the door to the fall amen so that all that was locked inside of god could come out and be displayed so we know she was a weaker vessel because she was made this being made this way made her the weaker vessel but she has made a weaker vessel for a purpose according to the plan of god and because god has equity in all things because she was used to open the door to the fall so the attributes of god could flood out god would take this very same vessel of a woman and from her would bring forth a seed amen and that would be christ amen the redeemer so she is tied to redemption this woman you see the attributes that's in god had to be displayed he has to be a savior and to make everything perfect the way he had it then there could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women we're at the end rune brother brandon when he says that he's saying say wake up amen and look at this word that's being revealed we're not taking a bunch of sunday school stories but the word has painted the picture and there's a prophet here in the last day to illuminate this word so we can see what it's all been about amen and we we begin to understand when we begin to understand what happened in the fall and the way god made everything and why the bible is written the way it's written why the woman was constructed differently than every other female was constructed what was the purpose and all that when we begin to see all that oh my goodness the plan of god just begins to unfold right here in genesis it's so exciting in the church age book out of the thythian church age the prophet of god says let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and him there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it come to man there was only one they were not a pair adam had been made the image of god he was a son of god and as soon as as the son of god he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so god took a byproduct of a man to cause the fall god didn't cause the fall god can't create a fall and be just but god made her in such a way she could fall by her own free choice woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was produced from man and when god caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female creation can be immoral but the human female can be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as a receptacle of the spirit and the blessings of god on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she is called the bride of christ on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is similarly cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen so this weakness that's in this woman the weakness that's implanted there was for a purpose amen but but as we talked about last time we look at we look at this weakness in so many times it's been exploited or misunderstood or misrepresented or misused but god designed her the way he wanted her she wasn't an afterthought so we spent a lot of time talking about this she was an original thought of god but she wasn't made in the original fashion that he made all the other females because he needed think about this he needed this woman he needed her to open the door because god had in him attributes locked so he needed the woman to be able to open the door and when she opened the door it started a process of redemption amen that was going to display all the attributes of god and god was going to continue to use this woman and now there was going to be a battle a warfare that's going to start over this vessel and the devil now is going to try to always use this woman this is the way he always comes in through this woman remember he he came in even in in solomon's kingdom solomon's a type of christ and solomon wiser than any man and he established the golden age the type of the millennium for israel but what was it that caused the fall of solomon it was his wives amen because the devil always comes in through the woman is that true so he was told don't marry these women they'll lead your heart away don't marry the women when you come into the land unless they cause you to serve other gods but solomon and knowledge of his wisdom he ignored that commandment and he went and he multiplied to himself wives and exactly what the scripture said is exactly what happened to him and and and the devil used the woman but the devil's using the woman and god is going to use the woman it depends on what the woman yields herself to they're going to use the same instrument the devil is trying to use the woman to bring about his eden amen and god is going to use the woman to collapse his eden making her very peculiar she has a very peculiar position let's look at genesis chapter 3 and verse 16. god now in the judgment he comes down and begins to judge after the fall and he says unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee brother has some things to say about this in marriage and divorce he says it was then man was made to rule over the woman by god's word she has no more she was no more co-equal with him she was co-equal in nature you know but when she broke god's word god made man to be a ruler over her genesis 3 16. so now god gives a commandment and he says now your desire shall be to your husband he shall rule over thee brother madam said they were co-equal amen before this in nature but that's that was so that she could fall that was so god's plan could be unlocked so the attributes of god could be unlocked through the fall and so she opened the door but afterwards god is now going to be a protection he's going to bring a protection to this weaker vessel because he made her thus now once she served that purpose and opened the door god is now going to take this woman and put her under the headship of a man not for punishment but for protection amen and when it begins to be viewed as punishment then all of a sudden we've missed the whole purpose of what god is doing we misunderstood something from the very beginning amen and the prophet of god came and explained it to us so well that this woman was made because there was attributes locked in god he needed to make her in such a way that she could make the choice but it was not becoming to him to allow one of his original creations made in the original way to fall that way so he would take a byproduct off the original creation form it and set her there co-equal with the man and she had an opportunity a door a mechanism in which she could open to start the cycle of redemption to release the attributes of god and as soon as she released the attributes of god now that served the purpose in the original and now god comes to the woman and says now your desire shall be your husband he shall rule over you now i'm going to protect you because i made you thus and you've served your purpose now i'm going to protect you and that's why when we get into laodicean with the feminist movement it's a slap in the face of god because they want to come out from under the headship of man and be co-equal or superior in many ways and that whole mentality is rejecting the very purpose by which god made the woman and the protection he placed her under this was god's grace this was god's love to her it was not a punishment and so when a woman wants to move out from the place that god placed her in and moved somewhere else she's rejecting the very word of god and rejecting the love of god because it was the love of god that placed through there so once we we start going through these things and understanding what god did in the original and how god did and how god placed it it takes all the false ideas away and it throws away all man-made understanding and ideas about headship and submission and throws them out completely out and brings it right back to god's original intention like i told you before i always want to know the why behind the why behind the why amen god didn't just say oh you know you messed up now now you're under this man and he's going to be the king and you're going to be the subservient one that wasn't god's picture at all god's picture at all he said i need this woman for redemption purposes i need her i need her to play a certain role i need to fashion her a certain way she's going to unlock my attributes i don't think god was looking at her and saying she's worthless she's no good she's subservient she messed up she's i'm throwing her under the man because i don't like her anymore that wasn't she served exactly her purpose so god said once you served your puppers because i fashioned this way i'm now going to bring a level of protection to you because of the way you're made and when a woman wants to be co-equal with god she absolutely denies the god who made her the way she is thinking co-equal or and superior amen she absolutely is denying what god placed there for a purpose and rejecting the god who created her he said now god made man to be her ruler over her we're still in marriage and divorce genesis 3 16. if you want to put it down she was no more equal with the man she was the breaker of god's word don't you see she she the church down here brother branham is running parallels between the woman at the beginning and the church see the church down here the breaker of god's word that throwed her completely out of continuity and that's why the church has done and throwed spiritual death upon the whole thing now you'll understand why i hammer at these things like i do it's the truth this is bible facts so brother branham is not just hammering at the hammering he's trying to bring us back to the bible let's turn to first corinthians 11. the new testament picks this up we're going to read it out from paul and from peter they continue this same theme on down through because they understand what god has done and they understand why god has done it and in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 we'll begin with that verse but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor this on earth his head but every woman that prayeth her prophesies with her head uncovered dishonored her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is in the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man see she's made that way she came out of man she is now the glory of man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels this word power is authority she has a sign of authority on her head because of the angels and brother ben says the messengers the men nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so the man also by the woman but all things of god judging yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is her glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering so now the the apostle paul's coming and talking about the headship and when he goes to headship he takes headship and ties it right right to the hair amen this is why when brother branham is preaching on long hair amen he's not just this isn't just a man being picky amen and trying he understands the whole picture like paul understands the whole picture amen the woman has to have a sign of authority upon her head amen because that's how god fashioned it amen god wasn't having afterthoughts god wasn't trying to clean up his mess god made her a certain way with the weakness to open the door but he had a plan for her to have a covering and then his plan would be that she would be under authority she'd be under headship for her protection amen so god could keep her protected but still use her in the plan of redemption so the hair the hair is is more than just it's not just a doctrine to make you write it's not just saying well we get all this right we get it right it paints the same picture it goes all the way back to genesis 3 16. it's not just new let's go to first peter chapter 3. first peter chapter 3 and we'll start at verse one first peter chapter three verse one likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of the plotting of the hair of the wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted it god adored themselves being in subjection to their own husbands now when paul or peter here when peter's talking when he look we let's go back to verse 4 he says even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price peter's not giving you his preference on the way a woman should conduct herself he's he's going back and showing you this is what god wants this is what god's desire and this is in the in the eyes of god of great value amen it's not that that peter says you know you need to be meek and quiet but god wants the woman to be meek and quiet he doesn't want her to be like the man he wants her to be subject subject to the man which is the sight of god a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection and to their own husbands even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife is unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered we took this verse and started with it i believe on sunday but talked about where he says likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge dwell with them according to knowledge because now you know why she's made the way she's made now you know what's different and why it's different amen now dwell with her according to knowledge giving honor our great value unto the weaker vessel giving honor to thy wife is unto the weaker vessel as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so now peter says have understanding have knowledge understand dwell with your wife according to knowledge understand the way she's made women understand the way you're made come together the way god brought this picture together and everything will be all right but when we start to mix up this picture by our own reasoning we start to ruin the picture that god has laid down and it won't come out right and and the reason that this matters so much is because brother ben will take the lady's same foundational truth down and he'll tie it right back to christ in the church amen just like the apostle paul did and the question that i like to pose is if we're not able to manifest the word in the natural are we manifesting it in the spiritual because we say you know i'm subject to christ i'm obedient to my headship which is the word i'm doing all this but if we're not able to actually display this and manifest in the flesh are we actually doing it like we think we are in the spiritual because one is a type of the other and one is a reflection of the other and if we can't get this harmony in our homes and we can't get a man who will love his wife and treat her as christ treated the church and we can't get a man to take responsibility for his wife and a woman to have a meek and quiet spirit and subject herself to her husband even as sarah did to abraham calling him lord if we can't get there because the laodicean ideas and conflict in the home the question is are we doing it as the bride of jesus christ that's why these things matter we can't have one completely in disorder and say well the other one's fine i'm fine with christ i'm the bride of christ why is this in such disharmony and disorder if everything's fine over here if everything's fine over here it should be displaying itself in the family it should be uh there should be a man who's caring for his wife who's loving her and protecting her and overshadowing her there should be a wife that's submitting herself to her husband under his care and under his love with a meek and quiet spirit it should be a natural outcropping of the revelation that we have in this hour that's what brother ben said you find these pentecostal women they have long hair and enough temper to fight a buzz all he said that's not it there's still something wrong amen it looks like we got something amen but it's not manifesting the life that the word called for it's not it's not displaying the picture it's not a mini drama showing the great drama some things got twisted up somewhere so the truth of the word brings the revelation to bring understanding let's go to first corinthians chapter one first corinthians chapter 1 verse 25. because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble or called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised ye god has chosen god god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence so god he created amen he created the woman a weaker vessel so that he could use it for redemption but he's going to take the weak things because he's going to use a bride in the end time seemingly weak and he's going to take the weak things to confound those things that are strong to overthrow those things that are strong because we said last time the devil doesn't understand weakness he doesn't understand humility he doesn't understand surrender those are attributes that he doesn't understand and so god was always coming low amen in a low way god is always taking down and tearing down the mighty strong things of the enemy remember when moses was going to deliver the children of israel he he had heard words that his mom told him he had an intellectual understanding of being a deliverer and what it meant to be a deliverer but god had not yet caught into that yet so he went out of his own free will he was going to perform the word amen because his mom had told him the prophecy his mother had nursed him and told him who he was he was born a proper child and the prophecy of 400 years and deliverance and all of these things he had been taught so under an education under a christian education he went forth to master the word he went forth to perform the word and he slew in his strength one egyptian amen and then he was rejected by his brother and he ran off to the wilderness because it wasn't yet god's time it wasn't yet god's way although he was god's choice it wasn't the right time so god allowed him in defeat to run to the wilderness and he allowed him to get weaker over the course of 40 years and until he got so weak when god finally came in a very supernatural display by coming in a burning bush and speaking to him he had become so weak he wouldn't even go back he began to argue with god i can't do it i can't speak i can't go back they won't listen to me he had a million excuses for why he couldn't do it and he had finally gotten to the condition that god wanted amen you see god didn't want him in his strength to fulfill the word god wanted the fill that fulfills word through moses he didn't want moses to do it god wanted to do it and so god chose a weaker vessel so that he could get glory for it let's turn to the book of esther i want to contrast two queens just to paint the picture of what i'm trying to say and we know these things really well but i'd like to go through these scriptures let's go to the book of esther and look at chapter 2. i want to look at the character of esther but we want to see the condition that esther is going to be in esther is coming from she's an orphan girl being raised by a cousin she she is going to be picked and selected to go into the house of virgins to be in this contest of sorts to see who would be the next queen and she's going through the process of purification and going through all of these things but if we follow esther's character and the way god uses esther we're going to be able to understand something about the bride and what god is looking for in esther chapter 2 verse 15. i'm just going to read just a couple little verses out of this now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her first daughter had come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper the woman appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked on her let's go down to verse 20. esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him i want to i want to look at this character for a minute and type it with the character of the bride because esther would not use her own thinking esther would not use her own mind and esther was not using her own will but esther here is submitting to haggai and she's submitting the mordecai so you see that she can she can humble herself and submit under the headship that god has placed over her because under this headship she's under mordecai's headship and then when she moves to the house of the women she is under haggai's headship but under that headship she settles down and submits to that headship and her submission to the headship god placed over is going to exalt her to the position of queen not because she was smarter not because she was more beautiful not because she was able to figure anything out amen it wasn't her strength it was her submission that brought her from hadassah to esther from myrtle to star and it's not going to be the bride's strength it's not going to be her power her intelligence her ability to figure anything out that is going to have her exalted in this end time and have a great victory rot through her it is going to be her submission to the word it's going to be her surrender her submission her throwing down her own ideas and her own desires and just taking the headship that god gave her in this age and submitting under that headship and that headshit that submission to headship is going to bring a tremendous victory this is why the church ages failed because they couldn't stay submissive they couldn't stay the weaker vessel under the submission the headship that god gave him they had to start taking their own thinking had to become strong and every time the church became strong they fell and then god would get another weak one and start over and the next time they became strong they fell become strong they fell become strong they fell because god was looking for one that would just stay submissive let's come to the chapter 7 here in esther now haman we we know this story super well but haman is going to bring a destruction of the jews and and esther's a jew and mordecai's a jew and and there's a great destruction coming and haman's a powerful man and there's no way there's no possibility for esther or mordecai or anybody by force to be able to exert their own strength amen to be able to stop haman there's only one way amen that mordecai can see to stop the plan of haman and that one way lies in the submissive humble little esther she's the key for salvation she's the key for redemption in this story and it lies in esther but esther though she has the key she becomes the pivotal figure amen in the salvation of the jews amen though she becomes that pivotal figure she's the one that god's going to use it is all resting upon her she doesn't take that like moses did in the beginning and hear all the stories and believe them all and go out on their own strength to do something wonderful how is she going to bring about salvation how is she going to bring about a great deliverance she is going to humble herself mordecai comes and gives her instructions and she hearkens to the voice of mordecai she humbles herself she fasts she prays she puts on the royal apparel she comes into the king she asks the king she doesn't stomp in and make demands she comes in humbly and she comes in respectfully and she asks the king to a banquet of wine and he comes to the banquet with haman and then they feast that day and he asks her what is it that you want and she says come tomorrow and i'll do likewise and i'll tell you tomorrow so we pick up the story on the second trip the second day verse 7 or chapter 7 verse 1 so the king and haman came to the banquet with esther the queen and the king said again into esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to half the kingdom then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in my sight o king and if it pleased the king she goes right back to humility surrender and submission if it please the king let my life be given me at the petition in my people at my request for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed and to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bond men and bond women i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage then the king azaris answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so and esther said the adversary the enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen what might did esther use what power did she have how did she bring this great victory for the jews she just went humbly and reverently to the king and when she showed honor and respect to the king and she entertained the king and invited the king to her banquet amen then the king asked her what is it you want esther and esther said all i want is my life. and he said who and she said haman and then from then on the king takes care of the rest and brings the destruction you see esther never had to be powerful esther never had to be mighty esther didn't have to figure anything out all she had to do was respect and honor that king and show reverence to the king and entertain the king and serve the king and through her humility and her servants and her reverence the king would adore her and say what can i do for you and she would say just let me live i want eternal life and they'll say to her who is this that's taking your life she said it's this wicked haman that i'm stuck in you see we can get the wrong idea sometimes about what our role is because god is going to use the woman and he does all down through the bible he uses the woman for redemption he uses the woman for for uh for redemption for deliverance all through the bible but if you look it's through submission subjection to humility and in the end time god's going to do the same thing but what kind of wife is it going to take what kind of queen does he want does he want one that's going to stomp around and make bold claims say god you have to do this and god you're going to do that or does he want one that says oh god i love you i just want to serve you i just want to keep your word let's turn to first kings and now let's look at jezebel she's the other queen we want to look at first kings 21. and verse 3. yeah first kings chapter 21 verse 3 and nabath said to ahab the lord forbid at me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and they have came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which nabot the jezreelite had spoken him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread but jezebel's wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat is no bread and he said unto her because i spake in the naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it pleased thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel's wife said unto him does thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite see this is a different queen this is a wicked queen this is a heathen queen where esther is a different nature all together one thinks she can do something about it the other one realized there was nothing she could do she was going to need the king and if she was going to need the king she was going to have to honor and reverence subject herself and entertain the king here's here is jezebel who has no confidence in the king she's putting the king down amen and putting the king under her and said you're not capable but leave it to me i'll deliver it for you this is the same kind of attitude we see in revelation chapter 18 with the great which is called jezebel let's go down to verse 15. we know she works her plan in down to 15 she says and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and he was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for nabath is not alive but dead and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of nabat the jezreelite to take possession of it we've got two big problems here we got a woman who's out of her place and we have a man who's out of his place brother brahm says in the message be certain of god he said god loves his church but when we get out of the will of god the enemy takes the church over and ahab who was king of israel at that time and to my thinking the most wicked king israel ever had because he married an idolater jezebel she was a sinner and an ungodly person and instead of being a man of his own house he gave in to her and through that and and through that they had caused the nation to come to moral decay brother abraham says again in the thythe and church age now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real man makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertains to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a man or mail or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself and when a woman evades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she is of being a dominant female is antichrist and seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true in every man's word a lie let's go to first timothy chapter 2. first timothy chapter 2 verse 11 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffered not a woman to teach in order to serve authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first form then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so when the when the apostle paul speaking here in timothy when he when he lays down the order of authority and he tells a woman that he doesn't allow a woman to teach her to serve authority but to be but to be in silence he goes right back to genesis paul is not paul is not just he's not just after women he's not just coming up with his own thing where did paul get this he got it out of genesis he goes right back to the fall there's something he understands about the fall and something he understands about the woman and he understands what god did in genesis 3 16 and he's bringing all that into the church and he's placing it in a church according to what he saw back in genesis for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression that's why she's been placed under headship that's why the man takes authority over her that's why she's silent in the church that's why she's subject because god is typing it with his church with his bride brother he refers to this scripture and why we're not a denomination he says i want to read how many believes that paul was an inspired teacher now remember paul wrote this to timothy first corinthians 14 32 and he reads the scripture first he reads the first line let your women keep silence in church he said did you hear what he said let your women keep silencing churches first not permitting them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience have you got a marginal reading on that if you are run it back and see if it don't take genesis 3 16 when god told eve because that she had listened to the serpent instead of her husband he'd rule over her all the days of her life how can the woman come and rule over a man be pastor and deacon when the bible said let her be obedient just like it was in the beginning god can't change you can't make the word say one thing here and another thing over here it don't do it it's the same thing all the time this is one major theme in the bible it's not disjointed he's not saying one thing in the old testament something new in the in the new testament it's one theme it's one picture it's painting one story amen and we got to see the continuity of the scripture all the way through and because we've lost the picture of the word amen now we live in a society like we live in that is so perverted they've got so far away from the word how did we get to the place where churches are accepting homosexuality and the debating over homosexual marriage and over ministers and and women ministers and homosexual ministers where how did we get so far because they left the simple things because we lost the picture of the bible we lost a picture of the bible we took it to reasoning and they started saying things like you know the apostle paul he was just after the women he had something against the women he was extra hard on women the apostle paul had nothing against women he wasn't extra hard on women the apostle paul had the revelation of the word he knew what happened in the garden of eden he knew what happened in genesis and why god said what he said what was paul doing paul was confirming what the word had already said paul was bringing into the church what god had already established he saw the pattern and he lifted the pattern and he put it here and that's what's happening in our marriages and in our homes and in our churches we're seeing the pattern and we're just lifting the pattern amen by the word of god and putting the pattern on us on our families on our children in the church what is it it's the same picture it's the same picture in your life it's the same picture in your home it's the same picture in the church it should all be speaking the same thing and my human reasoning they begin to reason boy why did paul say that and does it really mean that and does it apply to the day and then i was i was driving down the road one day with a an account rep that was an account rep for a product we sold and we're driving down the road and i found out that this man was ordained a nazarene preacher he was an associate pastor of a as a nazarene church he had credentials went to school had the papers had all of that and he started telling us we started talking about something i don't remember what it was he started telling us that they had just elected a new president or whatever the head of the nazarene church was and it was a woman and i asked him the question i said do you think that's a good thing he said oh yeah and he started telling me why it was a good thing because she understands families better because we've had a one-sided view the men's side for so long and now we can get the opinion of a woman and bring the nazarene church into a greater balance and better serve women and better serve families i thought how do you get to this place because we take reasoning and the woman started thinking she knew as much as the man the word instead of just staying in subjection she began to use her reasoning i'm talking about the woman of the church she began to think that she was just as good as the word that she was equal to the word and her or her ideas were just as good as the word that she could understand the word instead of just submitting to it she could reason with it and we get so far out of the line and i began to talk to this man about the scripture and i started just going back through the scriptures and as we went to the scriptures the man said he says now you have to understand why paul said that i said praise god let's understand why paul said that he said if you go back and read the history and all the documents in that time you'll find out that the women were unruly so he told them to keep science because they were standing up and yelling across to one another and they were very unruly i'm telling you so wise we become fools and i asked him i said i said why would god give us a bible that we couldn't trust he said what i said why would god give us a bible and then we would have to go find historical documents because the bible doesn't paint the right picture but if we go get the historical documents then we'll understand what paul's saying so we can reject what's written in the word i said that doesn't make any sense to me i said if we just stick with the word it paints the right picture and that's what's happened all around us friend and unfortunately that thing tries to creep in little by little but i say don't even let it creep in a little amen let's stick with the picture god gave us because the picture's perfect it's for a reason god did it for a reason friends and if we can keep the image right we'll benefit from that brother says in questions and answers on hebrews listen here the man is the ruler don't you think you can rule the house you're not the ruler of the house you're absolute you're not a slave now but you're a help mate and the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his wife one thing that you'll find it like i said before there's an equity with god god will put woman the woman underneath the headship of the man but with with with that comes a great tremendous responsibility now the man is going to give an answer to god for the conduct of his wife but the wife is not going to answer for the conduct of her husband so when god takes this and he and he puts the he puts the headship over the woman and the woman under the headship of the man now the responsibility lies on the man to guide and to shepherd to nurture and to care for his wife and lead her in the way it is right because he's going to answer for her conduct but she's not going to answer for his and i say god put me under the headship of christ let him answer for me let him answer for me if i can just stay subject to him brother bem says in sirs we would see jesus i don't care if you don't even know your abcs just the only thing you have to do the only thing you have to have is a humble submitted heart to god and god will work his will through you let's turn to the book of ruth back here before samuel after judges the book of ruth chapter 3. verse 6. and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bathed her here comes young ruth she's a widow now and naomi's her mother-in-law and they come into the land and she's gleaning and we we know the story there there's all this that's happening between boaz and his servants and her and and now naomi tells her a plan you go down to the threshing floor amen and tell her give her specific instructions how to dress and what to do and to prepare herself and what to go and now ruth doesn't take her own mind amen but ruth now is going to be a key for redemption amen there's a key in ruth ruth holds the key to redemption naomi's land is not redeemed amen they're in a poverty stricken situation all the men are gone at this point and there is a key laying in ruth and ruth holds the key to redemption but ruth is not going to go by her force and by power and by wisdom and by strength she's just going to submit herself to the leadership of naomi naomi's going to tell her what to do and she's just going to follow what naomi tells her because naomi is her mother-in-law let me read this again chapter 3 verse 6 and when she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and then covered his feet and later down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art and near kinsmen and she's saying i need you to cover me it was symbolic of him becoming her head of him covering her spreading his skirt to include her and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning and so much as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city and my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman virtue means strength ruth was a virtuous woman she had strength strength of character but her strength was not what produced her redemption she had the strength to submit herself she had the strength to just surrender amen and lay down at this man's feet because naomi amen needed redemption they all needed redemption and the only path was for ruth to submit herself and lay herself at the feet of this man and when he woke up and he says who are you said i'm ruth cover me with your skirt will you cover me and become our head and bring redemption to us and he says thou art a virtuous woman she didn't do it through strength what was her virtue submission what is our virtue submission now listen i want to read a few quotes to bring this home to where we're at now now we find out that god gave his children the best they really don't have to improve it he never changes he hasn't changed one bit since the first time he gave for his children's protection now there was war in heaven he had to kick out satan then he come down on the earth and fortified his children with his word i want to ask you something just think now eve did not while she's standing in this great fortress of his word now satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of technique to get to her get her out of there for as long as she stayed behind the word everything was fine that's where we make our mistake we make our mistake when we get from behind the word so i believe all bible believers think it that way we get from behind the word then we're in trouble but as long as we keep the word ahead of us don't get ahead of the word let the word get ahead of you you just let it go first you just live right behind it it plows the ditch and you just walk in it let the word go before you don't get ahead of the word never try to lead the word let the word lead you you say we don't do that oh they do it worldwide it happens all over the place we try to get the word to say something we want it to say amen we try to make an excuse for an activity something we want to do or something we want to get away with or some of our own understanding and we tried to lead the word into our own will but he says don't lead the word you let the word lead you you just let it go first you just live right behind it it plows the ditch and you just walk in it you walk behind the word don't ever get ahead of the word the conflict between god and satan satan and eden when he first come to these attack attack a person knowing the children of god was fortified with his word satan attacked the word he never attacked the being the woman he attacked the word first see she was fortified behind the word she was protected by the word so satan could not come to her first he first had to attack the word and the devil doesn't come to you and i first he first comes to the word when he gets us to move away from the word then he can come to us we still have the same protection in this day if we just stay under the word and the message the feast of trumpets he says go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the camera into the presence of the king at the top of the steps was in the seventh step there shows that we're we've got to come again with that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he'd introduced it and we've we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah and brother brahma was talking about in the pyramid you come to the seven steps and at the seventh step there was somebody there to introduce you to the king and he types that with john he says we need that same thing now and friends we've had that same thing now something to introduce the messiah when in the seventh step in the seventh church age and how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word so what is the revealed word our husband our mate who introduced us messiah one with the same spirit that was in john the spirit of elijah in the seventh step he come to usher us into the presence of the king what was the presence of what is the king the king is the revealed word our mate our husband and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir there's no bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship and that's christ christ is the word oh my i love that yes sir as the head was took up from the grave so must his body follow into eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word so god because there was a weaker vessel amen this church you know when when when god took the man adam the first man and he pulled out of him a vessel that he was going to use to unlock the attributes in him he made a weaker vessel for redemptions purposes amen but when god struck christ and out of christ came the ingredients to make the church when that church was formed it was automatically a weaker vessel because that life came down to dwell in a tabernacle amen that had a carnal spirit and had a fallen nature amen in that that corn that that church by that carnal spirit took the word and took their own idea of the word and they fell away from their headship but god has brought back the church's headship so that we can come underneath the headship and underneath the headship of this word we can we can have power not our power his power how is the power going to be displayed the power the virtue what virtue virtue to submit virtue to surrender virtue to lay down at his feet and say cover me with your skirt i want to be under your headshed let's turn to ephesians chapter 5. ephesians chapter 5. and verse 22. ephesians 5 and 22 start there wives submit yourselves into your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wise be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherishes it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of those bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church so when we talk about headship when we talk about submission it's not just about headship and submission it's about christ and his church in the message christ as the mystery of god revealed the prophet says but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ they're given right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you'll just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters i mean his wife i want to ask you is god telling you secrets is god opening his word and he's is he showing you things that other ages haven't seen is he showing you things that you've never seen before is he whispering love secrets in your ears he's not doing that to the flirters he's only doing that to his wife and there's a reason that he's doing that friends because he's the headship the revealed word of this day is the headship that we submit ourselves under so he keeps revealing the word revealing the word revealing the word so that we can stay under his headship remember the devil first attacked the word to get her out from around the word so that he could attack her amen and as long as we stay under the headship of the word he can't get to us amen but the only way that he can get to us is he first has to attack the word amen and you have to let down on the word when you let down on the word and move outside the word then he can come and get you so what is the bridegroom doing today amen the bridegroom is here the revealed word is the headship over the church and he's here revealing love secrets to her because the love secrets is opening her eyes to the word so that when the devil comes to attack the word she says uh-uh my husband already showed me this tactic i saw it in esther i saw it in ruth i saw it in jezebel i'm not falling for that i saw what paul says amen i heard what peter says i'm not falling for that one devil that's the reason the bridegroom came in this day so that he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle every other one the word was attacked she used reasoning and moved away from the word then she was attacked but there's going to be one in this day a virtuous woman that will stay under the headship of the word brother mum says again in christ is the mystery god revealed now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected can you no denomination but the revelation of his mystery no denomination the revelation god is not known by the nomination he's known by revelation look god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride oh my god made manifest in christ christ made manifest in the bride and as god took from the body of adam the woman and she fell then god is took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with pure unadulterated word of god being manifested i hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that see she is the second eve but she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical moves you want to in all the affiliations this one's prophesied not to fall we talked about this before but she's prophesied not to fall not because god would look down through time and he'll say finally i've got a people on the earth that's better than the people that were here the generation before smarter wise or strong no that's not it there's a different thing that took place in this age and took place in the previous ages because now the bridegroom himself came down and the bridegroom is here whispering love secrets in her ear you realize adam was not deceived adam was not the weaker vessel the woman was the weaker vessel she was deceived if adam had been standing there whispering in her ear she would have never fallen for the tactics of the devil she she was there alone facing the devil and the devil was attacking the word and by reasoning she began to reason by the word and she come out from beyond the boundary of the word and then she was attacked and fell prey she was beguiled but adam was not deceived in the transgression so if adam would have been standing there whispering in her ear would she have fallen she fell because she had to open the door to release the attributes that were locked inside of god but god knew in the end time he would have one that wouldn't fall she's predestinated not to fall that this one fell this one fell this one fell this one fell but there's one predestinated not to fall so how is he going to keep her from falling she's still the weaker vessel so what's he going to do he's going to do something different in this day he's going to come down himself with his personal presence and he's going to be standing not next to her but inside of her and he's going to be whispering love secrets to her and no matter what the devil brings he's got a love secret to fight against it he's opening the word you realize he's opening the word day by day service by service tape by tape he's opening what's he doing he's making the bride an invincible army not because she's got some super mind but she's under the headship of the word and under the headship of the word he's got to go through the word first to get to you and if you stay under the headship he's not going to get to you the only way is for the weaker vessel to forget that she's a weaker vessel and start to think she can reason the word and she can figure out she can do and she can begin to act like jezebel but this bride's predestinated not to where does the power for overcoming come from it comes from submission submission to what submission to the headship that has come back in this day the revealed word let's read one scripture while the musicians come let's go to john chapter 8. john chapter 8 verse 31 john chapter 8 verse 31 then said jesus to those jews who believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed not if you started in his word but if you continue in his word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free oh i've got no strength i've got no ability i'm not no super nothing but what we've been given is our headship back and if we can just submit ourselves under that headship then god will take the weaker vessel and he will use her for redemption remember death came by the woman but life also came by the woman the same vessel that brought death god used the same vessel to bring life and there was a hidden strength in the weaker vessel and the weaker vessel the hidden strength revolves around life amen because so she's weak and though she's timid and though she's softer than a man and she's not as as physically strong or capable as a man amen doesn't have the endurance of a man amen i've never seen a man that could have a baby yet there's a hidden strength in the weaker vessel amen and it's so humble and so soft when jesus christ was was nailed to the cross it looked like there was no strength there amen but there was a hidden strength that the devil didn't understand and in this weaker vessel is a hidden strength that the devil doesn't understand it looks weak and it looks timid amen but that woman who's weak and not as strong as a man and not as durable and can't work as many hours amen when it comes to delivery time there's not a man on this planet that would trade places with her there's a strength that's laying there in her design and that strength has to do with bringing forth life and there's a bride on the earth in this day she doesn't have her own strength she doesn't have all she has is virtue the virtue to stay submitted to his word but there's a hidden strength laying there and it has to do with bringing forth christ in this day say god let me just stay submissive to you and humble use me for your glory amen let's just bow our heads and pray let's all stand and we'll pray let's all stand and then we'll pray lord jesus we thank you god we thank you for this day that you've put us on this earth lord and god you didn't leave us to ourselves and to our own strength and to our own abilities because we have none but you've chosen this day to take the weak things to confound the wisdom of the wise and those things that are not to bring the not the things that are and god you've collected a bride out of here and from over there and you've pulled us all together under your headship and there's a mystery laying in that weaker vessel lord that the world doesn't understand and the devil doesn't understand but god you're whispering love secrets in her ears you're keeping her under that headship under the protection of the word god let us stay under your word let us stay submitted and humble reverent help us be like esther to realize that our salvation is going to come from you that our strength lies in you not in the strength in our arms but the position that you've placed us in by your choosing you've chosen us and you've placed us and now if we can just respect you and humble ourselves before you show your reverence you have the power to deliver us you have the power to free us from haman let us show you the respect you deserve and stay submitted to your god reverent to your word submitted to your word humble before your word god we love you i pray god that you would take the weaker vessel in this day and by your power flowing through her would you do something wonderful lord what you've promised to do in this day help us god to keep surrendered unto you that you might work through us we as you bless us as we go from here use us for your glory help us to understand your word in deeper ways than we ever have before in jesus christ's name we pray amen bless you brethren here i am lord here i am i give all myself to the lord here i am here i am your spirit move through me lord here i am [Music] here i am my self to the
