Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and uh greet you in the name of the Lord. I uh uh want to send greetings from uh pastor uh he called me on the way here and uh so um he sends his love and greetings and uh looking forward to him coming back. He said he'd be here about Tuesday evening. And so, uh, anybody might have been catching the services. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been blessed and, uh, thought they were awesome so far. And, um, uh, I I got a I wouldn't say it's kind of along the same lines, but, I guess it is, cuz the open book's the open book. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I, uh, I was, I was happy to, uh, hear some of the things that he was saying. Always makes me feel good, uh, cuz that means we're getting our inspiration from headquarters. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, happy about that. So, um, if we could, we'll just get right into the scripture, uh, this morning. Um, I'd like to I'd like to read out of Ruth chapter 1. Thank you, musicians. And, uh, just like to thank this extra special thank you for Brother Franco. Uh, oh my, where would I be without brother Franco? He's awesome. And so uh uh I I I changed my font on my PowerPoint and then I got here and it was all jumbled up and I spelled my title wrong on the PowerPoint slide and boy I tell you and we need to give Brother Franco like a a big F like you know Super Franco and get him a red cape and everything here. Certainly uh appreciate him and you know he always does it with a smile. That's that's what I love about brother Franco. He he's awesome. So the book of Ruth uh the first chapter verse 14. And they lifted up their voice, and wept again, and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her. And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods. Return thou after thy sister-in-law. And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, nor to return from following after thee. For whether thou goest, I will go, and where thou lodest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried, the Lord do so to me, and more also if thou art but death part thee and me. When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. So they went unto until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them. And they said, "Is this Naomi?" And she said unto thee unto them, "Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went out fool, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty. Why then call you me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?" So Naomi returned in Ruth of Moabitis, her daughter-in-law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest. Uh I'd like to speak to you by the help of the Lord on loyalty. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, truly we love you. today and grateful to be called by your name, the name above every name. And we certainly want to make you feel welcome behind this pull pit, Lord, in each aisle way, wanting our spirits, Lord, to welcome you and that you would just have the preeminence that you would be at the forefront, Lord, and the very centerpiece of this service, the centerpiece of our hearts and lives, asking, Lord, your forgiveness. be upon us and help me, Lord, to just speak your word. I I don't know what your children need this morning, but I I know what's been on my heart and I just pray that something would be said to be a help. Asking Lord your blessings be upon brother Chad as he's laboring today, Lord. and the last service just asking your blessings would be upon him and you giving traveling mercies back home him and brother David Lord that they would just enjoy one another's company and fellowship and when the pressure's off they'd be able just to relax and we just ask Lord that you would help us this day to uh relax each one from me Lord on back that we could just enter in, Lord, to heavenly places and that you would just have the preeminence and we commit all we are into your hands and we ask these things to be so in Jesus lovely name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated if you like. loyalty and uh you know um Ruth and you know this is nothing new. we we know what she's a reflection of. And what I what I love about um the the first chapter here is that she was a real expression of loyalty that you know because we can all claim to be loyal but really loyalty really shows when the chips are down. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's uh loyalty is is is really proven, not proclaimed. We can we can all talk to talk and I can even preach on loyalty, but really it's our lives that's going to testify if we have true loyalty or not. &gt;&gt; And uh loyalty is is the same whether we win or lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, it it's it's when the chips are down is when roy loyalty is truly tested, right? You know, we we got we got young brothers and sisters getting married and you know, you got the you got the uh uh honeymoon and everything's fine and dandy and right and y'all know what I'm talking about. But &gt;&gt; but then after a few days, maybe hours that honeymoon starts to wear off and and you you start catching things that maybe you didn't realize that they were doing &gt;&gt; and and and and they start rubbing you the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Right. It's okay. You blink this twice if you want to say amen. [Laughter] And so, but but it's when things go bad. It's when we, you know, we can we can have a marriage certificate on the wall and and to prove that we're legally married, but it's when things start getting rough and and the lightning flashes and the thunder rolls, that's when uh our loyalty is truly tested. and and and I believe that Ruth is an example of this last day bride that when things are at its lowest uh that's when true loyalty is tested and proven &gt;&gt; and and so um you know cuz when you think about mo when you think about uh Ruth being a Moabitete you know uh uh she said that wherever you go I'm going to go and and and whoever your God is and I might that's who my God is going to be. And you know, I I I think Ruth had uh excuse me, Naomi had such a testimony because uh as the prophet taught us that when when she had left uh the promised land, she was backslid and and even though Naomi was in that backsliding condition because she wasn't in her promised land, she still had such a testimony that it had an impact upon Ruth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and to me, that's so profound that that when she would look at Naomi at her lowest, she would still see something that rang true. &gt;&gt; And and you know, uh because even in this message, there's always going to be highs and lows. You know, it's one thing when when a preacher preaches a message that you love and wow, it's it's fiery or there was such revelation rolling, but but wait till that minister hits a dry spell. &gt;&gt; Then where's your loyalty going to be? you know, um, and Ruth, you know, she had a lot of obstacles and a lot of hurdles because the the, you know, remember that Moabites were frowned upon in the promised land. And the the the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy 23:3, "An Ammonite or a Moabitete shall not enter the congregation of the Lord, even to their 10th generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever." &gt;&gt; So many times we'll we'll look at an illegitimate and we we we we want to look at that. But there was no grace for a Moabitete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? After 10 generations, then that illegitimacy could be purged from the from the family lineage. But being a Moabitete, it was nothing. &gt;&gt; Forever is forever. &gt;&gt; But but but Ruth could look at that and somehow say, "Your God is going to be my God." &gt;&gt; But she could look at her lineage and know where she come from. But she could still see something true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and to me, it's so profound for her to have the the the the scripture stacked against her, &gt;&gt; but yet she would still be a reflection of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Naomi though she felt that she was in bitterness cuz that's what Mara means. It mean bought the bitterness. But Naomi Ruth wouldn't call her Mara but she would say my delight. And and I think sometimes it's, you know, when we're at our lowest that we can really shine the brightest. It's when it's the darkest of nights is really the opportunity for us to shine the brightest. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You know, uh Job would say, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him." &gt;&gt; To me, that's true loyalty. that that he's not serving God so that he can be the elite of the elite. &gt;&gt; He's not serving God so that he can look down on his denominational brethren. That's right. &gt;&gt; And see that he has more than his coworker, &gt;&gt; that he has a greater light. But but whenever, you know, cuz slay means to murder. And so even though God would murder me, I'm still going to trust him. &gt;&gt; That's true loyalty. And brother Brandham says it takes a Gethsemane and a Calvary to make an Easter. It certainly did. How those apostles upon that morning when they were so discouraged until Peter said, "I am so discouraged. I believe I'll just go back fishing again. I'll go back. I I've seen him. They had great hopes and believed in everything until it come to that great darkening place. What was God doing? He was bringing those apostles to an ash sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was bringing them to a place where they would have their faith confirmed to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, it's when things go backwards, that's our opportunity to see if we really got the goods. &gt;&gt; Every everything is fine when revelation is flowing and and and we feel like we're 10t tall and bulletproof, but it's when we go through those dark times in life, when it seems like God steps back from us &gt;&gt; to see what we'll do. But if we would just take a moment and realize that he's doing that on purpose, not so much to confirm it to him because he knows the end from the beginning, but he's doing it so it'll confirm your faith &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; So that we'll realize that wait a minute, I am a true believer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because when what is integrity? It's doing the right thing when nobody's watching. &gt;&gt; It's it's it integrity is when no when you're in another state or another country, &gt;&gt; right? And and nobody's watching you, but yet you still do the right thing. That's true loyalty. And you know, uh, I I I think of the Statcliffe family and that there was a family that Brother Brennham, uh, had found favor with. And they had they had uh lost a baby and they they reached out to the prophet and they had asked him, you know, if he'd he'd pray and they they were expecting a miracle. And brother Brandham, as faithful as he was, he he he didn't just uh go off willy-nilly, but he said, "Let me pray over it." And and I believe he prayed all night if I'm not mistaken this story. And you know the breaking of the day and God told him, he said, "Don't you put your hand on it." And the the family had laid the baby away and the doctors had it in wait and under an auctioned intent and they were going to send an airplane from Germany to to pack that prophet back to Germany and fly him there and fly him back and they had everything waiting. But God said no. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God told that that that sister no and he said he said you know it's safe in the arms of God the Almighty. And she says something so profound. She said and and this is what I I I hope you can to me when I read this I can relate to it because she said she said what was it brother Brandham my weakness of faith. And just just in that statement, [Laughter] I saw y'all. Y'all weren't paying attention to me. Y'all was reading. [Laughter] But in that weakness of faith moment seemingly when when she and and what what's so profound to me is she didn't lash out at the Almighty &gt;&gt; and and that was proving her loyalty. &gt;&gt; But in her mind, she didn't even have a thought against God. But she was looking at herself &gt;&gt; going, "Lord, was it me?" &gt;&gt; Right? The same way we do as true believers, it's like, "God, did I do something wrong?" And that in itself proves who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and so and so, Brother Brandham, he goes, she goes, "Brother Brandham, my weakness of faith, I said, you have great faith. You prayed for your baby. You and your husband held on to it. God raised that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, and still you love him. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. &gt;&gt; When God can say no &gt;&gt; and his no is just as good &gt;&gt; as the yes that you wanted. I I'm so thankful brother Brandham says these things. He says, "And still you love him." That's real faith. For for the miracle not to happen because we we are so geared to want to see something. But God looks so much deeper. He says anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith, but let it go backwards one time &gt;&gt; and see how it works. That's when you prove whether you got faith or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's when God tells us no. And the no can be just as rich and real to us as his yes that we wanted it to be. &gt;&gt; That's that's true loyalty. &gt;&gt; It's it's when we don't get what we want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we ought to pray to change our will. This is the will that needs changing. Is my will, not God's will. Thy will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for us to be thankful that it his will is done on earth as it is in heaven, we have to be thinking of the heavenlies. And and as we go through this, I hope I hope our our I I I believe our brains need to be rewired. See, see Paul, Paul would say, "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious, but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am a chief. How be it for this cause I obtain mercy that in me first Christ Jesus Christ might show forth all look Paul was going to be a pattern of the longsuffering of God. a a man that would write a majority of this New Testament book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God would see it so fitting to have him as a pattern so that when we wanted so that it would be so locked in that when you want to know what God's long suffering is, you could look at Paul and go, he's the pattern. So when you feel like you've ran out of all of God's longsuffering in your life, you need to go back to Paul &gt;&gt; because he's the pattern, &gt;&gt; right? And he says, "For a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting." The man that had the coat that was that Stephen had been stoned by those group of men. And here he is. You know, Paul had a ministry of like 35 years. And and from the time of that stoning of Stephen, it was it was going to be a pattern of the long suffering of God. He was going to beam an example. You think of of of everything that Paul had and that everything Paul gave away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul was in remember because loyalty is losing and you're still just as faithful as if you won. &gt;&gt; It's when the chips are down, &gt;&gt; will you still serve him? It's when your prayer goes unanswered, will you still be loyal? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or will you hold a grudge? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the mirror we have to look in and really be honest with ourselves because your loyalty will be tested. And when you when you look at Paul Paul's life, when when Paul was struck down on the road to to Damascus, he he he had in his heart that he would arrest every one of them nose noise makers down there. All of this divine healing will stop it. Put it in his pocket. He said, "I'm on my road down." And that day by about 11:00 of the day, a light shone in his face and he fell to the earth. Why? He was a predestinated seed. God said, "I have chosen him, yay, and I'm going to show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake." Watch what he says. I'll send him to the Gentiles and disgrace his name in every way. &gt;&gt; So, this was a Pharisee of the Pharisee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That would walk blameless. You couldn't touch his life. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And here he is sacrificed all of that. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about loyalty? And what does God give him in return? &gt;&gt; He gives him disgrace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; He knocks him off of his high horse. &gt;&gt; Why? cuz he's cause because he's not elect. No, it's because he is elect. &gt;&gt; It's because he is a predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knows he'll be loyal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he's going to disgrace his name in every way. He's going to be mocked and made fun of and he's going to have to carry that in his heart. &gt;&gt; No doubt. has to think, God, why didn't you come to me a day earlier? Why didn't you come to me before I held the coats? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, that haunted him his whole life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when Stephen said, "Lord, lay not thy sin to their charge." When Paul is in a damp dark prison in AD67, 30 plus years afterwards, it still haunted him. &gt;&gt; Was he forgiven? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But the scar still remained. And when he's in a prison, think about this. When you read second Timothy, the prophet of God is not at a holiday in Express. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not surrounded by all his congregation. &gt;&gt; He's not in a comfy three hots in a cop. There is no commissary. &gt;&gt; Most y'all don't know what that is. Praise the Lord. Commissary when you go and you you you can get, you know, uh toothbrush and bag of ramen noodles and right meat sticks and cheese. Oh boy. But he's writing the eternal word of God &gt;&gt; in a dark, damp prison &gt;&gt; at the end of his life. And all he has no doubt rats and mice, spiders, and what he says when everybody at my first answer, no man stood with me. Think about this. He's pinning the books that we read. And as he's pinning this in pain, he says, "All men forsook me." The same way sometimes we can be sitting in the house of God or in a room full of people and we feel like we're all by &gt;&gt; ourselves. That's right. and nobody understands me. Job said, "My my my wife's breath is strange to me." You think you're the only one. And Satan will torment you and say, "See, you're not one of his. But your loyal heart, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; still beats true. He said, "All men forsook me, and I pray God." He says the exact same words that Stephen said 30 plus years ago. You ever been there? longsuffering. See, it's when people forsake you. We're not talking just about longsuffering for the grace that was given to him, but longsuffering has to be displayed &gt;&gt; in return. And when everything falls apart, I I it doesn't even I don't even think I can even I I try to wrap my mind around it that God would allow his prophet to be in a prison and he's and he's pinning the book of freedom. &gt;&gt; He's writing our pardon. in prison. See, God's that's why I say our our minds need to be rewired because we can have loyalty when it's baby blue skies and white puffy clouds. But true loyalty, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; is when the lightning flashes &gt;&gt; and the thunder rolls. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's It's when we're in that dark, damp, moldy prison house of our mind, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when loyalty shines &gt;&gt; the brightest. &gt;&gt; Because when all men are forsaking him, he looks back to where he forsook Stephen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, it's it's it's when things when we when somebody wrongs us, you need to go back into your rolodex of life and look back where you wrong somebody else. That's when you need to go back to the sea of God's forgetfulness &gt;&gt; and go I &gt;&gt; That's right &gt;&gt; done it too. &gt;&gt; That That's what That's what Paul's doing. He's saying he said that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me. in the prison house when when everybody forsook him. That's when God was the closest to him. That by me the preaching might be fully known, good and bad, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. See, it's in those it's in those dark places the it's when it's the blackest and when it's the most troubling. It's it's when we go through it's when we go through look at the Lord Jesus when when he was you think about how perfect he was. Brother Brandham says no man never could describe what it was or ever will. There God placed all divine judgment upon him and smoteed him on the side. When out of his side came water and blood and spirit for redemption. How people paint his picture sometime with a robe around him or something another or a cross. That is not so. They des dispose that despise that man and bispose of every foul fog or thing they could. But he had to be there. He was the highest and loyalist of all the world. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; That ever was or will be. And in all of that loyalty, God put him on a cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And forsook him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it has to be that way. And sometimes sometimes we go through those times in life when it's the darkest and we feel like we're being the loyalist and things go south. But the price has to be paid. It must needs be that offenses will come. &gt;&gt; And who wants them? Nobody does. &gt;&gt; But it has to be this way. God designed it for every one of his children. And there is no exceptions. When when um brother Brandham says talking about Abraham, Abraham had double test. So he said,"Abraham, take thy son, thine only son, and take him to a certain mountain where I'm going to show you and then there sacrifice him." Now what Abraham would have took a second thought? How am I going to be father of nation where I'm this old and you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that I'll have? You'll keep your word and make me a father of nation. How God loves to test his people. Every child that comes to God must be tested, child trained. No exceptions. &gt;&gt; Everyone, and maybe tonight you're sick that you're sick. Just have a little child training, just a little testing. Don't be discouraged. God on the throne. He knows all things. If we're truly born of the spirit of God, everything's working together for our good. He's going to make everything right. He promised he would. He swore he would. And he's got to keep that word. He's kept it now for oh thousands of years to every believer. Would you be an exception? No sir, we're no exception. God is obligated to his word and he's obligated to his people. Listen what brother Brandham says. I imagine some of his enemies walk around say, "Father of nation, how many children do you have? Don't make any difference how I have now. I'm a father of nation. That's all. How do you know?" God said so that sell it. So along went Abraham. You see being so loyal, more loyal. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. I think I think every one of us need to take that quote and put it on our refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I want you to think of somebody that's loyal to you. Because remember, our brains are the ones that need rewired. &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, only a prophet could say this. So Abraham more loyal. Now, if somebody's loyal to you, what are you going to do to them? You're going to patty cake them around &gt;&gt; because why? You don't want to ruin that loyalty. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You don't want to test &gt;&gt; that loyalty, &gt;&gt; because that would be cruel because they're so loyal to me, &gt;&gt; right? But that's not how God works. &gt;&gt; And that's not how God works with seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Right, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom you are. &gt;&gt; And so the more loyal you are, &gt;&gt; guess what? You get &gt;&gt; what the brother Gabe, can you read the next paragraph? Maybe by chance are you splicing tapes, brother? No. No, but remember, you are designed to be seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's how God built you. &gt;&gt; And the more loyal you are is not the more cupcake road you're going to have. Amen. &gt;&gt; But more loyal, being so loyal, more loyal, more testing. So he brought him right back. Now remember, when God has counted you worthy, when you have a test, then he says, "Now don't fail this to get this. When you have a trial or a test, it shows the grace of God has found you." Amen. &gt;&gt; You found favor. What? &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that contrary to our thinking? &gt;&gt; Because it's when the test comes and it gets real hard and dark, that's when we in our mind begin to question, God, where are you at? Brother Paul, you pray for me then. &gt;&gt; You pray for me, brother. Good. &gt;&gt; He says, "When the trial or test," he says, "you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test. When looks like everything has gone wrong, God is giving you a trial. He's got confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't have to baby you around. You're not a hot blend praying a hybrid. You're a real Christian. God has given you a test. See what you'll do about it. No wonder Peter said these fiery trials why count it all joy. It's more precious to youth than gold. &gt;&gt; And many times we hum and haw. Oh, well, if I just Well, that that's something God gave you to overcome. He knows you'll do it. He's put his trust in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's when everything you you look at you look at Daniel in the lion's den, as faithful as he was, he didn't close the windows and hide, but he opened them up and he prayed unto the Lord. And what did God do to reward him? And we would think, well, that's not fair. Why did God allow that? But brother Brandham straightens it out for us. God was sealing his ministry with a change of the king's heart. that Darius sent to every language people across the world that every man should fear of the God of Daniel because he was a God that could deliver. Amen. So you see, it's at that time when men forsake men. It's when it's the darkest and it seems like it's the most confusing. God was sealing his ministry. God was crowning his ministry. But in order for for him to come to that breaking of the day, there had to come a lion's den. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we don't want the lion's den, but we want the breaking of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's servants that stay true to the word that God seals their ministry with a crowning time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Did it look like a crowning time? &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. The same way we have to tear down our imagery of what our crowning time is, &gt;&gt; because it may be a broken down body, &gt;&gt; but a heart of faith &gt;&gt; that still beats true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. It may be a broken home and a broken family and a broken heart, but it's the fact that you get up and you dust yourself off and you conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trials. That's the crowning of your ministry. Because every one of us have a ministry. And it's not just behind this pullpit. It's every day of our lives that we can conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of the trials. We can handle ourselves not as a slave but as a son or daughter of the king. &gt;&gt; You look at Jesus and and when he was getting ready to go to his road to Calvary, you know, brother Brandham tells us this. It's so profound. He says he asked for one thing in his prayer to the father. You know what it was? One thing after all his sacrifice that he had did on the earth the life that he this is St. John 17 right before he goes to Gethsemane he says the path that he had walked he asked for one thing that where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship &gt;&gt; when the great trial was coming upon him but that loyal the loyalist of them all was beating not for himself but his heart was beating for others. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's the only thing he asked the father in the prayer, your companionship forever. If you want to read this in St. John the 24th verse, then how much should we desire him? If he desires, he says, "Now listen, if you're really born of the spirit of God, that means everything to you." See, it ain't some book of rules. &gt;&gt; You don't live any laws and so forth. You live by the grace of God &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It it's when you you know when when you think when you think of of what the Lord and his great trial and the crowning of his ministry, it it didn't look like it was a crown, but it truly was. You look at our prophet at at his great crowning, you could say, of his ministry and the the loosening of the book of redemption. You know, you know the struggles that he was going under at that time. &gt;&gt; If if you look at the timeline of his life, it before those seals in ' 63, in 1962, he was ready to go off into the mountaintops and &gt;&gt; hunting fish and because of the rejection of the people. &gt;&gt; It and you would think that was God's preparation for his prophet. He was preparing him not on a mountaintop, but he was preparing him in a valley. And you know, I I'm I'm thinking more and more as I as I look at this gospel, we we we must have our brains recalibrated. You know, when we think of sin, sin means to miss the mark, to miss the goal. That's what sin means. and and and the moment we lean to our intelligence is the moment we're missing the mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know we look so much at speaking the word and third pool and you know uh speaking to the storm and right but if you really look about it look at it for a minute I don't think the greatest part of him speaking to the storm was speaking to the storm. But I think it was after it &gt;&gt; because it was after that he spoke to the storm. &gt;&gt; He said, "I just stood there just looked around and with my hat off and I I got numb all over. I thought the very God of creation, it's all in his hands. What's he telling me?" I picked up my gun, wiped off the scope, started to walk back, go down the hill, and something said to me, "Why don't you stroll with me through the wilderness? Walk &gt;&gt; with me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, Lord, with all my heart, it would be one of the greatest things I could do was to walk with you." You know, this was before he was changed back young and Sister Mey came to him. That was after this cuz it was speaking to the storm. He walks with God and then he walks with God for a little bit and then God turns him back to a young man and we all know the story and the deers come up and but but to me this right here it's after the storm is over to me especially in this message is we want to speak the word and speak to the storms and but to me this right here is the mostant important part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not speaking so much to the storm, but really it's just walking with the Lord &gt;&gt; because that's what this purpose of God is all about. You know, brother Brandham tells us, he says, "The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had, one purpose that he wanted to achieve into the entire Bible." And all the acts of the believer in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now in the last in this last day, he has revealed it and showed it. And the three-fold in the and the goal of God, the purpose of God comes in a three-fold manner. We pastors preach on this many times, right? We all know it, right? By heart. But here's what I want you to see is ultimately the first thing that was God wanted to reveal himself express himself completely God in Christ. Secondly, to have the preeminence in his bride that he might live in people to express himself through him. Thirdly, to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam where to where he walked in the cool of Eden with his people talk with them. But what does it funnel down to? &gt;&gt; It funnels down to fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you know, here's the thing. This is this is where people that want to, you know, uh speak tumors out of existence and see squirrels created and right speak to the storm and to but but that's not the three-fold purpose of God. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of those things happened because there was a need or a necessity. It was God taking care of his children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And and and when we and when we look at that, to me, the three-fold purpose was not speaking to the storm. The three-fold purpose of God was to bring us back to fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and you know the thing of it is is people that that are wanting some uh outward emotion or outward manifestation and the latter rain of never right. I'm I'm not I I I believe in all those things. I know brother Brandham taught those. But to me, friends, you know, there's there's going to be no doubt millions that's going to come to him and said, "Have not I cast out devils? &gt;&gt; Have not I prophesied in thy name? Have Have not the blinded eyes open? Have not the right." &gt;&gt; And what's he going to say? He's going to say, "Depart from me, you worker of iniquity. I never even knew you." Right? So, so what were they missing? What they were missing was fellowship. &gt;&gt; See, it it's God above us, God with us. Now, it's God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And And listen, if if if that doesn't ring in your heart, something is wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. Something is wrong. Like like like if brother Gabe is lawing you to sleep right now, something is wrong. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this this gospel, this gospel story, if if if you're saying, "Brother Gabe, that listen, I don't even I'm I'm I'm trying to be cautious, you know, because, you know, we get we get little um catch words and catchphrases and right and and I'm not here to try to wow you with the seventh seal." &gt;&gt; Amen. But but to me, that's what I'm preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to preach it without telling you. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand where I'm coming from. This this right here that God's purpose, what he was trying to do is to bring us back into fellowship. &gt;&gt; We had to be lost because he had to express himself. There was a part of him that was to be a savior. And in order for him to express that, there had to be something that was lost. There was an attribute of healer. But he could not express it unless there was somebody that could be sick. &gt;&gt; All of those things. Look, you you know you know you know when Jesus do you know when Jesus rejoiced in spirit? You know what he rejoiced in spirit over her? in the gospels. If you look at all of his times that he expressed his emotions and you know whether he was I think brother Chad said it recently about you know he had a sense of humor and he said go tell tell Herod that fox right and brother Bham said he got a sense of humor but you know there's very few times that Jesus was happy in an outward expression in his word but he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief but but he He would he would uh he he would rejoice in spirit. And you know what he rejoiced in spirit for is because God had hid those things from the wise and repudent. But that he would reveal them to babes such as would be so. So So Jesus would rejoice when his children saw revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So So if you're struggling with God trying to I don't understand the message and it's so complex. Listen, don't don't don't in your imaginary mind think of God as some, you know, school boy kid that's tantalizing his little brother with revelation. And &gt;&gt; no, no. God rejoiced when he was on earth &gt;&gt; when one of his children saw it. What what you what we have to do is stop and and rewire our thinking and realize, wait a minute, I don't care what I feel, he rejoiced when when I when I saw revelation. &gt;&gt; And God's nature does not change. &gt;&gt; So So what I'm going through is is got to be me. &gt;&gt; It's not him, it's me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. when when look when when brother Brandham's talking about Christ the mystery of God and and he's and and he's he's uh to me this is one of the most profound quotes it just it just blows me away uh when he says these things if I could find it. Um let's see here. Yeah. He says, "But all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride. Hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery." But the bride is standing on it. That's her stand. Why do you hunger, church? Why do you thirst? It's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you. So, he's not keeping it from you. He's trying to reveal it to you. He's wanting to rejoice that you see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, I want you to say, I want you uh but you let not the devil. &gt;&gt; So, so listen, I I I'll be honest. Sometimes I feel sorry for the devil. He gets blamed. He gets blamed for so much. You got to know that. You got to be like, "I wasn't even there. What are you talking about? [Laughter] I'm serious." He gets blamed for the He like, "I God, I wasn't even there. I was on the other side of the world. It wasn't me. [Laughter] I'm so glad the prophet straightens us out. &gt;&gt; He says, "But you let so many things get it out of you." So God is trying to reveal this great mystery. You say, "Brother Gabe, I just don't understand the seven." You get Okay, calm down. &gt;&gt; Amen. cuz you let so many things get in your way. Remember, the father's trying to reveal it to you, but you let your job. Notice &gt;&gt; where's the devil in that? Where's them demons? them demon powers that made you. And and and here's here's here's the amazing thing. This I'm so glad he put this in here because there is no Budweiser in this quote. There is no Marbel man hiding behind the corner. &gt;&gt; There's no marijuana. There's no pornography in this quote. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. This is the elect of God he's realking to. &gt;&gt; This is not foolish. This quote is not for foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. This quote is for you and I. So if we have a problem with understanding or c catching the seventh seal and this mystery that's supposed to be unfolding the three-fold purpose of God and simplicity &gt;&gt; then what we need to do is we need to apply what he says and you let so many things get where is the mystery at it. He said it's in you, &gt;&gt; but you let so many things get it out of you. &gt;&gt; In other words, it don't had the preeminence that it should because God will take third place if that's all you can give him. &gt;&gt; If all you can give him is fifth place, he'll take it. But he wants first, &gt;&gt; but he won't take first. He wants you, he wants me to give it to him. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You let your wife and you let your husband and you let your children see. We All of these things are necessities &gt;&gt; and all of these things we can have scripture to back up why we have to work. &gt;&gt; Well, if I don't, I'm worse than an infidel. &gt;&gt; But no, it's not that. You have a problem with Amazon. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on, brothers. &gt;&gt; I've been trying to be good, but seriously, &gt;&gt; right? Y'all know what I'm talking about. You have a problem with your hobby, and your hobby is taking the preeminence. You say, "Brother Gabe, are you preaching?" No, stop. I'm not preaching against hobbies. Right? We're not talking about sitting in a room and um but the whole thing of it is is you have to have enough relationship &gt;&gt; relationship with God to realize I am working too much overtime &gt;&gt; and I don't have time for the Lord &gt;&gt; and you have to take inventory and realize I am trying to fix everything in the house at once. and our priorities are not in line, right? And and we have to have a 2025. Oh, we have to have the big house and we have to have the boat and we have to have and we got to have the pond and we got to have the woods and we got to have the barn and and not you. Brother Gab, you preaching against barns? No, brother John. No, no, no, brother Elmer. No. Right. These brothers need a job. But they got to build them, right? That's not my point. But my point is is we can get so caught up with things that are not sin. &gt;&gt; Right? You let your wife, we can be so tied into our family that our family becomes a hindrance. Brother Brandon would say, "I don't even express my love to my wife like I should because I don't want to mar my love for Jesus Christ." And we could say, "Yeah, but he's Malachi 4." &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying not to yell. So are you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, here we go. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, you you are you come before Elijah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's an order to it. Behold, I &gt;&gt; God send you &gt;&gt; Elijah. Elijah's last. &gt;&gt; So, so, so when, so see how we get our, we got our thinking. We got our thinking. And he says, "You let your job, you let your wife, you let your husband, you let your children, you let the cares of the world, you let some pastor, you listen, a ministry, church, we could all all these things are honorable things. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we have to take we have to work because we will be worse than an infidel. But if but if you are so consumed with your career, if you are so consumed with overtime and getting every drop and I'm guilty and we can in our mind, well, I'm just being faithful to the family. No, you're not. We're unbalanced. &gt;&gt; And then brother Gabe's falling asleep on Wednesdays. And it's not the preaching, it's the fact that brother Gabe is grinding every ounce of overtime for what? And it's not sin, &gt;&gt; but it is &gt;&gt; sin &gt;&gt; because brother Gabe and you and everybody else, all of us that's guilty, we are missing the mark. You let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're hungering, thirsting, hungry. It's God not dangling it. &gt;&gt; It's God trying to reveal it to you. See the revelation? Wh when when you look at when you look at brother Brandham and his seven church ages, what blacked out the moon? Yeah. So, the moon is you, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be separate from the world. We're supposed to live a separated life. But what was the problem in Lady Oia? The earth got in the way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of the sun shining &gt;&gt; on the church. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham just put a little sli brother go God. It was totally blacked out. But brother Brandham the prophet put a little sliver in for this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know it's I think every one of us ought to take that sliver out and give him more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if I but but if we only give him a sliver, he'll take it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you say, "Brother Gabe, I got this and I got that and I got this." And I get it. I understand. I'm not I'm not condemning you. All I'm trying to tell you is anybody ever take inventory? &gt;&gt; Right? Anybody have a job? They take inventory and they got to go into the storehouse and they got to check and I got five cans of this and four this and three bags. All I'm telling you, all I'm asking you to do, I'm not telling you nothing. All I'm asking you to do is take inventory. &gt;&gt; Because it's not God's fault that we're where we're at. &gt;&gt; It's our fault. God's trying to reveal the revelation to us, but the problem of it is is we let and and I don't want to blame the devil. I want to put blame where blame is due. &gt;&gt; And the blame rests on these shoulders, &gt;&gt; not on the devil's shoulders. They rest on mine. You know the you know the things that I I'm seeing this I hear the things in the message and you know it it's so profound to me. This message is sent to tear down our ideology. &gt;&gt; The message is sent to rewire our brains so that we don't think like normal human beings think. This message is sent so so that we don't think like normal message people think. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be I I want to be unique. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying I'm not talking about being odd, but I'm not trying to fit a cookie cutter mold. I I I I I want to just read this to you cuz to me remember this message is God in simplicity. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. I saw this last week, week before last, this before camp, before the retreat and brother Brandham, it it it just to me is so profound. Brother Brandham is getting ready to preach the greatest series that ever was preached. &gt;&gt; Do we have any other recordings, you know? 8 day services, something like that, and the book of redemption would be loosed. And in paragraph three of the opening message, Brother Brandham says this. I'm bringing you this morning greetings from my wife and my children who long to be here at this time for this dedication service and these a week of consecration to Christ. But the children are in school and it's hard to get away. He He just had seven angels come to him. He just held the king's sword &gt;&gt; and was commissioned to go back. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And loose the book of redemption by the mighty angel coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to stay at brother Bankswood's house right next door to him. So his house is empty and his wife and children stay home for school. I just let him marinate for a minute. There is I'm trying to be good, brother. Just see because in this message, people have the wrong concept of education. to me that quote right there. I have listened and read this message since 2003. And I can't tell you how many times I've listened to God hiding in simplicity. And to my shame, this just comes up. And when it did, it was like a lightning bolt in my soul because we have to rewire our thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. because I don't want I don't want my son-in-laws, if God grants me them, to have to work 60 hours a week. I don't want my daughters to have to work a job. So, in order for that to happen, what has to happen for my son-in-laws? I don't want my grandchildren to have to go to public school. So, what has to happen to my daughter? She has to be able to instruct my grandchildren. Amen. &gt;&gt; She has to explain to them algebra. And I think that prophet understood it too. &gt;&gt; I hope that quote don't make you mad, right? &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't ashamed to say it. And so if he's not ashamed to say it, I'm not ashamed to display it cuz I believe that we have to have a balance. And I don't know what the balance is, but I'm asking God, please, Lord, I just want to be balanced. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to have a a pet doctrine. And I don't want to go on a tangent. &gt;&gt; I just want to be steady and level. &gt;&gt; I want to be loyal, faithful, and true. &gt;&gt; And you know, in order to be loyal and faithful, you can't have an agenda. &gt;&gt; If if you have an agenda, loyalty takes second place. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; If if you if you have a motive, if you have a motive, you will not find the purpose of God. The Bible tells us, "But he that shall endure unto the end, and that end means the aim, the purpose, the same shall be saved." If we are to endure there has we have to check and see what our loyalty is to. I don't want it just I don't want my loyalty just to be to my family and my job and my church. But I think above all our loyalty above everything ought to be our loyalty to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "I've got my mind set on this message." That's that third pull, and it's the one I must be loyal and reverent to. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what was the attributes of of of that prophet being connected to the third p pool? Loyalty and reverence. &gt;&gt; And that's not just for him. That's for you, too. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because you you this right here, right there, you are a part of that vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was to catch that rainbow trout, that covenant fish, &gt;&gt; and that was a symbol. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the reality that I'm preaching to this morning because that it does no good to see the symbol. We have to recognize the reality. &gt;&gt; We have to recognize you &gt;&gt; are the reality that that that you are the I send you. You are the you in Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; right? that that I would love to be able to speak to the storm. But brother Brandham said that, you know, that that that that I'm going to paraphrase, but when he's referring to that, he he uh he says uh I don't know if I'll be able to find it, but but he says uh paraphrasing, he says uh that that the prophet was doing the um maybe I could find it He says he's he is trying to this is in uh he that is in you. He says he is trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through. Now that doesn't mean he has to do it to everybody. Now in the time of Moses that Moses led the children of Israel there was one that was Moses. The rest of them just followed the message. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so I I don't have to speak to the storm. All I have to do is walk with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All I have to do is hear him say, "Won't you walk with me?" &gt;&gt; And and to me, you say, "Brother Gabe, that's that." Listen, I know that people could be critical of that and uh you know, like frozen chosen, and that's fine. Uh, that's okay. But to me, I I'll stand I'll stand the ridicule. I just want to walk with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I I want to I want to keep my head above all the fanaticism that follows this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I just want to walk with him. &gt;&gt; I don't care. I I I don't I Oh, man. in my heart. God knows &gt;&gt; the voice. &gt;&gt; It It don't I I just don't want to say it brashfully. I I don't care what it costs me. it it it I just want to walk with him &gt;&gt; cuz because when we see this world where it's you know we see the world where it's at and and I to me friends if we ain't careful we can let time space and matter take the place of the preeminence of the third pool. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And and the and the the the terrifying thing is we have to live in those three dimensions. &gt;&gt; But the but the but the the test is to not those let those three dimensions take prereeminence. That's right. Amen. It's it's it's it's it's to be able to have that ability that when everything falls apart, when when we do get so caught up in the cares of this life that we have enough humility to realize, I'm missing the mark. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I I want to be loyal. &gt;&gt; I just want to be faithful to what the Lord has given in this hour. &gt;&gt; And and in all honesty, I want you to become second place. I want I want my family to be second. &gt;&gt; And as much as I love my family and you, I want him to have first place. &gt;&gt; But I let so many things take it out of me. And it's not sin, &gt;&gt; but it's sin because sin means to miss the goal, the path of right and duty. To miss the mark, to miss oneself, to lose oneself. That's the definition of sin. And if we could if we could have that definition in our mind and recalibrate our mind to not think about cell phones and iPads and &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to be a million miles down the road from that. But I believe we ought to have enough discernment and honesty and integrity in our lives to say, "God, I'm missing the mark." &gt;&gt; Yes. because I've let so many things get in the way, you know, and we'll close on this. And you know, when brother Brandon was out hunting with brother with brother Bert call lizard eyes, maybe you can stand with me. You know, brother Brandham no doubt fellowshipped and hunted with him many a time. But after all of those fishing expeditions that brother Brandham did with a rifle in his hand, cuz though he may have had a rifle in his hand, he was trying to catch Bert. and all of those opportunities that you think this is what this is what just blows my mind about God when you start thinking about how he works. God sent lizard eyes Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; over and over and over and over again. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham couldn't crack his shell. &gt;&gt; And and I have a hard time. You play something soft, brother. I have a hard time wrapping my mind around that because when people would see him, they would see God. So much so that they would baptize in his name. But Bert Call would spend no doubt hour upon hour upon hour and that prophet would say, "It wasn't a sermon I preached. It wasn't a song that was sung. It was a display of something that was so real that he seen something real. And that mother's loyalty led that man. See that mama deer wasn't playing loyalty and she wasn't playing church. She had something in her. She was born a mother. something real. And to me, God's ways are past finding out that God would use Brother Brandham in such a powerful way. But there would still no doubt be a teaching moment that that Malachi 4 would have to sit on the sidelines to a mother deer. [Music] You you wonder what he did that night in the tent when he's praying to the Lord and thinking about the day and going through his mind of all the times he threw out the line to fish for Bert and Bert just swatted away. called him a chicken-hearted preacher. [Music] And God would just wink at that [Music] because there would be an appointed time. Amen. &gt;&gt; That there would be a little deer, a mama deer, that would display loyalty. And that loyalty would be displayed in such a way that it would break that stony heart of brother Bert call and he would he would look down that scope and that scope starts shaking and his heart is trembling. And when he came to that breaking spot, he'd say, "Preacher, lead me to that Jesus Christ you've talked so much about. [Music] [Music] This message, that's that third pull. And it's the one we [Music] we must be loyal and reverent to. And I I pray and I'm sure it's your prayer. God, help us. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. [Music] Lord Jesus, [Music] truly Lord, I'm sure my brothers and sisters are in agreement as touching this one thing. We want that loyalty that was displayed. [Music] And you promised that if two would agree as touching any one thing, you'd bring it to pass. That's my heart. [Music] That's our heart's cry, Lord. Lord, we let so many things so many things take it out of the way. But Lord, we're asking this morning in the cry of our heart that you would be our helper. Lord, we just want to walk with you.

I pray that you'd help us to g the armor a little bit tighter after today. would set aside the cares of this life and [Music] we would give you the first place. Yes. Lord, we see that you would train Moses under the Egyptians for 40 years and him be a military genius [Music] and raise under the teachings of the Egyptians with a determination to be a deliverer of your people. And you would allow all of that for him to fail miserably cuz he would be an example to us as your prophet taught us that it's not by might nor by power but by your spirit. And Lord, we want that great Holy Spirit to work in our lives in a greater measure. Lord, that you'd have full sway, full reign seven days, a week, and as many nights that you would be the very forefront of our hearts and thoughts. Lord, we can't do that in ourselves, but we're asking that [Music] you'd help us to surrender to you in a greater way, [Music] Lord. That we as your people this morning would have favor with you. [Music] and that you would grant the desires of our heart. Truly Lord, we love you. We commit all we are into your hands and we ask these things to be so in Jesus lovely name. Amen. Praise the Lord.
