together precious Lord Jesus we count in the privilege Lord to once again be gathered here this evening father and together not just physically Lord but together spiritually father around the revealed truth which we know that you are and we would just ask as we would gather ourselves here and sing praises to Your Name Lord that you would just be welcome that your Holy Spirit would be pleased and that you would draw nigh Lord Jesus for we know that if you would not make an appearance here this would all be in vain Lord but we know you well Lord for you're not a man that would lie and you you said that where two or three would be gathered in My Name Lord Jesus that you would be there and father we pray that we can invoke your name here this evening to make you honor that promise not just by verbalizing the name of Jesus Christ but by portraying the character of Jesus Christ here that would make you welcome father we just ask that you would come and have the preeminence we pray that you would just come and father not just help me to minister but would you just set me aside Lord and would you Minister Lord father I I don't even want you to help me Lord I just want you to do it we just give ourselves completely over to you Lord we ask that your Divine Purpose for this service would be accomplished as we yield to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you Saints if you'll take your Bibles we're going to go to First Peter okay First Peter chapter 1 and in verse 22 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22 I heard you all how loud you were when he asked if you were happy to be back in church so I have this Revelation that I want to share with you and then I'm going to ask you that question again but the way that I have this figure is if if we miss two services you all already know where I'm going with that okay never mind just pray for me because I've got a lot here 1 Peter 1:22 seen ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever God bless you as you would have your seats here this evening um I want to take a topic Born Again by The Promised word of the hour and I've got a lot here but I I don't necessarily know how this is going to go this evening because I don't really feel to teach this um but I just want to Broach this topic and see what the Lord will do and just see if he'll speak to somebody's heart here this evening on this topic but my maybe if you want to say my inspiration for this is we know we have to be born again we know that as a spiritual principle it's the very first spiritual principle that Jesus Christ himself taught you must be born again and that's a very common phrase but what does that mean what does it mean to be born again and if we must be born again how are we to be born again and just reading in this scripture we see here Peter is addressing this that we must be born again by the word of God but what word of God like Genesis 1:1 do we read Genesis 1:1 and say that's the word of God and now I'm born again what word of God are we to be born to be born again by and if you've been around the message for any length of time we're familiar with these things I don't necessarily think that I'm going to say anything here that we haven't heard before but I just want to present this because I think a lot of times when you've been around the message for a little bit you take things things for granted and you start using cliche and catchphrases and you just assume that everybody knows what that means and now you have 8 9 10 11 12 year olds who need a new birth or even older who need a new birth and we are just throwing these catchphrases around you have to be born by the word of God well okay well what word of God what what what does that mean specifically and I am certainly not an authority on the topic but I just want to you know maybe share what's on my heart but before I do that I want to go back to verse 22 and this is a complete sidebar to where I want to go but it's I feel very impressed to say this in verse 22 it says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently and I just feel to say this this evening that the absence of hate towards your brother does not necessarily mean there is a presence of love for whoever that's for we can take that stance that I love my brother because I don't hate him and because I don't say bad things about him even though I think them and I want to I don't so therefore I love my brother the presence of hate or the presence of attacking somebody I'm sorry the lack of the that presence the lack of the presence of hate towards that individual or the lack of the presence of attacking that individual that is still a far cry from unfeigned love of the Brethren Amen brother random makes a comment that if you have ought in your heart against any sinner any person sinner or saint that you are in danger of Hellfire so for anybody that thinks maybe we get a little too deep into stuff tonight there's just some just real simple stuff an unfeigned love of the brother a pure heart and now even magnifying that not just towards a brother or a sister but if you have a in your heart go look up the definition of what odd is it might not be what you think it's not a real big thing if you have awe in your heart against a sinner or a saint you're in danger of Hellfire I believe that that is the purpose of the topic we're about to discuss I believe that is well I don't it's not just my belief the scripture says that that is the end of the Commandment unfeigned love out of a pure heart that is the that's the purpose of the Gospel that's the purpose of the message you can't get to that point without the word of God it is humanly impossible to get to that point but I believe that's what this message has come to do I've said it multiple times and I'll probably say it multiple more times but brother brother brandom says this is a free age that we live in a free age and that's my my favorite description of this age because that means I don't have to be bound by anything I can choose to be bound if I want to be if you want to be bound by false Doctrine you can be if you want to be bound by a bad attitude you can be if you want to be bound by ought in your heart you can be but you don't have to be there has literally come a word literally came a word to free us from anything that is not like Christ so if we choose to accept anything that's not like Christ that's not his fault he has given us the pure word amen back to my subject being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever in the token brother brandham says every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves for a minute how many wants to check themselves here tonight on the Wednesday night we want to check ourselves for a moment when God has give you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you so now we have a definition of the true baptism of the Holy Spirit equal sign the Life of Christ is now in you now that's true and every Theologian will have to admit that to be yes sir it's the new birth another equal sign Holy Spirit equals Life of Christ in you equals New Birth so now we can start defining some of these things we don't want to leave here tonight with these just being catchphrases and um you know cliches we want to have a foundation and a settl in our heart we know what we're after here the scripture says where there's no vision the people perish so we want to have a Clear Vision so that we know what we're after and that we do not perish he says yes sir it's the new birth you are born a new of the Holy Ghost Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandom says they're asking him the question well brother brandom what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's right another definition these are super important another definition Jesus Christ revealed personally to you equal sign Holy Spirit equal sign New Birth equal sign token amen not that you joined a church not that you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed or promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you I thought you said it was Jesus Christ personally revealed to me and now he says it was the word that was revealed to you amen equal son 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus the cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost 1 John 4 1-3 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophet prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that that confesseth that Jesus Christ is com in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and that is the spirit of antichrist wherefore ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world this was thousands of years ago and and John is saying this is already working where do you think that's at now news flash for you Satan does not care what you believe he does not care what experience you have if you come within a hair a whisker and still fall short of believing Jesus Christ is come in my flesh he does not care right furthermore he will allow you to believe those things cuz he does not care because the scripture says that is the spirit of antichrist the spirit of antichrist is not to say Jesus Christ doesn't exist the spirit of antichrist is to say Jesus doesn't exist now yeah here there amen that's right he does not care how close we come remember brother brandom said that um 3,000 was added to the kingdom and Satan never never even he he I can't remember what he said but he basically he didn't blink but he saw Peter and John meet the guy at the gate beautiful and raise him up and realize that Jesus Christ is coming the Flesh and he had a big problem the difference two men compared to 3,000 he didn't care about what their confession was he didn't care about what their experience was what he cared about was when he saw Jesus Christ is now in the flesh again the scripture says that every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is coming the flesh is not of God that every also includes a preacher if a preacher is preaching anything other that then that Jesus Christ is now currently coming the flesh scripturally speaking that is an antichrist spirit amen regardless if it's reading message quotes or not this this is the scriptural Plum line either we're preaching Jesus Christ is come in the flesh and we're preaching the true unadulterated word of God or we're short changing that we're coming short of that and we're taking an antichrist spirit I don't want to be found on the wrong side of that line I want to say that he is coming the flesh I want to say that verbally and I want to say that with my life the scripture tells us that's how we can discern the spirits it's not going to be just a scary criminal that's anti- word Antichrist it's going to be a spirit that would confess anything other than that Christ can come in your flesh right now amen that's the plum line Colossians 1:25 says wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God I want you to notice a couple things and I'm really going to emphasize this as we go on but Paul speaking here says wherefore I am made a minister how many doubts Paul was a minister Minister we can all agree Paul was a minister no problem with our faith Paul was a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me do we believe that God gave him a dispensation to fulfill we're all comfortable with that Paul is Paul Paul is the first church age messenger he was ordained of God but now there's a change was given to me for you wherefore Paul was made a minister according to the dispensation that God had given him for me amen for me well Paul had this Vindication and that Vindication and what do I have how how do I know that that's me the same way Peter knew this was the Christ the son of the Living God Amen a direct Revelation from God himself is the only way that you can put you in that scripture It Go goes on to say to fulfill the word of God so let's back up and read it again wherefore I Paul am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me Paul for you to fulfill the word of God amen yeah Paul fulfilled the word of God he did a great job no you're reading that wrong Paul says I was giving everything that I was giving for you to fulfill the word of God even it gets better even the mystery how many believes Paul preached a mystery even the mystery which had been which hath been hid from ages and from Generations now we have to back up so we don't get confused Paul is saying I was a minister I was given something by God to give to you so you could fulfill the word of God semicolon even the mystery so I have a question for you is this mystery he's speaking about is this a doctrinal teaching or is this a people to fulfill the word of God who fulfills the word of God when they write it in a book somewhere and publish it to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints it's easy to identify Paul in that scripture is it not but that's not the point that's not the main point of the scripture the main point even as Paul is declaring is to understand I've been given something for you and now this mystery that I'm going to talk about is going to be manifest in his saints Saints are people amen amen amen not just letters verse 27 to whom people people again to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles Gentiles are people and just in case we aren't picking up on what he's putting down he clarifies it which is Christ in you the hope of glory this transition is the same transition that we have to come to and we're going to touch on that just here in a little bit questions and answers 1964 brother brandom says there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that I know of and that is genuine faith in the promised word of the hour we're all familiar with this only one evidence so we can take any other ideas we have any other teachings we have and we can get rid of them because there's only one evidence amen of the holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour I would think we could all say Amen to that we can all say we agree with that my next question is what is the promised word for the hour amen this is where brother BR says we need to check ourselves we can say Amen to the catchphrase we can say Amen to the cliche but if that evidence of the holy spirit in my life is only one thing and that one thing is genuine faith in the promised word of the hour I not only need to make sure that I have genuine faith in the promised word but I need to find out what the word for the hour is right cuz it's easy to say I have faith in the genuine word and I would never take that away from anybody I would never do that but my question is it doesn't stop there what is the word for your hour amen you say well why is that important 1965 God's only provided place of worship if I taught you a Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses's message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed how many believes you're a predestinated seed because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's given for that seed that's right we know this principle in nature certain seeds come up at certain times they require certain things they have to be in certain locations it's not enough for that seed to scream and holler and Shout that he's a seed nobody's doubting that you're a seed but we're not called to just be seeds we're called to manifest and fulfill the word of God am so in order to come to what we are to be and have the evidence that we need we have to have the correct word the the word for our hour bring that specific seed to life again these are principles that we've been taught these are things that we have heard said but I'm just hoping and trusting that if I say it for the 225 millionth time that it'll ring with somebody I might as well just go there it's on my heart amen I've heard things throughout my walk within the message and I've heard it multiple times of that we've got to get people to Christ and then get them to the message we've got to make sure that people get to Calvary before we get them to the message my question is are they right or is the prophet right amen because the prophet said that the predestinated seed for this hour will only come to life and be watered by the water that's given for that specific seed for that specific time for that specific hour the promised word for that hour amen so if we are in this hour yeah and and we preach Calvary to somebody and they accept accept it are they bride these are hard questions these are uncomfortable statements to make because who in the world would want to be guilty of making light of calvary or detracting from of C Calvary I'm nervous just saying those things but we have have to come to terms with these with these truths amen if the death on Calvary was enough why did christ have to rise good right so if you just preached that Christ died on the cross and paid the penalty for your sins okay again far be it for me to ever detract anything from that but what if you don't tell him that he rose again are they okay what if we tell him that he rose again but we don't tell him anything about the promise that he made that he would come and be in US yeah right amen at what point in time are we presenting that seed with the word of the hour amen right the same thing applies now the word of the hour was not what happened two thou not just what happened 2,000 years ago can you preach this message without preaching Calvary absolutely not can you preach that brother the Brandon says he bled and died so that we could have this message right can you preach this message without the fact of preaching the resurrection that he came forth from the grave absolutely not can you preach this message without invoking the promise that he says I will not leave you comfort comfortless but I will come to you and I will be with you and even in you absolutely not but I take issue with the people that think I won't say people with the doctrine that think this is something new or that we're trying to do something new or change things in the scripture Paul himself said let us leave the principles of Christ amen I'm just going to read it praise the Lord it was the next thing in line therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection amen was Paul detracting from Calvary I feel the tension in the air these are tough questions I'm sure you all have been part of these conversations but it's time we deal with it it's time we know where we understand that as brother brand said it's time we check ourselves it's time we know if we're going to say that we preach the message of the hour it's time we know what the message of the hour is therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ what was the doctrine of Christ you were lost you needed a savior a savior come paid the price rose again and sent his Spirit Back To You Paul says let us leave that Doctrine now now let's define leave do you think Paul is saying let's never preach that again let's not talk about that again it's like the scripture that says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with does that mean we just throw all that word to the side we don't need that anymore no it's just saying that is not the Focus right now when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with is not that we W it up and throw it in a trash can is we simply recognize we have more yeah and we have moved in time and we have moved in dispensations and now in order to not be Antichrist and not not be preaching Jesus Christ is coming the flesh we must move forward amen we must preach something new this is what Paul is saying leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment that's a lot of topics to preach on and Paul's saying we've discussed that we've taught that and that's not going to bring you to perfection yeah let's go amen we have something else to talk about so that's not a new discussion I'm sure there were people in Paul's age that was like oh who whoa whoa whoa whoa let's not get carried away here right but that spirit is real that spirit is so real that I'm fighting it right now just saying these things are we just going to continue to sweep it under the rug or are we going to check ourselves and know where we stand are we going to keep avoiding those conversations or are we going to check ourselves and know what the promised word for the hour is and know that it's okay to say that we've moved past Calvary is it okay to say that is it okay to say that we've furthered past the resurrection of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago is it okay to say that we have moved past the baptism of the Holy Spirit and are now walking in the person of Christ himself you don't have to answer just think about it that's all I'm asking you to do is think about it I'm not asking you to jump up and down and scream hallelujah it's uncomfortable but let's face the fact that it's uncomfortable and let's find out what we can do to know where we stand so that it's not uncomfortable I'm going to keep keep talking about it until it leaves I'm sorry the reason I have a problem with that is it keeps our young people young people from coming to a new birth am yeah we might not go any further tonight but I've got a problem with that spirit and that's why I've got a problem with it is because brother brandom says the deception in this age is to make Satan has come to make you think you're saved when you're not right that's the deception for this age amen so how do we combat that deception for this age we can only combat that with the pure word of God for this hour amen and the pure word of God for this hour is not just that Jesus Christ died on a cross 2,000 years ago and that he Resurrection resurrected and that he sent his holy spirit back if you are living in this chronological time that is not the only message for your age the message for your age is that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh your flesh Perfection we're not living in a justification age if we were living in Luther's age it would be okay just to preach that the penalty has been paid and faith in that penalty suffices if we were living in Wesley's age it would be okay just to preach to believe that the penalty has been paid and faith in that penalty can now bring me to a Sanctified life if we were living in a Pentecostal age it would be okay to believe that the restoration of the baptism of the Holy Spirit has been restored but you don't live in that age therefore if you come short of preaching and believing and living that Jesus Christ is now come in your flesh not in partiality in the fullness the fullness of the word that has returned and that is now living in my flesh we've come up short amen and it's e easy for the young people to go down and start checking the boxes yeah I believe he died yeah I believe he resurrected yeah I believe he sent his Spirit but what about is he living in your flesh what about Jesus Christ is literally walking the Earth in this age and in this day and time in my flesh that's the promised word of the hour amen I'm not saying you're going to come to that overnight and I'm not saying you don't need to go through a process I'm just saying as Paul said let us leave leave is not forsake it leave is meaning let's move forward right let's move forward let's keep going not forsaking those things I mean how silly would it be to get to the end of the road and say I believe the message of the of the hour and that Jesus Christ is living in My Flesh and then you show up and be like well I don't even believe there was a penalty paid for my sins I believe all this I mean that doesn't even make good sense if there's not a penalty paid for me as a sinner I'm toast it doesn't matter what I believe but the the age the day and the age that I live in requires something more and this has always been the argument this has always been the argument back over time remember remember what they confronted Jesus with he's trying to further the kingdom of God to them and reveal to them who he is Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh and they say we've got Moses amen see young people Satan is not going to come to you and say you don't have no experience at all he's going to come to you and make you justify your present condition and I assure you he's not going to encourage you to move forward into Jesus Christ is now come in my flesh the reason I'm laboring on this is I don't want to be guilty because if in my heart I have a burden and a cry not just for the young people but anybody under the banner of this message to come to the fullness of its potential if I have that burden how can I leave them in a present condition that is short of the full word of God for the hour amen I hope this is making sense to somebody how can we want our children to be borned again but we won't give them the full word to be born again and the full present tense word is always uncomfortable it always has been uncomfortable if we want new births how many want new births how many have a burden for new births not just your own but if you have been born again for others for our children if we if we have that burden and we want that result we have to water that seed with the right water and put it under the right conditions and the right conditions is preaching the right right word over top of it am and that will never come to fruition preaching a past tense gospel right and again I'm not saying that we we bypass any of the fundamental steps of our faith I think you all know me better than that but we we as the prophet says he said Pentecost cabbage down on the baptism of the Holy Spirit really the baptism of the Holy Spirit they cabbage down on it I mean what a thing to cabbage down on I thought if I had the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'd be okay but he said that not me prise God so if you can cabbage down on the baptism of the Holy Spirit can you not cabbage down on justification and on sanctification right and on God sent a prophet for this age and whatever I believe everything he said we so easily make these statements but do you even know what he said we can make a statement I believe everything that he said really what you're doing is just admitting that he is the authority and that's fine like that's step number one we got to get past that a lot of people haven't but just saying I believe everything that he said recognizing him as the authority and not knowing what he said to apply it to your life does that really do you any good there's going to be a lot of people on Judgment Day not arguing who the author it for this age was Satan's going to be right there with them Satan knows God sent a prophet yeah Satan knows who the Authority for this age was is that the promised word for the hour then I'm not trying to be dogmatic on it but I've just seen it for too many years this message is Christ amen he bled and died for this message if he bled and died for this message which did he feel was more important amen right so why would we be ashamed to say that we've come past the penalty that was paid he's the one himself who said that's more important I'm going to lay my life down for it right would it not be an insult to him to just say we're going to stay here we're going to stay here and preach the penalty's been paid the penalty's been paid the penalty's been paid and you know what that's equivalent to that's equivalent to going to the pawn shop giving the guy the $100 for whatever it is you pawned and then been like see you later that's right the price has been paid you've still got to take it you've got to claim it which was more important the $100 or the item that you gave the $100 for that's right this is the same principle and I've got the prophet to back it up he says not Calvary was the most Sublime portion of scripture but Revelation 55 was the most Sublime portion of scripture why because he knew the principle the price has been paid but if you don't take that which you've paid for why pay the price for it that's right why leave it in the pawn shop I don't want to be guilty I don't want to be guilty of not preaching the most Sublime portion of scripture and saying that that is the word for the yah and that anything short of that is Antichrist that's what the scripture says anything short of Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of an antichrist Spirit they're still going to be preaching some type of Christ and when I say they I'm not speaking of any certain individuals I'm saying the spirits the 200,000,000 demons that were released they're not going to come to you message kids young people with Gothic Doctrine I'll tell you what Doctrine they're going to come to you with is that you're okay just the way you are don't go any farther certainly don't go poking around in the Book of Revelation and seeing that there's been a book to claimed and certainly don't believe that you're that book and certainly don't believe that that was the whole purpose that the seventh angel was sent the purpose of that was you could say he's the seventh angel whatever he says is correct and if you live it okay if you don't just say it's correct if we want new births out of our children we better give them them the promised word for the hour if we want new births under our ministry we better preach the promised word of the hour if we don't preach the promised word of the hour we find oursel being Antichrist preaching a Christ but not Jesus Christ that's my burden if we want want something we have to meet the requirement for that even if it's uncomfortable we've got to be comfortable telling our children and our young people then anything short of perfection is not the message of the hour anything short of Jesus Christ himself revealing himself through your being is not the message of the hour amen do we detract from anything that's happened absolutely not but we can't have a burden for something and want something and not be able to tell the truth just because somebody might not understand or somebody might be offended don't do it in an offensive way if you're doing it to be offensive you're wrong in the first place but we can't detract from the promised word of the hour and expect the promised word of the hour to be manifested in our lives or anybody else's lives praise the Lord sorry Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things in verse 11 there's two things in there I'm sorry two subjects in there and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias how many knows who the Elias was if you don't that's okay I'll tell you it was brother branam and Jesus answered and said unto them the ministry of brother brandham the seventh angel Elijah truly shall first come but there's an end there and restore all things so is the promised word of the hour Elias shall truly first come or is the promised word of the hour Elias truly shall first come and restore all things cuz it's easy to believe that Elias came it's easy to believe that He restored all things what's hard to believe is those things that He restored one of those things is not just a Doctrine but one of those things is me that's the promised word for the hour say I'd like some more backup for that I'm glad you ask Luke 1:34 then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing that I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing that thing was a person I'll remind you what shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so did Elias Truly Come absolutely he did did he restore all things only you can answer that it's not going to change whether Elias came and restored all things to me or should I say restored me that that Revelation is not going to change but I hope it'll change in you if you don't see yourself there when it says that He restored all things and not just make that a doctrinal teaching I remember when I first caught this if I'm so way off my notes I might as well just tell you a story anyhow am I worked at Columbia Forest Products in Craigsville West Virginia I was probably 20 years old I'm working on the blank press operation midnight shift 600 to 6 don't recommend that I'm having a conversation with a man cuz he asked me what I believe and you know I'm 20 years old I got the World by the tail I got everything figured out I start laying scriptures on him just I mean we got two hours before we go to our next break so like he got it all Malachi 4 Revelation 10 right on down the list about the cloud about the coming about the seals being open I go through all of this I don't know how long it was but I'm going to say it was probably well over an hour I'm sure you all have trouble believing that you know what this man did when I got to the end of that and I told him that Christ had come in 1963 and there was a cloud to verify that and his pict picture was taken you know what he had the audacity to ask me that's really interesting where's he at now he didn't even not believe everything that I had just told him and about the cloud and everything okay that's neat that's interesting I'll go with that so he was in the cloud where's he at now it was the worst question Satan could allow him to ask you have those moments in your life you know they say everything goes into slow motion tunnel vision and all that I'll tell you what happened according to what brother Brandon said something fell out of a mystical channel for me something came tumbling down through a mystical Channel and this man asking me this question suddenly sparked a revelation in me and I caught I can show you where he's come and I can't show you where he left which means he has to be somewhere here yeah amen now I'm not saying that I had a full spectrum of Revelation on the subject but it was the worst question Satan could allow that man to ask because I started 2 plus 2 equals 4 kind of thing and I quickly realized that up to that point I had been preaching to that man where Jesus was past tense not where he was present tense you know what happened when he asked me that and everything went into slow motion and I caught this Revelation like I don't know how long it took it couldn't have been but seconds but it seemed like an eternity I had the answer to his question he's in his people right I mean that's progress I still wasn't up to he's right here but I at least could acknowledge he's in his people there's been some growth take place there's been some word open up since then now if I'm ask that question I can just Clearly say he's right here you might not like that you might have trouble seeing that some days I do too but it doesn't change the Revelation it doesn't change the Revelation and the word for this hour that he is right here amen you know what happened after I told the man that he's in his people he didn't have any more questions that was the end of the conversation cuz there is no more questions after Jesus Christ is come in the flesh there may be some doctrinal misunderstandings there may be some more knowledge gained but the answer to the question as brother brandom says we have the answer to the question I'm just going to go a little bit further and we're going to close because there's no way that I'm going to make it through all of this Malachi 45 very familiar behold I who is the ey we all know this is God behold I God will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Elijah the prophet shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse how many have a problem identifying brother brandham as the Elijah in that good it's easy to identify yep that applied to brother brandham right there Malachi 4:5 that's brother brandham who's the you amen and which is the promised word for the hour because the prophet's not here anymore does that mean we do away with the prophet but are we going past the prophet are we leaving the prophet leaving in a scriptural sense he's not here Saints but even that comment going past the prophet leaving the prophet you all can sense that too let's deal with that let's not sweep it under the rug why can't we comfortably say we've went past the prophet not that we've left the prophet but we have went past the prophet I assure you if he was here and we were still preaching just the prophet he would have a problem with us he gave his life not on a cross but he gave his life for that Ministry he surrendered to that Ministry why so that we could go past the Revelation that God sent a prophet and come to a revelation of who this you is in ch in verse five it would be an insult to his ministry if we would skip that and just say behold I will send Elijah the Prophet no the scripture says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet which is more important the you or the Elijah if he's sending the Elijah for you and who are these children in verse six right who are these children Joel 2:23 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will come he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm many the great Army which I sent unto you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfi satisfied and praise the name of the Lord for your of your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed who's the children of Zion how many believes that the Lord will restore how many believe the Lord hath restored who are these children of Zion though it's easy to say yeah he'll restore he'll fix things he'll build back the bride tree but who's the bride tree am amen who's the children of Zion I will restore to you who is this you here it says my people shall never be ashamed if you run that back we won't take time through but you'll link ashamed is most of the time linked to nakedness my children my people will not be naked and my people will not be naked why won't we be naked why won't we be ashamed because he's restored restored what what are we clothed with the promised word for the hour I wonder if we so easily read over the most important parts of the scripture which is more important a revelation about somebody else's position in the scripture or a revelation about your position in the scripture right you say Well they're both important you're right it's just one's more important to you and one's more important to the other person Eliah Elijah's Revelation you know brother brandom didn't come out of the womb knowing he was Malachi 45 there was a revelation that had to take place and one day he had to come to terms with the fact that that Elijah in Malachi 4:5 was him yeah right one of these days we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that that Elijah that was sent in Malachi 4:5 was to me brother let me ask you this and maybe this will ease some tension did Brother Brandon's Revelation that he was Elijah in Malachi 4:5 detract from your Revelation that you're the children in Malachi 4:5 like do you have a problem with him saying this part's me and this is more important to me no that's him yeah how could we be upset that that's more important to him he's identified himself in the scripture do you think brother Brandon would come along and be like I would much rather you see that I'm in that scripture than you are in that scripture how silly this is but why is it so uncomfortable when it comes up in conversation I say we don't let it be uncomfortable anymore I say we know where we stand we preach the pure word of God for the hour and we let the chips fall where they may not in a not in a nasty way not in an offending way if anything do it as most unoffending as you can as Paul says so that I might win one to Christ amen amen so take the soft approach first you know the they say in the business world the best leaders and the most powerful people is the ones who have a great idea and then convince you it was your idea I wonder if we preach the gospel that way if we wouldn't get better results I wonder if I preach the gospel that way if I wouldn't get better results maybe have a revelation and lay it out instead of running it down somebody's throat to where they pick it up and see what I wanted them to see and come preach it to me like I don't see it and then have the humility to be like that's wonderful and not tell them that I already knew that I want wonder if that approach wouldn't work a little bit better as the musicians come please Luke 17 we're very familiar with this and when it was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you and he saith unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lith out of one part under Heaven shineth into the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day don't get hung up on this terminology I don't have time to teach you here tonight when you see son of man that is Christ in his fullness in flesh verse 30 we're very familiar with this even th so now he's prophesying he's moving from present tense to future tense even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed how many have heard this scripture before even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed how many have no trouble believing that we live and have lived in the days of the son of man but there's another word in there revealed the son of man in the day when the son of man is revealed does the son of man need to reveal himself to himself on that means this Revelation incorporates another another people how many times have we been guilty of reading Luke 17:30 and saying that's brother brandom's Ministry and forgetting the people that's under that word revealed right there which is the present word for the day what is the present word for the hour what will bring the seeds that are laying here that need to come to a new birth to life telling them that God sent a prophet telling them that we lived in the days of the son of man or telling them that the son of man is revealed in your flesh and in my flesh you say my 8-year-old can't handle that I say try it I say try it they made just be so naive and un indoctrinated that they might just believe it the first time you tell them because the seed is predestinated for the word of the hour the seed can't help itself I'll tell you one Surefire way not to let that 8-year-old know who he or she is is not tell them that Jesus Christ is coming the Flesh and that we're still living in the days of the son of man and this revealed right here in verse 30 that revealed speaks of me because he has revealed the son of man has revealed himself to me there's two people in that sentence not just one verse 37 and they answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is tither will the E Eagles be gathered together who's the body wheresoever the body is the body the body word of the son of man wherever that is there's going to be some Eagles there how many times have we read Luke 17 and checked the Box beside brother brandham and we forgot who it was revealed to and who these Eagles were and bypassed the present word for the hour brother Brant I'm not just making these things up Saints brother brandom says in what in the attraction what is the attraction on the mountain he says these things that we talked about years ago speaking sir what time it is is it and and the seals and the Thunders he says these things that we spoke about a few years ago are now history if those things are now history how can those things be the present word for the hour not not that they do not are not incorporated into the present word for the hour does that make sense are we comfortable with that are we comfortable saying that the seventh angel is history he said it his ministry his regular Commission in what is the attraction on the mountain he said Is Now history so what's the presid word for the hour the purpose the people for which it came to and which it came for and what will bring a new birth in this hour telling them that the seals were preached that the son of man did come that God did send a prophet absolutely we got to lay a foundation but what's going to make that seed that's predestinated for this hour come to life Jesus Christ is coming the Flesh and this is how he came this is the channel that he used these are the tools that he used but the purpose for the penalty being paid the purpose for the Resurrection the purpose for the holy spirit being sent back the purpose for Luther coming and preaching justification the purpose purpose for Wesley catching light and preaching sanctification the purpose for the restoration of the baptism of the Holy Spirit the purpose of that is so that we could come to Perfection that we could be Jesus Christ is come in the flesh if we preach everything except for the purpose what are we preaching if we preach everything and miss the purpose and miss the people of that purpose what have we gained if we preach everything but Don't Preach Jesus Christ is come in the flesh how do we expect new births for a predestinated seed sitting amongst us who is only predestinated for the word Jesus Christ is come in the flesh let's Stand Together if we want something we have to speak the word for that something the appropriate word for that something I'm just going to stop because if I don't I'll keep going and then we'll be here way late I apologize if it was a bit quiet and maybe sobering and maybe rough I assure you what I had in mind was not what I just did but that's what's on my heart Saints I don't mean it to be offensive I don't mean it to I don't mean it to be any other way than just a help and I hope that you can see through the rough parts and the parts that aren't maybe kosher and just see my heart that there's people that need a new birth and it's not just enough to tell them they need a new birth there's people that need a new birth and they need the word for the hour preached to them not the word for a past hour we need the word for the past hour in the present hour we need it all because that's the position we've been called to we can't preach a gospel like any other ages preach the gospel because there's no other age been in the position we've been in with the full word restored amen amen we would never detract from the ages of partiality it would be silly for us to do that because we understand now why they preached the way they preached and what they preached but they preached everything in the fullness that they could but now that we've come to an age of fullness how silly it would be to say that partiality will be okay we have to preach the fullness and the fullness is not going to be accepted and liked by those who just want partiality and by like I said I'm not I'm not speaking people I'm speaking Spirits so this is not an attack against anybody or any minister or church or anything this is just an attack on that spirit because remember what the deception is for this age to make the people believe they're okay when they're not and that doesn't mean that we have to live in fear and that we have to live in uncertainty cuz we have the answer amen we can believe we're okay and be okay amen just because you believe you're okay doesn't mean you're deceived that is the deception though yeah for anybody trying to get to the new birth to trying to have a new birth to trying to come to the word for their hour is Satan is going to try to make you think you've arrived that you're okay when you're not the only thing that I know to do to combat that is continually tell you what the correct word for the hour is not the word for another age with the word for this age let's pray together Lord Jesus father I pray that you would come here this evening Lord and just do something Supernatural father and take the words that I've spoken and somehow let the people see what you placed in my heart to deliver Lord father it's obviously been completely different of how I thought it would transpire Lord but I just commit myself to you Lord and I just pray that you would accomplish here in spite of me Lord that you would accomplish here what you needed to accomplish Lord and I pray that you have come and spoken to hearts that need to be born again under the word for this hour and revealed to them Lord what that word is and that it is attainable and not only is it attainable but if were your children were predestinated to it Lord may you just continue to reveal yourself to us may you bring a birth to those that need a birth and may you bring growth to those that need growth because I believe we can all say with an honest heart we fall in one of those two categories I pray that you would have accomplished both here tonight Lord we just Commit This service to you for your glory and for your purpose in Jesus Christ's name the bride says amen God bless you Saints let's sing a song brother give me more Revelation let my flesh be all forsaken that the word of God guide me on my way so he can have prence each day give me more Let My Life be your reflection for I know this word is my Redemption give me more [Music] reel man I was thinking as brother Ben was preaching there at the end that you remember brother B's story of the eagle in the chicken yard the eagle in the chicken yard had already heard denominational clucking but it didn't wake him up to who he really was it heard a lot of clucking and heard a lot of noise and heard a lot of bird sounds he was in the bird family and he was around Birds but one day an eagle screamed and the eagle scream reflected something that was inside of him and only the eagle scream could wake him up to who he really was am that's what the true revelation of this message is it's the eagle scream to Eagles a lot of clucking a lot of noise a lot of things we've heard but only an eagle scream will bring an eagle to a revelation of who it is I thank God for a message that screamed like an eagle and something inside it wasn't something that was taught but there was an automatic reaction yes that that sounds right am to me amen I was also thinking when I just had this thought there in my seat do you remember brother M tells the story about the Welsh Revival it was an amazing Revival that broke out in in the area uh uh and it was the Welsh Revival there in England and some people a delegation from America wanted to come and learn about the Welsh Revival they might have wanted to know where it was taking place and what doctrines they were teaching and how they structured themselves so they were sent over to learn about the W Revival and they were looking for where the Revival was taking place and you all know the story they came in contact with a little police officer there whistling a song and Swinging his baton and they asked him good man could you tell us where the W Revival is he said certainly he said I am the Welsh Revival I think he had a revelation of what the Welsh Revival was all about right it was an Awakening to him it was a life that came to him amen can we say the same thing about the message if somebody says can you show me where the message is what is the message listen the message is that God was restoring his people back to that right relationship back to Sons and Daughters of God so that he can manifest himself completely in his people again on the earth so where is the message it's not in a building and it's not in a book am the message is in a people it is a people amen it's coming to perfection that's the Revelation that that little policeman he caught the revelation of the weal Revival not over here something's happening and these were the signs and these were the things that happen and this was the newspaper report on it and this is what was taught that that he caught what the Welsh Revival was he was the Welsh Revival God helped me to catch what this message is help us all to catch what this message is and may God help us in all that we say and all that we do may it be a true Eagle scream whenever we talk to somebody cuz that's the only thing that'll wake up an eagle to what it is amen God bless you how many's heard an eagle scream amen and it resounded inside remember brother R tells the story the little boy goes to his aunt's house and never seen a mirror before and all of a sudden he goes up the steps and he sees a mirror and he moves in the little boy moves and all of a sudden he understands that that's me brother B does the same thing with this Bible when the words revealed all of the sudden you see that that movement there and that character there and the way brother that what brother B's talking about that's me amen that word that he's talking about at the end time that's me it's not somebody else it's not other people it's me Mama it's me oh God give us that Revelation that this message it's about me because that's the true Revelation that'll carry us let's bow our heads together and thank the Lord for his word Lord Jesus we thank you for this word God I pray that you would help us Lord to stay true to this message you've given us and may our Revelation grow to where we' even understand what it is we hold within us that it become more alive and more real and that we'd be able to share it in its fullness Lord that we would be able ourselves to move Beyond a partial realization but even in our own Revelation that you would open our eyes to see the reality all around us and may that reality Lord be on display and may it be you not us God and may God May the revelation of that strike others Hearts God I pray that you would just begin to move in our lives and bring us higher and higher Revelation by Revelation and Lord May May the eagle scream continually be going forth may it come in Purity as we recognize more and more what it is you're doing and what you've been trying to do all along may we speak it and preach it with more clarity than ever before and may it bring life to all of your seed Lord anything that's laying there Lord still waiting to hear their Scream God May that scream go forth and give us Lord a mouth that's yielded to you so that you can speak through us what is true and what is right and the words that bring life we love you we ask that you would bless our brother Benjamin Lord that you would restore strength to him and fresh inspiration and Lord that you would bless us that we would go thankful and grateful for what we've heard but also Lord intent to be true to this Revelation more true than ever before and may we speak it with more truth more clarity more Revelation than we ever have God we pray you'd bring all your seed to a birth we love you we ask that you'd bless us as we part keep your people safe along the way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen give me more [Music] reel let my flesh be all forsaken that the word of God guide me on my
