[0:00] I want to be
[0:01] right and I want to be
[0:04] honest and I want to be
[0:07] true and I want to filter everything
[0:09] that I go through through God's Eternal
[0:11] Word but we have to be mindful of what
[0:15] am I filtering my thoughts
[0:18] through because if we ain't careful we
[0:21] we we'll have a slave
[0:23] mentality and it won't equal
[0:27] Liberty it'll always equal bondage
[0:30] I'm not good enough they're better than
[0:33] me why do they get the Revelation why do
[0:36] they I never
[0:42] understand
[0:44] see that's not that that is not here to
[0:48] edify you you need to tear that filter
[0:52] down and you have to take what God's
[0:55] word says about you God's word says
[0:58] you're beautiful God's word says you are
[1:04] his but but if but if you ain't careful
[1:07] you end up falling
[1:10] under the B look the Bible tells us but
[1:13] now after that you have known God or
[1:15] rather known of God how turn you again
[1:17] into the weak and beggarly elements
[1:19] where unto you desire again to be in
[1:24] bondage so so so we can be known of God
[1:27] but we can go through this Valley and we
[1:30] can go right back and instead of going
[1:32] into the promised land we turn around
[1:35] and we go right back to
[1:37] Egypt in
[1:40] our
[1:44] minds no alcohol right no
[1:49] drugs no filth but just bondage that's
[1:55] right you know there's a story told one
[1:58] time about about the great mus uh
[2:02] magician Harry
[2:05] Houdini and Harry Houdini made a
[2:08] challenge one day that there wasn't a
[2:10] jail sale in the country that could hold
[2:13] him and there was a local sheriff that
[2:15] took him up on the
[2:21] offer and so Harry Houdini stepped in
[2:24] that jail
[2:25] cell the sheriff closed the
[2:28] door and old Harry started
[2:32] picking
[2:34] minutes turned to
[2:37] hours hours turned into
[2:42] exhaustion and when Harry Houdini came
[2:45] to his last
[2:48] effort in
[2:51] defeat he leaned against the
[2:54] door exhausted and
[2:58] broken and the door door
[3:04] opened see the door had been unlocked
[3:07] the whole
[3:10] time Harry Houdini was a prisoner in his
[3:14] own mind and of his own
[3:18] making and I'm preaching to you this
[3:21] morning that there is a
[3:24] release there is a
[3:27] jubilee it's a reality
[3:30] and if you want to go
[3:32] free you can
