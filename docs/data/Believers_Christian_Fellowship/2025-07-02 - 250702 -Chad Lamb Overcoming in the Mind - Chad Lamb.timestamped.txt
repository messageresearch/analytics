[0:00] My heart was distressed. These Jehovah's
[0:04] dread brown and low in the pit where my
[0:09] sins dragged me down. My cry to the Lord
[0:14] from the deep. My reclaim he tenderly
[0:18] brought me out to golden day.
[0:23] He brought me out of the merry clay.
[0:29] He placed my feet on a rock to stay.
[0:34] He put a song in my soul today.
[0:39] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[0:43] [Music]
[0:45] He placed me upon the strong rock by his
[0:49] side.
[0:50] My steps were established.
[0:53] Here I'll abide. No danger of falling
[0:58] while here I remain.
[1:02] And by his grace into his ground I gave.
[1:07] He brought me out of the mighty clay.
[1:12] He set my feet on a rock to stay.
[1:18] He put a song in my soul today.
[1:23] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[1:27] [Music]
[1:28] He gave me a song was a new song of
[1:32] praise. By day and by night, it sweet
[1:37] notes. I will raise my heart
[1:40] overflowing.
[1:42] I'm happy and free. I'll praise my
[1:46] redeemer has ransomed me.
[1:51] He brought me out of the mighty plane
[1:55] and he set my feet on a rock to stay.
[2:01] He put a song in my soul today. A song
[2:07] of praise. Hallelujah.
[2:12] King of his wonderful mercy to me. I'll
[2:17] praise him till all men and his goodness
[2:20] shall see. I'll sing our salvation at
[2:25] home and abroad till many shall hear the
[2:29] truth and trust in God. He brought me
[2:34] out of the mighty place.
[2:38] He sent my feet on a rock to stay.
[2:44] He put a song in my soul today.
[2:49] A song of praise. Hallelujah.

[2:57] this evening. Amen. Good to be gathered

[10:01] My head bow down in reence to your name.
[10:09] Oh Lord, I lift your name.
[10:15] Your holy

[10:20] Jehovah
[10:22] God

[10:28] You're the great I am
[10:33] the
[10:36] lamb.
[10:37] my comfort
[10:41] and king.
[10:46] And Lord, my heart's desire.
[10:51] It's to burn with spirit's power.
[10:56] My purpose is to worship you alone
[11:03] [Music]
[11:04] and open up my soul
[11:09] to worship and adore.
[11:13] Oh to be a fragrance offered to your
[11:18] throne.
[11:20] [Applause]
[11:21] And Lord, I lift your name,

[11:31] Jehovah
[11:34] God.
[11:40] You're the great I am
[11:45] the reason
[11:47] lamb
[11:49] my comfort
[11:53] and king.
[11:58] Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[12:00] bow our heads together.
[12:03] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father,
[12:05] for the privilege to stand here once
[12:08] again together. Lord, we appreciate you
[12:11] gathering us together once again. And we
[12:13] ask that you would bless us now as we
[12:16] look into your word, Lord. We ask that
[12:17] you would open our eyes, that you would
[12:19] open our hearts, that you'd help us to
[12:21] receive all that you have for us in this
[12:23] hour that we're upon the earth. May we
[12:26] be vessels that you can work through,
[12:27] Lord. May we be yielded and surrendered
[12:29] completely to you. May you take
[12:31] preeminence among all of us, Lord, and
[12:34] take us under your control and manifest
[12:36] yourself through each one of us. We're
[12:39] here to surrender ourselves again, to
[12:40] open our ears, to turn our hearts
[12:42] towards you. And may you come, Lord, and
[12:44] use this vessel of mine. May you come
[12:47] and Lord, and come yourself and and
[12:49] break the bread of life, Lord, and teach
[12:51] us and instruct us and equip us, Lord.
[12:54] We love you. We ask that you would do
[12:56] these things according to your word. In
[12:58] the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[13:03] Amen. God bless you. It's good to be
[13:05] together again this evening. We still
[13:06] have some visitors and want to say God
[13:08] bless you. We're welcome to we're
[13:10] welcome here. And while we're standing,
[13:12] if we could turn to the book of Matthew.
[13:15] I want to go to Matthew 11 for opening
[13:17] reading. Uh but just before we read
[13:19] that, I've got a card I want to share
[13:21] with you. Also, I want to let you know
[13:23] that brother uh null Johnson, I want to
[13:25] remind you, Brother Null Johnson will be
[13:26] here. He and Sister Shirley will come in
[13:28] this weekend. He'll be ministering for
[13:29] us in the morning service. And then we
[13:32] will have uh our regular communion
[13:35] communion and feet washing in the
[13:36] afternoon, Lord willing. And we'll also
[13:38] have a vote for a new trustee. Brother
[13:40] Aaron Laauo has been nominated by the
[13:42] trustee board. And so we'd like to hear
[13:44] from the congregation on Sunday evening.
[13:48] Also, we got a nice card in the mail for
[13:50] the congregation uh from Sister Karen
[13:52] Sanders. You know, Sister Karen, it kind
[13:54] of she took it upon herself. it fell on
[13:56] her shoulders to put together the
[13:58] memorial service for Sister Doris Boach.
[14:00] As soon as Sister Doris passed away, the
[14:02] whole family got sick. So, Sister Karen
[14:04] stepped in. And so, she wanted to send a
[14:07] thank you card for everyone who helped.
[14:09] She said, the card says, "You were right
[14:11] there when it mattered most with your
[14:13] help and support. You reached out and
[14:15] gave of your generous heart, and you
[14:18] made more of a difference than you
[14:19] probably even realized. Thank you for
[14:21] all your help." She sent a special thank
[14:23] you to several who really helped with
[14:25] particular things. She wanted to thank
[14:27] Sister Elizabeth Brooks and her family,
[14:28] Sister Suzanne Brooks, Sister Rachel
[14:31] Pittsenburgger, Brother Gabe and Sister
[14:33] Susan Smith, Sister Amber Hatfield, my
[14:36] wife, Sister Kate Preston, and Brother
[14:38] Franco and Sister Amy Gill. She really
[14:41] appreciated the specific help you gave.
[14:43] And then she wrote on the back a message
[14:45] to the whole congregation. I'd like to
[14:47] share it with you. says BCF, I have not
[14:50] the correct words to express to you for
[14:52] how you so willingly allowed the Lord
[14:54] Jesus to use his gifts in you to bless
[14:57] us. The expression out of this world fit
[15:00] you all perfectly. This world knows
[15:02] nothing about this kind of kindness. And
[15:04] perhaps because I have limitations, the
[15:06] Lord Jesus wanted me to witness his
[15:08] greatness in such a meaningful, humble,
[15:10] and helpful way. Yes, I know it was God
[15:12] and God uses people. So, I bid you all a
[15:15] humble thank you with all of my heart. I
[15:17] don't care how much you know until I
[15:19] know how much you care and I have seen
[15:21] how much you care because you reached
[15:23] out your hands and touched my heart.
[15:25] Signed, lovingly, Sister Karen. Amen.
[15:28] So, we appreciate that card and
[15:30] appreciate everyone who is able to pitch
[15:32] in and help and it made a difference for
[15:34] the family and for Sister Karen. Amen.
[15:37] So, thank you once again. If we look
[15:39] here at Matthew chap 11, I'd like to go
[15:41] ahead and uh turn to the Bible here.
[15:44] Matthew 11 and verse
[15:48] 28. Matthew 11 28
[15:53] says, "Come unto me all ye that labor
[15:55] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[15:58] rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of
[16:01] me, for I meek and lowly in heart, and
[16:03] you shall find rest unto your souls. For
[16:06] my yoke is easy, and my burden is
[16:08] light." Amen. God bless you as you have
[16:10] your seats.
[16:14] Amen. When we read this scripture, it is
[16:16] it is so refreshing. There's something
[16:19] about it that's so nice to hear that his
[16:23] yoke is easy and his burden is light.
[16:25] And I like to just read it together
[16:27] again because uh uh it sounds so good.
[16:31] Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[16:33] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[16:35] And so we we want to find what kind of
[16:37] rest is he talking about? Because the
[16:39] scripture itself will tell us, "Take my
[16:41] yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am
[16:43] meek and lowly in heart, and you shall
[16:45] find rest unto your souls." So that's
[16:48] the rest. He's not talking about a
[16:50] physical rest. He's talking about the
[16:51] rest in your souls. Amen. For my yoke is
[16:55] easy and my burden is light. because he
[16:58] is freeing us from the yoke and the
[17:00] burden of having to do something special
[17:04] to be admitted into the kingdom of God
[17:05] of having to do our own works or make it
[17:08] by our own abilities. And we were we
[17:10] were hitched to a wagon we couldn't pull
[17:13] and that was the law that was trying to
[17:15] live a perfect life to attain unto God.
[17:17] And he came to free us from that. And he
[17:20] says now yoke yourself to me. My yoke is
[17:23] easy and my burden is light because he
[17:25] has paid the price. He's paid the
[17:27] ultimate price for us, the price of
[17:29] redemption. Amen. And we've been
[17:30] purchased back to God. But so so now I I
[17:34] I just want to labor on this a little
[17:37] bit because it's triggered so much in my
[17:38] mind. He he's talking about the rest
[17:41] that comes to our souls as we connect
[17:44] with Christ, as we come to the
[17:45] revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's
[17:47] done for us and who we are in Christ and
[17:50] what he's purchased back and how he's
[17:52] redeemed us back to the father and he's
[17:54] done it all. And that brings rest unto
[17:57] our souls
[17:59] but not necessarily to our bodies.
[18:02] So when we when we look at this when we
[18:05] look at this scripture it sounds so
[18:06] nice. Amen. And if we tried to relate
[18:09] that to our life as a Christian in the
[18:11] natural realm all of a sudden it's not
[18:13] always easy and it's not always light.
[18:16] Is that right? Uh our natural life is
[18:19] not always easy. And so sometimes we
[18:20] read the scripture. Oh it sounds so
[18:22] nice. It' be so nice my it almost like
[18:25] life is easy and life is rest but that's
[18:29] not how our Christian life is. That rest
[18:31] is what's come to our souls.
[18:34] I'm going to read again a partial uh
[18:37] part of a quote that I I spent some time
[18:39] on on Sunday. So this is like a
[18:41] continuation of Sunday. Brother Frank,
[18:42] you can pull up the first slide if you
[18:44] can. Uh overcoming in the mind is the
[18:47] subject for tonight. But I I it's kind
[18:50] of a continuation of the thoughts from
[18:52] Sunday. And this quote that I read was
[18:54] out of the Simran church age and the
[18:55] church age book said, "The proof of his
[18:58] love is election." That no matter what
[18:59] happened, his love was proven truly by
[19:02] the fact that we were chosen unto
[19:04] salvation because God has chosen you
[19:06] into salvation through sanctification of
[19:07] the spirit and belief of the truth.
[19:10] That's the rest in your soul. that the
[19:13] revelation of election has struck you
[19:15] and that you were chosen in Christ
[19:16] before the foundation of the world and
[19:18] your name was on the lamb's book of life
[19:20] and Christ was the lamb slain from
[19:21] before the foundation of the world and
[19:23] everything is covered and everything is
[19:25] paid for that's the rest for our souls
[19:27] now that's what he establishes here in
[19:29] this section of the church age book the
[19:31] next sentence he may commit you to death
[19:34] as he did Paul he may commit you to
[19:37] suffering as he did Job that's his
[19:39] prerogative
[19:41] that doesn't sound like my yoke is easy
[19:43] and my burden is light. Amen. So I I
[19:47] hope that we're understanding things
[19:48] together. We don't want to get the wrong
[19:49] idea about what Jesus is saying. Amen.
[19:52] It doesn't mean that we're free from
[19:54] trial. We're free from pressure. We're
[19:55] free from difficulty. Brother Brandham
[19:57] says you're not. When we become a
[20:00] Christian, we get the wrong idea. We
[20:01] think we're free from troubles. Brother
[20:02] Brandham said that's when troubles
[20:04] start.
[20:06] And he may commit you to death as he did
[20:08] Paul. He commits you to suffering as he
[20:10] did Job. That is his prerogative. He is
[20:12] sovereign. But it is all with a purpose.
[20:15] If he did not have a purpose, then he
[20:16] would be the author of frustration and
[20:18] not of peace. His purpose is that after
[20:20] we have suffered a while, we would be
[20:22] made perfect, be established,
[20:24] strengthened, and settled. And so the
[20:27] yoke that that we're yolked to Christ is
[20:30] no longer the burden of having to do it
[20:32] on our own. The no longer the burden of
[20:34] having to prove anything, but God has
[20:36] already proved to us that we're accepted
[20:38] in the beloved. We were accepted in
[20:40] Christ Jesus and we can never be
[20:42] unaccepted. Amen. He has taken the
[20:44] burden upon himself. But now he's asked
[20:46] us to live his life and we surrendered
[20:48] our life to him. He's purchased us with
[20:50] his own blood. And it doesn't mean life
[20:52] is going to be a flowery bed of ease.
[20:54] Amen. Because he's given us rest for our
[20:56] souls. It's not rest yet for our bodies.
[20:59] We're still laboring. We're still
[21:00] striving. We're still wrestling against
[21:02] flesh.
[21:04] Amen. So we don't want to get the wrong
[21:06] idea. Amen. So then if that's where the
[21:09] rest comes, then that's where that's
[21:11] where our rest is found. Amen. Not in
[21:13] earth and not in the natural and not in
[21:15] all of that. Our rest is found in the
[21:18] rest that he's given to our souls.
[21:20] That's where our peace lies. You can be
[21:22] in the middle of turmoil and have peace
[21:24] in your heart. You can be in the middle
[21:26] of chaos in your life and have peace in
[21:28] your heart because he's given us rest
[21:31] for our souls.
[21:33] Man, I just want to uh uh highlight
[21:35] something from Sunday is when we took
[21:38] the scripture in Acts 16. Uh if you want
[21:41] to turn there with me, you can. Acts
[21:42] chapter 16 verse 23.
[21:55] Acts
[21:58] 16 verse 23.
[22:01] And when they had laid many stripes upon
[22:03] them, they cast them into the prison,
[22:04] charging the jailer to keep them safely,
[22:07] who having received such a charge,
[22:08] thrust them into the inner prison, and
[22:10] made their feast fast and stalks. My
[22:13] yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[22:19] See, all the scripture has to be true.
[22:21] My yoke is easy, my burden is light.
[22:23] Listen to the next sentence. And at
[22:24] midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang
[22:26] praises unto God, and the prisoners
[22:28] heard them. They had a different peace
[22:31] than the peace in the circumstances.
[22:33] They were in the middle of trouble and
[22:35] tribulation and difficulty. They were
[22:37] physically hurting. They were
[22:39] spiritually and emotionally wounded.
[22:41] They were they were in all kinds of
[22:43] trouble. But yet that rest in their
[22:45] soul, that peace on the inside never
[22:48] vanished away. There no circumstance
[22:50] could change what was inside of them.
[22:53] Amen. And they weren't basing, amen, the
[22:55] reaction to an action based off the
[22:58] circumstances, but based off the
[23:00] revelation of who they are, who God is,
[23:03] what God's called them for. And there's
[23:04] nothing that happens in the ch life of a
[23:06] child of God without God's purpose being
[23:09] behind it. So they could be in one of
[23:11] the worst of the worst situations, but
[23:13] at midnight, they lifted up their voice
[23:15] and sang praises to God. They weren't
[23:18] singing, "Oh, mournfold ballads. Oh God,
[23:20] we're so low down." Right. Right. Yes,
[23:23] they were singing praises. God, you're
[23:25] good. Amen. You're amazing. Your mercies
[23:27] are new every morning. Amen. In the
[23:30] midst of trouble, how could they do
[23:31] that? Because God had given them rest
[23:33] for their souls. They had a peace on the
[23:35] inside. They had a revelation of the
[23:37] elected love of God. And no circumstance
[23:40] was going to change that.
[23:43] Christ still died for them. They were
[23:45] still free. Their name was still in the
[23:46] lamb's book of life. They were still
[23:48] serving God's purpose. They were still
[23:50] the children of God no matter where they
[23:52] were. And they could sing.
[23:55] Praise be to God.
[23:58] Amen.
[24:00] Oh, I get excited. I don't know
[24:01] sometimes where to go or what to do or
[24:03] what to say next, but I just get
[24:05] excited. There's so much I want to say
[24:06] and you don't know that. You don't know
[24:08] how how full my bucket is, but I'm up
[24:11] here slloshing it around. Don't even
[24:12] know how to pour it out. that God is
[24:15] good. Because I love how the word of God
[24:17] will come and correct our thinking.
[24:19] Amen. Because we think my yoke is easy,
[24:21] my burden is light. And then why am I
[24:23] always in trouble and why am I cycle
[24:25] trouble and why are all these negative
[24:26] things happening to me? Amen. I'm a
[24:28] Christian. I gave my life to the Lord.
[24:30] And the prophet had come and taught us
[24:31] this so clearly. Amen. We can see in the
[24:34] scripture, you know, you could look at
[24:35] Paul. Paul could look over at Silas.
[24:37] Silas could look at Paul and he says,
[24:39] you know, his yoke is easy and his
[24:41] burden is light.
[24:43] feet fastened and stocked, back bleeding
[24:46] and bruised. Amen. Stripped down. Amen.
[24:48] But this still remains the truth. Amen.
[24:51] They were free people in the middle of
[24:53] bondage.
[24:55] They thought they could imprison them.
[24:57] They thought they could defeat them.
[24:58] They thought they could discourage them.
[25:00] They thought they could persuade them to
[25:02] stop following the Lord, stop preaching
[25:04] the gospel, stop being effective. Amen.
[25:06] So what they did is they tried, Amen, by
[25:08] by scorging, chastening, humiliating,
[25:11] imprisoning everything they could do to
[25:13] them. But they couldn't touch what was
[25:14] in their soul because what was in their
[25:16] soul was free from outside
[25:18] circumstances.
[25:20] And the outside circumstances couldn't
[25:22] change the revelation that was in their
[25:24] heart. And it was the revelation that
[25:26] gave them the voice to sing the song,
[25:28] not the circumstances.
[25:31] If we can only sing praise songs when
[25:33] things are going good and we can't sing
[25:35] praise songs when things are going bad,
[25:36] we need a deeper revelation.
[25:39] We need a deeper revelation of who we
[25:41] are in Christ and what Christ has done
[25:43] for us and what the plan of God is and
[25:45] his purpose in us. If we can't on our
[25:47] worst day, amen, when we settle it with
[25:50] in our hearts and we get over the tears
[25:51] and we get over the shock and say, "But
[25:53] the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away,
[25:55] blessed be the name of the Lord."
[25:58] That's the revelation that we need.
[25:59] That's victory, friends.
[26:03] Amen.
[26:05] Amen. I want to look here at this
[26:07] scripture
[26:10] in John chapter 19. This is Jesus on
[26:14] trial. When Pilate therefore heard this
[26:17] that saying, he was more afraid, and
[26:19] went again into the judgment hall, and
[26:20] saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But
[26:23] Jesus gave him no answer. Then saith
[26:26] Pilate unto him, Speakst thou not unto
[26:28] me? Knowest thou not that I have power
[26:30] to crucify thee, and I have power to
[26:32] release thee? Jesus answered, thou
[26:34] couldest have no power at all against
[26:36] me, except it were given thee from
[26:37] above. Therefore, he that deliverth me
[26:40] unto thee hath the greater sin. Jesus
[26:43] had a revelation
[26:46] and he had wrestled it out in
[26:47] Gethsemane. And in Gethsemane, he was
[26:49] wrestling with his own humanity, his own
[26:51] flesh. And he settled the question,
[26:54] Lord, if this cup can pass me, then so
[26:56] be it. not my will but thine will. And
[26:58] so by the time he got into the the the
[27:00] end of that, he knew what God's will
[27:03] was. And he knew that he was surrendered
[27:04] to God's will. And so he moved forward
[27:07] into the worst circumstance of his life
[27:09] with peace in his heart because he knew
[27:11] the will of God. And he knew who he was.
[27:14] Jesus never doubted who he was. He
[27:17] wasn't doubting whether or not he was a
[27:18] son of God. He wasn't doubting whether
[27:19] or not God loved him. Amen. He had
[27:21] wrestled his flesh into subjection
[27:24] because he had this desire to remain
[27:26] with his disciples, but this need to
[27:28] move on. And he wrestled it out till he
[27:30] could surrender. And he did that in
[27:31] Gethsemane. And now in the trial with
[27:34] the scorgings, with the beatings, with
[27:35] the crown of thorns, none of that moved
[27:37] him because in his heart, he knew who he
[27:40] was. And he knew this was the will of
[27:41] God.
[27:43] And all I'd say all around Jesus were
[27:46] people who were bound.
[27:49] And he was the only one who was free.
[27:52] The Jews were bound. Amen. by their own
[27:56] envy and their own fear. Amen. That that
[27:58] somehow they were going to lose a hold
[28:00] on the people and they were going to
[28:01] lose their position because of what he
[28:02] was teaching and the miracles that he
[28:04] was showing. They had to get rid of him
[28:05] because their their position was
[28:07] threatened. Amen. Pilate was bound,
[28:10] amen, by by this political situation
[28:12] between Rome and the Jews and and and
[28:15] his his own status, amen, as governor
[28:17] there. It was all precarious. He was
[28:20] bound by the circumstances. Pilate
[28:22] wanted to let Jesus go, but he couldn't
[28:24] let him go because he was bound by the
[28:27] circumstances and he was afraid. The
[28:29] Jews had him uh abound and crucified
[28:32] because they were afraid. The people
[28:34] were confused. They were bound by the
[28:35] religious leaders. Everybody in that
[28:37] circle was bound, tormented with fear,
[28:40] with no peace and no freedom. There was
[28:42] only one person in that whole scene,
[28:44] amen, that was at peace. Amen. Peace in
[28:47] his heart and free from any external
[28:49] bondage and free from fear. And it was
[28:51] the one who was in bondage with the
[28:54] crown of thorns on his head, bleeding
[28:55] from pores all over his body. He was the
[28:58] only free person in that whole midst.
[29:01] And he was free because of a revelation
[29:03] of who he was and that this was the will
[29:05] of God. and nothing shall defeat me.
[29:08] Jesus looks at his disciples. He says,
[29:10] "Nothing
[29:12] by any means shall harm you."
[29:15] Hallelujah.
[29:16] And they died by crucifixion. They died
[29:19] by beheading. They died by stoning.
[29:24] We got to look at the scripture
[29:26] spiritually, not physically. Because we
[29:29] we're so much more than a physical
[29:31] being. The physical being is the
[29:33] tabernacle that we dwell in. It's it's
[29:35] it it is the mechanism by which God
[29:37] engages with this dimension. But we're
[29:39] so much more than this physical realm.
[29:41] We're so much more than see, taste,
[29:43] feel, smell, and hear.
[29:46] And this is not real.
[29:50] This is the vapor. This is the mist.
[29:52] This is the negative. That's the
[29:54] positive. So there's got to be a
[29:56] revelation that will lift us out of this
[29:59] and show us a true reality that we can
[30:02] live by the true reality so that the
[30:04] negative so that the vapor so that the
[30:06] mist so so that the shadow doesn't
[30:08] control us but the truth controls us.
[30:13] So Jesus was conquering
[30:17] because he wasn't afraid. He wasn't
[30:20] bound.
[30:22] Paul and Silas
[30:24] were bound physically but free
[30:26] spiritually.
[30:30] Jesus was bound physically but free
[30:32] spiritually
[30:34] when everyone else was bound. So it's
[30:37] possible to be free even when you're
[30:40] bound.
[30:42] Even when you're bound by circumstances
[30:44] and bound by situations, you can still
[30:46] be free. You can still have peace. His
[30:50] yoke can still be easy and his burden
[30:53] can still be light.
[30:56] Amen. Remember on Sunday I talked to you
[30:58] about three parables that brother Benham
[31:00] taught used to explain the message. I
[31:02] want to go back to those three parables.
[31:04] The first one I want to talk about is
[31:06] the eagle in the chicken yard. So we all
[31:08] know the story of the eagle in the
[31:09] chicken yard. How the farmer the set a
[31:12] batch he he the set a a setting of of
[31:15] eggs. He went and took one out of the
[31:16] eagle's nest. It hatched out. It was odd
[31:18] to all the other birds and had a a a
[31:21] difficult life trying to be a chicken.
[31:23] But when Mama Eagle went looking for her
[31:25] baby and come over the chicken yard and
[31:27] screamed, it resonated inside and he
[31:29] realized he was a chicken.
[31:32] What's amazing is
[31:35] that eagle was in that chicken yard
[31:38] so long
[31:41] bound in the chickenard. Yes. Because
[31:44] there was a fence
[31:46] maybe 4 foot, 5 foot high, who knows how
[31:49] long. There was a fence all the way
[31:51] around the chicken yard. And that eagle
[31:53] could only go so far.
[31:55] He go here and he go there. That was a
[31:57] limit to where he could go. And he would
[31:58] go over here. He walk around. He was
[32:01] completely bound. But when the eagle
[32:03] screamed, s looked up for the first time
[32:06] and he looked into the clear blue sky
[32:07] and he saw a creature that reflected
[32:10] what was on the inside of him flying
[32:11] high and free. And that scream resonated
[32:14] in him. And then that eagle spoke back
[32:16] to him. You're my son. You're an eagle.
[32:19] You can fly.
[32:21] He said, "Mama, how do I get up there?"
[32:23] He said, "Just flap your wings. You've
[32:25] already got what it takes cuz you're
[32:26] already an eagle." And he flapped and
[32:28] began to rise on the post highest ever
[32:30] been. He tried again and went flying.
[32:32] That eagle was only bound because of its
[32:35] mind. It was not bound, Amen. It was
[32:38] only bound in the mind because of lack
[32:41] of proper teaching and understanding.
[32:43] Because it didn't have a revelation of
[32:45] who it really was. But as soon as it got
[32:47] the revelation of what it actually was,
[32:50] what its origin is, what its destiny
[32:52] was, immediately the bondage that held
[32:55] it, can't hold it anymore.
[32:57] And brother tells the story of of us as
[33:00] the eagles born in the chicken yard
[33:02] trying to make it in life and serve God
[33:04] in any way we could. Amen. But we were
[33:06] limited. So limited. and so bound. But
[33:08] we didn't realize we actually never were
[33:11] limited a day physically. There was no
[33:13] limitation. The limitation was in our
[33:15] minds.
[33:20] Amen.
[33:22] Amen. How many times the eagle wished it
[33:24] could go just a little further? And the
[33:27] whole time it could go a little further.
[33:29] It was born to fly. It was made to go.
[33:32] It was predestinated to see uh uh the
[33:35] the whole lay of the land. But it was
[33:37] only limited because of wrong
[33:39] understanding.
[33:41] Then I I went to the story of the slave
[33:45] and the the the slave trader going down
[33:48] and seeing this slave was outstanding
[33:50] slave, different than all the others,
[33:52] never had to be uh encouraged to work,
[33:54] never had to be beaten, but he did
[33:55] everything right. And he carried himself
[33:57] with a different air. And he asked the
[33:59] owner uh as uh can I buy him? And he
[34:01] said no. and and he began a discussion
[34:03] and he found out what made him so
[34:05] different and found out it was nothing
[34:07] in his physical circumstances that made
[34:09] him different. He said, "Do you feed him
[34:10] better than the others?" He said, "No."
[34:13] "Does he get better treatment?" No.
[34:16] There was nothing in his physical
[34:18] circumstances that gave him a different
[34:20] air, a different attitude, a different
[34:23] demeanor.
[34:24] When he come to it, he found out it's
[34:26] because this this man knew that at home
[34:31] his father is the king of the tribe and
[34:33] he's the son of a king and he's a
[34:36] prince. And though far from home and in
[34:38] terrible circumstances, he conducts
[34:41] himself as a prince, as the son of a
[34:43] king.
[34:45] So this is a man who's bound physically,
[34:48] but he's free in his mind. Completely
[34:51] free. He knows who he is. He knows where
[34:54] he came from and his circumstances don't
[34:57] dictate his actions.
[35:00] His actions are dictated by a clear
[35:03] understanding of who he is and where he
[35:05] came from and who he belongs to.
[35:09] Oh, you see how all these parables are
[35:11] so simple, but they're so deep, friends,
[35:13] and they have so much to do with you and
[35:15] I.
[35:17] Amen. Then the third one was the soldier
[35:20] with amnesia
[35:22] and he had forgot who he was and he
[35:23] forgot where he came from and he lost
[35:26] the ability to identify himself. And
[35:29] here is a man. He's not a prisoner, but
[35:32] he's bound.
[35:34] He doesn't have handcuffs on, but he's
[35:36] completely trapped in his circumstances.
[35:40] He's completely stuck in a situation he
[35:42] can't get free from. And he doesn't know
[35:44] his origin. He doesn't know who he
[35:46] belongs to. He doesn't know where he
[35:47] came from. He doesn't know where he's
[35:49] going. He doesn't know what his purpose
[35:50] is in his life. He's completely aimless
[35:52] and lost. And he's under the care of of
[35:55] the army because they don't know what to
[35:57] do with him because he's got this
[35:58] amnesia. They don't there's no home for
[36:00] him to go back to. They don't know where
[36:02] his home is. They don't know. They don't
[36:04] know what he did before, where he
[36:05] belongs, where he should go. And so, no
[36:07] doubt they're trying to sort this out in
[36:09] their minds. And here's a man that is
[36:10] completely bound. Although he's
[36:13] completely free,
[36:15] he's free from bound, but he's bound in
[36:18] his mind. He's bound because of his lack
[36:21] of understanding. He's bound because of
[36:23] no revelation. He's bound because he
[36:25] doesn't know who he is, where he came
[36:27] from, why he's there, and where he's
[36:29] going.
[36:31] But this message came to free us from
[36:33] that bondage. Friend, we know who we
[36:35] are. We know where we came from. We know
[36:37] where we're going. And we know why we're
[36:39] here. Amen.
[36:42] So how can we be bound?
[36:45] We can't be bound because his yoke is
[36:48] easy and his burden is light.
[36:52] Amen. Brother says in the message the
[36:55] greatest battle ever fought. He says so
[36:58] an army first in getting ready for a
[37:00] battle first thing's got to be a select
[37:02] some soldiers. They've got to be dressed
[37:04] for fighting. They've got to be trained
[37:06] for fighting. And I believe that the
[37:08] greatest battle that was ever fought is
[37:10] now ready to go in action. I believe
[37:13] that God has been selecting his
[37:15] soldiers. I believe he's been dressing
[37:17] them, training them, and the battlefront
[37:19] is now set, getting ready to start. So
[37:22] this message is preached in the
[37:24] beginning part of 1962 in the greatest
[37:27] battle ever fought. And brother Benham
[37:29] says, "I believe we're standing at the
[37:31] threshold of the greatest battle. I
[37:33] believe the soldiers are selected.
[37:35] They're being trained. They're being
[37:37] equipped. They're being fitted for the
[37:38] battle. But he says, "I believe we're
[37:40] getting ready to move into this great
[37:42] battle." But guess where this battle's
[37:45] going to take place? You all know it.
[37:47] You can beat me to the punchline. But
[37:49] Brother Benham's saying, "We're getting
[37:51] ready to move into this greatest
[37:53] battle." And this great and he says this
[37:54] right before the opening of the seals
[37:56] because there's going to be a mental
[37:57] battle break out because God is going to
[38:00] bring a revelation to a people on the
[38:02] earth of who they really is. Amen. and
[38:04] who they are in Christ and who Christ is
[38:06] in them. And they're going to find out
[38:08] that they're the dwelling place of
[38:10] Almighty God, the temple of God, the
[38:11] tabernacle of God. And they're going to
[38:13] find out that the fullness of Jesus
[38:15] Christ is being poured out upon the
[38:16] earth and being embodied in a people
[38:18] upon the earth. And you think that's not
[38:20] going to cause a mental battle. You
[38:22] think it's not going to cause a war in
[38:23] the mind. But God is equipping them,
[38:25] training them, bringing to them this
[38:27] great battle. And the great battle is
[38:29] over who you are.
[38:30] Yes, it takes place in the mind.
[38:34] And he says, "We're right at the
[38:36] battlefront now. It's getting ready to
[38:38] start." Praise God. I'm glad we've been
[38:42] equipped to fight this battle. Brother
[38:45] Beam says again, "And greatest battle
[38:47] ever fought, when this great battle
[38:49] started on earth, there had to be a
[38:51] mutual meeting place. There had to be a
[38:53] place selected for the battle to begin
[38:55] and for the battle to rage. And the
[38:57] battlegrounds begin in the human mind.
[39:00] There's where the battle starts. The
[39:02] human mind was chosen for the place of
[39:04] battle where it was began. And that is
[39:06] because that decisions are made from the
[39:08] mind, the head. Now, they never started
[39:12] from some organization. They never
[39:13] started it from some mechanical affair.
[39:15] The grounds never started there.
[39:17] Therefore, that organization can never
[39:19] never do the work of God because the
[39:21] battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[39:23] your enemy is in the mind. You've got to
[39:26] make your choice. It meets you.
[39:30] This is such good training.
[39:32] Such good teaching because where you're
[39:35] going to meet your enemy is in your
[39:37] mind.
[39:40] Because the external circumstances,
[39:42] whether they're good or whether they're
[39:43] bad, is not where we win and lose the
[39:46] fight. We win and lose it in the mind.
[39:50] That's where we meet our enemy.
[39:52] Amen. And and brother Brandham is so so
[39:57] clear at teaching us this. even teaches
[39:59] us that this battle that's raging didn't
[40:01] start on earth. The battle started in
[40:02] heaven when Lucifer rebelled against God
[40:05] and deceived the angels and they
[40:07] rebelled against God. And he says then
[40:10] the battle spilled from heaven on the
[40:12] earth and he said it began on earth and
[40:14] it began in us. So now where is this
[40:17] battle between these two great forces
[40:19] taking place? It's taking place in us.
[40:22] Where is the battle taking place? In our
[40:24] minds. Amen. So there's two opposing
[40:26] forces facing off. Brother Bam said to
[40:29] test their strength against one another.
[40:31] The power of God. Amen. And and the and
[40:34] the deception of the enemy of Satan. And
[40:36] these two forces are going to battle it
[40:38] out. And these two forces are going to
[40:40] see amen. Who has the greater strength.
[40:43] But they have to have brother Ram said,
[40:44] they don't just fight here and there and
[40:46] everywhere. They have to have a chosen
[40:47] place of battle. And the chosen place of
[40:49] battle is in the mind of man. And we can
[40:51] say in the mind of man, but I'll I'll
[40:53] bring it right down. The chosen place of
[40:55] battles is in your mind.
[40:57] What's facing off? The devil who
[40:59] deceived the angels in heaven and
[41:00] rebelled against God, who deceived Adam
[41:02] and Eve in the Garden of Eden and
[41:04] brought ruination to the creation of
[41:05] God. That force is battling the force of
[41:08] God in his word. And the battle's taking
[41:10] place in your mind. And he says, why? He
[41:12] said because decisions take place in the
[41:14] mind. And so what's determining which
[41:16] way this battle goes? It's it the the
[41:19] the determination on which way the
[41:21] battle goes is your free moral agency.
[41:25] What what thoughts you identify with,
[41:27] what thoughts you choose to be correct,
[41:30] what thoughts you you you accept as
[41:32] reality and that's determining how this
[41:34] battle is going.
[41:36] Praise God. We knows that Satan in the
[41:39] beginning took the mind of man to work
[41:40] through. God took his heart. God took
[41:42] the soul. But from the soul, God is
[41:44] working and fighting the devil in the
[41:46] mind. Amen.
[41:47] So that's the battlefield field. The
[41:49] devil can't get into your soul. Romans
[41:52] 12:1 says, "I beseech you therefore,
[41:54] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[41:56] you present your bodies a living
[41:58] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[42:01] which is your reasonable service, and be
[42:03] not conformed to this world, but you be
[42:05] transformed by the renewing of your
[42:07] mind, that you may prove what is the
[42:09] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[42:12] God." The only thing that could wash our
[42:14] minds and clean them is the word of God.
[42:16] Amen. By the power of his spirit can
[42:19] renew us and be can be transformed by
[42:21] the renewing of our mind.
[42:25] 1 Corinthians 2:16 says, "For who hath
[42:28] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[42:30] instruct him?" But we have the mind of
[42:33] Christ. We We certainly do. He's given
[42:36] it to us in full measure in this end
[42:37] time.
[42:39] If the mind of Christ is in us, then we
[42:42] will recognize the word to be the truth
[42:45] and it lives right through us. You can't
[42:48] help it. It's Christ.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:52] And look at this psalm
[42:54] says, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?
[42:58] And there is none upon the earth that I
[43:00] desire besides thee. My flesh and my
[43:03] heart faileth, but God is the strength
[43:06] of my heart and my portion forever.
[43:10] Listen, your flesh and your heart will
[43:12] failth. But who's the strength of your
[43:14] heart? It's God.
[43:17] It's this revelation of truth. It's this
[43:19] reality of almighty God. Because listen,
[43:22] you know, our heart, your heart and your
[43:24] mind, they go together. They're
[43:25] interchangeable in the Bible in in
[43:27] different places. But but your heart is
[43:30] just a seat of emotions and and seat of
[43:32] thinking and and so is your mind is the
[43:34] same way. And and in that area, listen,
[43:38] your your mind is is a hazardous place
[43:41] to spend time in.
[43:46] And your heart is treacherous.
[43:49] So treacherous. And so is your mind. Why
[43:52] is it your mind is so treach? Because
[43:53] your mind will change. Right. Yep. You
[43:56] just get c you just get settled on a
[43:58] certain thing. This is the way it's got
[44:00] to be. It's going to be this way. This
[44:01] is what I want. Amen. And you're
[44:03] standing in line at the restaurant.
[44:05] Yeah. I'm going to get this is what I
[44:06] want. And and then and then you get to
[44:08] the the checkout and the little girl
[44:10] behind the thing says, "Okay, what do
[44:11] you want?" And all of a sudden, mind
[44:12] goes blank. Something inside switch. I I
[44:14] don't know.
[44:16] I want something else. You can't depend
[44:20] on your mind. Amen. Amen. Your heart is
[44:22] treacherous. The heart of men is
[44:23] deceitfully wicked. Who can know it?
[44:25] Amen. There's got to be another force
[44:27] cuz my flesh and my heart failth. But
[44:29] God is the strength in my heart. Amen.
[44:31] Almighty God. He brings strength to my
[44:34] heart by how? By his spirit and his
[44:36] word. Amen. It's got to be something
[44:38] more than just my thinking. There's got
[44:40] to be something that comes from my soul.
[44:41] There's got to be a resonation with the
[44:43] word of God. And I've got to have the
[44:45] word of God in my mind. Amen. And it
[44:47] empowers me to do the right thing.
[44:50] Empowers me to take the right choice. So
[44:52] your heart, your heart is a traitor.
[45:00] Because you know how many times you
[45:01] thought just follow your heart. Just
[45:03] follow your heart. Well, it depends on
[45:04] what heart you're talking about. If
[45:06] you're talking about your soul and
[45:07] you've been born again, then that's
[45:08] right. But if you're talking about your
[45:10] seat of emotions and thinking,
[45:13] then you got to be careful. So just
[45:15] always follow your heart. But the
[45:16] problem is my heart bounces around like
[45:18] a rabbit. Amen. Sometimes it's happy.
[45:20] Sometimes it's sad. Sometimes I know
[45:22] what I'm doing. Sometimes I got no idea
[45:23] what I'm doing. And sometimes that takes
[45:25] place in a matter of five minutes time.
[45:29] My heart will determine that the very
[45:31] thing I have to do is go and talk to
[45:33] this person or say this or do that and
[45:35] then and then the minute you go to do
[45:37] it, Amen. All of a sudden your heart
[45:39] bails out on you.
[45:43] Amen. I remember I remember on a bus
[45:47] ride back from a youth trip coming back
[45:48] from Gatlinburg. We would rent a big bus
[45:51] and I I happened to be goofing off in
[45:53] the back, which I know it's hard for a
[45:54] lot of people to imagine, but I was
[45:57] Yeah, I was not the one you would want
[45:59] in your youth group or spending time
[46:00] with your kids.
[46:03] Sorry.
[46:04] Truth is the truth. I was goofing off in
[46:07] the back and finally I made a look to
[46:09] the front and I looked to the front and
[46:10] there was my future wife. Only I didn't
[46:12] know it at the time. She looked back at
[46:14] the same time our eyes met. You know how
[46:16] it is sometimes your eyes meet and all
[46:17] of a sudden it's more than just a look
[46:19] and it's like, "Wow,
[46:21] who's that?"
[46:23] And she always knew me as the bad boy.
[46:27] And she remembers me as the one who fell
[46:29] asleep in most Sunday school classes.
[46:32] And so she didn't have a great opinion
[46:33] of me, but all of a sudden something
[46:35] happened. And then, you know, my heart
[46:37] made up its mind. I got her phone number
[46:38] from a mutual friend. My heart made up
[46:40] its mind that I was going to call and
[46:41] ask her out. Do you know how many times
[46:44] my heart bailed out on me before I got
[46:46] those numbers pushed?
[46:48] Because your heart is treacherous. It'll
[46:50] go yes, then no, then yes, then no, then
[46:53] yes, then no. But God is the strength of
[46:55] my heart. I need something more than the
[46:57] human capacity. I need God in my life. I
[47:01] need to keep God in my mind. I need to
[47:02] keep God in my heart. I need to keep my
[47:04] mind and my heart and my soul focused on
[47:07] him. That's why we can't let our minds
[47:10] meander. We can't let our hearts Amen.
[47:12] go take a vacation from God and go down
[47:14] another path. We need God. He's the
[47:16] strength of our hearts. He's the
[47:17] strength of our life. We need to keep
[47:20] our heart and mind and soul, everything
[47:22] lined up to the word of God because your
[47:24] heart is so treacherous and your mind is
[47:26] so deceptive.
[47:30] Amen.
[47:31] We need him to be the strength of our
[47:33] heart.
[47:37] 1 Peter 1:13 says this, "Wherefore g up
[47:41] the loins of your mind." That means gird
[47:43] up the loins of your mind. When they
[47:45] would g up their loins, it was men when
[47:46] they would go to work. They had that
[47:47] long flowing robe in the in the Middle
[47:50] East there. They would gird it up,
[47:51] gather it up, bunch it up, and tie it up
[47:53] so they could really move. They could
[47:55] run. They could get to work. They could
[47:56] do whatever they want. And he's saying,
[47:57] "Gird up the loins of your mind. Listen,
[48:00] you got work to do. You've got to not be
[48:02] loose about this. Tighten it up and
[48:04] let's think. Gird up the loins of your
[48:06] mind. Be sober and hope to the end for
[48:11] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[48:12] at the revelation of Jesus Christ. This
[48:15] word sober I really like. I want to look
[48:18] at this word sober for a minute. G up
[48:20] the loins of your mind and be sober.
[48:23] This word sober when you get down to the
[48:25] definition it means to be sober to be
[48:27] calm and collected in spirit. to be
[48:30] temperate. That's mean to have
[48:32] self-control and dispassionate
[48:35] dispassionate
[48:37] and circumspect.
[48:39] So when you g up the lines of your mo
[48:42] mind, it says be dispassionate. I looked
[48:45] at this word and this word dispassionate
[48:46] means not controlled by extreme
[48:48] emotions.
[48:52] We got to gird up our mind and not let
[48:54] extreme emotions and high passions
[48:56] bounce us all over the place. But we
[48:58] have to be sober in our minds. We have
[49:02] to be sober thinking. We've got to slow
[49:04] down and not react so fast to everything
[49:06] that's going on around us. Amen. We got
[49:08] to be sober minded and be diligent,
[49:10] amen, with the choices we make. Cuz
[49:11] remember, your free moral agency, the
[49:14] choice you make is determining which way
[49:15] the battle's going. So, we got to be
[49:18] sober in our minds. Be calm, collected
[49:20] in spirit, be temperate, dispassionate,
[49:23] circumspect.
[49:24] Praise God. That is not the same as
[49:27] following your heart when your heart's
[49:29] going all over the place.
[49:31] But it's following that leadership of
[49:33] the Lord, following that still small
[49:35] voice, following the Lord in your life,
[49:37] following his spirit and following his
[49:39] word.
[49:42] Amen. Most of the time, if you got to do
[49:44] anything in a hurry, right now, real
[49:46] fast, or you're going to miss your
[49:47] chance, usually I just bail out because
[49:49] that's not how God leads me.
[49:52] Amen. Pressure, pressure, pressure. God
[49:55] doesn't do pressure, pressure, pressure.
[49:56] God leads as a shepherd. He goes before
[49:58] and he calls to his sheep. Because he
[50:00] goes before and calls to his sheep. That
[50:02] means wherever the dangerous spot is,
[50:03] he's already standing there because he
[50:05] goes before his sheep. So he's already
[50:08] from the danger zone calling to you,
[50:10] telling you it's safe. It's okay. You
[50:12] can come.
[50:13] Not behind you, pushing you, pushing
[50:15] you, pushing you. And you know how your
[50:17] heart and your mind gets pushed or gets
[50:19] drawn.
[50:22] Amen.
[50:23] In Deuteronomy 20, it says, "When thou
[50:28] goest out to battle against thine
[50:29] enemies, and seeest horses, and
[50:31] chariots, and people more than thou, be
[50:34] not afraid of them, for the Lord thy God
[50:36] is with thee, which brought thee up out
[50:38] of the land of Egypt. It shall be when
[50:40] you are come nigh into battle, that the
[50:42] priest shall approach and speak unto the
[50:43] people, and shall say unto them, Here, O
[50:46] Israel, ye approach this day unto battle
[50:48] against your enemies, let not your
[50:50] hearts faint. Fear not, and do not
[50:52] tremble, neither be ye terrified because
[50:55] of them. For the Lord your God is he
[50:57] that goeth with you to fight for you
[50:59] against your enemies to save you. He's
[51:02] saying, listen, you're going to go
[51:04] fight. You're going to go up against
[51:06] massive armies. And when you see their
[51:08] horses and you see their chariots, Amen.
[51:10] and you see the people, don't be afraid
[51:12] of them.
[51:14] He's not saying don't be afraid of them
[51:16] because you've got some human capacity.
[51:17] Don't be afraid. No, don't be afraid of
[51:19] them because God is with you. There's a
[51:22] revelation of who you are. That you are
[51:24] the chosen of God. You're the elect. You
[51:26] were chosen to take this land. You're
[51:28] the nation of Israel. You're the seed of
[51:29] Abraham. Don't forget who you are. And
[51:31] don't forget who's fighting for you. And
[51:34] I say that works every day of our lives.
[51:36] Friends, when we see insurmountable
[51:38] obstacles, things that we cannot
[51:39] overcome in our mind, cannot overcome in
[51:42] our flesh, don't be afraid
[51:45] because fear hath torment.
[51:48] But what cast out fear? Perfect love.
[51:52] So go back to the love that God has. And
[51:54] his love is known in election.
[51:57] And then it says then I love this.
[52:00] It says uh verse two, when you're come
[52:03] nigh in the battle, when you're coming
[52:04] to the battle, because God knows that
[52:06] we're human beings.
[52:08] when you're coming to the battle. Then
[52:10] the priest shall approach and speak unto
[52:13] the people and shall say unto them here,
[52:15] O Israel, ye approach this day in the
[52:17] battle against your enemies, let your
[52:18] heart, let not your hearts faint. Now
[52:21] the priest is reminding them of what
[52:22] Moses already told them what God already
[52:24] said. But the priest is coming along.
[52:26] That's why we're on a Wednesday night
[52:28] preaching things we've already preached
[52:29] before. Because when you're going into
[52:31] battle, the priest will come along and
[52:32] says, "Don't let your heart be afraid.
[52:35] [Music]
[52:36] You get a hold of that heart. You get a
[52:38] hold of your mind. Don't let it run
[52:40] rough shot off with you. Don't let your
[52:42] don't let your mind run away like a
[52:44] horse that that's broke its reigns. But
[52:46] you re that thing back in and be sober
[52:49] and say, "Listen, God's never fallen off
[52:51] the throne and bumped his head and
[52:53] forgot who I am or where I'm at. I still
[52:55] have a heavenly father. I'm still his
[52:57] child. My name is still in the Lamb's
[52:59] book of life. And it doesn't matter what
[53:00] the doctor just told me or what my boss
[53:02] just told me or what anybody else just
[53:04] told me. My life was hid in him before
[53:06] the foundation of the world and the
[53:08] works were finished before the
[53:09] foundation of the world. He knows what
[53:11] comes next.
[53:13] I have no idea. So the priest tonight,
[53:16] the the the pastor tonight, the preacher
[53:18] tonight is coming along to tell you as
[53:20] you go into battle,
[53:22] let not your hearts be faint.
[53:26] Let not your hearts faint. Listen, when
[53:28] he says, let not your hearts faint, he's
[53:30] not saying, you poor thing, I'm so sorry
[53:32] for you. I know this is really scary.
[53:34] He's saying get control of yourself.
[53:37] [Laughter]
[53:40] Don't Don't you dare let your heart run
[53:42] down that path. Don't let it run down
[53:44] that thought. Amen. You arrest that
[53:46] thing and you bring it back to the word
[53:48] of God.
[53:50] Let not your hearts faint. Fear not.
[53:54] Listen, that is such an interesting
[53:56] statement. How many of you have ever
[53:57] been afraid with an unreasonable fear?
[54:01] Fear not. It's like what? I can't help
[54:03] it. It's overwhelming me. It comes in
[54:07] waves sometimes and overwhelms you. And
[54:09] you would like just to flip a switch and
[54:10] not be afraid. Amen. But the fear not is
[54:13] not going to be a mechanical thing you
[54:14] can do as a human being. But the only
[54:16] way is you're going to have to put your
[54:17] trust back in something that's greater
[54:19] than the fear. Amen. Whatever the fear
[54:22] is, when you can look to God who's over
[54:24] everything that will make you afraid and
[54:25] then set your heart on him. Amen. And
[54:28] have peace in him. Amen. Fear not, and
[54:32] do not tremble,
[54:34] neither be ye terrified because of them.
[54:37] For the Lord your God is he that goeth
[54:39] with you to fight for you against your
[54:42] enemies to save you. That statement is
[54:45] just as true today as it was when Moses
[54:48] said it. It's just as real, just as
[54:51] permanent, and it's happening day by
[54:53] day. So, I'm here to tell you, don't let
[54:57] your heart faint.
[54:59] Don't be afraid.
[55:02] Do not tremble
[55:04] and neither be terrified because of
[55:06] what's happening in life. For God is
[55:10] with you.
[55:12] And I can say more than that. He's in
[55:14] you.
[55:18] See, this is why Paul and Silas could
[55:20] sing at midnight.
[55:23] This is why Jesus could stand in the
[55:25] face of death and not flinch. Pilate was
[55:28] trying to, you know, work something out,
[55:30] trying to find a way to let him go. And
[55:31] Jesus just kept silent. And he wasn't
[55:34] afraid and he wasn't being persuaded by
[55:36] the circumstance. He wasn't being
[55:37] pushed. He was just quiet. He already
[55:40] knew. He was resolved to go God's way.
[55:42] And and Pilate saying, "Don't you know I
[55:45] have this power?" And he comes back with
[55:47] the greatest truth Pilot's ever heard.
[55:49] You have no power unless it were given
[55:50] to you from above.
[55:52] Jesus knew exactly who he was, who his
[55:55] father was, and where he stood. and he
[55:56] had no reason to be afraid. Amen.
[56:01] It's like it's like the disciples, they
[56:03] were scared until they were born again.
[56:05] And now when they when they had this
[56:06] peace in their souls. Amen. Now when
[56:08] they were arrested and they were called
[56:10] before the Sanhedrin, they were they
[56:11] were they were they were uh rebuked,
[56:13] they tried to make them afraid. They
[56:15] drew them aside. They had a little
[56:16] huddle. What can we do? And then they
[56:18] tried to frighten them. And they threat
[56:21] it says threaten. The Bible use the word
[56:22] threaten. So they threaten them. What do
[56:24] you threaten somebody? A threat is to
[56:25] intimidate or scare somebody. So they
[56:28] threatened them that they no more preach
[56:29] in his name. And they were trying to
[56:31] intimidate. They were trying to make
[56:32] them afraid. Only the difference now
[56:34] between then and now is they the the the
[56:37] Lord God was their strength of their
[56:39] heart. Amen. They had a revelation. They
[56:42] had they they knew who they were. They
[56:44] had been born again. They had Christ
[56:45] dwelling on the inside. And now they
[56:47] came and say, "Hey, listen. You tell us.
[56:49] Is it better to obey man or to better to
[56:51] obey God?" Then they had another
[56:53] council. You know, they pushed him off
[56:54] to the side and that's when Galio said,
[56:56] "Hey, be careful how you deal with
[56:57] them." So, they come back and they let
[56:59] him go and they beat them.
[57:02] They beat them and turned them loose and
[57:03] said, "Preach more in this name." And
[57:05] they ran back to the house where there
[57:07] was a prayer meeting going on. And when
[57:08] they got back, they couldn't wait to
[57:10] tell them what happened. Guess what?
[57:13] They took us and they we we got to
[57:15] testify in front of the whole Sanhedrin
[57:19] and they rejoiced
[57:22] that they were able to suffer for his
[57:24] name's sake. They were free in their
[57:27] minds. They could not be bound by the
[57:29] threats and the intimidation of the
[57:31] Sanhedrin because they were already
[57:32] free.
[57:34] This word makes us free.
[57:38] Cannot be intimidated. You cannot be
[57:41] manipulated. Amen. Only if you allow it.
[57:44] Because there's no reason to be when you
[57:45] know who you are and you know who your
[57:47] father is and you know why you're on
[57:48] this earth and you're here to serve a
[57:50] purpose. Who's going to intimidate you?
[57:52] Who's going to manipulate you? Who's
[57:54] going to make you afraid when you have a
[57:55] heavenly father?
[57:59] In John 14,
[58:02] Jesus says, "These things have I spoken
[58:04] unto you, being yet present with you.
[58:06] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[58:09] Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
[58:11] name, he shall teach you all things, and
[58:13] bring all things to your remembrance,
[58:14] whatsoever I have said unto you.
[58:17] Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
[58:20] you. Not as the world giveth, give I
[58:23] unto you. Let not your heart be
[58:25] troubled, neither let it be afraid.
[58:30] Here's Jesus is saying what they heard
[58:32] in Deuteronomy.
[58:34] Let not your heart be troubled, neither
[58:37] let it be afraid. I love this
[58:40] terminology. Think about it.
[58:43] Let not your uh let not your heart be
[58:45] troubled, neither let it be afraid. That
[58:47] means you don't let it be afraid.
[58:51] You reign that heart back in. You bring
[58:53] that mind back subject to the word and
[58:56] line it back up with the word. And Jesus
[58:58] says, "Peace I leave with you. My peace
[59:01] I give unto you. I give you peace.
[59:04] He says, "Some of you they will kill and
[59:06] some of you there they will stone and
[59:08] they will chase you from village to
[59:09] village and they will persecute you and
[59:12] wrongly accuse you and mistreat you
[59:14] thinking they do God a service." So what
[59:17] kind of peace is he leaving them? Not
[59:19] that kind of peace. Amen. Not a peaceful
[59:21] life. Not an easy life. But he's giving
[59:24] them peace in their souls. Amen. Because
[59:27] of a revelation of who they are. And he
[59:29] says, "Let not." Don't you dare let that
[59:32] heart be troubled and don't let it be
[59:34] afraid. You can't stop it from being
[59:37] afraid, but don't let it stay in that
[59:38] condition, friends. Bring it back to the
[59:41] revelation of the word. Again, in the
[59:44] greatest battle ever fought, he says,
[59:46] now remember, it's not Christian
[59:48] science, mind over matter, that the mind
[59:52] accepts the life, which is the word of
[59:54] God, and there brings the life. Just
[59:57] your thought doesn't do it. This isn't
[1:00:00] just about positive thinking. This is
[1:00:02] about thinking on the word. It's the
[1:00:04] word that has the life. It's not just
[1:00:07] your thought that has your life. It's
[1:00:08] your thought lined up with the word.
[1:00:10] When you agree with the word, then the
[1:00:12] word has life and the word can manifest
[1:00:14] because you're in agreement with the
[1:00:15] word. All right? So, your thought
[1:00:19] doesn't do it, but the word of God
[1:00:21] brought in the channel of your thought.
[1:00:24] Catch that. I'm going to read I'm going
[1:00:25] to read slowly. I'm going to go back up
[1:00:27] to the second line. The mind accepts the
[1:00:29] life which is the word of God and there
[1:00:32] brings the life. Just your thought
[1:00:34] doesn't do it. But the word of God
[1:00:36] brought in the channel of your thought.
[1:00:39] See, it's not the thought as Christian
[1:00:41] Science might make it. Mind over matter.
[1:00:43] No, that isn't it. But your mind accepts
[1:00:46] it. It grasp it. What does your mind
[1:00:48] control by? Your spirit. And your spirit
[1:00:50] catches the word of God. And that's the
[1:00:52] thing that's got life in it. It brings
[1:00:54] life into you. Oh, brother. When that
[1:00:57] takes place, when life comes down that
[1:00:59] channel into you, the word of God is
[1:01:02] manifested in you. This is why you can't
[1:01:05] let your mind, you can't let your heart
[1:01:07] go those places. You've got to bring it
[1:01:09] back in line with the word because
[1:01:11] through the channel of the word, it
[1:01:13] comes in and drops into your heart and
[1:01:15] comes into manifestation.
[1:01:18] Amen. 2 Corinthians 10 says, "For though
[1:01:21] we walk in the flesh, we do not war
[1:01:24] after the flesh. For the weapons of our
[1:01:26] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:01:27] through God to the pulling down of
[1:01:29] strongholds, casting down imaginations,
[1:01:31] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:01:34] against the knowledge of God, and
[1:01:36] bringing into captivity, every thought
[1:01:38] to the obedience of Christ. And Christ
[1:01:40] is the anointed word. So bring every
[1:01:44] thought
[1:01:45] cap into captivity.
[1:01:48] I've said it before. I've taught this
[1:01:50] years ago, but you have to catch every
[1:01:52] thought that's running around your mind.
[1:01:55] and bring it into captivity. Capture it.
[1:01:58] I mean, it's rolling and rolling. Catch
[1:01:59] it one time and bring it into obedience
[1:02:02] of Christ and say, "This thought does
[1:02:04] not match this scripture. So, I reject
[1:02:06] this thought in the name of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ."
[1:02:10] That thought that I'm not good enough.
[1:02:11] I've already been accepted in the
[1:02:13] beloved. That the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:15] is more than enough to pay for me. I'm
[1:02:17] already been redeemed. I'm already
[1:02:18] accepted in the beloved. I'm already on
[1:02:20] the lamb's book of life. God knows the
[1:02:22] end from the beginning. So that thought
[1:02:24] is not according to his word and I
[1:02:26] reject that thought that I'm not good
[1:02:27] enough. And I cast it out of my mind in
[1:02:30] the name of Jesus Christ. And you try
[1:02:32] that once and tell me if you can't take
[1:02:35] dominion over a thought.
[1:02:37] So many times we just try not to think
[1:02:38] about it anymore.
[1:02:41] Try not I don't want to think about that
[1:02:42] anymore. I don't want to be I'm trying
[1:02:44] not to be. I'll change subjects and it's
[1:02:47] always there. But bring that thing
[1:02:50] captive.
[1:02:52] Catch it. Catch it and bring it to the
[1:02:55] judgment seat
[1:02:57] and judge it according to the word. And
[1:02:59] if it doesn't match the word, cast it
[1:03:01] out. Bind it. Reject it. Tell the devil
[1:03:03] you won't listen to it. Cuz where is the
[1:03:06] greatest battle taking place?
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:12] Hebrews 12. Wherefore, seeing we are
[1:03:15] also compassed about with so great a
[1:03:16] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[1:03:19] every weight and the sin which does so
[1:03:21] easily beset us, and let us run with
[1:03:23] patience the race that is set before us,
[1:03:25] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:03:27] finish of our faith, who for the joy
[1:03:29] that was set before him endured the
[1:03:31] cross, despising the shame, and is set
[1:03:33] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:03:35] God. For consider him that endured such
[1:03:38] contradictions of sinners against
[1:03:39] himself, lest you be wearied and faint
[1:03:42] in your minds. When we get a little bit
[1:03:45] tired of fighting our battles, we're
[1:03:47] supposed to look to Christ.
[1:03:50] We're supposed to be compass about by a
[1:03:52] great cloud of witnesses and go back and
[1:03:54] read Hebrews 11 and see what they all
[1:03:56] overcame. See what all of our brothers
[1:03:59] and sisters through time have had to go
[1:04:00] through and look unto Jesus, the author
[1:04:02] and finisher of our faith. For the joy
[1:04:05] that was set before him, he endured the
[1:04:06] cross, despising the shame. And when you
[1:04:11] when you consider that,
[1:04:14] Amen. Consider that so you don't become
[1:04:17] wearied and faint in your minds
[1:04:20] because that's the picture that was set
[1:04:22] before us. Christ, in order to endure
[1:04:26] all that he had to endure, he had to set
[1:04:28] his eyes a little higher than the earth,
[1:04:31] a little higher than the circumstances.
[1:04:32] He had get his focus on what the eternal
[1:04:35] purpose of God was and what the plan of
[1:04:37] God was. And he had to fix his eyes on
[1:04:39] there and he had to walk forward. And he
[1:04:41] went through so much because of because
[1:04:45] of what he knew, because of who he was,
[1:04:48] because of his revelation, because he
[1:04:50] was free.
[1:04:52] Not bound, but free.
[1:04:55] Proverbs 23:7, for as he thinkketh in
[1:04:57] his heart, so is he. This Proverbs
[1:05:01] talking about a man who invites you over
[1:05:02] and he has all kinds of delicious things
[1:05:05] for you to eat and he said, "You better
[1:05:06] be careful. He bids you to eat, but he's
[1:05:08] got deception in his heart." But but the
[1:05:10] point of the the the I just pulled out
[1:05:12] just a point of the scripture because
[1:05:14] for as he thinkketh in his heart, so is
[1:05:16] he. The man's being nice to he's being
[1:05:18] cordial. He's inviting you, but he's got
[1:05:19] other plans in his heart. For as as he
[1:05:23] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. So
[1:05:25] what is he? He's what he thinkketh in
[1:05:27] his heart. All right. So, what are we?
[1:05:31] What we think in our heart? That's why
[1:05:33] we've got to judge our thoughts. That's
[1:05:35] why we've got to reject the wrong
[1:05:37] thoughts and think the right thoughts.
[1:05:41] Because what you think about, what we
[1:05:44] meditate on. Listen, we want to we all
[1:05:47] want to meditate on the word. Is that
[1:05:48] right?
[1:05:50] Why is it when we get in trouble, the
[1:05:52] only thing we can meditate on is our
[1:05:53] trouble?
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:05:57] And when we meditate on our trouble, our
[1:05:59] trouble becomes everything in our life.
[1:06:02] It becomes whatever you focus on grows.
[1:06:05] Whatever you focus on grows in your mind
[1:06:07] and in your life. And if you get into
[1:06:09] trouble and the only thing you focus on
[1:06:11] is your trouble, your situation, the
[1:06:12] circumstances, and that's it. That thing
[1:06:14] will grow to a proportion. It will
[1:06:16] become overwhelming in your life and in
[1:06:18] your mind. But if you can put that thing
[1:06:20] back in perspective, amen, you can focus
[1:06:22] your mind on how great God is and what
[1:06:25] God has done and who you are in Christ
[1:06:27] and put this thing that tries to be a
[1:06:29] monumental disaster in front of you. Put
[1:06:31] it back in perspective when you line it
[1:06:33] up against God and you find this isn't
[1:06:37] the greatest disaster. This isn't the
[1:06:38] biggest thing and this isn't the most
[1:06:40] difficult thing to overcome.
[1:06:42] God has already defeated this thing.
[1:06:46] And so, Brother Bam says several things
[1:06:48] about thinking, and I want to I want to
[1:06:50] read through those.
[1:06:52] He said, 'Let positive in our thinking.
[1:06:55] Let's believe that this night, the
[1:06:57] revival will break out in Angela's
[1:06:58] temple tonight. Let's believe that this
[1:07:00] is the night that God will do the
[1:07:02] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:07:04] could do or think. He will do it
[1:07:06] tonight. Don't take no for an answer.
[1:07:08] It's when we think those things, you
[1:07:10] create an atmosphere around you. And
[1:07:13] that's not just for the positive. That's
[1:07:15] for the negative. Brother Bam said, "You
[1:07:17] ever been around somebody and they
[1:07:18] create that atmosphere, you just want to
[1:07:19] get away from them?" So then you ever
[1:07:22] get around that person and they got such
[1:07:24] a nice atmosphere around them? I think
[1:07:26] this Yeah. This next quote says this.
[1:07:28] Did you ever meet people that you just
[1:07:30] love to be with? You you've had that.
[1:07:33] And why? They create an that atmosphere
[1:07:35] by their life, the way they live, the
[1:07:38] things they think about, and the love
[1:07:41] that they have for you.
[1:07:43] So the things we think about create an
[1:07:45] atmosphere around us
[1:07:48] and and it doesn't take long to find out
[1:07:50] what somebody's thinking about and why
[1:07:51] there's a negative atmosphere because
[1:07:52] you keep talking long enough it'll
[1:07:53] eventually start spilling out of their
[1:07:54] mouth because it's the only thing on
[1:07:56] their minds.
[1:07:59] It won't doesn't take long till it's do
[1:08:00] you did you hear what happened to me?
[1:08:03] You hear what they said about me? Did
[1:08:04] you hear this? You hear that rumor? Did
[1:08:06] you hear this thing? Did you see this?
[1:08:07] Do you know what my trouble is? Did you
[1:08:09] hear what the doctor said? Amen. That's
[1:08:11] that's that's all that's on the mind.
[1:08:13] Amen. And the worry and the anxiety or
[1:08:15] the hurt or the offense or or the or or
[1:08:18] or whatever the rejection when they
[1:08:20] become to think about it all the time,
[1:08:22] you become what you think and you create
[1:08:24] the atmosphere of what you're thinking
[1:08:25] about all around you.
[1:08:28] Amen.
[1:08:30] So that's why brother said let's keep
[1:08:32] our thinking positive.
[1:08:35] And greater than Sodom, he says, don't
[1:08:36] have nothing else in your mind. Keep
[1:08:39] thinking that if there be any praise, if
[1:08:41] there be any virtue, think on these
[1:08:42] things. You cannot get anything from God
[1:08:45] with a negative thought.
[1:08:48] He that cometh to God must believe that
[1:08:49] he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:08:51] diligently seek him.
[1:08:54] Amen. Why? You got to bring the word
[1:08:56] through the channel of the thought. Your
[1:08:57] thought has to agree with the word.
[1:09:00] Philippians 4:6, "Be careful for
[1:09:02] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[1:09:04] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[1:09:06] requests be made known unto God. And the
[1:09:09] peace of God which passes all
[1:09:10] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:09:13] minds through Christ Jesus." Finally,
[1:09:16] brethren, who whatsoever things are
[1:09:18] true, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:09:22] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:09:24] things are good, of good report, if
[1:09:26] there be any virtue, if there be any
[1:09:28] praise, think on these things.
[1:09:32] So the thought that's troubling your
[1:09:33] mind, if it doesn't match this criteria,
[1:09:36] reject it.
[1:09:37] So, it's got to be honest,
[1:09:41] are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of
[1:09:46] good report, of virtue, and have praise.
[1:09:49] And if the thoughts that are troubling
[1:09:51] your mind don't match up, they don't
[1:09:53] meet that requirement, then say, "I
[1:09:55] reject that thought in Jesus' name, and
[1:09:58] I'm going to focus my attention."
[1:10:00] Sometimes the only thing you can do is
[1:10:01] turn on a sermon. The only thing you can
[1:10:03] do is call up somebody to encourage you.
[1:10:04] The only thing you can do is play
[1:10:06] worshipful music. You've got to change
[1:10:08] the environment around you. You got to
[1:10:10] change your mind from fixating on things
[1:10:13] that are negative and dragging you down
[1:10:14] and creating a bad atmosphere and not
[1:10:16] getting you where you want to be. We've
[1:10:18] got to take control of the mind.
[1:10:25] Amen. There's a story, not a story, it's
[1:10:29] it's a question and answers that I want
[1:10:32] to share with you. This is in 1964 in
[1:10:35] the August questions and answers. And
[1:10:37] the question comes like this from a
[1:10:39] sister. He says, "Brother Brandham, what
[1:10:41] shall we do? Something has settled over
[1:10:44] me that I cannot break through.
[1:10:47] Last fall, I dreamed I was lost in white
[1:10:49] sands. It was getting dark. I couldn't
[1:10:52] find my way. This dream has stayed with
[1:10:55] me since last fall. Now I'm as one
[1:10:58] groping in darkness. My son Irvin and
[1:11:01] wife were included in my dream. Now they
[1:11:03] are also in darkness. We are in
[1:11:06] desperation. I believe God will show you
[1:11:09] what is in our hearts. Now if we are
[1:11:12] wrong or sinning places tell us we want
[1:11:15] to be right. It's interesting question.
[1:11:18] This woman wants to know what shall we
[1:11:21] do? Now I want to go back to the first
[1:11:24] thing she said. Something has settled
[1:11:26] over me that I cannot break through. And
[1:11:29] it all started with this dream. In the
[1:11:31] dream, she was walking on white sands
[1:11:32] and somehow her her son and
[1:11:35] daughter-in-law were part of the dream
[1:11:36] and walking white sands and then it
[1:11:38] began to get dark or began to fade out,
[1:11:40] began to get dark and then she got
[1:11:42] troubled and she's now something has
[1:11:44] come over her. She cannot break through.
[1:11:47] Now they're also in darkness because
[1:11:49] they were included in the dream. They're
[1:11:51] in desperation and they believe God will
[1:11:53] show them what's in their hearts. And if
[1:11:55] they're wrong or sinning in places, they
[1:11:58] want to know. She says, "Tell us we want
[1:12:00] to be right." So that's the question.
[1:12:02] And she's in a bad spot. How many can
[1:12:04] hear the uh the question and believe
[1:12:06] that she's in a bad spot? I believe
[1:12:08] she's troubled in her mind,
[1:12:11] in her heart. Now, here's brother
[1:12:13] Brennham's answer. It's so good.
[1:12:16] I don't know the lady, but I just feel
[1:12:18] if you're here, lady, that here is your
[1:12:21] trouble.
[1:12:23] You have let something happen to you
[1:12:25] that's made you nervous because being in
[1:12:27] white sands represents purity and
[1:12:29] righteousness
[1:12:31] and you're just letting Satan put one
[1:12:34] over on you.
[1:12:36] Your dream proved that there's nothing
[1:12:38] wrong. You're only nervous. And by doing
[1:12:41] this and thinking this, you're making
[1:12:43] the rest of your family nervous.
[1:12:46] Stop doing it. Amen. Claim your
[1:12:49] God-given rights. Your dream proves by
[1:12:53] the interpretation that you are in white
[1:12:55] sands. Everything's all right. It's you
[1:12:58] yourself being nervous.
[1:13:03] I love this. And you let one member of
[1:13:06] the family get nervous. It goes to the
[1:13:08] next member and the next member. And the
[1:13:09] first thing you you're all fussing and
[1:13:11] going on and one member of the family
[1:13:13] gets kind of upset about something. It
[1:13:15] upsets the other and the other and the
[1:13:17] other and the first thing you know the
[1:13:19] whole family's upset.
[1:13:21] It's Satan. Then if one member of the
[1:13:24] family rejoices, let the rest of them
[1:13:25] rejoice with it. So every one of the
[1:13:27] family try to do that. Try each one of
[1:13:30] you children to help your papa, mama,
[1:13:31] mama, you papa, you try to help your
[1:13:33] children. Now listen what he says. Don't
[1:13:35] let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get
[1:13:38] around you.
[1:13:40] You are Christians. You are born of the
[1:13:42] spirit of God. You're salt of the earth.
[1:13:44] You have God-given rights. And the Bible
[1:13:46] said, "If any praise, if there be any
[1:13:48] virtue, think on these things." Don't
[1:13:51] think about the wrong thing.
[1:13:54] And sister, I think that's your trouble,
[1:13:57] sister dear.
[1:13:58] It seemed so spiritual. It seemed like
[1:14:00] it was from God. Amen. But look at the
[1:14:03] results it brought in her life. She
[1:14:05] didn't have any interpretation for it.
[1:14:07] She just began to to think that because
[1:14:09] it got dark that somehow there was some
[1:14:11] trouble. There was something and some
[1:14:13] gloom came over. She said something
[1:14:14] settled over me that I can't break
[1:14:16] through. And the whole time there wasn't
[1:14:18] a thing in the world wrong. There was no
[1:14:21] problem. Nothing wrong between her and
[1:14:23] God. She wasn't in hidden sin. She
[1:14:25] wasn't in error. There was nothing wrong
[1:14:26] with her son or daughter-in-law. She She
[1:14:28] got so gloomy she spread it to others
[1:14:32] because she kept thinking negative and
[1:14:34] negative. Something's wrong. Something's
[1:14:35] bad. Something's wrong. Something's bad.
[1:14:37] And nothing was wrong. And nothing was
[1:14:39] bad. There wasn't a single problem.
[1:14:41] Amen. The devil tricked her and because
[1:14:44] she identified with the evil report, she
[1:14:47] began to manifest everything she was
[1:14:49] thinking on and she got herself in a
[1:14:51] gloom and she got wor down and she got
[1:14:53] troubled and she spread it to her family
[1:14:55] and they were all, he says, she goes,
[1:14:57] "We are desperate."
[1:15:00] They all got into a desperate situation
[1:15:03] over
[1:15:04] nothing.
[1:15:08] Nothing.
[1:15:10] The greatest battle ever fought is
[1:15:12] fought here.
[1:15:15] If that can happen when there's nothing,
[1:15:19] what about when something bad actually
[1:15:20] happens?
[1:15:23] We can go down the same path and get
[1:15:24] ourselves in just as much trouble. Hey,
[1:15:26] listen. We've got to focus on the things
[1:15:28] that are true, the things that are
[1:15:30] honest, the things that are lovely, the
[1:15:32] things that are just, the things that be
[1:15:33] of good report. And if there's any
[1:15:35] praise, if it's worthy of any praise,
[1:15:37] think on these things. And don't think
[1:15:38] on the other things.
[1:15:41] Refuse to let it have access to your
[1:15:42] mind and refuse to let your mind wander
[1:15:45] all in dark, gloomy places. Bring it
[1:15:47] back to the truth, to the word of God
[1:15:49] and say the word is true and everything
[1:15:51] else is a lie.
[1:15:54] That absolutely blessed me so much when
[1:15:57] I read that that we can get ourselves in
[1:15:59] such a dark spot over nothing.
[1:16:02] So, I'm not going to let myself get in a
[1:16:04] dark spot, and by the help of God, I
[1:16:06] want to focus on that which is true and
[1:16:08] lovely and just and of good report and
[1:16:10] of praise because that's the truth. And
[1:16:14] if I've done something wrong, God will
[1:16:15] tell me. He's not going to let me wander
[1:16:17] all over the place not knowing. But I'm
[1:16:19] not going to start making up things and
[1:16:20] gloomy thoughts and gloom and doom over
[1:16:23] nothing.
[1:16:25] Over nothing.
[1:16:27] I'd rather go on blissfully ignorant.
[1:16:31] that I've ever done anything wrong and
[1:16:33] be happy and joyful and a son of God and
[1:16:35] happy with every day of my life because
[1:16:37] I have a heavenly father and he loves me
[1:16:39] and wait for the time that God says
[1:16:40] listen you've missed it but here it is
[1:16:42] and then I can deal with it. Then I know
[1:16:45] I can repent. I can deal with it. I can
[1:16:47] make it right. But until then I'm not
[1:16:49] going to start inventing, well maybe
[1:16:50] it's this and maybe it's that and maybe
[1:16:52] it's this and maybe it's that and maybe
[1:16:54] it's me and maybe it's not me. Maybe
[1:16:56] it's the people around me. Maybe it's my
[1:16:58] husband. Maybe it's my wife. Maybe it's
[1:16:59] my parents. Maybe I got an evil spirit
[1:17:01] on me from generation. Maybe it's the
[1:17:03] church I'm in. Maybe it
[1:17:08] that's Satan.
[1:17:10] That's how he works with negative
[1:17:11] thinking. We got to throw that away and
[1:17:13] say there's nothing wrong between me and
[1:17:15] God. And if there is, he'll show me.
[1:17:17] He's a good father. He's a heavenly
[1:17:19] father. He doesn't want me to live in
[1:17:21] gloom. He wants me to be free. In order
[1:17:23] to be free, he's got to tell me what's
[1:17:24] wrong. And if he doesn't tell me what's
[1:17:26] wrong, nothing's wrong.
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] Praise God.
[1:17:33] You say, "Oh, I don't want to be a
[1:17:34] fool." I'd rather be a happy fool.
[1:17:37] Than a gloomy fool.
[1:17:42] I'd rather be a happy fool, ignorant.
[1:17:45] Everybody else can look at you say,
[1:17:46] "Your life is all messed up, but I'm
[1:17:48] happy anyhow."
[1:17:51] rather than overanalyzing, coming too
[1:17:53] critical and trying to analyze
[1:17:55] everything that happens and become doom
[1:17:57] and gloom and everything's bad and yes,
[1:18:02] we'll never have victory in this battle
[1:18:04] that way. Always be defeated.
[1:18:08] Brother Brandham says in Blind
[1:18:09] Barnameus, don't think sitting there in
[1:18:12] a wheelchair that you're hopeless,
[1:18:15] helpless. You're not.
[1:18:18] Don't let that negative thought ever
[1:18:21] pass through. Don't let it anchor. You
[1:18:24] can't help it from going through your
[1:18:25] mind. That's right. But don't let it
[1:18:27] stop. Like the farmer said, "I can't
[1:18:30] keep the birds from flying over my
[1:18:31] place." But he had a double barrel
[1:18:33] shotgun. Said, "I can sure keep them
[1:18:35] from roosting."
[1:18:37] So you do the same thing. And you two
[1:18:39] see, don't let them roost. Let them pass
[1:18:41] right on through. Now, here's the
[1:18:43] shotgun to use, both New and Old
[1:18:45] Testament. A double barrel. Very good,
[1:18:47] too. I'll tell you, it keeps them away.
[1:18:52] Amen. Mother Bam taught us the simplest
[1:18:54] lessons that change our everyday life
[1:18:57] and give us victory in every battle of
[1:19:00] our life. Here's a woman sitting in a
[1:19:02] wheelchair. Amen. Uh you sitting in the
[1:19:05] wheelchair.
[1:19:08] Uh don't think you're hopeless and
[1:19:12] helpless. It doesn't matter what the
[1:19:14] situation is and what's going on in
[1:19:16] life. Don't ever start thinking hopeless
[1:19:18] and helpless. Your father God is the one
[1:19:21] who parted the Red Sea. He's the one who
[1:19:23] put a fish in a a coin in a fish's
[1:19:25] mouth. He's the one who walked on water
[1:19:27] and allowed Peter to Don't tell me it's
[1:19:29] hopeless. Don't tell me it's helpless.
[1:19:31] Don't tell me it'll never. Don't you
[1:19:33] ever say it'll never
[1:19:36] because you're not in control of
[1:19:38] eternity.
[1:19:40] Amen. It'll always be this. It doesn't
[1:19:42] mean it'll always be that way. You think
[1:19:44] positive.
[1:19:46] Think according to the word of God and
[1:19:48] don't and I love what he says.
[1:19:51] He says, "Don't let the negative thought
[1:19:53] ever pass through. Don't let it anchor."
[1:19:55] He corrects himself. Don't let it
[1:19:56] anchor. You can't help it from coming
[1:19:58] through your mind. You're a human being
[1:20:00] with a human mind. And the devil's got
[1:20:02] access. Amen. He can, Brother Bam said,
[1:20:04] he can plant thoughts in your mind. He
[1:20:05] can't read your mind, but he can put
[1:20:06] thoughts in your mind.
[1:20:12] So if the devil can put thoughts in your
[1:20:14] mind, why in the world would you accept
[1:20:17] every thought that comes in your mind?
[1:20:21] We better be careful what we think about
[1:20:24] and we better be careful what we agree
[1:20:26] with.
[1:20:29] You get a woman at home and her and her
[1:20:30] husband maybe he's had a bad day and
[1:20:32] maybe something's not going right and he
[1:20:34] gets a little short with his wife and
[1:20:35] he'll say something maybe a little sharp
[1:20:37] and maybe he he he whatever happened he
[1:20:39] shouldn't have said it this way but he
[1:20:40] says something a little sharp, a little
[1:20:42] coarse and he just doesn't spend time
[1:20:43] and he doesn't make it up right away.
[1:20:45] You let the devil get to that woman and
[1:20:47] start putting in her mind that her
[1:20:48] husband doesn't love her the way he used
[1:20:50] to
[1:20:53] and my your husband doesn't love you
[1:20:55] like he used to and and and then well
[1:20:58] those those other men at church they
[1:21:00] treat their wife so good and say so and
[1:21:01] all of a sudden the devil starts
[1:21:02] bringing negative and negative and
[1:21:04] negative and before long what would have
[1:21:06] been easily reconciled the next time he
[1:21:08] passed through and says listen I'm sorry
[1:21:09] about what I said earlier today or the
[1:21:11] day before all of a sudden there's
[1:21:12] something worked up in your mind that
[1:21:14] when he comes through and tries to make
[1:21:15] it right. You're so negative and gloomy
[1:21:17] and doomy and already mistrust him and
[1:21:20] don't believe him till he can't even
[1:21:22] make it right.
[1:21:24] That's the way the devil works in our
[1:21:26] minds. But if you'll throw that away and
[1:21:29] says, "He loves me like he's always
[1:21:31] loved me. He's having a bad day."
[1:21:33] Listen, get positive. Say, "And if he
[1:21:35] doesn't love me, I'll love him the rest
[1:21:37] of his life because I made a commitment
[1:21:39] to."
[1:21:40] Don't let the devil play games in our
[1:21:43] minds.
[1:21:45] Take those thoughts, bring them subject,
[1:21:47] captive, subject to Christ. Don't focus
[1:21:50] on It's so easy to focus on the
[1:21:52] negative. There's plenty of negative to
[1:21:53] focus where. It takes more spiritual
[1:21:55] strength to move yourself to the
[1:21:57] positive.
[1:21:58] Be a soldier.
[1:22:01] Let not your heart faint.
[1:22:03] Don't let your heart be troubled. Be a
[1:22:06] soldier. Quit being a victim.
[1:22:10] Be a soldier. Amen. Don't be like the
[1:22:14] other slaves. Be a son of the king.
[1:22:18] Don't gloom and don't doom and don't
[1:22:20] mllyrub and don't don't pout. You hold
[1:22:22] your head high. You move and face life
[1:22:24] the next day because you're the son and
[1:22:26] daughter of a king.
[1:22:28] Your father is God, the creator of
[1:22:30] heavens and earth. Amen. What do you
[1:22:31] have to be sorrowful for?
[1:22:34] Let's be happy. It's amazing how when
[1:22:36] you start thinking positive and
[1:22:38] expecting positive things to happen,
[1:22:40] positive things begin to happen.
[1:22:43] And how many times when you expect
[1:22:44] negative things to happen, negative
[1:22:46] things start to happen. It's amazing.
[1:22:54] I want to finish with this. Musicians,
[1:22:56] if you want to come, Brother John.
[1:23:00] Let the words of my mouth and the
[1:23:02] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[1:23:05] thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my
[1:23:09] redeemer.
[1:23:11] Of all that I've said and all that we've
[1:23:13] went through, if you could just grab
[1:23:15] this little scripture and make it a
[1:23:16] refrigerator thing, a phone thing, a a
[1:23:19] whatever, a little note. Let the words
[1:23:22] of my mouth and the meditation of my
[1:23:25] heart be acceptable in my sight, oh
[1:23:28] Lord. If we could do that, we'll have
[1:23:31] victory in our lives. We'll think on
[1:23:34] him. We'll think on his word. We'll
[1:23:36] think on the truth because that's the
[1:23:38] meditation of my heart that's pleasing
[1:23:40] to him. And if those thoughts become
[1:23:43] words out of my mouth, then it will
[1:23:45] create the atmosphere around me. and the
[1:23:47] atmosphere around me will bring to pass
[1:23:49] the very things that I'm thinking about
[1:23:52] because it's the word and the word has
[1:23:54] life and the word has power and we are
[1:23:57] sons and daughters of God. Let's all
[1:24:00] stand together.
[1:24:03] I just thank God for his word.
[1:24:06] And in 1962, brother Brenham thought we
[1:24:09] were all lined up and ready getting
[1:24:10] ready to go into the great ready to go
[1:24:13] into this great battle that's about to
[1:24:14] break out. And I'm telling you now, the
[1:24:16] battle's going on. Amen. It's going on
[1:24:19] in the minds of man. But there's a
[1:24:22] people who's predestinated to overcome.
[1:24:24] That's why God lifted you up and showed
[1:24:26] you. That's why he broke the amnesia.
[1:24:29] That's why you heard the eagle scream.
[1:24:31] And that's why you know who your father
[1:24:33] is, that you're the son and daughter of
[1:24:35] a king, so that you can overcome in this
[1:24:38] earth. Without that revelation, we just
[1:24:41] get tossed around like everybody else
[1:24:42] gets tossed around. But with that
[1:24:44] revelation, though you sit in prison,
[1:24:47] you can sing.
[1:24:50] Amen. Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord
[1:24:53] Jesus, we're so thankful, Father, for
[1:24:55] your word. And God, you've been so kind
[1:24:59] to us to open your mind in this end time
[1:25:01] and share your word with us, to send a
[1:25:03] prophet to preach the gospel, to give us
[1:25:06] opportunities like this, Lord, to come
[1:25:07] and hear the truth. And may the truth
[1:25:10] dispel all the lies that we've believed.
[1:25:12] May your word be the only thing that
[1:25:14] matters. May your word be what we focus
[1:25:16] our attention on. May this end time
[1:25:18] truth consume our thoughts. And may it
[1:25:20] be the meditation of our hearts. And
[1:25:23] God, we want to take your word as a
[1:25:25] double barrel shotgun and blow out,
[1:25:27] Lord, all these negative thoughts that
[1:25:28] are flying through our minds. And God,
[1:25:30] help us not to allow them to roost, not
[1:25:32] to give them permission to stay, but may
[1:25:35] we fight against it, Lord. God, may we
[1:25:38] may we begin as soldiers overcoming the
[1:25:41] battle, Lord. Because we know there's
[1:25:43] two forces at work. There's a negative
[1:25:45] and a positive. There's an enemy, but
[1:25:46] it's you, God, who is working on our
[1:25:49] behalf. You're our strength, and you're
[1:25:50] our life. And you've given us your word.
[1:25:53] And Lord, help us to focus on that. God,
[1:25:56] forgive us where we've been negative.
[1:25:58] Forgive us, Lord, where we've spoke
[1:25:59] negative and created negative
[1:26:01] atmospheres. But help us, God, to remain
[1:26:04] in the truth. I love you, Lord. Pray
[1:26:07] that you bless your people.
[1:26:09] May the things we heard tonight be
[1:26:11] applicable tonight on the way home, in
[1:26:14] the morning when we wake up, at work,
[1:26:16] and wherever we go. May there be an
[1:26:18] application, Lord, not just a hearing,
[1:26:20] but a doing of your word. And may we put
[1:26:23] it into practice, and in practice, may
[1:26:25] it begin to conquer and overcome. And
[1:26:27] may we see changes, Lord, all around us
[1:26:30] because your word is forever the truth.
[1:26:32] God, I pray that there's many here that
[1:26:35] would find more victory in their lives
[1:26:37] because they captivate the thoughts that
[1:26:39] are negative and they focus on the ones
[1:26:42] that are true. And God, may you have a
[1:26:45] great victory in each one of us by your
[1:26:47] word. May Lord, the channel of our minds
[1:26:50] line up to your word and may we become a
[1:26:52] conduit that you can just flow through
[1:26:54] in manifestation.
[1:26:56] For God, you've given us free moral
[1:26:57] agency. We can choose what we focus on.
[1:27:01] We can choose what we accept. We can
[1:27:04] choose to accept it as truth or reject
[1:27:06] it as a lie. We can choose to focus on
[1:27:08] it or ignore it. We can choose to focus
[1:27:11] on the negative or ch focus on your
[1:27:13] word. Help us Lord by the power of your
[1:27:15] spirit to focus on your word, on the
[1:27:18] truth. Lord, bless your people as we go
[1:27:20] home. Keep us all by your grace. And
[1:27:23] Lord, let us be joyful. Let us rise in
[1:27:27] the morning joyful because your word is
[1:27:30] true.
[1:27:31] because we know who we are, God. We can
[1:27:34] find ourselves like that African man far
[1:27:36] from home in a place he didn't want to
[1:27:38] be. But Lord, he could lift his head on
[1:27:41] high and carry himself as the son of a
[1:27:43] king because he was. And Lord, we're
[1:27:47] here in a sin-cursed earth. We're in a
[1:27:49] place, Lord, that's not easy to live.
[1:27:51] There's many constraints and
[1:27:53] difficulties, and it's taxing on body
[1:27:55] and taxing on mind. But oh God, how we
[1:27:58] can lift our voices in praise. We can
[1:28:00] lift our heads above it all and act like
[1:28:02] sons and daughters of a king because we
[1:28:04] are. Not because we hope to be, but
[1:28:07] because we are. We can act like we're
[1:28:10] free from all the circumstances because
[1:28:12] we are. Not because we hope to be, but
[1:28:14] because we actually are free. We're free
[1:28:18] from every vice of the enemy. We're free
[1:28:20] from every false doctrine and teaching
[1:28:22] and every false idea. We're a free
[1:28:25] people. Help us to rejoice like a free
[1:28:28] people. Help us to be happy like a free
[1:28:31] people. We love you, God. We ask your
[1:28:34] blessings upon this word. In Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:28:40] Amen. God bless you all. I also want to
[1:28:43] welcome Sister Tony. Sister Tony
[1:28:44] Cornelen. She was here Sunday. Her son
[1:28:47] and grandson moved her in and got her
[1:28:49] here. She's she's officially a Lima
[1:28:52] resident. God bless you, Sister Tony.
[1:28:59] I saw her in the service, but I didn't
[1:29:01] recognize her with her son and her
[1:29:02] grandson. I wasn't certain, but I found
[1:29:04] out afterwards. So, God bless you,
[1:29:05] Sister Tony, and welcome. Amen. God
[1:29:07] bless you all, Brother John.
[1:29:11] Thanks. Thanks.
[1:29:14] I give you thanks
[1:29:17] for all
[1:29:19] you've
[1:29:20] done.
