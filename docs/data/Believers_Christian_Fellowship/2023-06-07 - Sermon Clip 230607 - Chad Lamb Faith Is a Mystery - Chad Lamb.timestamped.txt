[0:00] when they had heard that he was alive
[0:02] and had been seen of her believed not
[0:06] they were disbelieving the manifestation
[0:08] of their hour
[0:13] after that after they disbelieved
[0:17] after that he appeared in another form
[0:19] and the two of them as they walked and
[0:22] went in the country and they went and
[0:23] told it unto the residue neither believe
[0:26] they them
[0:28] so we have the mouth of two witnesses
[0:30] and they're not believing
[0:34] so what does God do with his
[0:36] predestinated seed who's not believing
[0:38] does he cast them away does he does he
[0:40] chasten them and say you're no longer
[0:42] part of me you get away from me no he
[0:45] can't cast him away no matter what their
[0:47] stupidity or unbelief is because they
[0:49] were part of him before the foundation
[0:51] of the world their names were put in the
[0:53] Lamb's Book of Life he can't cast them
[0:55] away brother bam said he would he would
[0:57] get rid of us for our stupidity
[1:02] I've had some stupidity
[1:05] but he can't get rid of me amen he can't
[1:08] cast me away because he chose me for the
[1:10] foundation of the world
[1:11] so here it's two the the first group
[1:14] comes back with the testimony he's alive
[1:16] they believe it not the two on the road
[1:18] to mass come back with the testimony
[1:19] he's alive they believe it not
[1:22] in verse 14.
[1:24] afterward he appeared unto the eleven
[1:28] now he came to them himself
[1:34] I'm telling you it's good to be elect
[1:37] it's good to be elect amen it's good to
[1:40] be part of the program because no matter
[1:42] what you said when you first heard the
[1:43] message or what foolish statement you
[1:45] made or how you didn't believe this
[1:47] crazy thing your neighbor or your friend
[1:48] or your co-worker or somebody else
[1:50] taught you amen but down inside of you
[1:53] was a predestinated seed Gene of God
[1:55] that he wasn't going to lose amen so
[1:58] somewhere along the line if you didn't
[1:59] believe this testimony and didn't
[2:01] believe that testimony somewhere along
[2:03] the line he would come to you
[2:11] after Rudy appeared unto the 11 as they
[2:13] sat at me and unbraided them with their
[2:16] unbelief
[2:18] and hardness of harm because they
[2:20] believe not them which had seen him
[2:21] after he was risen he embraded them he
[2:25] rebuked him he corrected them
[2:27] and then what did he do
[2:29] he said go you into all the world and
[2:31] preach the gospel to Every Creature
[2:32] you're still mine and I still got a job
[2:34] for you to do you're still part of the
[2:36] program you're still part of the promise
[2:38] you're still my seed you're still the
[2:40] manifestation of the hour that caused me
[2:42] to come to you myself
[2:47] praise God Almighty it's good to be
[2:49] elect friends
[2:52] I mean we've done all the foolishness
[2:53] thing the world has done we've done all
[2:55] the foolish things the denominations
[2:56] have done the difference is
[2:58] predestination the difference is
[3:00] election
[3:02] and that election didn't allow him to
[3:04] throw us away that election wouldn't
[3:06] allow him to to go seek another that
[3:08] election would bring him to us in a
[3:11] personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:12] himself revealed personally amen
[3:16] Amen to us
