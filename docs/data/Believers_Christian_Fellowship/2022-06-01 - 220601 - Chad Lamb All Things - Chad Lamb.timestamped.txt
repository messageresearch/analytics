[12:59] before so we should be here for that
[13:01] service so be remembering those brothers
[13:04] in prayer remember the service is coming
[13:05] up and i'm excited to hear what they'll
[13:07] be preaching amen we look forward to
[13:10] hearing the word
[13:11] man let's read together hebrews chapter
[13:14] 5
[13:15] verse 8 and 9 and then we'll let you
[13:16] have your seeds hebrews chapter 5 verse
[13:19] 8 and 9.
[13:21] the though he were a son
[13:23] yet learned he obedience by the things
[13:25] which he suffered
[13:27] and being made perfect he became the
[13:29] author of eternal salvation and to all
[13:32] them that obey him amen you can be
[13:35] seated
[13:36] we'll ask the lord to bless us as we
[13:37] look into his word and the lord will
[13:39] open his word unto us
[13:42] in this scripture i just wanted to point
[13:43] out in verse 8 that he learned obedience
[13:46] so we have here that though he were a
[13:49] son yet he learned so there was
[13:51] something that he was learning and i
[13:53] want to highlight that because of this
[13:55] this quote that i want to go into out of
[13:57] who is this melchizedek from 1965
[14:00] and i was uh i was either reading or
[14:02] listening to this and i and it sent me
[14:04] down a path i was thinking and the lord
[14:06] just began to deal with me in a certain
[14:08] way and it's a simple thought but it
[14:10] became very profound to me
[14:12] and uh and the message was this
[14:14] melchizedek starting in paragraph 67
[14:17] he said now we see the attribute sons of
[14:19] his spirit have not yet entered into the
[14:21] word form body but a theophany this body
[14:24] is subject to the word in earnest
[14:27] waiting for the earnest change of the
[14:29] body
[14:30] now the difference between him and you
[14:32] as a son see he was at the beginning the
[14:35] word and morphy body he came and lived
[14:38] in that in the person of melchizedek
[14:40] then later we never heard no more
[14:42] melchizedek because he became jesus
[14:44] christ
[14:46] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[14:48] jesus christ now you bypassed that
[14:51] because in that form he knowed all
[14:54] things and you have never been able to
[14:56] know that yet
[14:58] so i started looking that in that form
[15:00] he knowed all things and jesus didn't
[15:02] bypass this theophany but he came with
[15:04] his theophany so jesus knew all things
[15:08] and i started looking at that and so i
[15:10] wanted to title this this evening all
[15:12] things
[15:14] and and then it goes on to say you come
[15:17] like adam
[15:18] like me
[15:19] you become from the attribute to the
[15:21] flesh to be tempted but when this life
[15:23] is finished here if this earthly
[15:25] tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[15:27] already waiting that's where we go that
[15:29] is the word then we can look back and
[15:32] see what we've done now we don't
[15:33] understand it we have never become the
[15:36] word we've just become the flesh man not
[15:38] the word
[15:39] but and look clearly makes it clear you
[15:42] will never be the word unless you was a
[15:44] thought at the beginning
[15:46] remember goes from thought to word word
[15:48] made manifest word expressed
[15:50] you never be the word unless you was a
[15:52] thought at the beginning that proves the
[15:54] predestination of god see you can't be
[15:57] the word unless you're a thought you had
[15:59] to be in his thinking first
[16:02] but you see in order to stand temptation
[16:04] you had to bypass the theophany you had
[16:07] to come down here in flesh to be tempted
[16:09] by sin and then if you stand all the
[16:12] father hath given me will come to me and
[16:14] i'll raise him up at the last day see
[16:17] you had to be first
[16:20] amen so now he's telling us
[16:22] we had to bypass our theophany because
[16:25] in that form he knowed all things so we
[16:27] couldn't come knowing all things because
[16:29] we had to come to be tempted by sin
[16:32] amen we're on the same page
[16:35] so we had to come to be tempted by sin
[16:37] but jesus didn't bypasses the often he
[16:39] came with us theophany in that form he
[16:42] knowed all things but there was two
[16:44] other scriptures that i looked at and a
[16:46] quote that caused me to ask this
[16:47] question and i'm going to ask in a
[16:49] minute let's turn to matthew chapter 24
[16:52] together
[16:55] matthew chapter 24.
[17:04] in matthew chapter 24
[17:07] they asked jesus uh um three questions
[17:10] and he begins to answer them but when he
[17:12] gets to this one he says in verse 36
[17:14] matthew 24 36
[17:17] he says but of that day and hour knoweth
[17:20] no man no not the angels of heaven but
[17:23] my father only
[17:25] and brother branham
[17:27] he refers to this scripture and christ
[17:29] is the mystery of god revealed and he
[17:31] says god's great mystery of how it's a
[17:34] secret
[17:35] he kept it a secret nobody knowed
[17:36] anything about it even the angels didn't
[17:39] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[17:41] that's the reason under our seventh
[17:43] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[17:45] there was silence jesus when he was on
[17:47] earth they wanted to know when he would
[17:49] come he said it's even the son himself
[17:51] don't know when it's going to happen
[17:54] see god has this all to himself it's a
[17:57] secret
[17:58] and i listened that quote and i read
[18:00] that verse and i thought but he didn't
[18:02] bypass this theophany he came with his
[18:04] theophany and he knows all things but
[18:07] brother brahm said he didn't know this
[18:10] and the scripture says he learned
[18:12] obedience
[18:13] and i thought what does it mean to know
[18:15] all things maybe to know all things
[18:17] doesn't mean what i think it means
[18:20] maybe to know all things could mean
[18:21] something different than what i think to
[18:23] know all things means because brother
[18:25] branham said he didn't know this the son
[18:27] didn't know that's just the father
[18:29] and let's go to one more scripture in
[18:30] luke 2 luke chapter 2.
[18:38] luke chapter 2
[18:40] and verse 41.
[18:49] luke chapter 2 verse 41
[18:52] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[18:54] year at the feast of the passover
[18:57] and when he was 12 years old they went
[18:59] up to jerusalem after the custom of the
[19:00] feast
[19:01] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[19:03] they returned the child jesus teared
[19:05] behind in jerusalem and joseph and his
[19:08] mother knew not of it
[19:10] but they supposing him to have been in
[19:12] the company went a day's journey and
[19:14] they sought him among their kinsfolk and
[19:16] acquaintance and acquaintance
[19:18] and when they found him not they turned
[19:20] back again to jerusalem seeking him and
[19:23] it came to pass that after three days
[19:24] they found him in the temple sitting in
[19:26] the midst of the doctors both hearing
[19:28] them and asking them questions and all
[19:32] that heard him were astonished at his
[19:33] understanding and answers and when they
[19:36] saw him they were amazed and his mother
[19:38] said unto him son why hast thou thus
[19:41] dealt with us behold thy father and i
[19:43] have sought thee with sorrow i sought
[19:46] thee sorrowing and he said unto them how
[19:48] is it that you sought me wished you not
[19:51] that i must be about my father's
[19:52] business
[19:54] and they understood not the saying which
[19:55] he spake unto them and he went down with
[19:58] them and came to nazareth and was
[19:59] subject unto them but his mother kept
[20:02] all these sayings in her heart
[20:04] and jesus increased in wisdom
[20:07] there's another one of those statements
[20:10] and he increased in wisdom and stature
[20:13] and in favor with god and man
[20:15] so now we know from who is this
[20:17] melchizedek that jesus christ he did not
[20:19] bypass his theophany but he came with
[20:21] his theophany and we couldn't come that
[20:24] way because in that form we would know
[20:25] all things and so jesus christ comes but
[20:28] we know that that
[20:30] at 12 he went down to nazars with them
[20:32] and subjected himself to his earthly
[20:35] parents and and it says he increased in
[20:37] wisdom we know that he learned obedience
[20:40] and we know that that brother branham
[20:42] said that there was something that the
[20:44] son did not know only the father but we
[20:46] know that he knew all things
[20:48] did he believe that he knew all things
[20:51] i say he knew all things and if i could
[20:53] say it this way he knew everything that
[20:56] he needed to know amen he knew all the
[20:58] important things and he may not have
[21:00] known every single detail and all the
[21:03] facts and all the figures and all the
[21:05] information but he knew all things
[21:08] because when you look at him in the
[21:09] temple at 12 years old jesus now knows
[21:13] who his father
[21:14] is amen he knows who his father is we
[21:18] have no there's no scripture there's no
[21:20] indication of scripture that jesus ever
[21:22] received an angelic visitation of a
[21:25] messenger that would tell him who he is
[21:26] amen he just knew who he was amen he
[21:29] knew who his father was if he knew who
[21:31] his father was then he knew who he was
[21:33] he was the son of god
[21:35] and he knew he knew what his father's
[21:36] business was because he said i must be
[21:39] about my father's business so he knew
[21:41] who his father was he knew who he was he
[21:43] knew what the father's business was and
[21:46] he knew how to rightly divide the word
[21:49] because when he was talking with the
[21:50] doctors amen and the
[21:52] and all the theologians they were
[21:54] astonished at his understanding he was
[21:57] they were asking him questions he was
[21:59] listening to them and he was asking them
[22:01] questions and they were astonished at
[22:03] his understanding and we know for for
[22:05] sure that jesus was the word and jesus
[22:08] knew the word amen when he was 12 years
[22:10] old he knew the word amen but two taught
[22:13] it to him
[22:15] which messenger came to him who was
[22:18] jesus who was he taught by who was he
[22:20] listening to amen
[22:23] he knew all things he didn't bypass his
[22:25] theophany
[22:27] do you believe that
[22:29] so now when i look at that i realize
[22:32] when he knew who he was
[22:35] and he knew who his father was and he
[22:37] knew what his father's business was and
[22:39] he knew the word he knew all things amen
[22:42] and if you know that you don't need all
[22:44] the facts you know all things amen you
[22:47] don't need to know if it's going to rain
[22:48] tomorrow amen you don't need to know
[22:50] amen what's going to happen in your bank
[22:51] account tomorrow you don't need to know
[22:54] everything that's going to happen in
[22:55] your life all you need to know is the
[22:58] all things amen and if you know that
[23:00] everything is fine
[23:02] because the the one if you know who you
[23:06] are who your father is
[23:09] if you know what the father's business
[23:11] is and what your purpose in life is and
[23:13] you know that word for your day you know
[23:15] all things too amen and you don't need
[23:18] to know amen lord what will happen
[23:20] tomorrow in this situation what will
[23:21] happen tomorrow and this is which
[23:22] situation you don't need to know that
[23:25] you know all things because the all
[23:27] things that you know tell you that
[23:29] you're serving god's purpose and you
[23:31] have a father who's watching over you
[23:33] and the word has given you promises that
[23:35] you can apply and you know when i get to
[23:37] tomorrow tomorrow will be fine amen when
[23:40] i get to any situation every situation
[23:42] will be fine i don't need to know all
[23:44] the details i just need to know all
[23:46] things
[23:50] i just need to know
[23:52] where i came from
[23:54] who my father is who i am where i'm
[23:57] going and what what's the purpose for
[23:59] god in this day and if you know that you
[24:02] know enough to conquer every storm you
[24:04] know enough to overcome every trial you
[24:06] know enough amen to never be defeated by
[24:09] the devil
[24:10] what else do you want to know
[24:15] if you know who you are
[24:17] where you came from
[24:19] who your father is
[24:21] where you're going what your purpose is
[24:23] and what the correct interpretation of
[24:25] the word is
[24:27] what else do you need to know
[24:29] i would say you know all things amen
[24:33] amen let's look at this in the scripture
[24:34] let's look at john chapter 4.
[24:41] when i begin to meditate on this and
[24:43] think about the things brother branham
[24:44] said in the scriptures and the life of
[24:46] jesus christ amen and him not bypassing
[24:50] his theophany
[24:52] i begin to realize knowing all things
[24:54] isn't what i thought knowing all things
[24:56] was
[24:57] my definition interpretation of knowing
[24:59] all things
[25:01] was wrong
[25:03] and it had to be adjusted
[25:05] look at john chapter 4 now verse 19.
[25:11] the woman saith unto him sir i perceive
[25:13] that art a prophet we know in john
[25:16] chapter 4 here we're dealing with the
[25:17] woman at the well the samaritan woman
[25:19] where jesus had deeds to go by samaria
[25:22] so jesus took a a route that was
[25:26] intended he had need to go this route
[25:28] amen because he had an interaction that
[25:30] needed to take place with the woman at
[25:32] the well and he begins to discern her
[25:34] life and the woman said i perceived that
[25:36] that were the prophet then she says
[25:38] verse 20 our fathers worshiped in this
[25:40] mountain and you say that in jerusalem
[25:42] is the place where men ought to worship
[25:45] jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[25:48] hour cometh when you shall neither in
[25:50] this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[25:52] worship the father
[25:54] ye worship you know not what
[25:57] we know what we worship for salvation is
[25:59] of the jews but the hour cometh and now
[26:02] is when the true worship worshiper shall
[26:04] worship the father in spirit and in
[26:06] truth for the father seek as such to
[26:08] worship him
[26:10] god is a spirit
[26:12] and they that worship him must worship
[26:15] him in spirit and in truth
[26:19] and the woman said unto him
[26:21] i know that messiahs cometh which is
[26:23] called christ when he has come he will
[26:26] tell us all things
[26:29] what did jesus just tell her he began to
[26:32] tell her the proper place of worship he
[26:34] began to tell her the day and hour that
[26:35] she was living in and he began to
[26:37] discern her and she began she says when
[26:39] messiahs come which is christ he will
[26:41] tell us all things amen and the question
[26:44] is did jesus tell them all things
[26:47] absolutely but it may not be all things
[26:49] like we thought all things was he told
[26:52] them everything they needed to know to
[26:54] identify their day and to identify
[26:56] themselves amen they could identify the
[26:59] day that they were living in and if they
[27:00] could identify the day that they were
[27:02] living in and identify him and identify
[27:04] the faith that they'd received they
[27:06] could identify themselves and then they
[27:08] would know all things
[27:11] so she says the messiah cometh he is
[27:14] called christ and he has come he will
[27:16] tell us all things jesus saith unto her
[27:20] i that speak unto thee
[27:22] am he
[27:24] i am the one that will tell you
[27:27] all things
[27:29] brother branham
[27:31] tells us now
[27:32] that just like this woman at the well
[27:35] she bypassed her theophany
[27:38] and she was living
[27:42] a terrible life she had had five
[27:44] husbands the one that she was living
[27:45] with then was not her husband she would
[27:48] have been an immoral woman
[27:50] had a bad reputation a bad identity
[27:53] a bad reputation in the city
[27:56] who knows how she viewed herself or felt
[27:58] about herself amen but jesus had needs
[28:02] to go by because he had to tell this
[28:04] woman something because she had the
[28:06] wrong understanding of who she was and
[28:07] she had the wrong understanding of life
[28:09] and she had the wrong understanding of
[28:11] worship and then jesus was going to come
[28:13] by and begin to reveal all things and
[28:15] begin to tell her all things that she
[28:17] could break out of the life that she was
[28:19] in and break into the life amen to the
[28:22] person that she truly was
[28:24] her identity amen was masked was hidden
[28:28] was a mystery because of all the facts
[28:30] and all the information and all the
[28:32] details of her life but she was not she
[28:34] was missing the main details of her life
[28:37] she was missing the main information in
[28:39] her life had been withheld from her
[28:40] because she bypassed her theophany she
[28:43] came to the earth with spiritual amnesia
[28:45] amen and it was going to take this
[28:46] encounter with a living word that was
[28:48] going to begin to begin to break that
[28:50] amnesia so that she could identify what
[28:52] the all things really were
[28:55] she was going to get all the information
[28:57] she needed
[28:59] brother ben begins to say in the
[29:01] identification of christ in all ages
[29:04] it says look at that little woman see
[29:07] she had fallen from god's thoughts
[29:11] have you fallen from god's thoughts
[29:14] bypass the theophany she was a thought
[29:17] that was now in flesh
[29:20] she was a thought of god that was now in
[29:22] flesh
[29:23] but what she knew there
[29:26] was now darkness to her here
[29:29] what she knew because she bypassed her
[29:31] theophany she came straight she from the
[29:33] thoughts of gone she was now in flash
[29:36] and then when she was in flash although
[29:38] she was part of the thoughts of god she
[29:41] was that part was darkened to her in her
[29:43] human flesh and her human experience
[29:45] amen but god was going to come and
[29:47] brighten that area bring bring a
[29:49] revelation to her awaken the seed that
[29:52] was on the inside of her so that she
[29:54] would know the things that she needed to
[29:56] know
[29:57] so look at the little woman she had
[29:59] fallen from god's
[30:01] thoughts
[30:03] she could be redeemed
[30:05] she was a subject
[30:06] she had representation in heaven
[30:11] so because she was fallen from god's
[30:13] thoughts and she was now living in flesh
[30:16] she still had representation in heaven
[30:19] something was representing her in heaven
[30:22] she was a thought that was now in flash
[30:24] but she had representation in heaven now
[30:27] the thought and flash was shrouded in
[30:29] darkness and she didn't know who she was
[30:31] and where she came from and who her
[30:32] father was and what the purpose of her
[30:34] life was on earth she didn't know that
[30:36] but she had representation in heaven and
[30:38] now the word was coming to her
[30:40] the word was coming to her in her day
[30:43] and it says she turned around look at
[30:46] the difference between her and them
[30:47] preachers her priests and preachers when
[30:50] they saw it they said well this man is a
[30:52] fortune teller they didn't know the word
[30:55] now you can take and contrast this woman
[30:58] at the well with those with those
[31:00] pharisees and with those with her priest
[31:02] and you would say which one knew the
[31:04] word
[31:04] she would if you if you went by testing
[31:07] and by intellect and by education you
[31:09] would say this woman didn't know the
[31:11] word and all these priests would know
[31:13] the word but brother branham said they
[31:15] didn't know the word because when they
[31:16] encountered the word they didn't
[31:18] recognize it they didn't know it they
[31:20] did not have representation in heaven
[31:22] she had representation in heaven they
[31:25] were not a thought that fell from the
[31:26] thoughts of god she had fallen from the
[31:29] thoughts of god so that means she was
[31:31] part of that word she knew the word amen
[31:34] they didn't know the word she may never
[31:36] have passed the test she may never been
[31:38] able to write the essay they may have
[31:40] had all the intellectual understanding
[31:42] but they didn't know the word she knew
[31:44] the word because she came from the word
[31:45] she was part of the word her origin was
[31:48] the thoughts of god and now she's
[31:49] sitting here waiting to come in contact
[31:52] with the word so that the word can begin
[31:54] to tell her all things all things she
[31:57] needs to be a daughter of god all things
[31:59] she needs to break out of that life all
[32:01] things she needs to live the message for
[32:04] her day
[32:05] and i'll tell you what else did she need
[32:07] to know
[32:09] what else did she need to know
[32:12] he says she says i know that when
[32:14] messiahs come to jesus christ he'll tell
[32:16] us all things and he says i am he that
[32:18] speaks to ye
[32:21] so what was she receiving the person who
[32:23] was telling her all things
[32:26] and maybe just maybe
[32:28] all things
[32:30] are not every detail
[32:33] maybe to know all things doesn't mean
[32:36] that you're going to know what's going
[32:37] to happen tomorrow and next week and the
[32:39] week after and you'll be able to predict
[32:41] and you'll be able to this and that
[32:42] maybe that's not what you need to know
[32:46] maybe there's something else that we
[32:48] need to know
[32:50] he says
[32:51] he goes on to say they didn't know the
[32:53] word look what she said we know sir you
[32:56] must be a prophet we haven't had one for
[32:58] for hundreds of years and we know when
[33:00] messiah come that's what he's going to
[33:02] do oh my
[33:05] brother the bible says in the fourth
[33:08] seal
[33:09] he said here comes satan with all four
[33:12] corners of the earth with his
[33:13] protestants and his catholics and all
[33:15] together marching right up to the battle
[33:17] of armageddon so i just i just want to
[33:20] throw a side note in there so when when
[33:22] satan comes to the battle of armageddon
[33:24] he doesn't come with tanks and he
[33:26] doesn't come with armies he comes with
[33:28] protestants and catholics
[33:30] so what do you think this battle of
[33:31] armageddon is going to be like
[33:34] you gather not armies but you gather
[33:36] protestants and catholics there's a
[33:37] spiritual armageddon that's going on
[33:40] and he says all right and here comes
[33:42] jesus coming down from heaven with
[33:44] resurrected saints vindicated word
[33:47] so they were vindicated word and said if
[33:50] god speaks and sends you he backs up
[33:53] what you say see and if you're an
[33:55] ambassador from heaven all heaven's
[33:57] behind you and heaven is consisted of
[34:01] the word
[34:02] so what is heaven consisted of the word
[34:06] so if you have the word
[34:09] you have heaven
[34:11] if you have the full revelation of the
[34:13] full word what is separating you from
[34:16] heaven amen you have heaven heaven has
[34:19] been opened up in this day that's why
[34:21] there was a door open in heaven because
[34:23] there was a revelation of the word that
[34:24] was opening up because heaven consists
[34:26] of the word
[34:28] and the word's been opened up amen so
[34:31] there was a great revelation amen that
[34:33] links us to heaven because we know in
[34:35] the beginning was the word and the word
[34:37] was with god and the word was god so you
[34:40] don't separate god in the word so if you
[34:42] have the word what else do you need
[34:46] if you have the revelation of the word
[34:48] for your day what else do you need
[34:52] that's the question that's what i want
[34:54] us to walk away tonight walking out the
[34:57] door saying by the grace of god amen by
[35:00] by having representation in heaven and
[35:03] by having a seed down on the inside i
[35:05] have been able to receive amen the
[35:07] prophetic ministry of malachi 4 which
[35:09] told me that we have the correct
[35:11] interpretation with divine vindication
[35:13] we have the word we've been given all
[35:16] things in our age and i wanted us to
[35:18] walk out this door saying i have all
[35:21] things amen i'm not hunting i'm not
[35:23] looking for i have received all things
[35:26] and i need the all things to i need the
[35:29] all things to direct my whole life i
[35:30] need the all things that i received to
[35:32] give me all my information for living
[35:35] [Music]
[35:36] amen why because what do we receive all
[35:38] things
[35:41] amen
[35:43] this woman
[35:45] she could receive the message of the
[35:47] messiah because of two things
[35:50] because she had fallen from the thoughts
[35:52] of god
[35:53] and because she had representation in
[35:55] heaven
[35:57] those pharisees and sadducees they
[35:59] didn't have representation in heaven and
[36:01] brother branham said they didn't have
[36:03] anything to believe with
[36:06] because you don't believe with your
[36:07] brain
[36:09] they had a brain
[36:11] you don't believe with your emotional
[36:12] realm with your mind amen because they
[36:14] had all of that she had something they
[36:17] didn't have they had nothing to believe
[36:19] with she had something to believe with
[36:21] what did she have they didn't she had a
[36:23] seed gene of almighty god on the inside
[36:25] and she could believe with that they had
[36:27] nothing to believe with
[36:31] that's why she could receive the all
[36:33] things
[36:35] so
[36:36] we had to come
[36:39] not knowing all things
[36:42] so why did we come not knowing all
[36:44] things
[36:45] because we had to be tempted by sin
[36:49] what is sin unbelief
[36:51] so we had to be tempted by unbelief
[36:54] and we had to come not knowing all
[36:56] things because if we'd known all things
[36:57] we wouldn't have been tempted with
[36:58] unbelief
[37:00] so we had to come with that part
[37:02] darkened to us in our understanding and
[37:04] our intellectual human understanding
[37:06] amen so that we could be tempted by sin
[37:09] so that so there could be an awakening
[37:11] and a receiving of all things and
[37:13] overcoming for the day that we live in
[37:16] and if we ever overcome in this day and
[37:18] receive the messiah for our day it'll be
[37:20] because there's two things working in
[37:22] our life one because we fell from the
[37:24] thoughts of god and two we have
[37:26] representation in heaven
[37:28] and if you fell from the thoughts of god
[37:30] and you have representation in heaven
[37:32] and by that god is able to give you a
[37:34] revelation of the word for your day what
[37:36] else do you want
[37:38] what are we looking for what are we
[37:39] waiting for what what else do we need to
[37:42] overcome we have everything we need to
[37:44] overcome every situation that will come
[37:46] our way
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] brother bam said in the message
[37:50] spiritual amnesia
[37:51] said you that wants the holy spirit you
[37:54] that wants the experience not an
[37:55] emotional excitement you want the holy
[37:58] ghost the life the germ of life inside
[38:00] you and you want to get rid of that
[38:02] amnesia that makes you you can't
[38:04] identify yourself
[38:06] you don't know where you stand you don't
[38:08] know what you are let's get rid of it
[38:11] right now there is a new birth here for
[38:13] you a real genuine new birth
[38:16] what will the new birth do quicken the
[38:18] seed inside of you amen and bring to
[38:20] life amen the believing ability that's
[38:23] inside of you to believe the word of god
[38:25] and to act on the word of god and
[38:27] receive all things
[38:33] amen i want to read it i want to read
[38:35] just a couple more things before i make
[38:36] this comment
[38:38] and the message who is this melchizedek
[38:41] it says then after you recognize the
[38:43] very word of god was eagle food then you
[38:46] left the other thing you have been
[38:47] formed into the living image of the
[38:49] living god
[38:50] you heard from your theophany
[38:54] that statement is so exciting to me
[38:58] because if i can hear from my theophany
[39:01] it means i have a theophany
[39:06] and i have a if i have a theophany then
[39:09] i have representation in heaven
[39:12] and if i have representation in heaven
[39:14] then i have fallen from the thoughts of
[39:16] god and if i've fallen from the thoughts
[39:18] of god then i'm part of the thoughts of
[39:19] god that means i'm part of the word
[39:22] that means i can't be lost
[39:24] that means i can't miss it that means i
[39:27] can't be left behind
[39:28] amen that's because i'm predestinated
[39:31] i'm part of god amen i'm part of that
[39:33] word amen in all heavens consists of the
[39:35] word amen what are the believers the
[39:37] words in the book amen what's in heaven
[39:40] the word who's the word the believers
[39:44] amen
[39:45] then you heard from your theophany
[39:48] listen i i get more excited about this
[39:51] day by day amen because without this
[39:54] there's no hope for us amen without this
[39:57] we would never have received the message
[40:02] he says
[40:04] when you recognize the very word of god
[40:06] was eagle food
[40:08] and you left the other thing
[40:11] you turn from everything else and you
[40:13] begin to eat the eagle food
[40:16] you recognize there's nothing there
[40:18] nothing there nothing there nothing
[40:20] there i i i heard the very word of god
[40:24] and i knew it was eagle food and i
[40:25] turned from everything else and began to
[40:27] feed on this then you left the other
[40:29] thing you have been formed into the
[40:31] living image of god you heard from your
[40:33] theophany if this earthly body be
[40:35] dissolved we have one waiting
[40:39] praise be to god and listen if i heard
[40:42] from my theophany when i received this
[40:44] message then i had to have a theophany
[40:46] before i received the message
[40:51] and i'll tell you
[40:53] i had representation in heaven
[40:57] [Music]
[40:59] in the message god's provided way of
[41:01] healing he says this is from 1954 but i
[41:03] want you to catch this quote i've quoted
[41:05] it once here before
[41:06] it says now we can preach the word
[41:09] explain the word
[41:11] but you have to receive the word
[41:14] so we can preach it we can explain it
[41:15] but you have to receive the word
[41:17] and that's what sets that's what sets it
[41:20] a fire brother when you receive it the
[41:22] revelation
[41:24] something slips out of the unseen world
[41:26] yonder and comes rolling down through a
[41:29] mystical channel somewhere
[41:33] into your soul
[41:35] that says
[41:36] now i see it
[41:38] amen
[41:40] something slips out of the unseen world
[41:44] world yonder comes rolling down through
[41:47] a mystical channel somewhere
[41:50] into your soul and says
[41:54] now i see it
[41:56] what brought a revelation there's a
[41:58] mystical channel and something from the
[42:00] ncaa world come rolling down that
[42:01] mystical channel dropped into the soul
[42:04] to bring a revelation said now i seen it
[42:06] so how did you see it when you saw that
[42:08] this was eagle food you heard from your
[42:09] theophany so your theophany's on the
[42:11] other end of the mystical channel on
[42:14] this end of the mystical channel is the
[42:16] sea gene of god the thought of god that
[42:18] fell from the something that fallen from
[42:20] the thoughts of god's here on the other
[42:22] end of that mystical channel is the
[42:24] theophany and these two together are
[42:26] feeding all things into your soul
[42:32] let's look at matthew 18 10.
[42:39] this next thought just thrills me
[42:46] matthew 18 verse 10.
[42:52] matthew 18 verse 10
[42:57] take heed that you despise not one of
[43:00] these little ones
[43:01] for i say unto you that in heaven their
[43:04] angels do always behold the face of my
[43:07] father
[43:08] which is in heaven
[43:12] that in heaven their angels do always
[43:15] behold the face of my father which is in
[43:17] heaven
[43:19] what little ones are he talking about
[43:20] he's not talking about little children
[43:21] he's talking about the little ones of
[43:22] the kingdom that believe
[43:25] any little one that believeth on me he's
[43:27] talking about the believers amen
[43:30] so
[43:31] the believers he says don't offend one
[43:33] of these little ones the believers
[43:36] for their angel always beholds
[43:39] the face of my father which is in heaven
[43:42] brother brennan's asked the questions in
[43:44] 1964 from questions and answers said
[43:46] explain about each person's angel who
[43:48] abides with them from birth unto death
[43:51] brother bram says very good question
[43:54] and he goes down and he says explain he
[43:56] reads it again explain about each
[43:57] person's angel who abides with them from
[43:59] birth now if you'll notice now this is
[44:01] pretty deep
[44:02] now i i never i just picked it up part
[44:05] of its wrote and type and the other
[44:06] one's in pencil or pen now there is an
[44:08] angel but this angel to the lord that
[44:10] are encamped about those that fear them
[44:12] that fears him now it isn't promised
[44:14] that sinners has angels
[44:17] so we're talking about a different kind
[44:18] of angel amen they're not the sinners
[44:21] doesn't have angels it's only the
[44:23] redeemed has angels
[44:26] did you know that the angels of the lord
[44:28] and camp about those that fear him now
[44:30] angels are messengers i want you to
[44:33] notice it's so perfect and it'll prove
[44:35] predestination to you
[44:38] the fact that only the redeemed have
[44:39] angels proves predestination to you and
[44:42] these little ones of the kingdom are
[44:44] their angel always beholds the father's
[44:46] face so there's a receiver inside of the
[44:49] believer a sieging of god amen in the
[44:51] soul to receive revelation amen and when
[44:54] you received the revelation that this
[44:56] was eagle's food and left the others you
[44:58] heard from your theophany so there's a
[45:00] representation of you somewhere that can
[45:02] see the father's face
[45:05] which means with that representation
[45:08] there is nothing hidden amen there's
[45:10] nothing obscure there's nothing hidden
[45:13] that representation can see the father's
[45:15] face
[45:16] and if the father's faith is unveiled to
[45:18] that angel amen praise be to god brother
[45:21] branham said now he says and angels are
[45:24] messengers
[45:26] what message are they carrying and to
[45:28] who amen
[45:30] because the angels are messengers amen
[45:32] are you receiving any messages amen is
[45:35] there any revelation coming on this
[45:36] revealed word in the end time praise be
[45:39] to god amen we have representation in
[45:42] heaven
[45:42] [Music]
[45:43] and i'm so glad there's a mystical
[45:45] channel somewhere
[45:47] that something can come rolling down
[45:49] from the unseen world and landing here
[45:52] just like the woman at the well amen she
[45:54] didn't
[45:55] she didn't have to go to school she
[45:57] didn't have to do any experimentation
[45:59] amen she's standing there talking to the
[46:01] man began to receive something was
[46:03] moving inside of her at this visitation
[46:06] and she began to receive the word and
[46:08] brother branham said because she had
[46:10] representation in heaven
[46:11] [Music]
[46:12] and i just say thanks be to god that
[46:15] there's ears somewhere that can hear
[46:17] amen
[46:18] there's eyes somewhere that can see amen
[46:20] i need more than these ears and i need
[46:22] more than these eyes i need something a
[46:24] little deeper because many people have
[46:26] heard many people have seen and still
[46:28] not believed but oh god thank god for
[46:32] eyes and ears that can hear and see
[46:37] amen
[46:39] brother branham goes on to say in things
[46:40] that are to be i'm just going to touch
[46:42] on this and then keep moving he says now
[46:44] in things that
[46:46] things that are to be now
[46:48] remember these are only temporal gifts
[46:50] in time now we know that moses in
[46:53] building the tabernacle in the
[46:54] wilderness or preparing it he said he
[46:56] made all things after the order of what
[46:58] he saw in heaven
[46:59] so the earthly things only express what
[47:01] the eternal things are and of this earth
[47:04] that we live in today being so great as
[47:06] we love it and love to live and breathe
[47:08] the air and see the flowers and things
[47:10] if that
[47:12] if this here is the expression one
[47:14] that's dying is only expressing one
[47:17] that's eternal
[47:18] when you see a tree struggling pooling
[47:20] trying to live that means there's a tree
[47:22] somewhere that doesn't have to do that
[47:25] when you see a man here struggling to
[47:27] live somebody in a hospital or a sick
[47:29] bed or an accident struggling and the
[47:31] death rattles in their throat and
[47:32] pulling and crying and screaming for
[47:34] life what does that mean there's a place
[47:37] somewhere there's a body that doesn't
[47:38] struggle and scream for that see it just
[47:42] doesn't do it
[47:43] now they are temporal gifts to us these
[47:46] things only expressing that there is one
[47:49] where it's where it's the eternal one
[47:51] that's what jesus has gone away to
[47:53] prepare the eternal one for us now they
[47:56] only express there's a there's a greater
[47:59] of some kind because these are the same
[48:01] kind now remember the bible said if this
[48:04] earthly tabernacle of our dwelling if it
[48:06] perished be dissolved we have one
[48:09] already waiting
[48:12] do you have a body waiting do you ever
[48:14] thought theophany have you heard from
[48:15] your theophany do you have
[48:17] representation in heaven that
[48:18] representation in heaven is not blind
[48:22] that representation listen this body has
[48:25] senses
[48:26] is that right
[48:28] this body has senses it can see amen it
[48:31] can taste it can hear amen but the
[48:33] theophany has senses too amen and the
[48:35] theophany can see and the theophany can
[48:38] hear
[48:39] i'm so glad that there's a theophany
[48:42] that can see in here there and has some
[48:44] way to communicate with me down here to
[48:47] communicate to me down here what it can
[48:49] see up there
[48:51] because we're limited down here but if
[48:53] we have representation in heaven that
[48:55] can see amen that can see the father's
[48:58] face that can see openly that can hear
[49:01] the truth that can see the reality amen
[49:04] and and it has some way for me to hear
[49:07] from my theophany then i say praise be
[49:09] to god amen i can hear from something
[49:12] that's there
[49:14] something that can see and something
[49:17] that can hear amen i'm not reliant just
[49:20] upon the the this dimension and i'm not
[49:22] relying just upon these physical
[49:25] attributes that i have in a physical
[49:27] body or in a an earthly spirit realm
[49:30] there's some other part of me amen that
[49:33] can access something somewhere i don't
[49:35] understand it and i don't understand how
[49:37] it works but i've been the recipient of
[49:39] it friends
[49:42] i've been the recipient of that great
[49:44] channel how does it work i don't know
[49:46] how to describe it i don't know maybe
[49:48] i'm describing it all wrong now i don't
[49:50] know but all i know amen is that i've
[49:53] heard from my theophany
[49:55] i know for sure amen that there must be
[49:58] representation in heaven and something
[50:00] in the soul that can connect
[50:04] and can bring us to revelation
[50:06] of all things
[50:10] because what revelation does it bring
[50:12] it brings the revelation of who you
[50:14] really are
[50:17] who your father really is
[50:21] it brings you the revelation of the word
[50:24] is that right
[50:27] and it and it gives you your purpose in
[50:29] this life
[50:32] the revelation of the word does all
[50:34] those things
[50:37] and i'd like to say like i said before
[50:39] what else do we need
[50:42] when i start thinking about this subject
[50:44] and start thinking about
[50:46] i had to bypass the theophany to come to
[50:49] be tempted in a realm of unbelief
[50:52] and then to take our stand upon the word
[50:54] and
[50:55] but god
[50:56] he knew how to bring revelation to each
[51:00] one of us
[51:01] and he and he brought a word amen a
[51:03] perfect word in this day
[51:05] and he unveiled the mystery amen that
[51:08] was in the back part of his mind from
[51:10] before the foundation of the world at
[51:11] the opening of the seals he opened the
[51:13] word and brother branham said my bible
[51:15] became a new book to me amen and the
[51:17] seals have been taken off the word of
[51:19] god amen the heavenly realm has been
[51:22] opened up and there's been a call to
[51:23] come up higher amen to see these things
[51:26] and i say what else do we want and what
[51:29] else do we want to focus on and what
[51:30] else do we want to look at and what else
[51:32] do we need to overcome
[51:34] and i begin to realize i begin to i
[51:36] begin to meditate on these things and
[51:38] and i began to say i don't need to know
[51:41] what's happening in all of the world
[51:44] i don't need all the information i don't
[51:46] need to know i don't need to know
[51:49] every bomb that's dropped in ukraine and
[51:51] what city it's hit and how many peop i
[51:53] don't need to know that everything i
[51:55] know has been given to me in the message
[51:58] everything i know is this word of god
[51:59] that's been unveiled i don't need to
[52:01] seek other information i don't need to
[52:03] seek after other things amen the thing i
[52:05] need to pursue after with all of my
[52:07] heart is this message that's been given
[52:09] to us this word that's been unveiled
[52:11] because every obstacle i'll find is
[52:13] explained by the word everything that's
[52:15] going on in the world is explained by
[52:17] the word amen the devil is constantly
[52:19] trying to bring distractions to give us
[52:21] information but that information is not
[52:23] all things
[52:25] the facts and the details and the
[52:27] information is not all things and cannot
[52:29] add to all things all of that is cannon
[52:32] fodder the all things is the word the
[52:34] word is all things the word is
[52:36] everything the word is my life
[52:40] so i don't need
[52:42] i don't need
[52:44] the
[52:44] news to figure out my life
[52:53] in fact
[52:55] i don't need
[52:56] so many things that i felt that i needed
[52:59] in life i don't need
[53:02] and so many things i thought i needed to
[53:04] know to be successful in life i don't
[53:07] need to know
[53:09] so many things i wanted i've wanted to
[53:11] learn
[53:13] you know one of my problems is i love to
[53:15] research i love it
[53:17] i love to read i love the research i
[53:18] love to look things up
[53:20] but none of that is helping me
[53:23] with my purpose in this life
[53:26] none of that is moving me in the program
[53:29] of god none of that is what i need amen
[53:32] what i need is this word this word is
[53:34] all things to me this word is all things
[53:40] jesus could know all things
[53:42] and he could learn
[53:44] he could know all things and increase in
[53:46] wisdom he could know all things and say
[53:48] only the father knows when the son of
[53:50] man will come
[53:52] but he still knew all things
[53:54] and we could somebody could ask you a
[53:57] question about you know what's going to
[53:59] happen in this situation what do you
[54:01] think will happen with with this set of
[54:03] circumstances in the world and you can
[54:05] say i don't know
[54:08] but you can still know all things
[54:12] because you know the real things and if
[54:15] you know the real things you know all
[54:18] things
[54:20] amen
[54:21] you know i i i talked a couple weeks ago
[54:23] about you know the the the the way the
[54:26] lord's been dealing with me on my phone
[54:27] and the time on my phone and i realized
[54:30] there's facts there's information
[54:32] there's details there there's story
[54:34] lines and then there's there's
[54:36] everybody's opinion attached to it
[54:39] there's a story about what's going on in
[54:42] the economy everybody's got an opinion
[54:44] there's a story about what's going on
[54:45] with war everybody's got an opinion
[54:47] there's a story with all this and all
[54:49] these opinions and i say it's all every
[54:52] bit cannon fodder amen it all passed
[54:55] away it's all the wisdom of man it's all
[54:57] nonsense and it is not what i need amen
[55:00] none of it has come down that mystical
[55:02] channel and hit me amen it's all come
[55:05] through a digital channel and the
[55:07] digital channel is bringing lies but the
[55:09] mystical channel brings the truth
[55:14] and i want to be tapped into the
[55:15] mystical channel amen i want to receive
[55:18] information not from all these sources
[55:21] there's one source i want to receive and
[55:23] i want to receive the one that can bring
[55:25] revelation on the word because that's
[55:27] all things to me
[55:30] if we overcome will overcome by the word
[55:34] if we have victory it'll be victory by
[55:35] the word
[55:37] if god amen if god ever delivers us
[55:40] it'll be by the word if we ever get over
[55:43] anything it'll be by the word
[55:46] and brother brethren he comes down to
[55:47] the end of his ministry and he begins to
[55:49] talk and he begins to say the
[55:51] stabilizers have been put on the ship
[55:55] what i didn't see the stabilizers
[55:59] what did they look like what shape and
[56:00] what ship
[56:02] he's speaking spiritually
[56:05] the stabilizers have been put on the
[56:07] ship
[56:08] what what came through his ministry it
[56:11] was the word
[56:14] and when the word was revealed the
[56:15] stabilizers came on the ship
[56:18] and said she'll crest every wave
[56:23] you see a wave coming
[56:25] don't worry stabilizers are on the ship
[56:28] you see trouble brewing
[56:29] don't worry stabilizers are put on the
[56:32] ship
[56:33] the problem is when we hit uncertain
[56:35] times in times of uncertainty especially
[56:38] if we've never gone down this road
[56:40] before what we try to do is get as much
[56:42] information about it as we can
[56:44] amen and we've already been given all
[56:46] the information that we need
[56:49] if i believe if we would spend as much
[56:51] time searching the message as we spend
[56:54] searching other sources then god would
[56:56] give us the answers to all of our
[56:58] problems
[56:59] if we spent as much time searching the
[57:01] scriptures and searching the message as
[57:04] we do searching for answers out on the
[57:06] net and asking friends and finding
[57:08] experts amen that's fine amen everything
[57:11] is fine amen but there's one expert i
[57:13] need and that's expert king jesus amen
[57:16] who's brought the word in this day and
[57:18] that's the expert advice that i'm
[57:20] looking for
[57:22] i
[57:23] this is just me but i want to get more
[57:25] advice on my knees than i do in
[57:27] somebody's office
[57:28] [Music]
[57:30] i think god is has got to hone us down
[57:34] amen and get us focused again
[57:37] there's too much information amen and we
[57:40] think the world's gone into chaos and it
[57:43] probably is going to continue to get
[57:45] more chaotic and can get you to get it
[57:47] all kinds of worse amen and nothing
[57:50] listen i
[57:51] i
[57:52] i am so far removed from wanting to hear
[57:56] one conspiracy theory
[58:02] there's
[58:03] you know i'm patient with a lot of
[58:05] things but i am not patient with that
[58:09] everybody's listening to somebody who
[58:11] they know knows that has the answer
[58:15] uh they're listening to somebody some 40
[58:18] year old man in his mother's basement
[58:20] who can't even hold down a job and he's
[58:21] going to explain to you how the world
[58:23] works and
[58:24] what's going on
[58:25] i mean you don't know these people you
[58:27] don't know their credentials and you
[58:29] don't know what they know and they don't
[58:31] know
[58:34] but i know in whom i have believed
[58:37] and i know that the word that he's given
[58:38] us is pure and i know it's unadulterated
[58:41] and i know it's perfect and i know that
[58:43] it'll never fail and i know that this
[58:45] ship has the stabilizers and it'll crest
[58:47] every storm what else do i need to know
[58:49] but this amen
[58:51] i say god help me my desire more than
[58:53] ever is to be centrally focused on the
[58:56] word and the greatest portion of my
[58:58] spiritual diet coming from this word and
[59:01] my time from the word and fellowship
[59:03] around the world and enough with the
[59:05] world i'm done with the world i'm
[59:07] preparing to leave the world i don't
[59:08] want to spend any more time with the
[59:10] world i don't need the world's
[59:12] information i don't need the world's
[59:13] answers all my answers have been given
[59:16] to me in this revealed word
[59:19] everything we need everything we need
[59:20] for our families everything we need for
[59:22] our finances everything we need has been
[59:24] revealed to us in this word
[59:28] amen
[59:30] i think we'd be amazed at what we find
[59:32] laying in this message and in this bible
[59:34] amen to answer our questions if we would
[59:36] just spend time there
[59:40] what do i do about this family situation
[59:42] how about consulting the word
[59:46] i don't know where to look well just
[59:48] keep reading
[59:50] where do i turn what message do i listen
[59:52] to i don't know i can't tell you just
[59:54] read them all
[59:56] and eventually you'll hit the answer
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:04] that little woman at the well
[1:00:08] she had to come in contact with the word
[1:00:11] for something to unlock inside of her
[1:00:14] and it was the revealed word that
[1:00:16] unlocked her identity and broke her
[1:00:18] spiritual amnesia
[1:00:20] and she began to realize
[1:00:22] that i'm not the son of charles and elle
[1:00:24] branham
[1:00:26] i'm not the harlot i'm not the
[1:00:28] prostitute i'm not the immoral woman
[1:00:31] of samaria i'm a daughter of god
[1:00:34] can you imagine the joy in that woman
[1:00:36] when she realized i'm not the immoral
[1:00:39] prostitute of samaria i'm a daughter of
[1:00:41] almighty god
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:45] no wonder she dropped her old water pot
[1:00:47] went running back into the city
[1:00:51] let's look at together at second peter
[1:00:53] chapter one
[1:00:58] i want to look at just a couple more
[1:01:00] scriptures
[1:01:05] when i look at what has been given to us
[1:01:09] and the potential that lays in this word
[1:01:12] i begin to get excited
[1:01:15] and when i see the world getting into a
[1:01:17] greater chaos i get more excited because
[1:01:20] the potential is in the word that's been
[1:01:21] given to us
[1:01:23] let's look at
[1:01:25] ii peter chapter 1 verse 2.
[1:01:30] ii peter
[1:01:32] chapter 1 verse 2
[1:01:34] grace and peace be multiplied into you
[1:01:36] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:01:38] jesus our lord according as his divine
[1:01:40] power has given unto us all things that
[1:01:43] pertain unto life and godliness
[1:01:46] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:01:49] called us to glory and virtue
[1:01:52] so look at that again
[1:01:54] his divine power verse 3 according as
[1:01:56] his divine power has given unto us all
[1:01:59] things
[1:02:01] all things
[1:02:03] that pertain unto life
[1:02:05] and godliness
[1:02:06] this life is a zoe life
[1:02:10] so we've been given all things all
[1:02:12] things that pertain to eternal life and
[1:02:15] godliness
[1:02:17] what has been given to us all things all
[1:02:20] things that pertain
[1:02:22] to life
[1:02:23] and godliness
[1:02:26] what else do we want
[1:02:29] these are the old things he's given what
[1:02:30] else are we looking for
[1:02:33] i think
[1:02:34] we found what we've been looking for
[1:02:37] i think we've found the source of all
[1:02:39] things i think we've received all things
[1:02:42] and i think we need to let all things
[1:02:45] become
[1:02:46] everything
[1:02:48] amen let's look at first john chapter 2.
[1:02:53] just go over just a little bit
[1:02:56] first john chapter 2.
[1:03:03] and let's read verse 18.
[1:03:07] little children it is the last time and
[1:03:09] as you have heard that antichrist shall
[1:03:11] come even now are there many antichrist
[1:03:15] whereby we know that it is the last time
[1:03:19] they went out from us because they were
[1:03:21] not of us for they had for if they had
[1:03:23] been of us they would no doubt have
[1:03:25] continued with us
[1:03:27] but they went out that they might be
[1:03:29] made manifest that they were not all of
[1:03:31] us
[1:03:33] but you have an unction
[1:03:35] from the holy one that word unction
[1:03:37] means anointing
[1:03:40] you have an unction you have an
[1:03:41] anointing from the holy one
[1:03:43] and you know
[1:03:45] all
[1:03:46] things
[1:03:47] when when jesus comes to the samaritan
[1:03:50] woman and said messiah will tell us all
[1:03:52] things
[1:03:53] the messiah didn't tell them
[1:03:55] everything they couldn't answer every
[1:03:57] question about every silly question
[1:03:59] somebody would ask them they would have
[1:04:01] to say i don't know but i thought you
[1:04:03] said the messiah will tell you all
[1:04:04] things but he didn't tell me that
[1:04:07] but here you have an unction of the holy
[1:04:10] ghost you have an unction let me read
[1:04:12] that again
[1:04:13] but you have an unction anointing from
[1:04:15] the holy one and you know
[1:04:17] all things
[1:04:19] the question is the people that john
[1:04:21] were writing to did they know everything
[1:04:23] about everything
[1:04:25] did they know every detail about
[1:04:27] everything in life no but he says you
[1:04:30] have an unction of the holy one and you
[1:04:31] know all things
[1:04:33] what are the old things he's talking
[1:04:35] about he's talking about the all things
[1:04:36] that i want and the only things that i
[1:04:39] want are the all things that john's
[1:04:41] talking about
[1:04:42] under this anointing of the holy one we
[1:04:45] have all things
[1:04:48] amen brother branham goes on to say in
[1:04:49] the god who is rich in mercy
[1:04:52] he says now we are a part of god
[1:04:55] you always was you don't remember it
[1:04:57] because you were only an attributed god
[1:04:59] you were only in his thinking your very
[1:05:02] name if it ever was on the book of life
[1:05:04] it was put there before the foundation
[1:05:05] of the world he knew what you were
[1:05:09] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:05:10] doctrine but to straighten it out that
[1:05:12] we might get away from this fear and
[1:05:14] scare you don't know who you are you're
[1:05:17] not going to be but now are you the sons
[1:05:19] of god and you always were the sons of
[1:05:22] god see for when god had you in his
[1:05:24] thinking at the beginning you have to be
[1:05:27] some part of you your life that's in you
[1:05:29] now had to be with god before the before
[1:05:32] their well when when he before he even
[1:05:34] became material here on earth before
[1:05:37] there was anything but god you were one
[1:05:39] of his attributes he knowed what your
[1:05:42] name would be he know the color of hair
[1:05:44] you would have he knowed all about you
[1:05:48] you know what else he knowed he know he
[1:05:50] knew what day and age you would be
[1:05:51] manifest in
[1:05:54] he knew that you would live in lima or
[1:05:57] near lima you don't all live in lima
[1:05:59] some of you are lucky enough to still be
[1:06:01] outside of lion
[1:06:04] but he knew where you would live and he
[1:06:06] knew you would live here in 2022
[1:06:09] and he knew the world conditions
[1:06:11] and he knew the stresses and he knew and
[1:06:14] he knew the pressures and he knew the
[1:06:16] chaos that would break out and he knows
[1:06:18] the chaos that will break out he knew
[1:06:20] all of that amen so he he gave you all
[1:06:24] things that you would need in this day
[1:06:28] and how did he give it to us through the
[1:06:30] message of the hour
[1:06:33] and i say
[1:06:34] thank you lord jesus
[1:06:36] for giving me all things
[1:06:39] for we have an unction an anointing of

[1:06:44] all things so tomorrow when you go to
[1:06:47] work tell them you know everything

[1:06:54] know all things
[1:06:55] i don't know everything but i know all
[1:06:57] things
[1:06:59] because heaven consists of the word
[1:07:02] and i am part of the word
[1:07:05] and i've received the full revelation of
[1:07:07] the word so heaven is open to me
[1:07:11] amen

[1:07:49] squirrels
[1:07:54] this revelation of the word has been
[1:07:56] capable of providing when there was no
[1:07:58] provision
[1:08:00] this revelation of the word has been
[1:08:02] able to answer the questions of the
[1:08:04] critics in the face of the critics this

[1:08:08] able to overcome this revelation this
[1:08:10] word has been demonstrated amen in a
[1:08:12] vessel of clay that demonstrated this
[1:08:14] revelation of the world and it was all
[1:08:17] things and everything and all things
[1:08:18] that we need to overcome in this day
[1:08:21] it's been given to us
[1:08:23] i don't think we could treasure it
[1:08:24] enough i don't think we could put enough
[1:08:26] value on it i don't think we could spend
[1:08:28] enough time with it
