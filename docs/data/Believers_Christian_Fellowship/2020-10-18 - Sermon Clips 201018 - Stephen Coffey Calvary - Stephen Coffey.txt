and you know i stood at golgotha's hill and i've looked at it and i've been there i've been at the tomb and you know i i never experienced any power there i i felt let down i'll be completely honest with you i i was there and i was expecting this you know great feeling and i felt nothing i was recently i was on a work trip and i was in louisville and i went by brother branham's grave and i was standing there and i was thinking this is brother brandon's grave i had never been there just until recently and uh i was standing there and i was looking at it i was thinking man this is brother brandon's grave and i felt nothing i went to the place where the angel uh came down in the in the in the place and i matched it up with the photo and was standing right there and i was thinking this is awesome but i felt very little and you know what came to me is a realization that oh it's not there anymore it's in me i realized oh that's that's that's why this is an amazing place it's sacred to god it's an amazing place it's an amazing piece of geography on the face of the earth but god is not there anymore he's in me and i realize that that the power that was there has transformed itself into me why i don't know i still ask the question why but it is and i believe it is and my faith makes it so and i'm there by the revelation of jesus christ as the spirit of wisdom and of revelation works in the knowledge that we have of him he brings you into an awareness that you are the godhead bodily may the cross have its full effect in us today i i pray that it would may that may i pray that it would move you today i pray that as just in thinking of it just in bringing it up that it would remind you of who you are because of of calvary's cross sin was finished because of calvary's cross those who accept it your victory over death was one because of calvary's cross your healing was signed sealed and delivered your healing was signed sealed and delivered because of the cross your anxiety your depression your mental struggle your issues was won and finished because of calvary's cross because of calvary's cross you as the elect of god you see your redemption story clearly unfolding before you and your eternal future of godliness and peace and joy was purchased for you because of calvary's cross
