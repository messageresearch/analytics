just bow your heads with the word prayer heavenly father how we do love you lord it's a honor and a real privilege lord that by your grace lord you called us and brought us together lord we look back through our lives and we realize there's nothing been good we've never preserved ourselves we never had any great ability we weren't even really looking for you you came our way one day and you called us lord you chose us like you chose your disciples lord we find ourselves to be the greatest most privileged people on this earth father and lord it's our hearts desire to express to you the same type of love that you expressed to us father so lord god i just pray lord that you would come down lord and open our eyes and break the word like you did in times gone past do something in such a way that you did it before father so we know that you are here because we believe that you are here your promise said you are here but lord you're so good to us you remind us all the time through the little things you do that we recognize and see you in our midst so father we love you from the bottom of our heart we don't just say it from an intellectual mind with the right words we love you lord pray lord your blessings upon this evening may all things be said and done for your glory in jesus name amen amen i sure do appreciate the atmosphere i am always nice when he's here before i even get out here and i know he is and just want to uh tell you all i love you really really do i had a really nice day today it's beautiful and i i you couldn't have any better days than the day i had i just taken me by inspiration from one thing to the next just in his presence just walking with him and i find that's the greatest joy of my life always has been always will be the greatest joy of my life just let me walk with him i don't need anything i think brother branham tells the story of a black man he became a preacher and he was crossing over and he fell asleep and he said hey we went over there and someone was talking to him about a crown he said i don't talk to me about no crown just let me look at him for a thousand years and that's always been the greatest desire of a real believer is just seeing jesus just being with him and knowing you're with him and knowing he's with you it's an amazing amazing so i had a great great day and i just enjoyed it and i just want to come pour out and pour out what's been poured in over the last little while so if you will we'll just go right to the word jeremiah 29 jeremiah 29 verse 10. jeremiah 29 verse 10 for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not evil to give you an expected end i like that he's already set it in motion he's bringing me somewhere he's had a vision and i'm in his vision i'm in his place and i'm just walking out a predetermined role that he already set for me and ye shall seek me then ye shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place where i caused you to be carried away captive one other portion of scripture i'd like you to turn to the song of solomon chapter 3. song of solomon chapter three verse one song of solomon chapter 3 verse 1 by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not the watchmen that go about the city found me found me to him to whom i say saw ye him whom my soul loveth it was but a little that i passed from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that conceived me may god add his blessings to the word you may be seated this may seem like strange portions of scripture but i have a thought that's been stirring in me and and i and i want to express it not so much in um human intellectual abilities but just my heart and i i i want to bring out this searching for god and my title tonight is in pursuit of my beloved and i you see here in jeremiah when you seek me with all of your heart you shall find me and the scripture here in solomon it's it's very clearly song of solomon is a strange book for me but it's an expression of a love story and it's extremely intimate and it's an expression of her heart's desire to find him even when she can't find him and i find that interesting because this happens multiple times in the book of solomon that her beloved hides himself you know he approaches he comes near and he hides he disappears and you start to wonder why you ever have those concepts you ever have those times in your life where it feels like god's withdrawn from me god has seemingly job said it looks like he's moved to my left hand i can't find him do you remember brother bannon talked about job he said he was a prophet and having that gift of prophet he could go up into those spiritual realms and he could get answers from god i believe it's a lot like brother branham when he said you know if i ever really wanted to know something i could get an answer he had a gift he had a prophetic gift if he wanted to see something in somebody he could get it if he wanted to know something about god he could go back and look at the story he could see the baptism of jesus and john he had the ability with a prophetic gift to go out and reach out and find the answers from god and in job he starts to talk about this this ability but job found him to be in hiding he found him to not be able to grab him and get a hold of him he had went to the left hand and it's interesting he says the left hand because the right hand is to whom the arm of the lord is revealed god is revealing himself with his right hand but in the left hand god job found god to be in hiding and the question then becomes why does god do that why does it look like sometimes he's so present and then sometimes he's so far i think it has a lot to do with the pursuit that he wants in you i um when i was in florida this question came my wife asked me a question she says kyle what do you deem as a treasure what's a treasure to you and i didn't answer her right away and she got upset at me but i was contemplating i was thinking about the answer i didn't want to just give a quick answer i wanted to think about it because to identify a treasure price is always determined by or yeah value is always determined by price paid if i say that is not worth a hundred thousand dollars but to you you're willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for it guess what its value is the price you were willing to pay for it and this price that one is willing to pay determines its value to you as the individual not to everybody else and this question started coming in my mind and i started thinking it just going through my mind as a treasure i says you know if it's a treasure i'm willing to sacrifice a lot for it and when we think of a great treasure you would say now i know that jesus christ must value me because he paid a great price for me and that is never in question because you know the great price he paid for you but then the question becomes of what great price and a value is he to you you know because only what you're willing to pay to get him will determine his value to you your brother branham said if i had 100 million dollars here or i had the opportunity to push a button and i could have 10 more minutes i think with my dad he said it wouldn't even be a question i'd pay the price and the truth of the matter is so many people just don't want to pay a price for him they don't they want somebody else to pay the price for them they want somebody else to do all their spiritual work for them they're looking to someone so they can stay spiritually lazy and not have to make an effort but i'm asking a question what type of bride is that what type of if i came home and my wife she served me she did things she took care of things but she never expressed the love for me you know the highlight of my day my absolute highlight of my day in this natural life when i come home is when i open the door and i hear daddy it's my highlight it's my highlight of my day no matter how bad the day was when i come home and i hear there's an expectation of my arrival man that gets me i see my little girl and my big girl i'm not gonna say my bigger girl older girl my wife when they're excited to see me it does something to me it does something to me and it's always the highlight it's always the place where i'm like oh man they do love me they're excited when i come around they're in anticipation of my arrival and we see in the song of solomon's that this beloved bride is an expectation she's anxiously awaiting him she's in constant pursuit of him she's not going to let anything stop her in getting to her beloved she's not going to let life circumstances she's not going to let disappointments she's not going to let difficulties she's not going to let anything stop her in her pursuit for him and i began to realize that over the last couple months now here's where i get personal because i want to be something that is difficult that's honest i don't want to be anything other than honest what is the point i don't want to be no pharisee no sadducee i want to be honest and i noticed something in my own life i noticed that my pursuit and my passion in my pursuit of the person jesus christ had cooled off it had cooled off and you know what snuck in that took over service now this will sound like a paradox but it's actually scriptural your service to him can sometimes get in the way of your love expressed to him i'll put it this way martha martha when jesus said martha martha mary chose the better thing he didn't say what she was doing was bad it wasn't wrong but there was a better thing martha there was a better thing at that moment the better thing at that moment was you to sit down sit down at my feet hear the word and believe the word you're so busy martha and he appreciated it no doubt he did but he was she was so busy entertaining him but she wasn't concerned enough to find out what was his desire she thought maybe he just wanted entertained wanted taken care of here's some more drinks here's some more this and here's that but she wasn't mindful of his desire his desire was sit down hear the word be quiet stop moving around so much stop going here and going there and i i i had this thought mainly because you know in covid 2020 there's not much missions work going on around the world like really honestly almost nothing seemed like the world stopped i think it needed to i think the i think life and the pace of life and our activities and all the things we were doing needed to stop so you could actually find out what is his desire there's no more searching lord what do you want there's no more asking there's go to church hear a wonderful sermon put some more pieces of the puzzle together but where's your pursuit of him now i'm not taking away from the ministry remember i'm just talking from my heart because god is clearly here and he's clearly putting the pieces of the puzzle together and in the same time he's revealing me to me and in the same time he's revealing his heart's desire to me amen because i don't want to i needed i wanted to return back to my first love i had to go back and brother branham says if you ever lose him along life's path you got to go right back where you left him nothing sinful just my passion my pursuit had cooled and i found i was hiding behind service i loved being a deacon i loved being youth loved traveling the word loved doing all that i could do but i was so busy i wasn't taking the time to have him whisper those love secrets to me directly and personally and you know we are all subject to it i'm not the only one i'm just the one being honest about it and what honestly honestly what is the point for an individual you know god didn't choose angels to preach the gospel he chose men men that make mistakes men that god can work with god can mold and he can shape and he can break he didn't choose angels he chose men that are weak frail subject to utter brokenness and i think that's what he wanted i'm actually convinced he is more interested in you being his greatest desire and in the pursuit you know i'm so convinced he creates the circumstances to create a desperation to have you to run after him again he does it like that he's done that like that for me many times so many times and so i i have to tell you this testimony and brother chad shared it but ten years ago when i first came to church here we're home folk right we're just family i came to church and it was i made friends with brother jeremy in about two weeks i don't know maybe three weeks after i was coming i was sitting right there in the middle back where i'm at and i had a really rough week and it was a tuesday because i remember it was right the day before the wednesday night service and brother jeremy called me said how you doing i said brother i'm having a horrible week i'm having a bad week really bad and he he talked me through and he helped me a lot and then the minister came and he preached and when he preached i was so utterly convinced that jeremy had snuck back into the back and told him my situation because it was too perfect and i was like well maybe that's what they do i like hmm that's pretty that's pretty direct guys and i remember i asked you i said you talked to the pastor didn't you he said no i'm like no you did no i didn't i'm like i mean this wasn't a good sermon this was lip to ear god knowing what i was doing god knowing intimately involved in my situation and it actually brought fear in me i'm like this ain't like any this is a this is a church where god speaks back it's when you talk and then god speaks back he's a risen god he's a living savior he's not an i was he's the i am the presence of the i am is here it scared me it really scared me i just it oh whoa praise the lord and god's done that over the years many times but he has never done it like he did it about a month ago and uh and you know how when jesus came to jesus or peter and them he came to them in their time of discouragement they were real down peter was down the disciples were down mary was down those on the road to emmaus they're all down they were depressed they were discouraged they had seen him they had walked with him they had known he was they were in his presence but then the whole chain chain scene changed now he wasn't there they didn't know what to do so you know what they did they went back to the last place they saw him peter went back to fishing same place that god had called him mary went back to the tomb last time she saw the body put behind that stone and this time he came back and did something the exact same way he had done it before cast your net on the other side of the boat peter what road to emmaus called him in and he did something just the way he had done it before and then their eyes were open and they saw him again and i was sitting there i was in florida and i went back to talking to him really talking to him you know there's a difference between just lay me down to sleep lord i pray my soul to take you know that's this yeah and then really lord i need to talk to you i need to talk to you i got a burden and a real burden is really bothering me it's bothering me and me it's bothering me everywhere i don't know what to do with it i came home brother jeremy and i have a conversation and i spilled my heart i mean i just gushed and just told him my concern and my concern was formalism my concern was religious tradition in me my concern was seeing myself being comfortable with my human ability and it was scaring me and then it was scaring me for people because i either i love the lord i really do i really love the lord and he knows that and i'm talking to him and uh and in the conversation we talk about the fig belief of religion and so many people are hiding behind it and then i get up that was saturday i had a youth meeting on sunday and i began with the kids and i i had talked i titled it seeing jesus again recognizing the presence of the i am and the whole thing was me and the kids could tell you the whole thing was me just absolutely almost in tears crying out saying if you value him what price will you pay for your relationship with him because your relationship to him is not determined by your proximity to the right church or your proximity to the right pastor or even knowing that you're in the right home that is not determining your relationship with god you actually have to be in pursuit and you actually have to value his relationship you notice that you can hide behind doctrine you can hide behind creeds and the correct religious statements you really can you can put that fig leaf on and i was talking to kids about this you can hide behind all those things and you know what it means to god nothing it means nothing in fact he says i will turn my eyes from your solemn feast and from your lifting up of hands it's isaiah 1. once you turn to it isaiah 1. isaiah 1 11 says to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of burnt offerings of rams and of the fat of fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of the he goats when he come to appear before me he hath required this at your hand to tread my courts bring me no more vain oblations and incenses and it is an abomination unto me the new moons and the sabbaths and the calling of assemblings i cannot away with it it is iniquity even the solemn assemblies your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide my eyes from you yea when you make any prayers or many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood wash you make you clean and put away the evil doings from mine eyes and cease to do evil here's a people that's serving god and it's absolutely utterly in vain utterly in vain doing all the right things in vain it means nothing to him do you remember the story brother branham talks about that married couple i think it's paul rayder and paul rader said he had a situation wife they had a couple words and he walked out the door and he kissed her and left it came back he was walking down the street and he says you know what he says what if that's the last time i'm ever with my wife last time i get to kiss her he said oh it got to him he turned it back he walked back he found his wife sitting behind the door crying and he grabbed her picked her up kissed her again he walked away looked back and his wife was sitting there smiling he said what was the difference it was all the same act he said just one of them had meaning behind it one of them had meaning and that's what i'm thinking that this is getting to here with song of solomon and this beloved you're doing all the right things but why why do you do them why do you serve god why do you come here for what purpose and for what reason is it to express your love for him so i asked the kids i said i hope you're not just coming to youth meetings because your mom and dad's going to get mad at you i hope you don't just come to church because well what if they say something where are they at you know my goodness what would be the point in lifting up hands like that god knows your purpose in being here god knows you're not here because you love him you're probably just too afraid of standing the reproach of not being here maybe the family rejection things of that nature well that's a sad situation that's a bad motivator that's a horrible situation to find yourself in it means you've left your first love you've lost your reason you've lost your vision you lost your passion for christ that's the one thing i don't ever want and if i get that feeling i get desperate that's where i have to get and that's where we all have to get is we have to get desperate again we don't want to come to church and feel a false comfort because it's a false comfort just to be a part of the right church that's a wonderful thing but remember the whole desire and purpose of the ministry was to point you to christ not to draw themselves to draw you unto themselves and that i find this to be the most dangerous position is those that have proximity by gifts to the presence of god find themselves to be in the most dangerous of all positions because they can take the same thing with the gift and bring glory into themselves as opposed to the thing they're supposed to be doing and it's becoming the lowest among all as a servant to all and point them to christ and that became my biggest burden my biggest concern is i'm looking at the whole realm of things and i'm saying is this really what god wanted does he really want big conventions does he really want all the solemn feasts does he really want all the beauty because every time i look at him through the bible he's bruised he's wounded he's he's no beauty we should behold him he said it's not the beauty of physical characteristics it's a beauty of an inward character and he says you look with your eyes which you see with your heart and you notice here when song of solomon's beloved when she looks at him she says oh my beloved he's ruddy do you know what ruddy means not big and handsome but if you look at has she continues to describe him oh he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul so i wonder what she saw when she looked at him i don't think it was the beauty of of a big form i think it was the attractiveness of character i think she was attracted to that character with everything in me i believe with all my heart that the bride is attracted to him in all of it she'll go through all of it to get to him and nothing will stop that pursuit even when they try and we'll get to that because in song of solomon there is literally that situation that happens in mark 8 it says and when he had called for the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me and this is interesting because you realize there always always a price to be paid to walk with him there's no there's no walking with him unless there's a cross for you to take up there's like a there has to be sacrifice right a treasure is something of value and what determines value is a price worth pain and if you pay no price for it what does it mean to you if you don't care about your closeness and proximity to the presence of god in your life everyday life not sunday and wednesday then you're not going to pay much of a price for it it's not precious to you if i give you a piece of gold are you just going to throw it in the front seat of your car and not lock your doors and park it outside no you would be afraid that anybody would tamper with this because it's a treasure to you but we also let we were so flippantly with our own personal life with our own consecration to god to our own proximity to hearing the whisper of his voice we treat that as if it's nothing we treat it as if who cares i want the pastor to do all the spiritual work for me i don't want to have to pay a price daily you mean i have to take up my cross daily you mean i need to do something i i seek you early in the morning like he's worth that he's worth it he's worth thinking about constantly he's worth being in his word not for the sake of being able to debate not for the sake of being able to show yourself to be something but you're in his word so you can know him you're in his word because you love him and you want to be in his presence see you can do all the right things for all the wrong reasons you can come to church it's the right thing to do and it could be the wrong thing you see i think god is looking for motive and objective in the bride of his desire he desires a certain kind of a bride he really does but he won't force you you make your own choice you have to make your own choice in hebrews it says by faith enoch was translated that she not he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of who them that diligently seek him i think god wants you to pursue him i think this is why god went to the left hand in job's life i think this is like the beloved hid himself from his beloved it's the pursuit it's an expression it's a price being paid and we know that this whole story is a love story this whole story comes down to a husband and wife a man and a woman and for me if i came home and my wife never showed me affection she never like she took care of the house she swept the house she made dinner but she never expressed her love to me i would have a problem with that i would know that something isn't right in my home something has been left off something all the right things are being done but it's lost all of its meaning there's no more meaning behind these things remember brother branham said he talked about sister media she's so busy he said just come here sit down sit on my lap i want to talk to you for a little bit right that's just that's just an expression of love what man doesn't want his wife to sit and talk to him just have a cup of coffee talk about the day share secrets one with the other how things are going how things are not going it's a relationship right that's what god wants he didn't save you just so that you could you know do the right things say all the right things walk around say yep that's that's what i was looking for he wants a relationship he wants a loving relationship and that's what i believe he was looking for the whole time i want you to go to song of solomon's because i find in here there's a distraction and there's something that arises that becomes a very big situation in the first portion here of song of solomon's chapters 3 it says by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i would seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw ye him whom i so loveth it was but a little that i passed from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and i would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that conceived me now this is the first pursuit of the beloved now in the second pursuit of the beloved we have a different reaction from the watchmen chapter 5 song of solomon chapter 5 verse 2 i sleep but my heart waketh it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with dew and my locks with drops of the night i have put off my coat how shall i put it on i have washed my feet how shall i defile it my beloved put in his hand by the whole of the door and my bowels were moved for him i think this is passionate i think this is really passionate this isn't cold and formal this is a love this is a real love and his very presence moving i rose up to open and my beloved and my hands dropped with mer in my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock i opened to my beloved but my beloved hath withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spoke when he spake and i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave no answer the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me what a different reaction from the watchmen the watchmen are preachers watchmen what of the night they stand guard they're there to be a protectant they're there to watch over and in this first pursuit there's no problem we'll help you in the second pursuit of the beloved to get to her beloved huh the watchmen are actually stopping this from happening the watchmen find themselves in a position as a barrier to getting to her beloved and they do something that is shocking they removed the veil now i don't know a lot about why we do the traditions we do but i believe it's the bride the husband of the gr the groom who takes the veil off of the bride what right does this watchman have to go to this position what role is he trying to play why is the watchman trying to do something that only he can do this is an interesting thing for me and then you sum this all together with this great big desire and heart concern that i have is religion over your relationship formalism cold formalism and even gifted men getting in the way of actually you connecting with christ again they're there to help you but every brother branham said i never did preach in such a way to draw people to myself he said i only pointed them to christ pointed them to christ pointed into christ and that was the goal and the objective all along the way was to connect you back to your beloved but we find in this last time it becomes an issue paul warned us of this if you turn in your bibles philippians chapters 3 now paul i find this to be so interesting paul with the great revelation that he has paul being the first church age messenger and having the mystery of christ we see that paul never loses his desire and a pursuit of and he even warns the people of what could cause their lack of pursuit philippians 3 1 finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concession beware of the men beware of those that are the great men among you for we are the circumcision which worship god in spirit and rejoice in jesus in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though i might also have confidence in flesh if any other man thinketh it he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more circumcise the eighth day the stock of israel and the tribe of benjamin and hebrew to the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and i count them but done that i might win christ and be found in him not having my known righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead now here's this not as though i already attained either were already perfect but i follow after that if i may apprehend that for which i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind i'm reaching forth into those things which are before i press toward the mark of the high calling of the prize of the pri of the high calling of god in christ jesus paul never stopped in his pursuit never did he get to a point where he says i have arrived i can let down the bar and i can relax because there's nothing more for me to do i see the plan of god and i know i'm a part in i have a part in the plan that revelation that that never the revelation of the mystery of christ never produced that in paul it never produced something inside of him where he wasn't constantly reaching out for something constantly reaching out to christ constantly pressing it's difficult it's a price to be paid it's constant now we know he paid the great price and you know what he did he put something on the inside of you that loves him so much you're willing to pay whatever price to get him it's really not him that will if they're him that runeth let me just assure you it's nothing to do with you it's something he put on the inside of you but don't let the devil come and try to cool you off with some type of religious work or some type of service or some type of system or some type of ministry that stops you from in your pursuit to him god puts something down on the side of you to set you free and it's only going to ever be set free as you connect with him the living word the present tense i am you know martha one day she got in a bad situation martha martha member service she was serving god she was entertaining god but she never was taking god at his word her his word she hadn't expressed fully her faith in god but brother branham said she redeemed herself one time death struck her home and in the very time she's calling out he goes farther away what he's hiding himself again why is he doing this all the time why does he go silent why does he go in darkness why does he go in hiding it's because he wants you to pursue him he wants an effort he wants to he shows you his great love what love will you show him what great price will you pay for him what does it mean to you it means whatever price you're willing to pay so here comes jesus now he comes and now martha's gonna put her faith into action he says oh your brother will rise oh i know in the future we know that you're a god of the future and you're a god of the the was no i am the resurrection i am the resurrection and she came in contact with the resurrection that i am and her recognition and faith that the presence of the i am is here brother brown said put the wheels of the resurrection into action and it called forth the dead and you know what does it in your life too because what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection that this is to be quick and to be made alive how by recognizing the presence of the i am is currently in my midst the presence of the i am knows where i am the presence of the i am knows where i was the presence of the i am knows what difficulty i find myself in and the presence of the i am is also recognizing or maybe even hiding seeing if i'm willing to knock and keep on knocking to seek and keep on seeking and not stopping in my pursuit of him not letting anything cool me off not letting anything stop me faith has muscles i think he said it's got some toughness to it it doesn't sit there and needs to be babied faith has something on the inside says get out of my way that is my beloved and i'm going after him is it just me or does it maybe i'm the only one that feels like i am not satisfied with cold formalism guys i'm not satisfied with church traditions i'm not satisfied with just say oh praise god we did our religious duty let's go home nonsense i was never looking for that i had that 10 15 years ago i was looking for the presence of the i am in the midst that i could talk to and he talks back i was looking for the presence of the ayah i'm in difficulty father deliver me and he comes and delivers me and all he was ever looking for was just somebody to believe to believe him someone that says i believe you lord when did the third full manifest when the little woman that probably didn't know her full abcs and couldn't say the right thing says that ain't nothing but the truth lord i believe it i believe it and when is the promise of god when does god come into reality when he actually has people on the scene that say that ain't nothing but the truth god you're the same yesterday today and forever god i have sickness but i know you're here the presence of the i am is here the resurrection is here there is nothing i have need of because he's here and if i have him i have everything there's nothing else that could ever satisfy because he's here but i think there's a pursuit i think there's some energy i think there's some passion behind that expression and and i love it i love the fact that god in his mercy can see us in whatever state we're in whatever state we find ourselves to be in he knows right where you are amen maybe even allowing it to happen maybe he's even allowing a darkness to come in just to see is he going to fight to come to me you ever notice that it's like there's a bad situation can't get out of it what do you do he could turn he could flip a switch there's a man here that can turn on the light he can flip the switch at any moment but there's something inside of you that he's looking for there's a looking away to see him i'm going to look away from everything until i find him and i'm not going to stop until i get a hold of him you know what i mean and so this is the things that i've been just chewing on and i've been so utterly shocked in my own self is here i am expressing these things to the youth and here comes god confirming himself and encouraging me at the same time encouraging me saying i'm still the god that speaks back i never changed i never left i'm still here the presence of the present tense resurrected i am still here and now i'm getting my own resurrection i'm being caught up out of the darkness that i was once in and saying he's here the presence of i am still here never changes the same yesterday today and forever that is awesome that's something you can say amen he's awesome never has changed in being an amazing god just was always looking to show his strength on behalf of his wife i've thought of this you imagine if i came home and my let's say i'm at home and my wife's sorry i'm just personal right so it's a marriage so i can find identification in these things if i came home and my wife was not thinking i was doing a very good job she's like i don't think you're doing a good job i don't think you're actually able to pay these bills i'm a little bit nervous i'm a little bit scared that you're not going to be able to come through next month so i'm going to get a job i'd be like no you're not no something inside of a man would say are you doubting my ability right what do you think god thinks when you never take your situation to him you always want to solve your own problems god did not create man to shift for himself brother branham said that he didn't make you to be that way so what is that maybe that's your human ability working through a fallen state of a fallen physical form that you're in that's trying to usurp your abilities over god's maybe you're trying to do things that god would like to show himself strong on your behalf but you won't let him you know you think of these things you get to thinking about what is the bride of his desire what kind of wife does he want choosing of a bride he's looking for a certain type of the character you know even worse if i came home and it's the middle of the night and there's somebody breaking in my wife says go hide in the closet i got this then i say woman i love you but you go to bed i die to defend my home right these are characteristics now why do i have that in me as a father and as a husband that's a characteristic of a husband he wants to show himself strong on your behalf just trust him just believing just believe that he's same yesterday today and forever he's here but put your faith into action and actually pursue him say lord that's your promise i believe you're going to fulfill your promise i'm sick lord that's your promise i know you want to show yourself strong on my behalf i believe it lord i'm going to put that the cogs of the resurrection the power of the resurrected jesus christ in my mind into action i'm sad i'm down i'm depressed but he's the prince of peace in the mighty god father that's your promise i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you and in you to the end of the world father i believe it and he'll get into action i believe he wants to get into action i know he wants to get into action because i i tasted it i tasted of that fruit and i know it's good i believe it with all my heart all i did down there in florida i got quiet and i said lord i gotta talk to you and he talked back means everything to me absolutely everything to me i wanted to play something for you but before we do that psalm 27. you know this by heart it's a rapture it's also a revelation the lord is the light of my life or my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life to whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes come up and eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in time of trouble he hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle he'll hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore i will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto him when i when hear o lord when i cry unto with my voice have mercy upon me an answer when thou saidest seek ye my face my heart said within thee thy face i will seek never stopping in its pursuit the bride never stops to seek him and she finds him that's the promise in seeking you find in knocking he answers and asking you receive because that's my husband amen that's my beloved he called me unto himself and now he's ex he's found a wife he's found a bride that needs him that really needs him desperately needs him knows no human ability no human strength no great abilities of any sort and the little i had he's doing a very good job of busting that to pieces putting me back on that potter's wheel and that's a good place to be sometimes i want to play this for you it's on my mind something brother branham had said that paints this picture quite well brother franco if you have that cued up a little bit i know it's a little different but it fits and there's a boy who worked up there with him from indianapolis about all about 100 miles above jeffersonville where i i live or live and there was um he said that my brother one day he said doc he said i i'm gonna get married if i just had enough money to pay the preacher he said i got enough money to get my license but said i haven't got enough money to pay the preacher doc said well my brother's a preacher and and he he may marry you he said he never charges people for things like that he said when you asked him if he'll marry me well that night my brother asked me i said if he's never been married before either one of them and there everything's all right he said well he i asked him and i said if it is telling come on down so when saturday come along and the boy came down it's been a great thing for me to always look back upon this i had a rainy afternoon in an old chevrolet car with the headlights wired on with a baling wire a drill up out front just a while after i'd lost my wife and i was batching two little rooms and and doc was up there with me waiting for them and and a boy got out of the car and it certainly didn't look like a groom to me or would to anybody i guess yeah i could buy a pretty good pair of shoes for a dollar and a half and he had on a pair was run over and his trousers it was real baggy and it had on one of these old mole skin jackets i don't get some of you older people would remember it looked like i could run through a washing machine without being wrenched and it was streaking tied up like this the corner up and uh a little lady got out on the side with a little oh something little checky lip dress i don't know i made a mistake on calling that kind of goods one time game ham i believe it's called and um so uh it was uh i said it wrong again and i said uh she got out of the car and they come up the steps and and when they walked in the poor little thing she i guess just about all she had on was the skirt and she didn't have no shoes harley on should hitchhike from indianapolis down had a little hair hanging down backing along kind of a flats down her back looked very young and i said to her are you old enough to get married she said yes sir and she said i have my written permission from my father and mother she said i had to show it to the court here to get my license i said all right i said i'd like to talk to you a little bit before we perform this wedding they sat down the boy kept looking around the room need the hair cut real bad and he kept looking around the room he wasn't listening to me i said son i want you to listen to what i'm saying i said yes sir and i said you love this girl he said yes sir i do i said you love him yes sir i do i said ah have you got a place to take her anthony mary said yes sir and i said all right now i said i want to ask you something i understand you're working up here on this bwa and he said yes sir that's about twelve dollars a week and i said you think you can make a living far he said i'll do all i can do and i said well that's all right and i said uh what if he gets out of what if he loses this job sister what are you going to do go run back up home to mama papa she said no sir i'm going to stay with him and i said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them you haven't got any work what are you going to do send her away said no sir i'll struggle right home we'll make it some way i felt little and i seen that he really loved her and they loved one another i married him and then i wondered where he take there a few days i asked my brother doc where it is said go down to new albany a little city blast and down on the river where i had some tin laying up where i went every day when i was as a lion so when the rest of fellows they all sit around told jokes and things i'd get in the truck and run down the river and pray during that minute and read my bible under a big piece of tin where an old iron works used to be there's a bunch of old box cars sitting down there and this fella had went down there and got one of them boxed cars and saw him a door in it and had taken a newspaper and tacky buttons how many knows what a tacky button is there's no kentuckians here it's take a piece of cardboard but a thumbtack in a little spring and then push it in the that's a tacky button so they had put it all over and he went up there to arm works and got him uh some stuff and made a step to come up and got some old boxes and had him a table and i thought one day i'll go down and see how they're getting along about six months before that i married evie knight's daughter the e.t slider son evie knight one of the richest man there is on the ohio river and um he all runs the great factories through there of making these prefab houses and so forth and and slider the e.t slider is a sand and gravel company millionaires children and i had married him and i went back in a place to practice it for about two weeks and going back in a booth and kneeling on a pillow all the pump and everything i ever went through nearly had to go through to marry that couple and when come out while they would this other little couple just stood there in a little room where we had a little couch and a folding bed but they both was married by the same ceremony and then one day i thought i'd go down and visit this rich couple they didn't have to work their fathers are millionaires they build them a nice home frankly this evening night up there on the hill his doorknobs are 14 karat on his big palace so uh you can imagine what kind of home they live in they didn't have to work they had a nice cadillac give to them every year and just only children and they had just everything they wanted when i walked up one day now how i got acquainted with them one of their friends was a good friend of mine we all kind of chummed together and that's how i got acquainted when they wanted me to marry him so um i went up to visit him and i got outside all forward outside walked up the steps and and i got up a little bit too close and i heard them and they were really fussing they were jealous of one another they had been to a dance she was a very pretty girl and she was kind of one of these beauty queens she took many prizes around there and won some cars and things for being beauty queen and i looked at him and one was sitting in one corner and one the other fussing about some boy she danced with her some girl or something when i come up they jumped up real quick and grabbed one other cross the floor in their their hands across the board come walk more towards your door say bye hello there brother brandon how are you getting along i said all right how are you all getting lost and oh he said i i we're very happy aren't we honey and she said yes dear see i see you're putting on something that isn't real now you can't get warm by a painted fire like some of these churches trying to paint pentecost or something happened a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago you can't get warmed by a painted fire a pentecost is just as real today as it was then the fire's still falling it ain't a painted part it's a real power so uh they've just there they were see i i wouldn't want to live like that well i thought you know just down over the cliff there and over on the river there's where this other couple wound up i thought one saturday afternoon i'd slip down there and see how this is getting along so i'm dirty on the face and the dirty overalls on my tools on i thought i'd slip up on them i slept along like i was watching for insulators being cracked by the lightning or something as i walked along side of the telephone wire the electric cables along the river and there's the old chevrolet was sitting out front it was about a year later after i'd married them and there was uh uh the door was open and i can hear him talking so this sounds like a hypocrite but i walked up close enough that i could listen see what they saying stay there and i just want to know for myself i like to find out be sure i know what i'm talking about that's what i do about god's word is it the truth or is it the truth will he keep his word or doesn't he keep his word if he doesn't keep his word then he's not god see he does keep his word he's god and so i wanted to see how they was getting long enough slipped along the side real easy i heard him say well honey i wanted to get that for you so bad she said i look sweetheart she said this dress is all right she said why ah this is just fine so now i appreciate that but you see i slipped around so i could look through the crack where the door been shoved open there in the box car and there he was sitting in there and her on his lap and his arm around her arm around him and he had a one of these old slouched hats and and put a little hole and mashed it down the top and poured out his paycheck and that he was laying it out on the table said so much for groceries so much for insurance and so much uh on the car and they couldn't make their ends meet come to find out he'd seen a little dress up there in a window been looking at it for a couple weeks that cost a dollar and something he wanted to get he said well honey it looks so pretty in it and he said she said but honey i got a dress i don't really need it see and that little queen and i backed off and looked back i could see the steeple on top of the other house i stood there and looked a few minutes i thought who is the rich man [Applause] i thought if bill branham if you want to take which place where would you go for me i take not the that pretty thing up on top would i take this character down here as a real homemaker somebody that loved me and stayed with me somebody tried to make a home and not bleeding for everything for fine reasons somebody that was with you part of you that's always stuck with me of how that was one chose a beautiful girl the other chose character amen i want to be the one that he chooses that's character not looking for beauty there's really no beauty that he should behold us just character just the faith keep the dress keep the comfort keep the nice house i want you though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity and become sinking brat sounding brass tinkling symbol though i have gifts of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains have not charity i'm nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth all in its kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not of itself it is not puffed up it doth not behave itself unseemly and it seeketh not her own it is not easily provoked and it thinketh no evil rejoiceth and no evil and rejoiceth not in iniquity and rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeths all things and hopeths all things and endureth all things charity never faileth but when there's prophecies they'll fail if there's tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall all vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with and we have by god's grace knowing that that perfect has come he's here in the fullness of his word and that's what i wanted from the beginning that's what i wanted so don't talk to me about things that take me away from him don't talk to me about beautiful things i wanted him i've always wanted him i want to see that life not just see it at a distance i wanted to see it living in me expressing in me handling situations the right way and doing things the right way and when it isn't i go back to where i found him i go back where i once found him if he's in church age you know brother banham talks about this in that first church age how did the devil come in he came in by cooling them off and causing them to be formal the fervent desire to please god and a passion to know his word and the cry of the reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it had cooled off and become a bit formal that is what was happening back there in ephesians they were getting formal the abandonment to god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god thought of them as they began to think about a careful about what the world was thinking of them that second generation coming on was just like israel they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected god and they did it but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to start doing the things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress and their attitudes and their behaviors they get lacks because the word ephesus means relaxed and drifting israel chose a king a great man a false church wants to choose great men and put great men in their position to always do the spiritual work that they should be doing themselves always putting something between them and god that's what we don't want we want a spiritual man yeah we want godly men yup we want them constantly pointing us to christ all the time i delivered my heart i think i'm done musicians will you come i am if you left your first love go back where you left him remember the story asked an old soldier who was dying he said you better find the lord real quick he said i don't know where he's at he said will you go back where you left him and he says now i lay me down to sleep i pray the soul my lord my soul to keep and if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take what brother bam said he said he found him right where he left him he found him right where he left him i believe it's real simple i honestly believe it's simpler than what sometimes we think it is i really do if he wants me to know something he'll reveal it to me it's not my ability i've got none and the sooner i came to that realization the better off i am and the better off we'll all be is realizing we can't do nothing right we never could do anything right all i know to do is love him and pursue him with everything that's in me seeking knock keep pressing having not yet apprehended i'm pressing toward that mark of the high calling in christ jesus i saw something you know you all did too when you heard brother branham's voice for the first time you heard those sermons you saw jesus you know you did you saw truth you saw honesty you saw something you had never seen before but life difficulties people situations oh how it can cause you to cool off sometimes but you know what you had to take your eyes off jesus for that to happen you had to take your eyes off of the presence of god in the in the midst of the people and take your eyes off of him to see the problems you had to but god in his mercy he comes to you like he did to me why don't you stand let's have a word of prayer i pray that the simplicity of it means something to you if anything i just you know and i know and the kids know because they know what i preached before brother chad preached if god is wanting anything he wants sincerity he wants honesty he wants to be loved he doesn't need your formal works i don't even know so much if he's so concerned with your service if in the right term you have to take me in the right way but in your pursuit and your desire to do what he wants him to do because you love him not because you're pressured to do the right things because hey we all believe it right that's a badass that's a bad motivation i don't believe a sister should wear a dress because she doesn't be ostracized by the people she associates with i believe a sister should wear a dress because she wants to please god i believe a man who hears water baptism name the lord jesus christ i don't believe he does that because he doesn't want to be thought of bad no i believe something inside of him says i want to please god i want to do what he wants me to do i want to be what he wants me to be i love him i love him and when you keep that in its right perspective everything else falls right in line why don't we just bow heavenly father lord we come before you so thankful for this evening lord i'm thankful for your word how i've just enjoyed the day basking in it i so enjoy the fact that i know i'm in the presence of the king i so enjoy how your tender hand corrects us it's always remedial lord you're always correcting us to turn us and point us to the thing that we desire most and that's you lord i'm so appreciative of that i'm so thankful for that and i know we as a people are thankful for that we don't take it for granted i don't take it for granted and lord i just pray that you'd help us lord that we could recognize you not to be the god that was or the god that will be not to be a creed or a dogma or a doctrine but a present tense resurrection the king is in the camp lord i just pray that you bless the people i pray lord if i said anything wrong you know it wasn't my heart's desire i meant to say what just what you wanted me to say something that would help your people that's all i ever want to be lord is to be a service to you and your people lord i just pray that you'd bless them lord bless us this week may lord we find you early in the morning lord if there be any that's cooled off lord if there's be any lord that are hiding behind a false fig leaf of religious activities lord i pray that we would throw that down be willing to come into your presence exposing us lord if need be but lord we we don't care we just want to be with you we want to be in your presence we want to be quiet enough in our nature and in our spirit to hear your heart's desire as you were speaking to martha that day father that's our desire lord we love you we commit ourselves to you and all the words that have been said may be pondering and glorifying to you in jesus name amen [Music] [Music] [Music] first [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh praise god how many of you just want to love him more amen just want to express it and want him to know by our pursuit amen i just want god knows what's in your heart god knows what who you are but i still want to demonstrate my love amen god knows it i know he knows it but i think he enjoys seeing it amen and i think everything brother kyle went through and all his struggle and his questions and his quiet time with the lord i believe it was for me you believe it was for you one thing i realized more and more as brother kyle was preaching as we use terms of we when we preach we we speak collectively because we believe as individuals we all have the same desire and in the the same goals and the same faith and so we speak in collective terms a lot of times but what i realize more and more is really what god wants is me not the collective term but i he wants me he wants to love me and he wants me to love him back he wants a relationship with me he wants a love affair with me and i want to love affair personally with him with nobody else involved and it's it's about the individual we believe that god is good god is merciful and i truly want to love him more i was blessed by the message tonight and i sat there and marveled as i watched god do it again god and so many conversations that i've had and today in the last few days god was speaking right back to things that i needed conversations i had and things i needed to hear and i watched him do it again and he made himself known by the breaking of bread to me and i thank him for that man god bless you we love you we're going to let you be dismissed but let's just thank him quickly before we go lord we thank you i want to bow my head and i want to say thank you lord thank you for the reminder lord thank you for the direction thank you lord for stirring up within us that love that we have for you we know it's impossible that we could ever love you unless you first loved us and that speaks of predestination and election [Music] without predestination and election in us we would never be able to love you back but oh god how much we love you and how thankful we are that you've called us that you've chosen us before the foundation of the world help us lord to stay in touch with that that revelation lord that uniqueness and the specialness lord that we have with you because of what you've done god help us never to cool off forgive us lord forgive us for letting the world distract us forgive us for letting other people become a distraction forgive us for our laziness lord and maybe not even for our laziness forgive us for our works when our works become a substitute for relationship help us lord not to go that way we're thankful that you spoke to us in a very intimate way tonight to remind us of our first love to remind us of what it is that you're after lord for you weren't after works but you're after love you're after a bride that will love you back knowing that with the right relationship all the right works will be in place god i just want to say you're my treasure you're my treasure lord god i pray that you would help us to keep you first in our lives we pray to bless our brother kyle to strengthen him lord that you would continue to use him for your glory and that you would restore unto him all that's been given out now for each one of us when we get may we leave here lord with our hearts centered on you with our affection centered on you lord may you just be what our eye is learning focusing on being trained to at all times not to be distracted by anything else religion formalism troubles whatever may come our way may none of those things move us lord but may our eye be focused singularly on you and may we never lose sight of you while we praise you and we thank you for your goodness to us and your blessings upon us may they are behind as we go from here lord go with us let us walk with you every day we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen i was speaking to brother franco today and i use this analogy and it's amazing i said i feel with the things that the lord has opened up and the things we've been ministering on lately i feel like a little lamb a little sheep surrounded by wolves and these wolves are all these demon spirits religious spirits and all kinds of other spirits that want to devour this little lamb and we're walking through the valley of the shadow of death but he says fear not for i am with thee [Music] and this is the analogy that i just explained to brother franco i feel like it's a razor's edge because you could be so focused on the wolves that you lose all your joy you lose all your peace you lose sight of him but on the other hand you can be so content that i have a shepherd and i'm safe and i'm protected and everything's okay that you stop looking at him [Music] and you get you get to the point where you say well i'm a sheep of his fold i'm special he watches over me and everything's fine with me and you failed to stay close to the shepherd and the shepherd's always moving and we can get so content every denomination has got so content they stop moving with the shepherd and as soon as they stop moving with the shepherd the wolves closed in amen we can never get to the place where we're so content that we don't have to constantly watch the shepherd and move when he moves [Music] but if our eyes are on the shepherd and we move with him then we have joy amen we have peace we have delivered there's nothing to be worried about there's nothing to be afraid of there's nothing to fret over because the wolves can't get to you in the presence of the shepherd and i don't want to be so worried about the wolves that i forget that i'm in the presence of the shepherd and i don't want to be so content am i calling that i forget to look at the shepherd because i can get off either way but i just want to be happy and serve him and keep my eye focused on him and when he moves i move when he stops i stop and wherever he is i'm safe from all these forces that are trying to devour his sheep [Music] say god has us right where he wants us completely dependent upon him that's where i want to be god bless you as we go this evening brother ben let's sing here i am i give all myself to the lord here here i am [Applause] me here i am give all myself to the lord here i [Music] your am move through me lord hear us speak to me i give all thyself to the lord speak to me [Music] [Music] here i am here i am here i am [Music] lord here i am [Music] in my [Music] [Music] in my life lord be glorified in my [Music] my [Music] in your church [Music] forever [Music] church [Music] glorify [Music] [Music] let you sing in my life one more time [Music] [Music] just make that your prayer this evening [Music] over my soul [Music] over my soul my rest is complete while i sit at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul [Music] sweep over my [Music] sweep over my [Music] is complete while i sit at your [Music] [Applause] [Music] to come to thy river to thy river oh lord cause me to come to thy river [Music] cause me [Music] you
