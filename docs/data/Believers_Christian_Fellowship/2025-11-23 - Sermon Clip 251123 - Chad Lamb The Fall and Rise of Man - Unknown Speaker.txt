========================================

And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever." &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT? THIS IS THE WEEPING ONE. BEFORE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, he's weeping BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. BUT NOW, THERE WAS A MAN that could come forth AND TAKE THE BOOK. AND WHEN HE TOOK THE BOOK, ALL HEAVEN ERUPTED IN PRAISE. And when heaven ERUPTED IN PRAISE, AS SOON AS THERE WAS A PAUSE, WE HEAR JOHN, WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE BRIDE. HE SAID, "EVERYTHING THAT EVER WAS in heaven, ON EARTH, UNDER THE EARTH, IN THE SEA, AND ALL THAT THERE IS HEARD ME LISTEN, THAT MUST BE SOME SORT OF PRAISING THAT HE WAS DOING, SAYING, "BLESSING." AMEN. He He said, "Oh, praise God." I want to read it the way HE SAID IT. HE SAID, UH, BLESSING AND HONOR AND GLORY AND POWER BE UNTO HIM THAT SITETH UPON THE throne and unto the lamb FOREVER AND EVER. OH, PRAISE GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. THIS IS REDEMPTION. PRAISE GOD. WHAT ADAM LOST HAS COME BACK INTO THE HANDS OF MAN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE. THERE WAS A MAN WHO SAT THROUGH INTERCESSION THROUGH SEVEN CHURCH AGE TO MAKE SURE HIS BRIDE WAS SECURE. BUT AT THE END TIME, HE CAME FORTH TO TAKE HIS POSSESSION, HIS INHERITANCE, HIS RIGHTS. AND HE'S COME DOWN TO UNITE WITH HIS BRIDE. PRAISE GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; WHO? The man. Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Our headship, our king, our Lord, our brother. &gt;&gt; He took the book. That's what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; People get caught up in he said this here and this here and the rules about this and can I do this and LISTEN THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHY THE MESSENGER CAME. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY HE CAME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WERE LOCKED DOWN IN DENOMINATIONALISM. WE WERE BLINDED AND DARKENED AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHERE WE WERE GOING, WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THE MESSENGER CAME TO TAKE GOD THROUGH THAT MESSENGER TOOK THE VEIL OFF THE BIBLE. SO WE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHY WE'RE FALLEN, WHAT WE LOST, HOW IT GETS REDEEMED, WHO REDEEMED IT. AND SO THAT WE COULD REALIZE WE LIVE IN THE DAY it's redeemed. IT'S REDEEMED. IT'S REDEEMED. WHICH MEANS I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED. AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE CAME DOWN THE MIGHTY ANGEL. HE came down WITH AN OPEN BOOK IN HIS HAND TO DO WHAT? HE CAME DOWN TO UNITE WITH WHAT HE REDEEMED. AND THE FIRST PART OF THAT UNITING TAKES PLACE WITH A BRIDE, A PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING. AND HE UNITES with them first. &gt;&gt; And this IS UNITING TIME AND SIGNS. &gt;&gt; This is what the message is about. &gt;&gt; Everything else feeds into this. This is the purpose.
