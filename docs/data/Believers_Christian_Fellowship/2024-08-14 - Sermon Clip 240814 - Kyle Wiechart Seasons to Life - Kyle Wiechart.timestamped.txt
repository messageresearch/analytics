[0:00] and as I've been looking at these
[0:01] Seasons to life there's not a one of us
[0:03] that doesn't go through some major
[0:05] changes in
[0:07] Seasons churches go through
[0:10] Seasons families go through Seasons
[0:13] individuals go through Seasons all of us
[0:17] go through certain times when everything
[0:20] changes and sometimes it's not like a
[0:23] meat cleav it's it's kind of it fades
[0:26] from one season to another you ever see
[0:28] the springtime and you know exact moment
[0:30] it becomes summer no you just realize
[0:34] huh we're in summertime now same when
[0:37] summer goes into fall fall goes into
[0:39] winter you don't know the exact time but
[0:41] you know the season changed you know the
[0:43] atmosphere is different you know
[0:45] everything's about to to change that has
[0:47] life you know life responds to that
[0:50] change in the season anything with life
[0:53] responds to the change and that season
[0:56] is caused by the Sun the sunlight
[1:00] changes the season its
[1:02] position and so does the the sunlight
[1:05] light up different portions of the word
[1:07] at different times for That season how
[1:11] many of you all you've read the Bible
[1:12] you read the same scriptures the same
[1:14] quotes over and over for years and it
[1:16] was good you you amen but then one day
[1:20] during a certain time and a certain
[1:22] season of your life it jumps off the
[1:25] page and almost smacks you in the face
[1:26] and you're like have I ever read that
[1:28] before and you know you read it before
[1:31] but the light now has brought it into
[1:33] view because it's a season for that word
[1:35] to be manifested in your life it's just
[1:38] a changing of seasons and not only do I
[1:41] believe the Earth is changing it's going
[1:44] through a major change we all feel the
[1:46] change is happening we know it even
[1:49] non-christians are looking and talking
[1:51] to me saying my goodness it's about to
[1:53] get bad they know the world is
[1:56] changing the churches know the world is
[1:59] changing
[2:00] the bride certainly I hope knows that
[2:03] everything is
[2:05] changing we're changing we're going from
[2:07] one season into another season we're
[2:11] going into the very depths of the
[2:13] Harvest time and that's the season I'm
[2:16] going to focus on tonight because that's
[2:17] the season it's no longer the springtime
[2:20] the planting season where there's an
[2:22] abundance of rain to bring in massive
[2:24] amounts of crops it's now the ripening
[2:28] time it's now the time time where
[2:30] everything
[2:32] dies everything begins to die and then
[2:37] you begin to think something's wrong no
[2:41] it's the season of
[2:43] death to make way for life
