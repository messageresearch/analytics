[5:45] let's take our bibles and go to john
[5:47] chapter one
[5:50] and then i wanted to give you updated
[5:52] details for the memorial service for
[5:54] brother john morrow who have the service
[5:56] this saturday at 11 a.m here in the
[5:59] sanctuary so if you're able to make that

[6:04] but we'll have that here
[6:06] saturday january 29th it's this saturday
[6:08] at 11 a.m and then there'll be a
[6:10] luncheon to follow in the fellowship
[6:12] hall so we can gather there with the
[6:14] family
[6:16] i want to say a special thanks for
[6:18] brother keith and sister lee hunting god
[6:20] bless you it's good to have you here
[6:22] you're very welcome but when they heard
[6:24] that brother john wasn't doing well
[6:26] sister nancy had called them
[6:29] in the morning
[6:30] and they called him in the morning i
[6:32] think it was friday morning that she
[6:34] called them and they said we want to
[6:36] come up so i stopped at the hospital
[6:38] friday morning and talked to sister
[6:39] nancy and she said
[6:40] brother keith and sister lee are coming
[6:42] up and i said oh that'll be good and i
[6:43] was thinking they'll be here tomorrow or
[6:45] the next day or or whatever and at the
[6:47] end of the day i stopped back by in the
[6:49] evening like 5 30 and i opened the door
[6:51] and they were there
[6:53] and i said how did you get here so fast
[6:55] and god just supernaturally put all the
[6:57] pieces together
[6:58] and it was so wonderful not only could
[7:00] they be here
[7:01] to see brother john before he passed
[7:03] away but they've been able to stay with
[7:05] sister nancy and help take care of her
[7:06] and comfort her and so god bless you we
[7:09] thank you so much for that and i'm so
[7:11] glad that god worked that out that way
[7:13] for her amen so remember to keep her in
[7:16] prayer and that god will support her and
[7:17] sustain her and undergird her through
[7:19] this time
[7:20] and uh that the lord will bless the
[7:22] memorial service coming up this saturday
[7:24] so we very much appreciate your prayers
[7:27] amen let's turn to the scripture here
[7:29] and begin reading in john chapter 1
[7:31] verse 1.
[7:33] it says
[7:34] in the beginning was the word
[7:36] and the word was with god
[7:38] and the word was god
[7:41] we're going to let you have your seats
[7:42] with that and ask the lord to bless the
[7:44] reading of his word
[7:46] amen
[7:47] there's just a few things that are on my
[7:49] heart that i like to share
[7:52] you know from sunday i we finished up
[7:54] sunday and the lord really blessed us
[7:55] with the word on sunday and i i was very
[7:57] much edified and i went home monday and
[7:59] i was up in the morning monday morning
[8:01] reading through the bible and i took out
[8:03] some of my notes and i'm just reading
[8:05] through some handwritten notes and and
[8:07] as i was reading through that i just was
[8:09] enjoying it all over again monday
[8:11] morning and there was something that i
[8:12] wrote down
[8:14] that that i didn't get to
[8:16] on uh
[8:17] on sunday and i thought um i'd like to
[8:19] share that so that's where this stems
[8:21] from today but i'd like to title this
[8:23] the thought expressed
[8:25] the thought expressed and
[8:28] and we know that that comes from this
[8:30] word here in genesis or sorry john
[8:33] chapter one verse one in the beginning
[8:34] was the word
[8:35] that that word that's translated word
[8:38] into english comes from the greek word
[8:39] logos and we'll get to the meaning of
[8:41] that in just a minute but we know that
[8:43] logos is a thought expressed is what
[8:45] brother brenham told us and that's what
[8:47] we want to talk about today
[8:49] and the message the way back brother
[8:51] brennan says and if you say you believe
[8:52] god and deny his word well then you
[8:55] don't believe god because god is his
[8:57] word
[8:59] let's just make it that simple can we
[9:00] have it that simple
[9:03] if you say you believe god and deny his
[9:05] word well then you don't believe god
[9:06] because god is his word
[9:09] you know it sounds so simple yeah we
[9:10] yeah that's a piece of cake we believe
[9:13] that but you realize then to deny the
[9:16] word of god is to deny god because god
[9:19] is his word
[9:21] and so you know what was
[9:23] satan's tactics amen when he met jesus
[9:26] in the wilderness he was constantly
[9:28] trying to get jesus to deviate from the
[9:31] word and and how was he trying to get
[9:34] jesus to deviate from the word he was
[9:37] using the word to get jesus to deviate
[9:39] from the word
[9:41] so he would use scripture
[9:44] and he would use jesus's calling in his
[9:46] position as the son of god which is it
[9:49] was his manifested word so jesus as the
[9:52] son of god was the manifested word he
[9:54] tried to use his position as the
[9:56] manifested word amen he tried to use the
[9:59] scripture amen he tried to use the
[10:01] supernatural amen which is also a
[10:03] product of the word he tried all of
[10:05] these things to get jesus off the word
[10:08] and he was using things from the word to
[10:11] get him off the word
[10:14] and that's the that's been the trick of
[10:16] the devil all along and we see that
[10:18] coming in amen through the through the
[10:21] systems of man through the denominations
[10:23] and the systems of man they've been
[10:25] using scripture
[10:27] to deviate off of the word and like we
[10:30] said sunday you can have the scripture
[10:32] and not have the word
[10:34] amen
[10:35] because the word is the thought
[10:37] expressed so the word the true word of
[10:40] god contains god's thought about that
[10:43] word so if we agree if we quote the word
[10:47] without god's thought attached to that
[10:49] word and we have our thought
[10:52] what we think that word means then we've
[10:55] deviated off the word
[10:58] but we may be reading the scripture and
[11:00] reading it correctly the way it's
[11:01] written in the bible so we can correctly
[11:04] read the the scripture with the way it's
[11:06] written but if we don't catch the
[11:08] thought amen and we inject our thought
[11:12] into the reading of that scripture then
[11:14] it's no longer the word amen it's no
[11:16] longer the word of god it's no longer
[11:18] the word it becomes perverted word
[11:23] so we say you know if you believe god
[11:25] and deny his word then you don't believe
[11:27] god because god is his word amen you
[11:30] have to realize we when we're talking
[11:33] now and the depth of deception that the
[11:35] devil has laid down the devil is not
[11:38] amen he's not trying to deceive us into
[11:41] you know into believing
[11:43] uh uh some far-fetched thing or are
[11:46] our way way way out and in the middle of
[11:49] nowhere kind of a deception to get us
[11:51] pulled off to where we no longer you
[11:53] know believe that the message is true
[11:56] and no what he can do is write with the
[11:58] message the quotes and the scriptures
[12:01] were taken to the message try to deviate
[12:03] us from god's
[12:05] thought about the message
[12:07] [Music]
[12:08] until we start taking our thinking about
[12:11] the message and it brings a perverted
[12:14] word
[12:15] so the devil and the deception when he
[12:18] came to jesus he was using the word he
[12:20] used the scriptures to try to get jesus
[12:23] to move off of god's purpose and plan
[12:26] for his life and deviate from the word
[12:28] so you can see how important it is amen
[12:31] that we don't inject our own idea so
[12:34] this is actually a lot more difficult
[12:36] than we think so we re we hear this
[12:38] quote and we think yeah that's easy i
[12:40] would you know i have no desire to deny
[12:42] his word but the devil's not trying to
[12:44] get you to say that this scripture is
[12:46] not even belonging in the bible you know
[12:49] he's not trying to get you to say that
[12:51] brother branham was never a prophet amen
[12:53] if he can just get you to deny the
[12:56] correct interpretation of the word and
[12:59] take a different interpretation of the
[13:01] word he's just as effective
[13:07] so
[13:10] like i said there's so many things on my
[13:11] heart so just bear with me as i just
[13:13] share from my heart
[13:15] god
[13:16] was so good to us in this day to give us
[13:19] the complete revelation of his word
[13:23] now how many believe that through the
[13:24] message we have the complete revelation
[13:26] of the word the full mind of god has
[13:29] been restored back into the church we
[13:31] have the perfect interpretation of the
[13:33] word with divine vindication
[13:37] amen
[13:39] so
[13:40] so what we have is by the grace of god
[13:44] is something that will defeat the devil
[13:46] any place any time under any condition
[13:50] but we have to take it the way god gave
[13:53] it to us amen
[13:54] we can't change it or alter it we can't
[13:57] begin to massage the message
[14:01] we we shouldn't apologize for the way
[14:03] brother ben says things
[14:05] [Applause]
[14:06] we put and shouldn't apologize for the
[14:08] way he used his scriptures
[14:11] because you know even brother brennaman
[14:13] and when he was uh alive he was telling
[14:16] us you know that uh some man uh uh we
[14:19] assume is probably somebody with a great
[14:21] education was coming to brother branham
[14:23] and saying brother branham you don't
[14:24] even know your bible
[14:26] and the man was talking about you know
[14:29] the actual text or the pronunciations or
[14:32] whatever he's talking about the
[14:34] grammarization or whatever you don't
[14:35] even know the bible brother ben said
[14:37] that may be true but i know the author
[14:39] real well
[14:41] now listen if you want to get grammar
[14:44] and you want to get greek amen then then
[14:46] then you just know your bible really
[14:48] well but if you want the logos the word
[14:51] you need to know the author really well
[14:53] because this word that is written down
[14:56] here is a written expression of a
[14:58] thought god had in his mind
[15:00] and so in order to have the true word
[15:04] that's why brother benham also said
[15:06] it this way he said they've been you say
[15:09] we try to get a better bible better
[15:11] translated off the greek brother brenham
[15:13] said they've been arguing about the
[15:15] greek for over a thousand years
[15:18] you can't get two greek scholars to
[15:20] agree and so how can we with a better
[15:22] interpretation of the word come up with
[15:24] a true translation of the word amen the
[15:27] only way to have a true translation of
[15:29] the word is not to get a better greek
[15:31] dictionary or a better understanding of
[15:33] a greek but to get the true
[15:35] interpretation has to come from the
[15:37] author of the word because the true
[15:39] interpretation contains the thought of
[15:42] that word because that's the true
[15:44] interpretation of that word
[15:47] so i'd like to ask you in the day and
[15:49] age that we live in how will you ever
[15:51] get the correct interpretation of your
[15:53] bible without the message that god has
[15:55] given us
[15:56] how can you reject the prophet to get
[15:59] the correct translation of a bible verse
[16:02] and without a prophet amen how will you
[16:05] know that what you came up with
[16:08] was what was in the back part of god's
[16:10] mind before the foundation of the world
[16:11] [Music]
[16:13] i want to go to the one who knows the
[16:15] author really well
[16:17] [Music]
[16:18] for instance you can find a note of mine
[16:20] i can write out a note and some thoughts
[16:22] of mine and i can drop it somewhere and
[16:24] you can pick it up and have my signature
[16:26] and it's got you can say oh brother chad
[16:28] this is he said this and he said that
[16:30] and you think you understand what i'm
[16:32] saying but if you want a better
[16:33] understanding of what i'm saying give
[16:35] that note to my wife
[16:38] and she'll translate it for you
[16:41] because she knows the author really well
[16:45] you can be like oh brother chad said
[16:47] this and this and he'd be like no he
[16:49] always misspells that word listen
[16:52] that's not what he meant
[16:54] he can't spell that
[16:58] because she knows the author really well
[17:01] and so if i want the correct translation
[17:04] of god's love letter to me i want to go
[17:06] to somebody who knows the author
[17:08] [Music]
[17:09] and further than that i have to get into
[17:12] the same spirit that that man was in
[17:14] [Music]
[17:16] i can't come with a different spirit
[17:18] because if i come with a different
[17:19] spirit and don't have the spirit of the
[17:21] author without the spirit of the it was
[17:23] the spirit of the author of the bible
[17:25] who gave the message to the prophet
[17:28] brother bram didn't come up with the
[17:29] message
[17:31] it was given to him by the author of our
[17:33] bible
[17:34] the author of our bible is the author of
[17:36] the message
[17:36] [Music]
[17:38] and so i have to have the same spirit as
[17:40] the author of the bible and to author
[17:42] the message to come to the mess to get
[17:44] the correct translation of the message
[17:48] so we have to be careful how we handle
[17:50] the word
[17:51] and so
[17:52] too many people are arguing over the
[17:53] word amen and when you just have to get
[17:56] into the spirit of the word and trust
[17:58] god's mechanism for delivering his word
[18:00] which was that prophet
[18:03] it's when we which when we it's when
[18:06] we get convinced in our mind that we
[18:09] can't trust the prophet because of his
[18:11] grammar or his reading
[18:13] or his this or that when when somehow
[18:16] somebody
[18:18] uh deceives us into believing that we
[18:20] can't trust the prophet
[18:22] we're going to get off into into
[18:25] terrible places
[18:28] that prophet of god was led of the lord
[18:30] and he he was given the perfect
[18:33] interpretation of the word with divine
[18:34] vindication
[18:36] and let me go a little further
[18:39] so i can keep with this thought let's go
[18:41] over to john 1 verse 14
[18:44] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[18:46] among us and we beheld his glory the
[18:48] glory is the only begotten of the father
[18:50] full of grace and truth so in the
[18:53] beginning was the word and the word was
[18:55] with god and the word was god and
[18:57] brother branham said and because god is
[19:00] his word and that word was made flesh so
[19:04] in the very very beginning god had
[19:06] thoughts and those thoughts when those
[19:08] thoughts were expressed became word and
[19:10] they could be spoken word they can be
[19:12] written word but those thoughts
[19:14] expressed became word
[19:16] then then
[19:18] those words amen come into a
[19:20] manifestation and become manifested word
[19:23] our living word and the word was made
[19:26] flesh and all that god had in this
[19:28] thought all of the word that was in god
[19:31] in his thinking amen becomes into flesh
[19:34] in jesus christ and becomes not written
[19:37] word or spoken word but now manifested
[19:40] word
[19:42] so jesus christ he's standing on earth
[19:45] and he's the very manifested word with
[19:48] the full thought of god in him he is the
[19:52] revelation of god
[19:55] amen
[19:57] and the pharisees thought they knew the
[19:58] law better than him
[20:01] and the pharisees would challenge him on
[20:03] the word on the scriptures on the law
[20:06] amen but here he was he was all of that
[20:09] amen was poured into him and he was the
[20:11] very manifestation of of the full
[20:14] thought of god he was the manifestation
[20:16] of god he was the word made flesh he was
[20:20] manifested word standing there and they
[20:22] thought that he wasn't handling the word
[20:25] correctly and they were trying to
[20:26] correct him by the law and here he was
[20:30] the manifestation of everything that was
[20:32] written in that law
[20:35] so we look at the pharisees and just
[20:37] shake our heads like
[20:38] how could you i mean how could you argue
[20:41] with him how could you question him how
[20:43] could you do anything like that but the
[20:45] sad part is there'll be people who claim
[20:47] to believe this message will do the very
[20:49] same thing with the prophet of god
[20:52] for instance the prophet of god will
[20:54] tell us to avoid interracial marriage
[20:56] and you know how many times that's been
[20:58] explained away
[21:00] people will explain that away and say
[21:02] well you know in the bible and moses had
[21:04] an ethiopian wife and this and that and
[21:07] you know somebody told me that one time
[21:08] when moses had an ethiopian wife and i
[21:10] said david had 500 wives i mean
[21:14] try that one out
[21:17] just because god permitted it in a
[21:19] previous age doesn't mean doesn't make
[21:21] it work in the next age when more light
[21:24] comes because when more light comes more
[21:26] is required
[21:28] when more revelation comes more of a
[21:30] life is required david could have 500
[21:32] wives amen but you can't
[21:35] so just because those things took place
[21:37] before does not mean that they're
[21:39] appropriate now and if a prophet of god
[21:42] teaches something over and over and over
[21:45] again i mean this isn't something it's
[21:47] not a one-off statement it's not
[21:48] something that said in obscurity this is
[21:50] something he teaches over and over and
[21:53] he bases it on the very nature of god
[21:56] because he said god is a god of variety
[21:58] god made this flower this color and he
[22:00] wants them to stay just that way he
[22:02] doesn't want him to mix and brother
[22:03] branham says that so i'm just using this
[22:05] as an example where people will come and
[22:07] say but i don't know the scripture that
[22:09] he used for that and i see about moses
[22:12] and i see in the old testament they did
[22:14] this and this and i'm just going to take
[22:16] what brother bannon said and move it
[22:18] over here and and then we'll say things
[22:20] like you know that was his opinion now
[22:22] he was coming up in the 60s and there
[22:24] was major racial things taking place in
[22:25] the 60s so the environment he was in was
[22:28] influencing his opinion
[22:33] i'm telling if you start down that road
[22:36] that's a dead-end road
[22:38] that'll bring major problems
[22:41] he does this on marriage and divorce he
[22:43] does this on the qualifications of a
[22:45] minister brother branham he he knows the
[22:48] author real well
[22:50] and when he's telling you and he is the
[22:52] one who has the revelation that's been
[22:54] in the back part of god's mind since
[22:56] before the foundation of the world amen
[22:59] he
[23:01] he has
[23:02] he has been given revelation that has
[23:05] been secret and withheld from every
[23:07] other prophet amen down through time
[23:11] there's there's never been a prophet
[23:12] like this prophet amen outside of jesus
[23:15] christ this is the prophet that's going
[23:17] to come and take the veil off the entire
[23:20] word which prophet did that before
[23:25] then how could we come along
[23:28] and start saying well that was his
[23:30] opinion
[23:31] and i don't see where he got that
[23:36] see it won't be long until the devil
[23:37] will have us in a perversion of the word
[23:41] taking our own thinking
[23:44] and moving in directions by our own
[23:46] thinking
[23:48] so if brother branham said this is the
[23:50] qualifications for a minister
[23:53] that's the qualifications for a minister
[23:55] if you said this is what this is what
[23:57] this is what god wants in our marriages
[23:59] this is who he wants us to marry not
[24:00] marry then that's who god wants us to
[24:02] marry and not marry
[24:04] if he says these are who can get
[24:06] remarried and these can't get remarried
[24:08] then that's who can get married who
[24:09] can't get remarried
[24:12] you see what a disrespect it is to the
[24:14] prophet of god
[24:16] to just totally disregard what he taught
[24:21] because we know better
[24:24] i say god help us
[24:26] never to have that let's humble
[24:27] ourselves
[24:28] to what god has given us in this day
[24:32] in the pergameon church age
[24:36] brother brother says now we can see his
[24:38] association with the word he is the word
[24:41] that is who he is
[24:43] the word in his name
[24:45] in john 1 1 where it says in the
[24:47] beginning was the word the root from
[24:49] which we get our translation for word is
[24:51] logos which means the thought or concept
[24:53] it has the double meaning of thought and
[24:55] speech now a thought expressed is a word
[24:58] or words isn't that wonderful and
[25:01] beautiful john says the concept of god
[25:03] was expressed in jesus
[25:06] so jesus was the word the logos because
[25:08] the concept of god was expressed in
[25:10] jesus
[25:11] so this is where brother tells us that
[25:13] this is one of many places he tells us
[25:15] that a thought expresses the word when
[25:17] you look in the in the concordance it
[25:18] actually even uses this language it says
[25:21] a word that embodies
[25:23] embodies a concept or idea so it's not
[25:26] just something that's written down the
[25:28] word embodies within it the concept or
[25:31] idea that the person who wrote the word
[25:34] or the person who came up with the word
[25:36] it was the concept or idea that they had
[25:38] with that word
[25:40] so in order to have the correct
[25:41] interpretation of the word we have to
[25:43] have god's concept or idea of what he
[25:46] meant by that word
[25:48] praise god
[25:50] i want to take a
[25:52] a look at luke chapter 6
[25:55] together
[26:04] luke chapter 6
[26:06] and verse 1.
[26:17] and it came to pass on the second
[26:19] sabbath after the first that he went
[26:20] through the cornfields
[26:22] and his disciples plucked the ears of
[26:24] corn and did eat rubbing them in their
[26:26] hands
[26:27] and certain of the pharisees said unto
[26:29] them why do you do that which is not
[26:30] lawful to do on the sabbath days this is
[26:33] what these are these are these
[26:34] statements in the bible that i find so
[26:37] shocking because we know who this was
[26:40] this is the very word himself and then
[26:42] says why are you violating the word the
[26:44] word can't violate the word
[26:47] so their understanding of what moses
[26:50] meant amen wasn't the correct
[26:52] interpretation of the word although they
[26:54] have words that they can read and come
[26:56] up with that conclusion they were
[26:57] missing something amen
[27:00] and it says pluck the ears of corn and
[27:02] did eat rubbing them in their hands
[27:03] verse two and certain of the pharisees
[27:05] said unto them why do you that which is
[27:07] not lawful to do on the sabbath days and
[27:09] jesus answered them and said have you
[27:11] not read so much as this what david did
[27:13] when when himself was a hunger and they
[27:16] which were with him how he went to the
[27:18] house of god and did take and eat the
[27:20] show bread and gave also to them that
[27:22] were with him which it is not lawful to
[27:25] eat but for the priest alone and he said
[27:28] unto them that the son of man is lord
[27:30] also of the sabbath
[27:32] and it came to pass also
[27:34] on another sabbath that he entered into
[27:36] the synagogue and taught and there was a
[27:38] man whose right hand was withered and
[27:40] the scribes and the pharisees watched
[27:42] him whether he would heal on the sabbath
[27:44] day that they might find an accusation
[27:47] against him
[27:49] but he knew their thoughts and said to
[27:51] the man which had the withered hand rise
[27:53] up and stand forth in the midst and he
[27:55] arose and stood forth then said jesus
[27:58] unto them i will ask you one thing
[28:01] is it lawful on the sabbath days to do
[28:03] good or to do evil to save life or to
[28:06] destroy it
[28:08] and looking around about upon them all
[28:12] he said unto the man stretch forth thy
[28:14] hand
[28:15] and he did so and his hand was restored
[28:18] whole as the other and they were filled
[28:20] with madness
[28:23] look at this scripture
[28:24] they were filled with madness and
[28:26] commune one with another what they might
[28:29] do to jesus
[28:31] listen
[28:32] they were so consumed with their own
[28:35] understanding of the scriptures
[28:38] and here they are
[28:41] looking at the word made flesh in front
[28:43] of them the very revelation of god the
[28:46] manifested word was there and they were
[28:49] so locked down on text that they could
[28:53] read them print and
[28:55] and marks amen and with their own
[28:57] interpretation and they had gotten it so
[28:59] wound up with their own will and their
[29:01] own thoughts amen that they had missed
[29:03] the original thought of god when when he
[29:06] gave that scripture and here jesus is
[29:08] here and they're wanting to see whether
[29:10] he'll heal a man and these people are so
[29:13] twisted up in their minds on the word
[29:16] that they would rather a man stay
[29:18] crippled
[29:20] they would prefer that a man stay
[29:23] crippled in his arm there that be healed
[29:26] on the sabbath day so that that so that
[29:29] their understanding of the scripture
[29:31] will stay intact
[29:35] so that their power over the people so
[29:37] that their influence and so that their
[29:39] own interpretation they value their own
[29:42] interpretation of the word so much they
[29:44] do not want a man to go free would
[29:47] prefer he would stay bound on the
[29:49] sabbath day to keep their interpretation
[29:51] of the word intact
[29:54] that is wickedness
[29:58] and jesus says i ask you one thing
[30:02] is it better to do good on the sabbath
[30:04] day or to do evil i love the way jesus
[30:07] asks questions because there's no way
[30:09] they're going to answer
[30:11] they're saying well i mean
[30:13] well i mean you can't heal them but i
[30:16] can't say evil
[30:19] so we'll just keep quiet
[30:21] they asked jesus by what authority do
[30:23] you do these things when he ran the
[30:24] money changes out of the temple and he
[30:25] said well i'll ask you one question you
[30:26] answer mine i'll answer yours
[30:28] you know the the ministry of john was it
[30:31] of god or as of man and all of a sudden
[30:32] they they're put in a quandary they
[30:34] can't answer either way because they
[30:36] have no ability within themselves to be
[30:38] honest they're not interested in the
[30:39] honest interpretation of the word
[30:41] they're interested in keeping their
[30:42] position and the facade before the
[30:44] people and being the experts and having
[30:46] the correct that's all they care about
[30:50] and so they're so wicked that they would
[30:53] rather a man-state and when
[30:56] jesus christ amen says sets forth thy
[30:59] hand and the man was made every bit
[31:00] whole there was not one drop of
[31:02] rejoicing in their hearts for the man
[31:04] that was made whole they were filled
[31:06] with madness because jesus destroyed
[31:09] their interpretation of the scripture
[31:15] my goodness one thing i've learned is
[31:17] human beings are pathetic creatures
[31:20] god help us and save us
[31:22] fill us with your spirit lord because
[31:25] the spirit of man is so corrupt and so
[31:27] polluted human beings are pathetic
[31:32] jesus says to a group of pharisees in
[31:34] mark chapter 2 he says the sabbath was
[31:37] made for man
[31:38] not man for the sabbath
[31:41] they got so twisted up and they didn't
[31:43] realize that god had created a sabbath
[31:45] now remember the sabbath was outside the
[31:47] law it was part of the ten commandments
[31:49] the ten commandments were not the law
[31:51] the ten commandments were a covenant
[31:52] between god and his people and it was
[31:54] going to be a marriage covenant the book
[31:56] of ordinances came after they refused to
[31:58] come up to the mountain
[32:00] so god gave the ten commandments as a
[32:03] marriage covenant as protection and love
[32:05] and instruction for a wife that's how
[32:07] they were given amen and when he gave
[32:10] the commandment for the sabbath amen the
[32:12] sabbath he said remember the sabbath to
[32:13] keep it holy and jesus comes and says
[32:16] this the man was not created to serve
[32:18] the sabbath
[32:20] but sabbath was for the man
[32:23] god had given it to him for rest god had
[32:25] given it to him for reprieve god had
[32:27] given it to him for worship amen but the
[32:29] pharisees had taken the precious word of
[32:32] god and had twisted it until they
[32:34] brought man under bondage
[32:37] and made man to serve the sabbath and
[32:40] said sabbath to serve the man
[32:44] but jesus had the mind of god and with
[32:47] the mind of god he could give him the
[32:49] correct understanding of the sabbath and
[32:52] when he gave him the correct
[32:53] understanding of the sabbath they were
[32:55] filled with madness and had to get rid
[32:56] of him
[32:58] praise be to god
[33:01] some things never change
[33:04] and the message thirst
[33:06] it says because jesus said if we add one
[33:09] word to this or take one word from it
[33:11] our part is taken out of the book of
[33:12] life see not one scripture we must take
[33:15] it just the way it's written and god
[33:16] watches over his word to perform it and
[33:19] we know that it's got to be just right
[33:21] so therefore no matter what a church
[33:23] would say what anybody else would say if
[33:25] you're born of the spirit of god you
[33:27] become part of the bible
[33:30] this is so important you can never
[33:32] understand the bible until you're born
[33:35] of the spirit of god and become the same
[33:36] thing the bible is
[33:38] you become part of the bible and god
[33:40] told ezekiel the prophet he said take
[33:42] the scroll and eat it then the prophet
[33:44] and the scroll become part of each other
[33:46] and that's the believer when he receives
[33:48] the holy spirit the holy spirit wrote
[33:50] the bible and the spirit of god is the
[33:53] word of god
[33:54] you catch that
[33:56] you can't say well i want the spirit and
[33:57] then i'll have the word the spirit and
[33:59] the word are the same thing
[34:02] so the spirit of god is the word of god
[34:04] and so you'll never understand the word
[34:05] of god without the spirit of god
[34:09] he said my words are spirit in the
[34:10] beginning was the word and the word was
[34:12] with god and the word was god and the
[34:14] word was made flesh and one among us
[34:15] hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday
[34:18] today and forever and when you are part
[34:20] of that word and then let something come
[34:22] up contrary to that word now listen what
[34:25] he's saying once you once you've got the
[34:27] baptism of the holy ghost and you fed on
[34:29] the word and you and the word are the
[34:31] same thing he said when you are part of
[34:33] that word and then let something come up
[34:35] contrary to that word
[34:37] there's a little buzzer sets off right
[34:39] quick
[34:40] see and it's to warn you that death is
[34:42] in the road
[34:45] without the spirit of god what will we
[34:47] do
[34:50] use our minds
[34:52] you know i mean that might not have been
[34:54] a scary proposition when i was 20 some
[34:56] years old and i thought i was great
[34:59] but god has allowed time to put a few
[35:01] beat downs
[35:03] some mistakes
[35:04] some falls
[35:06] poor decisions poor poor poor decisions
[35:09] wrong thinking wrong judgments wrong
[35:11] words
[35:12] offenses and contradictions and i've got
[35:15] so many of those things right now amen
[35:17] and i don't know what the next 20 years
[35:19] will hold but i'm to the point now where
[35:21] i do not want to rely on anything that
[35:23] comes from my thinking amen because it's
[35:25] so damaging to me every time i rely on
[35:27] my own thinking i want the mind of god
[35:30] amen you've got to have the spirit of
[35:32] god we've got to get into the same
[35:33] spirit of the composer before we can
[35:35] play our part
[35:37] and we have to there's no way to
[35:38] understand this bible amen without the
[35:41] message and without being in the same
[35:43] spirit the message is in
[35:47] let's go to
[35:48] john chapter 8.
[35:53] i just want to read a few more places
[35:55] and then hopefully keep moving
[35:59] and i just want to say that the thing
[36:01] that i wrote down that i was looking at
[36:03] monday morning
[36:04] is right before i came out to the pulpit
[36:06] i wrote something down really quickly
[36:08] and i wrote down the nature of god is in
[36:11] his word
[36:13] so the nature of god is in his word and
[36:16] i'm talking about his word
[36:18] not man's interpretation of his word but
[36:20] the nature of god because the thought of
[36:23] god is his word and god is his thoughts
[36:28] so god's thought cannot have a different
[36:30] nature than god
[36:32] god
[36:33] this bible says as a man think is in his
[36:35] heart so is he amen god's thoughts are
[36:38] his nature
[36:39] it is his person
[36:41] and so
[36:42] god's the the nature of god is in his
[36:44] word so when god speaks a word it comes
[36:48] from his thought it contains his thought
[36:50] it contains his attributes it contains
[36:52] his nature
[36:55] so the nature of god is in his word the
[36:58] application of his word must carry the
[37:00] same nature
[37:02] so just think about that so the nature
[37:05] of god is in his word the application
[37:08] of the word must carry the same nature
[37:10] so if i take this scripture verse and i
[37:13] apply it with a different nature
[37:17] then it's no longer god's word
[37:22] listen you say what are you talking
[37:23] about you haven't rearranged any of the
[37:25] words you haven't changed any of the
[37:27] black text on the white paper but when
[37:29] it's no longer contains the thought of
[37:31] god but now it has a man's thought and
[37:34] it gets applied according to a man's
[37:36] thinking that is no longer the word of
[37:38] god because you cannot do you cannot
[37:41] attribute what man does with god's word
[37:43] to being god's nature
[37:46] man has done all kinds of things with
[37:48] god's word what they were doing there
[37:50] that day when when when jesus was there
[37:53] on the sabbath day in the synagogue and
[37:55] they would prefer a man stay crippled
[37:57] they prefer a man stays in bondage on
[37:59] the sabbath then the let a man go free
[38:02] on the sabbath why because their hearts
[38:04] were absolutely wicked they were doing
[38:06] something with the word of god that did
[38:08] not contain the nature of god
[38:10] so you can no longer call that the word
[38:12] of god but they can quote to you
[38:14] verbatim what moses said but jesus is
[38:17] looking at him and saying you don't even
[38:19] know god i know him you don't know him
[38:23] amen
[38:24] amen
[38:27] oh praise god
[38:29] john chapter 8 verse 3.
[38:33] and the scribes and the pharisees
[38:34] brought unto him a woman taken in
[38:36] adultery referred to this sunday
[38:38] and when they had set her in the midst
[38:41] they say unto him master this woman was
[38:43] taken in adultery in the very act
[38:46] now moses and the law commanded us that
[38:48] such should be stoned but what sayest
[38:51] thou
[38:53] oh
[38:55] oh
[38:56] they thought they had him
[38:59] caught a woman in the very act of
[39:01] adultery
[39:03] caught her red-handed
[39:06] brought her to jesus and quoted the
[39:09] scriptures
[39:11] the law of moses said she ought to be
[39:12] stoned what do you say
[39:16] basically are you going to contradict
[39:18] moses
[39:20] and when we when we see the story unfold
[39:24] jesus wasn't the one contradicting moses
[39:26] the ones who were quoting moses were the
[39:28] ones contradicting moses
[39:32] they were quoting moses and
[39:34] contradicting moses
[39:39] amen
[39:40] let's keep reading
[39:42] he said the master this woman was taken
[39:44] in adultery the very act now moses and
[39:46] the law commanded us that such should be
[39:47] stoned but what say us down
[39:51] uh
[39:54] verse six this they said tempting him
[39:56] tempting him that they might have to
[39:58] accuse him
[40:01] they had no desire to keep the law
[40:06] they were using the word to contradict
[40:11] they were using i said let me be careful
[40:13] in how i word this they were using the
[40:15] scripture to contradict the manifested
[40:17] word
[40:20] listen when somebody tries to use a
[40:22] scripture against the message
[40:27] when somebody tries to use a scripture
[40:29] to contradict something brother brenham
[40:31] taught
[40:34] i want to ask you where did that spirit
[40:36] come from
[40:39] but they have the scripture but it
[40:41] doesn't mean they have the word to have
[40:42] the word you have to have the thought
[40:49] praise god
[40:54] this they said tempting him
[40:56] that they might have to accuse him
[40:58] but jesus stooped down and with his
[41:00] finger wrote on the ground and as though
[41:02] he heard them not
[41:04] so when they continued asking him he
[41:06] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[41:08] that is without sin among you let him
[41:10] first cast a stone at her
[41:13] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[41:15] the ground
[41:16] and they walk and and they which heard
[41:18] it being convicted by their own
[41:20] conscience went out one by one
[41:22] beginning at the oldest even unto the
[41:24] last and jesus was left alone and the
[41:27] woman standing in in the midst and when
[41:29] jesus had lifted up himself and saw none
[41:31] but the woman he said unto her woman
[41:33] where where are those thine accusers
[41:35] have no man condemned thee she said no
[41:38] man lord and jesus said unto her neither
[41:40] do i condemn thee go and sin no more
[41:45] see
[41:46] in order for them
[41:48] to have a proper application of this
[41:51] word of moses
[41:52] they have to have the nature of the word
[41:56] the proper application of the word will
[41:58] always carry the nature of the word and
[42:00] so now they're looking for an
[42:02] application of the word but they do not
[42:04] have the nature of god in this
[42:06] application they're using it to trip up
[42:09] or trap or contradict the manifested
[42:11] word
[42:13] and then they care nothing about keeping
[42:15] the law all they care about is
[42:17] contradicting jesus christ
[42:20] and then they care nothing about this
[42:22] woman or the purity in israel or
[42:25] are the perfection in the camp they care
[42:27] nothing about the things that that law
[42:30] was written about
[42:32] they don't care about keeping the camp
[42:34] clean that's not what they're interested
[42:36] in they're only interested in
[42:37] manipulating that scripture for their
[42:39] own purpose
[42:42] and then they don't even apply the
[42:44] scripture correctly because the
[42:46] scripture says amen if they're caught in
[42:48] adultery the man and the woman are to be
[42:50] stoned but there's no man present but
[42:52] they knew the man because they caught
[42:54] her in the very act of adultery
[42:57] right
[42:58] so now they're trying to apply the
[43:01] justice of god
[43:03] without the righteousness of god
[43:06] because they were not acting righteously
[43:09] because they knew better
[43:11] they knew this was a setup they knew
[43:13] this was not true they knew that the man
[43:16] should have been brought and he was left
[43:17] out they knew all of the they knew that
[43:20] they were wrong according to the word so
[43:22] they were trying to get justice without
[43:24] righteousness but god's justice is never
[43:27] absent of his righteousness
[43:30] so in order to find the right
[43:31] application for the word you have to
[43:34] have the right nature the right
[43:36] application of the word will carry the
[43:38] right nature of the word
[43:40] so jesus knew the word
[43:43] jesus never contradicted the word they
[43:45] never said you're not quoting the
[43:47] scriptures they never said moses never
[43:49] said that amen he just he just put a
[43:52] challenge to them you that are without
[43:54] sin cast the first stone they all walked
[43:56] away because jesus is the master of the
[43:58] word he is the manifested word he has
[44:00] the mind of god amen he is the
[44:03] revelation of god and he's standing
[44:05] there and he looks at the woman he says
[44:06] woman where are thine accusers perfect
[44:09] question because nobody can be stoned
[44:11] without the witness of two or three
[44:15] so he says where are thine accusers she
[44:17] says i have none he said neither do i
[44:19] accuse you
[44:22] and she could never be stoned on the
[44:24] accusations of one alone anyways
[44:26] had to be two or three
[44:28] he said neither do i accuse you listen
[44:30] to what he says
[44:31] go
[44:32] and sin
[44:33] no
[44:34] more he knew
[44:37] she was sinning
[44:39] but he could stay true to the law
[44:43] he could stay true to the nature of god
[44:46] and he could send this woman away with
[44:47] an admonition go and sin no more because
[44:50] he knew that what they were asking for
[44:53] was part of the word of god without all
[44:55] of the word of god
[44:58] see
[44:59] there may be things that we don't
[45:01] understand in the message there may be
[45:02] things that maybe don't compute into our
[45:05] mind and we haven't been able to figure
[45:07] out where brother branham got that in
[45:08] the scriptures or why he says it that
[45:10] way but when the entire amen revelation
[45:13] of the word was given out amen now when
[45:16] brother branham is preaching the
[45:17] scriptures he's taking the entirety of
[45:20] the word into play amen it's like jesus
[45:23] christ standing there he has the full
[45:25] mind of god the full word of god and
[45:27] they bring a part of the scripture but
[45:28] he's got all of the scripture
[45:32] of the nature all of the thought all of
[45:34] the mind to apply and he has the perfect
[45:37] correct application of the word
[45:41] so the prophet of god now amen he's been
[45:43] called into a special position and he's
[45:46] been he's been given a revelation of the
[45:48] scriptures of revelation he has the mind
[45:51] of christ and now he's bringing the word
[45:53] but he's not bringing the word with a
[45:55] partial understanding like in luther's
[45:57] day or a partial understanding in
[45:59] wesley's day this is no longer a partial
[46:01] application of the word but now we've
[46:03] got the full measure of the word and god
[46:05] has given to us amen the fullness of the
[46:07] word and the prophet when he's teaching
[46:09] something he knows the author real well
[46:14] so those things we don't understand
[46:16] they're not things to throw away they're
[46:18] not things to contradict they're things
[46:20] to say i trust
[46:24] i trust the mechanism that god has used
[46:26] to bring me instruction in this day
[46:28] i trust that voice i trust that gift i
[46:32] trust god
[46:35] i trust god that if that prophet was
[46:37] wrong that prophet would have corrected
[46:38] himself
[46:42] because i trust god to give me a true
[46:44] voice
[46:45] [Music]
[46:46] i trust god amen to give a gift that
[46:50] won't steer me in the wrong direction
[46:52] and won't give me wrong scriptures and
[46:54] won't give his opinion as law
[46:59] the real question is do we trust what
[47:01] god's given us or not
[47:04] [Music]
[47:10] i don't know i can't really explain
[47:13] why this is so heavy on my heart but
[47:15] it's become so heavy on my heart
[47:18] that we cannot pick and choose
[47:21] out of the message we cannot do what
[47:23] every age has done before or we will
[47:25] wind up like every age has wound up
[47:27] before
[47:28] but there's prophesied a predestinated
[47:30] bride that it will not go that way but
[47:32] don't you think there's not a devil
[47:34] trying to pull the same tactics he's
[47:36] done in every age trying to do it to you
[47:38] and i today
[47:40] if he could tempt jesus in the
[47:41] wilderness he could come to you with
[47:43] scriptures with examples with story and
[47:46] try to get a deviation off the word in
[47:48] our lives like he was trying to do with
[47:50] jesus christ that day who was the
[47:52] manifested word well what is the bride
[47:54] for this day she is the manifested word
[47:56] where is the devil's attack come to the
[47:58] manifested word what's he attacking he's
[48:00] using the very word that she's here to
[48:03] manifest to try to deviate her off the
[48:05] word
[48:07] and for some reason i can't explain why
[48:09] other than a burden i am so burdened
[48:12] with this to say you know god i do not
[48:15] want any of my thinking i'm so tired of
[48:17] my own thinking tired of my own
[48:19] explanations and tired of everybody
[48:21] else's explanations
[48:23] i want your spirit amen to give me that
[48:26] little buzzer on the inside and i want
[48:28] to stick with the gift that you sent in
[48:30] this day to bring your mind the mind of
[48:32] the author has come through this message
[48:35] and i'm not about to say well brother
[48:37] branham was wrong on that and he was
[48:38] wrong on that and that was his opinion
[48:40] and i'm not about to go there friends if
[48:42] i don't understand it i have no problem
[48:44] saying i don't understand what he's
[48:45] saying but i am not going to say that he
[48:47] is teaching that wrong or else i'm
[48:49] saying that god sent me a vessel that i
[48:52] can't trust to teach the word correctly
[48:55] [Music]
[48:58] and now i've got to rely on what i think
[49:03] or the scriptures that i can find
[49:07] but the real problem with that is
[49:09] as time goes on i keep finding more
[49:12] scriptures that vindicate what brother
[49:14] better taught that i never knew were in
[49:15] the bible
[49:17] so why would i discount something he
[49:19] teaches now because i can't find the
[49:21] scriptures in the bible when all along
[49:23] the way i'm constantly finding more
[49:25] scriptures in the bible that vindicate
[49:27] what he taught and i didn't know those
[49:29] scriptures were in the bible
[49:31] so if i would say what brother i'm
[49:33] taught there is not in the bible what
[49:35] i'm saying is i know the bible better
[49:37] than the prophet of god
[49:43] none of us would stand up and say that
[49:46] no i i know the bible better but if you
[49:49] say brother brown taught that and that's
[49:50] nowhere in the bible
[49:55] then why did he teach it
[49:57] why did he teach it as a concept of god
[49:59] why did he teach it as part of god's
[50:00] nature why did he teach it as relevant
[50:02] to the message today why did he repeat
[50:04] it multiple times if it's not if it's
[50:07] not relevant if it's not something
[50:12] see see how dangerous this becomes
[50:16] we say well this is a little issue but
[50:18] there's all kinds of issues
[50:20] and this becomes extremely extremely
[50:23] dangerous when we begin to go down these
[50:25] paths
[50:28] i'd rather come back to the path as i
[50:30] trust
[50:31] i trust
[50:33] the gift that god placed and i trust the
[50:35] office of a prophet and i trust that and
[50:37] i'm when i say i'm trusting that i'm
[50:39] trusting god who vindicated that
[50:42] god would not have thoroughly vindicated
[50:44] something and left me in error on part
[50:47] of the word
[50:48] unless he would have come and fixed it
[50:54] let's look at matthew 23.
[50:58] i'm not getting very far in my notes
[51:02] but i hope that you're catching my
[51:04] burden
[51:05] and i hope you also understand
[51:08] what i'm saying because there's
[51:10] absolutely nothing legalistic in what
[51:12] i'm saying
[51:14] because it's not about
[51:16] strict adherence to something for the
[51:18] sake of being saved
[51:21] it's about a respect for an office god
[51:23] placed
[51:25] it's about understanding god was the one
[51:27] who backed this man up god was the one
[51:29] who proved and vindicated over and over
[51:32] again that this is my mouthpiece brother
[51:34] bennett in one message he says i am the
[51:36] mouthpiece of god to you or i am the
[51:38] voice of god to you
[51:40] he stops he said i didn't say that he
[51:42] said that
[51:43] amen
[51:47] what i'm saying is having respect for
[51:49] that
[51:52] matthew 23 23
[51:55] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[51:56] hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[51:59] anise and cumin and have omitted the
[52:01] weightier matters of the law judgment
[52:03] mercy and faith
[52:05] these ought to you you to these ought ye
[52:08] to have done and not to leave the other
[52:11] undone
[52:15] jesus says you
[52:16] caught you caught the surface
[52:22] you caught the tithing you caught this
[52:25] but you missed judgment mercy and faith
[52:28] judgment mercy and faith was not laying
[52:30] on the surface judgment and mercy and
[52:32] faith was the nature behind the
[52:34] instructions
[52:36] because the instructions showed god's
[52:38] judgment the instructions showed god's
[52:40] mercy the instructions give you faith in
[52:43] the word of god those were laying those
[52:45] were contained within the instructions
[52:47] they were deeper than the surface they
[52:49] got the surface i got to pay tithe of
[52:51] this i got to do this and i got to do
[52:52] that and i dressed this way and i look
[52:54] this way and i do this and if i do all
[52:56] of that but they missed the very nature
[52:58] of god that was coming through because
[53:00] paul says the law was not flawed paul
[53:02] said the law was perfect
[53:04] because it's part of the word and it's
[53:06] part of god the flaw was mankind to keep
[53:08] the law it wasn't the problem with the
[53:09] law
[53:12] so it contained the very nature of god
[53:16] judgment and mercy and faith and they
[53:18] missed the deeper things and caught the
[53:20] surface
[53:24] jesus he talked he tells them the spirit
[53:27] it's the spirit that quickeneth the
[53:28] flesh prophet of nothing the words that
[53:30] i speak unto you they are spirit and
[53:33] they are life
[53:34] they're more than just instructions the
[53:37] words they also contain the spirit and
[53:39] the life when they contain the thought
[53:40] of god because god's thoughts are
[53:43] eternal
[53:46] so they contain the lies
[53:49] now i'd like to
[53:51] share a few quotes here referring to the
[53:53] ministry of brother branham
[53:55] he says in the message spiritual food
[53:57] and due season so we find out that when
[53:59] a man comes sent from god ordained of
[54:01] god with the truth thus saith the lord
[54:03] the message and the messenger are one
[54:06] and the same
[54:08] because he is sent to represent thus
[54:10] saith the lord word by word so he and
[54:14] his message is the same
[54:16] i just want you to lock that in that the
[54:18] message and the messenger are one and
[54:20] the same that he came to represent thus
[54:23] saith the lord word by word so he and
[54:25] his message is the same
[54:28] i want you to hold on to that i want to
[54:29] read a couple other quotes and come back
[54:30] to this
[54:32] the word of god says in hebrews the
[54:34] fourth fourth chapter he says the word
[54:36] of god is more powerful and sharper than
[54:38] a two-edged sword cutting to the asunder
[54:39] of the morrow of the bone and a
[54:41] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[54:43] the harm
[54:44] it's the word and every time that a
[54:46] prophet came he come with the word and
[54:49] he was the word for that age
[54:53] he caught that
[54:54] god is his own interpreter 1964.
[54:58] so he come with the word and he was the
[55:01] word for that age who the messenger the
[55:03] prophet he become the word for that age
[55:08] and the feast of trumpets he said look i
[55:10] want to say one more thing closely now
[55:12] don't miss this how striking from the
[55:14] seventh angels
[55:17] message but he injects a statement it's
[55:19] in it's in parentheses here he's saying
[55:21] that the sentence reads like this uh
[55:23] look i want to say one more thing
[55:24] closely now don't miss this how striking
[55:27] from the seventh angel's message but he
[55:29] injects something in the sentence and he
[55:31] says messenger of the seventh seal
[55:36] okay
[55:37] uh
[55:38] if you could turn the white board on for
[55:39] me i want to write down something so he
[55:42] injects this messenger of the seventh
[55:43] seal message in revelation 10 was the
[55:46] seventh seal to the seventh trumpet
[55:47] between those two times so he's
[55:49] explaining something else but he injects
[55:50] the statement in the sentence the
[55:52] messenger of the seventh seal
[55:54] so brother branham says
[55:56] that
[55:59] the seventh
[56:01] angel
[56:04] is the messenger
[56:10] of
[56:12] the seventh
[56:15] is seal what he says
[56:18] then he says
[56:21] the messenger
[56:23] am i spelling that right
[56:25] i don't care
[56:27] the messenger
[56:30] and his message
[56:35] is
[56:36] one
[56:37] and
[56:39] the same
[56:43] so what's he telling us
[56:46] if you want to see the seventh seal look
[56:48] at the messenger
[56:52] he's the messenger of the seventh seal
[56:55] because his message was not tying
[56:57] together the loose ends his message was
[56:59] revelation 10 1-7
[57:01] the seven thunders he was he was the
[57:04] messenger of the seventh seal
[57:06] and the messenger and his message are
[57:08] one in the same
[57:20] praise god
[57:23] and the message is the masterpiece he
[57:25] says
[57:28] now what did he say in revelation 10
[57:29] that would take place why was the trip
[57:31] to tucson to open the church open to the
[57:33] church in the days of the messenger of
[57:35] the seventh angel the seventh angel
[57:37] message the whole word of god would be
[57:40] made manifest
[57:42] the seal that what all the stalk has
[57:44] left off of what all about it would be
[57:46] made manifest in this time
[57:48] so what was revelation 10 to do
[57:51] the whole word of god would be made
[57:52] manifest
[57:54] in the message of guide from 1962 he
[57:56] says that's the reason the coming of the
[57:58] of the seals at the finishing of the
[58:01] seventh seal the mystery of god should
[58:02] be finished to know who god is
[58:05] what he is how he lives his nature his
[58:09] being
[58:12] so what was the what was the
[58:14] coming of the seals the finishing of the
[58:16] seventh seal this is this is revelation
[58:19] 10 7.
[58:21] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[58:22] mystery of god should be finished to
[58:24] know who god is
[58:26] what he is how he lives
[58:30] how he lives
[58:32] his nature
[58:35] his being
[58:38] the seventh seal didn't come for
[58:39] information
[58:42] the seventh seal was not given to us in
[58:44] information
[58:45] the seventh seal was given to us in
[58:47] demonstration
[58:48] [Music]
[58:52] i'd like to say
[58:53] this way
[58:56] if you go onto youtube and you watch
[58:58] testimonies of brother branham
[59:00] and there's a myriad of people who were
[59:02] with the prophet spent a lot of time
[59:04] with them hunting buddies minister
[59:05] friends
[59:06] people witness church all kinds family
[59:09] members all kinds of people give
[59:10] testimonies
[59:12] and you can go in there and listen to
[59:13] them which i thoroughly enjoyed doing i
[59:15] listen i love listening to the life of
[59:17] the prophet like i love listening to the
[59:18] tapes when he's telling his stories when
[59:20] he's explaining his experiences with god
[59:22] all of these things listen there's a
[59:24] reason we've got all these tapes
[59:27] there's a reason we got all these tapes
[59:30] and we don't just have little segments
[59:32] but we've got the whole picture
[59:34] there's reasons why this man's life is
[59:36] on display
[59:38] there's a reason why it came in this day
[59:40] when his life could be recorded his
[59:41] voice could be recorded his stories his
[59:43] mistakes his repentance his experiences
[59:45] with god on the mountaintop i mean his
[59:47] experience is a
[59:49] businessman fellowships with ministers
[59:51] with friends with his wife amen there's
[59:52] a reason all that's on display amen
[59:55] because at the end of the seventh seal
[59:57] amen we're going to know how god lives
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:03] we're going to know his nature amen
[1:00:05] we're going to know what god is like
[1:00:07] what the manifestation of god is
[1:00:08] supposed to be in this hour
[1:00:11] and so if you look at all these
[1:00:13] testimonies
[1:00:14] and you look at the doctrinal
[1:00:16] differences in the people who are
[1:00:17] sharing the testimonies you'll have
[1:00:19] somebody who will give a testimony that
[1:00:21] doesn't believe the seventh seal is open
[1:00:24] you have somebody else that will share a
[1:00:25] testimony that doesn't believe brother
[1:00:26] bear is the fulfillment of revelation 10
[1:00:29] 7.
[1:00:29] you have somebody else who will give a
[1:00:31] testimony that doesn't believe in
[1:00:33] fightful ministry should only listen to
[1:00:34] tapes
[1:00:35] you have somebody else that will share a
[1:00:37] testimony amen that believes that
[1:00:38] brother venom has to come back in a
[1:00:40] return ministry to fix everything
[1:00:42] right and i'm not contradicting him i'm
[1:00:44] not saying if they're right or wrong i'm
[1:00:45] just saying these are the different
[1:00:47] different doctrines that the people
[1:00:49] believe you have some people who believe
[1:00:51] that the seals are open and brother
[1:00:52] branham was fulfilling malachi 4 and
[1:00:54] revelation 10 7.
[1:00:56] you have all of these doctrinal
[1:00:58] differences when it comes to believing
[1:01:00] the doctrine of the message these
[1:01:02] individuals are as far apart as east is
[1:01:05] from west they cannot agree on the
[1:01:08] doctrine of the message but if you
[1:01:10] listen to every one of their testimonies
[1:01:12] when they describe the life of that man
[1:01:15] their testimonies all line up like this
[1:01:17] and they give the exact same testimony
[1:01:20] of the life that man lived
[1:01:24] i don't think that is coincidence
[1:01:29] you have somebody who will even question
[1:01:32] whether he's not he's revelation 10 7
[1:01:34] but they'll give the seven testimony of
[1:01:36] his life
[1:01:38] somebody who believes he's got to come
[1:01:39] and return and and finish the message
[1:01:42] he'll give the same testimony you have
[1:01:43] somebody who believes he's already done
[1:01:44] it all and won't return same testimony
[1:01:46] somebody who believes in fightful
[1:01:47] ministry same testimony somebody who
[1:01:49] doesn't believe in fightful ministry
[1:01:50] same testimony
[1:01:53] because the man's life was the
[1:01:55] reflection of jesus christ in flesh
[1:01:59] and his life did not deviate with who w
[1:02:02] with from with whom he was spending time
[1:02:05] with
[1:02:06] you don't get a separate testimony from
[1:02:08] his son that you do from his hunting
[1:02:10] partner
[1:02:12] you don't get a separate testimony from
[1:02:14] his hunting buddy that you do with his
[1:02:16] minister friend
[1:02:18] you don't get a different testimony from
[1:02:20] his wife that you do from those that
[1:02:22] were with him in alaska hunting
[1:02:25] you get the same testimony of the same
[1:02:28] character the same nature the same life
[1:02:31] it all runs true through everybody's
[1:02:33] testimony
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:38] see to me
[1:02:41] brother branham's life is a product of
[1:02:43] his revelation
[1:02:48] and so
[1:02:49] if that man with all the revelation
[1:02:53] you say who's right you know we've got
[1:02:55] this doctrine this doctrine this
[1:02:57] doctrine
[1:02:58] for for me
[1:03:01] i don't really care about being right i
[1:03:04] don't i'm going to say this wrong but i
[1:03:06] don't care about being known for being
[1:03:08] right in my doctrine
[1:03:11] but i want that same life he lived
[1:03:13] because i think that's the purpose of
[1:03:15] the teaching
[1:03:17] i think that's the purpose of the
[1:03:18] opening of the seals i think that was
[1:03:20] the purpose of the return of the word to
[1:03:22] bring the full life of jesus christ back
[1:03:24] into a body of believers so that it can
[1:03:26] be manifest in a living word a living
[1:03:28] attribute of god jesus christ on display
[1:03:31] in flesh is what i think the whole
[1:03:33] purpose of the message was
[1:03:36] so all those testimonies of his life is
[1:03:38] demonstrating the purpose of the message
[1:03:44] so that means for me
[1:03:46] all the doctrine i believe
[1:03:49] i want to line up to that life
[1:03:52] and if i believe a doctrine that moves
[1:03:55] me over here i want to reject that
[1:03:57] doctrine
[1:03:59] because i want the doctrine that pulls
[1:04:01] me in line with this life because this
[1:04:03] life is the display of jesus christ in
[1:04:05] flesh
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:09] remember
[1:04:10] brother bam told us that on the plains
[1:04:12] of memory
[1:04:13] it was elohim god himself that stepped
[1:04:16] into human flesh to tell sarah the what
[1:04:18] the secret of her heart and the tent
[1:04:20] behind her
[1:04:21] and then after he would explain that in
[1:04:23] the sermon he would turn us back to the
[1:04:25] crowd and he would begin to share what's
[1:04:27] in the heart of some individuals in the
[1:04:29] audience behind him showing that the
[1:04:32] same thing that was on the plains of
[1:04:33] memory is here now what is that elohim
[1:04:36] god himself in a human body amen i mean
[1:04:41] tell me who else has done that
[1:04:44] where else have you seen that who else
[1:04:47] can say such things
[1:04:52] you remember
[1:04:53] dawson reilly's testimony
[1:04:56] and he says brother ben was talking to
[1:04:57] him one day and said you know up in
[1:04:59] canada he said they're baptizing in my
[1:05:01] name and it was really troubling brother
[1:05:02] branham
[1:05:03] and dawson riley riley he was like wow
[1:05:06] how can they do that and he didn't say
[1:05:08] anything but he was just thinking
[1:05:10] and brother branham looked over at
[1:05:11] dawson said they're not as far off as
[1:05:13] you think
[1:05:18] and dawson said i thought that was
[1:05:20] pretty far off
[1:05:23] because it was a son of man revealing
[1:05:25] the son of man the son of man was there
[1:05:31] and the son of man was working in that
[1:05:33] flesh
[1:05:35] elohim was coming into that flesh and
[1:05:36] discerning the thoughts of people's
[1:05:38] minds
[1:05:40] but that flesh was not elohim
[1:05:44] brother branham says it's a razor's edge
[1:05:47] between what's true and what's wrong
[1:05:50] he said they're baptizing in my name and
[1:05:52] boy that's horrible and he says they're
[1:05:54] not as far off as you think dawson
[1:06:00] because it was a son of man revealing
[1:06:02] the son of man
[1:06:05] jesus christ was displaying himself
[1:06:09] in that tabernacle
[1:06:11] he was showing his nature
[1:06:13] his attributes
[1:06:15] he was lining the word up and showing
[1:06:18] what it looked like
[1:06:20] what what the word looked like when it
[1:06:22] was displayed
[1:06:24] in sin born flesh
[1:06:32] see
[1:06:33] i said something sunday i'd like to
[1:06:35] repeat
[1:06:37] god did not send down the message
[1:06:40] in books
[1:06:42] and just flutter down from heaven all
[1:06:44] the books
[1:06:46] because if he would flutter down all the
[1:06:48] books from heaven we would just be
[1:06:50] arguing about this and that but what god
[1:06:53] did is he took the message and he put it
[1:06:55] on display in a human being
[1:06:58] so that we could take what's on the book
[1:07:00] and line it up to the lies and that
[1:07:03] these things must line up
[1:07:05] and so how can i say i have the correct
[1:07:08] doctrine of the message and i hate my
[1:07:10] brother and i'm antagonistic and i'm
[1:07:12] nasty in the pulpit and sarcastic and
[1:07:14] cutting everybody else down and calling
[1:07:16] them names and
[1:07:18] when the example of that doctrine
[1:07:20] interpreted never did those things
[1:07:24] so how can i do those things and say i
[1:07:27] believe the correct doctrine when the
[1:07:28] one who who received the correct
[1:07:30] teaching never did those things
[1:07:35] so
[1:07:36] it gives us a great opportunity to check
[1:07:40] what we believe with a living example
[1:07:43] a living example we have testimonies we
[1:07:46] have recorded sermons we have his own
[1:07:49] testimony we've got other books a man
[1:07:51] sent from god 20th century prophet a
[1:07:54] prophet visits south africa we have all
[1:07:56] kinds of examples amen all kinds of
[1:07:59] books that were written tapes that we
[1:08:00] can listen to recorded testimonies to
[1:08:03] show us this man's life and they all
[1:08:05] line up to paint the same picture and i
[1:08:07] want to believe a message amen that has
[1:08:10] the same spirit that was in that man
[1:08:12] that brought him to that life i want
[1:08:14] that same word and that same spirit to
[1:08:16] bring my life to match that life
[1:08:20] and i'm not saying i want to i don't i
[1:08:22] don't want to have to repeat all the
[1:08:24] works that he did i'm not called to be a
[1:08:25] prophet that's not my office but i want
[1:08:27] that character i want that nature i want
[1:08:29] that life inside of me
[1:08:36] so the finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:08:38] mystery of god should be finished to
[1:08:40] know who god is what he is how he lives
[1:08:43] his nature and his being
[1:08:47] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:08:49] sun brother man says as christ was the
[1:08:51] first one to raise from all the prophets
[1:08:53] and so forth although typed in many
[1:08:55] places he was the first fruits of those
[1:08:57] that slept in the bride coming of christ
[1:09:00] coming out of the church they'll have to
[1:09:01] be a sheaf waved again in the last days
[1:09:04] waving of the sheep what was the sheaf
[1:09:06] the first one that come to mature the
[1:09:10] first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:09:13] so the per first part of the field
[1:09:16] the the bride field
[1:09:18] that came to full harvest maturity there
[1:09:20] was a maturing of the word and as it
[1:09:22] matured it matured in a vessel amen and
[1:09:24] that word was lifted up and weighed
[1:09:26] before us what was the wave sheath it
[1:09:28] was the first one to prove that it was
[1:09:30] wheat
[1:09:32] how do you prove that you're wheat
[1:09:34] brother branham said you don't yeah he
[1:09:36] told us you don't do it in the shuck
[1:09:37] phase the tassel phase the blade face
[1:09:39] but it's got to come back to wheat to
[1:09:41] reflect the original wheat that went in
[1:09:43] the ground so whatever life went into
[1:09:45] the ground amen jesus christ when the
[1:09:48] seed went in has to be the same seed at
[1:09:50] the end so there had to be a wave sheep
[1:09:52] that was waved over the people
[1:09:54] the first one that proved it was wheat
[1:09:56] what wheat the same wheat that went in
[1:09:59] the ground the life of jesus christ this
[1:10:02] way she was the first one to prove it
[1:10:04] was wheat
[1:10:05] not barley not oats but wheat
[1:10:10] and i want to ask you did his life prove
[1:10:12] that he was wheat
[1:10:15] did the process bring him to full
[1:10:17] harvest maturity
[1:10:19] did you see the life of jesus christ on
[1:10:21] display
[1:10:24] you realize that that did not happen for
[1:10:27] his benefit that happened for our
[1:10:30] benefit
[1:10:31] god did that for us friends
[1:10:36] oh praise be to god
[1:10:39] he goes on to say the first one that
[1:10:40] proved it was wheat that proved it was a
[1:10:42] sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what
[1:10:45] i'm talking about it was waved over the
[1:10:47] people and the first time there will
[1:10:49] come forth for the bright age for a
[1:10:51] resurrection out of dark
[1:10:53] denominationalism will be a message
[1:10:56] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:10:58] turned back again in its full power and
[1:11:01] being waved over the people by the same
[1:11:03] signs and wonders that he did back there
[1:11:07] so god waved this message amen how did
[1:11:10] he wave the message the message and the
[1:11:12] messenger are the one in the same thing
[1:11:16] what was his message the seventh seal
[1:11:18] what life did he display the seventh
[1:11:20] seal
[1:11:22] it was christ in bride form was being
[1:11:25] waived over you and i
[1:11:27] what does it look like when christ is in
[1:11:29] bright form look at that prophet that's
[1:11:31] what it looks like what is my goal what
[1:11:33] is my objective what is this message
[1:11:35] pointing to it's pointing to what is
[1:11:37] this message for amen is to bring cre to
[1:11:40] being christ in bright form what does it
[1:11:42] look like when jesus christ is in the
[1:11:44] formation of the bride it looks like
[1:11:46] that prophet right there he was the
[1:11:47] first one to prove that he was we
[1:11:50] showing that the process that brought
[1:11:52] this one that we will bring the entire
[1:11:54] harvest to wheat
[1:11:55] of wheat to maturity so whatever worked
[1:11:57] for him and then what brother branham
[1:11:59] say he said you know what we have to do
[1:12:01] now there's nothing wrong with the
[1:12:03] message but we just got to lay in the
[1:12:04] presence of the sun to bake all of the
[1:12:07] greenness out so that we can come to the
[1:12:09] same so what was sent this message was
[1:12:12] the light and brother benham said hot
[1:12:14] august light amen it was to bake all of
[1:12:17] the greenness out of us so this message
[1:12:19] that came to us was to bring us the full
[1:12:22] harvest maturity and full harvest
[1:12:24] maturity will look like that wave sheath
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:30] and so
[1:12:31] you know i'm ashamed to admit to you
[1:12:34] there's still some greenness left in
[1:12:36] chad
[1:12:37] how do you know brother chad because i'm
[1:12:38] looking at the wave sheath
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:41] and when i look at the wave sheath i
[1:12:43] can't say well i'm all ready
[1:12:46] when i look at the wave sheath i said oh
[1:12:48] i need to lay in the presence of this
[1:12:50] message
[1:12:51] i need to lay in this sun this light
[1:12:53] this illumination amen this presence of
[1:12:56] jesus christ at the return of his word i
[1:12:58] need that to continue to bake all the
[1:13:00] immaturity out of me so i can come into
[1:13:03] that same image
[1:13:05] now remember don't get confused in your
[1:13:07] mind when we say same image it's not
[1:13:09] same office and all the same works amen
[1:13:12] you don't have to raise the dead and
[1:13:14] open the blind of the eyes that will
[1:13:15] happen in the body of christ absolutely
[1:13:17] but it doesn't mean you have to repeat
[1:13:19] what the prophet did it's the life it's
[1:13:21] the nature amen it's the very life of
[1:13:24] christ coming through your life and it
[1:13:26] doesn't matter if there's ever a
[1:13:28] manifestation of a supernatural power
[1:13:30] that other people can look and say she
[1:13:32] raised dead sheep and blind eyes but
[1:13:34] it's the life that's laying there
[1:13:39] and if the life is there it can raise
[1:13:41] dead and open blind eyes it can do
[1:13:42] whatever the life wants to
[1:13:44] do but we want that life
[1:13:49] in the smyrnan church age
[1:13:52] out of the church age book brother bram
[1:13:53] said in every age
[1:13:55] every age is the age of the holy ghost
[1:13:57] for the true believer
[1:13:59] in every age the evidence was the same
[1:14:00] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:14:02] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:14:04] took the word and taught it revealed it
[1:14:06] to them
[1:14:08] and they were of the group that heard
[1:14:10] the messenger and his message and took
[1:14:13] it and lived it
[1:14:16] now listen brother bram said something a
[1:14:18] little different this time he didn't say
[1:14:20] took it and believed it believed it
[1:14:21] accepted it he said they took it and
[1:14:23] they lived that messenger's message
[1:14:29] in the message the invisible union
[1:14:32] brother bam says
[1:14:34] the anointed word of god being
[1:14:36] vindicated before any man that's born to
[1:14:38] be a son of god with the predestinated
[1:14:40] germ into him for this hour he'll see
[1:14:43] god's message as sure as there's a god
[1:14:45] in heaven martin luther saw it for his
[1:14:47] wesley salt for his the pentecostal
[1:14:49] sought for his now what about you see
[1:14:52] they went into a denomination here's the
[1:14:54] word condemning it telling you what we
[1:14:56] are to have today
[1:14:58] and just exactly malachi 4 and all these
[1:15:00] other promises for the hour what do you
[1:15:02] see what are you looking at
[1:15:05] amen here we are the real genuine eagles
[1:15:08] here my sheep know my voice the stranger
[1:15:11] they'll not follow why it was put in
[1:15:14] there by predestination you were
[1:15:16] foreordained to be a son of god you were
[1:15:19] in god before the foundation of the
[1:15:20] world you're only manifested in this day
[1:15:23] for his honor and glory
[1:15:26] how can you do it without honoring his
[1:15:28] word
[1:15:30] and stand with every word of god yes sir
[1:15:32] which you are a part of that word by
[1:15:36] predestination because look god is the
[1:15:38] word you believe it
[1:15:40] he always was the word in the beginning
[1:15:42] was the word and if the word was god
[1:15:44] then you were in god
[1:15:47] the word
[1:15:48] the part that you're to play was in god
[1:15:51] before the foundation of the world he
[1:15:53] seen you he knew you he predestinated
[1:15:56] you to it
[1:16:00] so the seventh angel was the messenger
[1:16:02] of the seventh seal i hope we have this
[1:16:04] and the messenger in his message is one
[1:16:06] and the same
[1:16:10] see
[1:16:15] sometimes i get cautious about the way i
[1:16:17] word things because i don't want people
[1:16:19] to take what i'm saying and run in a
[1:16:20] different direction with it but i i hope
[1:16:22] you're catching my heart my intent and
[1:16:23] what i'm saying
[1:16:25] but people have been looking for years
[1:16:29] into the message books to try to find
[1:16:32] the seventh seal
[1:16:37] when the seventh seal has been on
[1:16:39] display the whole time
[1:16:43] that's why brother branham when he's
[1:16:44] preaching the seals he goes through
[1:16:46] seals and seal one information seal two
[1:16:49] information steal three seal four seal
[1:16:50] five still six it's all information
[1:16:52] information information but when you get
[1:16:54] to seal seven there's no information
[1:16:58] he says there's silence nothing's said
[1:17:00] there's not even a symbol to go on
[1:17:02] nothing's give out in this amen and
[1:17:04] brother branham said it's the coming of
[1:17:06] the lord
[1:17:15] so is the seventh seal open
[1:17:18] brother bram said it's the coming of the
[1:17:19] lord is the seventh seal open no it's
[1:17:21] not open
[1:17:23] well if it's not then we're waiting for
[1:17:24] his coming
[1:17:26] but brother branham said all seven seals
[1:17:28] are open
[1:17:29] but he said the seven seals the coming
[1:17:30] of the lord
[1:17:33] where did he come
[1:17:34] he came in secret
[1:17:37] what's the secret he came in bride form
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:41] where did you see it i saw it in the
[1:17:44] wave sheaves the first part of the bride
[1:17:46] form that come to first i was maturity
[1:17:48] the first part of the church to prove
[1:17:49] that it was wheat was in the messenger
[1:17:53] the messenger amen within the messenger
[1:17:56] was the first part of the harvest to
[1:17:58] come to full harvest maturity and that
[1:18:00] was waved over the people what was it it
[1:18:02] was showing you the seventh seal christ
[1:18:04] in bride form
[1:18:10] so the bride i'm not even writing down i
[1:18:13] don't even remember what i was going to
[1:18:14] write
[1:18:15] the bride
[1:18:17] is the word
[1:18:20] what word is she
[1:18:24] right
[1:18:25] when moses moses was the word
[1:18:28] we believe that
[1:18:30] so there was a thought of god and that
[1:18:33] thought of god amen was spoken and when
[1:18:35] it was spoken it was spoken to abraham
[1:18:38] and there was a promise that the seeds
[1:18:40] have so joined in a strange land but
[1:18:41] i'll bring them out with a mighty hand
[1:18:43] and so there was there was a thought of
[1:18:45] god that became a spoken word of god but
[1:18:47] when moses came down after meeting the
[1:18:49] pillar of fire and he went down as the
[1:18:50] deliverer he was the manifested word
[1:18:55] he was the word for his day he was what
[1:18:57] was in god's mind that was spoken to
[1:18:59] abraham it was thought spoken word
[1:19:02] manifested word and in each expression
[1:19:05] it had to carry the original thought
[1:19:09] so he was the word for that day and that
[1:19:12] day's word was an exodus out of egypt
[1:19:17] you got that
[1:19:18] then joshua became the word for his day
[1:19:22] and joshua's word for his day was a
[1:19:24] crossing over jordan to take the land
[1:19:28] got that
[1:19:29] then david was the word for his day and
[1:19:32] the the david's day was to set up the
[1:19:34] kingdom that the son of david would take
[1:19:36] and rule the entire earth so it came as
[1:19:38] an example of the kingdom of man after
[1:19:40] god's own heart and then solomon became
[1:19:43] the word of his day in solomon's word he
[1:19:46] became the type the foreshadow of jesus
[1:19:48] christ coming as son of david son of god
[1:19:50] prince of peace to establish a reign in
[1:19:52] the millennium that would reign over the
[1:19:54] whole earth so he was there
[1:19:55] foreshadowing that he was playing his
[1:19:57] part for his day so solomon was that
[1:20:00] part joshua was this part david was this
[1:20:03] part amen moses was this part and what
[1:20:05] were they they were the word and when
[1:20:07] they were there acting out the word they
[1:20:09] were the word with the thought included
[1:20:12] amen
[1:20:18] so
[1:20:19] when you come to the end of the church
[1:20:20] ages
[1:20:23] there is a word
[1:20:25] that he will have a bride without spot
[1:20:27] or wrinkle
[1:20:29] he will have a bride that will be be
[1:20:32] united with him in an invisible union
[1:20:34] and she will be a reflection to the
[1:20:36] earth of who he is
[1:20:39] and what is that it's a manifestation of
[1:20:41] the seventh seal
[1:20:44] so the bride
[1:20:47] the bride
[1:20:52] is the word
[1:20:55] for her day
[1:20:59] which is the seventh seal
[1:21:03] all the other seals were expressed all
[1:21:05] the other ages have been expressed
[1:21:08] but the bride is here to express the
[1:21:10] seventh seal
[1:21:12] whatever the woman was to adam when she
[1:21:14] came out
[1:21:16] is what the bride is to express to
[1:21:18] christ in this day
[1:21:21] the bride is being restored back and
[1:21:23] she's here to express this part of the
[1:21:25] word
[1:21:26] how is she going to express this part of
[1:21:28] the word if she's still disbelieving
[1:21:30] what the prophet gave cutting some away
[1:21:32] and cutting that away but she's got to
[1:21:34] lay in the presence of the sun to bake
[1:21:36] all the greenness out
[1:21:38] because she's got to be the full
[1:21:40] expression of the full word this is not
[1:21:42] a day of partial
[1:21:46] those things of partial understanding
[1:21:48] and partial impartial the days of
[1:21:50] partial are over we've come to the day
[1:21:52] of fullness
[1:21:54] and in the day of fullness amen we've
[1:21:56] got to be the full expression of the
[1:21:59] full word of god and how are we going to
[1:22:01] do it if we're still unsure that what
[1:22:02] the prophet gave us was the full word of
[1:22:04] god
[1:22:05] we've got to lay in the presence of this
[1:22:07] son that was given us and say god bake
[1:22:09] all the greenness out of me make my mind
[1:22:11] out of me make my traditions out of me
[1:22:13] what i used to think the scripture meant
[1:22:15] what i used to think the message was
[1:22:17] make it all out of me god i gotta get it
[1:22:21] all out of me bake it out and make me
[1:22:23] exactly like you so that the life that's
[1:22:25] flowing through this body matches what
[1:22:27] you showed us in the wave
[1:22:32] see
[1:22:33] if
[1:22:34] if our doctrines are not bringing us
[1:22:37] into that manifestation it's time to
[1:22:40] revisit our doctrines
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:44] if
[1:22:45] i mean
[1:22:46] if believing the message means believing
[1:22:48] brother branham was a prophet
[1:22:51] but that i can compromise on the word
[1:22:53] and still be his bride
[1:22:55] then i don't know what the message is
[1:23:01] you can see the devil is bringing great
[1:23:03] deception in our day
[1:23:05] trying to get the churches
[1:23:07] to just relax down and be comfortable
[1:23:10] believing that god's been a prophet
[1:23:13] and that i'm the bride
[1:23:14] and even nobody would say these words
[1:23:17] but we're guilty sometimes friends of
[1:23:19] believing i'm the bride god can never
[1:23:22] leave me behind
[1:23:23] i'm the bride
[1:23:25] anything i do is okay
[1:23:27] because i'm the bride
[1:23:29] now nobody you couldn't get anybody to
[1:23:32] say that with their lips but they're
[1:23:34] saying it with their actions because
[1:23:35] they're doing contrary to what the
[1:23:37] prophet taught us to do and they
[1:23:39] continued to do it contrary to what the
[1:23:41] prophet did but they believe the message
[1:23:43] and they're the bride
[1:23:45] and they would never say like brother
[1:23:48] bam said god just loves me so much he
[1:23:50] doesn't care what i do
[1:23:54] does he love the bride so much
[1:23:57] does he care what she does
[1:24:00] i ask you a question
[1:24:03] will god correct his bride
[1:24:10] that's what this word is to do is make
[1:24:11] all the greenness out of us
[1:24:14] we cannot we cannot say we believe this
[1:24:17] mess this is not a denomination this is
[1:24:20] not i you can't go to a message church
[1:24:22] and be a believer
[1:24:24] you have to be a believer
[1:24:26] it's not there's not admittance you know
[1:24:29] i walk into the doors of a message
[1:24:30] church and i'm a believer and i believe
[1:24:32] god sent a prophet i mean there's
[1:24:34] multitudes that believe god sent a
[1:24:35] prophet amen but that's not really the
[1:24:38] goal of the message that's not what god
[1:24:40] wanted god wanted a people that would
[1:24:42] come to the full life of jesus christ in
[1:24:46] bride form
[1:24:48] that it would be christ in bride form
[1:24:50] manifesting himself to the entire world
[1:24:53] that was the purpose of the message
[1:24:55] that's the seventh seal that's why
[1:24:56] brother branham opened the seals that's
[1:24:58] why god sent a prophet that's why the
[1:25:00] supernatural that's why there's a cloud
[1:25:02] that's why all the stuff that happened
[1:25:04] happened that's why there was raising of
[1:25:06] dead that's why there was opening of
[1:25:07] blinding eyes everything that happened
[1:25:09] happened for this purpose to get a bride
[1:25:11] to full maturity and it takes a full
[1:25:12] word the full light to bring her to full
[1:25:14] maturity to express the full life and
[1:25:17] that's the purpose of the message
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:20] to stop somewhere short and say i
[1:25:22] believe god sent a prophet i go to a
[1:25:24] message church but you know i'm not so
[1:25:25] sure about brother benham said about
[1:25:27] this and i'm not so sure about that and
[1:25:28] i think i've got a right to remarry and
[1:25:30] i think it's okay for me to wear this
[1:25:32] and i
[1:25:35] you see really quickly that the devil
[1:25:38] has got in somewhere and a temptation in
[1:25:41] the wilderness
[1:25:44] because now we're hanging out over here
[1:25:47] my want my desire what i like the way i
[1:25:49] want to look the way i want to live and
[1:25:51] we we we've rejected the very
[1:25:54] message
[1:25:55] well we haven't rejected the message i
[1:25:57] believe god said no no no no
[1:25:59] you haven't taken the authority of a
[1:26:01] prophet in your life
[1:26:04] the voice that god gave us in this day
[1:26:07] to bring the bride to full
[1:26:10] rapture of faith to full harvest
[1:26:12] maturity
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:15] and then somehow
[1:26:17] we get comfortable
[1:26:19] in compromise
[1:26:21] because i'm the bride i believe the
[1:26:23] message i'm the bride
[1:26:25] if you're comfortable and comfortable if
[1:26:28] you're comfortable living contrary to
[1:26:30] what the prophet of god taught us to
[1:26:31] live then i would go back and repent and
[1:26:34] say god there's something wrong with
[1:26:36] i've accepted a lie somewhere
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:39] amen i've accepted something the devil
[1:26:43] has whispered to me somewhere he's used
[1:26:46] something to get me to stop in my growth
[1:26:49] to be coming to this perfect image of a
[1:26:51] bride and i've gotten comfortable being
[1:26:53] in the message and being part of the
[1:26:55] bride but never to be comfortable being
[1:26:58] in the message the message has to be in
[1:27:00] you amen and furthermore the message has
[1:27:02] to come out of you
[1:27:05] you
[1:27:06] you and i are called to be the living
[1:27:08] message the living expression of the
[1:27:10] living word everything brother branham
[1:27:12] preached is supposed to be alive and you
[1:27:14] and i
[1:27:16] and manifested and demonstrated
[1:27:20] i say god bake the greenness out of me
[1:27:23] take this word and bake the greenness
[1:27:24] out of me and help lord help help me
[1:27:28] to line up to that life
[1:27:35] i love the fact that the prophet of god
[1:27:37] was honest with us
[1:27:39] i love the fact that he told his
[1:27:41] mistakes and he told us right and he
[1:27:42] told his wrongs and he told us repent
[1:27:44] and he told all all of that because what
[1:27:46] he did is he set an example for you and
[1:27:48] i that we can walk this path
[1:27:51] god can correct us we can repent you can
[1:27:53] be bride and get something wrong but god
[1:27:55] will bring it to your repentance and you
[1:27:56] can repent and he showed us how to
[1:27:58] repent he showed us how to come back in
[1:28:01] line with the word he showed us that a
[1:28:03] prophet of god can step to the side with
[1:28:05] his own desire but god can spank him and
[1:28:07] bring him right back in line with the
[1:28:09] word and he can repent and even confess
[1:28:11] it to the entire church
[1:28:13] why so you and i would have confidence
[1:28:15] to say no matter what god by the word
[1:28:18] can correct me and bring me back in line
[1:28:20] because god wants me to manifest this
[1:28:22] life
[1:28:24] god doesn't want me to stop somewhere
[1:28:26] along the way and get comfortable in my
[1:28:28] condition i want to grow all the way
[1:28:30] into the full manifestation of jesus
[1:28:32] christ i want to i don't want to stop
[1:28:34] with pretty good i don't want to stop
[1:28:35] with i gotta no i i want to reflect that
[1:28:38] same life that prophet reflected
[1:28:42] and until that happens
[1:28:44] i'm not content
[1:28:47] praise god
[1:28:49] i want to read
[1:28:50] just one more quote
[1:28:53] he said things that are to be now the
[1:28:55] only way that you can be a son or
[1:28:56] daughter of god is because you have to
[1:28:58] be have to have eternal life there's
[1:29:00] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:29:01] god's life only one form of eternal life
[1:29:04] that was god there to be a son of god
[1:29:06] you had to be in him
[1:29:08] always the gene of your life spiritual
[1:29:11] life tonight was in god the father
[1:29:14] before there was even a molecule
[1:29:17] why because you're a thought
[1:29:19] so what are you supposed to be today
[1:29:22] a thought expressed
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:26] so
[1:29:27] you can wake up every morning now and
[1:29:29] say what am i supposed to be today
[1:29:32] i am supposed to be a thought expressed
[1:29:36] that changes things doesn't i'm not a
[1:29:38] person who goes to this church and i'm
[1:29:40] not one who's born in that no i am
[1:29:42] supposed to be a thought of god
[1:29:43] expressed
[1:29:45] expressed as a mother expressed as a
[1:29:47] father expressed as a as a teenager
[1:29:49] expressed as an older person expressed
[1:29:51] as a single express as a married couple
[1:29:53] expressed as a mechanic express what am
[1:29:55] i supposed to be i'm supposed to be a
[1:29:56] thought of god expressed today
[1:30:01] the genie of your life spiritual life
[1:30:02] tonight was in god the father before
[1:30:04] there was even a molecule and you're
[1:30:06] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:30:07] gene of life that was in god as a son
[1:30:10] now you're expressed after his word has
[1:30:12] come in you to light up this age
[1:30:15] you are expressing god's life in you
[1:30:17] because you are a son or daughter of god
[1:30:19] therefore you get what i mean see you
[1:30:21] are now made you're sitting in this
[1:30:23] church tonight because your duty is to
[1:30:26] express god to this nation and this
[1:30:28] people and this neighborhood where you
[1:30:30] associate
[1:30:31] wherever you are god knew that you would
[1:30:33] be here because you have to be one of
[1:30:35] his genes or his attributes you had to
[1:30:37] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[1:30:40] life then it always was eternal life and
[1:30:43] god before there was a foundation of the
[1:30:44] world knew that you would be here and
[1:30:46] when the word or the water the washing
[1:30:48] of the water the word fell on you it was
[1:30:51] expressed
[1:30:52] in a being
[1:30:55] that means that thought that god had was
[1:30:57] his attribute to see gene and it fell
[1:31:00] into the earth and was enshrouded in
[1:31:01] dirt and that was you amen but when the
[1:31:04] water of the washing and the water word
[1:31:06] fell it became the thought became an
[1:31:09] expressed being
[1:31:12] and so now what are you
[1:31:14] you are supposed to be the manifestation
[1:31:17] of the thought of god
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:22] i don't think there's any room
[1:31:25] for slowing down stopping progress
[1:31:27] taking a break stepping off to the side
[1:31:30] being content
[1:31:32] i think what god wants what god saw
[1:31:35] for me is what i want for me
[1:31:38] i can't produce it in my life i can't
[1:31:39] make it happen but by the grace of god
[1:31:41] he's predestinated me to fulfill a
[1:31:43] certain role
[1:31:45] but what does he need for me he needs me
[1:31:48] to surrender
[1:31:50] he needs me to yield to surrender to
[1:31:53] recognize his mechanism for bringing me
[1:31:56] into harvest maturity which is this word
[1:31:59] and he needs me to submit to it
[1:32:02] he's not going he's not going to take us
[1:32:06] mold us all up and make no he's looking
[1:32:08] for somebody who will surrender
[1:32:09] themselves to him and then he'll take
[1:32:11] and bring us up and grow us in what
[1:32:14] we're supposed to be
[1:32:16] i said lord
[1:32:17] let me reflect that
[1:32:20] galatians 4 19 my little children of
[1:32:22] whom i travail in birth
[1:32:24] until christ be formed
[1:32:26] in you
[1:32:29] did brother branham show us
[1:32:31] what god was like
[1:32:35] we can all stand
[1:32:36] musicians shouldn't come
[1:32:41] did you when you saw that man did you
[1:32:43] see christ
[1:32:46] that was the goal friends
[1:32:49] that's our example
[1:32:51] and if the revelation that he had would
[1:32:53] bring him into that position if it would
[1:32:56] work for one son of god it'll work for
[1:32:58] all sons of god
[1:33:00] and we have to have confidence in this
[1:33:02] message that god gives us that if i will
[1:33:04] lay in the presence of the son and i
[1:33:06] will feed on this message this message
[1:33:08] will bring me to that life
[1:33:10] i can't do it by myself but the spirit
[1:33:12] of god will anoint the word inside of me
[1:33:14] and bring to manifestation the full word
[1:33:17] of god
[1:33:18] i have to trust it
[1:33:20] i have to trust that it will i have to
[1:33:22] stay in it and let it work
[1:33:24] it's wonderful work in my life
[1:33:27] god bless you friends let's bow our
[1:33:28] heads and pray
[1:33:30] lord jesus i thank you father for this
[1:33:32] word that you've given us
[1:33:35] i thank you god that
[1:33:37] you've given us an example lord
[1:33:40] that we can see
[1:33:42] you gave us your word you gave us the
[1:33:43] perfect interpretation of the word but
[1:33:45] you brought it lord
[1:33:47] through somebody that was born in sin
[1:33:49] like i was
[1:33:50] you bought it through somebody who had
[1:33:52] hardships and trials and failures just
[1:33:55] like me so i can look to what you did
[1:33:57] there and have confidence that what you
[1:33:59] did there you'll do inside of me
[1:34:02] god this message has been on display
[1:34:04] before it's on display now it'll be on
[1:34:07] display in the future i say lord help me
[1:34:09] delay in your presence and
[1:34:12] bake all the greenness out of me lord
[1:34:15] help me father to stay with this word
[1:34:17] and stay true to this word
[1:34:19] god forgive me for my
[1:34:21] my selfishness lord my self-desire
[1:34:25] god but help me just to stay true to the
[1:34:27] calling you've called me to
[1:34:30] for god i'm so thankful for that life
[1:34:32] that i saw
[1:34:34] i'm thankful for 1200 tapes i'm thankful
[1:34:36] for testimonies of saints i'm thankful
[1:34:38] for the books that were written i'm
[1:34:40] thankful for what you gave me lord
[1:34:43] god i just can't express my gratitude
[1:34:45] enough that i have seen the example of
[1:34:48] what was preached so i would know how to
[1:34:49] understand what was preached
[1:34:52] you showed us what your goal is in this
[1:34:54] day you've told us what your target is
[1:34:57] lord you've aimed us for that target and
[1:34:59] i prayed lord that by your spirit you
[1:35:01] would make each one of us hit that
[1:35:03] target
[1:35:05] god we just yield ourselves to you a
[1:35:07] fresh lord
[1:35:08] god we want to yield every day lord wash
[1:35:11] us by the washing of the water of the
[1:35:13] word wash our minds lord wash our human
[1:35:16] spirits wash us

[1:35:21] called us to be in this day
[1:35:24] for god i believe with all my heart
[1:35:26] that we were in your thinking before the
