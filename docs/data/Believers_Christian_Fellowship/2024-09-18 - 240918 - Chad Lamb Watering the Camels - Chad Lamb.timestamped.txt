[14:15] amen and God bless you all it's
[14:17] certainly good to be here thank God for
[14:20] the privilege every time that he gives
[14:23] me a chance to serve him in whatever
[14:25] capacity it is even if it's just coming
[14:27] to church to show whose side I'm on in
[14:29] what I believe it's still a privilege
[14:32] amen so I thank God for that if you want
[14:35] to take your Bibles while we're standing
[14:36] and go to Genesis 24 together I want to
[14:40] welcome back brother Benjamin and
[14:41] Brother Kyle it's good to have you guys
[14:43] back in the service we always miss your
[14:45] amens when you're gone so now you got to
[14:47] pull double duty you've missed the
[14:49] service so it's good to have you back
[14:51] amen and uh also wanted to remind you
[14:54] that tomorrow night I'll be having the
[14:55] church age book Bible study we kind of
[14:58] get out of sequence once in a while but
[15:00] we're going to have it tomorrow and I'm
[15:02] really excited about tomorrow tomorrow
[15:03] cuz we're going to go into the book of
[15:04] life so I'm looking forward to that one
[15:06] so if you can make it it'd be
[15:09] nice uh before I read Genesis 24 I just
[15:13] want to give a disclaimer amen I'm I'm
[15:16] preaching on the heels of brother
[15:17] Emanuel he opened the door and I
[15:19] couldn't get away from the inspiration
[15:21] he came last Wednesday and preached out
[15:23] of Genesis 24 but what was amazing to me
[15:25] when I was sitting in my seat is I was
[15:28] actually in the in earlier part of the
[15:30] day preparing for the wedding on Friday
[15:32] because I was going to Sister Annie's
[15:34] wedding out in Holmes County and I was
[15:36] meditating on Genesis 24 and eleazer in
[15:39] the bridegroom uh the bride call from
[15:42] the eleazer ministry so when he came and
[15:44] started preaching on Genesis 24 I said
[15:47] well that's my confirmation praise God
[15:50] and so he opened some things that I got
[15:52] really excited about and I've been
[15:53] meditating on I'm going to share those
[15:54] with you uh tonight but then I go to the
[15:57] wedding on
[15:59] Friday morning and Friday morning they
[16:02] start the wedding not in a traditional
[16:04] way they don't walk down the aisle Levi
[16:06] doesn't take Annie what they do is they
[16:09] start by having a brother come up and
[16:10] read a huge portion out of Genesis
[16:15] 24 and then they acted out the whole
[16:18] scene they went they had a well amen and
[16:21] Annie was waiting by the well and her
[16:24] husband Chris was sent by his father so
[16:26] Chris you know wasn't eleazer he was
[16:27] both he was eleazer and ISAC he was sent
[16:30] to fetch a bride and instead of camels
[16:32] they had ponies so he and the groomsman
[16:34] come up with ponies and she gave them
[16:36] drink and watered the ponies and and the
[16:38] whole dialogue took place and I said
[16:40] well just praise God Amen so I it was my
[16:44] turn you know after they finished as
[16:46] soon as they finished and Levi agreed to
[16:49] let them go now and they went and sat
[16:51] down and I come right to the pull pit
[16:52] and I said I don't even need to read my
[16:54] scripture they already been read and so
[16:57] it was exciting so even though brother
[17:00] Manuel opened the door and then Friday I
[17:02] just can't get away with it so we're
[17:03] going to go back to Genesis
[17:05] 24 and let's look at uh uh verse 10
[17:13] now it says and the servant Genesis
[17:16] 24:10 and the servant took 10 camels of
[17:19] the camels of his master and departed
[17:21] for all the goods of his master when
[17:23] were in his hand and he arose and went
[17:26] to Mesopotamia into the city of nahor
[17:28] and he made his camels to kneel down
[17:30] without the City by The Well of water at
[17:32] the time of the evening even the time
[17:35] that the women go out to draw water
[17:37] brother Brenham draws attention to so
[17:38] many points here but uh but even the
[17:40] fact that it was the evening time
[17:42] because this is an evening time message
[17:43] it's an evening time when elazer finds
[17:45] the bride for the promised son though
[17:48] it's speaking of our time verse 12 and
[17:50] he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham
[17:52] I pray thee send me good speed this day
[17:55] and show kindness unto my master Abraham
[17:58] behold I Stand Here by The Well of water
[18:00] and the daughters of the men of the city
[18:03] came out to draw water and let it come
[18:06] to pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[18:08] say let down thy picture I pray thee
[18:11] that I may drink and she shall say drink
[18:13] and I will give thy camels drink also
[18:16] let the same be she that thou Hast
[18:18] appointed for thy servant Isaac and
[18:21] thereby shall I know that thou has
[18:22] showed kindness unto my master man may
[18:25] God bless you as you take your seats may
[18:28] God bless us as we look into his
[18:31] word amen so for the subject tonight I'd
[18:35] like to take watering the
[18:37] camels uh and so we we'll just build on
[18:40] this thought and we know that eleazer
[18:43] amen is a type of the end time servant
[18:45] to M time ministry that brother brandom
[18:46] fulfilled perfectly and and he wanted
[18:49] that to be you know the Fulfillment of
[18:51] his ministry when he was seeking what
[18:52] his ministry should be God directed him
[18:54] to this scripture so that he would know
[18:56] this is his purpose and part of his
[18:58] ministry was to fetch a bride for Isaac
[19:01] and so he was so faithful in doing that
[19:03] and it's amazing he come to The Well of
[19:05] water amen at the evening time and when
[19:08] the maidens come out to fetch water and
[19:09] when women come out to fetch water and
[19:12] and he has a prayer and we find out
[19:14] later uh I I think somewhere in the uh
[19:17] verse 43 or 44 when he begins to recount
[19:20] this tale Amen to her family he says
[19:23] before I had done praying in my heart
[19:25] yes amen he didn't say anything out loud
[19:28] this was a price private prayer between
[19:29] him and God and I'll know the right
[19:32] woman amen if she picks up this silent
[19:34] mystery amen when I ask her for a drink
[19:37] of water if she says I'll give you drink
[19:39] and also I'll Water your camels then
[19:41] that's the one that you choose amen so
[19:43] brother Bram teaches all of this and he
[19:45] goes into that in great detail but let's
[19:47] go back to verse 15 and
[19:49] read here in verse
[19:51] 15 says and it came to pass before he
[19:54] had done speaking that behold Rebecca
[19:57] came out who was born to Bethel son of
[19:59] milka the wife of nahor Abraham's
[20:02] brother with her picture upon her
[20:04] shoulder it's important to note here who
[20:07] this is uh like Emanuel was brother
[20:09] Emanuel was telling us last Wednesday
[20:11] amen uh this this eleazer couldn't just
[20:15] get a woman from anywhere she couldn't
[20:16] he couldn't get a Canaanite he couldn't
[20:18] get a perizzite he couldn't get a hivite
[20:20] he couldn't get a hittite he couldn't
[20:22] get anybody that was nearby but he had
[20:24] to go back to the original bloodline had
[20:26] to be the original Family the original
[20:28] bloodline and he went back and it just
[20:30] so happened that this Maiden who came
[20:32] when he prayed amen was part of the same
[20:35] family she was a granddaughter of
[20:37] Abraham's brother so she was part of the
[20:40] original life prise God the original
[20:45] bloodline and she came with her picture
[20:48] on her shoulder uh and I want you to
[20:51] catch this imagery this picture on her
[20:53] shoulder and the picture wasn't in her
[20:55] hand but the picture was on her shoulder
[20:57] and so I I'm I'm G to give a bit of
[21:00] speculation so this is Brother Chad's
[21:01] speculation I don't think it was an itty
[21:03] bitty picture like
[21:05] this but it was big enough that she had
[21:07] it up on her shoulder because it would
[21:09] probably been easier to carry than a
[21:10] bigger jug so we're not talking about a
[21:13] tiny picture
[21:15] here and he says and the servant ran to
[21:18] meet her and said let me I pray thee
[21:20] drink a little water of thy
[21:22] pcture and she said drink my Lord and
[21:25] she
[21:27] hasted uh I'm sorry sorry I want to go
[21:29] back sorry go back to verse 16 the
[21:31] beginning of verse 16 at the end of 15
[21:33] she comes with her pitcher on her
[21:34] shoulder and the damel was very fair to
[21:37] look upon a virgin neither had any man
[21:39] known her and she went down to the well
[21:42] and filled her pitcher and came up now
[21:44] look at the language she went down to
[21:46] the well filled her picture and came up
[21:48] because in that arid region back then
[21:51] many of the wells were actually steps
[21:53] leading down to a well that was sunk
[21:55] into the ground where they could find
[21:57] water and they would they didn't have
[21:59] you know the the the wiow and the and
[22:01] the rope and they lowered it down that
[22:03] way no they walked down into the well
[22:05] amen they filled their picture and they
[22:07] walked back up to the top amen if you go
[22:10] and look you can find ancient Wells and
[22:12] they've done some Escavating they found
[22:13] Wells like that and that's many times
[22:15] the way they were and this is the
[22:17] language that's used here amen it gives
[22:19] us that kind of imagery that she came
[22:21] with a picture on her shoulder amen and
[22:23] she went down to the well and filled her
[22:25] picture and came up and the servant ran
[22:28] to meet her and said let me I pray thee
[22:30] drink a little water of thy piture and
[22:32] she said drink my Lord and she hasted
[22:34] and let down her piture upon her hand
[22:36] and gave him a drink and when she had
[22:39] done giving him drink she said I will
[22:41] draw water for thy camels also until
[22:44] they have done
[22:45] drinking and she hasted and emptied her
[22:48] piture into the trough and ran again
[22:50] into the well to draw water and Drew for
[22:52] all his camels and the man wandered at
[22:55] her and held his peace to wit whether
[22:56] the Lord had made his journey prosperous
[22:58] or not and it came to pass as the camels
[23:01] had done drinking that the man took a
[23:03] golden earring of half a shekele weight
[23:06] and two bracelets for her hand of 10
[23:08] shekels weight of gold and said whose
[23:10] daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is
[23:13] there room in thy father's house for us
[23:14] to Lodge in and she said unto him I am
[23:18] the daughter of Bethel the son of milka
[23:20] which she bore unto nahor and she said
[23:22] moreover unto him we have both straw and
[23:25] prender enough and room to Lodge and the
[23:27] man bowed down his head and worshiped
[23:29] the Lord and he said blessed be the Lord
[23:32] God of my master Abraham who ha not left
[23:35] destitute my master of his mercy and his
[23:37] truth I being in the way the Lord led me
[23:40] to the house of my Master's Brethren so
[23:42] he found the destination and God had led
[23:45] him there by the angel of the Lord and
[23:47] and God had supernaturally provided amen
[23:50] the the witness that this is the woman
[23:52] but but the language here is so
[23:54] important and I want to catch it and and
[23:56] look at what it is that this woman did
[23:59] because it's actually an amazing feat
[24:01] what she did and and brother brandham
[24:04] tells us in desperations he said now
[24:06] Eleazar being a spiritual man knowed
[24:09] what it meant the right kind of woman
[24:11] had to be that man's wife and how could
[24:14] he choose it the hour of his desperation
[24:16] when he arrived at the city he prayed
[24:18] and said Lord God that's the thing when
[24:20] you get desperate go to praying Lord God
[24:22] let the first maid that comes forth and
[24:24] Waters the camel and gives me to drink
[24:26] be that he prayed in the hour of his
[24:28] desperation Rebecca the beautiful maid
[24:30] came watered the camel and he said don't
[24:33] delay me in my way she had to come to a
[24:35] time of decision whether she would go
[24:37] she was a type of the Bride would she go
[24:40] and marry a man who she has never seen
[24:43] now that's a great thing never even seen
[24:45] him yet she had only heard his by his
[24:48] servant that's a type of the Bride
[24:50] you've never seen Christ but you hear by
[24:52] his servants what he is and you'll sell
[24:54] out everything leave your homes
[24:56] everything else it takes to go find him
[24:59] now notice she made the decision a type
[25:01] of the Bride left her denominational
[25:03] home seat to go amen so brother B types
[25:07] this all out and shows us that this is
[25:08] elaser amen fetching a bride and and she
[25:11] had to come to the time of decision and
[25:13] that's actually what brother Emanuel was
[25:15] preaching on when he was talking about
[25:17] amen the the seed bride will be willing
[25:20] amen of her own choosing not coerced and
[25:22] not persuaded and not no fear tactics
[25:25] and no no church formalism that pushed
[25:28] her into a no but she was willing amen
[25:31] and she was willing but she was she was
[25:34] testified of Amen by the spirit of God
[25:36] because she could catch the mystery and
[25:38] act it out without anybody having to
[25:40] tell
[25:42] her and she went down into the well and
[25:45] came up to the man he asked for a drink
[25:47] she dropped a picture on her hand amen
[25:50] so that he could have a drink and then
[25:51] she said I'll Water the camels also but
[25:54] I I want you to look at what she
[25:56] said she said Verse 18 said drink my
[26:00] Lord and she hasted and let down her
[26:03] piter upon her hand and gave him drink
[26:05] and when she had done giving him drink
[26:06] she said I will draw water for the
[26:08] camels also until they have done
[26:13] drinking this is going to be important
[26:15] yes she said I will give them water
[26:18] until they're done
[26:21] drinking and the man steps back and
[26:25] watches now his prayer is the woman that
[26:28] Waters the camels Also let her be the
[26:30] one amen and and I don't know about you
[26:32] but I I just know my nature I probably
[26:34] would have been so excited when she got
[26:36] that first when she got that first
[26:38] picture of water and put it in the
[26:39] trough IA ran and said you're it this is
[26:41] but no he's
[26:42] watching he's watching because as
[26:45] brother Emanuel said the bride has to
[26:46] fulfill all the word amen and now he's
[26:49] he's watching she said till they have
[26:51] all drunk until they drink all and so
[26:53] the man's just watching Praise god let's
[26:56] read it
[26:58] verse 19 and when she had done giving
[26:59] him drink she said I will draw water for
[27:01] the camels also until they have done
[27:03] drinking and she hasted and emptied her
[27:05] picture into the trough and ran again to
[27:07] the well to draw water and Drew for all
[27:10] his camels how many camels did he have
[27:12] 10 Drew for all of his camels and the
[27:16] man wondered at her wondering at her
[27:19] held his peace to wit whether the Lord
[27:22] had made his journey prosperous or not
[27:25] he already knew she's watering the
[27:26] camels but he's got to wait and see if
[27:28] she'll go all the
[27:30] way and it came to pass as the camels
[27:33] had done drinking so the camels were
[27:35] done drinking she didn't decide to stop
[27:38] watering them she watered them till they
[27:40] were done
[27:42] drinking you've got that she didn't
[27:45] decide when enough was enough she didn't
[27:48] decide when she was too tired to keep
[27:50] going she watered them till they were
[27:52] done
[27:54] drinking and she and uh
[27:59] verse 22 and it came to pass as the
[28:01] camels had done drinking that the man
[28:03] took a golden earring and a half shekele
[28:05] weight that's when the man begins to
[28:07] Adorn her and shower her and and claim
[28:10] her amen because now he knew this is the
[28:13] one he should I mean to me he knew when
[28:16] she first offered to water the camels
[28:18] but he steps back and watches and makes
[28:20] sure that this one will water all the
[28:24] camels amen I started thinking about
[28:27] this and I had heard heard somebody one
[28:28] time say that that camels drink a lot of
[28:31] water so I went to look it up to find
[28:34] out and I looked it up and it says
[28:38] camels can drink large amounts of water
[28:40] Qui quickly up to 32 gallons in a single
[28:43] drinking
[28:46] session I mean that's with one dip into
[28:49] the water suck up 32 gallons then it
[28:53] says they can also drink 53 gallons of
[28:57] water in 3
[29:01] minutes 3 minutes 53 gallons do you know
[29:05] how much is in a jug of
[29:06] milk one
[29:09] gallon they can drink 53 jugs of water
[29:13] and 3
[29:15] minutes in one session of drinking when
[29:18] they drop their head once to drink they
[29:20] can suck in 32 gallons of
[29:25] water now I don't know how thirsty these
[29:27] camels were
[29:30] I don't
[29:31] know amen the man had set him down by
[29:33] the well and never said he watered him
[29:35] before they were on a journey if these
[29:37] were thirsty camels they were drinking
[29:41] somewhere between 30 and 50 gallons of
[29:43] water a piece and how many were there
[29:47] 10 and what did that woman have to do to
[29:50] water 10 gam camels let's just say they
[29:53] took half that says they had 25 gallons
[29:56] I like using conservative numbers
[29:59] that's
[30:00] 250 gallons of water that they and how
[30:04] fast could they drink them they can
[30:05] drink 53 gallons in 3 minutes it's
[30:07] hopeless every time she fills the trough
[30:10] gone fills the trough gone fills the
[30:11] trough this woman was working and how
[30:14] did she get the water she went down into
[30:16] the well and came up how much did her
[30:19] picture hold maybe two gallons I don't
[30:21] know maybe it could hold three gallons
[30:22] maybe it h one gallon maybe it held four
[30:24] gallons how many trips did she make per
[30:28] camel prise
[30:29] God how how much listen when this man
[30:33] said listen when he said let her that
[30:35] gives me a drink and Waters the camels
[30:37] also he's looking for somebody that'll
[30:39] go all the way somebody that'll sell out
[30:42] somebody that can serve somebody that
[30:45] can give up their time and their effort
[30:46] and their energy for someone
[30:50] else
[30:52] amen camels can drink so much water they
[30:55] can survive up to 15 days without water
[30:58] that's just a
[31:00] bonus that's for the
[31:03] kids so you do the math and I would
[31:07] estimate my estimation somewhere between
[31:09] 250 and 500 gallons of water this woman
[31:14] went down into a well scooped up walked
[31:17] back up one picture at a time and poured
[31:22] it out into the
[31:23] trough and the man sat back and did not
[31:27] offer off to help
[31:29] her and he had servants with
[31:33] him who didn't offer to help her where
[31:36] has shivalry
[31:40] gone this was something she had to do to
[31:43] prove what was inside of
[31:48] her it just so happened she was of the
[31:51] right
[31:53] seedline brother bam starts to talk
[31:55] about this act and he speaks of it
[31:58] several times through the message so I'm
[31:59] just going to pull out a couple but in
[32:01] 1953 there's a message called earnestly
[32:04] contending for the faith that was once
[32:05] delivered to the Saints he said look the
[32:08] very animal that she was watering the
[32:10] animal represents a beast of course a
[32:12] beast of burden which means a power in
[32:14] the Bible remember explains this all the
[32:16] time a white horse is a power and a red
[32:18] horse is a power and the Beast that rise
[32:20] out of the sea is a power and so he's
[32:22] he's referring this to the it's a power
[32:25] and the Very animal that she was
[32:26] watering was the very animal that packed
[32:28] her to see her bride is that right and
[32:31] what is watering the very power that
[32:33] we're watering now with praises and
[32:36] Thanksgiving and glory and power and
[32:38] might is the very Holy Spirit that'll
[32:40] pack us by uh pack us up to see Jesus
[32:44] someday he said the very camels she was
[32:46] watering amen what she was serving was
[32:49] the very power that was going to carry
[32:50] her to Isaac amen amen and and what and
[32:55] what what I want to look at is the way
[32:56] she served how did she serve it wasn't
[32:59] half-hearted it wasn't half effort it
[33:02] wasn't the minimum that she can do amen
[33:04] when she committed to watering the
[33:06] camels she committed to a Monumental
[33:09] task of watering the camels and she
[33:11] didn't stop till all the camels had done
[33:15] drinking amen it wasn't tempted to say
[33:19] okay okay okay move out of the way
[33:20] you've had enough you've had 20
[33:22] gallons next
[33:24] camel she watered all the camels am
[33:28] until they were all done
[33:31] drinking my
[33:34] goodness this is a type of the Bride
[33:37] amen so what kind of character must the
[33:39] bride have what has to be inside of her
[33:43] and listen Rebecca did it not because
[33:46] somebody told her to she did it because
[33:47] something inside her told her to do
[33:52] it and so the very power that we are
[33:54] watering now with praises and
[33:57] Thanksgiving and glory and power and
[34:01] might is the very Holy Spirit that'll
[34:03] pack us up to see Jesus
[34:05] someday so he's watering it by praises
[34:08] and by worship and by glory and by
[34:10] surrender and by adoration and they're
[34:13] watering this this power which is the
[34:15] Holy Spirit and this is what he says in
[34:18] in in 1953 and he uses this very similar
[34:22] terminology all the way up till he gets
[34:24] the seals but when he gets the seals he
[34:26] changes terminology and we're going to
[34:28] we're going to look at that he says now
[34:30] in questions and answers uh from 1964 he
[34:33] says and Rebecca had to make the choice
[34:35] cuz he said she is the maid let her make
[34:38] the choice and as soon as it was made to
[34:40] her quickly her mind was made up she
[34:42] said I'll go and she mounted up the the
[34:45] camel and went to meet look the very
[34:48] camel she watered was the camel that
[34:50] packed her to her bridegroom and all of
[34:52] her success and the Very camel the very
[34:55] power that beast in the Bible presents
[34:58] power and the Very power that will give
[35:00] that will give water and pray that we
[35:02] give water and praise to water life
[35:06] praise to the word is the very thing
[35:09] that packs us into glory land to meet
[35:11] the bridegroom what is it we're watering
[35:14] the word amen what is it we're giving
[35:16] praise and glory and honor and worship
[35:18] to the word what is it that's going to
[35:20] pack us to our bridegroom the word amen
[35:23] and how did she water the word amen what
[35:26] effort did she do what extent did she go
[35:29] to how much was she willing and how far
[35:31] was she willing to go to water to word
[35:34] until all the word was done
[35:38] drinking this is the character amen that
[35:41] Eleazar was looking for this is what he
[35:43] asked for this is why he didn't help her
[35:46] he didn't send his men to help her amen
[35:48] she needed to prove what was inside of
[35:50] her this is what brother Emanuel it
[35:52] struck me when he was here last
[35:54] Wednesday he was saying amen you're
[35:56] you're not going to have to be puru
[35:57] persuaded you must repent you must
[35:59] repent amen but the bride's going to go
[36:01] all the way with the word when she sees
[36:03] the word she'll water all the word how
[36:05] does she water the word with her worship
[36:06] and her praise and her glory and her
[36:08] surrender she's worshiping the very
[36:10] power that's going to carry her all the
[36:12] way to her
[36:14] bridegroom and so how do we worship amen
[36:17] we don't worship half-heartedly we don't
[36:18] surrender and praise and worship the
[36:20] word with half of our hearts amen we've
[36:22] got to give everything to it that's the
[36:24] character he's looking for that's the
[36:25] nature of the Bride that was the only
[36:27] only one that would work for
[36:29] Isaac the promised
[36:32] son you think when you think about it
[36:35] look when I just stop and think about
[36:37] the request Eleazar
[36:39] made he's looking for a
[36:42] virgin a maiden a young
[36:46] woman not a Burly
[36:50] man not somebody strong and
[36:53] powerful he's making this request of a
[36:56] virgin amen a maid a young unmarried
[37:01] woman and what he asked is that she
[37:03] moves do you know listen do you know
[37:06] that water is approximately 8 lb per
[37:11] gallon 8 lb per gallon now I can't do
[37:15] that math in my head right now some of
[37:17] you can but that that's 800 lb every 100
[37:21] gallons right please somebody help
[37:24] me 800 lb every 100 gallons and the
[37:29] camels in my estimation probably had at
[37:31] least 250 gallons to 500 gallons so
[37:34] you're looking at 1600 and half and 2000
[37:37] 2,000 lb of water a minimum she moved
[37:39] for those camels how did she move 2,000
[37:43] lb of water with the pitcher that was on
[37:45] her shoulder by going down in the well
[37:46] and coming up and emptying into the
[37:48] trough I'm telling you the bride is
[37:50] going to be a special woman she's not
[37:52] going to be the denominational type
[37:54] she's not going to be a half-hearted
[37:55] Christian giving half her effort half
[37:57] her time half her mind half her energy
[37:59] half her resources that's not the kind
[38:01] that Christ is looking
[38:03] for amen there's got to be something in
[38:06] her that says I'll Water the camels
[38:09] nobody has to make me amen and I'm not
[38:11] going to do the bare minimum I'm going
[38:13] all the
[38:15] way praise
[38:17] God so now the very power brother man
[38:20] said that we give water and praise to
[38:23] what is it watering it's giving praise
[38:26] and worship and honor and
[38:30] Glory he says the very power that we
[38:33] give water and praise to water life
[38:35] praise to the word is the very thing
[38:38] that packs us into glory to meet the
[38:42] bridegroom what should the bride's
[38:45] attitude towards the word
[38:49] be in the fifth
[38:51] seal brother Ram says now he's in the
[38:53] seals and he's in the fifth seal says it
[38:56] also represents holy power to a beast
[38:59] did you know that notice Rebecca when
[39:01] the servant of Abraham Eleazar when he
[39:03] come to get Rebecca he mounted her up on
[39:05] a camel the very camel she watered and
[39:09] she rode this camel to meet her unseen
[39:11] bridegroom the very thing she watered
[39:13] was the thing that took her to her
[39:15] future home and husband and it's the
[39:17] same thing today the very thing that the
[39:20] church is watering that is the seed the
[39:23] seed of the word it's the very word that
[39:25] becomes alive and Carries us to our
[39:27] unseen bridegroom what's the very thing
[39:29] we're watering the seed what seed the
[39:31] seed of the word and as we're watering
[39:33] that word with our glory and our praise
[39:35] and our worship and our surrender amen
[39:37] that very word is coming to life and
[39:40] will carry us to our
[39:43] bridegroom so what is it we're watering
[39:45] what is the camels we're watering it's
[39:47] the word that's been giv to us in this
[39:49] hour amen it's the it's our it's our
[39:52] bridegroom amen the revealed
[39:54] word our husband this message that's
[39:57] been given to us this message is not the
[39:59] mind of a man this message is not the
[40:01] collection of Doctrine this message is
[40:03] Jesus Christ present today manifesting
[40:06] himself for real standing here saying
[40:08] this is me that's what the message is
[40:11] it's not 1200 tapes it's not books it's
[40:13] not a series of doctrines it is the
[40:15] person of Jesus Christ coming to reveal
[40:17] himself to his bride that's the word
[40:19] that we're worshiping that's the word
[40:21] that's packing us to
[40:25] him amen
[40:29] and that's why no church is going to do
[40:31] it it's going to take the word that's
[40:34] going to carry
[40:35] us not a church not a group not anything
[40:39] else it's going to be the word that
[40:41] carries
[40:43] us and the very thing that we have to
[40:47] water is the very thing that c carries
[40:50] us along the way it's the very power
[40:54] that we ride on
[40:57] brother bham says in the message Satan's
[41:02] Eden I heard brother Neville say this
[41:04] morning someone might have been asking
[41:06] him why didn't I preach on the Holy
[41:08] Ghost why didn't I do this it's amazing
[41:12] even brother Brenham and his own
[41:13] congregation was criticized for why he
[41:15] preached some things and didn't preach
[41:16] others and he didn't preach enough on
[41:17] this and he preached too much on
[41:19] that if it happened to the prophet it'll
[41:22] probably happen to us
[41:23] all he says now I heard brother Neville
[41:27] say this morning someone might have been
[41:28] asking him why didn't I preach on the
[41:30] Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it
[41:32] is the Holy Ghost is the action in you
[41:36] it's a
[41:37] life not an emotion not some sort of
[41:40] fleshly evidence but it's a person Jesus
[41:43] Christ the word of God established in
[41:45] your heart to Quicken every word of this
[41:48] age right watch the holy GH watch the
[41:51] Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[41:53] demonstration but in action what it does
[41:56] according to the word what is the Holy
[41:59] Ghost it's the power it's the action
[42:01] that makes the word live it's the
[42:03] manifestation of the word it's the power
[42:06] that that that energizes and quickens
[42:08] the word and makes the word manifest
[42:10] itself in our lives Amen brother benam
[42:12] said over and over what was that power
[42:14] that she was watering it was the Holy
[42:16] Ghost then he says what was that power
[42:18] she was watering it was the
[42:21] word because the word is Christ amen the
[42:25] word is him the life of the word is the
[42:28] Life of Christ the Holy Ghost is the
[42:30] spirit of
[42:31] Christ and there's a life in this word
[42:34] and the life in this word amen as we
[42:37] serve it that's the power that is
[42:39] carrying us along praise God amen
[42:43] amen
[42:45] amen not a not a stale stagnant word
[42:48] that you can just read on paper and say
[42:50] that's the word that's not the
[42:52] word those are words
[42:57] not just a teaching that you can recite
[43:00] back that's that not necessarily the
[43:04] word that can be words but that's not
[43:07] the word the word is a person amen the
[43:11] word is Christ the word is God himself
[43:15] the life of God in the word amen and
[43:17] when you get that word you get the
[43:21] life amen we can have words we can
[43:24] recite words we can be trained to rep
[43:27] peep back correct Doctrine we can line
[43:29] up certain biblical teachings amen and
[43:31] you can have that as as word like word
[43:35] we understand in the English language
[43:36] amen but that doesn't mean you've yet
[43:38] had the person of the word because the
[43:40] person of the word is the life of that
[43:41] word that comes in and makes all that
[43:43] word life living life packing us
[43:47] carrying us moving us manifesting itself
[43:50] along the
[43:51] way
[43:53] amen you can't tell me that you can have
[43:57] the word and not have the
[44:03] spirit because the word is
[44:05] Christ you can have words you can have
[44:08] technical words but if you get the
[44:12] word you have
[44:15] Christ he's the life of the
[44:18] word he's the word that's been restored
[44:20] he's our bridegroom the revealed word
[44:23] he's our husband he's the one who's
[44:25] returned in this hour amen he's the one
[44:28] we're uniting
[44:33] with
[44:35] amen I'd like to turn the page just for
[44:38] a minute and go to 2 Samuel and go to
[44:41] another story Al
[44:49] together 2 Samuel 23
[45:09] 2 Samuel uh let's go to chapter
[45:15] 23 I'm going to read from verse
[45:18] 14 and David was then in the hold and
[45:22] the Garrison of the Philistines was in
[45:24] Bethlehem and David longed and said oh
[45:26] that one would give me drink of the
[45:28] water of The Well of Bethlehem which is
[45:30] by the gate and the three Mighty Men
[45:33] break through the host of the
[45:34] Philistines and Drew water out of the
[45:36] well of Bethlehem that was by the gate
[45:38] and took it and brought it to David
[45:40] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[45:42] but poured it out unto the Lord Brother
[45:44] Benham talks about this story
[45:46] extensively in the message why little
[45:49] Bethlehem from 1963 it it be good for
[45:51] you to listen to it because it's so
[45:53] fantastic the way brother B I'm going to
[45:55] read several quotes from that message
[45:57] amen if I read a quote and don't
[45:59] reference this it's probably from why
[46:00] little Bethlehem but David desired a
[46:03] drink and David wanted a drink see David
[46:07] wanted to be
[46:09] watered and who was David David was the
[46:13] Manifest word for his day he was
[46:15] anointed to be king for his day he was
[46:18] the Fulfillment of a prophecy he was a
[46:19] man that God had chosen after his own
[46:21] heart he was anointed to be the word for
[46:23] his day amen and he longed to be watered
[46:26] he wanted to have a drink but not any
[46:28] drink will do he didn't want any of the
[46:30] waters no doubt in the cave they were in
[46:32] the ho no doubt they had Waters and jugs
[46:34] and Waters and barrels amen but he
[46:36] wanted a certain he was thirsty for a
[46:38] certain kind of water he wanted the
[46:40] water from the well at Bethlehem he had
[46:43] a certain taste that could only be
[46:45] satisfied this water here and this warm
[46:48] water in this jug and this water in that
[46:50] City and town it won't do anything for
[46:52] me but the water that I'm really craving
[46:54] that I want to be watered by is the
[46:56] water
[46:58] Bethlehem amen the problem was Bethlehem
[47:00] was garrisoned about by a Garrison of
[47:03] Philistines it was treacherous to get to
[47:05] that water it was nearly impossible to
[47:07] get to that water but that's the water
[47:08] he wanted not the easy water in The
[47:13] Jug not just giving Eleazar a drink but
[47:16] the camels a drink not the easy one but
[47:18] the hard
[47:20] oneise God
[47:23] amen amen am said he who gives me a
[47:26] drink is not just serving the prophet
[47:29] and say I believe you're eleazer and
[47:30] I'll I'll give you a drink and and I'll
[47:32] give you respect and honor but not just
[47:34] elazer but the whole mess of word that
[47:37] he brought has to be watered too because
[47:39] that's the power that's carrying us home
[47:41] Eleazar is it carrying us home he's
[47:43] leading but the power is the
[47:46] word and now David the anointed word for
[47:49] his day he longs to be watered by a cool
[47:52] drink of fresh water from where from
[47:55] Bethlehem where did David come from
[47:57] where was David's origin where did David
[47:59] come from on this Earth he came from
[48:01] Bethlehem what kind of water did he want
[48:03] he wanted water from home he wanted
[48:05] original water he wanted water from his
[48:09] birthplace that's the water he
[48:13] wanted my goodness and brother Brenham
[48:15] says now the name bethlehem's means the
[48:18] house of God's
[48:19] bread now how fitting that is to Jesus
[48:22] the bread of eternal life Christ is the
[48:24] bread of life we all believe that don't
[48:26] we how fitting Bethlehem there and the
[48:29] bread center of the world was the bread
[48:30] Center of eternal life that's why the
[48:34] king had to be born there he said
[48:36] Bethlehem lived in a wheat rich country
[48:38] and it was the bread Center of of that
[48:41] nation of Israel amen because amen the
[48:44] bread of life was going to come from
[48:45] Bethlehem amen that's why David had to
[48:48] be born there because there was going to
[48:49] be a son of David that was going to sit
[48:51] on the throne amen and so David had to
[48:53] be born in Bethlehem the house of God's
[48:56] bread where is Jesus going to be born in
[48:58] Bethlehem the house of God's bread and
[49:00] brother Bram said eternal life
[49:03] bread turn with me to John chapter
[49:11] 6 John chapter

[49:24] bread of
[49:25] life where did he come from
[49:28] Bethlehem what is he the bread of life
[49:31] where did the bread of life come from
[49:33] where did the wheat come from from the
[49:34] wheat Center where did the bread come
[49:36] from the bread of life came from
[49:40] Bethlehem amen said I am that bread of
[49:43] life your fathers did eat Mana in the
[49:44] wilderness and and are dead this is the
[49:47] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[49:49] a man may eat thereof and not die what
[49:52] kind of bread is that eternal life bread
[49:55] you eat this bread you'll not die even
[49:58] the Mana that fell from heaven in the
[50:00] days of of The Exodus when they ate that
[50:03] they still died but this is eternal life
[50:05] bread that came from Heaven that come
[50:07] through Bethlehem that was now available
[50:09] and he said if you eat this bread you'll
[50:11] not
[50:12] die I am the living bread which cometh
[50:16] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[50:17] bread he shall live forever and the
[50:20] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[50:22] I will give for the life of the
[50:24] world what is the bread
[50:27] his flesh what is his flesh the word was
[50:31] made
[50:34] flesh what is his flesh the manifested
[50:37] word for the
[50:39] day the Living Word the manifested word
[50:43] that was the Flesh and he said my My
[50:45] Flesh I give to
[50:47] you is the bread of
[50:50] life praise God let's go down to verse
[50:54] 53 then Jesus said unto them verily
[50:56] verily I say unto you except you eat the
[50:58] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[51:00] blood you have no life in you who so
[51:02] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood

[51:13] blood dwelleth in me and I in
[51:17] him we have to eat his flesh yes
[51:21] remember this is the saying that
[51:22] confused so many and caused so many to
[51:24] walk out because all they saw was the
[51:26] natural amen they didn't realize amen

[51:30] took the bread of the communion he said

[51:52] come no other way but by the word that's
[51:55] the only place he could be born is by
[51:57] that Bethlehem that's why it had to be
[52:00] that little humble Place why Bethlehem
[52:03] he had to come from Bethlehem because
[52:05] Bethlehem is the house of God's bread
[52:07] because he was the bread that came down
[52:08] from
[52:09] heaven his flesh was meat his flesh was
[52:13] bread we had to eat his
[52:17] flesh what was his flesh the word made

[54:33] people back to when the Holy Ghost came

[54:40] came to life and they became the
[54:42] Manifest word for their day let's go
[54:44] back that's the drink that he's looking
[54:46] for back to Pentecost back to the
[54:50] word said it's prophesied we'll do so in
[54:54] Malachi the 4th chapter return the faith
[54:56] of the children back to the fathers
[54:58] again who would stand this
[55:00] morning man let's go to John chapter 4
[55:02] just skip over just a couple
[55:05] chapters to the beginning of John
[55:07] chapter
[55:17] 4 John chapter
[55:19] 4:7 we all know this portion of
[55:22] scripture we probably haven't memorized
[55:23] as the woman at the well in Samaria
[55:26] but in verse 7 it says there cometh a
[55:28] woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus say
[55:30] unto her give me to
[55:32] drink he wants a
[55:35] drink he wants to be watered he wants a
[55:38] drink and the woman says but how can you
[55:40] ask me a Samaritan how can we mix this
[55:42] up and how can we get a drink and Jesus
[55:44] has an answer he's looking for a drink
[55:46] but he's looking for a different drink
[55:48] than what she's
[55:49] thinking he says give me to drink so he
[55:53] starts the dialogue let's go down to
[55:54] verse 13 and Jesus answered and said
[55:57] unto her whosoever drinketh of this
[55:59] water he's pointing at Jacob's Well
[56:02] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[56:04] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[56:07] the water that I shall give him shall
[56:09] never thirst but the water that I shall
[56:11] give him shall be in him a well of water
[56:14] springing up into everlasting
[56:16] life oh praise God Jesus is saying he's
[56:20] come to a well once again he's come to a
[56:23] well when he's at the well he comes to a
[56:25] predestined at seed he's there waiting
[56:27] for a predestinated seed when she comes
[56:29] to that predestinated seed the
[56:31] manifested word says give me a drink I
[56:34] want a drink will you give me a drink
[56:36] why cuz Eleazar said I want a drink amen
[56:39] cuz David said I want to drink and Jesus
[56:41] stands and says I want a drink and she
[56:43] says how this isn't customary how can I
[56:45] do it and he said you if you knew who
[56:47] were speaking to you you would ask me of
[56:48] a drink and I'd give you Waters that you
[56:50] thirst no more and she said how are you
[56:52] going to do this the D is deep you have
[56:54] nothing to draw with and he says now
[56:56] then is when we get into this and he
[56:58] says whosoever drinketh of this water
[57:00] shall thirst again but whosoever
[57:02] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[57:04] him shall never thirst again what is
[57:08] this water amen this is the water of
[57:10] life amen this is the water the original
[57:12] water the Water of Life the water of the
[57:15] word the water that you'll never thirst
[57:17] again because Jesus was the Fountain of
[57:20] eternal life he was the well that she
[57:22] needed to drink from he was the original
[57:24] he was the word he was from from the
[57:26] beginning he was the logos made flesh he
[57:28] was the Fountain of Living Waters and he
[57:30] said if you come and drink through if
[57:32] you fight your way through your own
[57:34] understanding you fight your way through
[57:36] your own condition if you move your way
[57:38] beyond what you're thinking and your
[57:39] condition your Samaritan ways and you
[57:41] come and drink of this water you'll
[57:43] never thirst
[57:45] again cuz it's lifegiving Eternal water
[57:48] from the original Source but she had to
[57:50] move past her traditional thinking she
[57:52] had to move past her religion of the day
[57:54] and she had to recognize who was
[58:00] there he said who whosoever drink of the
[58:02] water that I shall give him shall never
[58:05] thirst but the water that I shall give
[58:07] him shall be in
[58:11] him am a well of water springing up into
[58:15] everlasting
[58:20] life verse
[58:22] 23 when she finally comes to the
[58:24] realization of who the this
[58:27] is she says but the hour cometh and now
[58:30] is she asked the question where are we
[58:34] going to worship and how are we going to
[58:35] worship
[58:37] God and this is his answer the hour
[58:40] cometh verse 23 and now is when the true
[58:43] worshippers shall worship the father in
[58:46] spirit and in truth for the father
[58:50] seeketh such to worship Him what's he
[58:53] saying the father wants a
[58:57] drink amen he wants to be
[59:00] refreshed how are you going to refresh
[59:02] him the only thing that will refresh him
[59:04] is when you come with spirit and
[59:08] Truth he wants to he wants to be
[59:10] worshiped the father's seeking those
[59:12] that will worship Him how do you water
[59:14] how does she water the camels it was in
[59:16] praise and in worship and glory and
[59:17] surrender and admiration that's
[59:20] worship and the father seeking such to
[59:22] worship Him in spirit and Truth he wants
[59:24] a drink but any water is not going to do
[59:28] he wants to be watered he said God is a
[59:31] spirit and they that worship Him must
[59:33] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[59:40] amen elazer wanted a
[59:43] drink David wanted a drink Jesus wanted
[59:47] a drink the father wants a drink prise

[1:05:42] looking for somebody amen that'll
[1:05:45] worship Him in spirit into truth

[1:05:54] themselves to give him what he desires
[1:05:57] it wasn't what the three wanted it's
[1:05:59] what God wanted it's what David wanted

[1:23:37] and sacred and so holy no man could
[1:23:40] drink from it what is that offering it's
[1:23:44] when I give my blood my the blood
[1:23:47] represents the life in the Old Testament
[1:23:49] the blood represents the life I want to
[1:23:51] give my life Hazard my life life give up
[1:23:55] my life risk my life sacrifice my life
[1:23:58] so I can get to that original water at
[1:24:00] Bethlehem so that I can bring that water
[1:24:03] in me back to
[1:24:06] him so that that water becomes so sacred
[1:24:10] the only one that can receive that drink
[1:24:13] offering is the Lord
[1:24:15] himself may my life be poured out as an
[1:24:19] offering to my
[1:24:22] Lord he wants a drink
[1:24:25] friends you don't have
[1:24:28] to you can go to heaven if all you want
[1:24:30] to do to go to heaven you can go to
[1:24:36] heaven but if you want to be the
[1:24:39] bride you better start dipping
[1:24:43] water start giving up
[1:24:46] sacrificing start watering the camel
[1:24:49] because that's the power that's going to
[1:24:51] carry us
[1:24:53] there if if we want to be the bride if
[1:24:55] we want to be the
[1:24:57] elected not that we have to you don't
[1:24:59] have
[1:25:00] to listen Rebecca didn't have to and
[1:25:03] those three Mighty Men didn't have to
[1:25:05] they wanted
[1:25:09] to and I'm not even telling you this so
[1:25:11] that you go to a bitter Works program
[1:25:13] and you give up whatever entertainment
[1:25:15] you were doing and then force yourself
[1:25:17] to read the message instead of watching
[1:25:19] YouTube amen that's just your own
[1:25:20] efforts that'll amount to nothing
[1:25:24] it's got to go deeper than that it's got
[1:25:26] to be a pouring out our
[1:25:28] life a surrendering our life because we
[1:25:31] want to not because we have to not
[1:25:35] because the church is pushing me into it
[1:25:38] not because this is the standard of the
[1:25:40] people I'm around not for acceptance
[1:25:42] amongst a group of Believers not so that
[1:25:44] I can look like I'm in the message that
[1:25:46] amounts to nothing
[1:25:48] friends at the end of the day that's all
[1:25:50] for
[1:25:52] you who's going to give him a drink
[1:25:54] offering who's going to sacrifice for
[1:25:56] him who's going to give up their own
[1:25:58] ideas about this message I don't want my
[1:26:00] ideas about this message I want the
[1:26:01] purity of the
[1:26:04] word who will sacrifice themselves and
[1:26:08] so that that drink
[1:26:09] offering becomes
[1:26:12] equivalent to our
[1:26:16] life that's the only
[1:26:18] sacrifice worth giving back to the
[1:26:22] Lord is when this water is equivalent to
[1:26:25] our life when we've sacrificed
[1:26:28] surrendered given all because we wanted
[1:26:32] to I don't know about you I don't know
[1:26:34] if I'll ever be as good as those three I
[1:26:37] don't know if I'll ever be as quick on
[1:26:39] the trigger I don't know if I'll ever
[1:26:41] respond as fast I don't know if I'll
[1:26:43] I'll be as brave but I want to be I want
[1:26:46] to be like I don't know that I can
[1:26:48] endure and what Rebecca endured to get
[1:26:50] over 2,000 lbs of water I don't know
[1:26:52] that I wouldn't be tempted to quit or
[1:26:54] say that's good enough or look there's
[1:26:56] still a little water in the trough and
[1:26:57] Chase the camels away
[1:26:59] and I don't know I still have a human
[1:27:02] side friends I still have a carnal
[1:27:04] nature I'm fighting with but what I want
[1:27:06] from the bottom of my heart is water
[1:27:08] till all the camels are done
[1:27:10] drinking and if it's 2,000 lb of water
[1:27:12] if it's 4,000 lbs of water I want to
[1:27:15] keep pouring out my life surrendering my
[1:27:17] energy giving my time till all the word
[1:27:20] is fulfilled till all the word is
[1:27:23] satisfied
[1:27:25] I want to Hazard my life and risk my
[1:27:27] life and risk my safety risk my security
[1:27:30] risk my
[1:27:32] future so that our David The Fugitive
[1:27:35] King in this church
[1:27:37] age can have the drink of the original
[1:27:39] water from the well at
[1:27:41] Bethlehem there's a fountain open we
[1:27:44] know where it's
[1:27:45] at the question is will we cut through
[1:27:49] the Garrison of
[1:27:50] Philistines to get him that water
[1:27:55] I believe the bride will I know she will
[1:27:58] she's predestinated to it's his life in
[1:28:01] her it's his will in her it's his
[1:28:03] predestinated plan it's the word in her
[1:28:05] fulfilling the word for the
[1:28:08] hour she's going to cut through her own
[1:28:12] desire she's going to cut through her
[1:28:13] own thinking her own preferences her own
[1:28:16] way she likes things to be cut through
[1:28:18] her own tradition her own family history
[1:28:21] her own church
[1:28:22] history she she is she's going to cut
[1:28:25] through her own desire she's going to
[1:28:26] cut through
[1:28:27] everything to get back to the
[1:28:30] original and she's going to be full of
[1:28:33] that water and she's going to become The
[1:28:34] Well of Living Water cuz he said this

[1:28:40] Fountain of Living Water on this Earth

[1:28:43] be offering it back to him as a drink
