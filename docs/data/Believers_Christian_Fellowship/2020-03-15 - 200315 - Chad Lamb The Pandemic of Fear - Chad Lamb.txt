exciting announcement i'd like to announce an engagement of josiah mcnulty and zoe greeley can you two stand up boris please praise the lord it says here josiah mcnulty and zoe greeley are pleased to announce their engagement that took place on january 24th so we're just getting caught up this has been going on for a while and it's been a long distance courtship so we've we've lost josiah quite a bit but we've gained zoe on occasion so it's been good so it took place on the 24th the wedding will be in north carolina at the end of may there will be a brighter bridal shower for them on april 18th in the fellowship hall at 2pm sign up sheets for the shower will be posted on the bulletin board so everything is going to start happening fast so make sure you get signed up for that and support

stand please [Applause] amen where he's going what a good day two in one day amen you know they did a good job at being discreet in their courtship so there's many people surprised today but that's the way they chose to do it and and that was good we thank god for that and i believe emily's dad aaron is here god bless you it's good to have you here with us as well so it's an exciting day it seems as though the world is falling apart but the bride just keeps moving on we're happy and we're a free people you know we're not going to come under the same anxiety and the same fears the rest of the world why because we have a heavenly father who watches over us you know that that brother branham quoted that uh a couple of times in the message where the one robin and the or one bird in the garden said to another bird why do these people run about and are so anxious and the one bird looks to the other and says it must be that they have no heavenly father that watches over them like you and i you know when when everything's falling apart and news is coming out fast and i opened the the curtains on the patio door and i looked out and there's two little squirrels eating out of the bird feeder and uh you can't convince them the world's falling apart they're happy why because they have a god who takes care of them amen let's all stand and we'll read a scripture together at a second timothy so yeah i never thought i'd see the day my son is engaged i was hoping that we'd all be in new bodies in a new place by now he may have had other wishes but this my wishes we'd all go up in a bunch together but god has a plan and we're excited for them proud of them and man it's good to see our young people growing up i remember josiah when we first moved up here he was the little guy eight nine years old helping us mow grass and help me work on a fence and now he's getting married he's got his own house and my own son time moves fast i remember old people talking like this so and i was like that's old people talk and now i'm starting to use old people talk i don't like it amen praise the lord also kyle mentioned it but remember this wednesday he and his family and the seven of our young people will be traveling up and then talk to a couple of the parents and kyle and everybody feels free in their heart to continue on and i said well just keep moving forward and if god closes the door god closes the door but if not he's got a purpose there's no reason for us to figure things out we need to be led by the spirit of god also thursday on the 19th myself my wife and myself and the young adults will be going to the young adults retreat over in indiana so remember that in prayer we'll be back saturday evening but brother john kadeem is going to be preaching for us this sunday so i'm sure he would covet your prayers and appreciate you remembering him as well man let's look at second timothy chapter one and let's look at verse seven second timothy 1 7 for god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and love and of a sound mind let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for all that you have given to us and we thank you for your provision for us lord we just ask now that you would begin to speak to us lord by your provided way we've come in obedience to your word and we've come expecting to hear from you and i pray god that you would take these lips of clay that you would take control and you would speak your eternal words give us all ears to hear and a heart to perceive all you have for us in this day we give ourselves to you and ask you take preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you all can be seated amen i took for a subject today the pandemic of fear for obvious reasons we just want to talk about the pandemic of fear because this is we're coming to showdown time we're moving into proving time and the cycles brother benham taught us in birth pains that that when he preached birth pains he preached birth pains after he declared judgment striking beginning at the west coast and and you know he was the one who initiated that cycle and after he initiated that cycle there was an earthquake in uh in alaska in the following year there's one in seattle and brother bam started showing us it was the beginning of the cycle of the end of the destruction of the earth preparing it for a millennium but when he preached birth pains he shows that all these contractions they they get closer together and more intense that's it's time for the baby to be born and he begins to speak that way about this this earth this earth is groaning in travail because it's going to bring forth a bright new world for a millennium and the earth now you know you see the timing uh the birth pains increasing in intensity and the contractions getting closer together it tells you that the baby's coming the baby's coming the baby's coming amen and before the baby can come the bride has to get a translation and go to a wedding supper so actually the severity of the contractions the intensity and the frequency is an indication of the ripeness of the seed when we see these things happening amen it says look up for thy redemption draw us nigh it is it is it is showing it's not that the bride is catching up with the earth the earth is catching up with the bride amen it's god's work in his people that's moving everything so it's exciting this is an exciting time to be alive let's turn to second peter i want to read quite a few scriptures here so keep your bibles handy let's go to second peter ii peter chapter 3 verse 1. ii peter 3 and 1 the second epistle beloved i i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which are spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust so i read this to show you he he's he's stirring up in your pure minds by way of remembrance all that was written the things i'm going to talk about today are nothing new we know these scriptures we know these quotes we know this but i want to take the opportunity to stir up your pure minds by remembrance because we're human beings and human beings you know and the greatest battle ever fought is fought between our ears all of our battles are mind battles and we've got to keep the word forefront in our minds all the time because there's always other messages trying to get their way into our mind amen and and if you're like me the messages have been coming hard and fast in the last few days through the news and we need to hear the true report because what you're hearing on the news is not the true report but this word is the true report and we need to pay attention amen and make sure that we're feeding on the word that we're listening to the message that we're hearing the true report those things that will build faith in time of trouble amen and so we stir up in your minds by way of your pure minds by way of remembrance what has been written brother menom said in the message be not afraid it says now i want to take a subject to take a subject for this testimony meaning of be not afraid there's two elements that control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear the other is faith now it's either faith fear or faith controls every nation every denomination every individual you're either fear or faith that controls you and my question is this morning what controls you fear of faith amen because you know we we live we live on this earth and we live in bodies amen that are susceptible that are fallen a mind that is corrupt amen but there's something on the inside amen there's faith that comes from god himself god's own faith is laying there ready to be released in the time of need amen and it takes the word of god it takes the light of the hour amen to shine on that and encourage you it takes the holy ghost to keep bringing those things out but it's there amen and what is going to control us is it going to be the outer man or the inner man what are we going to be controlled by because the outer man can be swayed amen by my winds of of news and troubles and all kinds of things can sway the outer man but the inner man has an anchor that's tied to a rock and that's a revelation in the word and it's not going to move amen oh i get excited in one week the world has changed for us all my life and it's not been that long i have never seen what i've seen in one week in this country i remember having a conversation with brother frank i'm going to throw him under the bus but we would have conversations over the last couple years and i said you know brother franco things are going to change they're not going to stay this way there's going to be a persecution the things brother ben said is going to happen things are not going to stay the way they are and brother franco says i know you say that brother chad but how i don't see it how can things change that fast and i kept saying things can fall like dominoes they can change fast and he said how so i think it was friday thursday or friday he comes in my office he goes brother chad he was ready to repent because now you see things can change faster than we ever imagined what the world is realizing is the whole system is fragile [Applause] it's not solid it's not stable everything that we thought was tangible and solid and unmovable with things that we begin to rely on like paychecks and account balances and government help and we're beginning to realize that these things were fragile but we knew they were fragile we knew they were temporal we knew the word of god tells us not to put our confidence in the things of man not to lean to the arm of flesh god has already told us this these things but now he's allowing us to see just how fragile this whole system is the whole thing is propped up by popsicle sticks and we feel so safe and so secure because the traffic lights work and the streets are paved and but just in a moment's time a matter of a few weeks you knock out a couple popsicle sticks and you realize the whole thing can collapse and the world is gripped in fear brother of them told us years ago america is whistling in the graveyard trying to convince themselves that they're not scared and everything's fine well nobody's whistling in the graveyard now and it's just the tip of the iceberg this is just the beginning there's more to come so so for me all my life there's been a certain steadiness a certain stability i mean as much as my life went up and down there were certain things that stayed fast stayed concrete stayed steady around but now we're reeling you can't put confidence in any of those things there's only one thing that we can have confidence in and that's god himself everything else will be shaken everything else will be shaken down amen but god and god is his word is going to be unmovable unshaking and it's the rock that we can run to it's the it's the it's the place it's the strong tower that we can run to and the time of trouble and we will be perfectly completely safe amen we will not be motivated by fear we will not you know we will not uh we will not follow the pattern of the world in the time of calamity because we don't need to amen we've got a god who's promised and made precious promises that belong to us and we're not going to forfeit those promises to take care of ourselves amen we're going to let him take care of us because he said he would let's look at when we looked here at second timothy 1 7 we don't have to turn back we're going to go to romans next but it says he has not given us the spirit of fear so you realize fear is a spirit and because it's a spirit it can be resisted like any other spirit can be resisted like the spirit of lust or the spirit of greed or the spirit of anger or all these other spirits that try to cause us to fall cause us to go to error speak things that are wrong and do things that are wrong those are all spirits that are trying to motivate us but fear is a spirit amen if we've watched the news we've watched the world amen come under the grip of the spirit of fear there's a spirit of fear on the world amen but there should be no spirit of fear in the bride and when you feel that thing coming in like a wave we need to be able to say satan i resist you in the name of jesus christ because it's a spirit we can cast off spirits we can resist spirits we can bind spirits we don't have to give in to spirits and if we give in to spirits amen will be overcome by the spirit so we we have to give the spirit a position amen and we choose not to give it a position we actively choose not to allow the spirit of fear to influence our mind amen we bring every thought captive to the obedience of christ every thought every thought that comes through our mind we have to be judges of these thoughts because there's a spirit of fear running rampant out there that will try to bring thoughts into our mind and brother bam said you can't stop him from putting thoughts in your mind but you don't let the birds build a nest in your hair and when the thought comes you say that thought is contrary to the scriptures that is contrary to what my lord has told me amen i don't have to fear this i don't have to fear that and i don't have to worry about this everything's going to be okay why because he told me everything's going to be okay in fact he told me all these things are coming already he told me in the scriptures and he told me in the message and he's already told me so this is what we've been expecting we've been expecting this and more [Applause] so when it comes there's all of a sudden from fear faith has this little tremor on the inside there's an expectation there's an excitement on the inside and the bride amen that excitement is why because the word's coming to pass any time the words coming to pass it's an enthusiastic thing for the bride she's excited we're not excited because people are suffering we're not excited because of difficult circumstances we're excited because he told us this would be here and he told us these would be the conditions like this and more amen as we get closer and closer to our to our rescue and when you see the word of god advancing something inside says praise god i'm excited let's go to romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 and verse 14. for as many as they're led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god if you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear because that a spirit of bondage was to fear but we've been released from that that fear brings a bondage you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit of self-bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so this spirit that comes to witness in us that we are the children of god is we've got a different spirit not one to bring us back to bondage again of fear but one that liberates us to the realization we're sons of god and joint heirs with christ and if i be a son of god and a joint heir of christ what do i have to fear what do i have to worry about because if i'm a joint heir of christ everything that belongs to christ also belongs to me and every privilege that's extended to christ is also extended to me all protection and all provision in all things amen that has been delivered to him i'm also a joint heir and i'm also a son of god amen how many sons of god does god lose how many sons of god does he not provide for how many sons of god amen does he lose in the shuffle losing the mix and lose track of see this spirit is what brings peace to us to realize that there's nothing to be afraid of i have a heavenly father who watches over me amen and he's made promises in his word i don't have to worry about it all i have to do is believe let's go to hebrews chapter 2. hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage this was the bondage that was talking about in romans because of fear of death amen there is subject to bondage but there is now no fear and death in fact if you would die right now it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to you because you would instantly go to the sixth dimension and be rejoicing in the place that brother branham said so instantly now there's no more fear and death and brother branham said in the message it is the rising of the sun but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything i'm an abstract holder then amen and as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract deed that i'm part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of word live out just exactly like it did in him he as he promised in the last days the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that god given me by grace by foreign knowledge oh my what are you scared about no wonder he said fear not i am he that was dead and alive again and i'm alive forevermore and have the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even death ain't going to hurt you what are you scared about he he he purchased back through shedding of his own blood redemption all that adam lost amen all that mankind lost in the fall has been purchased back and now he's laid claim of the title deed book and he's done more than that through his seventh church age messenger he sent it down to his bride remember where the title deed book went yes it went down amen to the hands of a seventh church age messenger who gave it out to the bride amen and when john went and took that book he ate the book that means the title deed book is in the bride all the inheritance lost is restored everything that was given up is come back every provision amen the blood that purchased us back and paid the price of redemption and erased our sins is the same one that takes care of the effect of sin and sickness is the effect of sin everything that's in a fallen condition is an effect of sin and when he paid the price for sin he paid the price for all the effects of sin and now we have a way where we can overcome all the effects of sin even death so what are you scared about let's go to first john first john chapter four first john chapter 4 and verse 17. hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment this is a judgment day we're in a season of judgment here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world what are you scared about as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us it's a revelation of predestination it's an understanding of we were part of him we were in him we were with him in the beginning we belong to him we've come out from him we love him because he first loved us it's the revelation of predestination that settles our heart if he predestinated us and he placed us here all things are in his control furthermore brother branham says i'm going to find this quote i've got to skip ahead of ways in the super sign 1963 he says god knowed the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes god is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time is it yes and when you see the clock tick a stroke and you say i've never seen this before it's right on time it's right perfect sometimes we get weary upset we get hasty we think oh we must do this or do that but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his knowledge god doesn't predestinate by his desire he's not willing that any should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day bring this home right now today to this sunday morning amen in 2020 he knew that we would live in this day he knew this would be our day he had plans for this day he has had plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he is always on time hey who put you here did who put you here amen you come amen in spiritual amnesia with no with no no choice in this life that i would be placed here in this time he placed you here by his predestination you're here in this time and it's not that god didn't know the challenges that we would be facing in this time we didn't quite understand the challenges we'd even be facing this last week just because it escaped our understanding and foresight didn't mean it ever escaped his and he chose you to be here now and if he chose you to be here now then he's put inside of you exactly what you need amen to overcome in this place now today under the current conditions or all conditions in worse conditions the most horrible of conditions he placed you here now and if he placed you here now he's got confidence in that attribute that he's placed inside of you and he knows that it'll overcome he knows it so there's no fear in those things see whatever i face he foresaw whatever i have to walk through he foresaw any and within me he placed within me all that i need and he sent his word in due season to quicken it out of me praise be to god i'm so glad amen when god was making the earth when he was first forming the earth he was laying out the ingredients for your body so his foresight is unmeasurable he says brother brother man said god doesn't run his business like you and i or some others would run it just haphazardly amen but like a contractor he would lay out so many two by fours and so many of this and so much of that because he knew what material would take to build the house and he laid it all out ahead of time and god did that when he created this world to take your body out of he already foresaw you standing here now and put the ingredients in the earth whenever the earth was formed however many billions and millions or whatever years ago your body was laying here then and he ordained it to come to manifestation in this hour to meet the need of the hour that's why he said a super race because it's going to be super bad super trouble super bugs super disturbances super bad news just so there'd be a super race here to meet it predestinated for this hour remember friend we've been no matter what the news report says you've been predestinated for this hour and if you weren't you would have manifested in another hour but you're the seed of god the children of god the part of god amen remember it's not just you this flesh that we're talking about this flesh can get troubled this flesh can get nervous amen but it's the peace of god on the inside and when god parted himself out he placed so many of himself with certain characteristics to meet the need of each day but there was a portion he had to hold back for the last day because it's a part of his nature it's a part of his makeup it's a part of himself that he wants to be displayed in a certain way at a certain time and that's the part that's in you and i and god will not be defeated by anything that's coming nothing will defeat god hallelujah friends with that being said the news gets exciting it's not fearful it's exciting because the news is only responding to the life on the inside god god desires to prove himself it's his desire to prove himself he's been building and maturing and building and maturing amen this seed because he wants to prove it god's not afraid of the test are you god's not afraid of the test don't let anybody make you afraid of the test because god's not afraid he wasn't afraid to send the three hebrew children to the fiery furnace he wasn't afraid of the test and they finally got to the point amen they said god our god is more than able they didn't know what was going to happen they couldn't predict what was going to happen they couldn't presume it was going to happen but they knew one thing our god is more than able to deliver us from this but if he doesn't i'll still die standing on his word i'll believe him to the bitter end and if i die i die a believer i'm not going to die fearful a coward bowing down trying to make some sort of appeasement to the politics amen so that i can spare my natural life a little longer no they were willing to they were willing to give it all for the word of god and if they die they die it's always a word test friends it wasn't they god wasn't afraid to put them to that test because he knew what was in him he wasn't afraid to put job to the test because he knew it was in job god knew the outcome he wasn't going to lose a son but there were some things he wanted to teach job and some things he wanted to prove to satan and he was accomplishing both at the same time and there's some things he wants to teach us and some things he wants to prove to the devil and he's going to do both at the same time let's go to psalms 27. i'm still trying to lay a foundation i like the foundation oh i can't help but be excited i can't help it no matter no matter what i just can't help but be excited psalms 27 verse 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall arise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide in me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide in me this is the inner chamber friends this is back to the bedroom in the inner and the of the inner and the holy of the holies in the pavilion and the seek in the secret of his tabernacle let's keep reading for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in this pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide in me he shall set me up upon a rock what's that rock the revelation of god the revelation of the word and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies around about me why because of revelation set me on a rock and my head's lifted up because of revelation why is it my head's lifted up above all my enemies everybody else is going crazy and losing their minds amen but the bride's not because she's been lifted up in revelation she understands who she is who god is and what the relationship between the two is and what the word says about the hour we live in her head is lifted up above her enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises to the lord in the time of trouble the wicked gathered about foes around about desiring to eat up his flesh armies and camped around about him in the time of trouble what's he going to do because he set up on a rock because he's in the inner chamber because he's on a rock of revelation because his head is lifted up by revelation he will sing with joy happiness not not downtrodden not nervous not but happy and joyful because we're tucked away in christ i was when i was thinking on this i was i was reflecting back on the biography i read of john wesley one time and john wesley was an anglican minister and he decided that he was going to evangelize the native american indians so he took a boat ride a ship across the atlantic to come over to georgia to evangelize the indians and on that boat ride a terrible storm came up and he writes about in this diary you can go read it in his diary but a storm comes up and the ship was tossed about and i believe the sail was torn or the mast was broken i saw it was a really terrible storm and he said there was a group of christians on there called the moravians and if you read about moravians they were the real deal they were the real christians of the day amen you can follow their lineage all the way through they're the ones who resisted the catholic church and the waldenses all the way through you can find this true strain of christians and that was the moravians in that day and it says during the storm they began to sing joyfully to the lord they were singing in the midst of the storm they're singing joyfully to the lord well everybody else is terrified and he said a great wave comes over the top of the of the ship and breaks over the ship and starts running down the boards in the deck amen and flooding the bottom and he said oh he called them in his journal he calls them the germans the moravians and he says the english were screaming and the moravians were singing joyfully and they kept when the wave broke over they kept singing praises to the lord and john wesley asked one of the moravian ministers one of the men and he says why aren't you afraid he says he said aren't you afraid he says thank god no he says what about your women and children he said our women and children aren't afraid to die that was the thing that turned john wesley's heart he had never been converted yet anglican minister never been converted and he realized he was terrified and he didn't have what they had they had something in the face of trouble they had something in the face of death that he was lacking amen he went down to georgia and it was a disaster it didn't work out good they practically ran him out comes back and in his journal entry he says i went to save the indians in america but who would save john wesley realize he'd never been converted but what was the thing that turned his heart when he saw in the face of trouble when he saw in the face of a pending doom possible death amen he saw that there was no fear no fear and death but there was a joyful singing to the lord praises and songs of joy and gratitude why because they had something real on the inside that says if this is my last breath let me go singing his praises if this is the last thing i get to do on this planet let me lift a joyful noise into the lord amen i i want so bad for that to be my testimony i went if it's my last breath on earth it's the last action i take please don't let it be curled up in a ball in the corner under the bed but let it be singing praises oh god i thank you and i love you for what you've done and what you're doing why because it's coming to showdown time because everything's moving into extremes i mean there's the middle ground is disappearing all over the place and we're moving into extremes to the place where now amen you you can you can almost slip through society unnoticed in many ways but that day is coming to an end when they see you smiling in the grocery store when everybody else is frantic to get as many things as they can possibly get in their cart and you're going up to the toilet paper and there's one pack left you see the lady she's making a beeline and you back up and say go ahead you realize fear is gripping the people but there's got to be a people who begin to rise and shine for thy light has come not fearful not grabbing not taking not but just trusting my father will take care of me you realize in lima ohio people have emptied the shelves they've gone to walmart gone to meyer gone to aldi and have emptied the shelves and not one of them is sick or know somebody who's sick not one of them but scared terrified completely terrified say god help me never get into that condition you know what i want to do i want to take god at his word i think god's giving us opportunities to take him at his word and i think the opportunities will get better matthew 14 and 22. and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto him walking unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out in fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid so many times we see these circumstances rise up in tumultuous situations and storms and it's just god trying to come to us and it's trying to reveal something to us and he could say the same thing today it's i be not afraid what about this virus in this plague what about this it's i be not afraid can't you see my hand can't you see me working in this can't you see me furthering my kingdom it's i be not afraid be of good cheer go back to psalms 27 i will rejoice with joy and sing praises to the lord win in the midst of trouble and trouble sometimes with foes gathered about i will sing joy amen in the middle of the storm amen they were crying and fearful and thought they would die and he says be of good cheer it is i be not afraid i'd like to say the same thing to you today be of good cheer it's him this is him this is his hand this is his word don't start saying oh the devil this and the devil that god's got his fingerprint all over this what's god doing god is taken a chaos in our hearts and by the bright light of the word of the hour he has turned the chaos in our lives into a garden of eden but now he's taking satan's eden and turning it into chaos it's moving in the opposite direction of the bride the bride's going up satan's kingdom's coming down the bride is coming to peace amen saint zine is going into chaos it's a there's an exact reflection in the opposite of what's going on be of a good cheer at his eye be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus it's working the word is working he said if a jew bid me come jesus said come that's the word of the lord and the word is working amen peter is standing on the water not by physical properties he's standing on the word the word is holding him up because jesus said come and the word is working praise god and while the word is working he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said in him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt the word was working the word was working perfect but he looked at the conditions and got his eyes off of the thing that was working and when he looked at the conditions he began to sink and jesus tells us why he's saying he said why did you doubt the word works by faith but doubt destroys it when he began to doubt he began to go down said god help us help us we've seen the word work how many seen the word work you've seen the word in your life hold you up heal your body deliver you from trouble you've seen the word work over and over and over again now don't look at the boisterous waves and the and the contrary wind don't look to anything else but the very thing that caused you to walk through the previous circumstances will cause you to walk through the next don't look around amen keep focused on this word believe the true report you know the news is not going to help your faith and whenever things happen we become news junkies i put myself in the same mix what's happening you know you know things aren't changing week by week hour by hour but you're looking at vanities and lying vanities and circumstances i'm not saying shouldn't watch the news that's not the point the point is if you stay there and you don't feed on the word if you don't stay in fellowship with the brethren if you don't stay feeding in prayer and feeding on the word of god listening to the message reading your bible in prayer communing with the lord you are going to become overwhelmed by the circumstances we've got it's fine to check the news this is we live in an hour where you better check it you know but you know what if the internet access went off tomorrow and you wake up and the sun's shining and the birds are singing and you got no news feed telling you things are bad you'd have a hard time believing it i like to be like that little squirrel [Applause] i found some corn in this feeder i would have one corn say what one one squirrel says to the next squirrel uh what if it runs out those people keep filling it up and if the feeder goes dry he'll go back to the forest god's made a provision the squirrel's not worried why are we worried [Music] the bird can still sing in the morning why can't we we should have a greater revelation than the bird the bird doesn't have a soul we should have greater faith we should wake up singing we should wake up with a song on our heart we should be merry and cheerful because everything we've ever longed for is coming to pass everything our hearts have ever desired amen as we're moving into the cycle we're beginning to see things that we've never seen before amen it's going to bring about amen this cycle plus more and more or however or however long i don't know i don't care but watching things change amen in just a matter of weeks is the most thrilling thing that i've ever experienced in my life amen because we've read the word and we've listened to the message and we've preached it but now we're seeing it [Applause] that's why you go to the grocery store no bread that's okay why is it okay because if i run out of bread i know somebody who can break bread and make more bread there's nothing to be afraid of [Applause] amen and even if there's no bread i know one who can say speak to the squirrels and create where there's nothing [Applause] there's nothing to be afraid of you walk down amen they're out of this that's okay they're out of this that's okay they're out of this where are you gonna get it i don't know but i don't need to know because the word promises me i've never seen the righteous forsaking or god's seed begging for bread why can't i expect him to come on the scene remember the worst of times brought the greatest miracles [Music] we want to see the hand of god moving miraculous ways part the red sea if you were there the day the red sea parted you would have been you would have been in a tumultuous storm your emotions would have been running rampant they would run they freed from the freed from the slavery free from bondage freed from the egypt and now they're in the exodus journey playing tambourines and singing amen and moving along a great company and the pillar of fire leading them everything is perfect amen they've went through the trial in egypt they've been rescued out according to the word of god and that pillar of fire that holy ghost leads them right to a death trap no way to escape no way out but they had no idea that the scripture said the eternal word of god says his ways are in the water his path is in the sea they didn't know but god had already laid a path through the red sea just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there i don't see how this is going to work that don't mean a thing i don't see how i'm going to get out of this jam that doesn't mean anything just because you see it doesn't mean it's not there the eternal word of god says his ways are in the waters path is in the sea he had a path in the red sea and nobody knew it but him and but when it was the right time amen when everything when everything got impossible now begin to cry amen and moses doesn't know what to say but he says you just just listen you're going to see the hand of god move and this army fairs over you'll see it no more but everybody said he had no idea what was going to happen but he knew one thing god had said you take this people and bring him back to this mountain somehow he had to get to that mountain and somehow the bride's got to get through every one of these obstacles the bride's got to overcome everything that we're going to face how i don't know how but just because i can't see it amen they may freeze your bank account money may crash to nothing it's happened in other countries recently i don't see how i'm going to do this praise god that means you're you're you are set for a miracle it's no longer wringing our hands and worrying about how this is going to happen but the bride has got to come to the place in faith in the word of god when we get to a place where it's impossible then we start to believe for the impossible and all of a sudden from fear it turns to anticipation saying i can't see how oh this is good i can't wait to see what he's going to do now because we're in a pickle now lord we're sharing a fix now lord you realize you're never going at it alone i'll be with you in you to the end of the world it's you and him together you're not doing this by yourself why are you going to deliver now i don't know but his ways are past finding out one of the greatest miracles this world has ever seen is the parting of the red sea but it come at one of the greatest times of trouble in peril we should be excited whatever happens next god's in control whatever happened yesterday he was in control whatever's happening now he's in control whatever happens tomorrow he's in control i've given him my life i'm not going to take it back start running it myself i don't know where that path in the sea is he does you understand i don't know where to cast a line to pull out the fish with the coin in its mouth he does he knows there's a fish there with a coin in its mouth and he knows just when to tell peter peter you know it's time to pay taxes we ain't got no money jesus didn't start looking at the the newspaper or we don't do newspapers anymore he didn't go to the internet job post and say i need to get a second job because he had a heavenly father and he was there in commission we've been commissioned to be here this day if there's needs we can't meet then god's obligated to meet them he may do it by giving us work that's wonderful we'll do it but we don't need to start making provisions for ourselves god will provide he's promised to provide why that's such a neat story about that fish in the coin's mouth it came at a time of need and it came through somebody who believed that god would meet the need so he told peter go cast the line in now's the time go cast a line pull out the fish and in this mouth you'll find a coin praise be to god i can't wait to hear the testimonies that are going to be coming soon i can't wait to hear what god's going to do for you and for me and for all of us in our individual circumstances i'm excited to see what god will do i think we're going to see we wanted to see we've wanted to see what what we've been told would happen all of our lives we've been wanting to see greater manifestation we've been wanting to see it and you can't manufacture it you can't make things happen you can't manufacture it but when it's god's time and when god wants to show himself mighty amen he says he sets the circumstances so perfectly that only he can get the credit he puts things in such an order that no man can glory and no man can share in his glory that nobody can point to themselves god gets it so impossible and so difficult amen and so beyond human ability that when he does it everybody says that's god [Applause] and that's what we want that's what we're looking for that's what we're longing for but we got to be willing to go through the press to get to the miracle we've got to be willing to go amen before peter could ever witness an angel opening prison doors he had to get in prison [Music] before they ever witnessed jesus breaking bread and multiplying creation they had to get to a place where there's no way to feed this crowd we're out in the wilderness the people will faint along the way we're in an impossible situation we send them home they're going to be dying we don't have enough money to buy enough food we're out here in the wilderness when he got to the need then he supplied the need don't be afraid to get a need [Applause] now don't put yourself in need so i'm gonna rack up all my credit cards right now and the system will crumble and god will take care of me no we gotta act like christians all the way through but don't be afraid praise the lord mark 4. mark 4 35 in the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over to the other side key phrase let's hold on to that phrase key phrase let us pass over to the other side you know what that is that's the word of the lord so he just gave them the word of the lord let us pass over to the other side all right and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with them other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the the waves beat unto the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow i don't think he was worried asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish what an accusation do you see what fear does fear causes us to blame god instead of turning to god in faith and saying god i trust you in this storm but fear will turn you say god why did you let this happen what a horrible statement to make what a terrible thing to say to god of all creation how dare we as human beings turn to an almighty righteous and perfect god and say god how could you let this happen my goodness he does everything perfect he does everything right amen they should have never looked at jesus and said don't you care that we perish what a horrible thing to say to the lord of glory the one who had provided for them the one who had taken care of them the one who instructed them but you see how deadly fear is it'll have you making accusations against god instead of operating by faith and say god i trust you and i know your word says and in every situation i'm going to trust in you because you're the mighty god because you're the all-powerful one because you've done greater things than this in the past and i'm standing on you because you're big you're strong you're powerful you're mighty not you're unjust and you're uncaring and you're unfeeling you see the difference we've got to grow up and quit being children we've got to start acting like a bride amen the bride who's come to full maturity and quit acting like little kids throwing accusations towards god god is perfect in all of his ways and everything has to be this way the clock is ticking right on time when we get in trouble let's just cry out to his majesty let's acknowledge his glory let's recite all the things he's done for us in the past let's talk about all the wonder let's speak back to god all the wonderful things he's done for us and all that he means to us and how perfect and beautiful he is and all that he's done through the ages and all that he's done in the bible i'm telling you we'll get somewhere we'll get a whole lot farther than crying out saying god why did you do this and why did you do that and what yes sir we need to repent for that kind of praying [Applause] they said charist thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith he's asking a question because they've already seen miracles they've already seen him speak and it happens speak and it happens they've seen him heal the sick they seen him do all these things and now they come to a great crisis in their life and they have stay they go back to amnesia and forgot everything that they've seen him do and they start to say how is it that you don't even care about us my he already gave you his word and he said let us pass to the other side nothing was going to stop that boat from getting to the other side because the lord said let us us us i would include myself and us when he said let us pass to the other side if i'm in that boat today i said he promised me i'm getting to the other side because i'm part of us there's got to come a spiritual maturity where we can take the word that way he said if he said let us pass i'm as safe as if he gets there i get there he's going to go there i'm going to stay next to him i might just lay down next to him because all my efforts are not working the boat's still filling up i can't bail it fast enough i can't row it fast enough i can't fight the wind there's nothing else i can do i might as well rest with him because he said let us pass to the other side i'm part of us and we're going to the other side it's not my responsibility to keep water out of the boat i've done all i can do i can't do any more you see god gets us to places where we've done all that we can do we can't do any more that's when he shows up on the scene but let's go to him in faith let's go to next time we have a need a deep need something difficult we're facing why don't we go to him and start saying god you healed the leper you opened the blinded eyes you healed me when i was sick you fed me and clothed me all these years you've given me a home and you give me a family and you've watched over me i've never lacked a thing in my life that's your great provision why is it we forget the breaking of bread why is it we forget the healing why is it we forget all that he's ever done we've got to grow up we've got to be mature this is a different season in a different time and he ordained you to be here childish things are not going to work anymore it's over with it's time for maturity says in awakening jesus could you imagine job enjoying being broke out with boils and all these things losing all of his wealth and his children and everything it wasn't very easy but god was proving to satan that he had somebody he could put confidence in maybe he's trying to do the same thing in your case and the rest of you oh they'll forsake you oh no job they couldn't make job do that no sir he's only trying to prove them remember in a few minutes he said oh ye of little faith couldn't you understand about the breaking the bread and feeding 5000 don't you know i'm the same jehovah that fed them for 40 years out there in the wilderness out of ovens out of heaven when i poured it out every night what you so scared about don't you know i dried up the red sea one day don't you know i opened the earth and swallowed the unbeliever one day i measured the earth and spurred it off out in space yonder and he's the he's in the ship now that's not mythical that's the truth the same holy ghost who was brooding over the earth and took the word of god when it was spoken and brought it to pass brother brennan said he pulled up mountains and trees what was it the brooding of the holy ghost the same one that turned a judgment and chaos of a world into an eden that same holy ghost is in the bride he's in the boat the same one that brought to pass the full word of god in creation amen when we read it in genesis the same one is in the boat see same now he tries to prove us and see where we'll stand or not take a revival away start an argument in the church just to see what you'll do turn satan loose among you see how you'll stand let him strike you with something see what kind of stand you'll take job said though he slayed me yet i'll trust him amen that's it shadrach meshach and abednego our god is able to deliver us from the fire but nevertheless we will not give up praise be they're gone let's turn to job just want to look at a few more scriptures here let's look at job 3 job chapter 3. he lays down a fantastic principle out of job and the prophet comes and will read what he says about it job chapter 3 and verse 25 for the thing which i greatly feared has come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me lock that in your heart for the thing which i greatly feared has come upon me and that which i was afraid of has come unto me brother man says in perfect faith in the book of job it says here joke feared and what he what he feared it actually happened do you realize that there's a power of creation in the children of god there is a power of creation brother branham said inside of you if you are a seed of god inside of you is enough power to speak another world into existence and go live a private life on it but that power is controlled by faith you know there's a power brother man said you have a power to create an atmosphere around you that others can step in that power has been entrusted into the bride we've got to be careful how we use it because we can create a negative atmosphere just as much as a positive atmosphere and sometimes we get what we believe we believe it's not going to work out it's not going to work out if we believe we're going to be rejected we're going to be rejected if we believe amen we're going to get sick we're going to get sick i've seen it happen i've seen it in my own family somebody gets sick the other person's not sick but they start working they're going to say go to and you say you're not going to get sick you're going to be fine and next thing you know they're getting sick and there's nothing wrong with them and they started to worry and get fearful and get scared and they begin to manifest the thing they believed i've also seen them i've also seen the opposite happen one sec the other arms feeling saying oh god you're not sick you're fine everything's okay let's go do this and nothing ever happens we get what we believe let's make sure we believe the word what he feared it actually happened what brought it his fear what made it happen his fear what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him oh now's the time to say god take away my fears oh god rid me of this fear i denounce it you know and it's one thing uh i'll just i'll inject this here it's one thing to say god take away the fear take away the fear take away this but you realize that you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you gain this promised land is ours but we've got to fight for it and there's no longer going around fearful ringing your hands bringing your hands scared all the time and saying god take it away from me no you've got to fight for it you've got to actually do battle with the devil because that's a spirit of fear and you say well i've got anxiety anxiety is fear it's the same thing anxiety well i've got to say don't ever say you've got anxiety never ever say you've got anxiety or say i've heard people say well my anxiety is high you you just owned it you just claimed it as yours and laid claim to and say my anxiety don't have anxiety you don't have to have anxiety you don't have to live with anxiety you don't have to live with fear those things come from demons and we don't have to live with the influence of demons [Applause] but we've got to actually fight back according to the word and you say he's not given me the spirit of fear this is not this is not my portion this is not my life lord i'm not standing in line for this but but we've got to actually do battle with the devil and when you feel that anxious spirit coming on because it's not your anxiety it's an anxious spirit it's a demon spirit and when you feel that demon spirit getting close amen and those who've struggled with that you know what it's like when you feel that demon getting close and when you begin to feel like it's an inevitable conclusion it's inevitable i know the path this comes i get worried and fearful and i start to get depressed you don't have to go down the usual path anymore don't take it as an inevitable outcome when you start feeling this anxious demon say i recognize that's a devil and god has not given me the spirit of fear and i resist you satan in the name of jesus christ evoke the name of god stand on your privileges and on the promises give you and do battle with the devil don't just roll over and say oh my anxiety you're going to have it for the rest of your life if you talk like that and the whole time you'll be saying god take it away god take it away god take away but you're not doing what he told you to do amen to cast down reasoning that's what he told us to do not him to do he told us to cast down reasoning amen and bring every thought captive to the obedience of christ we don't just because it's a thought doesn't mean we have to dwell on it we're supposed to take that thing captive arrest it handcuff it and prison and bring it to the obedience of christ and say that thought does not match this word and i reject it in jesus name and i would say it out loud if you struggle with anxiety or fear i would say it out loud because there's fearful things moving upon the earth and if you don't conquer this now you're going to be overwhelmed by it now is the time to overcome overcome anxiety now is the time to overcome fear and it's a spiritual warfare [Applause] we've got to fight it with the word of god not think a happy thought i'll think anxiety's come i'm thinking of a happy place with daisies and little deer running around the field no we take the word of god which is the sword and we press it with a strong hand of faith to the heart of the enemy and we keep driving that word and driving that word and driving that word to the heart of the enemy it takes a strong hand of faith to say he said i don't have he has not given me the spirit of fear and i'm bringing this thought captive to the obedience of christ satan i reject you in jesus name now it's time to rise up with everything he could what more could be given to us we've got the whole book has been unsealed we've got the whole bible and we've been demonstrated before us on the wave sheep we know exactly what to do with the word we've seen it demonstrated we've heard it preached we've watched miracle after miracle you can listen to tape and prayer lines there is no excuse anymore friends for living in immaturity this is time to rise up [Applause] amen this is the time praise be to god but chad i there's no buts but my second there's no buts but you don't know god knows he wrote the word he made the provision if there's not something in this word to help you overcome then the word is failed if the spirit of god cannot deliver you then it's failed don't make excuses for your condition don't accept it it doesn't matter if you have to fight it every day it doesn't matter if you have to fight it every five minutes fight it fight it fight it until when until it's gone we've got this is a mighty marching army that this is not time to be children to be adults god had gave us a message 50 some years ago i mean how long are we going to wait how long is it going to take to come to maturity how long is it going to take to overcome the obstacles laid before us he didn't give us his word so we can be overcome he gave us the words for we could overcome doesn't mean things won't be hard things are supposed to be hard remember when it was time for a showdown on mount carmel god didn't look for an easy showdown they were in the time of drought they had problems they had false teaching the the nation was split between serving bao and serving god so he's going to have a showdown and he lets the 400 prophets go first and he's just got one prophet standing here he lets 400 against one god really likes those odds remember when he sent job to be the judge over israel to fight the battle and then they gathered all that they could gather and it was like 30 some thousand 32 or 33 000 people amen and it was it was a minuscule army compared to what they were fighting against but it was the best they can do and the first thing god says is there's too many here send home everybody who's afraid amen god doesn't need people he needs people who believe he doesn't need numbers he needs one person who can believe and that day he sent home everybody that was fearful and 22 000 leaves leaving like 10 000 or 11 000 people they lost two-thirds of their army [Applause] oh god's not afraid to be in the minority because god's always the majority he created everything amen he's in control of everything he just needs somebody to believe he doesn't need numbers amen he just needs somebody to take him at his word oh praise god amen let's go to psalms 91. oh i love the word of god can you see why satan wants to shut down churches because he knows what you know what he wants you to do we're to gather to provoke one another let's poke each other along to love and good works the forsaken not the assembling together of ourselves even the more so you see why you'd like to create scenarios that keep us from gathering together because it's an encouragement to the believers to stand on the word of god you know what he'd love to do shut it down send everybody back and give you free internet access to watch all the news you could watch binge on the news but don't come together to encourage each other in the word because the word will defeat all the lies of the enemy any place any time under any condition amen that's why we've got to gather together no matter what happens we have to gather together it's a scriptural mandate praise be to god psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty what other shadow do you want to be under i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler his what his truth shall be your shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten 000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee put this on your refrigerator put it on your phone screensaver whatever you need to do until this becomes part of your language only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil be fail thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling praise be to god you've got the word on it now let's just stand on the word and believe the word let's not be afraid remember god had secretly anointed a new king in israel and it was undercover it was just in one family and one house only the members of that family witnessed it and he anointed he had anointed little david king over israel and david knew and his brothers knew it but his brothers probably had some doubts samuel wasn't doubting and david wasn't doubting and there come a time where the armies of the philistines were gathered against israel and they were going to wage war and saul you know who was head and shoulders above i mean a full head and shoulders above the rest of the israelites he was their champion he was their mighty warrior mighty man but there was another champion greater than him do you realize there's always somebody bigger somebody's always got a bigger gun a better weapon a better defense you know it it's always when you think you've made to the top then you see there's another top but god's not looking for that that's what the devil's looking for he brings this champion who's goliath and you know saul's a giant but he's a giant among giants and and david's father sends him up to check on the battle and check on his brothers and he does and he hears i want to look at this scripture let's look at this scripture together let's look at first samuel 17. let's just go through this one together first samuel 17 10. in first samuel 17 10 it says and the philistines said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that may that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid they had a promise they had a promise that goes all the way back to abraham said thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy they had the word of god on it they had a promise but the giant to them was bigger than the promise see that's always the problem when the cancer when the debt when the financial trouble when when these circumstances whenever they start to look bigger than the word of god we are in big trouble big trouble we're set up defeat we'll be hiding in the tents but little david who had no armor who had no skill who had no weaponry he just had an anointing and under a prophet who had called him out and anointed him under a calling and under an anointing he had faith in his circumcision which was the seal of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost and he knew that baptism of the holy ghost that seal put him in the covenant with abraham and he's in the abrahamic covenant by the seal amen which is sealing the faith of abraham and now that sign makes him part of that covenant and they all had it saul had it the rest of the camp had it but they had lost confidence in the promise of god in the word of god and they lost confidence in the seal of god remember if we've got the baptism of the holy ghost we've got the very life of jesus christ on the inside how could we lose confidence in that how can we be overcome how can we be overtaken how can we be destroyed with the very literal life of jesus christ on the inside they had the seal but they had lost confidence in the seal they begin to doubt to seal because in their eyes goliath was more powerful than the covenant but i'm telling you there's nothing more powerful than the covenant and this covenant is a new covenant sealed by the blood of the creator himself his created blood when he made his own body spilt that blood amen and that became the seal of the covenant and we're sealed under by the baptism of the holy ghost to that covenant and the purchase price has been paid and everything that adam lost has been restored and it's inside of us now if we start to look at the goliaths out there and they start to look bigger than that promise we're in big trouble it's time to repent it's time to find a place to crawl down on our hands and knees and say god forgive me i've been i've been giving more favor to goliath than i have to your promised word i'm part of the covenant of christ i'm part of the seed of christ i'm by faith the royal seed of abraham and the promises that was natural to abraham is spiritual to me now and i shall possess the gates of my enemy this is not time to let news get bigger than god and news hey you guess what it's just a few little ink marks on a piece of paper but if you take faith in those ink marks on a piece of paper it'll live and it'll destroy any goliath that stands before you remember it wasn't david who destroyed goliath it was the promise that was in his life amen it was a covenant that was given to abraham god had to take that little rock and smash it between the eyes of that devil because he was standing on the word of god he said how can this uncircumcised philistine defy the armies of the living god to him size didn't matter capacity didn't matter armament didn't matter the only thing that mattered is he's uncircumcised we're circumcised he's not in the covenant we're in the covenant he has no promise i have a promise you realize he didn't look at his ability he didn't look at his strength he didn't look at his armor he didn't calculate any measure it's not our job to calculate how but to take what he's given us and brother ma'am said what did he have a little slingshot of faith it had worked before and it worked with the lion and then it worked with the bear and this little face he said not some great big faith just that little common faith you already got the one that's already in your hand shamgar didn't need a new weapon he needed the one that he'd been using all along amen it worked as a cattle prod it worked all and all of a sudden he had to realize whatever i've got in my head is enough whatever god has given us is enough that faith that got us through sickness in the family that faith that's got us this far amen that's the faith that will carry us all the way through if we don't lose confidence in what's in our hands and don't lose confidence in the word of god amen you realize when little david i mean little david shows up big men big armies big armor big everything and they're all greatly afraid when david starts to speak it creates such a different atmosphere that everybody starts to notice and some people get angry they get angry because it's exposing their unbelief iliad his oldest brother should have believed he should have ran out there and tackled that giant because he had the same promise david had got angry with him but some took notice and his faith and the atmosphere he created went all the way to the top all the way to the king and you know how much faith he had he had so much faith that the king was willing to let him go fight the giant you realize this is a ridiculous scenario the whole picture is absolutely absurd but he has such confidence in such faith and they couldn't talk him out of it and they couldn't persuade him i mean saul was using the best reasoning and logic of the day so i was saying you're but a youth he's the warrior from his youth he's got all this you've got nothing he's been trained you've got no training what's he he's hitting him with reasoning and david's coming back with faith a faith that worked in the wilderness a faith that worked with the bear a faith that worked with the lion and the same god who delivered them into my hands will deliver this uncircumcised philistine into my hands praise god don't lose confidence in this hour don't get scared don't let the news sway you one bit we've already heard the good news what's what the gospel is the good news you've heard the gospel you've heard the true report you've heard the good news don't believe the rest of it it's lying vanities god will deliver us from every child brother ben said don't fear fear is of the devil that should make it easier to rebuke it everything jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not is that right always fear not now god don't want you to fear he wants you to believe he goes on another message after through the service of this week i try to show people that there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear did you hear that friends worse than cancer is fear of cancer because we've got a god who's already healed of cancer he's healed people in this assembly that's been prayed for right here healed them of cancer cancer is nothing to be afraid of the worst thing he can put on you is not cancer it's not diabetes it's not heart disease it's not blindness the worst thing he put on you is fear because with fear you can never overcome but with faith you can overcome every one of those things the worst thing he could put on us is fear the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear if you have had cancer and didn't fear you'd believe god would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad of shape god take care of that if you were sick whatever if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that satan can place upon the person another message that there's only two faculties that govern a human one of them is faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fears of the devil you know what you'll find out when anxiety and fear comes and if you're predisposed to that because some human beings are because of the genetic makeup if you're predisposed to that you really what happens is you feel like you're nervous or anxious or fearful all the time and you feel like you have no faith but that's a lie of the devil you have faith you've got plenty of faith you've got good faith the problem is the fear is overshadowing the faith if we would resist and reject properly by the word the spirit of fear when that fear left you'd realize you've got plenty of faith you don't need more faith amen we need the faith we already have to come out from under the shadow of fear out from under the bondage of fear we need to cast away fear so that faith can take its place [Music] brother baby goes on to say the greatest thing that i find against the church tonight is fear everybody's scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy carefree just like these fellows singing up here and the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of god that's in christ god has promised you realize there's nothing to be afraid of nothing let's turn to matthew 6. we'll close with this scripture the musicians would like to make their way up brother tommy and do so at this time let's read matthew 6 together matthew 6 and 25. wherefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink oh what a challenge friends but guess what very likely in the near future we're going to see this come to pass how when where i don't know i can't predict but it's likely that you and i will see the time where we live this scripture therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat in the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit into your stature and why take ye thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what with all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles see for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's all stand i say god let me live that kind of faith i want this is the hour i've been called to do you believe that you've been called to be on earth at this time to display god and manifest his word and god loves to prove his word he enjoys it like when we get down into the squeeze and it tightens up and and god's getting excited because he's just getting ready to do something you know they got down to the red sea and the pillar fire led them down there and they all got gathered around and and and god he loves to prove his word and and he loves to prove himself mighty on our behalf and he gets them down there and they start getting nervous and he gets more excited and they get a little more nervous and he gets more excited he's got to prove himself don't wring your hands at this condition god's getting excited he wants to prove himself he wants to prove himself mighty on our behalf he wants to prove the word to the world amen he wants to prove who where the word is and where it's not remember when david started talking it was different than the language everybody else in the camp was using and when he started using that kind of language it took notice amen and when he went out there and did what he said he could do it gave them all strength to go out and kill the philistines don't be scared this is exciting times don't be afraid we have lived our whole lives for the hour that we're moving into every message book we've read every prayer we've prayed every time we've been to church has been preparation for the hours that we're moving into we've been a trained army drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled but this army is going to destroy satan's eden there's going to be a showdown there's going to be a final battle on this earth between the gentile bride and the kingdom of darkness and god is going to brew satan under your feet shortly don't give up now it's just getting good don't lose heart now it's just getting good do you realize prophets and sages and men of old and patriarchs they would have sold everything they had to stand in your place now and fight this battle they fought with devil fought with the devil fought with the devil but you're going to fight with him the last time what a privilege what a what a privilege we are what a privileged people what a responsibility we have but what a gloriful place that god has placed to set what trust and confidence he has in his seed what trust and confidence he has is in a word i said let's not let him down now let's believe oh we love god how many of you love the lord with all your heart do you feel that anticipation rising trouble can hit the mind but something inside says be quiet everything's okay go away anxiety i'm not receiving you everything's fine praise god if you just close your eyes for a minute i want to ask if there's anybody here who struggled with anxiety and fear and you want to start fighting that thing today and overcome it i'm going to ask you to raise your hands to the lord just let him know say this is the day i know what to do i've got marching orders i know how to fight and from this day god strengthened me to fight let's pray together lord jesus we thank you father god for your word your word is always yay and amen it's always positive it's always true god you're so powerful and you are your word and god you saw the hands that were raised lord there's needs in this body satan is trying to use weakness in the flesh and weakness in the mind through hybridization he's trying to take advantage of your children to bring anxiety and fear and i pray god that you would break that yoke in the name of jesus christ god you have spoken your word to the hearts of these children how to take your word with a strong hand of faith and pushed that sword to the heart of the enemy now i pray god that they would take what they've been equipped to do lord and what they've been instructed to do and i pray by your strength they do it lord by your anointing would you anoint them to the work now would you pour out your spirit upon them with a fresh anointing lord that they might take to the battle and have victory god you're not going to do everything for us there's some things that you've given us your word and your sword and your armor and you want us to do god give them the strength to fight the good fight of faith and i pray that you'd give each one victory lord so that they can come back with a testimony and say by the grace of god by the power of the spoken word i have had victory over anxiety i've had victory over fear satan we serve you notice there's a mighty army in this place we serve you notice we've got the sword of the spirit which is the word of the lord and we will drive it to your heart you will not escape you will not pass you will not pass by anymore and have your way over god's children but god's children are rising up with the word of god and the authority and power to use it and you will be defeated in the name of jesus christ leave god's children alone yoke be broken in the name of jesus christ god let faith rise up where fear tried to dominate god let peace take place they take the place where anxiety was trying to make a home god set your people free let us be a lord a well trained mighty army well conditioned and ready lord for anything you have for us we give you first place in preeminence we love you lord we sing your praises because you're worthy of praise what you have done is amazing what you will do is breathtaking and we're excited lord to be here this day and we're thankful you've allowed us to participate in this part of the drama we give you glory and honor and praise in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you to sing that song the winds
