TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh, I love him better every day. I love him better every day. Close by his side. I will abide. Oh, I love him better every day. And I love him better every day. Oh, I love him better every day and close by his side. I will abide. I love him better every day. And soon this life will all be over. And our pilgrimage will end. And we'll take our heavenly journey and be at home with Christ our friend. And heaven's gates are standing open, waiting for our entrance there. They were going over. All the beauty there to share. Oh, just a little while to stay. Oh, just a little while to wait. And just a little while to lay in that path that's always straight. And just a little more of trouble in this low and simple state. And then we'll enter heaven's portal, sweeping through the pearly gate. Soon we'll meet all the redeemed ones, and we'll take them by the hand. And soon we rise into our bosom over in the promised land. Then we'll be at home forever throughout all eternity. Oh, what a blessed blessing. That eternal morning will be. Oh, just a little while to stay here. Just a little while to wait. Just a little while to in that path that's always straight. Just a little more of trouble in this low and simple state and we'll enter heaven's portal. Oh, sweeping through those early gates. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. And through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good all the time. If you're walking through a valley and there are shadows all around, do not fear. He will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound. He has promised never leave you or forsake you. And his word is true. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest night in light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good. Oh, all the time we are sinners, so unworthy. And yet for us he chose to die. Fill us with his holy spirit. Now we can stand and testify. Oh that his love it's everlasting and his mercy they will never end. And God is good all the time. Put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good all the time. God. Though I may not understand all the plans you have for me. My life is in your hands. And through the eyes of faith, I can clearly see God is good all the time. Put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good. God is good. God is good. Oh, God is good. Once more, God is good. Oh, God is good all the time. Amen. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Oh, keep me true, Lord Jesus.

Keep me true. For there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. and seek ye first the kingom of God, and his rightuousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. Oh hallelu hallelu. And man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. Oh hallelujah hallelu. So ask and it shall be given unto you. Seek and ye shall find.

Oh, in my heart, Lord be glorified. Be glorified in my heart. Oh Lord, be glorified today. Amen. And God bless you. Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, once again, we're so grateful to be here, Lord. God, we know you've drawn us together again for we can do nothing without you, Lord. We just want to say, Lord, as we're gathered together, it's a privilege to be able to lift our voices and sing your praises. Now, to turn our hearts to your word, Lord, to read the word is a privilege. God, we pray that you'd come by your spirit, the anointing of your spirit. Would you open our understanding to understand your word? Would you feed us yourself by your own hand upon this precious word? And God, may you receive our worship and our praises, Lord. And may you take preeminence among us now. May your word find a place, a permanent dwelling place in each of us. And may be a more than just a storehouse for your word, but a place where that word will grow and manifest and be a light in this world. Help us each one come to that, Lord, more and more as the day approaches. We love you. We ask your blessing over all is said and done. Use me for your glory as I surrender to your hand. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. While we're standing, if you want to take your Bibles and turn with me to John chapter 6, we'll begin there. Amen. God bless you, Brother Howard. It's good to have you here. Amen. Anybody else who's visiting, we just want to say God bless you. And you're very welcome. Amen. Amen. John chapter 6 and verse 52. John chapter 6 verse 52. And we're yeah we're going to read uh from verse 52. The Jews therefore strove among themselves saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. Now, let's skip down to uh verse 60. Many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said, "This is a hard saying. Who can hear it?" Then Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it. He said unto them, "Does this offend you? what and if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before. Let's go now to verse 66. From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twel, "Will you also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. May the Lord bless us as we look at his word and may he grant us revelation of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could go ahead and bring the PowerPoint up this evening, I'm going to minister on our discernment. Our discernment. And uh when I was preparing for this, I prepared for it and I got done and I thought, my I think I've preached some of this before and I got nervous. I'm like, I can't if I did this like last week, I'm going to be so nervous. But I preached on discernment. I preached two parts almost 5 years ago. And so I don't think I remember everything that was said. So we're going to touch on it again, but this might be a little bit different than that. But I want to preach on our discernment. And I'm taking that from a quote, and we're going to get to that quote in just a minute. But here we find in John chapter 6 as Jesus was beginning to lay out the word but he was doing it in such a unique way. He was laying out the word in typology. He was giving out the truth. Amen. That would require a revelation to understand. It would require something more than intellectualism because he was saying something that didn't intellectually make any sense. I mean it made sense. Like we understand eat and we understand blood and we understand drink. I mean we understand body. We understand all those words. Intellectually, the words made sense. But spiritually they could not compute. They did not understand what he was trying to say. It sounded completely wrong to everything that they knew. &gt;&gt; And he was speaking absolute truth in a way that sounded completely wrong. &gt;&gt; Cuz Moses had told them, Amen, what they were allowed to eat and what they were not allowed to eat. And guess what? Human flesh never showed up anywhere on the list of pros or the list of cons. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the law of Moses forbid the drinking of blood of anything. Amen. But the pouring of it out because the life was in the blood. So everything that he was saying sounded absolutely so completely wrong. Amen. And he was so completely right. But he wasn't speaking to them on an intellectual basis. He was speaking to the soul. Amen. So those who could catch it on a faith basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then, you know, when he found out that that was hard and they were murmuring and troubled at that, he said, "Well, well, if that's hard, &gt;&gt; does that offend you? &gt;&gt; Why are you offended at that?" Listen, he just told him to eat his flesh and drink his blood. And when they stumbled at the saying and were, he says, "Why are you offended? &gt;&gt; What What did I say that was wrong?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Does that offend you?" Well, what if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before? Now he's saying, "What if you see me go back to heaven where I came from and all of a sudden everything the short circuiting in the brain?" Cuz the brain can't compute this kind of language. It takes something else, something deeper. So then, you know, they begin to walk away and he turns to the disciples and he says, "Now what about you? Are you going to go?" Amen. And Peter didn't have any more intellectual understanding or idea of what brother Brennham meant than those who were murmuring and complaining and walking away. But what Peter had was something else lodged down in his soul. And it was a receptor for the word of God. And even though his brain could not pick it up, could not compute, could not spit out the formula or the equation or the conclusion, SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE SAYS, "BUT WHERE ELSE ARE WE GOING TO GO? For you alone have the WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. I KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU SAY IS RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT IT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that you are the Christ, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm so thankful for something deeper than the brain. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, when I looked up the word discernment in the Oxford dictionary, and I have no idea if Oxford's good or not. I'm just going to tell you what the dictionary said. Discernment means the ability to judge well. The ability to judge well. And the word discern means to perceive or recognize as in something. To perceive or recognize uh that that something's true or to perceive or recognize what it is. And so discern is the basis for discernment. So it takes a perception or a recognition of something in order to properly judge it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So discernment is the ability to judge well. But in order to have discernment, you have to be able to discern. You have to be able to perceive something or or recognize something and able to properly judge it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page? &gt;&gt; All right. I hope now this is the quote that began my my my musing and my meditation. Brother says, "Now our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear, but it is determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear." &gt;&gt; That's Oh, that's good. You know what I'm getting ready to do? I'm getting ready to underline it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's determined on what discernment we have. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, how many people have heard the message, heard the prophet's ministry, heard the truth coming forth. Amen. But for some, it was an odd saying. It was hard to hard to receive. It didn't make any sense what he said. But for somebody else, they said, "It's the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would to come, if you would to come to Peter, Amen. And Peter makes this declaration. Amen. Where else shall we go? For thou alone have the words of eternal life. We know that whatever you say is basically he's saying you've got the truth. What you said is right. This is correct. Amen. Can you imagine those who walked away going to Peter later and said, "Peter, I heard what you said." Amen. Could you explain it to me maybe in a better way so that I'll understand? And Peter says, "I don't even understand. I can't explain it to you." Amen. I just take what he said and what he said is the truth. &gt;&gt; BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH? &gt;&gt; YEAH. HOW CAN YOU PROVE IT'S THE TRUTH? HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE UP AN EQUATION OR A COMPILATION AND SPIT OUT THE CORRECT? HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE IT'S THE TRUTH? And Peter would sit THERE AND SAY, "I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH." &gt;&gt; WHY? Because he HEARD AND SAW the same thing they heard and saw, but their discernment of what they heard and saw was different than Peter's discernment of what he heard and saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I want to have true discernment. &gt;&gt; And this he says, "Let me straighten a little scripture here for you." I think we're off the phone, but we're still here. St. John 5:24 said, "He that hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life." Now look, I go down the street and just take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding. Not making it say nothing else, but just saying what it says. the right word there in the Greek. In the original, it says, "He that understandeth my word." Now, to prove that's right, I go down there and here's a drunk coming along the street and with some other man's wife on his arm and cussing and taking God's name in vain and everything else like that. Say, "Did you hear what that preacher said? Did you?" Yeah, I heard it. That don't mean he's got eternal life. See, he that understandeth my word, he that is an eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Oh, so in order to understand the word, you got to be an eagle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam, I want more scripture than that. All right. My sheep, who's my sheep? &gt;&gt; The eagles. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. A stranger they won't follow. &gt;&gt; Listen, it doesn't mean Amen. It doesn't mean you have to understand everything they're saying, but you understand that that's the right voice &gt;&gt; and what he says is true and that it's correct. I may not I may not be able to figure it all out. I may stand just as puzzled as Peter was that day, but one thing I know for sure that this is this is the return of the perfect word with divine vindication. And it was sanctioned by God and vindicated by God and proved to be right by God. And it's true and it's right and it's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the voice of God. So my sheep hear my voice. What is his voice? &gt;&gt; It is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a stranger that won't follow. What's a stranger? Anything that's not the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A amen. &gt;&gt; I love the word. &gt;&gt; I love this message. I love the word. I love the truth. And and I thank God for his divine grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That uh Peter, ignorant and unlearned, &gt;&gt; knew it was true. &gt;&gt; He had discernment. Discernment doesn't come intellectually. Discernment comes by the word. Discernment comes, amen, by the spirit of God. Discernment comes to those who can receive it. And I'm so thankful for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; In John chapter 10, he says, "My father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. I and my father are one." Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, "Many good works have I showed you from my father. For which of these works do you stone me?" The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that thou being a man makest thyself God." They heard him, &gt;&gt; but their discernment told them he was blaspheing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't blasphemy. It was the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he said was exactly correct. But their discernment of what he said was that this man is blaspheing because there's no way him being a man, amen, could be equal to God. Amen. And it could be God. And he was exactly saying the truth of the word. And they were calling the truth of the word blasphemy because they had no discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. Now we go to the woman at the well. He comes to the Samaritan woman at the well. Amen. One who's lived a bad life. And the woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah's cometh. This is the end of their conversation. Which is called Christ. When he has come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. And upon this uh and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, "What seekest thou? Or why talkst with her?" The woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city and saith to the men, "Come see a man which told me all things that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Her discernment of what she heard was much different than the discernment of the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; Amen. She she saw a man who began to to begin to say strange things to her that she didn't understand about water and water of eternal life and drinking water and her becoming a well and all of these things she didn't understand. But then the man began to discern her life. Amen. When he discerned her life, she perceived him to be a prophet. THAT MEANS SHE discerned &gt;&gt; that this was a prophet. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SHE COME IN CONTACT WITH A PROPHET, SHE SAID, "OH, I'VE HAD A QUESTION FOR SO LONG. I WANT TO WORSHIP GOD, BUT THE FATHER SAY HERE AND THE JEWS say there. And he gives her an answer. And when HE GIVES THE ANSWER, SHE SAYS, YOU KNOW, MESSIAH is going to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CALLED CHRIST. WHEN HE COMES, he's going TO TELL US ALL THINGS. And Jesus says, I that speak to you am he. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nothing in her SAYS BLASPHEMY. &gt;&gt; NOTHING IN HER SAYS YOU'RE WRONG. AND LISTEN, HOW CAN SHE PROVE IT? WHAT WHAT COMPULATION DID SHE COME UP WITH? WHAT WAS THE FORMULA? HOW COULD SHE SPIT OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER? WHAT WAS THE EVIDENCE SHE HAD? SHE WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THAT THIS WAS A PROPHET. HER DISCERN HER DISCERNING HIM A PROPHET. AMEN. BROUGHT OUT ME M MESSIANIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SHE HAD DISCERNMENT. NOW SHE COULD ACCURATELY JUDGE THAT WHAT HE TOLD ME IS ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH AND HE IS THE CHRIST. SO MUCH SO SHE DROPPED HER WATER POT, RAN INTO THE CITY, and began to declare, "COME SEE A MAN." AMEN. SHE HAD HAD THE TRUTH FOR WHAT, 30 SECONDS? 5 MINUTES. AMEN. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TEST IT, TO PROVE IT. AMEN. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GO CHECK IT WITH ANYTHING ELSE. SHE HAD SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER THAT COULD DISCERN that this man was a special MAN. AND HER DISCERNMENT COULD JUDGE THAT WHAT HE SAID TO ME IS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. AND SHE COULD RUN OFF INTO THE CITY AND DECLARE EXACTLY THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE TOLD HER. The Pharisees COULDN'T DO THIS. HE SAID, "THE FATHER AND I ARE ONE." AND THEY PICKED UP A ROCK AND WANTED TO CHUCK IT AT HIM AND KILL HIM BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU BEING a man could be equal with God. &gt;&gt; So your eternal destination doesn't altogether rest on what you see and hear, &gt;&gt; but on what you your discernment &gt;&gt; of what you see and what you hear. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful to God that he's given us something to discern with. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 16, he says, "This is very, very familiar to us, but I'm going to go through it again. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesariah Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, others Jeremiah, and one of the or one of the prophets." He saith unto them, "But whom say that ye that I am?" &gt;&gt; That's the question. I always say that every time. That's the question. That's still the question. &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I'll build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. He had discernment. He had a revelation that came from the father. And that revelation, amen, wasn't just an intellectual revelation, but it was a divine revelation from the father of who Jesus Christ was, the word for that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus declares that upon this rock, what rock? The rock of revelation. Revelation of what? Revelation of present tense truth, of present tense light, of present tense Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And upon this rock, I'll build my church. And if the church is built on that rock, the revelation of who Jesus Christ is, present tense, &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Then the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're built on anything other than this revelation, Amen. the church will be on sinking sands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here's what the prophet says about this. The only way you'd ever do it would be for it to personally to be revealed to you. And do you know that's the only way that God built his church? Look, in the Garden of Eden, how did Abel know that it was a blood instead of an apple? &gt;&gt; Oh, see, it was spiritually revealed. And look, when Jesus was here on earth, he said that great notable time that he was speaking, "Who does men say that I, the son of man, am some of them said,"Well, you're Moses or you're Jeremiah or one of the prophets?" He said, "But I'm coming straight to the point. What do you think about it?" &gt;&gt; See, not what somebody else is saying now, but I want to know what you think about it. And that's when Peter spoke up and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. There's a, you know, for us, for us who associate with the message and the circles that we circle with, listen, it's not hard to make a bold declaration that I believe, amen, that that we've had a prophet in our age. And I believe that that prophet restored the word. And that word is my bridegroom. The revealed word of the hour is Jesus Christ revealing himself to me and uniting with me. and as my bridegroom and now I've received the fullness of the word which is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Returning to this bride and to be manifest in bride form. AMEN. YOU LISTEN, THAT'S THAT'S AMONGST US. THAT'S NO BOLD DECLARATION. AMEN. We can get that. Amen. We've been taught that all of our lives. Not me, but if you've been raised in the message, YOU'RE TAUGHT IT. AMEN. THAT COULD BE THAT COULD be an intellectual exercise, but it's got to be more than an intellectual exercise. Amen. HE'S NOT ASKING, "WHO DOES THE CHURCH SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID YOUR PASTOR SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID YOUR PARENTS SAY THAT I AM? WHO DID THIS BROTHER THAT YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR OR this sister YOU LOOK UP TO? THE QUESTION ISN'T WHO DOES ANYBODY ELSE SAY THAT HE IS. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR DISCERNMENT OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS YOUR DISCERNMENT OF THIS MESSAGE? AMEN. THE DISCERNMENT, AMEN, IS THE THING THAT BRINGS TO US ETERNAL LIFE. AMEN. NOT WHAT WE'VE HEARD OR SEEN OR BEEN TOLD IS TRUE OR NOT TRUE. AMEN. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT IS EVERYBODY ELSE SAYING. THE QUESTION IS, WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS? &gt;&gt; And if you IF YOU SAY, "WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS?" AND YOUR ANSWER IS A PROPHET IN MALACHI 4, YOU HAVEN'T WENT FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE THAT WAS THE INTRODUCTION TO WHO THIS IS. THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN JESUS CHRIST, THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD, COMING BACK INTO MANIFESTATION, ARE THEY TO BE PRESENTED TO A BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST PRESENTING HIMSELF TO ME TO MARRY ME, TO UNITE WITH ME, TO COME INTO ME, AND TO live through me. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY DISCERNMENT OF this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YOU CAN'T TAKE MY DISCERNMENT AND MAKE IT YOUR DISCERNMENT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SAY, "WELL, THAT BROTHER, I I see his life and I see he uses scripture and he seems to know what he's talking about. I I think he's right." &gt;&gt; It won't work, friends. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal individual revelation to you and that you know it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not because you've got the manual. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to explain it all. &gt;&gt; But something in you says, &gt;&gt; "There's no place else to go." &gt;&gt; There's nothing ELSE THAT HAS LIGHT. THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE THAT HAS TRUTH. THIS IS IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Just as much as Peter. Amen. Peter was speaking the truth without mental understanding, but he knew it was right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the question is what is our discernment? Your discernment &gt;&gt; of this message. It's an important question because eternal life is resting upon that discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it's not going to the right church. &gt;&gt; It's not sitting under the right ministry. &gt;&gt; I said many times all of us want to go to the right church. I mean, I don't necessarily want to go to a church that's off the word, and I don't want to sit under a ministry that doesn't believe the word, but listen, that's not enough, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be an individual, personal revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, now faith is a revelation from God. Faith is a revelation. There's where I want to stay there just a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by his grace. It's nothing you did. I want you to catch this. He has revealed it to you by your grace. It's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up to faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a straining and a groaning and a trying to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of straining and groaning and trying in this life. &gt;&gt; And there's not a lot of wrestling with ourselves to manifest the word and bring this body into subjection. There's a lot of wrestling. There's a lot of straining. There's a lot of groaning and walking a Christian life, but there is no straining and growing and pressing and trying in believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is not faith. Amen. If we've worked our way into believing and through much study and much straining and putting the word puzzle together and trying and trying again, I FINALLY GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN THE MESSAGE. THAT WASN'T FAITH. AND THAT WASN'T A revelation from the father. That was an intellectual exercise that put it together in a way till YOU COULD FINALLY ACCEPT IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT REAL FAITH ACCEPTS IT EVEN WHEN the pieces don't seem to match. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem to line up. I can't make sense of it. I can't explain it. I don't know how to put it all together. But one thing I know is this is the words of eternal life. And there's no place else to go for this is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if he's revealed it to you by his grace, it's nothing you did. And listen, you can't earn this revelation by being a good boy or a good girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Rem said, "Above everything else, pray for revelation." But don't pray for revelation in a way of saying, "God, I've been a good boy. I've been following the message for so long. Would you give me revelation?" JUST SAY, "GOD, BY YOUR GRACE, GIVE me revelation." It's not something we're going to strain to receive. It's something that he's going to give by grace. &gt;&gt; It's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up to faith. You ever have faith, it's given to you by the grace of God. and God reveals it to you. Therefore, faith is a revelation and the whole church of God is built upon the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say, "But just as sure as there is false, there is a true. There has to be a good dollar before a bogus dollar can be made off of it." Isn't that right? If it wasn't, why the bogus would be the real? So now it's up to your discernment. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a bogus and there's a real, you can't have a bogus unless you have a real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if there's false prophets in the world, there must be a true prophet somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's false religion, there must be a true religion. False Christianity has to be true. You understand what I'm saying? You can't have a bogus unless there's a real somewhere. You can't have a false unless there's a real. And now there's a true genuine and there's an impostor or a false out there. Brother Bam said, "NOW IT'S UP TO your discernment." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like, "Please don't do this to me. Just tell me what's right and what's wrong." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't come that way. Now, it's up to your discernment. &gt;&gt; Now, it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. To whatever is inside of you, whatever God has given you, amen, to discern whether this is true or not true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God. I didn't I jumped forward and I jumped back for a reason. I'm supposed to mention something and I don't want to forget. We all know the story of brother Brandham when God had come to him and told him to speak the squirrels into existence and happened on two different occasions. And we know that story, but I want to pick up when he was in brother Wright's house telling the story. And we all know very well that Hattie Wright said the right thing. But I want I I I took another look at it and I want to look at it together today tonight in the message. Go tell. This is one of the many places he tells the story. He said, "The only thing I know that Jehovah is still Jehovah Gyra. He's able to provide a sacrifice." And there's many other places that he says this. And he says it many times. He says, "All I know is still Jehovah Gyra." And in one place he says, "The same one that provided a ram for Abraham." &gt;&gt; And then he says, "See, I had need of squirrels." So he he goes back to this Jehovah Gyra and God being the provider and God being the one who created a ram where there was no ram. It was an instant creation, a full creation by the power of God. &gt;&gt; We're all on the same page as Jehovah. And brother Brandham said, "The only thing I know that Jehovah that Jehovah is still Jehovah Gyra, he's able to provide." &gt;&gt; And then Had and Brother Brandham says, "And not not knowing what she was saying." Had he not knowing what she was saying, raised up and said, "That's nothing but the truth, brother Brandham." Oh my, that was the right thing to say. That was the right thing to say. Oh man, if you can hone in on anything, hone on this. That was the right thing to say. I want to start saying the right thing about the word &gt;&gt; because she said the right thing. There was a tremendous reward that came her way. And about that time, the power of God struck that place. And I never felt such an anointing. When it did, I said, "Hattie, thus sayeth the Lord, ask what you will. I don't care what it is. God has given me the authority to give you your heart's desire right now. If you ask for a million dollars, you can have it. Ask for that little crippled girl to walk, get up and walk, she can have it. ask for anything. And we know she asked for the salvation of her two boys and he said, "I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen. And they fell over her knees weeping and repenting. Amen. So So we know she got amen the desire of her heart. But but when brother Benham says this, he says, "I never felt such an anointing." &gt;&gt; Have brother Brenham felt anointings before? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is, you know, he's telling this in 1960. He's felt anointings. He's been anointed for many things. He's been in visions. He's had miracles take place before his eyes. Supernatural, off the charts. He's met an angel. Amen. He's seen pillars of fire. He's seen all kinds of things. But but something about what had he did. Amen. So please God that a power of God fell so strong. He said, "I NEVER FELT such an anointing." And God told the prophet, "GIVE HER WHATEVER SHE WANTS." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE. THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN ANY OTHER time in his ministry. WE HAVEN'T SEEN anything like this ON THIS MAGNITUDE. WHAT WAS IT THAT GOD WAS so pleased with? Because brother Benham was talking about creating squirrels in the woods. And brother Benham was out THERE ALL BY HIMSELF. THERE WAS NOBODY TO WATCH. THERE WAS NOBODY TO PROVE. THERE WAS NO CAMERAS. AMEN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE HAD A PICTURE of the squirrels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You better BELIEVE IF I SPOKE SQUIRRELS IN EXISTENCE, I'M WE'RE REACHING FOR MY PHONE. AMEN. I'M NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THIS. YEAH. YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But brother Bam had nothing. He was there by himself. He heard the VOICE OF GOD. AND BROTHER BAM IS SITTING HERE IN BROTHER WRIGHT'S HOUSE, A HUMBLE LITTLE HOUSE. AND HADRIGHT, a humble little woman. Amen. And and he's in THIS HOUSE JUST DESCRIBING WHAT GOD HAD DONE. AND LISTEN, IT WASN'T THAT SHE BELIEVED the miracle. Amen. Alone. That was SO PROFOUND TO GOD. BUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM TOOK THAT MIRACLE and said, "This is none other than Jehovah Gyra. This is the same one that pre provided the ram for Abraham. He's still the same Jehovah. HE'S THE SAME GOD. WHAT WAS BROTHER BAM DOING? HE WAS TAKING THE MIRACLE AND HE WAS ATTACHING IT TO THE WORD and the word was explaining the miracle AND SAYING THIS IS THE SAME GOD THAT created a ram for Abraham IS THE SAME GOD THAT created squirrels in the woods. And Hattie right said THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT SHE BELIEVED BROTHER BRANDHAM CREATED SQUIRRELS ALONE. THAT WAS WONDERFUL. I MEAN, I BELIEVE EVERYBODY SITTING AROUND THAT TABLE believed they were friends of brother Brennham. They had seen the miraculous. They believed that he that he had he had had that experience and he spoke the word and squirrels were created. I think it was something deeper than that. It was THE FACT THAT HATTIE, AMEN, a little humble woman with not much education, with not many resources, no theologian whatsoever, couldn't hardly explain anything. When when brother Brennham cited the scriptures and SAID, "THIS IS THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ABRAHAM. THIS IS THE SAME JEHOVAH GYRA." SHE'S CONFIRMING THE WORD, NOT THE MIRACLE, THE WORD. SHE'S SAYING THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE. THIS IS JEHOVAH GYRA. THIS IS GOD. THIS IS THE WORD. AND WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED THE WORD AND MANIFESTATION IN HER DAY AND COULD BOLDLY CLAIM IT WITHOUT EVIDENCES, GOD WAS SO HAPPY WITH THAT KIND OF REVELATION. HE SAID, "YOU GIVE HER WHATEVER she wants." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what makes God happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; There's miracles that take place all over the world. There's still people with faith. Amen. If you operate by faith, God honors faith. Wherever faith is, Brother Ram taught us this. Amen. There's there's healings all over the place. There's miracles that take place all over the place. Amen. and believing in the miracle that took place in a church somewhere or in a MINISTRY SOMEWHERE. AMEN. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S CAUSING THIS ANOINTING TO come down and God to grant this woman a gift like he gave nobody else. Amen. What was h what was it is when brother Brandham says this is amen representation of Jehovah Gyra. THE SAME ONE THAT WAS ON MOUNT MARIAH and provided a lamb for Abraham IS THE SAME GOD THAT WAS WITH ME IN THE WOODS AND PROVIDED THESE SQUIRRELS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN THAT WOMAN RECOGNIZED THAT PROPHET'S WORD WAS TRUE IN THE SCRIPTURE AND GOD AND SHE SAID THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT THRILLED THE HEART OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Guess what? YOU AND I COULD DO THE SAME THING TODAY. AMEN. WE'VE GOT THE SAME thing that rests inside of us that WAS IN H HAD RIGHT. When we see the word made MANIFEST IN OUR DAY, THERE'S SOMETHING IN US THAT SAY IT'S TRUE. IT'S NOTHING BUT TRUE. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY BUT THAT IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE BOLDLY DECLARE IT IS TRUE, I believe it blesses God. Amen. &gt;&gt; How did Hadtie know? &gt;&gt; Was it a Bible study? &gt;&gt; Was it her doctorate degree? &gt;&gt; I believe she had discernment. &gt;&gt; I believe she could perceive &gt;&gt; that this was a man of God and discern that he was telling the truth. And when he got to the scriptural part, Brother Brenam says she was a little woman just sitting off in the corner. She wasn't in the main body of the conversation. She wasn't right in the middle of things that were happening. She was just off to the side just listening from the corner. But from her little corner seat outside the main circle of conversation when he got to the the part that this is the word. Amen. She said that she just blasted out that's nothing but the truth. And God was pleased. &gt;&gt; She had discernment. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't an intellectual conception. It was discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandham says. said, "Little old Hattie right there sitting in the back of the building with her heart off the things of the world." She was believing. She said, "Brother Benham, that's nothing but the truth. She didn't just say it from here. God spoke out of her heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. That was more that wasn't a brain. That wasn't a an understanding from the mind. That wasn't a being able to say, "Well, that makes sense to me because of this and that." I could compute and calculate and say po probably the the possibilities ARE HIGH. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO with any of that. It came from DOWN IN HER SOUL AND SOMETHING ROSE UP AND SAID THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God be praised. God let us operate with discernment. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2, he says, "For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is a gift of God. Little Haddie didn't come up with this on her own. She had a gift of God to believe. It says in adoption, he says by faith are you saved. That's your faith in God. He said the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice. The blood doesn't save you. The blood keeps you clean. &gt;&gt; How do you say saved? By faith are you saved and that by God's fornowledge calling you, you are saved and the blood makes an atonement constantly keeping you clean. Now, this is a this is a statement that can be confusing. Amen. And so, I want to spend just a moment on it. Uh if we could talk about it now, to say the blood doesn't save you. Amen. We know that we're saved by the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Don't be afraid. You're not contradicting the prophet. We've been saved by the blood of God. The the blood of Jesus Christ was the purchase price for all of redemption. He bought us all back. There there would there would be no salvation in the way of redemption and restoration without the shedding of blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're saved by the blood of God. Amen. It was Jesus blood that was shed shed. Amen. That brought us into a salvation experience with God. Amen. All of that is true. But listen, Jesus, when he shed his blood, he purchased all of creation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that was ever created upon the earth, he purchased back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, every Listen, oh man, this is a hard thing to say, but I I just pray that you understand what I'm saying. Everyone that goes uh goes to heaven, let's say, &gt;&gt; was purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone that burns in the lake of fire was also purchased. &gt;&gt; By the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; So you can't just say, "I'm saved by the blood." Anybody that's ever saved was saved by the blood. &gt;&gt; The blood bought all back. But what brings me into that salvation? What brings me into that salvation experience and connects me with redemption IS FAITH. I HAVE TO HAVE FAITH THAT THAT BLOOD WAS SHED FOR ME. THAT THAT BLOOD IS FOR ME. THAT HE TOOK MY place on Calvary. And when he shed his blood, it was for my sins and for my redemption and paid the price for me. AND I HAVE BY FAITH COME INTO experience of reconciliation with God and salvation and redemption BECAUSE OF MY FAITH in the blood. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I don't believe in it, it doesn't do me the benefit that it could. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brandham said, "The blood doesn't save you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he bought everything. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes into this in in in the uh church ages book. HE SAYS BECAUSE HE BOUGHT IT, he has rights to it all. And he can pass judgment and do with what he owns, with what he wishes. That's why at the white throne judgment, he can extend mercy and allow entrance into eternal life TO THOSE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY'RE GOING IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NO IDEA. HE SAYS, "BECAUSE YOU did this to the least of you." They said, "When did we do? WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE DID. WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE WE SERVED YOU. WE HAD no idea WHAT WAS HAPPENING OR HOW WE GOT SAVED OR HOW WE COME IN." IT WASN'T THEIR FAITH IN THE BLOOD. AMEN. HIS BLOOD PURCHASED THEM. They came in by his grace and by his mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT HE BOUGHT IT ALL. SO BECAUSE HE OWNS IT, he can pass this judgment. AMEN. AND THERE'S THOSE, AMEN. THAT'LL GO INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE and eternal damnation. Amen. In absolute annihilation and destruction. AMEN. THEY WERE ALSO PURCHASED. BUT BECAUSE HE owns it, he's the one who has the right to judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for us, WE'VE ALREADY COME INTO salvation by faith. AND WE WILL BYPASS JUDGMENT. WE WILL BYPASS EVERYTHING. AMEN. Because by gra by by by grace you are saved through faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that not of yourself. That is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; So now the faith is what we're saved by. And the blood because it was shed is constantly making atonement. We're constantly being forgiven for our wrongs because the blood was shed &gt;&gt; for us. Praise God. So it's by faith. the message paradox. He said, "It isn't necessary to come up here and kneel down and pray through until you're saved." What a statement. I love this. Listen, Brother Brandham wouldn't have said this in 1953, &gt;&gt; 1954, 1955 when the campaigns were going on in the revival, &gt;&gt; but he comes in 1965 and he's constantly trying to get us to operate by faith on the word to recognize something higher. &gt;&gt; Said it isn't necessary to come up here and kneel down and pray through until you're saved. Now, I want to make a disclaimer here. There ain't a thing wrong with it either. &gt;&gt; It's good for us. Amen. It's good to put a steak down. It's good to weep at an altar. It's good to find a place to repent and give your heart to the Lord and and say, "And from this moment on, I I'm I'm surrendering myself to God. There ain't a thing in the world wrong with it, friends." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not necessary for salvation. &gt;&gt; Not necessary to come up here and kneel down and pray through until you're saved. You're saved already, but you have to accept it. Your praying doesn't do it. Your faith is what you're saved by, not by prayer. But by faith are you saved. Same thing by healing. I'm sure we all understand that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, it's not even it's not even the laying on of hands that heals you. &gt;&gt; It's your faith in the laying on of hands that heals you. It's because you believe the word. When the word says they shall lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. AMEN. IT'S NOT THE SIMPLE ACT of just touching you that does it. Amen. Because if you didn't believe it will work, it won't work. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN JUST THE ACTION. THERE'S GOT TO BE FAITH in the action. You have to believe that this is the word of God and the word of God is true and the word of God won't fail. AND WHEN IT STRIKES YOUR SOUL LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW IF THIS BROTHER lays hands on me, I'll be well. THEN YOU'LL BE WELL. IT WAS YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Brandham REFERENCES THE WOMAN, AMEN, who touched the hem of his garment. Amen. And was made whole. Amen. She had some discernment. There was SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER. SHE KNEW THAT IF I CAN BUT TOUCH the hem of HIS GARMENT, I'LL BE MADE EVERY BIT. AND SHE SHE CRAWLED THROUGH THE CROWD. AMEN. SHE WRETCHED UP. SHE TOUCHED the hem of his garment. Brother Brandham said that Jesus COULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT PHYSICALLY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT TOUCHED SOMETHING IN HIM SPIRITUALLY CUZ VIRTUE WENT OUT OF HIM and he knew somebody had touched him AND BEGAN TO ASK. AND WHEN HE went over there and he looked at the LITTLE WOMAN AND FINALLY HE FOUND her and she confessed WHAT SHE HAD DONE. HE LOOKED AT HER and says, "Be of good cheer. Thy faith has made thee whole." &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT WASN'T JESUS'S PRAYER. HE NEVER prayed for her. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't pray for her. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T LAY HANDS on her. It was her faith. &gt;&gt; Something in her TOLD HER THAT IF I OH, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If I could but touch the hem of HIS GARMENT AND GOD HONORED HER FAITH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it brought the result. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love the word. Brother Benham says when when he was talking about Peter and Peter by a divine revelation from the father was able to declare who Jesus was in Matthew 16. You see Peter used that terminology and we know and we believe and he's talking about the 12. But there was one we that didn't believe &gt;&gt; and that was Judas. &gt;&gt; And Judas acted like he believed. He looked like he believed. He went along with everybody that believed, but it was made manifest in the end. In the message identification, brother Brandham and this is from 1964. Brother Brham says he what made him turn? He actually doubted the claims of Christ being the word. &gt;&gt; What made Judas turn on Jesus? He said he actually doubted the claims of Christ being the word. &gt;&gt; He could see that man, eat with him, fish with him out there, and everything else. And him being the word, he couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe he was God. &gt;&gt; But he was. Judas's character caused him to do this. Has your character done the same? Remember Judas was very religious. So it didn't matter how religious Judas was. Amen. Judas when it came down to it, he heard the same thing Peter heard. &gt;&gt; But Peter's discernment told him that this is this is the words of eternal life. This is Messiah. This is the son of God. And Judas, listen, he may have went along with it. Maybe he even tried to believe it. May may he was he was in the mix. He was all around. When he saw the miracles, he saw that was happen. He knew this was a man of God. He knew this was a miracle worker. He he HAD HE HAD ALL OF those same things and he heard the parables and had the explanation in the closed door meeting when they sat to eat. He had everything that Peter had. But Peter's discernment said, "This is the son of the living God." Judas's that Judas's discernment said, "I, you know, he's a he's a miracle worker, definitely a prophet. He's a good man, &gt;&gt; right? But him being the word, I him being God, I I just can't go there. &gt;&gt; It was his discernment of what he heard and saw &gt;&gt; that determined his eternal destination. &gt;&gt; He got the inside scoop. &gt;&gt; He was in the private meetings. &gt;&gt; He was in the boat rides. He was at the meals. He was there when Jesus broke down the parables. &gt;&gt; He saw more and heard more. &gt;&gt; But he needed more than hearing and seeing. If hearing and seeing the truth and being in a private door meeting with Jesus and Jesus breaking down the parable to you and explaining what he didn't explain to everybody else, that wasn't enough to save Judas &gt;&gt; because of his discernment of what he heard &gt;&gt; was wrong. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. God be praised. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how much we know about the message. &gt;&gt; It's our discernment of what the message is. says, "And notice Cain, he didn't want no blood sacrifice. He came down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar, very religious, done everything that just exactly like Abel done, offered a sacrifice, fell down before God in worship, obedient in every way, but without the revelation of the word." And the word was from the beginning God's plan. But God revealed by revelation that the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right, not religion, not an altar, not belonging to church, not making sacrifice, not being sincere, but by the revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; That was God's plan from the beginning. The revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our discernment of what we see and what we hear. &gt;&gt; Man, that's why formalized religion doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Formalized religion has come up with a formula to salvation. They have an absolute formula. They preach it as a formula. They teach it as a formula. The formula is that if you believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God and he died for the sins of the world and he shed his blood 2,000 years ago and you make a mental confession of that and you confess that's true and believe you're part of that and you come up and make a a statement before the church or shake the pastor's hand. Listen, I used to never understand what Brother Brena meant by come shake the pastor's hand. &gt;&gt; But when we were on vacation one time, we were down in Georgia on vacation, the whole family, and there was a a Baptist church down the road that we had seen. It was just a couple miles down the road. And on Sunday morning, I said, "Let's go to church." So, we all got ready. We all went to church, and we sat through that Baptist church. And and and it was it was it was just a a normal run-of-the-mill regular Baptist church. The pastor was a good guy. I actually liked him. The people were friendly. Amen. And I believed I discerned that this pastor was sincere. &gt;&gt; That's why my heart went out to him. &gt;&gt; But so so I went every service that they had that week. My family didn't go to the evening or the midweek, but they went to the Sunday morning. But I couldn't stay away. I just kept going back cuz my heart was burdened for this man. AMEN. BUT WHILE I WAS THERE, I WATCHED that every service. I think I went to three or four services. I don't remember. every service at the end he would give an invitation. Does anybody want to give their heart to the Lord? Does anybody want to accept Jesus as their savior? And he said the same thing almost every time. Then he'd walk off the pullpit and go and stand in front of the church and he was waiting. And the first Sunday the morning we were there, I just watched him. I didn't know what he was doing. And and and he just waited there. And then then he went back up and they closed in a song and they went. But one of the services I was there, there was a young man there that wanted to give his heart to the Lord. Amen. and he come down and he walked down and he shook the pastor's hand &gt;&gt; and he just extended the right hand of fellowship. He accepted the invitation. He put his arm around him and said, "Now he's a Christian. He's saved." Amen. And I don't know the sincerity of that young man's heart. I don't know where he is with God. I'm not passing a judgment on his salvation or where he's at. I'm just saying I saw with my own eyes the things Brother Benham was talking about. That's formalized religion. That's formalized salvation. Amen. That's a formula and that's that that's replicated over and over all the time. Sometimes it's come to the altar. Sometimes it's sign a pledge. Sometimes it's go through catechism. THERE'S SOME WAY in which you're inaugurated and accepted into the church and come into salvation. But listen, none of that is going to hold up and work. It's got to be an individual revelation to you that you you have met Jesus Christ yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how do you meet whom you've never been introduced to? Because this message came to introduce the bridegroom to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not going to be my words of introduction and your mental acknowledgement that I'm telling you the truth IS GOING TO WORK. IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT DEEPER than that. I can bring an introduction. I can preach the word by the grace of God under the anointing of the Holy Ghost to WORK AND GO OUT. BUT IT'S GOT TO STRIKE SOMETHING MORE THAN YOUR BRAIN. IT'S GOT TO STRIKE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT SAYS, "THAT'S MY LORD. THAT'S MY MAKER. THAT'S MY KING. THAT'S MY HUSBAND. AND THAT'S ALL I WANT." &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than a formal religion. Got to be more than a Sunday routine. It's got to be There's got to be a discernment of what we hear &gt;&gt; and what we see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother says, "How far away from discernment can you wander with your intellectual theologies, with your mental conception of anything? My gracious and lost friend, can you not understand that this Bible is spiritually interpreted?" Jesus thanked the father he'd hid it from the educated and shrewd and wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would come to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. How far from discernment can you wander with your intellectual the theologies and the mental conception? That stuff just takes us further away. &gt;&gt; I say, God, give me a revelation of your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hadtie Wright didn't have intellectual theologies. &gt;&gt; She had the ability to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for all we know, Peter might have been a lot like had he right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a fisherman. &gt;&gt; He was uneducated. He couldn't sign his own name. &gt;&gt; We don't know if he was polished or he was rough. We We don't know all of these things. But he could catch what Judas wasn't catching. &gt;&gt; He could catch what the Sanhedrin wasn't catching. He could believe, Amen. what what the polished couldn't believe and what the educated couldn't believe. In 1 Corinthians 2:11 he says, "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us." See this? That we might know the things that are freely given to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; How did Peter know that Jesus alone had the words of eternal life? He knew &gt;&gt; by discernment. How did Hadtie know that what brother Brandham experienced in the woods was the same God and the same thing that happened to Abraham on Mount Mariah? She just knew. &gt;&gt; Amen. which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, conspir comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Amen. Not mentally, but spiritually discerned. And this word discern, here's the definition. It's used in the New Testament as examine, judge, ask questions, search or discern. It means to examine or to judge or to investigate. To examine, inquire into, scrutinize, sift, question, especially in a forensic sense of of a judge. To hold an investigation, to interrogate, examine the accused or the witness. Amen. What a word. These things that are freely given to us, they are spiritually discerned. The spirit can distinguish what's right and wrong. It can poke through all kinds of stuff and find out where the truth is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's he's telling us that by the spirit of God, the natural man, verse 14, the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they're foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. Amen. It's that THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AMEN, is the one who brings this this discernment to our eyes. The one who can tell us what's true and not true. who can discern, who can read between the lines, who can pierce through, amen, the camouflage of something and get down to the nitty-gritty and said, "This is right." Or, "No, there's something wrong with that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not exactly right. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of God that does that for spiritually discerned. They're examined. They're judged. Amen. Prophet of God says, "The only thing that you have to recognize that he is not a myth. He's not some historical god. He's a God present. Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today, and forever. Right now, do you believe he's here? &gt;&gt; Would you discern it? I want to turn my back to this audience. Now, I'm praying the Holy Ghost will prove what I've done. I've said tonight, the closing of this message, that the same signs that Jesus said was given to Sodom, will be given to this generation. As it was in the days of Sodom, show so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. Then you discern what spirits hear. Then you discern what spirits here, brother Bam. Now, all the way back in 59, he's turning his back to the congregation and he's saying, Jesus says, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be." Amen. In the revealing of the son of man. And now, Brother Ram's going to turn his back and show the same sign that was shown, amen, uh on the plains that day, he's going to show the same sign. And he says, "Now you discern what spirit this is." MANY WALKED AWAY AND SAID, "THAT man's fanatical." I mean, that that that's mental telepathy. That's what whatever they went away and whatever it was that they believed. Amen. But there was a few there that said that's God. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture being fulfilled. THAT'S NOT JUST a miracle. THAT'S NOT JUST A SIGN. THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I WOULDN'T FOLLOW OIL IN THE hands or blood in the hand or oil on YOUR FOREHEAD." THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT RAISED up after brother Brandham AND THEY HAD ALL kinds of signs. Amen. They the AA Allen had them and there was other men that had signs and they would they would get into the spirit or they would call a woman up one time AND SHE WOULD HAVE OIL IN her hands of and then that oil would be anointing oil that would heal people and they would pray for him. Brother Brandham said, "I wouldn't believe that sign." &gt;&gt; SO WHY WERE THEY WHY WHY IS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST SUPPOSED TO BE ACCEPTED? Brother Brandham turning his back to a crowd and discerning people and say, "You over here in the red dress, you've got cancer. You over here, you've got A BACK PROBLEM." WHY NOT BELIEVE the oil in the hand? Why not believe the blood in the hand? Why not believe the oil on the forehead? Amen. THEY'RE ALL SUPERNATURAL SIGNS AND THEY WERE VINDICATED. THEY WERE VERIFIED. THERE'S PEOPLE TESTIFIED IT WAS TRUE AND WERE HEALED by it. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY BROTHER BRAM SAID HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT? HE SAID BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE WORD. THE SCRIPTURE NEVER TELLS US TO LOOK FOR THAT. BUT JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT, IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT BE IN THE revealing of the SON OF MAN." WHAT WAS DONE TO ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED IN that day is the same sign that's coming back to Abraham and his seed this day. AND THE ELECT OF GOD SAY THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THAT WORD IS TODAY. WHAT WE SAW IS WHAT JESUS SAID. AND OUR HEARTS PUT THE TWO TOGETHER AND SAY AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HAD WRIGHT WAS ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEOLOGY, WITHOUT INTELLECTUALISM, WITHOUT A DEGREE. &gt;&gt; How are we able to do it? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT PROOF? WHAT EVIDENCE? IT'S MORE THAN JUST SEEING A MAN MAKE DISCERNMENT. AMEN. YOU CAN SEE ALL KINDS OF SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF. BUT WHAT IS IT? THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT SAYS THAT'S NOT JUST A MAN DOING A MIRACLE. THAT'S A THAT'S THE FULFILLMENT OF SCRIPTURE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD PROMISED FOR THIS HOUR. THAT IS THE WORD FOR OUR DAY BEING MADE MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, DO YOU THINK THAT PLEASES GOD? IF IT PLEASED GOD WHEN HAD HE COULD DECLARE. WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOUR HEART LEAPS UP AND SAYS, "I KNOW IT'S TRUE. I KNOW THAT'S THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. I KNOW THAT'S MY LORD JESUS CHRIST DOING." THAT'S NOT THAT, MAN. THAT'S GOD FULFILLING HIS OWN WORD AND SHOWING TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM, HE'S HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to have the privilege to say that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 4 says, "For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and the marorrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart." See, God, when he's giving discernment, it's discernment on the word, but it's discernment by the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Ram turned his back and showed the sign of Messiah, the same that was done to Abraham on the plains of memory, when he showed that, that was the word. It was the word vindicating the sign or pointing out the sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the manifestation of the word vindicated by the word. Amen. That the elect of God says that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just an arbitrary sign. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just an arbitrary wonder, &gt;&gt; but the fulfillment of scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and the joints and mars a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of what is it that's discerning us now. What is it discerning everybody? It's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was it that discerned had right? It was the word. What was Hadi Wright discerning? The word. What was discerning her? The word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fact that she could discern the word was the word discerning her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE VERY FACT THAT SOMETHING in you can discern this word is nothing but the truth. It's the very word discerning that you are part of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's only for the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this this this WORD CUTS SO SHARP. AMEN. IT DIVIDES THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL. AMEN. WHICH THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL OF MAN ARE SO close that sometimes it's so hard to discern which is which is the spirit which is the soul. Amen. Which is ME WHICH IS GOD. AMEN. BUT THE WORD CAN CLEAVE those two right down the middle and separate them because the word has the power of discerning every situation and every human being and everything is discerned by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Peter was discerning that you're the fulfillment of the word. &gt;&gt; That's what he discerned. Amen. In John 6, when everybody walked away, he says, "Listen, I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, but I know you're the word, and you alone have the words of eternal life, and everything you say is right and true." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was discerning the word, but the word was discerning him. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. When you can look at that sign of the Messiah and say, "That's Christ. That's not that man. That's Christ in that man." And that's the word that's promised for our day. That's the fulfillment of the scriptures. That's nothing but the truth. Amen. What it is is the spirit of God and you giving you discernment of the word. The word discerning the situation and the prophet and the word discerning you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; I say, "Discern me, Lord. take that word and separate spirit and soul and get down to my soul and show what's real and what's true. That's what happened to Judas. Judas looked like a believer. Judas acted like a believer. Judas cast out devils. Judas healed the sick. &gt;&gt; Judas walked with Jesus. Judas was in the storm when the waters were calm. Judas, he saw Peter walk on the water. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he saw Jesus come to them walking on water. He was there for it all. And but yet the word of God when he could not accept the fullness of the word. He could go along so far, but he just couldn't see that man being the word and he couldn't see that man being God. Amen. The word began to separate what was spirit and what was soul. In Judas's spirit, he could be a believer, but not in his soul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Could only go so deep. He could only agree so much. He could only go so far. But when it come down to it, it was the word that discerned Judas &gt;&gt; because he couldn't go all the way with the word. &gt;&gt; And so, the word is what discerned him. Amen. Brother Brennham says this, "No true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God, as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament." What is it that's going to sharpen our discernment? It's the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is it that will give us more discernment? The word. What it What is it that will perfect our discernment? our ability to rightly judge the word. &gt;&gt; I want to look at that. Amen. God has given us, Amen. By his grace, there's a certain measure of discernment that's in the heart of the believer. Amen. By grace, amen, that can discern that this is nothing but the truth. That's the grace OF GOD. BUT YET, THAT DISCERNMENT can grow into perfection and be able to rightly divide and discern all the situations in our life by what? The same word. &gt;&gt; I want to look at a few things that that the scripture says here as we close. No true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God. Listen, if God by a revelation gave you a a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and brought you into a salvation experience, I mean, that is wonderful. That was discernment of the word. That was the grace of God. That was a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't stop there. Keep feeding on the word. Keep receiving more word. Keep discerning more and keep understanding more and keep growing more. Amen. We're not just to have enough discernment to say, "This is the truth. I BELIEVE THIS IS." NO. BUT KEEP GROWING IN THE WORD AND keep feasting on the word because no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and ALIVE THAN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AND adherence to the pure word of God. Let's keep receiving revelation and growing in the in the revelation of the word because it's making us stronger and spiritually healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And alive. Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by &gt;&gt; hearing and hearing by the word of God. Do you know that faith can grow? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith can increase. Remember I mentioned a few sermons ago, I don't remember where or when, but I mentioned the scripture where Paul says,"I desire to come to you to see you, so you can see my face so that I uh so that I can give to you what you lack in faith." I don't remember the exact words, but so that I can I do have the exact words. They're at the end of my notes. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He says, yeah, this is 1 Thessalonians 3:9 and 10. He says, "For what thanks can we render to God again for you? For all the joy we're withwith, we joy for your sakes before our God night and day, praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith." Perfect means to complete or bring to full maturity. But these are already believers. They're already born again. They have the Holy Ghost, but yet their faith can come to perfection BY WHAT? BY A visit from Paul. So if I could just get a visit from Paul, my faith can come perfection. All I got to do is see his face. NO. WHAT WAS PAUL DOING WHEN HE WAS VISITING? He was preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the PREACHING OF THE WORD THAT WAS BRINGING THEIR FAITH INTO PERFECTION. AND PAUL HAD A DESIRE TO COME TO them that they might grow in faith. Amen. That their faith might increase. Amen. And if their faith increases, their discernment will increase. They'll be ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. AMEN. And point out the ws OF THE DEVIL AND STOP FALLING INTO THE TRAP BECAUSE SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT BY THE WORD will sharpen as our faith increases. &gt;&gt; So faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Now second Peter 3 says this. I'm going to finish with these two scriptures. As also in all his epistles speaking them of thing of these things in which are some things hard to be understand. And he's referring now to the apostle Paul which they that are unlearned and are unstable rest. That means they twist as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction. Means they couldn't receive what Paul was teaching and they were twisting them to their own understanding and it was bringing their destruction. They weren't rightly discerning Paul who he was and what right he had to say what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As they do the other scriptures under their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things, beware before, beware, lest you also, being led away with the air of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness. But grow in grace. But grow in grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To him be glory both now and forever. You mean you can grow in grace? Peter says so. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can grow in the grace that God's given we can grow into the full stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Because no true believer is spirit strong and spiritually healthy and alive as his knowledge of and adherence to the true word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, God, grow me in your word. &gt;&gt; Listen, this message didn't come just so we could hear enough of it to say, "Oh, yeah, that's the truth." and then lay it down and never read it again and move on and say, "Hey, God gave me discernment. Brother Beam's a prophet. Amen. This is the message." No. Let's grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. And let the word of God give us discernment of everything in our lives. May the word of God help us to discern our own heart. May the word of God help discern everything that's going on around us. Discern the situations that are in the world. HOW ARE THEY DISCERNED? BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then I want to finish with this scripture. Hebrews 5 11-14. Of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing. He was wanting to speak more of MelkiseDC. For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God. So he says, I'd like to say more about Melzdc, but you're not ready. You're too immature. But aren't you glad we've come to a day where somebody told us the rest of what Paul didn't tell us about &gt;&gt; MelzDC. &gt;&gt; It must be the season for full maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or else he wouldn't be telling us the rest of what Paul didn't tell us about &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to read verse 12 again. For when the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, or to become such as have need of milk, and not strong meat. For everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belongth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. What will the strong meat do? The strong meat will give you by reason of use of what? The meat. The word. Have your senses exercise to discern both good and evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means if I keep eating this strong meat, by my exercise in the strong meat, it's going to sharpen and hone my discernment where I can discern good and evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe God has given us discernment by his grace. I believe God has given us discernment by his word and God has given us the pure word &gt;&gt; so that we can grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. And God has given us discernment by his word and it works by his word and by his spiritual anointing anointing the word that we've received to give us eyes to see and ears to hear and a discernment of what's going on around us. &gt;&gt; Right? To discern is to perceive &gt;&gt; or to recognize. &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, I recognize this. It's in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you next time you fall into trouble and and something happens and and LIKE CHAOS BREAKS OUT in in your life and you you know you walked into another trial and everything goes topsyturvy AND GO UPSIDE DOWN ALL THE SUDDEN IF WE'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE in the word if if our if our reasoning is exercised by use of the strong meat all of a sudden IT'S SAYING SAYING GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME? WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE? ALL OF A SUDDEN, SPIRITUAL SERMON SAYS IT SAYS, "OH, THIS IS WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS." AND THINK IT NOT A STRANGE THING when you fall into diverse temptations. Hey, this is working for me. Patience and patience is BRINGING ME TO PERFECTION. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WORD SAYS will happen to a believer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you see how discernment works by the word. And all of a sudden, the word discerns the situation. And all of a sudden, I'm not feeling outcast from God's economy and thrown away. and he doesn't love me and he doesn't know me and he's mad at me and he's punishing me and all these other nonsense things. Why would God do that to a child of God? What he's doing is what he promised TO DO. HE'S PERFECTING US. AMEN. Through the fiery trials, amen, through the temptations, he's proving us and he's showing what's inside. &gt;&gt; And as we mature on the strong meat of this word, it brings discernment to every situation in our lives to where all of a sudden, AMEN, WE'RE NOT TOSSED ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE. NOT TOSSED BY EVERY TRIAL THAT comes along, but all of a sudden there's a steadiness that settles in and say, "Listen, amen. This is exactly ACCORDING TO THE WORD. I RECOGNIZE this by the word because this is what Peter said. THIS IS WHAT PAUL SAID. THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WAS GOING to happen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now my life is not in chaos. My life is perfectly in order because God said it would be &gt;&gt; because he knows the way I take. And the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord. And God knows the end from the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I can discern where I'm at by the word. &gt;&gt; Where am I? I'm in a trial. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; For perfection, &gt;&gt; for purification of gold, for the proving of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. not little children anymore, but growing in discernment by the revelation of the word, by feeding on the word, by receiving the word, by the word, anointed by the spirit of God, bringing us into discernment of everything around us. There was a time that Paul, I think it was he was talking to Timothy, I think. Anyways, he was writing in one of his epistles how he was in prison and he said he was in prison and and and and everybody had left him. He says, "But I'm paraphrasing in case you couldn't tell, but it's a good thing &gt;&gt; because my bonds have given more courage to them to preach the gospel more boldly." &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? That was a man who could discern a situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a man who didn't slip into despair because of the happenings to him. That was a man who could take the word of God and say, "The promises of God are still true. Everything he said about me is true. What he's called me to is still true. If God's allowed this to happen, then it's a good thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was growing in his spiritual discernment by the word. And friends, that's a gift of God. And God has given him us his word as a gift and he's given his spirit as a gift. Let's keep feeding on the strong meat of the word. &gt;&gt; In Paul's day, they needed milk because they weren't ready to hear about MelkiseDC. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But if we're ready to hear about MelkiseDC, this must be a meat age. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's eat the strong meat of the word. And let the word discern us. Discern situations, discern our lives, and let's not let the devil interpret to us what's going on, but let's have discernment by the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, if brother Benham said, "Your eternal destination does not entirely rest upon what you hear and see," &gt;&gt; that means you need to hear and see the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Not entirely, because you do need to hear and see it, but based off your discernment of what you hear and see." If that's true for our eternal destination, I believe it's true for every day of our lives and every situation we face. Our success and our walk in this world is not just necessarily based on what we've heard and seen or what's going on all around us, but our discernment of what's going on all around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that keeps us from going up and down and up and down and I'm a bride and no I'm not. I'm a bride and no I'm not. I'm a bride. No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; Discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that when life goes up, I know what the word says about me. When life goes down, I know what the word says about me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What brings stability? Discernment of the word. Amen. What what what brings uh peace in our hearts? Discernment of the word. What gives us the ability to discern the situations in our life? The word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing that he's brought in this age on his word in our lives. Amen. That word is starting to change our focus and change our vision. And we're behaving not not not letting the devil interpret the situations to us and not letting the world interpret the situation and not letting another human being interpret the situations to us. &gt;&gt; Some human being will come along just like Job's friends and say, "You know why this is happening to you, don't you?" &gt;&gt; It's like, "Ah, I never realized you're God's replacement." &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad to meet you now. The one who knows everything about everybody in every circumstance. Listen, they show up in every trial. &gt;&gt; But now, &gt;&gt; listen, somebody can say, "I know why this is happening to you because this, this, and this, and this is happening because of that. But I'm not looking for any of that." Now, what is the how does the word describe my situation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did God say about where I'm at? What did God say about me? What did God say about this trial? What did God say about this? What what did God say? If I can find it in the word, then I can start to discern it. And that discernment of the word anointed by the spirit of God can cut &gt;&gt; to the soul and the spirit and begin to divide the things that are so hard for me to divide, so confusing, so mysterious in my mind. But if I can take and find the word and begin to apply the word by the grace of God to the situation, the word will begin to discern the situation and expose the hiding place of the devil and put me back in my right position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe what we need is discernment &gt;&gt; of what's going on in our lives every day. &gt;&gt; How are we going to get it? By grace. &gt;&gt; By revelation, by the spirit of God, and by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what do I say to you? What do I need to do, Brother Chad? What is it? I need more discernment. I just keep reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep listening. Keep feeding. Keep taking in the word. Keep praying for revelation. Keep asking God for more of his spirit in your life. A deeper relationship and a greater revelation of this message of the scriptures and that the word will discern &gt;&gt; the situations in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what's our discernment? I want to start asking the question now when somebody calls me up or comes to me and says, "My whole world's falling apart. Everything's upside down and everything's gone wrong." You know what my next question will be? It probably won't be. I'll probably say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I love you and I'm going to hear for you and all that." But at some point, I want to slip in. What is your discernment of what's happening to you right now? &gt;&gt; Because if your discernment of what's happening to you right now is I must not please God, I must not be bride. this wouldn't be happening to me if I was a child of God. Your discernment is what's causing the problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not the problem. It's your discernment of what's happening is where the real problem lies. Because if you could discern what the word says about you and what the word promised in every trial and what the word does to expose all of these trappings of the devil, if we could have that spiritual discernment, there wouldn't be a problem because the problem would come under our feet and we would keep moving on because we know that this is the will of God concerning me. So, I give thanks for it and I move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, don't get your feelings hurt if I ask you that question. What is your discernment of what's happening to you right now? &gt;&gt; Well, my discernment is everything's wrong and God forgot about me and that's why you're having problems. But you can have the worst day of your life and if your discernment is God hasn't forgot about me. I'm still a child of God. This is to working together for good. God meant it for my good and not for harm. So, I'm just going to keep believing the word and keep pressing forward. Guess what? You're going to have victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day of your life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, the question is is what is our discernment? What is our discernment about the word? I hope God's answered that for most of us. But what's our discernment about the word every day unfolding in our lives &gt;&gt; and the situations all around us? I say, let's pray for more revelation. Let's all stand. Musicians, if you'll come please. And brother John, we're never going to be spiritually strong and healthy as our knowledge of and adherence to the true word of God. How many believe we receive the true word of God in this day? &gt;&gt; So, you've got what it takes. Who believes it's the strong meat? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then let's eat it, friends. &gt;&gt; And be exercised by to discern good and evil. The world's got to a place where it calls good evil and evil good. &gt;&gt; But the word of God cuts through all of that mess and calls evil evil and good good. &gt;&gt; And I think the word of God is going to get to the place where it stops calling our trials evil and starts calling them good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that what the word says? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the bad things that happen, but the result of what God brings in our life is good. and it's for good and it'll work together for good and it'll bring about good and he's allowed it because he's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God discern our lives. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Lord, thank you for this word. And Lord, I pray that you would just hone in our discernment according to the revelation of your word. May you reveal it to us in a deeper way, a more personal way, a way that makes the word so real every day. Not what I heard on Sunday, not what I heard preached on Wednesday, but when I wake up Monday morning and face my first trouble, may that word be a living reality at that moment. Lord, may you do it for every one of my brothers and sisters and for myself included. May you give us a greater discernment, Lord, a greater revelation of of the hour we live in, the the the forces that we're facing and the word that's being made manifest. God, I pray if there's any here that don't have a genuine revelation and discernment of what this message is, may you grant it to them now, Lord. God, for we know there's nobody can work their way into it. Neither can we preach anybody into it. Neither can we force it upon people. But oh God, by your grace, your graciousness in our lives, would you just unlock the mystery in the hearts of your children? these young people who haven't yet received their own revelation, would your grace unlock it to them now. Anybody who's been around for a while but confused on things and uncertain and frightened, I pray God that your grace would go now to them and would you unlock the the mystery in their hearts and give them discernment of what this really is all about. And may you give them a personal connection with yourself and a revelation of who you are in this hour. And this day, today, who are you today? And God, the rest of us who've received that by grace, we are so thankful, Lord. But the devil's coming at us with every tactic, with every tool, with every weapon, with everything that he can. But God, we know by your word that no weapon formed against us shall prosper. For you have given us a measure of the word that has never struck the earth before. And we ask, Father, that you would just give us a greater revelation of that word. May you unlock it to our hearts. May you feed it to us, Lord, by your divine grace. May your spirit open our understanding to catch the revelation of the word for the hour we live and our place in that word. And God would through that, would you give us discernment to discern good and evil in every situation? God, we're asking for it, Lord, as we feed on your word. May you quicken it to us and make it alive in us more and more day by day. For we trust you. We love you. We know this is the source. We know you've opened the fountain to us. You we know that you're the lamb that we're feeding on. We know that this is the very truth that's going to carry us all the way to a body change and we're feeding on it in the name of Jesus Christ. God, would you come and reveal it to us like never before? We love you. We need discernment in the hour we live in. the darkest age, the darkest hour. When Satan's coming to his full power of deception, you have shined the brightest light to give us the greatest discernment, the greatest potential to discern and withstand. And we ask that you would unlock it to us by your grace in Jesus Christ's name. We love you. We thank you for this. May you bless your people as we go from here. May we go as bright and shining lights. May we walk forward with discernment. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John, &gt;&gt; give me more revelation. Let my life be all forsen. Let the word of God guide me on my way so he can have preeminence each day. Give me more revelation and let my life be your reflection. For I know that this word is my redemption. Give me more revelation. Give me more revelation and let my flesh be all forsaken. and the word of God guide me on my way so he can have every day. Give me more. Let my life be your reflection for I know this word is my redemption. Give me more revelation.
