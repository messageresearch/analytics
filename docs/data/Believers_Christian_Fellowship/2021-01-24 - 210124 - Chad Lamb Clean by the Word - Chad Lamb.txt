be with you this morning may god bless us as we turn to his word let's take our bibles go to psalms 51 amen we have a baptism at the end of service today that we're excited about spencer george has decided to follow the word and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so we'll be doing that at the end of service today that's always a good service amen when we see somebody come to the lord and obey the word and while we're standing let's learn to psalms 51 psalm 51 verse 7. we'll just read one verse and then we'll ask the lord to bless the reading of the word psalm 51 verse 7 purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord and we thank you god for this atmosphere lord i appreciate lord a body of believers who wants to sing your praises and i appreciate your desire to have fellowship with us lord for if it wasn't you drawing us there was nothing we can do and if you didn't love us first we could never love you back look always so appreciate lord the fellowship and now we come to the the preaching of the word we ask that you would take preeminence lord we haven't come to hear from a man we've come to hear from you father we've come to you as our great shepherd and asked that you would break the bread of life lord and you would feed us fresh manna from heaven for you know what we have need of lord we pray you would give it to us now that we might be sustained in this journey of life lord we give you first place lord let me give you a word preeminence we ask that you would speak in jesus name we pray amen you can all be seated for a title today i would like to take the subject of cleaned by the word clean by the word and last service we were talking about the building on a strong foundation we're talking about the foundation of faith and how abraham believed god and it was imputed in him for righteousness and and what a strong foundation that is because we find that the seed of god has the capacity to believe the word of god for their day amen there's many people that can believe what has already happened what has been proved what has been testified of amen but the seed of god can receive the word for their day amen and be able to receive the word for their day amen god is able to impute unto them righteousness and this was god's plan of salvation from the beginning and so upon that strong foundation we we have to have that sort of foundation because we have a tendency to get knocked around in life and not everything always goes right we don't always make good decisions we make mistakes we have failures we have fallings and and we have the devil always whispering in our ear amen trying to brother ben said he can put thoughts in your mind right he can't read your mind but he can put thoughts in your mind amen and so many times the devil is is rambling through our mind with thoughts that don't match the word don't have anything to do with the word but sometimes he'll use the word in a deceptive way to try to trip us up and that's why we need the firm foundation of the faith of abraham that i'm a seed of abraham because i have the faith of abraham and god has imputed unto me righteousness not by my works or by my deeds but because he placed inside of me something that could believe him today and by that i recognize that i'm his amen and so and by that i'm saved i'm saved by faith but today i want to talk about clean by the word i want to keep keep progressing on as the lord leads and here when we look at this scripture i love the way this is worded amen because it smacks in the face of denominationalism it says purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean it says wash me and i shall be whiter than snow so in this passage of scripture it has nothing to do with the person making the request they have no ability to wash themselves or make themselves clean the request is the request is purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean if you purge me with hyssop i'll be clean wash me and i'll be water if you wash me i'll be whiter than snow it wasn't somebody saying lord i've washed myself i've prepared myself i've done everything right and now i'm clean but they've come to the realization if if you purge me with hyssop i'll be clean if you wash me i'll be white as snow and this is one thing that we must realize that that this is god's doing amen this is god's work because it's his desire it's his determination it was the heart purpose of god to have a bride of his own choosing and if he's going to have a bride of his own choosing amen there's certain criteria that his law requires amen and he cannot be joined to iniquity he cannot join himself to evil amen first it must be purged it must be sanctified it must be clean before he can unite with it and if this is god's heart purpose his great desire to have a bride of his own choosing then if we come in a sinful way in a fallen flesh by the fall and the garden of eden but god still purposed that we are his bride and his law forbids him from uniting with anything that's evil amen then he has to put in place a mechanism so that his desire can be fulfilled and by the grace of god he has placed that in his word amen let's go to revelation chapter 1 and look at this revelation chapter 1 and verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen who washed who he washed us let's go to ephesians chapter five we've got quite a few scriptures so keep your bibles handy with you we want to go through a number of scriptures this morning ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish wow if that's what god's determined to do then that's what he's going to do and and i by faith can be the recipient of his determinate counsel of his if his desire of his heart's purpose amen and so if it's not amen there's nothing we can do of ourselves there's nothing we can do for ourselves amen all we can do is accept what he's already given what he's already done we must come god's way according to god's plan but it's his plan and his purpose and his desire so he gave himself for the church that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so that he might sanctify it so that he might cleanse it by the washing of water by the word so he does the washing he does the cleansing and he provided the cleaning mechanism which was the word praise be to god that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish i'm so glad the scripture didn't say that christ is waiting amen for his wife to wash herself and become perfect and wrinkle fee without blemish and then he'll receive her because if the word was written that way i would be a very discouraged human being believing that i will never be the bride of jesus christ i will never come into the invisible union i will never take a body change but because he said he would do it i can have faith that i am the bride i will come into union i have come into you jesus christ i will go i will take a body change i will be united with him physically in the millennial reign i will because he's going to do it amen not because i do it because he does it not because i wield it but because he willed it amen so i can have faith because of the way the word is written because if it was written differently i would be very discouraged i would be very uh i would be upset i would be in depression all the time because no matter how much i try amen evil is present with me when i would do good evil is present with me no matter how much i try i can't hit that place in my own efforts with my own will to do everything just right we've been sown into a corrupt body of flesh with the human spirit and not no fault of our own is what brother branham said not no fault of our own it was because of the fall in the garden of eden but because we come corrupt because we come polluted amen we don't have the mechanism within ourselves to get to the place where we must be to be united with the holy god so god had to provide something amen to make sure that his will would not be thwarted by a fall so god has provided that for us he says in the message hear ye him this is the washing of the water of separation by the word the word that washes us and cleanses us and sanctify them father through the truth he said thy word is truth is that right and we are washed we are washed of the waters of separation from our sins by the word of god the word separates us and sets us in place so god has provided everything that we have need of and that he has provided everything to meet his own requirements god's provided he's only asking us to believe you know when the children of israel were coming out of egypt god provided everything they needed to come out of egypt and go to the promised land he sent them a prophet with the word he sent them a pillar of fire for leadership amen when they were thirsty he sent water when they were hungry he sent bread amen he provided everything he gave them protection he gave them leadership he gave him his word he gave them everything they needed to get out from under bondage in egypt all the way through the wilderness journey and all the way established into the promised land they had everything all they had to do was trust him believe him obey him and rely on what he had given and where they failed is when they failed to stay with what he gave and they failed to trust him in the way that he was working the failure in the wilderness was not god's failure it was man's failure to stick with god's program and every time we fail and i mean it's not god's failure it's never god's failure it's our failure to stay with his program because if we stay with this program and stay with his word it will never fail amen they fell in the wilderness because they didn't trust his word they failed in the wilderness because they didn't trust his prophet they failed in the wilderness because they didn't trust his provision and i say i don't want to fail i want to trust his word i want to trust this prophet i want to trust the leadership of the pillar of fire i want to trust his provisions and i want to stay right in there no matter what it looks like to my mind no matter how scary it is amen to my emotions i want to stay right there with the word because it's the word that washes us now let's go to john 15 the gospel of john chapter 15. now it's it's interesting we're talking about subjects we've talked about for years like this previous wednesday we were really talking about justification by faith and we know that that god builds us up through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost that that's the the new birth experience and and we know that you know we've had uh uh through luther we've had justification through wesley we've had sanctification baptism of holy ghost through the pentecostal age amen all bringing us to a perfect image of a perfect bride amen that was the purpose that's what brother bam said uh luther wesley and pentecost were all foreshadowing reflecting the coming of a perfect bride because all of these things come together amen in the in the person of jesus christ in his bride so when we talked about you know justification we can start talking about justification oh i know that and i know that but i tell you when we come to wednesday it was a pleasure friends because the word keeps getting richer and the things that we thought we knew we didn't know them as we ought to and still today the things that we think we know we don't know them as we ought to amen because they go deeper than we could ever imagine the most simplest of the of the simple understanding god gave us the most simple basic fundamental of doctrines they go deeper than we could ever imagine and now we're looking at sanctification but i tell you friends to me as i study this it goes deeper than i ever imagined amen the word amen takes something that that we call uh simple that the denomination would call simple or basic amen but it's not simple it's not basic amen it's god it's god moving in our lives it's deep and it's rich and it's meaningful and it's personal to us in john 15 3 it says now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you oh praise be to god you are clean through the word that i've spoken to you he's going to wash her by the washing of the water by the word amen he is going to make sure that he's going to get a word to his elect that will clean the elect amen he didn't tell them to go get clean amen he told them you're clean by the word that i've spoken unto you he's laying a principle down to the disciples amen that my word has the power to clean amen has the power to sanctify amen see this i hope i hope by the end of the morning this morning that we can take old pilgrim holiness and nazarene and methodist ideas amen and then let them be transformed to the reality of what god was trying to bring it wasn't a form or a method or or a religious set of orders that god wanted to sanctify his church by it was his word amen he wanted to sanctify his church by the washing of the water of the word and when men caught the fact that that we must be sanctified it's it's it's it's a scriptural principle that you must be clean you must be a clean vessel you must be holy and consecrated unto the lord amen then then you know men always they take the simplicity of the word and they make it complicated god said you must be clean you must separate you must unite to him you must separate from everything else and join only to him and let all your affection and all your love be on him and he would wash you but because men saw sanctification as a as a bible teaching amen then they had to make themselves sanctified then we all had to come up with all kinds of rules and orders and abstain from this and do this but don't do that and and if you do this and there's nothing wrong with recognizing in the word it's wrong to do this i mean you can't listen to a tape harley where brother bannon doesn't tell a woman how to dress and not cut her hair and a man not to tell dirty jokes and so he's telling you live right live clean do right make good choices amen there's not hardly a tape that you can listen to brother branham is not compelling people to live godly in christ jesus but the problem is when we think that by efforts of living right and and dressing right and wearing the right kind of hair and clothing and the right actions that somehow we can be sanctified by that amen we begin to get ourselves really discouraged because if if the power of sanctification is only in our ability to make good choices we're never going to arrive to the destination it'll be three steps forwards and two steps back i mean constantly all the time up and down and in and out and back and forth amen but but god wants you to make good choices because you love him he wants you to choose his word and choose him he wants you to surrender your will to his he wants you to unite only to him and forsake all others that's what he wants amen but he doesn't expect you to clean yourself he said i will clean you by the washing of the water of the world clean purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be white as snow if i do it myself it won't be a thorough cleaning so jesus says you're clean through the word which i have spoken unto you let's go to john chapter 6. in verse 63 john 6 and 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life it's the spirit and the life that will change your life amen comes from the words that he speaks the prophet of god says in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever because as we see the gentile days ending and the coming of the blessed lord jesus we would ask that our hearts would be made pure as we study the word give us the word for the washing of the water by the word for to cleanse our minds from all unbelief amen see the real problem is unbelief it's not so much actions but unbelief amen actions are an outcropping of unbelief but the problem is unbelief and brotherhood is saying lord give us the word for the washing of the water by the word for the to cleanse our minds from all unbelief amen the word is there amen to fix the real root of the problem amen so so many times we can chase down symptoms and get tired trying to rein in symptoms and to fix symptoms amen but we got to get down to the root of the problem and the root of the problem is unbelief amen unbelief in god's word amen is the real sin and the only sin there is everything else is an attribute of sin or an outcropping or a manifestation of sin so we can go and clip weeds here and clip weeds here and clip weeds here amen but we've got to dig down and get to the root and the only thing that can do that is the washing of the water by the word amen to wash out unbelief wrong ideas wrong thinking amen and give us the revelation of the true word it washes let's go to john 17. john chapter i just 17. to lay in quite a few scriptures here john 17 and 14 i have given them my word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through the truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth so sanctification comes by the word and thy word is truth sanctify them by thy truth so we need the word of god that's why there's been such a restoration of the word in our day and and i don't know that we ever can fully realize or fully comprehend the value we have in the restored word because the restored word has a power in it it is nothing less than the mystery of god revealed the revelation of jesus christ amen not the partial revelation but the whole revelation of jesus christ the seals have been opened the mystery has been taken off the book the entire bible has been open and if the truth is going to bring a sanctification what will happen when the entire bible now has been opened and all the truth that's been laying in mystery form for generations has now been opened and revealed to the bride what kind of sanctifying power comes with that truth amen you know you know uh there's there was a life that needs to be lived in this day and that life can only be lived by the sanctifying power of the word not by a a man's measuring stick or a rule book or or any sort of a man-made guidance that's not going to cut it it's got to take the power of the word to wash out all the unbelief amen to give us the ability to live the life that he's called us to live in this day the bride should live a life like none other amen we're coming to the end where it's the manifestation of jesus christ in bride form all that he was amen he poured into the church and it needs to manifest the very life of jesus christ and how are we going to do it without the washing of the water of the word for an extreme manifestation he sent an extreme word so that the power is not in us so many times we can hear preaching we have to be this and the bride has to be that and we've got to be this and it's all every bit true but it's not going to be done by our own power and efforts and will and ability it's going to be done by the word that he sent to us he sent his word and he healed her disease amen he spoke the word and he cleansed us amen so there's so many times that that we struggle with things we struggle with besetting sins we struggle with habits we struggle with personality we struggle with all of these and we are fighting so hard to try to overcome those things am i the only one we we hate those things that trip us up we hate those things and we're trying to fight those things but i'm telling you friends we're just making ourselves tired because the real overcoming power comes by the washing of the word we've got to stay under the washing of the word and in that word nonstop day or night all the time and it will wash us friends so some of our efforts are just making us tired and i'm tired of being tired i want to run the race with patience i want to know that what god has given me is enough amen if there's something that there's something that i'm struggling with i i know that what god has provided in this day is absolutely adequate to get me to the position i have to be in in this day god could not require a position for the bride if he did not already make a mechanism for her to get to that position because she has no ability in herself so god foreknew what this bride would be in the end time and he had to send a prophet in this day he had to restore the word he had to open the seals he had to take the mystery off of god so that we would understand who jesus christ was and who we are in him so that we could live to the full potential chapter 13. let's turn there together john chapter 13. i've talked about this scripture several times but i want to put it in context here god has taken his word and he's cleansed us he's cleansed us from denominational thinking he's cleansed us from the world he has cleansed us and then he's filled us with this spirit amen but but as we walk in this world we still need god to keep us clean we still need the power of the word to keep us clean he said in john 13 verse 8 this is the last supper when before they eat the last supper jesus is going to wash their feet he says in verse 8 peter sayeth unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou has no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith in him he that is washed and he does not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so jesus had already said you're clean through the word i've spoken unto you so they were cleaned by the word but jesus gets down to wash their feet to show that they're still part of you that's still in contact with the world and i will keep washing you amen i will keep your feet you've been to the bath house you've been cleansed amen my word has washed you but you're walking through a world amen and we're walking through a world with an old nature and a fallen human body amen and things get on you dust and dirt from the road but jesus christ is there to wash you friends to keep us clean brother brown said in the message adoption part 3 from 1960 he said by faith are you saved that's your faith in god the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you clean how do you say saved by faith are you saved and that by god's foreknowledge calling you you are saved and the blood makes an atonement constantly keeping you clean if god knew there had to be a blood atonement to constantly keep you clean he would know that you constantly need cleaning so when we find ourselves in need of his cleaning power the sanctification of the word we don't need to go back to ground zero and say i'm not a believer i've never arrived how could i ever be bride you could be bribed by his foreknowledge amen your bride by his choosing amen not by your conduct the bride question was settled long ago friends you're not trying to settle it out now by your conduct what you need to do is believe what he's told you amen what he's whispered the love secret that he's whispered in your heart you need to believe it and stay in the washing of the water of the word and let that change you and then as you walk through this world and things happen and your mistakes and failures realize that there's an atonement there keeping you clean amen let's go to first john first john chapter one super familiar scripture but i'm gonna lay it in right here because it fits really well first john 1 5. this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him has no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin what do i have to do walk in the light what is the light the light is the revealed word of the hour it's his word revealed that's the light and it washes you and it keeps you clean brother bam gets a question in 1964 he's in august of 1964 and he gets questions and answers and this question comes it's question number 378 and he refers they write down the scripture of romans 7 14 to 18 and they quote it here we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i would do not for what i would that i would not but what i hate that i do if then i do that which i would not unto the i can send unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me then the person that wrote this down says this i cannot understand that's honest here's what brother brahma says well they wrote out the scripture that's paul speaking to the romans now let me just kind of polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons right one wants to do wrong the other wants to do what wants me to do and every time i start to do right then wrong hinders me how many of you people in the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing in this morning same thing i spoke on it this morning temporarily you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and this faith disagrees with all six senses if the sixth sense doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the sixth senses agree with faith wonderful but when the six senses disagree with faith then leave the six senses alone now for instance here jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man praise be to god i want to read that again because it's so simple so good he said now i want to read that because it's so good he said now jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you now listen the outside man didn't say it wasn't true [Music] that spirit your mind it doesn't say that what jesus said wasn't true he said it's not true to you that's where the real deception comes in friend it's not that your outer man that carnal nature is not denying the word it's denying the word for you they'll say it's true yeah it's true he's a healer but not this time and not for you and maybe well because you messed up you're under punishment now praise god he said the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man it's so simple we do not have to play around with thoughts amen the devil can put thoughts into our mind amen we do not have to accept them as ours we do not have to identify with them we have every right to reject that thought and say it's not the word but it is the word they said it's true no when you said it's not for me it's not the word because the person of the word has already told me who i am and nothing's going to change that so just ignore the outside man and accept the inside man now that's the same thing that paul's speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have troubles we do married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things brother brahms just now he's just breaking down every person's life the reason you've got these problems the reason you love god and you want to serve god but you've got these problems is because of that outside man and you haven't learned how to ignore him yet and stick with the inside man we've got all these problems we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit man soul inside and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subject to the word by faith by accepting what god said now listen if you ever in your own effort try to produce a promise of god you're going to be absolutely mentally and emotionally exhausted you don't produce it you accept it and he produces it you accept it and you stand on it amen how in the world were those slaves coming out of egypt amen coming under a pillar of fire how were they going to have provisions in the wilderness protection in the wilderness how in the world were they going to have water in the desert how were they going to get bread and meat in the desert amen they they couldn't have provided for themselves but god who called them on the journey had already promised to get them to the other side he didn't always explain how amen but if they could just by faith amen like the faith that caleb and joshua had and said if god favor us we're more than able to take the land you know they weren't counting arms they weren't counting tanks and guns and ammunition and sizes of army amen if they were counting they could have never said that amen because they were going against walled cities they were going against giants they were going against battlement and armor men and all kinds of armies amen but they couldn't be counting the outside man had to be laid to rest they had to believe by faith that what god said through that prophet is nothing but the truth we have to do the same thing god has called us on the journey he's called us out of the world he's called us to himself amen we're uniting with him we're moving i'm into the millennium we're on this journey and he's providing everything we need in the journey if we can just trust him and not reason it and not try to produce the word ourselves we can't produce the word we can only believe the word and accept it that's why as soon as we start making measuring sticks for what a believer is we start making people tired and discouraged so don't measure anything just trust god believe god he'll measure you up to what picture he had of you before the foundation of the world he's got to ordain you in the good works say man called you in the good works which he hath ordained before the foundation of the world he knows what you're going to do he knows what's in your life he knows the potential you have and he knows what he's going to extract out of your life you just have to believe him to do it and accept his promises for you and he'll perform the word it goes on to say how can i take a cockle burr and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockroach has been transmitted from the cockabur wheat a cockapoo to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cockleburn and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocklebur and the life of the cocker bar has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky he's talking about you friends not plants the life of the cockroach has been taken out the life of the wheat's been put in but the outside form of the crocodile is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cockroach but wheat but wheat but while it's here on the earth and out of the earth and a cockroach is still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live i'm so glad he said that and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing that's the thing friends if we could just identify with the inside man and be washed by the water of the word the inside the life on the inside will take dominion over the outside and bring it under control of the word amen but it's got to be his life amen not not our own efforts we yield to him we give him our lives but it's got to be him that does the works in questions and answers from 1961 he says but now if you make a mistake and do something wrong you don't willfully if you're a christian if you're a born again christian you don't mean to do wrong your intentions and everything is right but if you do as she said here make a mistake and do something wrong will god let you just go on and on and die like that and be lost or will he bring you back to reconciliation he will bring you back that's right he will bring you back and then if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you and you go on like that on out remember you wasn't saved at the beginning so if you're able to just do wrong and it don't bother you don't condemn you and you do wrong then you're not even saved at the beginning brother bran is putting this in perfect balance he's not saying you won't do wrong but when you do wrong you hate it you don't want it you you're disgusted by your actions you're troubled by what you did you hate the whole affair and can't wait to make it right amen that is a christian but somebody who will do wrong and just do wrong and keep doing wrong and live doing wrong and not reconcile not make it right amen and not have their conscience bothered by it and remember just assume everything's going to be fine they weren't even saved at the beginning amen that's right you wasn't saved you just had to make believe you wasn't saved but when you you're saved you have a different spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in christ and the old things has passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness you see but being you're living here in this world here there's traps set for you everywhere and you're walking with your eyes on christ and remember that when you make a mistake a real christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation so it's not that we never fall we never make a mistake we never fail but there's a life on the inside of us that is not satisfied that way that can't live that way that can't stomach it amen as soon as he makes a mistake a christian will come back for reconciliation quickly brother brahm said in the evening messenger 1963 father practically every hand in here went up for circumcision to be cut away all the surplus that doesn't belong here god help us all i stand right with them lord i'm one of them i'm watching for the coming of that glad millennial day when sin and shame shall be destroyed forever and father while we're in this world we know that we're subject to these things we're subject to mistakes we're subject to sin we're still walking and yet we don't desire to do it and as the bible said faint not when thou art reproved but i pray father that the reproving of the word cuts me just as hard as it cuts the rest of them i read this last three quotes just so you could get the picture that brother branham's painting he is not amen he is not painting the picture that that once you're born again and filled with the holy ghost you live a perfect life and you never fail anymore that's not the picture he's painting but we need a constant washing of the word because of the nature we have because of how we were born and this flesh that we're stuck in we've got to constantly be under the word we have to constantly be washed we have to keep walking in the light because the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from all sins if we walk in the light as he is in the light and we need that washing and we need that cleansing but i'll tell you this there's no place else to get it there's no place else to get it outside the light of the hour the word for our day amen we're not going to get it in a system we're not going to get it through an effort we're not going to get it the only place that we're going to be able to walk in the light as he is in the light is nowhere he is in the light and it's the light of the message of the hour and if we walk in the light as he's in the light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from all sins we've got to walk where he's walking so that his word can wash us go to acts 26 i'm just laying down a bunch of pieces but i hope that the holy spirit will help us tie it all together acts 26 in verse 15. this is paul on the road to damascus he was saul at this time and the light appeared to him and verse 15 says and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom now persecute persecute us but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen under those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles and to whom i i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me paul was sent to the gentiles with the word and when he came with the word the scripture said of paul he was a light unto the gentiles he was the light-bearer he was bringing the light of the word and when he brought the light of the word he brought it to open their eyes to turn them from darkness and to light amen from the power of satan and to god that they may that they may receive forgiveness of sins because they could not receive forgiveness of sins without the word because they had to believe the word amen and they had to believe the word that paul was bringing because that's what the lord said that they might receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me amen by his own faith amen that he put in us they were able to believe the word gentiles were able to believe the word and be saved believe the word and be sanctified believe the word and be filled with the holy ghost now now we're getting down to where i want to get to i like laying down a bunch of pieces so we've got two by fours here and two by six is here so let's start building by the grace of god i want to go to the message of thinking man's filter brother bam says in this message he said also now we want to look at ephesians 5 26 said it is the washing of the water by the word a waters of separation what does it do then the filter of god is the word waters of separation washing off the waters of separation by the word god's filter so brother man was going to start talking about we know the message of thinking man's filter he was walking in the woods one day he saw a packet of cigarettes there and the lord told him to go back and pick him up and he wanted to argue with god a little bit he said lord i i i'm not picked that up i i can't smoke i'm against that and the lord impressed him and he went over and he picked it up and on the side it said a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste and god gave him this sermon off that packet of cigarettes and now he's wanting to talk about god's filter that god has a filter and god's filter is his word it's the word of separation that separates us from sin it says then you can't come into christ through a church filter praise god you cannot come to christ to a church filter you cannot come by a denominational filter or a creed filter there's only one filter that you can enter into that holy place that's through the washing of the water by the word the word of god is a thinking man's filter the church will judge you here whether you're a good member or not they'll give you a good funeral and a half-mast the flag of your death send great wreaths of flowers and do everything for you but when it comes down to your soul facing god it's got to have eternal life and if it's eternal life it's part of the word and as as my own hand cannot deny my hand my eyes cannot deny my hand or my foot or my toe or any part of me they cannot deny it and neither can a man that's part of the word of god or woman deny any part of the word of god then women when you think you can have bobbed hair and come in the presence of god you're wrong you see it you're wrong you can't come through god's filter where you're washed by the water of the word then you enter into the fellowship you think you are but you can't be until you come through the word in every little spot every little word of god man shall not live by bread alone but by every word it's got to come through that filtration coming through and that gives us a righteous man's taste because that's what he's looking for looking for something to cleanse him so a man's looking for something to cleanse him and he says it's this word and when brother man was talking about this uh thinking man's filter he said what a gimmick he said what a why hypocrisy they would take a a cigarette and they know that it's dangerous to man so they'll put a little filter on the back of it and say that it's going to filter out you know bad things or whatever and it's only going to let the taste come through but brother bam said when the taste comes through and the nicotine the tar and it's just a gimmick to sell more cigarettes and he says it's supposed to be filtering out a thinking man a smoking thingy man's filter a smoking man's taste what they're trying to do is just filter out some of the harmful things of the cigarette so that they can still enjoy the nicotine and the tobacco and brother behind takes it right to the church and said the churches have done the exact same thing they've made their own filters so that people can come into the church and draw through a church filter and try to filter out just enough of the bad things of the world where they can still get a little taste of the world and still be safe but they've proven that those filters don't do anything because people get lung cancer by the droves on filtered cigarettes and the same thing's happening in the church amen worldliness is creeping in and they don't have a heart for god amen and they're falling away because they've taken a church filter the church says and the church says and they teach and try why why would they want a church filter because they've got a taste for the world amen why would a man knowing that that cigarette's dangerous why would he choose a cigarette with a filter because he wants the taste of the cigarette but he knows it's dangerous he meant so he's trying to find a compromise that will keep him alive amen and still let him enjoy the thing he's got a taste for and the churches have done the exact same thing and all of them are guilty of it amen they still have a taste for the world and they want us to be safe from eternal damnation so they stuck a church filter a man over top the world and they filtered out we don't do our rate in movies we just do pg-13 we don't go to rock and roll concerts that we just brought into the church and change the lyrics amen we you see they put out they put a church filter on it because they love the taste of the world god doesn't care how you dress he's only looking at your heart that's partially true he's interested in your heart i mean you could dress perfect and have a black heart it doesn't mean anything with god but if you've given your heart to the lord you've given your whole self to the lord and the spirit of god is not a filthy spirit and if the spirit of god lives in you the outside of you will reflect the spirit that's on the inside but a church filter will slap a church creed will slap a church creed and filter they'll explain away the word of god and why do people still drove to churches amen why do they why do churches fill up why do mega churches fill up because people know there's a god and they're afraid of hell and so they'll suck through that church filter because they have a taste for the world but god has provided a filter for his children that filter is the word of god and that word of god will not let worldliness through amen it will not let ungodliness through it will not let selfish desire or lust of the flesh or lust of the eye it won't let it through amen the word stops it every time brother said the only thing that will get through the word filter is the holy ghost amen and it depends on what you have a taste for and what you're desiring but if you get a hold of that word and you draw and draw from the word the only thing that's going to come through that revealed word of god is the holy spirit of god amen and if you've got a taste for the spirit of god then you'll draw on the word of god and all selfishness and and all pride and arrogancy and all lust of the flesh and pride of the eye it will all get filtered out by the word because the word won't let it in brother ma'am said the filter of this word is the waters of separation that separate us because we just take the word we believe the word let the holy ghost come through the word and wash out convert change give us the power to bring the outer man subject to the inner man we've got to draw from the right filter why would somebody draw from the word of god because they've got a holy taste they've got a taste for god and they want more of god amen not a taste for the world not a taste for a cigarette but a taste for god and if you've ever had a taste for god of god you just want another taste of god and another taste of god and another taste of god amen if you've got a seed gene of god on the inside and you've ever had a taste of god you're an addict and the moment you first had that contact with god and all you want is another contact with god and another contact with god and another contact with god that's why we come to church sunday and wednesday it's why we fellowship on the word that's why we pick up a message book and read it or play a tape what is it i want i'm drawing through the filter of the word because i want another taste of god i want his spirit his life i'm hungering for it i'm addicted to it amen praise god only the prophet of god can preach a message like that he goes on in thinking man's filter he says see what i mean a filter a thinking man's filter a man that wants to stand in the presence of god what was god's filter his word the day you eat thereof that day you die jesus had a filter in the garden of eden that would filter out sin and that filter was his word and he had a word for them to keep amen and that word listen we gotta we have to keep reminding ourselves that the word is not something secondary to god so we can say the word you know the word and then the god and then the father and the word and but you remember that the word is god and so when god gave them the word he gave them himself and when eve left the word she left god when eve rejected the word for reasoning she rejected god we've got to we've got to understand this and we've got to keep bringing ourselves back to this because then we understand the power of the word what was god's filter his word the day you eat there of the day you die don't care what's happening out there don't you pass that word washed by the waters of the word a thinking man's filter not a denomination not a creed not a church not a cathedral but a thinking man's filter for you're going to be judged by the word further down in thinking man's filter he says and god of heaven may may there not be one of them lost i claim them every one and hold them before them the filter from sin the waters of separation the blood of jesus christ the word made flesh not the word that was the word made flesh god that is the present-day word the waters of separation the blood of jesus christ the word made flesh grant it lord and may the holy spirit pour through every promise into our souls and may we be living representatives of the bride of jesus christ in the time of the eyes of the seeing in the evening light for we present it to you in jesus christ's name amen i love him you believe it if i've said anything wrong by saying thinking man's filter i can't say no more i have no education i just have to say what comes to me and when i seen that laying there i thought what a line of hypocrisy and something said just like the church so that packet saw that that saying a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste said what a line-up hypocrisy and something said to him just like the church a thinking man's filter oh my there's more than that to it a thinking man wouldn't use it at all see certainly not and it and it desires a smoking man's taste that's right because he's got to have it to satisfy his taste but a real thinking man that knows his soul is going to judgment will filter his taste through the word of god for all the father has given me will come to me and and he'll live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god which is the waters of separation that separates us from sin for when it comes through the word we see that it's sin to disbelieve it so we just believe it and go on it's a separation from sin amen we want to live free from sin but we can't do it without the word we want to overcome you know there's times that that that you see people struggling and they're struggling because they don't fully engage you see sometimes people are just on the peripheral they don't fully engage they don't fully immerse themselves they don't jump into the message they don't jump into a into fellowship and into the word and when you begin to talk to them they start to say things like well i'm just trying to work on myself you ever heard it i just there's some things that i got to get right there's some things that i got to make right there's some things that when i get this straightened out when i get this right and then you know i want to serve the lord but there's some things that i got to take care of there's things i got to get right and all of a sudden you realize you're never going to make it amen you're never ever ever gonna make it with that attitude because you're waiting for the strength the right set of circumstances the mental power or the will to overcome this thing in your life and the thing that'll overcome it is the life that comes through the word we have to receive the word and go to drawing on that word because what comes through the word the only thing that'll pass through the word is the holy ghost amen and we've got to have the life of god that comes from the word amen to give us overcoming power to wash the desire for sin out of our lives see there's a there's a tug of war many times because we still have a desire for sin but we intellectually recognize that it's dangerous for us it's not healthy it's not godly it's not a good way to be a christian and we want to stop it but there's still a desire amen we tug of war all the time and i say forget the tug of war jump into the word and start drawing from the word and drawing from the word and let god win the tug of war let god be the anchor on the back of your rope amen and pull it all to the other side where you lose the desire for sin where that thing that used to hold you it loses its grip amen for the thing that used to trip you up constantly it begins to diminish and go away many of us have experienced that but it wasn't our efforts it wasn't our ability there was things in my life i could not overcome there was things that i hated desperately hated i hated every time i tripped up by but i could not overcome it and you say how did it go away i can't tell you how it went away all i did was love this message and it went away i don't even remember the day some of these things went away there was things that i was delivered from there's things that just fell off as i walked with the lord and i can't tell you the day it fell off or where it went or when the desire fell away all i can do is look back and say it's gone that temptation used to bind me is gone that thing that used to trip me has faded away the thing that was so powerful and pushed me is not pushing me anymore what happened amen it was the sanctifying power of the word amen it wasn't willpower it wasn't effort it was a faith that this word is god and i'm gonna drink from it and drink from it and drink from it until it changes me but in order for that to happen you have to believe that this word is god amen and if i walk in the light as he is in the light then i'll have fellowship with the believers and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse me from all sin you have to believe it friends you don't have to understand it you don't have to figure it out but you have to believe it so many times you'll see somebody will be faithful to church faithful to fellowship faithful to the word and the next thing you know they're gone where'd they go months years they're gone they may come back they may not you ask them what happened well i messed up why didn't you come back to church why didn't you get back into the word why amen why the only source for you overcoming you forsook you walked away from the only thing which is the living word of god the only thing that would have delivered you you walked away and you wandered in the wilderness much longer than you needed to because when you mess up and when you fail amen all you got to do is repent and cry out to god and start drawing on that word again because it shows that you need something more than what you have don't leave fellowship don't leave the word don't leave these things just because you make a mistake my goodness the only place that you're going to find deliverance is in the word don't leave the word don't let the devil discourage you to leave the word because then he's got you separated from the word and you have no power to resist him except your willpower how's that working all you have is your own desire to be free how's that working how's that worked in the past the only thing that'll work is the sanctifying power of this word to separate us from sin and wash it away from us and take all the desire for the world out of our heart see it's so simple we don't believe it you talk to the israelite okay now you're delivered you're coming out of egypt now how are you going to get to the promised land what's the way i don't know which path you take i don't know you don't have enough provisions where we get provisions i don't know how are you going to get from here to there how many days will take i'm not sure where are you going to get water i don't know where are you going to get bread i'm not sure they had nothing to worry about amen if they would have just stayed with the simple faith they believed god when they saw the plagues falling on egypt they saw all the power of god imparting the red sea they believed him but when god wasn't doing supernatural mighty things before their eyes amen they showed that their faith was only intellectual faith because when the signs and wonders went away they didn't believe he would give them bread and he didn't believe they would give them water they believed they would die in the wilderness that's not faith but there was a couple there that believed and god proved how faithful he was to the word because every time they had need he met the need how will god deliver me from this i don't know but he'll deliver me how do you know he'll deliver you because it's in his word amen this isn't his nature amen this thing that i'm struggling with it isn't the nature of god it isn't in his likeness it isn't what he wants it's contrary to the word so he has to remove it from me how do you know how can you be so sure because he gave me a personal revelation of who he is and who i am i'm his bride by revelation and he cannot amen he cannot let me go on this way don't you think you should do this or do that or get in a program and no i don't think you should do any of that i think you should stick with the word that's the program the program has always been the revealed word for your day it's always been god's program it always will be god's program the revealed word for your day that's the program stick with it it was the thing that led them through the wilderness it was what provided their bread it's what provided their water it's what provided their protection the revealed word for the day it's what provides us overcoming power it's what washes us and sanctifies us is the word let's turn to first corinthians chapter six it's amazing how sometimes i just get amazed at things i've said and things that i've heard others say it's amazing how we can believe that god will save our souls and change our bodies but we don't believe you take away a bad habit you see how foolish that is how ignorant like somehow we believe god has got the power to change our atoms but he doesn't have the power to change my inside my very heart's desire the things i want the things i love and he can't he can't take the desire for the things of the world out of my heart see if we can't believe him to take the desire for the things out of our heart how are we going to believe him for a body change he's got to be changing us all along amen from glory and to glory he has to be changing us and we have to believe him to have the power to change us if we don't believe him there's nothing he can do for us amen brother brennan made it super clear he said if jesus christ was standing here in this suit i have on now he could do no more to heal you he's already done it you just have to accept it he even said in one place he said if jesus christ was here and you said lord heal me he says i can't that's what he said he'll say i can't i already have i need you to accept it amen the same jesus that would go into a village and heal all that was sick would come into capernaum and because a prophet is not without honor in his own town amen he he could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief so god can only change us if we believe he can change us well what's the mechanism we have to do it the way he said by the washing of the water of the word well that should make us jump up and click our heels because we have the most powerful revealed word that we've ever had that's ever been on the face of the gentiles now have the full mystery of god in their hands amen if he's going to wash me by the washing of the water of the word i would want to say i declare right now before you all it's unlimited amen it's not limited amen by by a church aged seal still being on it all the seals have been taking off amen it's not limited by a wrong understanding or a wrong interpretation of the word it's not limited and if the word is the power to wash me amen there's a power that's here to wash me i just have to believe it first corinthians 6 and 9. first corinthians 6 and 9 know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor adulterers nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves of mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you hey none of those people are going to inherit the kingdom of god but that's what you were and none of them will inherit the kingdom of god none of them have rights to come into the city and that's what you were all right and such were some of you but ye are washed amen but you are sanctified but you are justified in the name of the lord jesus christ by the spirit of our god brother brown says in the message god's power to transform he says true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they are part of that word amen all wondering stars how long will you wonder you methodist baptist presbyterian outsiders whatever you might be wandering stars from church to church from pillar to place and television to television world to world why don't you come on he longs to have fellowship with you he is longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are a part of which you are a part if that desire is in you then he goes to a scripture he said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled i ask you do you hunger and thirst for righteousness is there a longing in you to live holy and clean before him then you will be filled amen where did that longing come from it come from him you're part of the word amen you cannot deny the word and you long to live all the word you long to have the manifestation of jesus christ in your life then you will be filled praise be to god he's longing to have fellowship his fellowship was broken in the garden of eden and he's longing to have fellowship again and he's made a way that we can come back to fellowship if we just receive it his way you know there's we'll just talk about this life this life is difficult we come through if if i could just if we could just take each person's life which we're not going to do and begin to explain how they were born who their parents were what they came through the tragedies that they suffered in life the difficulties they had it would be shocking in this room people who've known what abuse is and neglect and abandonment they've been hated by parents they've been sold all kinds of evil things from childhood up they've been in false doctrine and false understanding they've been indoctrinated wrong we've had everything we've come through everything and you realize that this is satan's eden he's come to the pinnacle of his eden of his kingdom every wicked device is available and every evil thing is on the face of the earth hell has spilled out onto the earth and when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises a standard so many times what we're struggling with to serve god we're struggling with a mind that has been tainted by the world we're struggling with a spirit realm that has been bent and twisted by corruption by abuse and by neglect and by uh uh rape and incest and drug abuse and all of these things this is literally what people have gone through and it twists them in the spirit realm and to where they think that they want to serve god and they're serving god to the best of the ability and but you know when you talk to them you know that that things are twisted up inside they're not even thinking right you try to help people you try to talk to people but you realize they're not even catching what you're saying things are so twisted up in the emotions things are so twisted up in the mind that there's a skewed view of everything around them there's people who believe everybody's going to cheat them everybody's out to get me why are they like that because of what's happened to them and you you go to try to offer help and assistance and because everything you've said passes through this filter of the mind then your good intentions are are sometimes looked at as evil and you're misjudged and misunderstood by what said you say one thing and they hear something else have you ever been there if you've dealt with human beings any amount of time you've been there and you realize the only thing that's going to work is the renewing of the mind because everything all the reasoning is twisted you can come with the best reasoning the most logical statement you can make it a b c d here's here's all my evidence and here's my case case closed it makes perfect sense and i would say it makes perfect sense to you but whoever you give it to it's twisted up and somehow it's interpreted different it's not seen the same way amen they don't view things you two people hear the same conversation and walk away two totally different impressions of what was going on one person would walk away and say that husband and wife they really know each other and understand each other they can be really honest with each other somebody else will walk away and say man they're really mad at each other you're yelling at each other and it all depends on your experience right and so you can see you can't reason somebody into the gospel you can't give them reasonable evidence and reasonable proofs and you can't you can't show them all the evidence and the proof and and you can't talk to them logically some people can't even receive it so what do we need we need the renewing of our minds we need the word of god amen to come in and begin to fix amen correct change what we need was we need to think different now you tell somebody think different you think different okay but what we need to do is get so immersed in the word and let the word wash our thinking amen listen to the voice of the prophet until we can start picking up more than just the words we start picking up the spirit start picking up the nature amen there's more going on than just the words amen but the word has a life in it the word carries a spirit and that spirit is the spirit of christ and let the word and the washing of the water the word begin to wash away some of those things that have tainted our thinking and some of the wrong imagination and some of the chips on our shoulders and the hurts from the past that cause us to be critical amen let's just keep staying in that word and let the word wash and wash and wash and wash till we can be restored by the renewing of our mind amen sometimes if we've had a really rough life and a really rough upbringing and we're constantly in contention with the people around us and so misunderstood and misunderstood everybody what we need is a good set of earbuds not a counselor not reasoning amen not self-help what we need is a good set of earbuds and we need to wear them out amen constantly immerse in the word of god get an audio bible get the message of the hour stick it in your ears and don't take it out until you realize something's releasing something's changing amen i'm understanding different i'm thinking different i'm feeling different things are beginning to change in me why because we're washed by the water of the word washing out the past wrong thinking the wrong concepts the wrong doctrines the abuse and the neglect and all the things that have happened amen let the water of the word wash it amen and bring us into the mind of christ amen we try to reason with people who aren't thinking reasonably we try to give proof to people who twist every proof really what you need to say is go listen to this every day of your life all day long and let's talk again in a month why because the word can correct our wrong thinking the word and the sp not just the words but the spirit of the word and because sometimes when somebody is so twisted in their mind they don't even understand what brother branham's saying it doesn't even make sense they even take what he's saying and they twist it the wrong way when i say keep listening keep getting washed because there's a spirit that comes with that word and it is the spirit of christ and let that wash and wash and what until all of a sudden what he says makes sense and now all of a sudden i get it i see it oh i understand what he's saying now that's nothing but the truth friends that's the best counseling advice i've ever given sometimes what we need is just to immerse ourselves in the word and cry out to god and say god i don't think right i don't feel right i don't understand right and i gotta have you to wash me and you said that you would wash your bride by the washing of the water of the by the word and i need to be washed amen i need to be renewed in my mind and i can't do it by trying to think different i can't do it by trying to form different habits amen i got to have a power that's outside me and it's got to be the power of the living word [Applause] i mean if you're still struggling if it still it feels like for you you're one step forward one step back that you can never really get there that you never really progress i tell you get a good set of earbuds immerse yourself in the word pray spend time meditation and pray think on the word listen to the word be immersed in the word because the word will wash you and renew your mind we've been born in sin shape and iniquity come into the world speaking lies we need to be washed by the water of the word things have happened of no fault of our own things have happened of our own fault and it's twisted us all up on the inside and there's only one power i know to untwist and it's the power of the living word which is jesus christ manifest today throw yourself down in his feet say cleanse me lord throw yourself down how many wants to throw yourself down in his feet and said purge me with hyssop and i'll be clean wash me and i'll be white as snow i can't think right i can't feel right i can't reason right i can't make a right decision to save my life but purge me with this up and i'll be clean you purge me and i'll be clean you wash me and i'll be white as snow i'm tired of trying to work it out i'm trying tired of trying to fix it i'm tired of trying to overcome my past so many people are laboring and striving and struggling to overcome their past their own mistakes the mistakes of others and they're stuck you can literally see they're stuck it's like they're running in knee deep mud they can't get anywhere because all the baggage of the past oh friends jesus christ knows the past amen but he's got a power on earth today that can free you from all of that he can pick you up out of the mighty clay he can wash you with his word and he can set your feet on a straight path but if we neglect the very thing that he gave us to give us the victory we're going to stay in the muck we're going to stay in the mud we're going to keep going in circles and we're never going to get anywhere until we finally begin to doubt that there's power in the word until we believe that there's no hope and no help but i tell you friends there there's never been a time there's no hope and there's no help for the elect of god there's never been a time that there's not a power that can overcome all the power of the devil and god has given us if it's the word that watches he's given us the word in full measure unrestricted and unlimited by ideas of man unlimited by denominational doctrine he's given us the full revelation of god amen and i say let's get into it with all of our hearts and let it correct us let's turn to ezekiel ezekiel 36. ezekiel 36 and verse 24 for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and i will bring you into your own land now listen this is a prophecy with dual fulfillment natural to the jews but spiritual to the bride let them be talking let god talk to you right now amen don't make this listen we can label this bride okay this prophecy to the bride i want you to make this personal to you let the word speak to you i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all your countries and i will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh

that i give to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god i'm so glad he said i will i will i will i will i will gather you from the heathen i will bring you from the nations i will put you in your own land which what is our land our land is the word i i will sprinkle clean water on you you don't have to sprinkle clean water on yourself he said i will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you can you imagine just imagine god is telling you this and i'm going to sprinkle clean water on you and i'm gonna clean you from all your filthiness and all your idols can you imagine looking at him saying i don't know if you've got enough water you don't know how bad i am a sprinkling won't work i'm telling you if he said i'll sprinkle you'll be clean you'll be clean and i'll send my word and heal you he'll send his word and heal you amen quit questioning it quit doubting it amen quit looking at you look at him amen look at what he's promised not where you've come from or where you're at but what he said he would do and stick with it friends stop this i believe a little bit and then i doubt just believe and when a doubt comes call it a lie i will clean you from your filthiness and all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you i don't have to get it myself i don't have to work up to it i don't have to labor for it what do you have to do i will give it a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh you mean i don't have to fix it first [Music] and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you i don't have to go get the holy ghost i'll give it to you i'll put it in you i'll wash you i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to and cause you to walk in my statutes he didn't say you better walk in my statues he said i'll put a heart in you i'll put my spirit in you and i will cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that i give to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god he didn't ask them their opinion he didn't ask for their help he just told him he would do it and they had to believe it god told us that he was going to have a word bride in this day she was going to be washed by the water of the word and she was going to be called sinless virtuous the spotless bride of jesus christ and he doesn't need your help he didn't ask your opinion he said he was going to do it always looking for somebody that will say be it unto me according to you i believe that lord if that's what you want that's a witness in my heart amen and i'm saying it's nothing but the truth let's go to hebrews chapter 2. i hope the devil is losing ground today i hope his tactics are being revealed i hope his attack plan is being unveiled and i hope he's losing ground today hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one we're going to have to let that soak in for he that sanctifieth and those who are sanctified are all of one how do you know it'll sanctify you because you come from the same place you have the same origin you have the same father you've come from the same source he that does the sanctifying and he that's sanctified are all of one how can he not sanctify you god cannot lose himself that's why he's promised to do it that's why he won't let you go both he that sanctify then those who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praises unto thee god's not going to lose you he that sanctifieth and he that sanctified are of one whatever he is i am whatever that word is that washes me i'm the same thing i've come from the same place brother venom says in the invisible union of the bride of christ said you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place oh i want to shout within myself that's the truth that's the truth amen you never sin at the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with the pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he that sanctifieth and he is sanctified or of one that he might take you then he might receive you take you which would predestinate in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of god called love it says your first wedding was annulled it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be god come down himself and took your place in a form of the son of god jesus christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you going to be washed you're still as spotted as eve listen he sent the word to wash the word will wash but if you don't stand in the water of the word if you don't stay put and let the water wash you how are you going to be washed you'll be just as spotted as eve then he quotes a song he says oh dear dying lamb thou precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god will be saved to sin no more what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you and you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word [Music] he washed you in his word he purified you by his word to make your mind and heart stayed on him and stayed on his word why because he determined he was going to have a bride see eden in eden they were in a justified state because they'd never done wrong and they believed the word of god in eden they were pure they were holy they were sanctified they had the presence of god walking with them every day they had justification sanctification baptism in the holy ghost and then eve left the word see what ruined what ruined this relationship what ruined this position with god and his children what was it is when she left the word and then she went and committed adultery but adultery was the attribute of sin the sin was unbelief in god's word so when she disbelieved god's word she sinned and when she sinned she had a had an effect in her life and that effect was seen as adultery so god is trying to put us back in an eaten condition and to put us back in an even condition he has to justify us by faith he has to wash us with the washing of the water of the word and his presence has to come to dwell among us and walk with us what is god trying to do he's trying to put us back in an eaten condition what caused us to get out of an eating condition leaving the word leaving the word left us out of an eaten condition what will put us back in an even condition it's going to have to be the word amen it was rejection of the word put us out it's got to be acceptance of the word that puts us back in that's why the word is so important brother man talks about the word the word the word and we hear the word the term the word so much but you realize it's the it's it's god it's the very thoughts of god it's the very essence of god amen and she left god she left the word she left the essence and program of god when she left the word she left him when she left the word she left his program when she left him she left his thoughts when she left him she left his desires and now the only way to get back to him amen is to accept his word amen the word that he presents to us in this day is bringing us back to an eden condition where you can say you never sinned in the first place he's taking us back to a first place condition he's taking us before the fall why she rejected the word came to fall now we accept the word what word all the word listen eve when she rejected the word she rejected all the word say what because she rejected the word she rejected the word for her day she rejected the manifestation in her hour she rejected the word that was given to her to keep that day when she rejected it she rejected god but now when we accept the word that's given for us today when we accept god as he comes in the revealing of his word we accept him and he declares us righteous sinless virtuous as if you've never done it putting you already in your soul in an eaten condition you were trapped into it it was no fault of your own but you proved that by reversing what eve did by accepting the word that i bring to you in this day amen and rejecting the reasoning of the devil and rejecting the devil's lies you you are accepting the lord you're accepting god and you're coming back into that condition that eve took us all out of i say god thank you for this hour to be on this earth when i see that when i see the plan of god when i see what caused it to go off in the beginning and i see the plan that god's brought in this day to bring us back i say i want to draw from that word more and more and more and more because that's what he's given us in this day there's our overcoming power there's the life of god on display today it's the power to overcome it's his plan for this day it's his program it's his thought it's his essence it's his personality it's him and we want him and the message things that are to be he said it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and the bible said so jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride i'm glad he didn't stop there he's got some more things to say so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word in the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it and i say that's for me that's my portion that's my law in life amen i may still be stuck in a cocker bore shell amen there's still be it may be a sticky nature that sometimes will get tripped up and sometimes this and wrong signals in my understanding but down on the inside of me that's who i am that's my condition that's what he promised me and that's what he's doing in this day and i say amen you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus amen how can you say that amen how can you say that when you fail how can you say that when you make mistakes how can you say that with the doubts that are in your mind i say it because he said it i said it because he would do it i say it because he said that he was going to take me from the heathen he was going to bring me into my land he was going to put a new heart in me he was going to put his spirit in me he was going to cause me to walk after his judgment and he was going to dwell with me and i was going to dwell with him that's how i can say amen because he said he would do it and i see him doing it he's changing me i'm not what i was he's changing me desires are fading away desires for the world the desire for him is growing i say lord let me draw from this filter more and more and more as we wind down can we just say in our hearts purge me with this up and i will be clean take your word lord and wash me with the washing of the water of your word and i will be clean god you told them that you would take out their stony heart i said god take out my stony heart you said you would put a heart of flesh put a heart of flesh you told me you would give me a new spirit give me a new spirit you told me you'd put your spirit in me put your spirit in me lord cause me cause me lord to love you cause me to obey you cause me to receive your word lord lord let me draw from your filter and take that water and wash me lord wash my mind amen wash my spirit realm wash me all the way down to my soul purge me lord and fill me with your spirit why because you said you would and you promise to live with me and i'll live with you and i believe it and i say amen purge me with his sop and i will be clean wash me and i will be as white as snow if you don't do it i have no hope if you don't come on the scene there's no hope for me if you don't give me that heart if you don't put your spirit in me if you don't make me to follow after your judgment i can't do it lord it's got to be you but somehow i know inside that that's what you want to do something's pulling me something's drawing me something's letting me know down on the inside this is my lot in life this is for me that this message is for me say god purge me with hyssop now that i could be white as snow let's all stand musicians if you could come let's just pray lord jesus god only you know only you know god what you're doing in this hour and who you're drawing you know lord who you're speaking to in this hour you're speaking to your bride lord there's many of your bride that have been trapped in all kinds of horrible circumstances that's affected the spirit realm and affected the flesh but god you sent a power in this day to wash it all away so many of us lord have been twisted in our minds and twisted in our emotions lord by by circumstances in life and things that we've allowed and things other people have done but god you sent a power in this day to change it all you sent the power to overcome all the power of the devil you sent your word lord and that word can wash us clean you sent a prophet that would say that that we are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ that we never did it in the first place and god i want to go to my first place condition but i pray that under the sound of this word lord that you would begin to change hearts and lives that you would prick the hearts of your children lord that you would put put in there a will lord to draw from your word that you would put in there a heart and a spirit lord that would feed on your word and that you would cause us lord to obey god we're asking all of us are asking for you to wash us purge us with hyssop that we'd be clean and wash us that we'd be white as snow god i pray that you would keep us under the washing of the water of the word and you would continue to sanctify us and purify us and clean us lord as we walk through this life when we have that old nature i pray if we stay under the water of the word lord that it would keep washing us clean as we walk in the light as you're in the light lord that that blood would keep cleansing us lord that we might have our feet washed on a daily basis lord as you keep us clean through your word oh god i pray that you would send the agent of your holy ghost to every heart lord that they would commit themselves to you that they would surrender lord that they would lay down all the efforts and all the trying lord they would just accept you except your word is the mechanism that you're using to wash they would have an insatiable appetite for your word lord that they would feed on it and draw from it around the clock and god that you would take that word and wash us lord cleanse us make us new creatures in christ jesus god we commit ourselves unto you we commit this word unto you we commit this congregation unto you we pray god that you would do what you've promised to do for us we accept it now by faith then we rejoice in it in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen spencer if you'd like to go on around back brother kyle let's just sing [Music] mercy [Music] i should fall in my [Music] one more time [Music] mercy [Applause] [Music] i should have fallen in my soul cast down blood mercy [Music] oh mercy [Music] i should [Music] well god bless you all um tell you a little bit what happened here uh spencer called me on friday and uh he wanted to talk he said he had some questions about this message and brother brahman we got together yesterday at cracker barrel we just started to talk and as we began to talk you know lots of questions and you uh after a while i i just asked spencer i said spencer i i even have lots of questions still i says but the question is do you believe what you're hearing to be the truth and spencer said yeah i do i do believe it's the truth and as we began to talk he said he expressed in his heart over the last year that he has wanted to be baptized multiple times he said but i just have too many things in my life i'm not ready to i can't come and approach him like that until these things are dealt with and i i began to tell him i says oh buddy i says you're approaching it the wrong way and brother bob baptized me about 11 years ago and most people don't know when i stepped into this pool i still had a refrigerator full of beer back in my garage and i hadn't done anything with it yet i had lots of things in my life i was still bound up with that i couldn't free myself from but all i knew was i believed what i was hearing was the truth and i wanted to take that first step and commit my life to the lord and let him do what he wanted to do with it so spencer's come the same way he believes what he heard is the truth and with all his heart he wants god to lead him from this point on so he knows that that first step is water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ so that's what brings us here today so spencer quite a service for today huh god really confirmed the things we spoke about so i'm gonna baptize you and you just hold right here i think hold your nose are you okay with that okay he's kind of big for the pool so i told him this is going to be tough so let's just bow our heads for our word of prayer grace is heavenly father we come before you we're thankful lord that by your grace you're still calling you're still polling you're still whispering your love lord to those who will respond to it father lord knowing that your heart's desire is to be loved father no one can be forced to love lord you you present yourself and lord you flash the light of your truth and the revelation of your person upon spencer's path and lord he over time has realized that that's the truth that's the correct path and father god today he wants to take his stand in the midst of the people lord and be identified with you lord so lord i believe that his testimony is true and his works here is his faith being expressed before the people so lord we are honored and privileged to take this time to to baptize him jesus name amen spencer look to me buddy because you love the lord and you want to be identified with his present tense expression of the word may manifest in this day i now baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ heavenly father lord confirm your word lord we simply have come lord just believe in your word we can do no more than just believe your word father and lord you've hid yourself through the ages and the simplicity of just your hidden word lord and you revealed yourself to simple people that would believe it so father god we present to you spencer and lord we pray that you would confirm your word by filling him with the holy spirit leading him guiding him changing him and delivering him being his strong and mighty tower father god being the one that will overcome for him father lord express and live your life through him we pray in jesus name amen [Applause] amen like
