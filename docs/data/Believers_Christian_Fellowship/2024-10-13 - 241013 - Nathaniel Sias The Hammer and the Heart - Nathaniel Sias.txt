we're looking to you with faith this morning God I'm here as just a vessel but Lord The Vessel be yielded to you it's all yours Lord you can do with it as you please Lord help me to step out of the way Lord may you may you bless not only the speaker but the hearer also for Lord Jesus it's a supernatural thing because the message is not from man to man but it is from God to man Lord you said if you had the vessels that you would perfect the Saints Lord may you perfect us just a little more today may we take a step closer to you and when we leave this place may we go rejoicing with the testimony that I met God once again today he spoke to my heart he changed my life for the better I can do nothing but praise him because he's magnificent he's glorious he's faithful Lord Jesus we ask that you have all the praise and the glory we commit Our Time Lord and take our little thoughts and break them Lord as you did with the disciples Lord we can read the scriptures all day long but until the spirit break it open for us Lord we can't understand it we can't see it for truly what it is but Lord your spirit is here your word is here now we pray Lord that you would break the bread for your children in the name of Jesus J Christ we commit it all to you amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you musicians God bless you Saints I greet you in the name of the Lord It's been some time since we've been able to visit with you here so I greet you and I just I appreciate the testimony that you're here today you're pressing toward the mark of the high calling it God never promised that things would be easy he never promised that we wouldn't have trials in fact he said if they've done these things to me they'll do more to you but he also promised he would never leave us he would never forsake us and I stand here before you today to profess that that testimony is true yes that Jesus has never left us the message that he gave us gets sweeter every day his Spirit gets more present more personal every day I'm here as a testimony and I appreciate each one of you being here we'll be praying for you we ask that you continue to keep us in prayer up in the Lorraine Cleveland area just keep us in prayer and we're striving to grow in the Lord and we are praying for you also wherever the Saints are GA gathered we know that God is Not constrained by the Four Walls of a building this is not the church the church is wherever those souls are gathered together Born Again born into the body looking for that coming day when the trumpet sounds Lord our work is done it's time to go home it's time for a honeymoon are you looking forward to that day praise the Lord God is so good if you have your Bibles let's turn to Genesis chapter 1 very familiar scriptures but we're going to start here because of course we like to start in the beginning as we know it is the seed chapter to all of the all that is to come I ask that you'd pray for me today we have uh some of the thoughts of ministered at home but we have quite a few things we're going to try to bring together today and the picture is really simple when the Lord makes it simple see if it's us it gets really complicated sir and then you walk away from a service saying that was really deep what was it about I have no idea you know we're not here for that we're here that God would be personal amen because the message that God gives you on Sunday is for Monday you think God's going to be surprised by the trial that you have tomorrow no so if he gives you a prophetic word he's going to give you a word today to overcome tomorrow and Tuesday and Wednesday when you come for a refreshing you can say that God gave me Deliverance because he told me what was going to come ahead of time God is that kind of faithful God praise the Lord here in Genesis let's look in chapter 1 we're going to read verses 1 to 4 just to begin laying a little bit of a foundation again we've got some thoughts uh uh I've tried to organize the thoughts here as best I can but we could go in a thousand different directions and by the grace of God again we want it to be simple we want the children to be able to leave today and say I got something out of that we want the the saints that are soldiers scarred up and been walking with the Lord for 50 years we want them to walk away today and said I got something out of that because again our God is that kind of God so here in Genesis chapter 1 we're just going to read verses 1 to 4 once again very familiar verses but as we like to do we're just going to take one aspect of this and then kind of follow it through the scriptures Genesis 1 and one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form I want to stop there just for a moment and emphasize that that the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and again I want to emphasize that that God divided the light from the darkness may the Lord bless the word you may have your seats I want to emphasize today this aspect that we've just read here in Genesis that God formed because there's a very simple aspect of God being the Creator and everyone would say or not everyone but those that claim to be Christians that believe in creation that God created the heavens and the Earth they would call God the Creator I think we would say well that's relatively simple but see all of the times when we say that we believe things if we truly understand them the way that we think we do our lives will reflect it because when we understand that he is the creator we understand that he's the one that formed we understand the implication we understand the authority that it took to create I would challenge today if any one of us here today truly had that settled in a heart you could never be sick right you could have symptoms in your body but you would never be sick because the Creator made me sir when you understand that fully you can understand that no devil in hell could ever have authority over you because they're not the Creator that's right you see the simple thought that he's the Creator we say well yes we know but when God begins to unfold it truly to us in a personal way suddenly you have overcoming power in your daily life that's right Lord today we're going to cover really these four parts and again I've done the best I can to to try to organize this and we could go a thousand different directions but we're going to cover today really four main points the maker the heart the hammer and the keeper and our thoughts for today will be titled the hammer and the Heart the hammer and the heart and again we're going to cover this in four parts the maker the heart the hammer and the keeper there are so many things about life once again that I grew up in the in and around the message one could say but again we have to even look at the way we say things we we say things and they're comfortable to us I'm in the message but if you're not born again the message is not in you to be in the message I will be with you even in you to be in Christ and Christ in you you must have sold out everything that you have there's nothing that I value more than him Lord truly I want you to have preeminence now we may struggle with that in the process of adoption and growing and placing of those Sons we may grow in that process but Saints God has preeminence we we've given him that we've sold out we said Lord there's nothing there's nothing I can do it's as simple as coming to the Lord we we would say we uh uh many of us maybe have talked to someone maybe led someone to the Lord and introduced them to Jesus Christ but even that simple process of leading we would say a simple process of leading someone to the Lord who are you introducing them to on what basis are they coming see the Old Testament saints were justified by sight no by faith amen they were justified by faith what does Justified means it means as if they never did it amen they put their faith in the word that came to them and it is putting our faith when we started our journey with Christ it's putting our faith in what Jesus Christ did on Calvary we have such confidence in that Saints and let's stop there for a moment well that's Elementary brother when we've got our ABCs in order but Saints understand that if you have that in order you would understand that you can never be depressed right well well we do have an understanding of that but we're growing in that understanding brother Nathaniel why are you stopping and emphasizing these things because the most dangerous thing that we can do in a as a Christian is say I got that I understand that I can say today that I understand what God has given me thus far and that thing that I'm holding is only going to get bigger amen it's only going to become more profound so as we look at these thoughts today we again like I said it pray for me we can go in many different directions we we had a service last night at home and we got on the road uh I don't remember what time it was but we got into the hotel about midnight last night we uh our little guy he was four years old was was uh had a fever this morning at about 6:00 a.m. so of course we're up a little bit early and we were a little bit tired today so I appreciate your prayers but you know as we were talking I was talking to brother Chad and brother Jeremy stopped by to say good morning and appreciated that very much you know at this point that's old news if you go to work for the Lord guess what the devil's going to do if he can't get you he's going to get it your children he's going to get your wife he's going to get it something so if you know that you're going to go work for the Lord expect trials now you're not asking for the trials you're not looking to pick a fight right we're not looking around hey where devil where's the devil at no no no but if you cross paths with that devil now you've got a word to stand on Sir so these things I just share that with you just to see that the devil's already fighting but you know Saints you can't have a victory without a battle do you believe that God is Victorious and even saying amen is to claim there has been a battle there has to be a battle we have to acknowledge it we have to be okay with that and we're okay with that so we're a little bit tired today and again I just just appreciate your prayers to uh there's many things that we can preach on you know anymore the challenge is not finding something to preach on in in my notes anymore I've gotten to the point where I I have I have all my notes I have a a lot of things written down and I'll get to the point I'll say dot dot dot enough it's not done it's enough it's enough for one day this is what we can handle for one day there's so many good things that we can handle is God good I just appreciate the warm wel welcome that we got this morning it was uh talking to the brothers in the back and and uh brother Chad was just so warm and welcoming I really appreciate that Saints again the devil fights everywhere and it's good to be with Saints of like Precious Faith so let's go if you would to Colossians chapter 1 we're now going to start digging in a little bit and and maybe building our subject we're going to build a subject that might take a little while today but we'll also have some fun along the way you believe in having fun in church I do I don't think there should be anything that we enjoy more than being in Church Holy Spirit starts to good starts to move and I've just start feeling so good I start to laugh everyone's different but that's how it fits me I just oh my heart is so happy I don't know what else to do Colossians chapter 1 we can have fun in church our God is a good god Colossians chapter 1 let's read verses 13- 22 now this is of course talking about Christ here who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature let's pause there there just for a moment he is the image of the invisible God just hold hold that in your hearts just there for a moment verse number 16 now for by him were all things created oh he is the creator we're talking about the sun now that all that are in heaven Let's uh verse summer 16 again for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible and in invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him amen and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell let's also hold on to that and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by by him I say whether they be things in the Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by the wicked works by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight again so many things that we could stop on but we're going to emphasize a few things here all things were made by him we're going to reiterate I'm sure many of you are familiar with the picture but again we want to be on the same page here because brother brandom describes this scene that in the beginning the father who is all things he speaks and the son is created and this is the logos describes it like the pillar of fire comes into being but I want to look at this one aspect of that process today that of course we know that the trinitarians would believe that Jesus Christ uh the the ex of God he is eternally a son brother Brandon was very clear on that and just highlighted the Simplicity of the fact that a son has to come from the father otherwise it doesn't make any sense as it Des describes again again in the trinitarian doctrine they are co-equal and co-eternal so Eternal sunship of course again that's not true he was expressed from the father God began to form something as we read here in Genesis and the the rest of Genesis articulates that all of the process of God creating all of creation but God began in his mind he had a thought and when he had the thought he began to form things to his thought amen so he formed that that logos the expression of God again for John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God so we know what the word is we know what the logos is so it's not two separate things but again from our minds as a in a human thinking we already begin to struggle because now it seems like there's two this is the the aspect of things where the trinitarian doctrine gets people sucked in because it seems to explain things from a human perspective it seems to make it make sense and then you have a prophet that comes along and says oh Eternal sunship doesn't make sense oh you're right it doesn't how simple is that does it ever Astound you just for a moment does it ever Astound you how much that brother bandam would pick things out like that now we know where it came from but you understand Saints it's not because he was a genius he was just connected to the right source and the things that he's talking about we're now trying to express and explain and and break it down but the Simplicity of of this thought that God was the self-existing one and he began to form but now I want to to highlight this aspect that from of course the logos comes all creation he expresses himself he forms this this this uh expression of himself and then from that comes everything else as we just read here in Colossians but this aspect of God forming being a Creator just for a moment we're going going to really dig into that thought because God is the maker right of course he made the heavens and the Earth he made you and I he made the air he made everything but when God formed the things when he formed them he defined them he set their boundaries he said you are this every form of life was then set and and sub subject to an authority of a rule every seed must produce after its kind you can only be what God created you to be you can't be anything else well why can you not be anything else because God defined you God defined me God defined all of creation when he set things in order he formed it and in the process of forming forming it he was defining it he was limiting the extent to which it could do things in the natural sense you can't fly like a bird God didn't make you that way but if God wanted you to of course you could we know that Elijah ascended up Jesus ascended up they saw it there's many witnesses but God set in this natural world he set things in order and he formed things with limitation but now I want to really let's take out the microscope and really zoom in on this thought just for a moment the maker has made and he has made because he has authority to make he has authority to create and the thing created is now subject to that creative Authority because he created not because the creation asked not because the creation bargained with God but the act of creating has now set the thing in order and the thing is subject to God because it was formed by God his creative Authority set the bounds set the structure set the characteristics of every single form of life amen and every single form of life is subject to the creative authority of the Creator right but what is the one being that's not subject to that yes that's him yes he is the creator that's right the Creator is not subject to a higher authority so the Creator can change his form as he pleases if the Elohim the self-existing one wants to make himself into the pillar of fire he can do it if the pillar of Fire wants to form himself into a body of a person he can do it this is the aspect where people are trying to wrap their heads around how God condescended and became a man they cannot wrap their heads around God himself is not subject to another creative power God himself is the creative power sir he can change form he can make form he can set the limits of form and he can change it at his pleasure obviously we see in the Garden of Eden that the form of the serpent was changed why because it had corrupted something and God said that'll never happen again so the one with creative Authority changed the form but no one else can do that only the one holding the creative Authority can do it the creator has exclusive creative authority to set the form of creation have we got that now praise the Lord but he being the Creator with authority to Define what form life will take can change his own form amen it's simple yet we get lost not understanding sometimes that he is absolute in author Authority Saints how many times did the prophet say just take him at his word just take him at his word just take him at his word thousands thousands of times are we doing it 100% of the time we're still growing what are we trying to latch on to to hold on to to understand that his authority his Integrity is above all things and that he all of of of creation we look at creation and we say oh the body hurts but you understand that this was created and therefore because it was created it is subject to the Creator amen and though cre corrupted though Satan has tried to steal it corrupt it uh Mar it it's still subject to the Creator no matter what happens no matter what we go through no matter what the trial is he is still absolute in Authority he's not partial in Authority the only thing that God is obligated to is his own word there's no other authority that is above him he can change things as he Wills I'm I'm literally at a loss for words because there's a thousand different things that we can say that's so profound in my heart God God is over everything see we know it but do we know it because when you're in the midst of the trial when you're depressed if you're a minister when you're down on a Monday right because the anointing is G is gone from from you in that way to minister and now you're at home and you're feeling alone and you're feeling down in that moment is he still the Creator brother sister when you hit Monday you're back at work and you find that you hit Monday and the devil's just coming against you had a wonderful service on Sunday you get to Monday and oh everything just hits is he still the Creator then that's the thing that God wants out of his children when we understand exactly who our father is he's Absolut in Authority not partial he's not bargaining with creation he's just absolute when we're resting in that there's nothing that the devil can do that's right amen but we live in a world that is trying as hard as it can to corrupt itself right but if you look at it in this perspective Saints society that the world that we live in today is trying to change its form in every way what is it it's a rebellious world trying to rebel against the authority of the maker I can be anything I want no you can't you can be what God made you to be well I don't believe it it doesn't matter what you believe because creation is still subject to the Creator nothing has been out of kilter all things have gone according to the way that God permitted it to God has not done wickedness but he's allowed Free Will so that uh we have the opportunity to make that kind of choice this is from 1965 and knoweth it not all the fullness of all things is talking about Jesus all the fullness of God all the fullness of the angels all the fullness of time all the fullness of Eternity everything dwelt in him that's this fellow God changed his form God condescended he limited himself he didn't know all things why because he's a God he is the god he's the Creator he can do that so he did it that's right and people say well but how what do you mean he's the Creator he can do whatever he chooses well how does this and he's talking to himself he's doing this he's a Creator he expressed himself he's not subject to a higher authority we got that right I know I'm taking them taking a few minutes we're we're really pounding that nail in because so many things are built upon that amen now let me introduce you to this plant our thought today is the hammer and the heart and today we're going to describe this plant represents the heart God has created the world he said in the beginning God created male and female amen male and female created he them why do you think it is that God presented himself in this age even the age itself is referred to as the bright age why do you think that is why do you think it is that in this age Satan is fighting every day to destroy the idea of what a man is and what a woman is why do you think that is you think it's coincidence no Satan has had thousands of years to watch what God has doing why do you think he's trying to corrupt the very vision of a man and woman and why do you think it took a prophet to come and and describe the a proper relationship and and a and when God be uh uh began to express to us that God was calling us and that we were in his mind in the beginning and and we were uh we have a relationship first as it seems to us as a servant but he said I don't call you a servant anymore I call you a son well praise the lord it's a it's a more mature relationship but there's a relationship that God at the end has described himself in the church it's a bride and a bridegroom coincidence see this relationship is based on the choice of the two people so today we're going to just go through a few examples the world is again trying to corrupt this in every way that that they can but there's so many spiritual things that God is doing this has been on my heart for quite some time and not in a in a in a sense of trying to respond to the world but yet in the on the other hand if the devil is trying to attack a subject it should raise our alert why why is this happening so for today's example I'm going to again I'm going to introduce this is the plant this is the heart now this is going to represent our sisters you see in the world that we live in today people are trying to express that a woman needs to have a career she needs to be a career if she's going to have children she can work and maybe have a babysitter raise the kids but you see God formed God defined and God defined something that's so unique and special that he couldn't create it firsthand you go back to marriage and divorce and it sounds almost harsh the way that brother manam is explaining that the woman was a byproduct of the man and he's using terms that he's trying to express this thought but understand something saints that God did not create you in the in the moment God did not create you with no adversity no no uh uh how would you say it with no choice he gave you Free Will and he couldn't create that firsthand he had to create a creature that was so unique that's right that it had the choice to choose God or to not choose God the uniqueness of this creature where in the world that we live in today people are trying to emphasize the independence of the woman try trying to to to uh add value to what it means to be a woman you know the more revealing that you dress the more beautiful that you are what they're really saying is the more lust that you can provoke the more beautiful that you are they're equating Beauty and lust right that's of course we know is not Beauty but the world is trying to add to these things and and the world is saying well you can have a job and you can have a career and I heard someone referring to this they had talked to a woman that was had two degrees and she was a CEO of a company and and as The Story Goes she was almost crying in the interview because she said I go home to an empty house I don't have anyone that loves me no one that cares for me see in its most basic Bic form Saints people are trying to change their form what they're saying is that the the form that I was created in is not good enough so I'm trying to change it but I want to emphasize today when God made something that was so special you could not force it to be he himself is God being the Creator he has all authority to change all things he could not would not create this thing in its finished form he created with the capacity to be that finished form but it had to make its own choice it had to go on a journey Jesus himself was perfected by the things he suffered there's a process that God has has has defined there's a process that God has described to us and that process as we talk about today is adoption your salvation is a was written before the foundation of the world when you're converted you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's an event something takes place you don't walk away from that the event saying I wonder if now there might be a time where you don't understand what happened and you have to grow in that but there's something that changes so much in you you walk away from you say something's different I may not be able to say what but something's different but now as God has come into your heart that if that the Lord is is dwelling in you you now begin to grow into the revelation of what God has done in you and it is that process that god holds so precious and God made a woman as a byproduct of a man and you you might think uh again as the terminology brother benam used well it almost sounds like the waste product or the extra thing no no no don't allow your mind to go there that's not what he was saying that's not what God has expressed God confus or or people get confused with the scriptures say that the woman is the weaker vessel and and the people have gotten this idea that the woman is the Lesser vessel that somehow she has valued less that's so false that's absolutely wrong God does not believe that I can prove it to you if you were going to buy something and you said I want to buy something I want to buy this clicker and let's say I don't know how much it is let's say it's $30 if you have $30 in your hand and you're willing to buy this clicker what you're saying is the price I'm willing to pay I I I value this more than the price I have yeah and God laid down his life to purchase you so how does he value your life more than his own so the idea that a woman is less as in lesser value is so completely false it's a man's idea a self-serving man came up with that idea God never communicated that and and humanity is tried to build up or change or or Define value because they lost the vision amen of what makes a woman so special and again we're going to represent it this way in our flower the heart you try to try to form this try to make it to be what it is it won't work you have to start with something small and you get in the right conditions and it grows something we're very familiar with right the seed must produce am so to further explain this this uh picture that we have here brother random says in 1960 he carth for you man was made to want to be comforted who made him the maker right what image was he made in image of God if a man was made to want to be comforted what about God it's not good that God that man dwells alone why is that God wanted Fellowship we could say another word for Fellowship is your heart comforted when you have Fellowship absolutely you want to express yourself and you want that person to express themselves to you it is the relationship that is the value so let's see man was made to want to be comforted so then if he doesn't accept God's way then he'll make a way for himself and he'll try to substitute something to take the place of that Holy Spirit oh I want you to listen to it a man or a woman that will not accept the Holy Spirit the comforter will try to comfort themselves with some violent substitute that Satan will present to them Satan has got plenty of substitutes but why do we have why do we have a substitute when the Pentecostal skies are full of the real why would I eat from a garbage can when I have a clean table is setting full of choicy foods why would we try to change what God made now maybe you or I in the Integrity of our heart we don't want to do that but what we're talking about today is do we truly understand what exactly God was trying to achieve so now I have another part that we're going to use as an example today and and I haven't communicated this ahead of time so I don't know if I should apologize or brother John small can I have your help come on brother he didn't get a warning so he doesn't have a script ahead of time we didn't practice in the mirror before service I understand brother that you are a contractor is that true general contractor oh we need a microphone let's see here okay I turned it on Blue oh somebody's good you ever seen one of these yes just want to make sure his hands look like he seen one of those before what is this it's a hammer it's a hammer okay a MILF so what's your experience with one of these depends on the day sometimes it's used as a driver and sometimes it's used as a puller how many years have you worked with a hammer um probably in excess of 30 I don't know exactly so rough estimate how many times have you swung a hammer no clue a lot now you all know our brother but to prove the point our brother has a little experience with this tool we all agree now I'm going to ask you brother specifically as you started to say specifically what is this it's a hammer what kind of hammer is it it's a framing hammer what what other aspects does it have you start to say about the face and different we talking about the name of the hammer or what it does name of the hammer it's an ox Hammer treat treat us treat us like we don't know anything about Hammer okay so this is a 22 o framing hammer it's a straight claw hammer and not a curved claw hammer which is typically used for uh framing for the most part the face of it is actually a checkered face instead of a smooth face you wouldn't use that for trimming anything because then you'd have what we call mule tracks left behind when uh when you drive that in so uh and it's a has a wood hand handle which today is kind of looked down on cuz it causes a lot of vibration that goes all the way through you and ruins your shoulders I have to get a new Hammer yeah 20 you need a 22nd century Hammer so you can use it to drive Nails uh you can use it to persuade boards to go where they don't want to go you can use it to uh pull nails if they're crooked or need to come back out again and uh sometimes we use it like a hatchet because it is a straight claw so what type of work or how big of work could you do with this Hammer how big of work is in what what types of things could you build with a hammer like this or would you use a hammer in the process uh I mean the size of it wouldn't matter because you start with one piece at a time so sure yeah so you could build small you you mentioned it would be a finishing Hammer might be a little bit smaller on the scale of hammers how big is this Hammer fairly large for until you get into the big hammers but as far as Hammer that you're going to use every day it's it's fairly large okay so let me ask you this one have you ever hit yourself with this Hammer a hammer like this not this Hammer but Hammer like this a hammer like this one like this yes did it hurt most of the time yes how bad did it hurt on a scale of 10 sometimes it's a 10 it depends how you hit yourself sometimes it's a three so let ask you this if someone wanted to do damage how much damage could they do with this Hammer a tremendous amount yeah like you said you could rip things apart with it you could probably kill someone with that hammer I'm sure it it could be a very dangerous element sure right okay so we're going to right here now now brother what is what is this I have no [Laughter] clue I'm not sure I've ever seen one of them before looks like it's a holder for a screwdriver look at that so what could could you do with this I mean it's a hammer after all right you could probably put a very small nail into drywall to hang a picture with that hammer could you build a house using that it would take a long time he's being very generous very generous I mean I yeah it'd be tough it would be tough yeah it'd be tough so how does this compare to that as far as usefulness as far as the East is from the West it doesn't compare it doesn't compare yeah no I so which one would you rather have on a job site then we already know the answer but go ahead brother brother the Joe does his hammer look familiar I would rather have that on a job site because that one's useful right yeah it has a purpose it was made for a purpose and while we probably need a better hand more updated handle the type of hammer does a tremendous amount of work it could do a lot of damage but it could also do a tremendous amount of work that's what I needed brother not much damage with that so God made a man to be this man was formed to have a tremendous amount of potential to build but a man is always also made the inherent nature of the ability to build also means the ability to destroy this is dangerous that the world has come up with an answer to this problem as they see it God formed man to be a man to be masculine to be tough to be able to build things to create things to to put the wood together but he can also hurt destroy damage kill it's a dangerous thing so the world has looked at this danger and the world has said that's so dangerous we want instead of this we want this do you see the problem this is not made for the job God made a man with a purpose to protect a family care for a family and when the bear comes you go get eaten first yeah yeah that's your job Brothers take it up yes God called you to stand at the door and when the Devil Comes you say no no no you have to go through me first God called a man to be a real man not to be some diminished sissified version because you lose its value but now Brothers God made us to be this and we get in a relationship and we get married and then your wife starts crying and you just want to fix it and you're like here I am what's the problem how do you think that's going to go over now be honest now Brothers how many have done this look around young men there there's a testimony and what happens when you try to fix the flower with the hammer yeah you hear the testimony other brothers already testifying it's the truth right we get ourselves in trouble because we're trying to apply the way God made us in the wrong way amen we're trying to fix the problems of the Heart by changing the form of the heart amen but God formed already something special yeah God does not need your personality to change the form of it that doesn't mean you don't interact that don't me doesn't mean you don't have a part but it means you cannot change the form the maker has already made the form God made your wife as a jewel amen and God forbid someone might say well not my wife well brother why don't you treat her like one you treat her like one and you see what happens or it might take a while but see Brothers we never want to admit that we're the one that accidentally smashed someone's toe what' you do that for well I was fixing a problem you got in the way right not my fault I'm just being who God made me to be and sometimes in a relationship we go at the flower we go at the heart we say now wife you're crying there's a problem but see we try to fix the heart and the only thing that the hammer can do to the heart is hurt the heart that's all it can do so what are we supposed to do I can't fix this this if this if this plant were dying it's fake so it can't die but if it were dying what could I do I can't change it with a hammer is not going to do me any good but you know what I can do with a hammer in the middle here in uh in Ohio it might be the middle of December you know what I could do I could build a greenhouse I could build a safe environment so that the heart doesn't have to go through the heartache that it's going through and sometimes Brothers we need to create a safe environment for our home and you God did not call you to be this to make your home well I got to be a little bit more you know sissified no you don't I'm not saying don't be gentle where it's appropriate I'm not saying that the Bible instructs us to be gentle to all men but there's a part in US brothers and sisters that gets so corrupted because men are walking around trying to fix a problem that you can't fix directly God did not make the woman directly he made her inside of Adam and then Drew her out but we want to just make it it's a problem I'm going to fix it and we can't figure out why we cause problems right but now if we have a the problem is not the hammer who made the hammer the maker that's right how much Authority does he have absolute right he did not make a mistake when he made the hammer the only problem is what is the hammer hitting because in the hands of a skilled Craftsman that hammer can make beautiful things in the hands of a psychopath it can kill right it only matters who wields it but God has formed these things has formed the gentleness and the the the capability of being a mother in a woman and the world has looked at it and says I don't care about that what I care is about you go and make a second income so we can have a two income home and we can live like the Joneses no offense if there's any Joneses here right yeah the only reason why that continues is because and understand financially there's times where that's necessary we're not talking about that we're talking about when the choices of the individuals they're choosing that over something else and the reason for it is because the Beauty and the gentleness and the incredible beauty of what God made is not appreciated see if you're if God Made You Brothers if God made you to be Hammer but you don't understand that that woman that God gave you to live with is his daughter if you think first and foremost that's my wife I can do whatever I want you have a world of problems yeah amen but when you enter every conversation in life you understand first and foremost she's a daughter of the Living God again you might say well brother my spouse is not converted treat her like that anyway she'll never experience like have an experience like that anywhere else in the world because if you're treating her the way that God treats you yeah amen amen that's right well my wife did this and and I just I got to straighten things up God doesn't come to you after you're converted God doesn't come to you and said yeah I made a mistake when I made you you need to dramatically change who you are I said after you're converted when you're converted God comes to you and he expresses his plan to you he expresses his Plan of Redemption he Woos you and he never stops we've said this before and it's just something that's blessed my heart did you know that love is not an emotion but love brings emotion and without emotion Love Is Dead doesn't that put us in such a perfect spot we can't be off to the left we can't be off to the right because you say you love your spouse and you have no emotion when they walk in the room you have a problem yes I'm just being very blunt with you today is that okay right we have a problem Saints you can't change something you can't grow if you don't acknowledge I need to grow right and I'm not certainly not talking down to anybody I'm not trying to beat anybody up what I'm saying is this is the reality of the world that we live in why is the devil attacking this amen because if you have a revelation of your relationship between you and God then that Revelation must translate into everyday life you cannot treat your family like garbage and then claim to have a revelation of who God is you can have all kinds of spiritual experiences tell me all kinds of testimonies and if your family is not care for that you you don't care about your family I'm not talking about just making a mistake I'm saying you don't care yeah amen you know why I'm preaching these things brother sister because these are things that I love my family I love my wife I love my children but these are things that I look at myself and I I look at myself personally and I think I'm not a very good husband when I look at how good God is when I compare myself to him Lord Jesus well we're we're focused on just growing spiritually we want to grow in Revelation praise the Lord I understand this I'm not knocking that now just making a point yeah we get so caught up in that that we miss that the revelation God is giving us is to change the way we act it's supposed to change the way we conduct ourselves we should not be conducting ourselves the way we did 5 years ago we should be more mature we should be more gentle when it's appropriate we should stand we should have a backbone the world will tell you as a man that you shouldn't have a backbone you should be like this that's right well don't disagree with somebody you're going to hurt their feelings Brothers we are at the point where we should be able to disagree right we should look each other in the eye disagree on doctrinal things I can't talk to that person they see that different did brother brandham ever have that attitude not a single time brother brandham never did it how can we have it then right because we want to get in there the truth is we want to fix it that's right yeah come on now well they believe it different so I'm just going to throw out I'm going to throw out seeds what we're doing is really poking that person yeah yeah this and this and this and you know it's getting a reaction I say you Brothers brothers that are here I say I say that sisters could do it too but sometimes we are prone to do that as brothers right but we have to understand that we set the right environment that we have given been given incredible power amen now sisters we're getting a more for you okay sometimes we brothers sisters just maybe let you let you in on a little secret sometimes we Brothers we need someone to say put your big boy pants on Brothers am I right there's sometimes there's something in us that says yes you know what you're right you're right I did do that I've got enough integrity and humility to admit it and you know what I'm not going to stay the same cuz there's one person that I can change that's this guy right here and as much as God will give me Grace I can take that personality that I have I don't want to drop that on my computer there it can do damage maybe you didn't catch that this can do damage but I I can apply everything that God made me to be I can apply that to myself right so sometimes we men we need some tough talk a little bit and it's good for us no I'm not saying you understand what I'm saying I don't I don't believe in going so far and being disrespectful or abuse one another that's not godly but there's a there's just an honest about being men that makes you stand up a little straighter it's good to be around a man that's got good Integrity who and talk straight I think every man in here there's probably older men that you might respect and they're just men sometimes quietly but they speak the truth you think Lord I want to be more like that I personally think I talk too much when I get older you know what I I pray I said Lord Lord when I get older I want to talk less but say more and as I get older I want to ask more questions because sometimes we're doing this what we're doing is really we're trying to fix a problem instead of inviting into the right atmosphere so that the Sovereign God one plants one Waters but God gives the increase so that the Sovereign God can make the difference that's what our homes should be but now thank you brother John that was wonderful spur of the moment we've talked about the hammer can the hammer change the form of the plant it's not made for that God set the form of the heart God set the form of the woman to be precious to be gentle why so she could love those children in a way that you never can a mother can be a mother Brothers we can't be a mother you can't do that for your children because God made a woman specially to be that now let's go to Mark chapter 6 we we okay so far praise the Lord we're still going somewhere we're not there yet Mark chapter 6 just say Amen when you find your place there praise the Lord uh Mark chapter 6 let's read verses uh 2 to 3 and when the Sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such Mighty works are wrought at his hands is this not the carpenter the son of Mary the but brother of James and and uh Joseph uh of Judah and Simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him many times we think about Jesus the son of Joseph the carpenter that's not what this says says isn't he the carpenter I want you to think about that for a moment you mean to tell me that the god of creation who has the ability to set his form in any way he wants he condescended he he become the logos and then he made all creation and when he created a body and stepped into that body he he created that he stepped into that particular body and he came and worked as a carpenter why would he do that because even in life the character of who he is is coming out see he's a maker he came to Earth and the the the attributes of the father are being reflected in this body in this form that he formed a man can build a house a man could go and you could build a a beautiful home can have the lighting just right you can have colder lights and warmer lights you can have nice warm lights you can light some candles in there and if there's nobody there I don't care how much you crank up the HVAC it's a cold house because something's missing that's right a man can build a house a man cannot build a home a man can take the Timbers and form the house pound the nails cut the boards put on the siding the shingles etc etc a man can do all those things but he cannot it's impossible for a man to make a house into a home yes let's go to Titus Chapter 2 for Titus Chapter 2 just the one verse there verse number five to be discreet this is talking about the sisters well let's we'll back up a little bit to verse number three just to give a little context the age women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teaching teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed so who keeps the home not the man I mean man has his part of course right but this doesn't say this about the man says about this about the woman this is the keeper oh friends amen you see you could build a house and it's going to be cold why because love isn't there and the When Love Is there when a man when we get married and and the woman is there and she's starting to keep the home she's caring for the home she's cooking in the house doing whatever that she's doing in the house and maybe the man comes home from work and I I know I've come in the house before and it smells like something good is cooking it just it does something to your heart you know what but if you take that woman out of that home does it stay at home it does not it is the Act of her keeping the home it is the act of her keeping the house that makes it a home amen you say well brother in every situation no you can have a marriage that has no love in it that's possible but we're talking about the way that God intended it yes and we'll get to a little bit more of that in just a moment but just bear with me for a moment you see because here we are as men we can do a lot of good things God made us this way but God did not directly create Eve he created Adam and Drew Eve from him because she had to be made special she had to be formed specially because she had the sacred trust to bring forth life she was made to be more gentle than the man well that means she's weak no it doesn't isn't the Bible talks about a virtuous woman she's strong in a different sort of way she's not supposed to be masculine supposed to be feminine and the beauty of what God made that woman to be is what can transform a collection of building materials into a place that a man will yearn to be only her presence there makes it that amen amen the woman keeping the house makes the house a home now let's go to John 14 praise the Lord Jesus John chapter 14 praise the Lord oh my blessed be the name of the Lord what a day what a time to be living Saints amen all the ages past they never got to see these things right they never got to see the whole mind and heart of God uh unfolding they got to see only that little part we get to see the entire mind of God the mystery would be finished my John 141:4 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know he says I know you know where I'm going and you know how to get there but he's ascending up to be at the right hand of the father yeah he's caught up and you know how to get there and he said I go to prepare a place because he is the maker amen you see he created he formed but it is the process of discovering it is the process of the wooing it is the process of winning the favor that causes love to come out it is the process of it God did not just create it the Angels Praise Him continuously but the Angels don't know Redemption they are only bystanders they don't know the process they were not lost and then found but here God is he's looked at us and he says you are out in the world I never lost you but you were tied up in sin you were connected to sin but I came along and cut the connection prise God and I'm going to prepare a place but without you amen without you it's not good that man dwells alone from the beginning God had a yearning what is he yearning for he's yearning for his house to be a home amen amen and how can his house become a home it has to be kept yeah that's right someone has to keep it amen and then there's this little lady that comes up out of leod deia prise God and she's she meets God and something happens in her and spiritually speaking she starts walking around like this people look at you funny why you walk that way why you going to church why you dress that way why do you do this why do you do that groaning to be delivered why because something is happening on the inside she was given a sacred trust and she has kept that sacred trust God has given his mind his heart he's put everything into her hands and she has to keep iten hallelujah it's only the Bride of Jesus Christ keeping his word that will make the house for God because he was alone he did not want to be alone he wanted to have someone he could turn to and say I love you and she says I love you because I've known something else I knew sin I knew all the other things in the world but you gave me your word and I kept your word amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen that's so beautiful Saints I have no words oh my Saints because God gave us his word and it rest in your heart you you're the keeper you Saints you're the keeper of his word you're the thing he was looking for he wasn't just looking for someone who's going to be a good person he wanted to have someone who would hold him in their heart that he could walk within the cool of the day he could explain the ins and outs of creation look what I built over here honey you did that that's amazing you should say that to your husband husband once in a while you did that oh wow that's amazing but you know what we won't have to put on for God we will look at the Grandeur of the heavens and the Earth the tapestry of the heavens the tapestry of all time and look at God and say your creation is wonderful the beauty of it is beyond compare no one can compare to this maker he formed it he made it he made it beautiful he formed it why because he had a thought in his mind that one day someone would appreciate amen amen someone would take his word and hold his word in their heart and it was the process of keeping it that made it precious God did not just snap his fingers and make a church that loved him he wanted to come and woo he wanted to win so that when you give your heart God is the God of all creation he can do whatever he wants he can form whatever he wants but he didn't form just something else he formed you who did that the maker did amen well I don't like how tall I am who made you well I don't like my eye color who made you it doesn't matter what your insecurity might be you might look in the mirror and say I hate the way I look well congratulation you hate God's creation that's God's creation well brother we were made in the spirit being and then formed here who caused you to be formed here we said this in the past I believe I mentioned it here who who defined Jesus's eye color who defined that every detail is of God Amen every detail about you is of god God permitted every little thing about you we get caught up in our insecurities I want you to take your step back from your insecurities brother sister take a step back and realize that it was the maker that formed you in that genetics the moment you were conceived it was already written how tall you were going to be what your eye color was how astounding is that the maker did it he's forming he's building and the at least as his bride we look at his creation and say Lord you you are amazing amen amen you are the maker you set the form you set the limitation you created even this thing that's wicked that chose to be Wicked Lucifer fell you put us in the world why so that we could overcome amen if there was no temptation you couldn't keep it but you were put here as God's most precious thought so that you would come through the process fall in love with with him and then keep his word amen hold it sacred and in it God would win what he was after we've looked at today well before we we we'll draw to close here in a few minutes 1965 things that are to be oh but the other one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house now let's stop for a moment let's read this like a love letter from God oh but the other one is called my father's house I'll go to prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists a perfect place calling you to that Perfection you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be perfect must be a perfect people to come amen because because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the word the the word of God bleeding word to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect amen virgin yes unadulterated she never sinned in the first place praise God Amen she was trapped yeah into it amen there's the father's house that he's gone to prepare the hammer and the heart God with all authority to form to create to change he set you set your limitations God did not make a mistake he's never made a mistake we look at our ourselves and think what a mistake but I challenge you today the maker made you he formed you knew you before you were born today it says we will cover but we have covered the maker God is the maker he formed there is no Authority that he is subject to he is the highest author Authority all things created are subject to the Maker's Authority he created the heart the woman he's created to be to uh to to bring forth life with a sacred trust to bring forth those the the the life that nothing else can the man can't do it man might be involved in the process but he can't do it he can't bring forth the life she's made to be a mother to be caring and people have confused us to be the Lesser V she's not lesser she was made precious to be precious to care for the young ones to care for loved ones in a way that a man never could excuse me the hammer we were made menant you were made with potential to be dangerous potential to hurt to potential to harm and the world wants you instead of being this a framing hammer something that could build and destroy the world wants you to be this but God didn't make that that's a cheap copy of what God made and then God made us the church as a type of course our sisters as a beautiful type of what God has made that God has made the church to keep his word to hold his word and it is the keeping of his word that God was after this whole time someone that would love his word to care for it to care for it to yeah praise God to nurture it so it would grow to care for it amen to bring forth life yes Lord and every little punctuation amen I care about that amen amen I care about that why why are you so sensitive about his word cuz I'm the keeper amen God gave me his word so that I could keep his word can you see the vision of that Simplicity God handed us his word he says now you keep it and it's you keeping it that's precious prise God God is good the hammer in the heart that the musicians come if you would I ask B but a song leader to come and thank you praise the name of Jesus isn't he glorious God is wonderful it's personal well brother what what what am I going to do you know tomorrow I got to go back to work hold it in your heart you know what when before someone gets married you can say well you're not married yet but their mind is on on the marriage oh you're just living in the cloud Saints I think it's time for the Church of God to be living in the clouds just caught up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well what are you thinking about you thinking about the news I'm not thinking about the news I'm thinking about his word that came to me I'm thinking about Lord I want to be a better keeper today than I was yesterday tomorrow is Monday I want to overcome greater tomorrow than I did today because God has given me his word and his word is growing in my heart I want to care for it I want to nurture it and no one else can do it the maker formed me the maker made me let's all stand together if you would just pick a song There Saints maybe if we could maybe bow our heads in a word of prayer maybe the play that just for a [Music] moment he formed my heart let's just go to the Lord in prayer and maybe by the grace of God if something has pricked your heart today you say Lord I need a bigger Vision Lord I want to be a better keeper I Want to Hold Your word in my heart I want to love it I want to be more tender I don't need to fix your word your word's already perfect let's bow our heads in prayer if you have something in your heart you like to make known to the Lord you can raise your hand let us pray together Lord we lift holy hands and we express that we have a need for Lord you are the maker and you formed us Lord we've tried to do it our own way many times we try to produce the word Our Own Way many times but we can't do it we can't make the word we can only produce the word we keep it it produces [Music] itself Lord Jesus You're So Perfect in all your ways Lord you're you're an amazing maker Lord creation is beautiful Fallen as that may be the sun rises and it and it testifies of you Lord we're going into fall it testifies of your death then spring will come by your grace it will testify of your Resurrection Lord you wrote your word in the stars and the heavens at creation wrote it in the pyramid wrote it in this written word and Lord as it unfolds to us us it's astounding but Lord in
