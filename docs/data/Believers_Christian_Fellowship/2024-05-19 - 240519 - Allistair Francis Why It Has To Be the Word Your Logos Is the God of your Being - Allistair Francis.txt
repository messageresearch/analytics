get enough of it amen amen and so may God feed us again I just appreciate the last two Services here on dimensions and how they just completely opened a different channel of understanding for me and I feel like God has opened new territory and I want to go explore it because there's a lot that I don't understand a lot of pieces were placed out there and I say God I need your help because this is wonderful amen this is glorious and I want to see you I I I really want to see you as you are not what I've imagined and not what I've seen in the past but I really want to see you unveiled I want to see you as you are and all of your glory and God it's going to take more of your word washing away so that I can see you amen praise the Lord God is so good amen we're going to invite our brother Alistair to come we want him just to step here and just to come into a place where he can trust in God and rest and and if we pull on the word it'll help him enter into that channel faster and and we want to see what the Lord has for us again this morning and receive it so God bless you as we turn the service over let's sing a song like Oh Praise You praise you let my love praise you praise you praise you praise you praise you let my love oh praise you one more time oh praise you Glory To Praise You Lord let my life you praise you Blessed Be Your Name Lord Praise You [Music] [Applause] PR let my life oh Lord praise you let us bow our heads precious Heavenly Father we once again approach your throne room of Grace with humility with Worship in our heart with adoration Lord our souls are bowed down to you the very essence of our Natures our thoughts are being bows down before you we acknowledge your greatness we acknowledge your magesty your strength above all strength your power above all power we acknowledge your love for us your Tender Mercies your longsuffering without complacence Lord your wondrous mercies upon our families upon our homes upon our church we love you Lord with all that is within us we give you the preeminence because you have been more than life itself to us your word is The Treasure of our souls oh God and so we give you the preeminence this morning we thank you for such a time as this in such a Dark Hour of the world we are walking and standing in the brightest light that has ever graced the Earth this light exposes all things this light permeates our beings and shows us all the darkened corners of our characters oh God and brings it all out and exposes in your presence and we don't feel ashamed we don't feel shy of anything we're willing to be scoured out oh God and brought into your presence and molded in shap made clean more than anything father we love to hear from you speak to us this morning give us of yourself teach us more of your nature oh God be with us as we read your word we need your spirit to make it plain bless us now father bless all these wonderful people they Pastor the deacons office holders mothers children husbands may we just come in the unity of the spirit as we approach your word this morning we ask it in your glorious and precious name the name above all names the name that sets captives free the sweet name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen the Lord bless you let us read Matthew chapter 4 verse 2- 4 for our scripture reading Matthew 4: 2-4 and then also 1 Corinthians 1: 21 I certainly appreciate all of you very much and uh um I never may never get to know all of you personally uh in the flesh but that doesn't really matter because from here feels like I know every one of you in the way it's supposed to be and uh just knowing that people love the word is everything your reaction your amen and your questions amen it's beautiful the fellowship has just been wonderful so I really really appreciate you and the songs that were sung I from the from the moment I landed and brother Chad and brother Dan picked me up it's like every single day every part of our conversation was about what I was preaching and nobody knew anything and the songs that were sung even the one this morning it's just and it means so much because you come here with this nervousness and this you know questioning yourself and what are you going to say how are you going to say it but then God's people just places it perfectly for us so I really appreciate it Matthew 4:4 and when he had found fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen do we know what it really means do you know what it means to to live by word it's this is not Christian theology this is actual reality and that's what we're going to speak on today let's read 1 Corinthians chap 1: 21 so first he tells us we have to live by word then he tells us this for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so even calling we have to live by the word and yet it's called foolishness amen the Lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated amen so this is going to be the subject we're speaking on why it has to be the word amen I'm really excited to speak to you about it why it has to be the word and the title your logos is the god of your being and I want that to be the reality for every believer I ever meet for the young people why it has to be the word the title answers it because the logos your logos is the god of your being amen amen and that's what we want to explore this morning so I trust that it will be a blessing uh to us so I just want to also say um and and nothing here is going to be directly a continuation of the last two services that we've done but I trust that doing Dimensions so I did Dimensions here in two Services back home I did a service on each Dimension and a series that lasted um a month or more so I know that you have the the teaching to fill in all the gaps I'm just going to encourage you from everything that was said of course it's meant to give you questions it's meant to give you probing it's meant to make you reconsider what you thought before it's not meant to confuse you or change you because you're the bride of Christ nothing can nothing can make you disbelieve the word everything that we say has to bring something to question to probe to move on do not become the people that say this is what I believe I'm not judging beyond that the word says take every inch of ground don't be satisfied sitting back and saying I think I've got what I want now don't tell me anymore fight for every inch of ground this is the land that is given to you appreciate every single part of it and if he's given us his word I want to enjoy every single corner of it amen and I trust that's going to be something my dad told us brother Steve as we grew up and we and I and I really appreciate that about him he said to me Al whatever you believe put a comma never put a full stop because we are mortal and God is always revealing when you think you know something question it again and that's what we would do every night of our lives with him at Family altar discussions on the word probing probing robing questioning questioning questioning fellowshipping he would learn from us we would learn from him we would learn from one another but we never stopped fellowshipping on the word so I know there may be some of the things I missed even those those crude diagrams that I put up I um one of the questions that came up was uh did you put eight Church ages uh because I had you know those eight circles with the and no it wasn't Church ages those were people in the church ages originally when I did the slide I had 20 then I thought I had to put the text on the site so I cut it down I didn't even count how many there were so no I didn't put a church ages it was it was people people with the Holy Ghost amen but I appreciate the questions and the questions that came up it's really wonderful to see how you don't miss a beat this is good you're listening glory to God Amen so to get to our subject why it has to be the word and I think being message Believers we have I have taken this for granted uh all my life because uh I was born a Christian whatever that means uh became a a message believer uh and we got used to sitting here in church and and the Lord calls us foolishness this the foolishness of preaching if the world looks at you right now they think you're crazy that you you waste 4 hours sitting here all facing one person behind a desk he looks like any other Idol worshipping Oracle to which you are giving obeisance it looks terrible it looks Pagan it looks like you're just another foolish Gathering of people you should be out there it's nice and warm doing something in your shorts you know riding a bike or enjoying your life you only have one life that's what they they think uh and uh enjoy it while you have it this in every sense is foolishness to man to be sitting here and look at you I'm speaking things you don't know me you're nodding your head in agreement what's going on why should you be agreeing why should you be saying those weird things like amen you know so we grew up with this in the message we took it for granted it became um uh uh almost tradition to us but you know when you receive Revelation eventually it becomes reality but so it occurred to me you know I want to make us understand why the word is so important why it has to be the word and it occurred to me that there is a reason why people no longer Place such importance on the word So when you say things like there is a famine in the word in the church in the land it doesn't sound like such a big deal what do you mean we got the tapes we've got this we we go to church what do you mean there's a famine we're hearing different preachers all the time right but are you hearing the word and what does the word do for you and why does it have to be the word because you know people are going to come up to you and say okay fine you've got the word but what about the Miracles shouldn't there be a restoration of the abundance of the Miracles what are the Miracles going he didn't say man shall not live by bread alone but by many miracles no it has to be the word amen the it wasn't Mary didn't say be it unto me according to your Miracle amen amen there's something about word and we're not talking about some Supernatural thing that's floating around we're talking about actual word what is word do you even appreciate what it means that's what we're looking at so I want to be honest with you this morning and speak directly to us this is not going to be a teaching with pictures like before so you better stay awake uh it's not going to be um another kind of teaching that's going to uh convict you or something like that this is going to be Fellowship amen this is going to be talking about human nature this is going to make you appreciate what the word is to you personally amen and I'm going to trust the Lord to bring out all the thoughts that he has placed in my heart I want to also say I was telling brother Chad this message that I'm about a speak on I Was preparing this from 22 specifically for your church I hadn't preached it back home and I was driving after brother Chad invited me the first time and uh I was driving and then I realized these thoughts are coming into my head and I'm going to forget it so I started recording in my phone so I've got three audio recordings on my phone of my thoughts as I was just talking them and then later had to start listening to them all over again to catch a thought and then the sermon began to build up so it was specifically to you and so after that I did preach it to my church because I came here the last time and didn't because I was preaching with brother Daniel and the Lord led us in a different way but here it is today amen and I believe that it is for us amen so I want to tell you with this message where you are in the message and what's expected of you today because it can get so confusing like almost like a weird dream right sometimes coming to church our relationship with God it's it seems mostly surreal we talk about it but it seems like a lot a large percentage of of what we talk about and what we feel and what we experience is beyond our natural sight and it's almost like we have to convince ourselves that it's there like you don't see God physically you don't see him literally you don't describe his Essence we don't really know that what do you actually have you only have church you we don't have any more prophets walking around with sticks and pillars of fire we don't have those things of the Old Testament where people look at experiences and get frightened by it and and have to deal with with with respect with it and so on we don't have those things anymore all we really have is church is one another is listening to the preaching of the word so it it seems like a lot of like maybe if I could put it in a percentage probably more than 50% of what we believe and what we talk about looks like it's it's invisible yeah and you can't live in The Invisible yes we say look to the Unseen what do you even mean by that right and so when you try to force yourself to place your faith in something that is not real to you personally your faith is weak it's got to be real you've got to know how it affects you you've got to know why it's important to you that's why our question is why it has to be the word amen so I want to go to our first quote you can follow with me the prophet says in spiritual food in due season it's just the same thing that David did this morning with the oxcarts got away from the word when the word was presented and give to them they did not want it therefore they had gotten away from it that's what these people had done in the Days of Elijah gotten away from the word this is condition of message people today today yes sir they thought they had the word yes but didn't have it amen we have the word we have the word but many of us don't realize what we have glory to God there are several things here and why is he saying these things because of what happened to him and the Seven Seals because after he preached Seven Seals you know what he went through with his friends and the church and everything around him he's actually telling that generation they thought they have the word but didn't have it he's trying to bring it to them and they're not receiving it amen so he's warning the people at that time 1965 that they've gotten away from the word he says when the word was presented to them they didn't want it and he explains why why did they not want the word when he brought that why do they not want the opening of The Seven seal why do they not want the seven Thunders because they thought they already had the word yeah right amen why do they think they had the word because whatever they had they felt was working for them right amen this is the danger because the word that you receive is your god am it's the logos of your being amen let's go to the next quote paragraph 163 the mystery of it as paragra 163 uh spiritual food and due season the mystery of it is those seals each one of those churches made an organization and got into it and that's one of the secret things that been wrong before God you see it Dr Lee see look it is that that's the thing right there that's one of the secrets they organize and see was completely out of the will of God and that will be exposed in the last days and lead the people not to a Creed or a denomination but back to the true word and here it is and a true word will come to a certain group of people and the son of man will reveal himself in the midst of them amen amen praise be to God Amen the son of man will reveal himself in the midst of them why it has to be the word why does it have to be the word because he will bring the true word to a certain group of people and then he will manifest himself he will reveal himself like the song was sung today he will come into Plain View am amen amen so I want to talk to you now about the effect of words why it is so important a why word is so significant and I and I promise you after we done speaking you're going to walk away and you're going to have conversations with your family you are going to change your life like never before because you actually don't appreciate what words are we this made me think about everything that happens in my life God so let's start are you ready for this okay now we're going to talk about human nature everything and I want to say this we're not talking about psychology psychologists are robbers pardon me for any budding psychologist here God already knew about the brain so everything that they come up with all the enzymes and the names and you know epinephrine and and cortisol and uh serotonin dopamine those are names they made up for things that God created and God already knows how it works so we're not when it come to human behavior brother R said it's been the greatest part of his life to watch the nature of people amen if you're a Son of God Nature has to stand out to you you have to be able to discern nature you have to be able to decide what it is you have to know what it is so when we talk about human behavior a lot of believer say you know what this is psychology no it's not psychology this is the reality psychologists copy what we know they just don't know that all right so let's talk about it first let's make the observation there's no other species on planet Earth that communicates with words let that sink why does it have to be word there is no other species yes yes parrots can talk but they don't know what they're saying okay we know that even a crow can call some word or something but they have no idea they don't communicate with each other in words they they do things by association they'll say something just cuz you give them a peanut but they have no idea what you're saying right we are the only species that communicates with word we can communicate with actions facial expressions in fact your babies when they are born they start to communicate with facial expressions uh crying right and then slowly you start teaching them language Say Mama D da right and you start teaching them and they can you can you remember their first Expressions when you tell them to say mama it's like right look at they don't even know but but sooner or later they realize that words are important for them to communicate something to you yeah but um we we communicate by hand actions gestures facial expressions eyebrow movements eye rolling mouth smile frown um um uh stepping body language stoop shoulder chest out all those those are Communications but you can have all those Communications and people place more value on what you said right words don't just make the largest and most important part of our communication but they affect our mental functioning and our soul praise God Amen that's why I said it's real why does it have to be the word our soul is where your nature is programmed amen where who you are is programmed a lot of your nature you take from your DNA you'll find you'll see a whole family when they talk they all talk like this and you'll see the mother does that all the children talk like that oh one hand here like that oh you just see it in the DNA they have this thing that happens it's transferred by DNA but do you know your DNA has information coded in you in the genes of your father and your mother and it it very much affects how you think and feel and react to life around your DNA has has information from your ancestors which is passed down to you your DNA has the viruses that your great great great ancestors pass down to you it's in the it's encoded in the DNA you are susceptible to certain things in your blood because of what's in your DNA but do you know that words seem to have the power to even make you live contrary to the nature of your DNA Amen in other words words can recode [Music] you you know that at one time people people um believed in something and they believed in that wholeheartedly and the Next Generation began to talk them out of it and by the Next Generation they were not believing that anymore they were not even living by it because the words that passed down the information recoded them yeah that's how powerful it is let's Express a little bit more of it first let's talk about the negative effects of words you'll notice children that are brought up with harsh words develop characters that show low self-esteem anger rage nervousness cruelty to others if you if you constantly bringing up a child with sarcasm or constantly berating them for something you'll see those children when they come and if someone shouts they Flinch it's the words that that's that's been encoded into them daily that creates bodily reaction those words and the way they are being parented is going to affect their interpretation when they listen to other people it so affects your being that it affects your interpretation of any words you hear or read That's How negative words words affect children you can actually tell you walk into a classroom of children at a school and you can tell immediately by their reaction to a teacher what their word is at home children brought up with lies and deceptive language grow up being deceptive and manipulative and never understanding the value of Truth you can just never get the truth out of them and it seems like they're always wheeling and dealing like to be able to get something they have to come up with elaborate stories and because from the beginning they're just brought up with lies and deception the word that they receive in their home is coding them we have chosen to set limits with words you don't realize how much we do this we made it a norm like for example in your American society I remember reading uh from from the time I was a child I think reading American literature where you had when it came to like courtship and dating I don't even remember what it means but what it you define a relationship when you say you're talking to her what does that mean but it seems like oh we're just talking I know okay you're having conversation no no that's a definition of a relationship uh and and then when it's dating I don't and then when it's committed it's got another it's like you've got to even Define your relationship with a person by words and it's you say oh okay that's funny it's amusing it's not just amusing it's very important because the public seems to need to know whether you're talking because now how seriously do we take you or we're just talking to each other and then do not say you love her if you're just talking why what's the problem right because just saying those words produces an incredible power that happens between the two of them and people and Society are going to hold you to it because now it's like okay once you said you love her you're married to her it's over it's finished you can never go and and be with anyone else again so just guard yourself if you're just talking don't say you love her words and does it really but it was like Dad Mom but what if I feel it I'm not allowed to say it no no no no just protect yourself because once you say it it's over but you're feeling it right words we play Such value on those words I love you in a relationship well today I tell you it's it's ridiculous everywhere you go if you at work at families people who don't love you say love you it's used like it's so offhandedly love you love you love you it's not even carrying any value anymore because it's become a new greeting you you might as well say hello you know but why do you think that we are exclusive the girl says you know one person will say why do you think we are exclusive I didn't even tell you I loved you and she's saying but your actions prove to me I can feel that you love me but I didn't say it that's the value of the words it's at that point to guard your feelings and be cautious and but we will insist that words must def find the status of our relationship did you realize you do that but I didn't say it the negative effects of words Saints are immense words cause Wars you see those silly games which politicians play press conferences why do they have to have a press conference when one guy test missiles in the ocean because words are supposed to appease him and is not even speaking to him they're speaking to the media in their country to appease a guy across the ocean because he testified missiles into the ocean that's the games politicians play they use words to prevent Wars to cause Wars to cause stock markets to react just words words can make grain go up and down in the stock market grain they cause separation words say sa cause separation of families words cause isolation of individuals words causes depression in individuals words causes anxiety do you understand are you getting to understand why word is so important to the human being on the other hand if you look at the positive effect of words positive effect of words is spoken of in the Bible constantly proverbs 15:4 says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life a wholesome what is that mean it's going to bring forth fruit it's a tree of life a wholesome tongue a tongue that speaks goodly words is a tree of life amazing and now watch a child who is brought up with good speech good language no swearing no slang words of honesty words of integrity that child will grow up secure confident happy unstressed no depression no need to lie comfortable telling the truth comfortable confessing when is wrong easily apologizing easily loving someone easy communicating sitting comfortably across a table no hidden agenda just being brought up with positive words and I don't mean perverted praise like when he like when he makes something that's absolutely ugly and he say wow you're the best in the world you're amazing no you should actually that's good son but you can do better that's better words right and know if he runs in a in an athletic race at school and he comes last you take him out for an ice cream and say well you're fantastic you came out last don't worry you try you need a trophy for trying he's going to have no problem coming out last for the rest of his life you're not telling him the truth man I know your American public is is going wild with that kind of thing positive reinforcement and I don't know what else right so a child brought up with good speech the child will become a teenager that will not be confused in relationships but will be able to read people correctly and be able to tell lies from truth and not be manipulated by deceivers not be taken by pedophiles and all that they'll know hey this is what mom and dad taught me there's the distance here's what I've learned in the word here's the distance they'll be able to make healthy boundaries teach them good speech amen incredible yeah the child will not need to seek fulfillment in drugs and alcohol and fornication if you see people who are able to communicate at well they are well set together people because they were grown up with real word good word right you should know this because the Lord Jesus said word is a seed you know that and a seed if it's planted will bring forth if it's negative word it's still negative seed if it's positive word it's positive seed we're not just talking about the Bible we're talking about your everyday speech it's all sewing seed all right let's go to the danger of how words are expressed so have you ever heard people tell you know when you're talking to someone you say something to someone and uh and they tell you you just said something to them and they say to you so what are you trying to say what are you trying to say and you're saying I just told you what I wanted to say what do you mean what am I trying to say and why are they saying that you are trying to say something when you just said it are you not speaking clearly enough even though you felt like you said exactly what you mean they're saying what are you trying to say can see some of you know what I'm talking about it's because the way you express words causes those listening to misinterpret what you saying and change your meaning it's like saying I love you they're going to ask you what you're trying to say right because the way you're saying it is is affecting your message what you're transferring to them right and it's because the way you express your words causes those listening to misinterpret what you were saying and changing your meaning do you realize preachers for preachers like us how often we are in peril because every time we're behind here we worried about what you think we are trying to say all the time probably the most criticized people on the planet are the preachers of the message so it's because the way you express your words now here's something and this is the beautiful part of it what you don't realize is that to every word you speak magically it's a bad word but I I can't find another one right now magically to those words that you are speaking are attached emotions and those emotions go into the person who's listening and can cause them to misinterpret or not even get your meaning purely because you're adding emotion into it suddenly it's so difficult to speak to people right and you got to say to someone you know what I can't speak to you right now cuz I'm emotional I need to calm down a little bit or you say to them you need to calm down a little bit before we talk about this because anything I say because of your emotions you're going to misinterpret it right and you're going to not get what I mean right so amazingly two words emotion is added and actually can change the meaning so and it's like you know if a preacher if he attaches to little emotions then he's boring right and then if he adds too much of emotion then you lose the point of what he's saying yes when you go out there oh powerful service brother oh it was just amazing what did he say uh what did he start what scripture you start with oh no but it was powerful because he added more emotions into it than actual substance and so what did you come out with what what were you coded in with when you came out of the service that was full of emotions you can barely remember it's it's it hasn't even changed your life it just changed your thinking for a little moment while you were Anointed with something every inflection of the word every connotation every facial expression can affect how words are interpreted by you so I've always felt that the reason why I started with that introduction I've always felt that we're missing something when it comes to the word of God because the logos is the word amen am amen why it has to be the word the logos is the word right in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in the beginning was the logos the logos was with God and the logos was God that's why he said the logos your logos is the god of your being yes sir and we want to make that real to you this morning so no matter how much we quote John 1:1 we seem to be missing something we we enjoy it we say Amen to it we believe it but it's just like something like slightly out of our reach right then we read that scripture that says by the foolishness of preaching God chooses to save the souls what does it mean by save brother bam said save is SoDo in the Greek which means healing God by the listen you're not a child of hell you you realize you your your Gene seed in your heart was before the found foundation of the world it was in him that means when it came into you you were never going to hell in the first place even though death was attached to you right so you're not saved from hell you're being healed by the word by the foolishness of preaching so what you're coming here for every day every time you come to church is healing we're constantly being healed you understand what it means by when he spoke to the woman and said she shall be healed in childbearing saved in childbearing because at that time the death rate among women at child birth was terrible it was like both mother and baby could die or mother could die and baby would survive or so on right but if they stayed steadfast to the Lord they would be healed in childbearing they would be saved in childbearing of course that scripture can be applied spiritually too I know you're good at that we know that save means heal it means the word that we believe has the power to heal us from something and let's not live under any illusion when we grow up from a child you are being diseased you are being diseased by the country you live in the city you live in the race you were born into the culture you are born into the family you live with the education you receive the place where you work you are being diseased every day there is only one salvation and it's the word of God and it's going to take the foolishness of preaching to do so glory to God that's why God instituted the foolishness of preaching do you find it do you not find it odd that preaching changes Hearts teaching of the word changes Hearts I know some of you some of you wives can say you know I try to get my husband to change for like 20 years and then he comes into the service and right vice versa husband I try to get my wife I try to get my child CH you've been trying you've been working programs you've been reading the books called the strong willed child God help us and you've been you labor for 10 years and then there comes a preaching of the word and Bam life changed because it heals the word heals the word changes heart heart it changes nature glory to God literally gives people a change of heart in the same way preaching that has deception can draw man's Hearts away from truth and when preaching draws man's heart away from truth it puts in it a disease that comes from The Fifth Dimension because that's what deceptive word is yeah it's from The Fifth Dimension it's a it's word that diseases the soul it's word that brings in demonology it what it's word that brings in unbelief doubt any human being that lives with doubt and fear in their soul is someone who always looking over his back someone who's always nervous someone who's always misinterpreting everything anybody says someone who's always Moody someone who can never be happy even about a colorful birthday present it's like you give them a birthday present thinking oh now I have to buy something for them just can't appreciate the moment right somebody would some of you know what I'm talking about amen words in history so it's not a mystery to us that in the Bible God had to give 10 commandments to change the nature of man God used words 10 commandments and asked them to keep my word words abide in my words keep repeating my words come into the Tabernacle three times a year and hear my words make sure every boy has frontlets on his right hand and upon his forehead and take out those parchments and read the words God instituted that the Commandments in written word form to help transform them from degenerate Society into Holiness am words you know I I did this one series over December it was a fun series for our youth and the title of it was why couldn't God just dot dot dot and I said ask the questions and and of course the first question was why couldn't God just not have created the devil and of course we went through they just had fun with it and it was fantastic and but but this is it why couldn't God just wave a wand and and heal us but he insists on using Word yeah just for our understanding magic wands oh no I'd rather have the word there's far more uh enjoyment in the word there's far more satisfaction in the word there's far more appreciation for God's nature in the word amen I don't need to see Miracles I need more of his word so I can become that Miracle god let's go to Psalm 19 just to show you because we've speaking about the Ten Commandments the words of The Commandments the levitical law and the words of Deuteronomy actually brought peace among them and made them better humans you know I I feel like I got to stop here before we read that scripture and just tell you the world before the levitical law was diseased by tribalism All Humans created tribes in fact whatever surname you have here as you're sitting here today originates from a tribe and you're once part of a clan if you're Anglo-Saxon or european descent you come from a clan if you're from Africa you come from a clan or a tribe and and it's um there is no such thing as racism that racism is a lie of politics it's what is really called tribalism right racism there if you don't like uh a person uh it's because you're a human with preference it's not racism racism is when you legislate something against another race yeah right that's racism that's deliberately using the law to put down someone that we did have in a part but most people just don't like things about other people I don't like my own race when they don't smell nice you know if they eat weird things or that doesn't mean I'm racist towards him it doesn't matter who I mean if I get in elevator and a guy is smelling of sweat that he worked in I'm not uncomfortable you know and it's not racism it's simply human to be that way if I don't like the way someone talks someone if I grow up in a family and someone talks really loud shouting all the time you'll see it in my face I get grumpy instantly and and yet and if someone is is is a person who just talks and laughs while he talks me personally I've struggled to keep up with him he's such a jovial character I'm so happy for him but you know what calm down a bit so I can understand what you're saying that isn't racism it's just being human each one of us likes different things and the thing about tribalism is we choose our tribes based on our survival we TR choose our tribes based on convenience to protect a certain way of life so what what a lot of Christians don't appreciate about the levitical law is that for the first time it created a condition where 12 different tribes lived in Perfect Harmony that never existed in a history of mankind because tribes were always trying to take Land from the other one because of food resources water rights all that they were always fighting I mean look what even happened here in America you literally had towns with a street and Catholics and one side and Protestants on the other those were two tribes of people and then other Europeans moved in and then there was issues with the Irish and the swedes and the Italians and they all have their tribes it wasn't racism it was tribalism and they had no word to bring peace among them yeah the word of the levitical order taught them about marriages about food about uh producing about taxes about religion the levitical law was the first wisdom of the world that brought peace amongst tribes by the way this is why Babylon took Israel this is why Greece took Israel why mid Persians took Israel they wanted the law the law of Moses redid their constitutions whenever they like when they took the bab the Babylonians took the Hebrew Boys in they were watching the law and they made Daniel one of their advisers eventually he became the chief advisor why because of the law of Moses there was never a constitution that existed in history that brought peace among people like the law of God that's why it's of so such value and then when Christianity came in because people obviously look at that Roman Empire destroying everything building everything up when Christianity came in it redid Constitution can can you really fathom that the simple word of this Hebrew from Israel which was pre over just 3 and 1 half years transform the Roman Empire you know what the if you study the Roman Empire and see what it was to transform it to Peaceful Republic was impossible Caesar Julius Caesar stood there in his Senate and half of his lazy senators were sitting there all we were interested in was money and lands and Corruption and he stood there thinking these guys are definitely going to turn against me they don't care about anything they con ution was all wrong but once Christianity came and stretched to the Western World It produced peaceful democracies it was the word of God of course they perverted it but without Christianity we' be we still be fighting those bloodthirsty Wars this is the truth the law of God brought peace among tribalism so the words of the Commandment the levitical law and the words of Deuteronomy brought peace among them and made better humans why does it have to be the word so let's read I Love This David saying the law of the Lord is perfect watch converting the soul the law of God changes your nature because your soul is the nature of the spirit converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure that sure means trustworthy yeah solid amen making wise the simple that means those of us who not educated didn't even know much in life just by hearing the word of God it makes you wise it fills you with wisdom we're talking brother Chad this morning and I said you know you can take a carpenter who has that much knowledge of wood and and his and his uh whatever tools he possesses but he's got that much wisdom and it makes him a brilliant Carpenter but you can have a guy comes out of college with that much knowledge and that much wisdom and is useless right making wise the simple because wisdom was there before knowledge was there wisdom put everything together right the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart can you see the positive effects of words upon the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure that means it's single it's not corrupt it's not mixed it's pure enlightening the eyes I don't even need to preach on that because it's self-explanatory so David the king years later gives honor to the word knowing that it was by the word that order was brought into his kingdom he knew that that's why he gives honor to the word right while all other countries around them were struggling in their tribalism and mass and idolatry they just could never get it right Kings rise up Kings kill the other one then they got to kill each other's children to prevent that lineage can you imagine all the kingdoms around Israel that were just falling and rising and falling and Rising they were boted with veneral disease they were just um each one had his own Temple uh each Clan had their goddess their Temple their priesthood goddess Temple priesthood God Temple priesthood then the one said our God is the father of all your Gods so we have the most important this is what was going on for generations and they looked upon Israel and there are these people just flourishing under this law growing one Faith one Lord one law amen and all coming to Shiloh to bring the atonement uh one priesthood all United in one word and this country was growing and was becoming a threat to the whole world every time they grew someone had to come and take them over I mean come on why does Alexander the Great have to come and take over the small piece of of land it's so small yeah his it's going to take them over just 12 tribes in Perfect Harmony because they had word sought after the word think about this for 4,000 years Saints and this is the important thing there were no books for society the first mass-produced book was the Bible there were no books for 4,000 years people couldn't read there were no books yet the importance of words seemed to be being built up to a place they were being built up to hear the word he was say come to the Tabernacle the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly and it shall be uh a time where the word is spoken so all imagine church for the Hebrews they no preachers do you realize this generation right now has been is the generation in God's economy that has the most teachers and preachers in a history of the Bible Moses was not a pre preacher he had to read the same law over and over and at the Sabbath all they had to do was read the law Moses didn't even say well what the law really means is this and can you type that with that he just every Sabbath they would just read the same thing and those people can you imagine those people sitting there never reading they can't read they talk by Grunts and groans and a few words here and there and now they're hearing this word this law being spoken and is changing their hearts Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Deuteronomy is being read telling them what to do how to how to handle the rent for the house upon a wall how to handle mold in your house what where did this come from when it turns this way it looks leprous the priest must burn down the place and break this out and they had no knowledge of all these things and the law was putting something into them that was bringing them cleanliness Holiness Healthy Living Word did all that amen no one else was going to convince them you know if the people saw mold growing in the damn corner of the house they thought demons what are we going to do do you know what you know why uh um in in European culture when you sneeze they say bless you yeah because they thought your spirit leaves and the devil catches it so you got to say bless you so as a spirit comes back because they believe spirit is the wind Ru in the Hebrew when you sneeze the the the spirit comes out so you have to say bless you gazuntite kti be well in the German and the Dutch and the Africans because uh you got to bless the person when they why why do they why do they say bless you because they didn't know what the flu was so they meet someone who had who had a flu virus and they they just realize if you come in contact with someone it jumps to you they thought it's demons they had no knowledge of viruses or anything God kept them away from all that with words you shall not touch any unclean thing if it's decayed you will you will quarantine yourself for 7 days without the camp wash everything with running water if there's mold in your house what does mold do produce respiratory disease if it turns this color or that color this is what the priest must do this is how you handle your marriages Where were humans going to get that it had to come from God who understood all Natures it transformed Natures it gave them intelligence beyond all human existence amen the Messiah It Was preparing them so this this uh group of people having heard the word It Was preparing them to hear the word of the Messiah who is going to come 4,000 years later 2,000 years later and then the Messiah comes and the Lord Jesus says my words that I speak unto you are spirit and life amen amen and we quote that every denomination quotes that but do we really appreciate what that means let's read thinking man's filter and I want to show you this brother B says down through the spirit then she can pull into her soul things that isn't of God and against his word if that's a taste in the soul it it can come through the taste see it can come through the think through the reason reing there's no harm in it I have taste I have feelings I have a feeling that this is all right she can come right on down through there and right into a soul and if a soul is of that type shows that she isn't drawing through God's filter the simple thing I want to show you there is that words become more complex and the more books were printed the Bible was being printed the law was being printed the more people started a were were being able to to read uh the written word began to change things why because written word can be misinterpreted this is the issue we have with word today and brother B is saying when you have something in your soul and you're drawing through that this is how people can can bring out things that isn't of God things that is against God when you're receiving word inside that is not of God you are going to bring things out of you that's not of God it's going to affect your nature it's going to affect your behavior it's going to affect your interpretation your thinking your emotions yeah that's why it's got to be word amen that must be restored to us amen written word was going to cause the problem of misinterpretation I mean if if if you got to say something to someone and they tell you what are you trying to say do you know what happens when you email someone to say I'm sorry or explain why you said what you said how well does that go for you or Whatsapp someone to make an apology or to or to explain something when they read and they let their wife read and someone else read you now get three different interpretations and what are they trying to say he thought he's making things right written word is just worse it made everything worse when the Bible was mass-produced we then developed 3,000 different Christian denominations a word should always have been delivered by Spoken Word it probably was a bad idea for the gospel to be printed but it is what it is amen so it caused all the problems we have in the message and Christianity Today then you wonder why do we make such a big deal about the opened book what does that mean what does opened book mean this is not a book that was closed and it's opened what do we say when we say the opened book when we say open book what makes it opened right it's because it is accompanied by the person who is that word and that's why when the book is opened and you receive the opened book you there's no way of misinterpreting because he is the revealer of his word right once you receive it and that's the code you receive for your being right you cannot receive doubt or unbelief with an open book amen and it comes in with transforming power beyond written word the open book makes the written word real glory to God so why do we make a such a big deal about Revelation because people who have taken written word and corrupted their souls by misinterpretation require Revelation to change that amen we are so that's why spoken word had to come in the end time we are so because only spoken word is going to give you the right revelation of the written word right and therefore you have the enemy who's not going to waste his chance he's going to come and use spoken word to destroy that that's right to make the written word even worse than that amen so we are so particular about words that we insist on understanding histories history the atmology of words where words derived from the Hebrew part of it the Greek part of it you know how uh it was formed what's the real meaning behind it why do we do this why can't we just live life amen why can we just make up our mind about this and why do we because a human attaches the greatest value to words right you may not think so but you do it every day every day you realize as a preacher you you come here and you and you call to pray let's say you call to open the Service in prayer right there your mind is going to a a a turmoil of what to say you might in one because we're humanistic you're thinking I want to pray to please God but I also don't want to use words to offend and I also want I might want to use words to impress I might want to use words to make the worship better I I might want to shout a little bit I might want to say things quiet a little bit I might want to say all that going in Split seconds just to say a few words amen and who's going to call a brother who comes here and prays Lord Jesus bless the service heal everybody amen church can say don't call him again and yet there's nothing wrong with what he said so you are constantly at war with your own Spirit every time you speak your mind is moving A Thousand Miles a minute if it was such a thing every time you say something to someone it's the thoughts are flowing and you're trying to get the best out of what you say to get the best reaction to get the best result for yourself Lord who that's why we're so particular about words and we insist on understanding histories of the words and of the prophets of the past so do you can you sense now why the second coming of the Lord to bring full Redemption has to be the word amen amen amen there was a holy ghost dispensation the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given to Ephesus to the Ephesian Church age because they were infants in the word you say infants yes all they remember when Paul and and Peter and all of them came out there were no message books there were no Bibles the church had no Bibles I mean those guys must have had the easiest time preaching they could say something and no one was checking quotes to correct them right and Paul preached 25 hours one guy died and they Ro Rose him up and preached again those people were so hungry but if they had their Bibles they' be sitting this guyy is taking a bit too long we know this already you know we checked and and then he says he says things he's not saying it right you know because they had access to if they had access to written word they were going to be correcting the preacher but people were so hungry they were coming to listen because every word of wisdom was so beautiful to the human spirit amen do you know those of you from European descent when your Lords and Ladies when they were dressed up in all their fineries and have a handsome man coming in the street with his impressive handlebar mustache and all goatey and if he says to his to the lady Thou Art Fair like the Dew upon the grass and she faints it's like give me a man with poetry it became a thing that men could speak poetry to us now poetry is like so feminine a guy who speaks poetry is weird but back then the ladies were fainting because a man could speak with eloquent Words which is why they would stand in the street and say good morning ma'am you look lovely today today try that with a woman you look lovely today what's the matter with you weird person but that's how it was because men had to have access to beautiful words to woo the heart of a female and females realized they wanted men with words because they attach value to the words now here's the problem we're having with with um with word today in the message and in the church Christians today are Desiring signs wonders and experiences so we want to tell you we want to show you experience versus word because they feel like experience creates a bigger impact and let's prove it to you right so you can have a great experience that has great impact on your life maybe a healing maybe some prophecy maybe something that happened maybe you were a witness of something right and then later someone can come and totally remove the the effect of your experience by telling you something something proving to you that experience is absolutely nothing you know you see a you see something you see a miracle or let's say this somebody spoke in tongues and a prophecy came for you and somebody interpreted that prophecy and it's a message for you and you're now so concerned you know and this actual experience you were in the service you fell the weight of the Holy Ghost you fell convicted in your heart you uh you think I really have to solve it I really have to work on my life do something and then someone comes and tells you you know we actually know that person there's something wrong in their life that's it experience gone words all that you felt in the service all that you thought the prophecy meant you disappears because words were told you to discredit a person experience is nothing it experience only uh uh Works to confirm something that was already given to you by word not the other way around right personal experience can serve well to solidify your understanding if that understanding is backed by a particular experience related to something God has revealed to you not the other way around s why because whatever people are told or whatever they hear whatever spoken word they receive spoken word is the Original Seed amen not written word right spoken word is the most powerful it changes nature and they tend to live by it and believe it words can make them even deny an experience you know it's like if you ever been to a courtroom and uh there's a witness who saw an accident and uh he knows he says I saw what happened this guy went through a red light he turned right he was not even using his his uh his indicators we call it in South Africa I know what you call it here flickers what is it turn signal oh that's so long turn signal we call it indicators our word sounds better so anyway he didn't even use his turn signal and he just went through and I saw that he was moving at at a great speed and the and the the the prosecutor or the defendant's lawyer comes to you and says so where exactly were you or I was standing over there uh were there any people in your way uh wasn't there a crowd according to the cameras we saw there was a crowd around you um and uh are you a mathematician uh do you know about acceleration do you know how could you tell what speed he was traveling at I'm a driver for 20 years I should know no you don't suddenly his experience and his witness starts changing because the the defendant's lawyer is putting doubt in his mind about what he saw and what he knows by the way what color was the car uh it seemed like like a it seemed like a like a steel gr it seemed like are you sure that's what lawyers do and then uh he turned right and and if he turned right and there were people in front of you how do you know he wasn't using his turn signal you know because there were people walking across this intersection and and how did you know they will put words in your mind that makes you deny what you even saw and you'll up believing it and then you walk away you came up there to the witness stand like this I'm ready for you you walk out like what just happened right and this is what happens when people come to church and you feel strong in a conviction about something you witness you come ready to testify and the Deacon tells you you know what I don't think it's a good day for you to do that and then you downcast you come into the service a powerful message and you feel like oh they denied me this you missed the whole thing just because of someone's words removes an entire experience words can make them even deny their experience the mystery of it Saints is words are the most powerful because when they are believed they are so powerful as as when they are rejected when a person believes what they've been told it inscribes a particular nature into that Soul which you will live by thereafter it drives your mind to think in a a certain way to interpret life in a certain way to interpret reality in a certain way that nature produces a new set of characteristics it can produce anger sadness uh irritation agitation whatever kind of nature just the words that were imprinted inscribed into your soul but think of what happens when that same word is rejected it produces a different character in The Soul resulting in different characteristics and a different path of life than believing and accepting rejecting a new character same word so this is what I want to bring to you all right let's go to what it really does word brings meaning we want to break this down even further so when you consider words as letter form some would say it's not all that powerful because you know what people who you there's people who use sign language right so it's not really letter I was speaking to our brother who was able to sign the other night and we were talking about that and I I mentioned that as well so what words so word is beyond even letter and even speech because word can even be signed right right you can use sign language for people who can't hear or speak and still word is transferred to a person and it can change in nature yeah yeah right so if word can transcend even what is written or what is spoken it moves us into other dimensions of word so we consider that the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was God and that was before Earthly languages was formed true amen the word himself like I said the other night did God say let there be light in English no not even Hebrew none of that was formed the Catholics had no right to turn Latin into the holy language because God never even spoke Latin just stop and think about it for a second the Word was God what does that mean to you so word is not just speech it's not just writing the word was God the word is God and it began as a thought and when it was expressed it BEC speech and then when speech is believed it becomes manifested amen amen so it began as a thought amen so what word really is so why does word become manifested why do you every single one of you listen to the word and then it becomes manifested why would a human do that what is a human seeking me meaning of life every human here and outside in the world wherever you are every person who's under depression every person whose mind is going insane every person who's having a birthday party right now every person who's trying to work right now and earn a living every single human is searching for meaning in life amen and they're looking for it everywhere those who have gone into alcoholism have given up trying to find meaning those who are to drugs have given up on trying to find meaning they didn't even find it or something that was given to them removed all meaning from life for them and they are living in a hopeless state but all humans are looking for meaning more than anything unlike other creatures humans want meaning in life they seem to want to to know everything they want to have meaning what does this mean what does this mean what do you mean right I wonder what that means a sign in the heaven what does that mean or the solar eclipse or the moon the red moon or this happening everything is meaning what does this mean what does that mean what does this mean and Christians who grow up under prophecy they're the worst ones everything means something brother Al I had a dream last night a black snake was chasing me what does that mean it means you're afraid of snakes that's what it means no could it be an evil spirit no you're afraid of snakes you have some anxiet in your life and it's expressing itself in your dream don't spiritualize it do you want it to be a prophecy of something is that going to give you more meaning but you're searching for meaning so every single dream becomes something Supernatural I tell our people just remember if you dream you can receive messages from both sides amen It Whatever dream if it doesn't tie up with the word don't form something out of it that's right search for meaning that's what they want all whole lifelong answers to question why how when how those of you who have Todd us that why why because I said so why it never ends you're just waiting Lord I'm waiting for this wise stage to go away just can't handle it anymore so the mystery in what word really is is meaning amen are you with us if you talk to a child and make a statement to them and you expect them to comply children are the best what do you mean what do you mean this actually will show you how good you are at communicating what you mean just talk to a child total five and seven that's the best age they're going to make you teach something in Simplicity you're going to have to dumb yourself down you're going to have to remove all your harsh words you're going to remove all your simple your your uh your your difficult language you're going to have to make it so simple you even have to get down to eye level eye to eye because you know the these Toddlers and and little ones they're always when you talk to them they're like like everything's shaking all over the place and they moving I'm talking to you you'll literally have to hold their face you want to get their meaning across to them because if you don't they're going to tell you what do you mean I didn't know what you mean I'm sorry I did that it's not my fault it's your fault you didn't tell me what you meant right from a child sayings what do you mean it simply means you need to express your thoughts a little better to create better understanding because until their child finds meaning in what you say it's they're not going to comply with you so more than likely if you're getting a rebellious child first check how much meaning you're giving them right you want them to have a certain Behavior you feel just telling them is good enough but I told you not to do that but why I want to I want to do it why should you not want to do it see that children are so beautiful in that they'll make you confront uh something to the finest detail of reality they don't just want to be told don't do that cuz I said so because even you don't do that when your pastor says so because you want meaning how how do I know that I must comply with that and and now as adults upon whose authority because that's a thing does that give you more meaning of what has been said if it's if it's spoken by someone more respectable even the simplest person can tell you something with meaning and if you value meaning you'll listen to it it doesn't even have to be a pastor or Deacon or a preacher that person's spoken word with reality behind it can give you meaning but here we are respector of persons because someone is more popular or someone is a higher degree then we take what and when you do that you are not receiving something with meaning amen every human is looking for meaning that's what the word really is that's the difference between the word that is confusing word of the educated word of man that comes from the word of God that's the difference the word of God carries real meaning amen that's why it has to be the word yes sir when did meaning lose its importance to humans right because that's what's happening today right I mean look at how they're changing language literally changing language today you can't even speak the truth this woke language is actually sleep language it's not woke it's not a they're saying they woke up it looks like they're they're tranquilized yeah they don't even know what reality is yeah right people can so easily choose to follow something that has absolutely no meaning brother Chad and I were discussing he didn't even know I was going to talk about this but we were talking about the lack of respect among people and the way we um you know the the the way uh teenagers are talking the way public is talking there was a time where we we we strove for good speech now we like cutting things everywhere words are cut in half you know there's there's they're communicating over social media someone sends you a meme what is a meme half the time when I get send things I've going to say back what does this mean I don't know what you saying am I supposed to laugh at this or how am I supposed to respond I don't know you know and and this is what's happening today language is just being obliterated it's like it's like so perverted you you can't even talk like them anymore right more and more people don't care for meaning anymore and that's where I believe the lack of interest in the word of God in Messi's churches is coming from because they're not seeking for meaning they think they've got something and when they thought they had it they didn't accept the open book they didn't that's what the Lord said about David that's what the prophet said they thought they had the word that's why they didn't receive it what they attached a certain meaning to something just because brothers so and so started a Doctrine they attached meaning to that they thought this works for us let's form our tribe our camp around that and let's persecute all other camps and then it never works because it doesn't have real meaning then it produces a certain kind of character and a certain path of life and eventually the church breaks down people backslide because they're taking things without the real meaning which is why it must take the word here in the end time the enemy was so poisoned the soul of man that he has lost that desire for meaning and feels temporarily satisfied living without meaning you ever see people walking around aimlessly you know life not knowing what to do not having a clue what to do our our grandparents were already married by 16 had jobs building houses you know and today children are struggling to find meaning in life because we're creating systems that's dictating something to them removing the original meaning of life and you're educating them this meaning is being imprinted into them by the words they receive yeah right it reveals meaning the Bible has the answers with meaning for relationships amen amen the Bible is the greatest source of meaningful life young people I cannot tell you what a a great asset it is to know your scripture yes sir amen and we were we were fellowshipping this morning over breakfast about Ecclesiastes and and and the things that we're learning a simple thing like Solomon says don't be over Wicked and don't be over righteous that means it's like if you're going to be Wicked just a little bit don't be over Wicked then I got to understand that I thought you know what I really like coffee but I shouldn't indulge that's the wisdom in there it's wicked it's my pleasure but I shouldn't have too much cuz it's not healthy right and at the same time don't be over righteous he even says don't be over wise if you only know the value and the meaning that your scriptures have you'll hang on every word you got you got meaning for every aspect of your life in the scriptures and then to top that off we got a message on top of it glory to God and it didn't just leave us to then the very person of the written word comes down glory to God it gives us meaning for every part of our every day you could give your soul the answers it desires for every the Bible has the answers with meaning for relationships to governing the world from relationships to governing the world for handling of society in the best way for health that's right it reveals meaning for raising children so it feels like rejection of the word of God has brought about rejection of meaning in life so when you reject the word of God the revealed word today you are rejecting the meaning of life for today this is why you'll constantly have an unending thirst because there's no answer in your soul for the question for meaning so it feels like rejection of the word is just what's causing it today and yet you don't need to be a Christian to desire meaning do you know what a soul is soul is the question who is God the soul comes from God that's the answer every human soul wants who is God where do they chase they chase looking for God they don't know what they're asking they don't know what their soul is asking they think it's ambition they think it's entertainment but this all the soul wants to know is who is God that's it's one single question and just that question either can have faith in it or doubt in it amen this is why a person who filled his his soul with the desire for smoking when he got the qu the answer who is God the smoking was God Amen right y if you don't f it with meaning you have problems do you know that this is the reason people always seem to reach out to religion even if you're a person who doesn't believe in God atheism is your religion yeah it's true I once told an atheist dadd he got so upset with me I I said to him you have faith he said no faith is blind I said yeah you have faith he said what do you mean I said you have faith that atheism is right you believe it I said do you believe that there is no God he said yes I said well so long as you believe you have faith he lost his mind I said and you have a following of atheists and you have books written that there is no God so you just have a Bible too and then you all get together on social media and you communicate and have church yes right so there's no difference everything you're accusing me of you are yes man he lost his mind you can be from the australias from the Amazon you could be a Native American you and you search for meaning yeah right you you look to the Stars you gaze at the mountains you stare across the Horizon of the ocean you uh you stand there at the ocean when it's crashed the waves are crashing against the sand your brain ignites in different reasons if you had to put color to it it'll just it's flourishing with color you're standing there in front of the ocean and your eyes start misting up because you're taken by the beauty of something you can't help it your soul wants meaning and moments Flash before your eyes and simple things like a little song starts to bring memories from a time that you stored as a treasure in your soul you can't help it you're searching for meaning parts of your brain start to get excited that don't normally get excited when you're looking at a blank page or a computer screen right when you're standing out there alone with someone whom you love your eyes get Misty your skin has goosebumps your life seems to flash before you you recall memories that you made you establish meaning in your past in your present you're trying to make sure there's meaning in your future and unexplained emotions come over your wife or somebody ask you what what's the matter I don't know I just don't want to talk about it now I'm going through something and then the cell phone rings boom moment's gone so this is what I believe is happening today in the world saint as long as you have people constantly distracted you're going to stop having moments that require meaning that's what you got to face the fact that's what's happening today as long as you can be the enemy wants to keep you distracted you're going to not search for meaning how is it going to keep you from reading the word he's going to make sure you're under pressure at work he's going to make sure you're checking all those emails you're checking all all those those messages or checking up with someone you're going to have so many distractions and prioritize everything else and you don't realize it's that simple 10 years go by and suddenly your relationship with your wife has gone cold come on now because you were not chasing meaning you are being distracted from chasing meaning every day and then suddenly your child backslides and you thought what happened then you realized I was too busy with work to pay attention to them or something else happened and I didn't do enough to bring meaning to their life I should have been there uh every time they had something or I should have been there for them and then it's living with regret because during every of your life you're not following meaning so this is what I believe is happening today as long as you have people distracted moments of meaning are disappearing if the enemy keeps that going for 10 years of your life after 10 years you suddenly have a moment and you realize the last 10 years of your life had had no meaning and suddenly you're filled with regret Believers carry meaning am amen this is why I believe believers who carry the word are so important to society we carry meaning for the soul the Christian Church put aside meaning 1,500 years ago when they chose to disregard the holy ghost in the church and they kicked it out then when the Renaissance period arrived you know the all the painting 16 Chapel industrialization great painters great musicians composers suddenly this what were they looking for trying to bring meaning into life more color into life right and they became a subject the educated called logic and reasoning they felt that if something was logical it would give meaning to the soul they decided that if something had good reason to do something had good reason then it carried meaning and would satisfy logic and reasoning is not bad because it provides meaning for things if you see things that occur around you but not for the question why did the universe come into being or why should I marry this girl and why do I feel like she will Satisfy My Soul and why do I feel committed to her when I barely know her and yet why do I feel like I cannot live without her constant question logic and what are you looking for logic and reasoning you're going to check with a friend check with Mom check with Dad check with this check with that why are you so unsure because you you've been programmed to use logic and reasoning to make decisions that started with the Renaissance period mathematics science all that and that's the reason when people don't find meaning soon enough they reach out for substances addicts they become dissatisfied with relationships with that girl they fell in love with after school they made promises to at the altar they had children they used to love one another they suddenly become dissatisfied with life in general because they let reasoning and logic getting away so meaning extends to revelation how does one know when you have meaning it's like when you have found what we call your soulmate this thing people have right soulmate what does that even mean what you have found is what you're saying is you found meaning in a relationship we got to break this down to find a detail it's not just a friendship you can use for a better life with someone oh I I I want to marry her cuz I need someone to wash my clothes or I need someone to cook my food or I need someone to talk to or I need to marry that person because she's very quiet she can listen to me talk right it's always selfish motives that you you do to satisfy yourself how somehow you know when you met your soulmate you found something more that you didn't even know you needed but something inside clicks there's a meaning that takes place beyond logic and reasoning you bring her home and your mom say says look what the Cat Dragged In hopefully Believers don't say that but there's going to be every single thing and it's going to be like what what are you even thinking do you know what family they come from you know amongst the Indians is are they even educated do they have a degree are they poor are you in your right mind because those things bring meaning in life right if you want to marry an Indian you've got to have a degree and you got to have money cuz that's meaning apparently so when you have found someone that you feel you love and you are promising to spend your life with them and when you make those vows at the altar you're giving over a part of your soul to them yes why must we speak vows and why are vows so important and why are they kept what happens when you speak a vow at the altar it's not just God listening to it and we must keep them because no you are inscribing something into the other one's Soul by your words you are giving over a part of your soul to them and what must have happened is that you have settled something inside you that believes that you found meaning in this person's life that's going to add meaning to your life amen you're excited to see the meaning you believe you are going to receive in the days after when you're living together people will doubt your choice in her and even question you but you seem so sure you've never been so sure of anything like this before what you have experienced is something powerful related to word and it's called Revelation that's why people will disagree with you because you have a revelation you have something inside that says this is the person there is nobody else people are going to ask you how do you know you're making a mistake shouldn't you be thinking again no youve have you have meaning inside and no no argument is going to remove that you have you know this is why when a hard time comes you'll stick together when the worst time be it death be it Peril be it Sword whatever it is you'll stick together because meaning is what's holding it amen you have a revelation that allowed you to see meaning some Beyond time and space that allowed you to make a decision that seems all wrong for every reason that others point out to you so let's break it down quickly before we move to the next step what you what are you actually saying when you love her when you say I love him what do you actually mean what is love what are you saying it's a word what is it caring is it an emotion is love mean at Valentine you must buy red hearts and teddy bears and chocolate what is it what do you mean by you love her what does it mean when you're in love with someone it's a lot less romantic when you know what it actually means it means you believe in them amen yes if you love your wife you believe in her and she believes in you that's what love is can you live you can only live with someone who you believe believe in because if you believe in them there is trust there is no jealousy there is no enmity there's you believe in them that's what it actually is amen belief what do you believe about them you believe in their way of life you believe in their emotions you you believe in their thinking you believe in their speech you believe in their essence you believe in their personality you actually believe they'll make you a better person it that's what love actually is love that word that full letter word nobody seems to know what it is it means believing in someone I love you brother I believe in you I love you sister I Believe In You am amen there are um here we go pergan Church AG now we can see this association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word in his name am I at the right place it doesn't look like I'm at the right place um I'm looking for my pergan church age 162 yeah this is it uh now we can see his association with the word he is the word that is who he is the word in his name in John 1:1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos now watch which means the thought or concept the concept of God huh double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus beautiful so when I believe the word when I love him amen I believe in him that's not just saying I agree with his concept no I believe in his concept means my soul is attached to his concept my soul is so attached it's like linked it's like Stitch together that's what it means when I believe the [Music] word the word comes in four forms thought spoken word written word manifested word amen so once it's thought it's spoken and this is the magic of it right when it's spoken it cannot return void and this is the problem when you lie it's going to produce something yeah right right it's not ever going to do nothing yeah if you say anything deceptive it's going to produce something if you say something positive it's going to produce something because that's the sequence thought speech or if it's written mean it's recorded and then it's manifested right the logos of God became the spoken word then became the written word in the Bible and then the manifested word in his people the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he the very Concept in the thought of God's mind whatever that is manifested spoken you know this this's one place brother R said he speaking about Genesis 1 God spoke the word spoke the word Genesis 1 and then he for form Med everything am before anything was formed he made man and man wasn't even formed then he formed him out of the Dust of the ground he's so it becomes spoken word and then it becomes manifested word that's right glory to God so within time written word and spoken word are supposed to transfer the original concept right right right the original thought the thoughts of the hearers of the word so the final manifestation would be exactly according to the original thought that's what we need amen so if you're sitting and listening to the message and the message is not bringing the life of the original thought right there's something wrong with the word you're receiving and that's why it's going to produce a character upon the church that shouldn't [Music] be that's how it works this is why we needed the original word to return in the end time glory to God the meaning of life that it brings is unparalleled amen problem lies in between spoken word and manifested word there's this terrible thing written word which everybody misinterprets that's the problem right unbelief was encouraged by the written word being misinterpreted so that every time spoken word is given logic and reason tells you to compare it to the written word what does it mean by check it up with the word how do you interpret that yeah when you when you hear your pastor preach do you check it up with the revealed word or the written word when check it up with the word when your pastor preaches do you check it up with the logos himself or the written word amen because if you are triggered by reasoning first you will go straight to the written word to try and disprove it the the question you need to ask yourself is why are you doing that yeah are you searching for meaning or to correct something always check the motive because if you really want to know the meaning check with the logos himself amen praise be to God unbelief was encouraged by the written word I'm not saying listen I'm one of those people who loves the written word I'm going to check it every single day if I have to right but my motive is to love him more my motive is to believe more Not To Doubt more that's right amen amen because I love him and I know love means to believe him I want to read what I want to believe and now if I'm going to check something which I didn't understand I want to check it with the motive of believing am because I love him so then spoken word which is the original see it takes its place in the mind as perceived word brother said the word the mind is the womb of the soul the spoken word comes to you it germinates it drops into it's the womb of the Soul it germinates and drops into the soul and then you believe it amen right that's the reason Revelation or of the or the revealed word is crucial if you don't have the correct revelation of the spoken word you will manifest Christianity according to man's idea sec in Corinthians Paul says it's impossible for a man to understand the things of God if he has the spirit of man you cannot understand the things of God unless you have the spirit of God is that right that's where the Holy Ghost comes in I always use this uh this analogy I'm not sure if I mention it here but it's like it's like this you have man and you have a chimpanzee and they both look alike right somewhat a little bit more ha and he's not wearing clothes right but he has he can walk around he's got five fingers he's got five toes he's got a head he's got eyes facing forward his nose like ours his ears and you can put a suit on him you can put a tie on him you can teach him how to drink from a cup you can give as long as you keep giving him peanuts he'll do exactly what you what you want him to do you just keep giving him snacks and he's going to keep he will wear the suit for more peanuts yeah right right right yeah but does he know why he's wearing a suit the suit has no meaning to him yeah he actually hates it he doesn't know how why should he can you imagine a chimpanzee lip on a cup how difficult that must be and and what's he going to do with the tie it's choking him to put his feet in a shoe he's not going to climb a tree yeah you're removing the meaning from him by trying to put human things on him right there's only one way you can get this chimpanzee to think like a human yes sir you have to become a chimpanzee you have to go down to his level you have to explain so what what happens if you become a chimpanzee and you walk in the tribe and say we need to build a house we can be better let's become civilized let's stop biting each other's faces off you know let's share the berries this is we can become better people we can become you have to become a chimpanzee it's funny but this is what God did for us that's right but the church wants peanut nuts blessings I'll be a Christian as long as he heals me I'll be this as long as he blesses me but are you finding meaning or you just want peanuts but he became man he showed us how to be better he brought his the concept of God into flesh the word was made flesh for you and I he died for you and I and he could show us that we don't have to be this immoral human race we can and be Godlike he brought that down to us I don't want peanuts I want his word I want the meaning praise be to God the Holy Ghost was not sent to give you power of Miracles and speaking in tongues and prophecies so we could boast in spiritual power it is the nature of God only given as a gift to eventually lead you to meaning that's that is to believe the word Saints there is a famine of revealed word today do you see why people play so much value in what you say and that they that you can accept or you can condemn with your words take a few lessons from the scripture what did they say to Jesus Christ not for the Miracles and works but because you say that's right amen his words yeah right when he said who do men say that I am now he's challenging their word yeah what meaning do you have oh some say this some say that what do you say he amen and when it was said that was the Christ the son of the Living God Flesh and Blood had not revealed this to you they got meaning which was not revealed by Flesh and Blood why was it so important at Revelation when Jesus third pool Ministry came in when everyone left Jesus the 70 turned away he turns to the disciple and says will you leave me too what did they say whom can we turn to for you have the Miracles of eternal life that's right you have the signs of eternal life you have the word you have the meaning you have the answer for my soul amen who can we turn to all of the reasons to give why that be why so concerned with words they didn't say because you do great Miracles the the the 70 were going out and doing the Miracles and turned away right and when they heard the word they stumbled at it because it wasn't the meaning they were looking for where they secretly studying the philosophers to be to be philosophers why did the group of 11 unimportant uneducated men of all different stations of life care about words because they heard him speak and his words brought meaning to their soul amen his name is called the word of God when Jesus said my words that I speak unto you are spirit and life this meant that the word of God is like a seed that carries power to germinate a character amen that gives you a path of life amen that means he was saying that words carried in power to them to transform Souls by changing their Natures to deny previous desires and lusts and to give them new desires amen so the more word you believe the more character you receive the more character you receive the more word you believe until you can believe in fullness and if you believe in fullness you receive the full character thank you so here's why this is crucial to us because belief is attached to words it's so hard to comprehend and admit that our belief is based on Words Right the foolishness of preaching yeah our belief is based on Words you know someone can love you with the actions where they can cook for you every day they can wash your clothes clean your clothes clean your house they can uh play good music in your home they can make a nice atmosphere and all of those things they can do everything for you but their words to you can Crush you belief is attached to words belief affects the soul and changes the nature then when you truly believe something you cannot help acting on it because believing in something gives you Faith to act why is the word so important to true believers they know the transforming power of the word they know the danger of false word amen they know that word without that Revelation is immediately misinterpreted into perceptions that alters the nature of people to create Strange Behaviors am that is not in accordance with the nature of the Holy Spirit that's why Believers know and distrust false word they know the word without Revelation is immediately misinterpreted a True Believer knows the warning that in the last days people will not be able to endure sound doctrine that they will accept wed down weak words to suit their lives of pleasure I had a wonderful Minister friend who said to me he said brother I think people today are looking for a convenient God and I thought wow that's it they want a convenient God they and he said this they want a God to agree with them A True Believer knows that warning amen a Believer knows his responsibility to share the true word that will change people's lives for the better we're almost closing a True Believer knows he cannot force a person to believe but he can adjust himself so that people see his life and might believe you know as preachers we can use our Charisma to convince you but if we are trying if we convince you someone can convince you better we have the responsibility to know when we deliver the word it must be pure not with my character behind it not with Charisma behind it not with anything else that's wooing a person it must be purely delivered from God himself if it's any other way they're going to be convinced out of it by someone with a more convincing argument because naturally you are logical reasoners and the enemy knows that right A True Believer knows the important of feed importance of feeding his soul on incorruptible word from the pulpit a True Believer knows that his soul cannot be satisfied with half truths or tainted doctrines of man the word as we call it the open book meaning the thoughts of God in the form of the revealed word sent to bring us in the last days unto Mount Zion the spirits of just men made perfect that's what the word does Amen let's close this down I've got one last thing to talk to you about the end which shouldn't take long but just look at this the Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee if you want to know the Bible is telling you why the word has to come into the heart the word protects me from sin Psalm 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path what does that mean it gives me direction for Life John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify them means separate them consecrate them give them purpose through Thy word because it's truth these are just three of hundreds that's right of scriptures this is the prayer of Jesus in in Gethsemane sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth amen sanctify make holy the truth shall set you free Saints Traditions are formed from the anxiety of logic and reasoning yes right do you know that yeah because leaders in the message leaders in the gospel leaders in the past they formed Traditions to control the church to to keep a religion because they were anxious that they were going to lose people or that they thought even if they were thinking good they were thinking that that we don't want the faith to die we need to be strong on these traditions we need to keep this we need to police this and you failed because the moment you start doing that you're not allowing a person to find real meaning [Music] amen so a real five-fold ministry will not be doing that to people be delivering the truth with absolute Revelation amen Proverbs 13:13 says who despiseth the word shall be destroyed thus sayeth the Lord shall be destroyed this is not a commandment this is not a suggestion this is not advice this is a statement if you despise the word sent for your day you shall be destroyed you might as well have not heard it than to have heard it and despised it but he that fearth the Commandment shall be rewarded you'll find meaning glory to God rejecting the word is you destroying your own life amen you you remember your soul is longing for meaning as a Believer as a bride of Christ you're only going to find happiness and to be complete if you meaning for your day and it lies in the open book amen now taking all that we have said this morning Saints well it's now afternoon ask yourself what a serious lack of word in a believer's life causes for him or her ask yourself what consequences are about to come upon this world that is living without meaning Can you feel it happening they're losing their mind they're heading for war it's like they're not even rational it's even logic and reasoning is failing them that's what I mean the the the whole aspect of meaning is gone they don't even know what life is they don't even know what marriage is they don't even know what bringing up they're advising young women not to have children which species does that this is the worst state of man we've ever seen this is why a Son of God is satisfied with the word this is why saints Saints of God die with peace and no regrets amen this is why those who get the word sleep easier are happier handle stress better they are not struggling to find meaning meaning is all around us and they bring meaning to everyone else they meet what can a worldly what meaning can a worldly neighbor bring to you but us them what you mean to them you know it right kinsman redeemer and this story was written in all the old manuscripts when they were segregating the Bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together in the Old Testament This Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why if it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning and it'll bring you close to God glory to God you cast the real meaning it brings you close to God if there is lack of the word there is lack of meaning if there is lack of meaning the soul of man is no contentment the worst thing is to see a human living with no contentment if there's no contentment a man's Soul dies a really slow painful death eating away at his Spirit his mind becomes diseased his mind one not one spiritual fiber at a time until there's nothing left to save and the man who was once is unrecognizable right what he was once he's now unrecognizable yeah so in closing I want to just leave you with this thought simple thought your logos is your God Amen your logos your logos is the god of your being it's what your temple worships in reality I'll ask you the question who is your god who is God to you you can't you can't imagine the father you you can't imagine the spirit of God you can't see the Holy Spirit you don't know Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago you have nothing tangible to attach belief to the only thing you have is your logos the word of your being that is who you pray to that is who you worship that is who you submit to your logos is your god that's how a human was made if everything we spoke to you about that you know now that words have meaning people only bow down to meaning people only submit to meaning who God is to you is your logos amen this is why it has to be the word yeah amen the logos of your being is the reality of God to you because it rules your being that's why it had to be the word and the word only could bring let's read John 1 1 to 3 or 1: 4 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with god listen to this and I want to prove this to you all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made what is it saying to us the logos is your god whatever you hold in your heart in your mind your logos your word is going to create everything in your life everything you put in your life is caused by you your logos your reaction your words your feelings your emotions it rules you and you once lived with a corrupted logos yeah in him was life and the life was the light of man applyed to yourself personally and you'll see why people live in darkness because their logos is Darkness amen have you noticed and this is this is where we're closing have you noticed how the L do you do you are you even awake spiritually do you know know what information overload is do you know what's happening on the Internet it's for the first time humans are having an information overload their minds are filling with the logos that is not the word of God who are they listening to their souls are searching for meaning they're listening to Dr Jordan Peterson they're listening to all the philosophers on YouTube they listen imagine the these desperate souls are searching and there's nothing Mr Dr Jordan Peterson is probably a good speaker a good philosopher trying to understand the very mysteries of Life he's probably more well balanced than all our politicians he's probably more well balanced than other philosophers that we had in the past Socrates and arist I don't know then there's other people but young people are flocking to these men who are speaking word and they're getting meaning of life from them they're reading their books they're watching their videos on YouTube they're listening to their podcast why are people so desperate this is happening all around you at a time where the logos himself has descended with an open book and there are people around you desperate people searching for a logos to give their life a good path good meaning good marriages they're looking for Logos to recode what a man is because they've been hammered with toxic masculinity feminism man must wear pink shirts and man must dress more feminized man must do this man must do this and now those men are rushing to this philosopher on the on YouTube to find out what can I be to change what they're telling me millions of people are taking their those men's word as logos I can't tell you how tragic that is when I watch this and what we have it makes me want to go go out and tell them I have something for you people of the world are make now for your family if you're young people if you're spending if you're imagine a scale if you're spending this much time on the internet and this much time on the word of God and you're just depending on Sunday morning service this is your logos right amen because this is where you are taking me meaning of life from and now check what happens with every family if your logos is built on education television music podcast news I I mean just look at your country America they designed it to control you you have presidential elections every four years midterm elections every four years do the people ever get a break they got you in a constant cycle of division and hate yeah yes what do you think the logos of your country is what do you think the mindset of your people are are they stable do you ever think they'll be stable if they're constantly pitted against each other one party against another party they wanted that way because they're getting rich by it how can you have people voting every four years and in between that every two years yeah midterm elections Senate votes house votes Congress presidential the people don't get a break you can barely get used to one president and there's another one and each one comes with another logos and then they legislate that logos and then they must police that logos yeah right what's happening to society is breaking your education system down you don't trust schools anymore and the last time I came here one brother tells me it's so difficult to be a teacher in America because they're forcing you to teach certain things to the children how does that form a society it's so politically divided I don't even want to tell you about our country I mean but but America was supposed to be the Bastion of democracy the example to the world the Improvement of the of the Roman system instead now it's a laughing stock they don't even know where they stand with Israel men should not have their logos being given by other men whether it's Dr Jordan Peterson whoever is on on on the on the on YouTube man should not be giving logos to other men it has to be God himself because true meaning only comes from him the god of your being is your logos what is your logos that controls you what is it that your spirit bows down to what is the only thing that tells you when someone is telling you the truth how do you ever how are you ever going to navigate what your wife is telling you if you're falling in love with someone how are you ever going to know that you're doing the right thing if you're operating by man's logos you're lost you're heading for disaster the god of your being is your logos what is your logos that controls you what are you without the word whatever your logos is you draw from it when you speak it manifests in you and cements it into your substance and you become what you speak that is how word Works logos spoken word manifested word you know this very well a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things Matthew 12:36 but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment Matthew 12:37 by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned where are you bringing words from your logos and the word a man is not corrupted by what he takes in butes out what comes out because when you speak it you know what when you when you have a thought and he working it over you're reasoning it out you're not going to act on it until you speak it that's right because once you speak it it becomes manifested it's ingrained in your substance it becomes who you are people are going to hold you try that but you said 10 years ago I remember you said that don't deny it if you denyed you're lying then you forced to say oh but I said this because that you must understand the conditions under which I said that no no you said it it became your substance you believed it you acted upon it you treated me this way because of what you said you can say sorry if you want to but 10 years when why and you believed it and you acted on it and you treated me that way because people are not going to forget what you say Amen by the words that you speak you shall be justified and the words you speak you shall be condemned because whatever you speak becomes you that's why I need the word today amen that's why it takes the word I'm not looking for signs and wonders I'm not looking for experiences I'm not looking for anything else I I believe in him I love him I believe he came down for that very reason to bring meaning to my life I believe he can make my marriage better I believe he can make me a better person I believe if I keep his logos in my home my children my wife will all have a better uh understanding of Life we'll all share the same thing you know it's so simple you can see a a household where there's just the the father of the house is just a joker practical joke what do you think the kids are going to be like because that's he's made that the logos of his house if he's an authoritarian he he runs his house by rules well what do you think the kids are going to be like whatever your logos is is what you become this is why you need the word only church if the word cannot change you nothing can only the word can give true meaning to life make the open book open book The go of your being and watch the change of your character take place amen he will move from your thoughts to your speech to your substance amen we we were just talking uh about the there's so many things we were talking about and the brothers didn't even know what I was speaking on but I'm thankful to have been able to share this with you it's something that I hold very very close to me I want to know this is the reason why I want to speak right I want to I want want to speak well I want to say the right thing I want to say it with the right inflection I want to say it with the right motive I want to speak it with truth because I know whatever I speak becomes me and I want what I speak to be influenced by the revelation of God for this day that's why it's got to be the word amen the Lord bless you let's bow our heads together and call Brother Chad the musicians let us pray Heavenly Father wonderful s savior We Worship You from within our souls Lord it is true you have brought true meaning to our lives Lord maybe we have we have not realized the value of the word the value of the revelation of your word maybe we have not uh understood what what value there is maybe we we needed to understand by the behaviors that the prophet speaks about throughout the message maybe we needed to to see these things Lord because we we come to church sometimes we think it's just a tradition sometimes we think we're just come because we have to because we're message Believers because we're Christian but Lord I pray that you would make it a real understanding in the heart of every person that when they come they prepare to receive the logos of God the concept of God because we believe that in our soul nothing else is more important to us father we believe in your way of life we believe in your your thoughts being our thoughts we believe in our words being influenced by your thoughts because we know our words will become our substance Lord I pray for these your people your children who are here seated in this place Lord once again it is the foolishness of preaching but you promis that it would be that that would bring healing to us Lord if anything father may we realize how important the coming of the Lord the opening of The Seven seal the open book coming down in the hands of the Angel the reason for eating the book oh Lord if that just could become a reality to every person every young person not just some fictional or fantasy religious idea but an actual reality because words affect us I pray that it may be indelible in the hearts of your children printed Lord that they may know and realize every moment every time we read a devotion every time we read a scripture every time we read a message every time we listen to a a recording or a message of the Prophet it is logos coming into me the logos the Lover of My Soul Lord the one I believe in with all of my heart I pray Lord that this would be so for every one of us here today bless us father forgive us Lord if we ever disvalued it if we ever search for other things other than your word may we be be may we find Focus may we come back we don't want to live lives of regret Lord at the same time if we have wasted our life it isn't too late Lord we know we are willing to change we're willing to learn we're willing to progress we are willing to go all the way with you Lord forgive us have mercy give us Grace help us to continue give us more of your word Lord for you have the words of eternal life we have no one else to turn to in this world there's no philosophers there's no books there's nothing else everything we need is in your word and that's where our fellowship is that's where our our Revival is that's where our anchor holds glory to God lord we love you with all our hearts may you come upon us this day and Inspire our hearts once again rejuvenate us Lord if we have been lying dormant for too long set a purpose to our feet Lord put a song in our heart put a testimony on our lips put a smile on every face we ask it now in the L in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen Amen brother

mouth of God oh hallelu Hallelujah ask it shall be given unto you seek and we shall find knock and it shall be open unto you oh hallelujah hallelu amen we we knew the value of the word but now I think we're learning more and more the value of what God has given us I wrote down one line here at the end something brother Benham said said are we sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst I think that's our goal is to be sufficiently impressed with what God has given us what God has given us is changing us what God has given us was sent to bring us into his very image so that we can reflect the very thought of God he gave his word so it would reproduce the word in flesh God help us help us to consecrate ourselves help us to surrender ourselves help us to focus on what he's given us this whole world is set up to distract us from that Focus God help me to resist the distraction and stay focused on what he has given us and be sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst how many of you want to be changed into the image of the word amen then it's going to take absorption of the word to be changed into the image of the word may God help us I don't know about you but I I was blessed I was challenged I was corrected amen and I was lifted up am I was encouraged to move forward I was given instruction amen all the things that that Paul told Timothy the word would do I received it today may God have his way with each one of us I hope you like me will leave these meetings better than when I came having a clearer focus more determination a clearer vision and asking God to change me into the image of his word yeah one thing I realized is the true word will bring the true life amen the false word will bring a false life because the word will reproduce itself God give us revelation of your true word amen men God is good I just want to say we love you all and we're so thankful for each one who've been here those who've gathered in those Among Us that normally Fellowship here we love you may God bless you may the blessings of his word become a reality in your life day by day and let's just bow our heads together and thank God dear Lord Jesus we thank you for God you're so good Lord to bring Clarity greater understanding vision and direction to us Lord God we believe Lord that your rod and your staff they comfort me what your word leads me your word corrects me Lord and I want to surrender Lord to that leadership for God I cannot lead myself and I cannot allow allow the words of other men to lead me and I I I don't want the false perceptions Lord that are coming from all around me to be my leadership but I want the true revelation of your true restored word I want that to be my leadership Lord I want your spirit to make The Word Alive inside of me Lord I want to receive it in the purity of the word by divine revelation and I want it to become Lord the action in my life help me God help me God to separate my self from everything else that's not your word and be holy devoted to you alone Lord God forgive me for what I speak forgive me for what I've said Lord help my words to come and be a match to the word that I've received amen God change us into your very image mold us into your very likeness as we receive you Lord God this word came in this generation for a purpose and that was the purpose was for you to be manifest in a many membered bride God you're going to accomplish that purpose because you said you would and you're going to do it by the word that was restored God we want to surrender to that once again and say be it unto me according to your word we love you Lord we thank you for bringing us here we thank you God for what you've done in our generation now may we go Lord having heard let it not be trivial to us or or superficial to where it just hits Us in the intellect while we're here but it fades away as we step into the fer Lord may this be a change in US Lord may it bring to us a greater depth a greater life a greater reality in what you have given us may we be changed Lord by the word that was spoken here today God May the reality come into manifestation L we ask that you would bless our brother Alistair Lord that you would strengthen him and renew his strength and give him greater Revelation than he's ever received before and use him Lord in this world for the purpose you've raised him up for May you bless him as he travels on here in the United States to other places may you use him there as well and when he goes home may go home Lord refreshed amen revived Lord because youve poured back into him all that he poured out and may each one of us Lord Find meaning in the true revelation of your word and may that meaning come into an expression and fulfill the purpose by which you brought us here for God that's what matters more to us than anything is the reason we're here in this generation hearing this word so that we can become you in this generation we love you God we surrender to you we ask that you carry us as we part Lord after such a wonderful time in Fellowship we part and go different ways some will travel back to their homes and some will extend Fellowship but then there'll come a Monday and a Tuesday Lord where we have to go and live what we have heard we have to go and manifest as we wake up in the morning and we eat our breakfast and we go to work everything that we've experienced and heard has to manifest in a life in this day help us Lord to receive you and you only we love you God bless us as we go and may we be God what you've intended for us to be be we love you and we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you God bless you as you go may the blessings of the word become reality in you and
