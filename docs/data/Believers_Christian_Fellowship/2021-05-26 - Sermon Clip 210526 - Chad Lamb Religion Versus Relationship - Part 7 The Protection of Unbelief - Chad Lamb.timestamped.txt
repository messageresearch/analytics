[0:00] that's why ahab threw macaya into the
[0:03] inner chamber and to the south
[0:04] because macaya by speaking the truth
[0:07] amen he become a threat to the false
[0:09] union of ahab and jehoshaphat
[0:13] and all he did was tell them the truth
[0:15] and they asked him to
[0:18] they called him they asked him
[0:21] and he tried to let him off the hook he
[0:23] said go up
[0:26] go on up he knew they wouldn't receive
[0:29] it he said
[0:30] you just go on and he said haven't i
[0:32] told you before just tell me what the
[0:34] lord says
[0:37] he told him exactly what the lord said
[0:41] ahab knew that was the word of the lord
[0:43] but because it threatened this new false
[0:45] unity
[0:47] that became between jehoshaphat and ahab
[0:49] he threw him into the inner chamber
[0:51] why because the truth was a threat to
[0:54] the religious system
[0:59] you see why the devil once the devil
[1:03] would want
[1:03] people who are associated with this
[1:05] message to take the message and make it
[1:07] a religion
[1:08] because if they do they'll be willing to
[1:09] protect their religion
[1:12] because the religion becomes the
[1:15] security
[1:16] and they will be willing to compromise
[1:19] amen they will be willing
[1:20] amen to give in to keep
[1:24] what is my security
[1:28] but if your security comes from your
[1:30] personal relationship with jesus christ
[1:32] and your identification by this word it
[1:34] doesn't matter what they do to the
[1:35] church it doesn't matter if they scatter
[1:37] us as believers
[1:37] it doesn't matter they throw me in the
[1:39] inner hall they cannot separate me from
[1:41] the love of god that is in christ jesus
[1:43] because it's been revealed to me
[1:44] personally
[1:46] shut the doors to the church will not
[1:48] stop anything
[1:51] amen but the devil would like to take
[1:53] religion and have us have a false
[1:55] security
[1:55] so that we have a need to protect our
[1:58] false security
[2:00] amen if you're security in christ
[2:04] and nobody believes what you're saying
[2:06] it's okay
[2:08] nobody believed mikaya he was fine with
[2:10] that nobody believed
[2:11] jeremiah he was fine with that nobody
[2:13] believed isaiah he was fine with that
[2:18] because their security did not come from
[2:21] the system their security came from god
[2:23] himself
[2:26] that's why religion is a barrier to god
[2:28] amen it doesn't bring you to god it's
[2:30] not the upholder of truth it's the
[2:32] protector of unbelievers
[2:34] it's the sheltering amen of the
[2:37] unbelievers
