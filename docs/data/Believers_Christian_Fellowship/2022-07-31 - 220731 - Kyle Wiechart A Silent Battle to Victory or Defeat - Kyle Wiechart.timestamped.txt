[12:16] day you've ordained it lord you've
[12:18] ordained you've guided my mind you've
[12:20] anointed me in such a way but lord
[12:22] ultimately lord i don't know how to help
[12:24] your people but i believe you're here i
[12:26] believe lord you'd promise wherever two
[12:28] or three are gathered in my name there
[12:30] i'll be in the midst and lord you choose
[12:32] unlikely unworthy insufficient vessels
[12:35] to speak your word so father god i'm
[12:37] trusting in that now speak to all of us
[12:39] lord strengthen us this day lord may we
[12:42] say that it was good to walk with you

[12:46] commit ourselves to you in jesus name
[12:49] amen
[12:50] amen god bless you all
[12:52] musicians thank you
[12:55] good to see you all today
[12:57] i'd like to have you turn in your bibles
[12:59] to isaiah
[13:01] 14.
[13:02] forgive me it has been a little bit
[13:03] since i've been up here so it's like i
[13:06] gotta get a rhythm here so i apologize
[13:08] i'm so used to speaking at my own home
[13:10] in the comfort of right in front of my
[13:12] own fireplace and talk to the youth and
[13:14] so it's just a little bit more
[13:16] intimidating here in this spot
[13:19] it's always an honor and a privilege and
[13:21] also scary as i'll get out to know that
[13:23] i have to come
[13:24] and it's not so much
[13:26] what scares me always is am i going to
[13:28] be saying the thing that you'd want me
[13:29] to say lord that's what always scares me
[13:31] because i just want to be able to find
[13:32] his will find his mind
[13:34] i don't certainly want to establish my
[13:36] thoughts in your lives i want the word
[13:38] of god established in your lives and
[13:42] and before i begin i just wanted to say
[13:43] also i've been really blessed by the
[13:45] minister that have been able to come
[13:46] through it was a while since we've had
[13:48] that many ministers back to back to back
[13:50] and
[13:51] it was a real honor and a real privilege
[13:53] to be able to see them follow the
[13:55] leadership of the lord and just speak to
[13:56] our hearts speak to our needs and also
[13:58] to see the leadership of the lord and
[14:00] brother chad as he's been ministering i
[14:03] believe to all of us in such a special
[14:05] way and he certainly has been to me as
[14:08] well and i really honored brother to
[14:10] have you as a brother and as a friend
[14:12] and as my pastor
[14:14] and how many appreciate him as your
[14:15] pastor okay there you go brother chad
[14:17] next time the devil says nobody loves
[14:19] you what was that how many people love
[14:20] brother chad
[14:22] okay record that brother franco sent it
[14:26] so it's an honor
[14:29] so i am have a thought it's been in my
[14:31] mind for a little while i had just
[14:33] ministered it this last week to the
[14:35] youth
[14:36] and then
[14:37] brother chad asked me wednesday night
[14:39] and i began to scramble looking for
[14:41] another thought i'm like it's okay to
[14:42] bring that to the youth but how do i
[14:44] bring it to you all you know
[14:46] but it's like anything else if he
[14:48] doesn't let you go anywhere then you
[14:49] better just say what he wants you to say
[14:51] if you will turn in your bibles to
[14:52] isaiah 14
[14:54] chapter 14 verse 12.
[15:00] isaiah chapter 14 verse 12.
[15:07] let us begin how art thou fallen from
[15:09] heaven o lucifer son of the morning how
[15:12] art thou cut down to the ground which
[15:14] did weakest the nations
[15:16] for thou has said in thine heart
[15:19] i want to bring attention to that
[15:21] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[15:24] ascend unto heaven i will exalt my
[15:26] throne above the stars of god and i will
[15:29] sit upon the mount of the congregation
[15:31] and the sides of the north i will ascend
[15:33] above the heights of the clouds and i
[15:36] will be like the most high
[15:39] turn now to ezekiel 28.
[15:50] ezekiel 28
[15:51] 14.
[15:58] say amen when you're there
[16:02] thou art the anointed cherub that
[16:03] covereth and i have set thee so
[16:06] thou wast upon the holy mountain of god
[16:09] thou hast walked up and down in the
[16:10] midst of the stones of fire
[16:13] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[16:15] day that thou wast created till iniquity
[16:18] was found in thee
[16:20] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[16:22] have filled thee with in the midst of
[16:24] thee with violence and thou has sinned
[16:27] therefore i will cast thee as profane
[16:29] out of the mountain of god and i will
[16:31] destroy the oak covering cherub from the
[16:33] midst of the stones of fire
[16:35] thine heart was lifted up because of
[16:38] thine beauty
[16:39] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[16:42] of thy brightness
[16:43] i will cast thee to the ground and i
[16:46] will lay thee before kings that they may
[16:48] behold thee
[16:50] just ask prayer one more time
[16:53] lord
[16:54] take the word take the vessel take both
[16:57] speaker in here lord and minister unto
[16:59] yourself lord we love you we thank you
[17:01] we commit ourselves to you now in jesus
[17:03] name amen you may be seated
[17:08] um
[17:10] i'd like to read another scripture verse
[17:12] for you let's find my comfort zone
[17:15] second corinthians chapters 10 verse 3
[17:17] says
[17:18] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[17:20] not war after the flesh
[17:22] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[17:24] carnal but they are mighty through god
[17:26] to the pulling down of strongholds
[17:29] casting down imaginations and every high
[17:32] thing that exalteth itself against the
[17:35] knowledge of god and bringing into
[17:37] captivity every thought into the
[17:40] obedience of christ
[17:43] we are at war everyone
[17:45] congratulations
[17:47] welcome
[17:48] uh boot camp is over
[17:52] and now you're fighting the greatest
[17:53] battle that's ever been fought
[17:55] and there's not a one of us that isn't
[17:57] fighting the battle you know brother
[17:59] brian if you came in today with a black
[18:01] eye and a bloody lip and uh ripped up
[18:03] shirt we'd say that brother had a rough
[18:05] time getting here this morning
[18:07] and we wouldn't believe it was sister
[18:08] anna never we would believe this brother
[18:10] really got into quite a battle on the
[18:12] way here
[18:13] and that's obvious because we all could
[18:15] see that we could all know that
[18:17] but many times that's not the battle
[18:19] we're fighting in this day that's not
[18:21] where the battle is raging that's not
[18:23] the difficulty that's not the problem we
[18:25] are living in satan's eden and the
[18:26] devil's been studying this and he's been
[18:28] bringing up his tactics he's been
[18:30] studying humankind he's been studying
[18:32] you since you were born he knows the
[18:34] weak spots of your life and he's going
[18:36] to hit you each and every time in that
[18:38] weak spot the devil is a powerful being
[18:42] i have never liked and i do not think
[18:43] it's right to ever minimize him as a
[18:46] powerful foe he is not some pushover it
[18:49] would not speak to god's glory to make
[18:51] an enemy that wasn't a worthy opponent
[18:54] we have a worthy opponent
[18:56] that's why in the bible he says michael
[18:58] not bringing a railing accusation
[19:00] against him he just said the lord rebuke
[19:02] you and so today i'm not bringing a
[19:04] railing accusation against this worthy
[19:06] opponent i'm just saying by the word of
[19:08] god and the authority of god we rebuke
[19:09] you in the name of jesus christ you have
[19:12] given us a shield and a sword to combat
[19:14] you we're not looking at the strength of
[19:16] our arms we're looking at what god has
[19:17] equipped us with to fight this great
[19:20] battle
[19:21] and this title that came to my mind this
[19:23] is just a sentence that came to my mind
[19:25] a few weeks ago and it was the silent
[19:27] battle to victory or defeat
[19:30] a silent battle to victory or defeat
[19:35] and i want to take some time if that's
[19:37] okay i i'm not one that usually has a
[19:39] lot of notes you all know me enough by
[19:41] now but by the time i got done i had 10
[19:43] pages and um
[19:45] and i
[19:46] i was a little surprised so
[19:48] and
[19:49] yeah so so i have some things i want to
[19:52] say and i'm going to lay some background
[19:54] i'm going to lay some foundation
[19:56] and i'm going to give some examples if
[19:58] that's okay
[20:00] just like if uh if we could see so many
[20:03] times we could see that um you know
[20:04] someone that's sick uh brother uh
[20:07] brother juan right god blessed you and
[20:09] he raised you brought you up out of the
[20:10] hospital for the glory of god and we can
[20:12] see that we can recognize that we can be
[20:13] in prayer for our brother because we can
[20:15] see the ailment we can go to a physical
[20:17] hospital and we can and we can pray for
[20:19] the brother but how often do we
[20:20] recognize the spiritual wounds and the
[20:22] heartache and the breakness in a spirit
[20:25] realm of an individual how often do we
[20:27] recognize that we don't know it because
[20:28] we can't see it but it's as real as ever
[20:31] and that's where the battles are really
[20:32] won and that's where the battles are
[20:34] really lost
[20:36] in the mind
[20:37] it's in your mind you know these things
[20:40] but oftentimes we stand here as if oh it
[20:42] doesn't matter it's not a big deal oh it
[20:43] matters
[20:44] and it's a big big deal you think the
[20:47] devil is going to just all of a sudden
[20:49] come to you one day and just oh just
[20:50] deny the message deny the word no he
[20:52] don't work that way he's too slick he's
[20:55] really slick he's really smart he knows
[20:58] exactly how to just keep throwing out a
[20:59] word here and there throwing out a word
[21:01] see if you're going to grab it capture
[21:02] it take a hold of it and cast it away or
[21:04] if you're just going to meditate on it
[21:06] just a little bit just begin to consider
[21:08] it oh my that isn't a bad thought you
[21:10] know that's how he caught captured eve
[21:12] he was there with eve and he just you
[21:14] know gained a buddy buddy with him you
[21:16] know talk to him a little bit became
[21:18] friends with her and before long he just
[21:19] you know just threw out a little word
[21:21] and just a slight perversion to it to
[21:22] see what she would do instead of quickly
[21:25] turning and say no that's not what god
[21:26] said i'm going back to my husband adam
[21:28] she began to entertain that thought a
[21:30] little too long and that thought began
[21:32] to take root in her mind and brother
[21:33] branham said she didn't commit natural
[21:36] dog treats she committed spiritual
[21:37] adultery when she forsook the word of
[21:40] god and she listened to a perverted word
[21:41] of the devil she opened up the womb of
[21:43] her mind and brought forth a perversion
[21:47] there's where the battle started there's
[21:48] where the battle was lost
[21:50] it wasn't lost in the physical act it
[21:52] was lost in the mind
[21:54] she opened up the womb of her mind and
[21:56] there she lost the victory and that's
[21:59] where you lose your victory that's where
[22:00] i lose my victory that's where the devil
[22:02] attacks us he begins to sow those little
[22:04] seeds of compromise those little seeds
[22:06] of perversion to the word of god and the
[22:08] promise of god to this hour
[22:10] he said he'd be for me he said i'll
[22:11] never leave you nor forsake it you
[22:13] believe that
[22:14] you say well i believe he'll never leave
[22:15] them or he'll never believe those but
[22:17] how will he leave me i don't know maybe
[22:19] he will no no no that's not reading your
[22:22] name into it that doesn't sound like a
[22:23] rock that you're standing on it sounds
[22:25] like a rock that somebody else is
[22:26] standing on that's told you about what
[22:27] they're standing on but it doesn't sound
[22:29] like the rock you're standing on
[22:31] he gave me a place that i can stand so
[22:33] i'd like to take some some time
[22:36] and let's look at this
[22:37] second corinthians 11 2.
[22:41] so you know paul became very concerned
[22:43] very nervous about that subtle enemy he
[22:46] said for i am jealous over you with a
[22:47] godly jealousy for i have espoused you
[22:50] to one husband the
[22:52] word then i may present you as a chaste
[22:56] virgin
[22:58] this is what he was trying to do with
[23:00] eve this is what he was trying to do
[23:01] with the early church but he found she
[23:03] became perverted the devil got to her
[23:05] first but god is watching over a people
[23:08] she's not going to be perverted she's
[23:10] going to keep herself in a virgin state
[23:12] only to the word and to the word only
[23:15] he says i fear lest by the means of the
[23:17] serpent beguiled eve through his
[23:18] substility except through his subtility
[23:21] so your minds
[23:23] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[23:26] that is christ
[23:28] you see the devil's so slick he's so sly
[23:31] he's working angles and you don't even
[23:33] realize it every day of every hour he's
[23:37] watching you
[23:38] seeing if you're standing on the word
[23:40] right or if you're compromising by
[23:42] reasoning affections
[23:44] memories
[23:46] bringing back the old memories of things
[23:48] that are contrary to the word of god
[23:49] what are you going to do with it
[23:51] you're going to take a hold of it
[23:53] you're going to cast it aside
[23:55] affections for the things of this world
[23:57] what do you do with it
[23:58] contrary to the word and will of god for
[24:00] your life what do you do with it
[24:02] do you entertain it do you let it take
[24:05] root in the womb of your mind because i
[24:07] promise you the battle is won and lost
[24:10] there
[24:11] it's always won and lost there i can
[24:12] show it to you in almost every type in
[24:14] the bible the battle is lost right there
[24:19] first peter 5 says be sober be vigilant
[24:22] the adversary the devil goeth about as a
[24:24] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[24:27] with one objective kill you
[24:30] spiritually kill you if he can do it
[24:33] the greatest battle ever fought we know
[24:34] that the original sin was not in the
[24:35] garden of eden original sin started in
[24:37] heaven
[24:39] lucifer got lifted up in his own beauty
[24:41] and in his heart he never said it out
[24:43] loud in his heart he said i will ascend
[24:46] i will do this i will do that i'm going
[24:48] to leave my position that god has placed
[24:50] me because i will i'm a little better
[24:51] than that i can do a little more than
[24:53] that i can be in a better position i can
[24:55] do i could i could do it better than god
[24:57] could do it
[24:59] uh-oh
[25:00] you think you can do something better
[25:01] than the way god has done it
[25:04] no sir let's bring it home a little bit
[25:06] do you think god has set things in order
[25:08] the way they ought to be
[25:10] do you think all things are working
[25:11] together for the good to them that are
[25:13] that love god
[25:14] yeah you believe you have the right
[25:15] parents god said them so you believe you
[25:17] have the right brothers and the right
[25:18] brothers and sisters sitting in the
[25:19] church with you today do you think the
[25:21] wrong ones are there
[25:23] do you think the wrong persons are in
[25:24] offices
[25:25] who are you
[25:27] are you god
[25:29] you're not god
[25:30] we know that all things are working
[25:32] together for the good of god
[25:34] don't let the devil throw a seed a
[25:35] little seed of discrepancy in your mind
[25:37] you start to say well that's off and
[25:39] that's wrong and that's wrong they
[25:40] shouldn't be here that shouldn't be
[25:41] doing this nonsense
[25:43] god hath thus said it so god has
[25:46] ordained it so god put these things the
[25:49] way they are so if you have an issue
[25:50] with that you better say lord help me to
[25:52] understand because i just don't
[25:54] understand but don't try to figure it
[25:56] out i trust you god i believe you we're
[25:58] not always supposed to figure things out
[26:00] and try to understand why people do the
[26:02] things they do we're just supposed to
[26:03] believe god and say god's going to work
[26:05] it out for the glory god knows what he's
[26:07] doing god knows what he's doing in that
[26:08] one god knows what he's doing in this
[26:10] one god even knows what he's doing in me
[26:12] how many have looked at your own life
[26:14] say lord i do not understand me
[26:17] thank you i'm not the only one there was
[26:18] about four people in here that are
[26:20] humble enough to admit you don't
[26:22] understand you i don't understand me
[26:25] i've been frustrated with me for 38
[26:28] years well i can't i was four years old
[26:30] you know what are you going to do in
[26:31] your 40s i don't like me no
[26:33] as long as i can remember i've been
[26:35] frustrated with me
[26:37] i've got weaknesses i've got complexes
[26:41] you've got them too
[26:43] we all got them
[26:45] and you need them
[26:47] little do you know you need them
[26:49] those weaknesses are going to make way
[26:52] for the strength of god to be your
[26:54] satisfying portion and your shield and
[26:56] your buckler when you need it
[26:58] ain't that something
[27:00] even your weaknesses are working out for
[27:02] the glory of god
[27:03] it's like uh you know brother ahri was
[27:05] talking about them stones right and a
[27:07] sculptor a great master sculptor he'd
[27:09] take a stone you ever i i know at the
[27:11] fair here they have that man that comes
[27:13] with the chainsaw you've probably all
[27:14] seen him and he he'll shape a
[27:16] piece of wood and make like an owl or an
[27:18] eagle or a wolf or and he just shapes it
[27:20] away but not every single block of wood
[27:23] that he chooses is the same some of them
[27:25] have big old knots on the side here and
[27:27] one have a limb out here and they say
[27:28] well what's the purpose in that you know
[27:30] why they should all be just exactly the
[27:32] same you know god don't make cookie
[27:33] cutter christians we're all different
[27:35] we're all stones a little bit different
[27:37] with each other but the kicker of it is
[27:39] in the mind of that sculptor he had to
[27:41] have that kick out part that part that
[27:43] kind of goes off this way it's a little
[27:44] oddball right a little bit strange he's
[27:46] like tilted this way but in the mind of
[27:49] the the carver he knows what he's got to
[27:50] do
[27:51] that has to be there so that when he
[27:53] cuts it the right way it'll bring into
[27:55] view his masterpiece
[27:56] and so are you you say i don't like this
[27:59] about me i'm i'm oblong i can't be like
[28:01] this brother this no you're exactly the
[28:03] way you have to be for the sculptor to
[28:06] bring in to view his masterpiece
[28:08] it has to be that way you have to be
[28:10] that way
[28:11] not that god's going to leave it there
[28:13] no he's going to cut it away a little
[28:14] bit he's going to shape it he's going to
[28:16] mold it and bring into view the thing he
[28:18] wanted everybody to see
[28:20] ain't that something god has a purpose
[28:22] in these things god has a
[28:24] plan in every one of your weaknesses
[28:27] it's a wonderful thing
[28:29] but also the devil knows these
[28:30] weaknesses too
[28:32] now with these weaknesses you have one
[28:33] of two things you can take the word of
[28:35] god and say i'm fearfully and
[28:36] wonderfully made god made me this way to
[28:37] serve his purpose or with that same
[28:39] weakness you can create a complex and
[28:41] say nobody wants me nobody needs me i
[28:43] can't do it i can't make it i can't do
[28:44] it and the devil begins to hit that weak
[28:46] spot
[28:47] boom boom boom boom wearing you out
[28:49] wearing you out seeing what you'll do
[28:52] the greatest battle ever fought
[28:55] this great first battle that was ever
[28:57] fought began in heaven when michael and
[28:58] his angels fought against lucifer and
[29:00] his angels it first started the first
[29:02] battle was in heaven so sin did not
[29:04] originate in earth it originated in
[29:06] heaven and when it was and then it was
[29:09] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[29:10] heaven to the earth and it fell on human
[29:12] beings
[29:14] then the battle from angels became human
[29:16] battles and satan come to destroy god's
[29:19] creation what god had created to be for
[29:22] himself
[29:23] he
[29:24] had satan come to destroy this
[29:27] that was his purpose was to destroy it
[29:30] then the battle began here on earth and
[29:32] it begins in us and it's been raging
[29:35] ever since
[29:36] so the greatest battle ever been fought
[29:38] you know this it's right here
[29:40] isn't it interesting in the building of
[29:42] the statue of a perfect man we know what
[29:43] god has been doing he established us
[29:45] upon the foundation of the apostle
[29:48] apostle paul so building up his great
[29:50] masterpiece he set it upon the feet
[29:52] right and then he raised up ireneus and
[29:54] martin and columba and they stood upon
[29:56] that foundation and the body's coming
[29:57] into view and he brought it up through
[29:58] luther and brought it out to wesley the
[30:00] great missionary age he said and then it
[30:02] came up through the restoration of the
[30:03] gifts of the holy spirit to tongues and
[30:05] then he restored a prophet so we could
[30:06] see clearly but now where is it
[30:10] where's this great battle now
[30:13] and isn't it interesting in 1963 he
[30:15] signified his coming by the head coming
[30:17] and uniting with the body
[30:19] so the body has now been formed god must
[30:22] have seen something god must have been
[30:24] doing something god must be getting
[30:26] everything set and ready for the
[30:28] greatest of great battles that has ever
[30:30] been fought to go into view
[30:33] because look at this
[30:36] he says
[30:38] when that great battle started on earth
[30:40] there had been a mutual meeting place
[30:42] there had been a place selected for this
[30:44] battle to begin and the battle to rage
[30:46] and that battleground begins in the
[30:48] human mind there is where the battle
[30:50] starts the human mind is the chosen
[30:53] place for the battle it's where it will
[30:54] begin and it's where the decisions are
[30:57] made of you see from the head okay i
[31:00] don't i must have the wrong but brother
[31:02] ban makes the comet he says now god's
[31:03] been selecting some select soldiers
[31:06] some certain type of individuals you're
[31:08] not talking about you're just everyday
[31:10] soldiers not like your everyday marine
[31:12] no navy seal like right so you like say
[31:14] i wish i wasn't in this age i wish i was
[31:16] back 200 300 years ago no no no god must
[31:19] have been watching for some select
[31:21] soldiers the elites of the elite of the
[31:23] elite you may complain about the satan's
[31:26] eden that you're in but i promise you
[31:28] you were brought up to this day and this
[31:30] hour to defeat satan's eden this is the
[31:33] age for the overcomer you're not like
[31:36] everybody else this bride is not exactly
[31:39] like everybody else she is the elite of
[31:41] the elite and brother brown said that
[31:43] greatest battle that ever has been
[31:45] fought is getting ready
[31:47] to go into array
[31:49] now hold on it struck me when i heard
[31:50] that i said now hold on i thought the
[31:52] greatest battle that's ever been
[31:53] thought's been going on for 2000 years
[31:54] well the battle the mutual battleground
[31:56] in the mind that's been going on but the
[31:59] greatest battle that was ever to be
[32:01] fought is now ready to happen
[32:04] because god has brought into view his
[32:06] masterpiece god has equipped her god has
[32:08] revealed to her his secret she has his
[32:11] word she knows what he wants done with
[32:13] it she's fully equipped she's battle
[32:16] armored sword in the hand shield in the
[32:18] other helmet of salvation she's ready
[32:23] he's been getting her ready
[32:24] so you may complain about this
[32:26] foe you may complain about this satan's
[32:29] eden but don't complain
[32:31] you were rose up in this generation to
[32:32] destroy it
[32:34] just as samson was rose up in his
[32:36] generation to defeat the you know
[32:39] the philistines
[32:40] so have you you've been rose up for the
[32:42] same thing but how was samson defeated
[32:46] who defeated samson which philistine
[32:48] army overcame samson
[32:51] no army overcame sampson
[32:54] he got defeated here
[32:57] he put the words of a woman in his
[32:59] affections for that woman over the will
[33:01] in the word of god that had prophesied
[33:03] that he was rose up to destroy these
[33:05] philistines
[33:06] and he let the word take the words of
[33:09] this woman take preeminence in his life
[33:12] and he failed and lost the battle right
[33:14] there and that's where we fail and lose
[33:16] the battle when we take any other idea
[33:18] over the word of god then the lucifer
[33:20] has found his position and has exalted
[33:22] his throne above the stars of god
[33:25] you see
[33:26] it's very interesting now brother bam
[33:28] says in satan's eden there is a god of
[33:31] this world that i have preached to you
[33:33] about last sunday here he is today in
[33:35] deceit
[33:37] in this treacherous hour that tremendous
[33:39] time that we're living that it's the
[33:42] most glorious time of all the ages
[33:44] because we are facing the great
[33:46] millennium again we're facing eden again
[33:49] but right at this age all the deceit and
[33:52] every tactic that he has ever used and
[33:55] been able to deceive with he has
[33:57] gathered it all together he has
[33:59] reinforced himself and he's come down
[34:01] like god and has put himself in the
[34:04] place of god religious and can quote the
[34:06] scripture and can tell you scriptures
[34:08] just as satan did to eve in the garden
[34:11] of eden but he'll leave out one spot of
[34:13] it that's all he has to do he just makes
[34:17] a little gap where the poison doctrine
[34:19] of the devil can be poured in like that
[34:22] you see like the thinking man's filter
[34:23] that i was talking to you about the
[34:25] other day
[34:26] oh
[34:27] so there it is
[34:29] thinking man's filter
[34:31] where is this filter
[34:33] where must it be put in its proper place
[34:35] at you know it's everything's got to run
[34:38] through the will and word of god in our
[34:39] minds
[34:40] casting down imaginations in every high
[34:42] thing that would exalted itself above
[34:44] the word and will of god for your life
[34:46] now he said he would exalt himself and
[34:49] be above the most high he would ascend
[34:51] above the clouds of the stars he would
[34:53] sit there like god and be above the most
[34:56] high he has succeeded in carrying out
[34:59] his threats he has certainly had a
[35:02] marvelous success in carrying out his
[35:04] threats
[35:05] by listen by the people letting him
[35:08] explain away
[35:10] in every age
[35:12] the value of god's promised word to that
[35:15] age
[35:16] that's exactly how he has done it in
[35:19] every age he explains it away
[35:22] my through human reasoning through human
[35:25] affections but remember everything's
[35:27] trying to get you back to the control
[35:29] tower back to the soul level where
[35:31] there's either faith or doubt in the
[35:32] word of god everything's probing
[35:34] everything's coming through the
[35:35] imagination conscience reasoning
[35:37] affections memories
[35:39] see taste feel smell in here
[35:40] everything's probing where's the weak
[35:42] spot where's the weak spot where's the
[35:43] weak spot where can i get in boom boom
[35:46] boom boom i got one
[35:48] he didn't cover this up with prayer
[35:49] he didn't deal with this he hasn't been
[35:51] able to put hold up the shield of faith
[35:53] in there and stop the fiery darts i got
[35:56] him
[35:57] boom there he got him
[35:59] so many times it's not just the physical
[36:01] things right brother one it's the
[36:03] spiritual things that are the problem
[36:05] we're not dealing with the spiritual
[36:06] gaps the spiritual sicknesses the
[36:08] spiritual wounds the spiritual scars
[36:11] haven't fully healed
[36:13] you know when there's a scar you don't
[36:14] keep it a big old bloody mess you get
[36:16] cut on something right and it's well
[36:17] walk around and play in the mud no you
[36:18] cover it up it'd be foolish to do such a
[36:21] thing
[36:22] so you better keep some things covered
[36:23] up
[36:24] you got some weak spots
[36:26] you have to keep them covered up
[36:28] you have to overcome you have to do what
[36:30] god told you to do see it's like so
[36:32] basic but you know what i'm saying is
[36:34] true and you know you haven't done that
[36:36] sometimes i know i haven't
[36:38] am i right say amen if i'm right okay
[36:41] well not me that i'm right god's word's
[36:42] right i'm not right now i'm just a
[36:44] nobody in here
[36:45] so
[36:46] we got to keep some things covered
[36:50] eve did not want to do that he showed
[36:52] her how it was more wisdom
[36:55] and and she didn't know she wanted to
[36:57] know she didn't understand but she
[36:59] wanted to understand and god told her
[37:01] not to try to understand
[37:04] how can i understand all of these things
[37:06] i cannot understand all of these things
[37:07] i believe them i don't have to
[37:09] understand them god is faith not
[37:11] understanding we just believe what he
[37:13] said okay so how many of you have not
[37:16] understood something that has taken
[37:17] place in your life that has created a
[37:19] scar or a weak spot and you tried to
[37:21] figure it out and then you got
[37:22] discouraged and dismayed and down and
[37:24] out
[37:25] brother shay's the only one i'll be with
[37:26] you brother i might okay brother okay so
[37:28] we've got a few more
[37:29] you tried to figure something out about
[37:31] your own life or the circumstances of
[37:32] your own life and the situations you
[37:34] went through why things happen when you
[37:36] were young why this happened why'd this
[37:37] have to go that way you tried to figure
[37:39] it out you're not supposed to try to
[37:41] figure out why everything is all you
[37:42] need to know is god rescued you you're
[37:44] here today you're the seed laying in the
[37:46] presence of the sun god's ripening you
[37:49] what more do you need
[37:50] don't let the devil try to explain away
[37:52] the value of the word that has been
[37:54] given in this day and this age to bring
[37:55] you to your full harvest maturity god
[37:57] isn't playing around this is a big deal
[38:00] this is not something we are taking
[38:02] lightly this message is not to be taken
[38:04] lightly this isn't just some random
[38:05] thoughts spoken by a kentucky born boy
[38:08] no this is the mind of god coming down
[38:10] and calling you as the light for this
[38:12] hour to quicken the seed to its full
[38:14] harvest maturity to bring those navy
[38:16] seals into view to fight the greatest
[38:18] battle that's ever been fought today
[38:21] and it's all happening in your mind and
[38:23] what you're doing
[38:25] what you're thinking about what you're
[38:28] uh pushing away
[38:31] are you satisfied with the word
[38:33] are you sufficiently impressed with what
[38:35] he is doing
[38:37] are you trying to figure it all out and
[38:39] say well that one shouldn't be there
[38:40] this one shouldn't be here that guy is
[38:42] not right this one's not right oh well
[38:45] if he should have done
[38:48] just say devil
[38:49] get out of here
[38:51] that's not right
[38:52] everything is working for the good
[38:58] eve and that spiritual womb
[39:01] the battle rage when eve opened up her
[39:03] mind and she began listening through her
[39:05] reasoning that was the flu that it came
[39:07] in it came in through a channel and run
[39:08] down through reasoning down to her soul
[39:11] her eyes
[39:12] her eyes of sight she saw that serpent
[39:14] he was a beautiful handsome far better
[39:16] than her husband he was the most subtle
[39:18] of all the beasts of the field and he
[39:19] was probably fairer than her husband he
[39:22] looked like a great big masculine beast
[39:24] standing out there how great he was he
[39:26] was trying to tell her all these great
[39:28] things and the first thing she did she
[39:30] opened up her mind and when she did
[39:32] human reasoning caught it
[39:34] and so first it hit satan hit eve's mind
[39:37] and in the womb there of her mind she
[39:39] doubted god's word and then come the act
[39:43] so you've never fallen into sin
[39:46] by accident
[39:47] you've never just done something wrong
[39:49] no i promise you you put aside the word
[39:51] of god first you don't just make
[39:54] mistakes you lost the battle in your
[39:56] mind and then you went out and
[39:57] manifested or brought the physical act
[39:59] into view you don't a man just doesn't
[40:01] commit adultery no he opened up the womb
[40:03] of his mind to adulterous thoughts and
[40:05] he began to commit spiritual adultery in
[40:07] his mind he had to push aside the word
[40:09] of god and then he goes out and creates
[40:10] and messes up and does the act but he
[40:13] didn't that that act wasn't the mess up
[40:16] the the the sin was here
[40:19] sin started in heaven in heavenly places
[40:21] it started up there and then it brought
[40:22] down into these earthly battles to be
[40:24] fully manifested fully expressed but it
[40:26] all started up here
[40:28] okay
[40:29] these things don't just happen
[40:32] they don't
[40:33] you've been equipped you've been you've
[40:35] been you've been taught you've been well
[40:37] trained
[40:38] and now the battle is going into array
[40:41] in the beginning of the word the word
[40:42] was with god the word was god the word
[40:44] was in the guard was and the word was
[40:46] made manifested and it dwelt among us
[40:48] and right among us the word of god the
[40:50] spoken seed from the very garden of god
[40:52] when every seed was to bring forth of
[40:54] its own kind that's right when eve got
[40:57] perverted and got to listening to the
[40:59] lie of a devil and took the wrong seed
[41:02] into her womb of her soul to believe one
[41:05] word that was twisted
[41:07] see the devil's just not going to come
[41:09] and tell you something that's just a
[41:10] million miles from the truth
[41:12] that's not deceptive that is not
[41:14] deceptive at all he's going to come it's
[41:16] going to be 90 99 right it's going to
[41:18] look really good it's going to look
[41:20] that's just about right but he'll leave
[41:21] a gap
[41:23] one little gap tell you something 99
[41:26] true with a gap
[41:27] and you inject that one little word and
[41:29] see what you do with it
[41:31] see what you do with it
[41:33] see if you'll grab it if you grab it uh
[41:35] oh a seed's going to take hold in the
[41:38] womb and you're going to begin to
[41:39] manifest unbelief
[41:42] amazing
[41:44] these little spots
[41:46] you okay keep going
[41:48] page three okay
[41:52] and so an army first and getting ready
[41:54] for a battle the first thing he's got to
[41:55] do is he's got to select some soldiers
[41:57] they've got to be dressed for fighting
[41:59] they've got to be trained for fighting
[42:01] and i believe that the greatest battle
[42:03] that has ever fought is now ready to go
[42:06] into action i believe that god has been
[42:08] selecting his soldiers and i believe
[42:10] that he has been dressing them and
[42:11] training them and the battle
[42:14] and the battlefront is now set getting
[42:17] ready to start
[42:19] amen
[42:20] congratulations you're getting ready to
[42:22] start
[42:24] in the greatest battle that was ever
[42:25] fall
[42:26] see you had to you know it's um
[42:29] it was fitting to god to see to it that
[42:31] he would train like um with a father
[42:34] with the son he wants to
[42:36] um
[42:37] he'll raise him up in a certain way
[42:38] he'll teach him in a certain way he'll
[42:40] see that he can walk a certain way and
[42:41] walk without fall and then you know and
[42:43] he gets he gets to come like a soldier
[42:45] in the army you know you don't just take
[42:47] the first recruit on the first day and
[42:48] throw him on the front line no you're
[42:49] training you're getting ready you're
[42:51] equipping you're toughing him up you're
[42:53] getting mentally ready for the battle
[42:55] you're getting physically ready for the
[42:56] battle and then you fully equip him for
[42:58] the battle and that's what god's been
[42:59] doing to us he does the same way he gets
[43:01] you physically right he gets you
[43:02] spiritually right you're mentally right
[43:04] and then he equips you to have
[43:05] confidence in the things that you've
[43:06] been given to fight the enemy if a
[43:08] soldier goes to battle and he doesn't
[43:10] have confidence that his gun's going to
[43:11] fire when he's out there brother shea
[43:13] would you like to go on the the field
[43:15] without a gun that actually works in
[43:16] your pocket ain't no way in the world a
[43:19] police officer would want to go to
[43:20] battle without a gun that he's not sure
[43:21] about
[43:22] no he has to have confidence that
[43:23] weapons that he was issued are going to
[43:25] work and i have confidence that the word
[43:27] has been issued to me the sword of the
[43:29] spirit that's in the hand of in our
[43:31] hands by the faith of god it will work
[43:34] but if you don't believe it will work i
[43:36] promise you you won't pull the sword
[43:39] you'll use human reasoning understanding
[43:41] affections memories all kinds of things
[43:44] to get away from just using the thing
[43:45] god told you to use you won't speak the
[43:47] word you won't take the word because you
[43:49] don't have confidence in it somewhere
[43:51] along the line somebody told you you
[43:54] listened to a lie of the devil that
[43:56] caused unbelief something to sneak in
[43:58] and you no longer have confidence in the
[44:01] things of god or what god has given you
[44:04] see
[44:04] scars
[44:07] situations difficulties
[44:09] complexes
[44:11] disappointments
[44:13] all of these things creating unbelief
[44:16] and ultimately what is it trying to lead
[44:18] you to unbelief in god's word
[44:21] ultimately doubt that god is in control
[44:23] and gout god has equipped us and god is
[44:25] with us that's all it's trying to do
[44:28] the devil's slick
[44:30] very slick he knows what he's doing he
[44:32] knows how to get you
[44:35] um now
[44:36] he says now now remember it's not just
[44:39] christian science it's not just mind
[44:41] over matter
[44:42] the mind accepts the life which is the
[44:44] word of god and there it brings the life
[44:47] just your thought won't do it but the
[44:48] word of god thr word of god brought
[44:51] through the channel of your thoughts see
[44:53] that it's not the thought as christian
[44:56] science would make it mind over matter
[44:58] no that's not it but it's the mind
[45:00] accepts it it grasps it what is your
[45:03] mind controlled by your spirit and your
[45:05] spirit catches the word and that's the
[45:08] thing that has the life in it and it
[45:10] brings the life into you oh brother what
[45:13] that when that takes place when life
[45:15] comes down through that channel into you
[45:18] by the word of god it will manifest in
[45:20] you
[45:21] oh my
[45:22] so god's going to have
[45:24] an elect bride without spot or
[45:27] wrinkle right and you look at yourself
[45:29] how many have me not the only one said
[45:31] how am i going to be that what he wants
[45:33] me to be i look at i says i can't
[45:36] physically do this and then i realize i
[45:38] have to look up a little higher you're
[45:40] right i cannot do it but if i set my
[45:42] sights upon him the word and i let that
[45:45] word come in and i accept that and
[45:47] believe that the word itself will
[45:48] produce the life not me i have nothing
[45:51] to produce i can't manufacture the life
[45:54] of jesus christ you can't either none of
[45:57] you can live this message
[45:59] as the message is christ it'll take
[46:01] christ in you to bring forth the
[46:03] manifested life of christ on this earth
[46:05] what do i have to do with it be it unto
[46:07] me according to thy word i have to stop
[46:10] everything that would try to exalt
[46:11] itself try to take a preeminence in my
[46:14] life everything
[46:15] you think it's by any accident that this
[46:17] is the day in the age where technology
[46:19] has advanced to a point where brother
[46:21] branham could stand in the jc penney's
[46:23] and say what those things were were in
[46:25] hell i saw sitting in jcpenney you think
[46:28] it's any accident that we now have
[46:29] technology at our fingertips that can
[46:32] literally bring fifth dimensional
[46:34] hellish type things into view and have a
[46:36] direct influence on you every day of
[46:39] your life in your pocket
[46:41] you think that's an accident you don't
[46:43] think the devil's been studying this for
[46:45] thousands of years and he says i can
[46:47] totally trip them up they cannot stop
[46:49] looking at these things they cannot stop
[46:51] overcoming these influences i've got
[46:54] them i've got the music i've got the the
[46:56] the the imagery the technology and i can
[46:59] give it to them every second of every
[47:01] day of every hour
[47:03] you think there's any accident now that
[47:05] we have a direct link to the fifth
[47:06] dimension by the fourth dimension
[47:07] technology and science
[47:09] satan eden is here it's at its apex and
[47:12] it's not something you better play
[47:14] around with
[47:16] joseph didn't play around with the woman
[47:17] that tried to deceive him he took off
[47:19] and ran
[47:20] the man ran but then we began to play
[47:22] with these things and not realize you
[47:23] know that's a direct thing that the
[47:24] devil's using to trip you up and to get
[47:26] you into a problem and it gets you
[47:28] starting to doubt the word of god and we
[47:30] say well it's not a big deal
[47:31] it's a big deal man
[47:34] i am not honestly i'm not sugar coating
[47:36] that stuff at all
[47:37] no way at all those things won't be
[47:40] there
[47:41] one of these days you ain't going to
[47:43] have a cell phone in the millennium i
[47:45] promise you it's not going to be there
[47:47] you're not going to have these
[47:48] influences all around you no the devil
[47:51] will be chained by a chain of
[47:52] circumstances i promise you you're not
[47:54] going to see those type of influences
[47:56] having its rampage no way no way so we
[47:59] better not take these things lightly
[48:01] the devil knows what he's doing and he's
[48:03] studying you
[48:05] and the thought came okay i gotta hurry
[48:07] up because i gotta get some other
[48:08] thoughts more exciting to me i'm sorry i
[48:09] gotta go
[48:10] um
[48:12] see it's your mind has to open that door
[48:14] or it closes that door it has to listen
[48:17] to your conscience it listens through
[48:19] your memories it listens to your
[48:20] affections but when your mind closes
[48:23] itself off to those things and let god
[48:25] the spirit of the word come in it will
[48:28] blow all the rest of that stuff out of
[48:30] there
[48:31] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[48:33] every sensation and doubt is gone every
[48:36] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[48:38] there but the word of god and satan
[48:40] cannot battle against that
[48:43] he can whip you but he cannot whip god
[48:46] so the only thing you have to do in your
[48:47] weakness is take a hold of the word
[48:50] and then he fights the battle for you
[48:51] aren't you glad you can be honest enough
[48:53] and say i've you know oh remember
[48:55] brother chad you preached that sermon
[48:57] the secret invasion of the enemy's camp
[48:59] see
[49:00] little the devil doesn't understand
[49:02] weakness because he's perfect in beauty
[49:04] full of wisdom he's powerful he's
[49:06] created in such a way with onyx and
[49:08] bernacle and all these other things
[49:09] these beautiful stones he's amazing he's
[49:12] powerful he's perfect and then we behold
[49:15] jesus stricken smitten of god and cast
[49:17] down no beauty that we should behold him
[49:19] learning obedience through much
[49:20] suffering
[49:22] oh my isn't this interesting so the
[49:24] devil doesn't understand weakness
[49:26] so the devil doesn't understand how god
[49:29] could have a people be so weak and that
[49:31] weakness is actually the secret of their
[49:33] strength because they won't be relying
[49:35] upon their abilities they'll be putting
[49:37] their confidence in god and saying it's
[49:39] god that's going to do this in me it's
[49:41] not me i can't do it but god can do it
[49:46] and see this is that secret invasion of
[49:48] the enemy's camp that god is doing and
[49:51] god has let you see and now we know how
[49:53] to overcome
[49:56] so i want to use some examples and we'll
[49:58] take a little time i'll slow myself down
[50:00] if i can sorry
[50:02] the hebrew children
[50:03] now
[50:04] we all know that there was ten spies
[50:07] that went when they came out of egypt
[50:08] god delivered them by a mighty hand they
[50:10] brought him up to jericho and you can
[50:12] think about how they're going to think
[50:14] like god you delivered us from pharaoh
[50:16] you you you broke him and then you
[50:18] brought us out here to the red sea and
[50:20] you deliver us they complained the whole
[50:21] way you delivered us brought us through
[50:23] the red sea now you're bringing us up to
[50:24] jericho and now we see all these big
[50:27] giants in the way and they begin to
[50:29] doubt and remember it was ten spies see
[50:32] taste feel smell here imagination
[50:34] conscience reasoning affections you see
[50:36] ten
[50:37] it was ten spies that came with a lion
[50:39] report and said we cannot take it you
[50:42] know god did not have to allow there to
[50:44] be giants in that land
[50:46] but he did
[50:47] god was testing his children
[50:49] god was testing to see where is faith
[50:52] where can i find faith
[50:54] where are the people that won't be
[50:55] looking at the strength of their arms by
[50:57] looking at the promise of god that said
[50:58] i'm giving you this land this land
[51:01] belongs to you
[51:02] but see
[51:04] the devil began to sow and they began
[51:06] like brother bam said the devil has in
[51:08] every age begins to get you to doubt the
[51:10] promise of god's word for that age
[51:12] and the importance of it and the value
[51:15] of it
[51:16] so
[51:18] they saw the spies and became fearful
[51:20] and be and doubt snuck in they realized
[51:23] we can't take it because they weren't
[51:25] looking at the right things
[51:26] they kept looking around
[51:29] but joshua and caleb was there
[51:31] and a different spirit was upon them and
[51:34] they never looked at the strength of
[51:35] their arms they never considered their
[51:38] human weaknesses
[51:39] they had one thing down on the soul that
[51:41] was looking at one other thing the word
[51:43] of god that said we're more than able to
[51:45] take it
[51:47] now that's a story from thousands of
[51:49] years ago but it applies today you don't
[51:51] think god was allowing giants to come in
[51:53] the land confusing things difficult to
[51:56] understand obstacles in your way
[51:58] just to see will they take a hold of my
[52:01] word or will they doubt it
[52:05] it's a simple concept but this is the
[52:06] greatest battle that's ever been fought
[52:09] and it rages in you and it rages in me
[52:14] david
[52:15] now here's david so i want to talk about
[52:18] david's i'm gonna slow down talk about
[52:20] david's silent battle to victory
[52:23] and to defeat turn in your bibles to
[52:25] first samuel
[52:29] first samuel chapter 17. verse 33
[52:43] first samuel chapter 17
[52:45] verse 33
[52:51] and saul said to david thou art not able
[52:54] to go against the philistine to fight
[52:56] with him
[52:57] there's your backslidden believer that
[53:00] sounds just like a backslidden believer
[53:02] we are unable to take it and who do you
[53:04] think you are that you could take it
[53:06] remember the backslidden believer's not
[53:08] that far away from you you have
[53:09] two-thirds of you that is a backslidden
[53:11] believer
[53:12] your two-thirds of you is of the devil
[53:14] itself and it's constantly there
[53:15] buffeting you saying hey david you're
[53:17] not able to defeat that philistine
[53:19] remember when you fell here remember
[53:21] when you don't worry your backslidden
[53:23] believer isn't the guy beside you it's
[53:24] the guy looks at you in the mirror
[53:26] reminds you of the things that you
[53:27] failed and then times gone past don't
[53:29] worry you get to take saul wherever you
[53:31] go
[53:32] but you don't have to listen to him
[53:34] for thou art but a youth and he is a as
[53:37] a man of war from his youth and david
[53:40] said unto saul thy servant kept his
[53:43] father's sheep and there came a lion and
[53:46] a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[53:50] and i went after him and i smote him and
[53:54] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[53:56] he arose against me i caught him by the
[53:58] beard and i smote him and slew him thy
[54:02] servant slew both the lion and the bear
[54:04] and this uncircumcised philistine shall
[54:06] be as one of them seen he hath defied
[54:09] the armies of the living god david said
[54:12] moreover the lord that delivered me out
[54:14] of the paul of the lion and out of the
[54:17] paul of the bear and out of the hand of
[54:19] the philistines
[54:20] or
[54:22] he will deliver me out of the hand of
[54:24] this philistine david wasn't looking at
[54:26] his ability he's still a boy
[54:28] david was looking at the hand of god
[54:30] that had brought him through all these
[54:31] other things why would he not
[54:34] see the different spirit that was in
[54:35] david than was in the hebrew children
[54:37] then why couldn't they say the same god
[54:38] that brought you brought us out of the
[54:40] hand of pharaoh the same god that took
[54:42] us through the red sea the same god that
[54:43] could is the same god that can overcome
[54:45] here at jericho why couldn't they have
[54:47] that spirit
[54:49] because they couldn't they were
[54:50] unbelievers but unbelievers
[54:53] they just can't believe but believers
[54:56] we're called to believe no matter what
[54:57] the situation no matter what the
[54:58] circumstance no matter how big the giant
[55:00] doesn't matter
[55:02] it does not matter that's why brother
[55:03] bam said it does not matter what we
[55:04] overcome but how we overcome the what
[55:07] doesn't matter but the how that matters
[55:09] we overcome by the word
[55:11] and so david first overcame in his mind
[55:15] back there on the desert taking over the
[55:17] fields or whatnot taking care of his
[55:19] father's sheep just being faithful to do
[55:21] those things that god called him to do
[55:23] back there god was training his little
[55:25] warrior his little believer his soon to
[55:28] be king samuel had come chosen him said
[55:31] god's not looking on the outside god's
[55:32] looking on the heart there's something
[55:34] different about david and here comes
[55:36] david and god begins to train his
[55:38] soldier
[55:39] bringing him through certain things
[55:41] taking raising the strength from the
[55:42] bear to a lion how many times has god
[55:45] brought you from a bear to a lion he
[55:47] delivers you from one obstacle and you
[55:48] say god god praise god he delivered me
[55:51] then he braces the power of the obstacle
[55:53] a little bit more and you say well god
[55:55] praise god he deal with me and then he
[55:56] brings goliath you're like yeah i can't
[55:58] do it
[55:59] let's be honest this is truthful you
[56:01] know i'm right right
[56:03] he began to begin to sow those little
[56:04] seeds of doubt
[56:07] but david was looking at something and
[56:09] david was convinced that god was with
[56:11] him
[56:12] and he began to speak like a believer
[56:15] you know believers talk a certain way
[56:17] they don't just think a certain way they
[56:19] don't just say amen on church on monday
[56:21] through friday they talk different
[56:23] they don't talk like saul they talk like
[56:26] david
[56:27] david he's more than able i'm more than
[56:30] able he's with me he promised he'd never
[56:32] leave me he'd never forsake me it's not
[56:35] me it's the spirit of god that will
[56:36] deliver me from that obstacle it's not
[56:39] me it's not you it's him
[56:42] so believers just talk differently
[56:45] and then
[56:46] so he had this showdown then with
[56:48] philistine in first samuel it says and
[56:51] dave and and said david to the
[56:53] philistine thou cometh to me with the
[56:55] sword and with the spear and with the
[56:57] shield but i come to thee in the name of
[56:59] the lord god of hosts the god of the
[57:01] armies of israel whom thou hast defied
[57:05] this day will the lord deliver
[57:08] thee into my hand and i will smite thee
[57:12] and take thine head from thee
[57:15] and i will give
[57:17] and i will give the carcass of the host
[57:20] of the philistines this day unto the
[57:22] fowls of the air and to the wild beasts
[57:24] and of the earth that all the earth may
[57:27] know that there is a god in israel so it
[57:30] looks to me like david's thoughts began
[57:32] to express in his words that he was
[57:35] speaking and his words became manifested
[57:38] in what he then did
[57:40] but the battle was fought in the mind
[57:43] the battle was one in the mind david
[57:46] wasn't looking at himself he was looking
[57:48] at the promise of god and he overcame
[57:50] goliath in his mind
[57:54] not when he cut off his head with the
[57:55] sword that would soon come the
[57:57] manifestation of that creative thought
[57:59] would soon come into its existence but
[58:01] david here a son of god a little creator
[58:03] in and of himself he began to think the
[58:05] right things remembering he wasn't
[58:07] remembering bad things he was
[58:08] remembering the good things he was
[58:10] remembering the hand of god that
[58:11] delivered him all the other times and he
[58:13] began to have the right thinking the
[58:15] right memories coming into view then he
[58:17] began to talk like a believer he began
[58:19] to express the word with the mouth
[58:21] confession is made unto salvation right
[58:23] and began to say the right things and
[58:25] then he began to perform the right
[58:27] things
[58:28] see
[58:29] little creators on earth again
[58:31] greatest battle ever fought
[58:34] but the man says he had f-a-i-t-h in
[58:37] jesus
[58:38] j-e-s-u-s
[58:40] five rocks five stones one little stone
[58:43] in there and it started off with it
[58:45] started whirling around like this and
[58:47] that and the holy ghost got a hold of
[58:49] that rock and it went right and it went
[58:52] and away it went goliath went to the
[58:54] ground and that's the way it's done
[58:57] i love the simplicity that's found in
[58:59] christ
[59:00] it's so simple so humble it's not great
[59:04] it's not oh wow it's got to be amazing
[59:06] no it's so simple
[59:08] f-a-i-t-h in the promises of god's word
[59:11] knowing that i am his chosen david knew
[59:14] he was going to that throne who could
[59:16] stand in his way
[59:17] do you know where you're going
[59:19] do you believe the prophet like david
[59:21] had to have confidence in his prophet
[59:23] they called him out and said god's not
[59:24] looking at your outward parts god's
[59:25] looking at something he saw a little
[59:27] predestination of himself a seed gene of
[59:29] god down on the inside and as samuel
[59:31] came as a prophet anointed david and
[59:33] said you will be the next king of israel
[59:36] you are coming to that throne what
[59:37] confidence that must have had in david i
[59:40] wonder if it led i wonder if he thought
[59:41] about that you know as that bear came in
[59:43] looking at that line he's probably
[59:44] looking at himself saying that's a big
[59:46] bear
[59:47] that's that's a really big wow those
[59:49] teeth they're pretty big
[59:51] but he said you know what i remember
[59:52] samuel just the other day he anointed me
[59:54] and he called me out and god chose me
[59:56] and he's anointed me and i gotta come to
[59:58] that throne i wonder if he was thinking
[1:00:00] those things i wonder if those thoughts
[1:00:02] were going through his mind
[1:00:04] then he began to say you know what if
[1:00:06] god before me who could be against me
[1:00:09] come here bear
[1:00:10] and then the lion and then the
[1:00:12] philistine nothing could stop him
[1:00:15] nothing
[1:00:17] so in timothy second timothy
[1:00:22] we're gonna go
[1:00:24] a little turn
[1:00:25] second timothy verse 2
[1:00:28] chapter 2 verse 3
[1:00:35] says thou therefore endure hardness
[1:00:38] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[1:00:42] no man that worth entangleth himself
[1:00:45] with the affairs of this life
[1:00:48] that he may please him
[1:00:50] who hath chosen him to be a soldier
[1:00:55] now i want to bring that into view
[1:00:57] because of some things we're going to
[1:00:59] look at in david and samson
[1:01:01] no soldier entangleth himself in the
[1:01:04] affairs of this life
[1:01:06] if you're a soldier you're commissioned
[1:01:08] to do a certain thing so you have to be
[1:01:11] focused on doing the right thing
[1:01:14] just the moment you forget that you're
[1:01:15] in a battle that's when he'll come just
[1:01:18] a moment when you're tired and weary and
[1:01:20] you just want to check out and relax
[1:01:22] that's when he'll come this is when it
[1:01:24] got david this is when it got samson
[1:01:27] you'll find they were both going to
[1:01:29] sleep
[1:01:30] they were both tired they were both
[1:01:33] weary and they were going to relax
[1:01:36] and then the defeat
[1:01:38] let's look at it
[1:01:40] ii samuel
[1:01:41] chapters 11
[1:01:43] and it came to pass
[1:01:45] after the year was expired at the time
[1:01:49] when kings go forth to battle that david
[1:01:52] sent joab and his servants with him and
[1:01:55] all of israel and they destroyed the
[1:01:58] children of amen and besieged
[1:02:01] rabban
[1:02:03] but david tarried still at jerusalem
[1:02:06] and it came to pass in an evening tide
[1:02:10] that david arose from his
[1:02:12] bed
[1:02:14] and walked upon the roof of the king's
[1:02:16] house and from the roof he saw a woman
[1:02:19] washing herself and the woman was
[1:02:20] beautiful to look upon uh oh david
[1:02:24] you're in the wrong place
[1:02:25] at the wrong time at a time when kings
[1:02:28] are supposed to be out on the
[1:02:29] battlefield fighting not entangling
[1:02:32] themselves in the affairs of this life
[1:02:34] you're supposed to remember david you're
[1:02:36] supposed to be fighting and here you are
[1:02:38] lounging upon your bed just needing a
[1:02:40] break
[1:02:41] you think there's any reason why how
[1:02:43] many have said i'm just so tired all the
[1:02:45] time you get a good 10 hour sleep and
[1:02:47] i'm tired i'm exhausted
[1:02:49] you think there's any reason that you
[1:02:50] don't think the devil is trying to
[1:02:52] exhaust you and make you tired
[1:02:55] honestly brother man point blank said we
[1:02:57] were not created to live in an age like
[1:03:00] this it's too busy it's too constant
[1:03:03] it's too fast you're exhausted you're
[1:03:05] mentally worn out why is the devil

[1:04:47] wow
[1:04:49] this social media i'm telling you right
[1:04:51] now nonsense you have it if you want to
[1:04:54] but i'm telling you the devil knows how
[1:04:56] to wear you out
[1:04:57] mentally and spiritually wear you out
[1:04:59] he's working his trap he's going to set
[1:05:01] it
[1:05:02] he's going to set it so you have to be
[1:05:04] mindful of the tactics of the enemy
[1:05:06] remember thousands of years he's now
[1:05:08] brought it to his apex he's now got his
[1:05:11] soldiers and his equipment and his
[1:05:13] guns and his
[1:05:14] uh armaments he's got it all perfect man
[1:05:17] he's got every i mean he's got the ak-47
[1:05:20] shooting 50 caliber bullets out of these
[1:05:22] things man he knows what he's doing
[1:05:27] where am i
[1:05:30] um
[1:05:34] okay yes
[1:05:35] at a time when kings go to battle
[1:05:38] yeah
[1:05:39] he's trying to wear you out make you
[1:05:40] tired
[1:05:43] okay but here's what you have to
[1:05:44] remember first thessalonians if you want
[1:05:46] to write it down you don't have to turn
[1:05:48] but first thessalonians chapters 5
[1:05:49] remember this
[1:05:51] but ye brethren are not in darkness that
[1:05:54] the day should overtake you as a thief
[1:05:57] ye are all the children of light and the
[1:06:01] children of the day we are not of the
[1:06:04] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[1:06:07] not sleep
[1:06:08] as do others let us watch and be sober
[1:06:13] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[1:06:15] and they that are drunken or drunken in
[1:06:17] the night but let us who are of the day
[1:06:19] be sober and put on the breastplate of
[1:06:22] faith and love and the helmet and the
[1:06:24] hope of salvation
[1:06:27] it looks like we are not to get tired
[1:06:29] and worn out and weary it looks like we
[1:06:31] are children of the light it is not a
[1:06:33] time for sleeping it is not a time to
[1:06:35] allow satan's eden to wear you out and
[1:06:38] dull your senses your spiritual senses
[1:06:40] to the things of god it's time to arise
[1:06:43] and shine our light came
[1:06:45] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:06:48] me
[1:06:49] not just you it risen upon me
[1:06:52] so now the potentials
[1:06:54] of that little lily that was buried
[1:06:56] under the muck in the mud of your life
[1:06:57] in my life now it can come forth now
[1:07:00] that right light can come and pull out
[1:07:02] the life that he had down on the inside
[1:07:03] and bypass the complexes bypass the
[1:07:06] weaknesses bypass all that nonsense and
[1:07:09] filth of your life now is the time see
[1:07:12] it was just a betting ground anyhow your
[1:07:14] life was just the betting ground with
[1:07:15] the sea gene of god down on the inside
[1:07:17] just waiting for the right light to come
[1:07:19] to bring that life into view that's so
[1:07:21] exciting to me
[1:07:23] so david's
[1:07:25] mental silent battle
[1:07:28] when he overcame the lion the bear
[1:07:30] and the goliath
[1:07:32] brought that public or those private
[1:07:34] battles into a public victory right
[1:07:37] but then david's private
[1:07:39] thoughts
[1:07:41] his defeat
[1:07:42] alone upon his bed brought forth the
[1:07:44] public defeat
[1:07:46] in the ministry of david you could say
[1:07:49] you see what i'm saying
[1:07:50] and mine
[1:07:52] the whole battle was fought and finished
[1:07:54] right there
[1:07:57] now let's look at samson turn in your
[1:07:58] bibles to judges 15 14.
[1:08:03] samson born under a nazarite vow
[1:08:06] he was told to by his mother and never
[1:08:09] let a razor come to his head those seven
[1:08:12] little locks upon his head
[1:08:14] and you know as a kid i remember having
[1:08:16] the coloring books and we all used to
[1:08:17] look at the pictures of samson these
[1:08:19] massive huge muscles every kid wanted to
[1:08:22] be just like him but then the prophet of
[1:08:24] god brings it into view and says don't
[1:08:25] use a little shrimp of a fella he was a
[1:08:27] ruddy shrimp man
[1:08:29] because he said god would not share his
[1:08:31] glory with man it would be no great
[1:08:32] thing to see a man with the shoulders
[1:08:34] the size of a you know cadillac you know
[1:08:36] picking up barn doors and carrying an
[1:08:38] oil he said he was a shrimp
[1:08:41] you think he was made fun of
[1:08:44] i just
[1:08:45] hang with me do you think samson could
[1:08:47] have been made fun of
[1:08:49] do you think jesus could have been made
[1:08:50] fun of do you think brother branham was
[1:08:52] made fun of
[1:08:53] you don't think there's a pattern to
[1:08:54] these things you don't think that there
[1:08:56] could have been some things in brother
[1:08:57] branham's childhood that created a
[1:08:59] complex in him that made him feel
[1:09:01] inferior to everybody that was around
[1:09:03] him that would make him to go up on his
[1:09:05] tippy toes when he's standing beside
[1:09:06] oral roberts
[1:09:08] you don't think he had some scars some
[1:09:09] weaknesses some complexes some some fear
[1:09:11] inferiority complexes he sure did you
[1:09:14] think he was made fun of oh yeah he was
[1:09:16] even made fun of by his daddy he says oh
[1:09:18] i have some boys but one
[1:09:20] you don't think that had an effect on
[1:09:22] him you don't think that it carried
[1:09:24] those scars his whole life
[1:09:27] and god allowed it it would serve his
[1:09:30] purpose in the end
[1:09:31] but here's samson
[1:09:33] shrimp of a fella seven little
[1:09:35] fight locks the other band says on his
[1:09:37] head
[1:09:38] it was quite a fella to look at i just
[1:09:40] have a feeling he got picked on a couple
[1:09:42] times
[1:09:43] in the uh
[1:09:45] at gym class or whatever
[1:09:47] and it was probably very interesting
[1:09:50] time but i don't know maybe it created a
[1:09:52] complex or two maybe you know at the
[1:09:54] time he was a little shrimp of a fella
[1:09:55] all the other kids would make fun of him
[1:09:56] you know and all the girls he just also
[1:09:58] all the pretty girls maybe there was one
[1:09:59] of those girls there he really admired
[1:10:01] her she was nice and kind till one day
[1:10:03] she laughed at him
[1:10:05] man that made him angry i don't know
[1:10:07] about this rotten thing
[1:10:09] i don't know it happened to brother
[1:10:11] branham's life
[1:10:13] yeah a girl laughed at him left a
[1:10:15] complex created a situation in his life
[1:10:18] a little little thing he'd have to
[1:10:20] overcome in the
[1:10:21] conscious realm of his memory at certain
[1:10:23] date and time he'd have to plug those
[1:10:25] things up but here comes samson
[1:10:28] told don't ever touch those locks of
[1:10:29] hair but he found his weakness was women
[1:10:32] he found his weakness was coming under
[1:10:34] the influence and being admired by
[1:10:36] another woman because probably he was
[1:10:38] picked on that's just me i don't know i
[1:10:39] could be wrong about that but i have a i
[1:10:42] won't go into why but i just have a
[1:10:44] feeling
[1:10:45] and so he his weakness became something
[1:10:48] of he was looking for the
[1:10:50] admirations of another woman okay
[1:10:54] and as time went on
[1:10:55] he uh he he found the wrong woman
[1:10:59] that gave him the affections that he
[1:11:01] desired delilah
[1:11:02] and i want you to read in the bible here
[1:11:04] of judges 15
[1:11:07] and when he had come to leia
[1:11:09] the philistines shouted against him and
[1:11:11] the spirit of lord was mighty upon him
[1:11:14] and the cords that were upon his arms
[1:11:16] became as flax and that was that was
[1:11:19] burnt as fire and his bands loosed from
[1:11:22] his hands and he found the jaw bone of a
[1:11:24] of an ass and put forth his hand and
[1:11:27] took it and slew a thousand men thereof
[1:11:30] and samson said with the jawbone of an
[1:11:32] ass heaps upon heaps with the jawl of an
[1:11:35] ass i
[1:11:37] slain a thousand men uh-oh
[1:11:41] he never acknowledged the spirit of god
[1:11:43] that was upon him he began to lift
[1:11:44] himself up in the situation
[1:11:47] and so something had began to start he
[1:11:48] started to see a little crack in the
[1:11:50] armor of samson something had caused him
[1:11:53] to want to exalt himself i wonder why
[1:11:56] why he needed to feel that he was doing
[1:11:58] something why did he need to have
[1:12:00] something to do in it why did he feel
[1:12:02] like i i i want to show everybody that i
[1:12:04] did this why couldn't he just say like
[1:12:06] david said the lord provided the lord
[1:12:08] spirit of god was upon him you see i bet
[1:12:11] there was a complex or two along the way
[1:12:13] i bet there was something that he was
[1:12:14] trying to compensate for a weakness of
[1:12:17] some sort and i think you can continue
[1:12:19] to see this if we turn to the next
[1:12:20] chapter judges 16 15
[1:12:23] and she said unto him how can't thou say
[1:12:26] i love thee with thine heart when thine
[1:12:29] heart is not with me
[1:12:31] thou hast mocked me these three times
[1:12:33] and hast not told me wherein thy great
[1:12:35] strength lieth and it come to pass when
[1:12:38] she pressed him daily with her words
[1:12:41] okay and urged him so that his soul was
[1:12:44] vexed unto death that he told her all
[1:12:47] his heart and said unto her there hath
[1:12:50] not come a razor upon my head for i have
[1:12:52] been a nazareth unto god from my
[1:12:54] mother's womb
[1:12:55] if i be shaven then my strength shall be
[1:12:58] gone shall go from me and i shall become
[1:13:01] weak and be like other men and when
[1:13:03] delilah saw that he had told her all his
[1:13:06] heart
[1:13:07] see what were her words trying to get to
[1:13:10] her heart his heart
[1:13:12] always
[1:13:13] see this delilah that was the thing that
[1:13:15] could overcome samson the cares of this
[1:13:17] world the pleasures of this life you
[1:13:19] don't think the devil will use something
[1:13:20] that's maybe uh satisfies or gives a
[1:13:22] comfort to you a false comfort you don't
[1:13:25] think the devil could use those china
[1:13:26] things to woo you and slowly what's he
[1:13:29] after he's after your heart
[1:13:31] he's not after you just trying to mess
[1:13:33] up no he wants your heart he wants to
[1:13:35] kill you he wants to spiritually kill
[1:13:37] you
[1:13:38] and so he has certain words that have
[1:13:40] come through the mind and they're always
[1:13:41] trying to get your heart
[1:13:43] so samson began to take the words and
[1:13:45] the affections of this woman and exalt
[1:13:48] them above the will in the word of god
[1:13:50] see the very thing he was raised and
[1:13:52] raised up and anointed to do he was
[1:13:54] overcome by
[1:13:56] he was raised up to destroy the
[1:13:58] philistines and he was brought under
[1:14:00] captivity of a philistine woman
[1:14:02] you know you were raised up to destroy
[1:14:05] satan's eden
[1:14:06] you're on this earth to utterly destroy
[1:14:09] it
[1:14:10] and bring the the kingdom of devil of
[1:14:12] the devil down
[1:14:14] how are you being entertained by it
[1:14:17] why do we find ourselves being
[1:14:19] entertained by the very thing you were
[1:14:21] meant and brought to this earth to
[1:14:22] destroy
[1:14:24] you see
[1:14:26] i hope it's if i'm going long i'm sorry
[1:14:29] it's just a little quiet all of a sudden
[1:14:31] um
[1:14:34] so
[1:14:38] he says here
[1:14:39] and when delilah saw that he told all
[1:14:41] his heart she sent and called for the
[1:14:43] lords of the philistines saying come up
[1:14:46] at once for he hath showed me all his
[1:14:48] heart and the lord of the philistines
[1:14:50] came up unto her and brought money in
[1:14:53] their hand brother brandon made it very
[1:14:55] clear
[1:14:56] oh and she made verse 19 and she made
[1:14:59] him sleep upon her knees and she called
[1:15:02] for a man and she caused him to shave
[1:15:05] off his seven locks of head of her his
[1:15:07] head and began to afflict him and his
[1:15:10] strength went from him
[1:15:12] what did what did delilah do put him to
[1:15:14] sleep
[1:15:15] make him exhausted make him tired worn
[1:15:19] out physically gotta go to sleep see the
[1:15:21] pattern david and samson worn out
[1:15:24] exhausted i need a rest i need a break
[1:15:27] can't do it no more i'm tired
[1:15:31] i hope i'm not the only one that's like
[1:15:33] tired in this age
[1:15:36] i know i'm not because i hear everybody
[1:15:38] say it
[1:15:41] so all of it was trying to get to one
[1:15:43] thing everybody make you exhausted get
[1:15:45] you weak get you tired
[1:15:47] so wear you out with the words and the
[1:15:50] uh the little thoughts from delilah
[1:15:52] thoughts of this world thoughts of
[1:15:54] compromising along the way all in an
[1:15:56] attempt to cause and create doubt in
[1:15:58] your life where then you could give up
[1:16:00] the source of your strength which is the
[1:16:02] word of god and the promise of god's
[1:16:04] word for this age and the value of that
[1:16:06] promise
[1:16:07] and then strip you of your strength
[1:16:10] like any other man you know without the
[1:16:12] spirit of god you're no better than the
[1:16:14] most rot and sinful person on this earth
[1:16:17] you know that there is nothing in and of
[1:16:19] yourself you're a filthy rotten thing
[1:16:22] except it be for the spirit and grace of
[1:16:24] god upon your life
[1:16:26] makes you ought to make you walk very
[1:16:28] humbly because if he ever removes his
[1:16:30] spirit from your life you're done
[1:16:33] you'll be taken captive and stripped of
[1:16:35] everything you've got
[1:16:39] now let's look at another one
[1:16:41] shamgar
[1:16:43] shamgar won the battle shamgar had a
[1:16:46] great victory and it all happened in his
[1:16:49] mind
[1:16:50] and then he manifested it brother
[1:16:52] branham convinced and concerned shamgar
[1:16:56] many of you he was one of the judges of
[1:16:58] israel many ministers never even seen
[1:17:00] that in the bible but he was one of the
[1:17:02] judges of israel one little verse wrote
[1:17:04] about him but i like him he was a man
[1:17:06] after my heart you know the philistines
[1:17:08] then every man did what he wanted to do
[1:17:11] so he we find that in israel there was
[1:17:13] raised up
[1:17:15] that he the israelites had raised up a
[1:17:17] whole lot of crops and the philistines
[1:17:18] would set back over there gambled and
[1:17:21] let them slave for them and here they
[1:17:23] would walk right in no unity among them
[1:17:25] go right over there and say hey i'll
[1:17:27] take up those crops and year after year
[1:17:29] they did that this little old fella one
[1:17:31] day he wasn't a warrior
[1:17:34] one thing he he had was his crop and i
[1:17:37] imagine him standing there after putting
[1:17:39] away his crop in the barn he looked at
[1:17:41] his little ragged kids and his wife and
[1:17:43] she needed a dress and
[1:17:45] he just got all of it laid up real nice
[1:17:47] and he was sitting there leaning saying
[1:17:49] well maybe we can eat this winter
[1:17:52] he heard something and he looked out the
[1:17:53] window and there was coming a thousand
[1:17:56] philistines marching march march march
[1:17:58] great big plates of armor all over him
[1:18:00] well-trained men spears and their hands
[1:18:02] marching right up to take all that he
[1:18:04] had
[1:18:04] he looked down at his kids he looked
[1:18:06] over at his wife and he was concerned
[1:18:09] but what was he he was helpless he
[1:18:12] wasn't a swordsman no he didn't say now
[1:18:14] wait i better go up to the school now
[1:18:16] and learn how to duel and creeds if he
[1:18:19] would have done that he that's all he
[1:18:21] would have known about but here's one
[1:18:23] thing that he did know he happened to
[1:18:25] think
[1:18:27] he happened to think
[1:18:29] i was born an israelite
[1:18:32] and god's promise to abraham my father
[1:18:36] was that thy seed shall possess the
[1:18:38] gates of his enemy
[1:18:41] and that was enough
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] so the battle when he defeated these i
[1:18:47] think 600 brother bam says a thousand
[1:18:49] philistines it all happened in his mind
[1:18:53] it wasn't physical the thought came
[1:18:55] through the right channel and faith rose
[1:18:57] up took a hold of that thought said i'm
[1:18:59] more than a conqueror
[1:19:01] thy seed shall possess the gates of thy
[1:19:03] enemy i find i'm a part of the right
[1:19:05] seed with the right promise who is this
[1:19:08] uncircumcised philistines coming my way
[1:19:10] you see the pattern just continues to go
[1:19:13] on
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:17] i want to bring another one into view
[1:19:19] jesus
[1:19:21] now his silent victory led to a victory
[1:19:24] for all of us
[1:19:27] and the greatest battle that was ever
[1:19:28] fought took place in the silence of
[1:19:31] gethsethme
[1:19:33] jesus in conferences 1960 jesus brought
[1:19:36] himself to a decision
[1:19:38] before going to calvary the broad the
[1:19:40] father brought his own son into a
[1:19:42] conference in gethsethamy while angels
[1:19:45] were taking their position to see what
[1:19:47] decision he would make oh it might not
[1:19:51] have been this way but let's just think
[1:19:53] about it i can hear them hear him say
[1:19:55] son
[1:19:56] do you desire to go to calvary
[1:19:58] there's a ban there waiting for you
[1:20:00] there's persecutions there's death
[1:20:03] there's murder laying on the way they're
[1:20:06] going to expose your body and they're
[1:20:07] going to strip your clothes off of you
[1:20:09] they're going to beat you to a pulp
[1:20:12] they'll pull the crown of thorns over
[1:20:14] your head and you will be screaming for
[1:20:16] mercy will you go on
[1:20:19] my
[1:20:20] what a decision how he was wrestling
[1:20:22] this out this battle this greatest
[1:20:25] battle
[1:20:26] calvary was calvary's victory took place
[1:20:29] in gethsethme
[1:20:30] that was just the manifestation of the
[1:20:33] overcoming that took place in gesethme
[1:20:36] in silence and in the battle of his own
[1:20:38] mind
[1:20:40] and so brother banham continues on he
[1:20:42] says in the breach
[1:20:43] and john started crying because no one
[1:20:46] was found worthy no one could even look
[1:20:48] at the book or take
[1:20:49] oh and take a human being john wept
[1:20:52] there was no one that could do it
[1:20:53] everything was lost and there came a
[1:20:56] voice from one of the elders standing in
[1:20:57] the midst of the four beasts and all the
[1:20:59] great host of heaven said don't weep
[1:21:01] john oh my the grace of god don't be
[1:21:03] brokenhearted john don't weep the lion
[1:21:06] of the tribe of judah hath prevailed the
[1:21:08] root and offspring of deva he prevailed
[1:21:11] which means he wrestled with and he
[1:21:13] overcome oh my in the garden of
[1:21:16] gethsethme when the blood dropped from
[1:21:18] his face he was overcoming
[1:21:21] the lion out of the root of david had
[1:21:24] prevailed and had overcome brother
[1:21:26] branham said this is the most sublime
[1:21:28] scripture in all the bible when real
[1:21:31] strength prevailed in weakness
[1:21:34] of a man that was overcoming in his mind
[1:21:38] and then he could get the victory for us
[1:21:40] all so his private victory in his mind
[1:21:43] brought a public victory for you and me
[1:21:46] don't ever let that go to get pushed off
[1:21:48] to the side don't let that become a
[1:21:50] little thing for you my goodness that
[1:21:52] was quite a battle he ra he fought and
[1:21:54] he did it for me and he did it for you
[1:21:58] spiritual amnesia
[1:22:00] he says now
[1:22:01] i was with oh so this is what i want to
[1:22:03] bring into view
[1:22:05] brother branham says now to be an
[1:22:07] american
[1:22:09] he says i have to uh i have to uh i was
[1:22:12] with george washington when he crossed
[1:22:13] the delaware he said to be an american i
[1:22:15] have to be identified with an american
[1:22:17] he says oh he bros up all those
[1:22:19] americans and he says you know i was
[1:22:20] with david when he overcame goliath he
[1:22:23] said i was there he said you know i was
[1:22:25] with moses when he went through the red
[1:22:27] sea i was there and you know what when
[1:22:30] jesus was battling out in gethsemane
[1:22:33] guess where you were
[1:22:35] you were there
[1:22:37] i believe that
[1:22:39] i believe that i believe i was there
[1:22:42] he hadn't yet separated from himself the
[1:22:44] feminist spirit i was there i had to be
[1:22:48] so you know what's going to give you
[1:22:49] prevailing strength to overcome you've
[1:22:51] already overcame
[1:22:53] you already fought it out you already
[1:22:55] have fought this battle in the mind of
[1:22:57] christ already thousands of years ago
[1:23:00] now your light is coming and bringing
[1:23:02] into view the expressed manifestation of
[1:23:04] that overcoming that took place two
[1:23:07] thousand years ago
[1:23:09] you were there in the garden of the
[1:23:10] catheter and you fought and overcame so
[1:23:13] if anything should give you an
[1:23:14] encouragement realize
[1:23:16] you're riding this trail again
[1:23:18] you've already fought this battle you've
[1:23:20] already overcome because you were with
[1:23:22] him when he was overcoming
[1:23:25] now i was with david when he was
[1:23:27] rejected of his brethren i was with him
[1:23:30] you were too if you're a christian you
[1:23:32] have to be identified in his rejections
[1:23:35] i was with the hebrew children in the
[1:23:37] fiery furnace when the fire could not
[1:23:39] burn them because of the presence of the
[1:23:41] fourth man i was with daniel in the
[1:23:43] lion's den i was there i was identified
[1:23:46] there when the angel of the lord
[1:23:47] identified him in there i most surely
[1:23:49] was with him at calvary i must be
[1:23:52] identified with him at calvary and i
[1:23:54] must be there
[1:23:56] to a place that where not also i was
[1:23:59] identified with him at calvary i died
[1:24:01] with him at calvary every christian must
[1:24:04] die with him at calvary you don't die
[1:24:07] with him if you don't die with him at
[1:24:09] calvary you can't be none of his i was
[1:24:12] there and when he died i died with him
[1:24:16] and when and then i was was with him
[1:24:18] when he was raised up from the dead i
[1:24:21] come up on easter morning with him in
[1:24:23] that resurrection whatever he did i was
[1:24:26] there with him every believer is of the
[1:24:28] same and now i am seated with him in
[1:24:31] heavenly places in christ jesus and the
[1:24:34] powers of hell have been conquered
[1:24:36] through him and every christian believer
[1:24:38] is seated the same way because you have
[1:24:41] to be identified
[1:24:43] now i find myself in these last days and
[1:24:46] many of the believing christians
[1:24:48] christians have identified are
[1:24:50] identified in his ministry he's the same
[1:24:53] yesterday today and forever and i find
[1:24:56] myself in this i in this day identified
[1:24:59] in his ministry do you find yourself the
[1:25:02] same way believing it walking with it
[1:25:05] notice that when he did he said the
[1:25:08] believer would do the same things the
[1:25:10] works that i do you also then you can be
[1:25:13] identified with him and when the
[1:25:14] reproach comes upon the word you can
[1:25:16] stand their approach like he did see
[1:25:18] identified with him so when he fought
[1:25:21] and overcame
[1:25:22] i overcame with him
[1:25:24] so now that i find myself identified in
[1:25:26] the same ministry here in this day i
[1:25:29] know i can overcome
[1:25:32] do you know you can overcome because
[1:25:34] you're already overcame
[1:25:36] you already did this you already have
[1:25:38] overcome
[1:25:39] this isn't a mystery this is something
[1:25:41] that he's brought into view no wonder
[1:25:43] there's a rock we can stand on in this
[1:25:45] final day
[1:25:49] can i bring another one
[1:25:51] mary
[1:25:52] you know mary had a silent battle
[1:25:55] a silent victory and a public victory
[1:25:59] the angel lord came to mary one day it
[1:26:01] says the angel came said fear not mary
[1:26:04] thou sound favor with god and behold
[1:26:06] thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:26:09] where was this womb
[1:26:11] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:26:13] name jesus he shall be great and shall
[1:26:16] be called the son of the most high and
[1:26:19] the lord god shall give him the throne
[1:26:21] of his father david and he shall reign
[1:26:23] over the house of jacob forever and his
[1:26:25] kingdom there shall be no end
[1:26:28] then mary said unto the angel how shall
[1:26:30] this be seen i know no man boom
[1:26:32] immediately uh oh
[1:26:34] something in her mind no man has ever
[1:26:36] been born outside of being with another
[1:26:38] man a woman must be with a woman okay
[1:26:40] now here comes the answer what will she
[1:26:41] do mary here's your showdown it's in
[1:26:42] your mind the battles are aging
[1:26:45] and the angel answered and said the holy
[1:26:47] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:26:49] of the most high shall overshadow thee
[1:26:51] therefore also this holy thing that
[1:26:53] shall be borne in thee it shall be
[1:26:55] called the son of god
[1:26:57] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:27:00] lord and be it unto me according to the
[1:27:02] word
[1:27:03] so immediately when that doubt and
[1:27:04] reasoning started to come in boom
[1:27:06] something came up
[1:27:08] faith started to rise up and say no i
[1:27:10] believe what you're saying is the truth
[1:27:12] i believe you chose me and i believe i'm
[1:27:14] the vessel i'm the womb that i'm going
[1:27:16] to accept your word i'm going to accept
[1:27:18] it into the womb of my mind i'm going to
[1:27:20] accept it and i'm going to bring it
[1:27:21] forth and that's exactly what happens
[1:27:23] with you and me exactly we may say how
[1:27:26] can it be that i'll be found spotless
[1:27:28] and without wrinkle how can it be he's
[1:27:30] predestinated you to not fall like he
[1:27:32] fell he's predestinated you to stand and
[1:27:34] he sent the word the light the
[1:27:35] manifestation needed to bring you to
[1:27:38] your full potential
[1:27:40] the devil is not pulling this trick over
[1:27:42] on us
[1:27:43] we value the word that we've been given
[1:27:45] in this hour
[1:27:47] it's the very mind of god
[1:27:51] so the bride's now time
[1:27:55] in her silence
[1:27:56] to bring forth victory or defeat
[1:28:00] revelations i'm sorry christ is a
[1:28:02] mystery of god it says
[1:28:04] and said satan oh you know she turned
[1:28:06] around and listened to him
[1:28:08] but the eve and the last day she's not
[1:28:10] going to do it because she's
[1:28:12] predestinated not to no sir god knows
[1:28:16] god's going to do it he knows he'll have
[1:28:19] it she'll be there without spot the
[1:28:21] church would be there without spot or
[1:28:23] wrinkle she's going to stand there in
[1:28:25] the splendor of him in his word made
[1:28:28] manifested
[1:28:31] now
[1:28:32] remember the church
[1:28:34] that christ in the true church is the
[1:28:36] continuation of the book of acts but the
[1:28:38] book of revelation shows how the
[1:28:40] antichrist spirit anti-word spirit
[1:28:43] would come in the church and defile it
[1:28:46] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:28:49] it exposes satan revealing his works and
[1:28:52] his attempted destruction of god's
[1:28:54] people and the discrediting of god's
[1:28:56] word
[1:28:57] right down to the time that he is cast
[1:28:59] into the lake of fire he fights it he
[1:29:01] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:29:04] people get a true revelation of the true
[1:29:06] church and what she is
[1:29:09] and what she stands for that she can do
[1:29:12] the greater works she will be an
[1:29:14] invincible army
[1:29:17] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:29:19] spirit spirits within the framework of
[1:29:22] the christian church and by god's spirit
[1:29:24] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:29:27] spirit satan will be as power powerless
[1:29:30] before her he will be as definitely
[1:29:32] thought of today as when christ
[1:29:33] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:29:35] over him in the desert yes satan hates
[1:29:38] revelation but we love it with true
[1:29:41] revelation in our lives the gates of
[1:29:43] hell cannot prevail against us but we
[1:29:46] will prevail against them
[1:29:48] do you find yourself saying
[1:29:50] that you find yourself bringing that
[1:29:53] into view when the goliath shows up at
[1:29:55] your scene
[1:29:57] can you go back and say you know the
[1:29:58] same god that delivered me from the paul
[1:30:00] of the bear and the jaws of a lion and
[1:30:02] this uncircumcised philistine he's going
[1:30:04] to deliver in every obstacle and every
[1:30:07] difficulty and everything that i find in
[1:30:08] my way because he predestinated me to
[1:30:11] stand he knew that i would overcome he
[1:30:13] knew that i would be here in satan's
[1:30:15] eden and this is as dark as it has to be
[1:30:18] because there's such a great light here
[1:30:19] to fight this foe there has to be this
[1:30:22] bad you know that don't complain that
[1:30:23] things are bad it's got to get this dark
[1:30:26] but the fact that the darkness is
[1:30:28] covering the earth how horrible it is
[1:30:29] for the unbeliever but brother man said
[1:30:31] but how wonderful it is for the believer
[1:30:33] because it's in the darkness that the
[1:30:34] light can shine forth so now this great
[1:30:37] light that came in this hour is calling
[1:30:40] forth for these other lights to arise
[1:30:42] and shine because this is the hour that
[1:30:44] we have been called to
[1:30:46] and we've been trained and we've been
[1:30:48] taught and we've been equipped we know
[1:30:50] how to fight this battle
[1:30:52] we don't have to say i don't know how to
[1:30:54] overcome yes you do
[1:30:55] you know how to overcome
[1:30:57] don't believe that kind of a lie you
[1:30:59] know what to do you know how to fight
[1:31:01] and you know the tactics of the enemy
[1:31:04] musicians will you come
[1:31:07] i want you to turn in a few scripture
[1:31:09] verses if this is okay i did this with
[1:31:10] the youth and i'd like to do it with you
[1:31:12] you are now designated youth
[1:31:14] okay
[1:31:15] ii timothy
[1:31:17] verse 1.
[1:31:23] remember we look at ourselves we see
[1:31:25] nothing but weakness and failure the
[1:31:27] only thing you can say that you're good
[1:31:29] at is you're a good failure
[1:31:31] but if we look at what god says about us
[1:31:33] we can say
[1:31:34] oh my
[1:31:36] greater see that's in me than he that's
[1:31:37] in this world i'm more than an overcomer
[1:31:40] if you know not to say it braggingly but
[1:31:43] the devil can overcome he can't overcome
[1:31:45] you he can only overcome you when you
[1:31:47] put away the word
[1:31:48] that's the only time he can overcome you
[1:31:50] ever and he'll always start in your mind
[1:31:52] that's where the battles fall
[1:31:55] and i know you know these things but i
[1:31:56] just felt to bring it to your attention
[1:31:59] second timothy verse 1 or chapter 1
[1:32:02] verse 7
[1:32:03] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[1:32:07] fear but power love
[1:32:09] and of a sound mind
[1:32:10] you hear that i want you to read it
[1:32:13] we're going to read it together
[1:32:17] for god hath not given us a spirit of
[1:32:20] fear but of power love and of a sound
[1:32:24] mind

[1:32:26] change it up
[1:32:28] i want where it says us
[1:32:30] you insert your name
[1:32:32] for god hath not given kyle the spirit
[1:32:36] of fear but of power and of love and of
[1:32:39] a sound mind

[1:32:45] 4 verse 4.
[1:32:51] first john 4
[1:32:53] verse 4.
[1:33:05] say amen when you're
[1:33:06] there ye are of god little children and
[1:33:10] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:33:13] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:33:15] world
[1:33:16] now where it says you put your name in
[1:33:18] it as we read
[1:33:20] ye are of god little children and have
[1:33:23] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:33:27] is in kyle than he that is in the world
[1:33:31] okay
[1:33:32] i'm training soldiers how to fight
[1:33:35] i know it sounds simple
[1:33:37] but god's hiding in simplicity
[1:33:41] you see it's not the great mental
[1:33:43] it's very calm very settled you have to
[1:33:46] take the word and speak the word
[1:33:49] turn to isaiah 26 verse 3.
[1:33:54] and i i hope i'm not i'm not meaning to
[1:33:56] be condescending i'm not at all you have
[1:33:58] to understand these are the basics of
[1:34:00] our warfare
[1:34:04] isaiah 26 3.
[1:34:08] i'll read it while you're turning thou
[1:34:09] wilt keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:34:13] mind is stayed on thee
[1:34:16] because he trusted in thee
[1:34:19] now where it says him insert your name
[1:34:22] and let's read it
[1:34:24] thou wilt keep kyle in perfect peace
[1:34:28] whose mind is stayed on thee because
[1:34:32] kyle trusted in thee
[1:34:37] wow
[1:34:38] f-a-i-t-h-n-j-e-s-u-s
[1:34:43] no match for the devil
[1:34:45] he may look like quite a foe it may look
[1:34:47] like you cannot overcome that but it's
[1:34:50] f a i t h n j e s u s the word
[1:34:56] all you have to do is let it come
[1:34:58] through the right channel speak the word
[1:35:01] and let the holy spirit guide that stone
[1:35:03] to take out your enemy
[1:35:05] you don't have to do it
[1:35:08] i want you to return in your bibles to
[1:35:10] psalms 91.
[1:35:17] psalms 91 verse 1.
[1:35:28] david said
[1:35:30] i keep the word always before me that i
[1:35:32] would not sin against thee
[1:35:34] you know
[1:35:35] he was the meditation of his heart his
[1:35:38] dwelling place
[1:35:39] isaiah 91 says he that dwelleth in the
[1:35:42] secret place
[1:35:44] of the most high shall abide unto the
[1:35:46] shadow of the almighty i will say of the
[1:35:49] lord he is my refuge and my fortress and
[1:35:54] my god in him will i trust i love how
[1:35:57] david makes it personal
[1:35:59] david isn't just saying he is to other
[1:36:00] people he's saying he's my refuge my
[1:36:04] strength my fortress
[1:36:06] he had that revelation of the rock
[1:36:08] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:36:10] snare of the fowler and from the noise
[1:36:12] and some pestilence he shall cover thee
[1:36:14] with his feathers and under his wings
[1:36:16] thou shalt trust his truth shall be my
[1:36:20] shield and my buckler thou shalt not be
[1:36:24] afraid for the terror by night or the
[1:36:26] arrow that flyeth by day nor for the
[1:36:29] pestilences that walketh in darkness nor
[1:36:32] for the destruction that wasteth at
[1:36:34] noonday a thousand shall fall at thy
[1:36:37] side and ten thousand on thy right hand
[1:36:40] but it will not come nigh thee
[1:36:42] only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
[1:36:45] and see the reward of the wicked because
[1:36:48] thou has made the lord which is my
[1:36:51] refuge even the most high my habitation
[1:36:56] i don't think it was just because david
[1:36:58] was dwelling in a physical temple
[1:37:00] i believe his habitation was in his mind
[1:37:03] i believe he let the word of god have
[1:37:05] the preeminence in his mind i believe
[1:37:08] that was the place that he gave god the
[1:37:10] preeminences and therefore he could
[1:37:12] stand upon a rock and could take out
[1:37:14] every foe
[1:37:15] will you stand with me
[1:37:21] i pray that it was a blessing
[1:37:23] i enjoyed studying it i enjoyed going
[1:37:26] through it and
[1:37:28] it is encouraging me god's words and
[1:37:30] encouragement to us you know as we get a
[1:37:32] little bit it would say older and mature
[1:37:35] i guess in the lord you begin to realize
[1:37:37] you're not moved by the winds the
[1:37:39] earthquakes
[1:37:40] or the fires it's always the still small
[1:37:43] voice that calls you out of the cave and
[1:37:45] puts you recommissioned back into your
[1:37:48] post of duty as a soldier of christ that
[1:37:50] still small voice
[1:37:52] how he speaks and how that calls forth
[1:37:54] god's elect each and every time so my
[1:37:56] prayer was that the word was just a
[1:37:58] blessing to you and that you can say
[1:38:00] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:38:03] may your word be established in my mind
[1:38:05] may it be the confession of my my lips
[1:38:07] and it may be the action of my life the
[1:38:09] very purpose of my living
[1:38:11] you just bow your heads for a word of
[1:38:13] prayer
[1:38:14] heavenly father we so thank you for this
[1:38:16] day lord i'm so thankful for your word
[1:38:19] it means just so very much to me lord
[1:38:22] it's all it's my strength it's my shield
[1:38:24] it's my buckler it's my hiding place
[1:38:26] lord may we all each individually find
[1:38:29] you to be our hiding place not in the
[1:38:31] cares or the pleasures of this life no
[1:38:34] it's a delilah whispering trying to put
[1:38:36] you to sleep
[1:38:37] lord but may we find that we are
[1:38:38] entertained by the holy spirit you
[1:38:41] prophet said that the bride is
[1:38:42] entertained by the holy spirit the word
[1:38:44] that's our entertainment that's the
[1:38:46] place that we love to dwell we love to
[1:38:48] be lord that's the place of peace safety
[1:38:52] joy overflowing father if there's any
[1:38:55] here today lord that they had had some
[1:38:59] the devil i pray has been exposed that's
[1:39:02] my prayer the devil could be exposed in
[1:39:04] the hiding places that he hides in lord
[1:39:07] and little avenues and little channels
[1:39:09] that he might have had an influence into
[1:39:11] each and every one of our lives maybe
[1:39:13] we've been trying to cover up a scar or
[1:39:15] a weakness lord but we are covering it
[1:39:17] with the wrong thing lord let us cover
[1:39:20] it with the word of god and with prayer
[1:39:21] lord that's what we were told to do
[1:39:23] father
[1:39:24] you've done all that you needed to do
[1:39:27] you've provided everything we have need
[1:39:29] of for this journey through satan's eden
[1:39:32] lord may your bride and i know she will
[1:39:34] not be overcome but may she overcome the
[1:39:37] satan's eating she was predestinated to
[1:39:39] it lord we love you we commit ourselves
[1:39:42] afresh and anew to you take us lord and
[1:39:44] use us for your purpose and for your
[1:39:46] glory we love you in jesus name amen
[1:39:51] god bless you it's really an honor and
[1:39:53] privilege to speak to you this morning
[1:39:55] and brother chad if you don't mind
[1:39:57] coming brother if you've got a song
[1:39:58] oh they were beaten
[1:40:01] hopeless beating and so weary
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:08] are waiting
[1:40:10] for this day of liberty
[1:40:16] just to see the glorious sunrise
[1:40:20] from the highest mountaintop
[1:40:23] in this dawn we'll see their shackles
[1:40:27] falling off
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:32] rising of the
[1:40:35] a new day has begun
[1:40:39] rays of mercy made us free from sin
[1:40:43] today
[1:40:46] o the joy that fills my soul
[1:40:51] for the message is my all
[1:40:55] thank you jesus for this day of liberty
[1:41:02] brave is empty
[1:41:04] he's raised in water day
[1:41:09] because i live
[1:41:12] you shall live as well he said
[1:41:18] resurrected with christ jesus lift your
[1:41:22] hands toward the sky
[1:41:25] your reward is
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:43] for us that day
[1:41:47] our redeemer and our god
[1:41:51] soon he'll catch away his bride
[1:41:55] thank you jesus for this day of victory
[1:42:03] amen god bless you
[1:42:05] i tell you i was certainly edified by
[1:42:07] the word this morning very much
[1:42:09] encouraged amen just to take god at his
[1:42:12] word just to confess it and believe it
[1:42:14] amen and not be afraid
[1:42:16] i was thinking he's given those examples
[1:42:18] how many how many examples we could go
[1:42:20] through in the bible
[1:42:22] remember david wasn't afraid of the
[1:42:25] revelation that came through samuel
[1:42:28] it didn't scare him he was willing to be
[1:42:30] identified with what the prophet said he
[1:42:33] was
[1:42:34] and it gave him overcoming power
[1:42:36] and remember mary was not afraid of the
[1:42:39] revelation that came from the angel
[1:42:41] messenger she went directly before she
[1:42:43] felt one thing brother benham said
[1:42:45] before she felt any change in her body
[1:42:47] she went and confessed it to elizabeth
[1:42:49] amen and then as soon as she confessed
[1:42:51] that elizabeth began to prophesy being
[1:42:53] filled with the holy ghost she wasn't
[1:42:56] afraid
[1:42:57] of what the angel messenger said she was
[1:43:00] willing to confess it and it and it gave
[1:43:02] her power to overcome
[1:43:06] i say help us never to be afraid of what
[1:43:08] the prophet told us
[1:43:10] about what god has done for us and who
[1:43:12] we are in this day let's believe it
[1:43:14] let's confess it let's focus on it and
[1:43:17] let that revelation give us overcoming
[1:43:19] power
[1:43:20] amen god is certainly good
[1:43:23] i say it was really good to have brother
[1:43:25] emanuel back i think he's in the booth
[1:43:26] translating but he's back from oregon he
[1:43:29] and his wife it's good to have them back
[1:43:31] appreciate the message i appreciate the
[1:43:33] sacrifice of our brother may the lord
[1:43:35] bless him
[1:43:36] and also i appreciate that song special
[1:43:38] sister naomi that was a real blessing
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:42] blessed me and encouraged me amen
[1:43:45] tell your god is good
[1:43:47] there's a lot of things amen i want to
[1:43:49] be more careful of
[1:43:51] i want to keep i want to keep myself
[1:43:53] preserved
[1:43:55] for this word so that this word can live
[1:43:57] through this body of flesh
[1:43:59] man god is still never taking away free
[1:44:02] moral agency you're still the vessel he
[1:44:04] wants to use to have victory in the he's
[1:44:06] still the power that we'll overcome but
[1:44:08] he's given us the choice of what we
[1:44:10] yield ourselves to and that choice will
[1:44:12] determine how easy or how hard this is
[1:44:15] going to go
[1:44:16] and i said i want to use the power of
[1:44:18] free moral agency that he's put in my
[1:44:20] hand and i want to choose to surrender
[1:44:22] myself to him and and keep myself
[1:44:25] separated from the world for his use so
[1:44:28] that he can do what he's promised to do
[1:44:30] in this age
[1:44:31] i'm encouraged to be more determined
[1:44:34] than ever to keep myself separated
[1:44:37] unto him
[1:44:38] amen let's bow our heads and pray thank
[1:44:40] you lord jesus for this day
[1:44:42] thank you for this word i appreciate the
[1:44:44] gift you placed in our brother and the
[1:44:46] sacrifice he made to yield himself to
[1:44:49] your hand
[1:44:50] so that you could use him to bring this
[1:44:52] word and this word will change our lives
[1:44:54] lord it is changing our lives it's
[1:44:57] encouraging us in a better way i pray
[1:44:59] god that you would come and take full
[1:45:01] possession of these vessels

[1:45:27] to go
[1:45:28] yield to it that the word might live in
[1:45:31] us
[1:45:32] and might live through us and may you
[1:45:34] gain your victory in this day through
[1:45:36] your bride
