[0:00] be it unto me
[0:05] according to thy
[0:08] world according to
[0:12] thy promises
[0:17] [Music]
[0:25] the truth that sets me
[0:28] free according to
[0:32] thy word o lord
[0:38] once again
[0:49] [Music]
[0:56] says
[1:04] the truth that sets me free
[1:08] [Music]
[1:10] according to your word oh lord
[1:15] be it unto me
[1:20] hallelujah praise the lord was good to
[1:23] see you this morning
[1:25] their heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:27] for your word
[1:28] as we begin to read lord and this
[1:30] wonderful scriptures that you've given
[1:32] to us
[1:33] lord let it be more than an intellectual
[1:35] reading lord
[1:36] more than what a mind can comprehend but
[1:39] we're asking you for divine revelation
[1:41] on your word
[1:43] lord anybody with literacy can read but
[1:45] lord
[1:46] you've written something here between
[1:48] the lines for your bride to pick out
[1:51] god you've written something in this
[1:52] love letter lord that you've written in
[1:54] such a way that
[1:55] only the one nearest and dearest to you
[1:57] can catch it lord
[1:59] and i pray that you'd give us that
[2:00] revelation those eyes to see and ears to
[2:02] hear
[2:03] what it is you're truly saying in your
[2:05] word i pray that your spirit would
[2:07] anoint
[2:08] us to speak and to hear the truth of
[2:10] your word
[2:11] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:14] let's read this together before we see
[2:16] it in
[2:16] john chapter 5 verse 39.
[2:23] search the scriptures for in them you
[2:25] think you have eternal life
[2:27] and they are they which testify of me
[2:30] you can be seated you can probably tell
[2:32] by the reading of the scripture that
[2:34] we're
[2:34] we're continuing on with the same
[2:36] thought search the scriptures
[2:38] for they are they that testify of me
[2:40] amen
[2:41] because we found out that jesus was
[2:43] sitting here and
[2:44] and and there's there's always
[2:48] somebody willing to contest the revealed
[2:50] word it's amazing but
[2:51] whenever god brings the revelation of
[2:53] this word there's always somebody
[2:55] willing to contest that and contradict
[2:58] it and fight against it and jesus is
[3:00] simply saying
[3:01] search the scriptures amen the same
[3:04] scriptures in which you think you have
[3:05] eternal life
[3:06] they're the same ones that testify of me
[3:10] and the bride has come to the same point
[3:12] i believe you know she can say
[3:13] search the scriptures for in them you
[3:16] you think you have eternal life but they
[3:17] are they that testify
[3:19] of who we are the position that we're in
[3:21] what god has been doing and what the
[3:23] mystery he's had in the back part of his
[3:25] mind
[3:25] it's laying here in the scriptures and
[3:28] it's been dug out it's been
[3:29] it's been mined out in this day and held
[3:31] out for us to see and the bride can see
[3:33] it she can catch it
[3:35] amen she's the the mystery of the bride
[3:37] has been laying in this word the whole
[3:39] time
[3:40] and in this last day he has peeled the
[3:43] veil off of it
[3:44] and he begins to show it and then he
[3:46] shows all the types and all the shadows
[3:48] and there you have the seventh seal is
[3:50] laying all all the way through in every
[3:52] type and every shadow
[3:54] and all the mysteries through the bible
[3:56] there's christ
[3:57] you can see jesus christ in types but
[3:59] every time you see jesus christ in types
[4:01] if you go back and look a little closer
[4:03] you'll find
[4:04] there's a woman there in mystery also
[4:07] there's a bride laying there
[4:09] with the mystery with the shadow in the
[4:11] shadow of the shadow is the bride
[4:15] and this last day we go back and read
[4:17] the bible and all of a sudden it doesn't
[4:18] read like it used to read
[4:20] amen same words the words haven't
[4:22] changed you don't have to alter the
[4:24] words you don't have to change the text
[4:26] in any way
[4:27] all you have to re do is read it with
[4:29] your eyes wide open
[4:30] and there you see she's there and she's
[4:33] there and she's there
[4:34] and she's there praise the lord
[4:39] hallelujah let's turn to genesis
[4:43] as we we look at this we'll start all
[4:45] the way back in genesis
[4:47] brother benham said in the seventh seal
[4:49] i'm not quoting verbatim so you have to
[4:51] forgive me if i get a little wrong
[4:53] but he says if i had time i'd go back
[4:55] and show you the seven seals spoke of
[4:57] all the way back in genesis in the
[5:00] beginning
[5:01] and it's just amazing to me he makes
[5:04] statements like that
[5:05] and he doesn't always have time to go
[5:07] back and break it all the way down
[5:09] but what he's trying to do is he's
[5:10] trying to point it out and then point it
[5:12] out
[5:13] and he says i'm just hitting the high
[5:15] spots just enough so you'll know what
[5:17] i'm talking about
[5:18] amen because he said when the seals open
[5:21] he said that
[5:22] he said that unveiled the entire bible
[5:26] it unsealed the entire bible but brother
[5:29] branham did not have
[5:30] time in the rest of his ministry on
[5:32] earth to take every single scripture
[5:35] that was referring to this
[5:36] every place that showed the bride he
[5:38] didn't have time
[5:39] so he just hit the high spots just
[5:41] enough so that you would know what it is
[5:43] amen and once the keys are given to the
[5:46] bride
[5:47] the keys can she can take those same
[5:49] keys and unlock the mystery in every
[5:51] type and every
[5:52] shadow it's laying there but she can't
[5:55] be afraid
[5:56] amen to explore the promised land that's
[5:59] been given to her she can't be afraid
[6:01] to venture out into the message and take
[6:03] the keys that's been given to us by a
[6:05] prophet in this day
[6:06] and search the scriptures for they are
[6:09] they that testify of me
[6:12] so you can't be afraid of that amen
[6:14] there's a great fear sometimes
[6:16] in saying you can't take a scripture
[6:19] amen that the prophet didn't use
[6:22] my goodness just think amen just think
[6:25] for a minute
[6:26] brother brenham said i came he said i
[6:29] preached what paul preached
[6:32] is that the truth when he was beyond the
[6:35] curtain of time
[6:36] amen and they and they he asked he said
[6:38] you'll be judged with your group and he
[6:39] said what about paul said paul will be
[6:41] judged
[6:41] he says well i preached what paul
[6:43] preached and they were all laying there
[6:44] and they all said they were resting on
[6:46] that how many of you are
[6:48] resting on that brother brandon preached
[6:51] what paul preached but he didn't stand
[6:53] in the pulpit
[6:54] and read romans
[6:58] and come back the next day amen and read
[7:00] first corinthians
[7:02] and come back the next day and read
[7:04] second corinthians
[7:06] he preached what paul preached but he
[7:08] was able to
[7:09] take what paul preached and he would use
[7:12] examples in the old testament paul never
[7:14] touched
[7:15] he would pull scriptures out of the old
[7:17] testament that paul didn't refer
[7:18] to but yet he preached what paul
[7:20] preached
[7:22] he had so much confidence that he was
[7:24] going to come to judgment and be judged
[7:26] with his group
[7:27] he had so much confidence that he was
[7:29] going to pass the judgment
[7:30] because he preached what paul preached
[7:33] even though he didn't say verbatim
[7:35] will only verbatim what paul said he was
[7:38] able to take
[7:39] paul's message and find it all through
[7:42] the old testament
[7:44] amen
[7:46] [Applause]
[7:49] once once revelation locks in the bride
[7:52] is not afraid of the scriptures anymore
[7:54] she's not afraid of the message anymore
[7:56] she's not scared why because without
[7:59] revelation
[8:00] there's a fear uh i'll get it wrong i'll
[8:02] get the cow
[8:03] eating grass in the top of the tree the
[8:06] only way you can get
[8:07] a cow eating grass in the top of the
[8:09] tree is if you don't know what the whole
[8:11] picture is supposed to look like
[8:12] but by revelation you see the mystery of
[8:15] the seventh seal
[8:17] you see the bride coming of christ you
[8:20] see what's unfolded in our day
[8:22] and now once you see the big picture you
[8:25] can go down into the details
[8:26] because the details will fit the big
[8:28] picture every time
[8:31] the only way you'll get the cow in the
[8:33] grass and the top of the tree
[8:35] amen is if you don't know the big
[8:37] picture
[8:38] if you don't have revelation and without
[8:41] revelation
[8:42] there brings a fear and with fear we're
[8:44] afraid to venture away from jordan too
[8:47] far
[8:48] we've crossed into the promised land
[8:51] amen joshua has brought us over to the
[8:53] promised
[8:54] land but you know i'm afraid to get too
[8:57] far because i know
[8:58] if i can see jordan i'm in a good
[8:59] position amen
[9:01] but over the next hill is another valley
[9:04] that belongs to the children of israel
[9:06] they've got to get away from shiloh
[9:08] they've got to move away
[9:10] amen from jericho and they've got to get
[9:12] into the full possession
[9:14] of the full land and our full possession
[9:16] in this day is the whole word of god
[9:18] the entire bible hallelujah
[9:23] this is not the time for kindergarten
[9:25] this is not first grade
[9:27] this is time for a fully mature bride
[9:30] [Applause]
[9:31] who is what the manifestation of the
[9:34] full word
[9:37] on display in a people on earth
[9:40] today and she's not afraid of the word
[9:44] not afraid of the bible not afraid of
[9:47] the message
[9:49] why because she sees it and once you see
[9:53] it
[9:54] you see it you can't not see it you just
[9:57] see it
[9:58] and if you've seen it then you can't
[10:00] help but see it in ruth you can't help
[10:02] but see an
[10:02] esther you can't help but see it in
[10:04] deborah
[10:06] you can't help and see it in the woman
[10:08] that was given to adam you can't help
[10:10] but see
[10:10] it once you see it once you really see
[10:13] it
[10:14] everywhere you look you see it
[10:18] praise god
[10:21] so we can't be afraid
[10:25] can't be afraid of the word of god i
[10:27] can't say
[10:28] i can't go there in the scriptures
[10:30] because brother never read that
[10:32] scripture
[10:34] he said the opening of seals unlocked
[10:36] the entire bible
[10:39] so there's not parts that are off limits
[10:41] to the bride
[10:42] [Music]
[10:43] amen so paul
[10:46] uh brother brennan preached what paul
[10:48] preached but then we're told
[10:51] excuse me we're told that this same
[10:53] message
[10:55] will go to the jews have we been told
[10:58] that
[10:59] by the two witnesses in revelations 11
[11:01] is that correct
[11:02] [Music]
[11:05] so the two witnesses in revelations 11
[11:08] amen the the coming of moses and elijah
[11:11] to the jews
[11:13] they're going to preach this same
[11:14] message to the jews
[11:16] so they're going to gather the 144
[11:19] thousand around
[11:21] pull up their laptop and push play so
[11:23] that they can hear the prophet
[11:25] [Music]
[11:26] because they're coming to the same
[11:27] message
[11:30] they're coming to the same message but
[11:32] they may not play one
[11:34] tape they may not have one book
[11:37] but it's the same message
[11:42] hallelujah praise god
[11:46] it's by revelation
[11:50] hallelujah as as time continues on we
[11:53] realize
[11:53] more and more how crucial revelation
[11:55] really is
[11:57] because intellectual understanding amen
[12:00] will tie us at knots and
[12:01] back us into corners and and and and
[12:04] have us fearful
[12:05] and timid and afraid but revelation
[12:07] takes all fear away
[12:12] genesis chapter 1
[12:15] let's go to genesis chapter 1 and we'll
[12:17] begin at verse 26
[12:22] you pray for me the devil don't like me
[12:26] and that's fine by me the more he
[12:30] dislikes me the happier i am
[12:32] the more he rages and the more he fights
[12:34] and the more he tries to deflect
[12:36] the more i realize i must be making him
[12:38] mad
[12:40] and if i'm making him mad and if i'm a
[12:41] threat to his kingdom
[12:43] i'm perfectly happy in that position
[12:46] he rages but he can't win and he can't
[12:48] he can't have victory
[12:50] he's already defeated
[12:53] genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[12:57] and god said let us make man in our
[12:59] image after our likeness and let them
[13:01] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[13:03] and over the fowl of the air
[13:04] and over the cattle and over all the
[13:06] earth and every
[13:08] and over every creeping thing that
[13:10] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[13:12] man in his own image
[13:13] and the image of god created he him male
[13:16] and female created he
[13:18] them and god blessed them and god said
[13:21] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[13:23] replenish
[13:24] the earth and subdue it and have
[13:25] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[13:27] over the fowl of the air and over every
[13:29] living thing that moveth
[13:30] upon the earth so we find out this is in
[13:34] the sixth day of creation
[13:35] and brother branham says you can this
[13:37] seventh seal spoke of all the way back
[13:39] in the beginning in creation
[13:41] and so we find that god here in the very
[13:44] first chapter
[13:45] in genesis god is revealing the mystery
[13:48] of what's in his mind
[13:51] he has a desire he has a thought amen he
[13:54] wants an
[13:54] earth that's inhabited with sons and
[13:56] daughters of god that's what brother
[13:58] brenham told us
[13:58] so he begins amen after the judgment
[14:01] that
[14:02] has taken place upon the earth the earth
[14:04] covered in darkness and covered in water
[14:06] amen he goes in and he begins to reform
[14:10] the earth
[14:11] to the image that he has in his mind
[14:14] and so now what's in his mind is
[14:16] becoming manifest
[14:17] through day one and day two and day
[14:20] three
[14:21] and day four and day five and he's
[14:23] coming all the way through the seals
[14:25] here in creation
[14:26] and he's revealing what's been in the
[14:28] back part of his mind as earth begins to
[14:30] take form and takes shape
[14:32] and what's he doing he's making a
[14:33] habitation for his people
[14:37] but then amen on the sixth day amen
[14:40] under the sixth seal
[14:41] he is going to make something in his own
[14:45] image not just something that's in his
[14:47] mind but something that reflects his
[14:49] very own image
[14:50] so he makes the man and he makes him
[14:52] male and female
[14:53] but this man is still spirit man amen
[14:56] and still a spirit being at this
[14:58] but in that spirit man is male
[15:02] and female so that we could come along
[15:06] in this day
[15:07] and go back and say that's me right
[15:10] there search the scriptures
[15:13] amen they are they that testify me where
[15:15] are you right
[15:16] here amen because when god come out as
[15:19] the great logos amen
[15:20] it was it was a spirit form amen in the
[15:23] form of the logos
[15:24] amen christ before he was jesus christ
[15:27] before he was born the baby
[15:28] come out from god amen to reflect what
[15:30] god was
[15:31] and in him was all the attributes of god
[15:35] both male and female
[15:39] where are you right here all the way
[15:43] back in the beginning
[15:45] and look at the charge that was given
[15:47] them he blessed them and god said unto
[15:49] them be fruitful multiply and replace
[15:51] the earth and subdue it
[15:52] and have dominion over the fish of the
[15:54] sea or the fowl of the air and over
[15:56] every living thing that moveth upon the
[15:58] earth
[15:59] amen that charge to subdue and have
[16:02] dominion
[16:04] was given to the man both male and
[16:06] female
[16:10] hallelujah so we find all the way back
[16:14] in the beginning in the book of genesis
[16:17] in chapter one
[16:18] he's coming through revealing what's in
[16:20] his mind
[16:22] breaking the seals of the mystery of his
[16:24] mind
[16:25] by by for putting the light in place and
[16:28] moving the heavens
[16:29] up and and putting the grass in place
[16:31] and the trees in place
[16:33] and the fish in place in the birth and
[16:34] he he's revealing until he comes up
[16:37] amen to the crowning act he meant and he
[16:39] comes all the way up
[16:41] to revealing something that reflects who
[16:43] he
[16:44] is his very own nature something that's
[16:46] in his image
[16:47] and he makes man a spirit man male and
[16:50] female and then we know he takes the man
[16:54] and he puts him in the in a body of
[16:56] flesh amen so that he can be known
[16:59] because he was like the great spirit
[17:00] like the holy ghost moving
[17:02] amen over all of god's creation having
[17:05] dominion and authority
[17:06] but none of the creation could interact
[17:08] with their god
[17:10] is that right so he takes adam and puts
[17:13] him into a form of flesh
[17:14] made out of the dust of the earth so he
[17:16] can interact with all the creation so
[17:18] now they could see their god
[17:21] he's done the same thing with jesus
[17:22] christ amen it was god who was brooding
[17:25] over the world
[17:26] it was god who was orchestrating things
[17:28] and running everything but
[17:29] man amen could not amen interact or see
[17:32] or touches god
[17:33] until he came in the form of jesus
[17:35] christ
[17:37] and when he was here when adam was down
[17:40] here
[17:40] interacting with the animals naming the
[17:42] animals he made took possession in the
[17:44] garden of eden
[17:45] god says it's not good that man shall
[17:47] dwell alone it's not
[17:49] good that he should just be male and
[17:51] female in one vessel it's not good
[17:53] so he laid him to sleep and he pulled
[17:55] out amen the ingredients to make the
[17:57] woman
[17:58] and he made the woman amen and then he
[18:00] presented the woman he woke up adam
[18:01] presented them back together again
[18:03] and he said it is very good
[18:07] and then he moves into the seventh day
[18:12] and the scripture says he rested
[18:17] because everything that he was going to
[18:19] do to portray what his will and desire
[18:21] and what was in his mind
[18:22] he had already done it it was already
[18:25] there
[18:25] if you wanted to know him just look at
[18:28] what he made
[18:29] just look at the man and the woman
[18:31] having dominion over the earth and now
[18:33] you know god
[18:35] he revealed it in six days the seventh
[18:37] day doesn't reveal anything
[18:42] it's the seals all the way in genesis
[18:44] chapter one
[18:47] comes to the seventh day it says chapter
[18:49] two verse one thus the heavens and the
[18:51] earth were finished
[18:52] and all the host of them so his work was
[18:54] finished
[18:56] after his work's finished he comes to
[18:58] the seventh and he said on the seventh
[18:59] day god ended his work
[19:01] which he had made and he rested on the
[19:03] seventh day from all his work
[19:04] which he had made and god blessed the
[19:07] seventh day and sanctified it because
[19:09] that in it he had rested
[19:10] from all his work which god had created
[19:12] and made
[19:13] so the work took place in the six amen
[19:16] the seventh was the silence
[19:18] was the mystery what was the seventh the
[19:22] seventh was the resting of the one who
[19:23] did
[19:24] all six so then
[19:27] we go over to revelation chapter five
[19:29] we'll just pick this up quickly
[19:32] verse one this is the book of the
[19:34] generation of adam and the day
[19:36] that god created man in the likeness of
[19:38] god made he him
[19:40] male and female created he them and
[19:42] blessed them and called their name adam
[19:44] in the day when they were created
[19:47] so now we find out that when he created
[19:50] the man the male and the female he
[19:53] created them
[19:54] and blessed him and called their name
[19:56] adam so
[19:57] when the woman come up amen when he made
[19:59] the woman when he took
[20:00] out of the side of adam the rib amen and
[20:03] he
[20:04] and he split his spirit from masculine
[20:06] to feminist and he made a woman
[20:08] that woman as soon as she was formed
[20:10] amen
[20:11] her name was adam her name didn't change
[20:15] when she was with him her name was adam
[20:18] when she was separated from him her name
[20:20] was
[20:20] adam she was adam
[20:25] i mean do you see the mystery you see
[20:28] the message
[20:29] amen when she was separated out and put
[20:32] into another form
[20:33] and when she come forth in another form
[20:35] now this is the feminine form
[20:36] it's the feminine form of adam
[20:40] she is adam he is adam
[20:44] together they are adam
[20:48] where's adam he's there which one both
[20:54] remember god did not call her woman
[20:57] adam called her woman adam gave her a
[21:00] title amen
[21:03] god did not call her eve adam called her
[21:06] eve
[21:07] and she received her name after she
[21:09] became adulterous
[21:10] and her name amen her name symbolizes
[21:14] her adultery it references her adultery
[21:17] become the mother of all living so
[21:20] amen she shouldn't have ever had a
[21:23] different name
[21:25] she should have always been adam
[21:31] because we have always been with jesus
[21:35] christ amen
[21:36] when he come out as the lawyers when he
[21:37] was the attributes in the mind of god we
[21:39] were there amen when the logos came out
[21:41] with god we were there amen when he
[21:43] formed it into a body of flesh
[21:44] we were there and that's what the
[21:47] scripture says so it's what the prophet
[21:49] says and then when he's separated out
[21:50] it's all the same thing all the time she
[21:54] is him and now she
[21:58] is dwelling in bodies of hybrid flesh
[22:01] but that's not the she this isn't the
[22:02] she we're talking about
[22:04] it's the inward man amen it's the life
[22:06] on the inside
[22:07] it's the life of god down in the soul
[22:10] that is coming to manifestation through
[22:12] the new birth
[22:12] amen that is christ
[22:16] that is the very life of god amen now
[22:19] living and being on display through the
[22:22] veil
[22:22] of hybrid flesh the hybrid flesh is not
[22:26] her the hybrid flesh is not him it's the
[22:29] life
[22:29] on the inside being portrayed through
[22:32] the hybrid flesh
[22:36] hallelujah so now we're seeing
[22:40] our day all the way back in genesis
[22:45] this great mystery that the that the
[22:47] seals have unlocked this great mystery
[22:49] that the message is actually pointing us
[22:51] to
[22:53] the message amen before that
[22:57] that he begins to declare his message he
[22:59] first has to tie together
[23:00] all the loose ends so the preaching on
[23:03] the serpent seed and godhead and
[23:06] water baptism in jesus name and all
[23:08] that's tying together all the loose sins
[23:11] and he's got to tie together all the
[23:12] loose ends before he can declare his
[23:14] message
[23:16] i understand that so the message isn't
[23:19] serpent seed godhead
[23:20] water baptism no denomination that's not
[23:23] the message
[23:24] that's the ministry amen of the seventh
[23:26] angel the seven church eight messenger
[23:28] tying together all the loose ends that
[23:30] was left down through the church ages
[23:31] and when he's done tying together then
[23:34] down comes the angel
[23:36] then down comes the mighty angel christ
[23:38] revelations 10
[23:39] 1 to do what to reveal the thunders the
[23:42] mysteries that lay
[23:43] and the seals the symbols of the seals
[23:46] amen when
[23:47] after he's tied together the loose ends
[23:49] then the message
[23:50] comes so we can make a big mistake in
[23:54] thinking the message is malachi 4
[23:56] that the message of serpents see that
[23:58] the message is water baptism in jesus
[24:00] that's not the message friends that's
[24:02] fixing what had been
[24:04] left off by the reformers that was the
[24:06] completion of the reformation
[24:11] but the completion of the reformation
[24:13] will bring us to the restoration
[24:16] [Applause]
[24:17] the restoration is back the full word
[24:19] coming back in the manifestation
[24:23] hallelujah friends hallelujah
[24:27] you can be in the message every so many
[24:29] years and not even know what the message
[24:30] is
[24:32] we've been in the message so long and we
[24:34] can become masters in theology on
[24:36] serpency
[24:38] masters in theology on godhead masters
[24:40] and theology
[24:41] we can debate with theologians on water
[24:43] baptism and they have no ground to stand
[24:45] on
[24:47] i mean we can take some of our sunday
[24:48] school kids amen and they can
[24:50] and they can explain water baptism
[24:52] through the scriptures
[24:53] that nobody can deny that they're
[24:55] staying right with the word the whole
[24:56] time
[24:57] but that's yet not the message
[25:02] the message is christ
[25:06] male and female
[25:12] hallelujah amen
[25:15] i hope that doesn't scare you that's the
[25:18] truth
[25:19] that's nothing but the truth so we've
[25:21] got people who have degrees
[25:24] they have that not real degrees but
[25:26] they've got degrees
[25:28] and and message doctrine degrees and
[25:31] servicing water badminton godhead no
[25:32] denomination blah blah blah blah blah
[25:34] and we've mastered him we studied him we
[25:36] got the scriptures we've got the bible
[25:37] studies we got it all lined out
[25:39] amen but that's not yet the message
[25:42] [Applause]
[25:44] the message is christ
[25:48] hallelujah those things are essential we
[25:50] believe all of that amen that's just the
[25:51] word amen we believe that
[25:53] amen it was the word being brought back
[25:56] amen and put back in place
[25:57] so that the word himself could come back
[25:59] to the church
[26:02] hallelujah praise the lord i don't want
[26:05] to get off too far
[26:07] you just hang tight praise god so we
[26:09] find in the old testament all the way
[26:11] back in the beginning
[26:12] amen this mystery of the message is
[26:14] laying here
[26:15] amen in the man and the woman amen being
[26:18] one
[26:20] coming from the same source the woman
[26:21] doesn't come from a separate place she
[26:23] comes from the same place
[26:25] she comes into her own manifestation but
[26:27] she's still the same thing
[26:29] she is adam
[26:32] it's amazing amen when she can become
[26:35] talking to the serpent amen
[26:37] and the serpent if he wanted to address
[26:39] her the woman
[26:41] he would have to say adam
[26:45] we know the serpent could speak because
[26:46] he talked to her so when the serpent
[26:48] wanted to get the woman's attention
[26:50] he would have to say adam
[26:56] hallelujah i love the message
[27:01] i love when god by revelation will take
[27:04] tradition and crumble it at our feet
[27:08] because the denominations have a certain
[27:09] understanding amen
[27:11] but the message is come amen to bring us
[27:13] out of a traditional understanding
[27:16] and bring us to the revelation of the
[27:18] true word
[27:21] so we start off in genesis chapter 1 and
[27:24] we see the mystery there
[27:26] but let's go to the very end of the old
[27:29] testament let's go to malachi
[27:34] see we're looking at search the
[27:36] scriptures there that testify of me
[27:40] where can you find the bride genesis
[27:43] chapter one
[27:44] praise the lord you find her where you
[27:46] find the bridegroom if you find the
[27:48] bridegroom in chapter one
[27:49] you can find the bride in chapter one
[27:53] now let's go to the last two verses
[27:56] of the old testament malachi chapter
[27:58] four verse five
[28:01] behold i will send you elijah the
[28:03] prophet before the coming of the great
[28:05] and dreadful day of the lord
[28:06] and he shall turn the heart of the
[28:07] fathers to the children and the heart of
[28:09] the children to their fathers
[28:10] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[28:12] curse
[28:14] so here the very end of the old
[28:16] testament
[28:17] lays out a prophecy for elijah to come
[28:20] but it says here
[28:21] behold i will send you a lie to the
[28:24] prophet
[28:25] who's the you
[28:28] who's why oh you who's the you that's
[28:30] the bride
[28:31] right there there she is search the
[28:34] scriptures
[28:35] they are they that testify me right
[28:37] there elijah the prophet was sent to me
[28:39] amen he was sent to me to turn my heart
[28:42] back to the faith of the fathers
[28:45] all the way in chapter one she's there
[28:48] all the way in the last two verses of
[28:50] the old testament she's there
[28:52] and she's everywhere in between
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] hallelujah i mean we could we could just
[28:58] start rattling off stories
[29:00] and start showing she's there and she's
[29:02] there and she's there and we've done
[29:03] that over the last several years we've
[29:05] looked at story after story we looked at
[29:07] deborah
[29:07] deborah coming as the fourth judge amen
[29:10] under an eagle anointing
[29:13] you know from the tribe of dan under an
[29:16] eagle anointing
[29:17] under the four seal anointing you have a
[29:19] woman who becomes judged
[29:20] what a mystery in the bible amen where
[29:23] god
[29:23] will not allow a woman to be a priest
[29:25] never have a woman who's a king
[29:27] but now he will ordain a woman to be a
[29:29] judge
[29:30] in the book of judges amen it sticks out
[29:32] like a thumb it's like
[29:33] what is this in the scriptures it
[29:35] doesn't make any sense
[29:37] it's like god totally forgot all his
[29:39] principles of headship
[29:40] it's like he totally forgot everything
[29:42] in leadership that he had set up
[29:44] and he had structured everywhere else in
[29:46] israel everywhere else for everything
[29:47] else
[29:48] amen he structured it a certain way but
[29:50] when he gets here
[29:51] you've got this thing hanging out in the
[29:53] book of judges like a thumb what is it
[29:55] it's there to get your attention it's a
[29:58] woman
[29:59] the fourth judge amen under the flag of
[30:01] dan
[30:02] under the eagle and what's she there to
[30:04] do she's there to declare the bride's
[30:06] ministry
[30:07] under the fourth seal
[30:10] and it's in the story and it's the story
[30:14] of deborah it's under the story of
[30:18] deborah
[30:19] amen when there's a victory that's going
[30:21] to come over the gentile
[30:22] amen and that victory that's going to
[30:24] come she prophesies
[30:26] it'll come by the hand of a woman
[30:31] what's it what is this story it doesn't
[30:34] make any sense
[30:35] yes it does it makes perfect sense once
[30:37] you know the message
[30:38] and you've seen the mystery it's
[30:40] unlocked amen what debra is doing
[30:42] what the victory in the hand of the
[30:44] woman is doing what is going on amen and
[30:46] it wasn't a jewish woman that had
[30:48] victory it was a gentile
[30:50] woman because when the king their
[30:52] oppressor their antagonist
[30:53] amen when he was running from the battle
[30:55] he runs into a tent
[30:57] and i didn't look it up i don't have all
[30:58] the names but go back in judges and read
[31:00] it
[31:02] comes back and do this tennis woman she
[31:03] invites him in and she lays him down to
[31:05] sleep
[31:07] so it's going to be okay you stay right
[31:09] here
[31:11] because the enemy is going to be slayed
[31:13] in your tent
[31:16] because the biggest enemy you got is the
[31:19] one looking you in the mirror every
[31:20] morning
[31:22] this old hybrid flesh amen this old
[31:25] nature of the earth
[31:26] amen that's the thing that has to be
[31:29] destroyed and where is the enemy going
[31:31] to be destroyed for the gentile bride
[31:33] in her tent
[31:37] because your hybridization is going to
[31:39] change into a glorified body
[31:41] you will have the ultimate victory and
[31:44] so what does she do
[31:45] and then she takes a tent spike and she
[31:47] drives it through his temples into the
[31:49] ground
[31:49] what's she just doing she's destroying
[31:51] that old wicked mind of the enemy
[31:54] amen that old serpent mind that comes in
[31:57] and through his wisdom
[31:58] he'd be in his septility he begins to
[32:00] seduce the bride
[32:01] and now here this gentile woman under
[32:04] the eagle anointing
[32:05] under in the fourth chapter under the
[32:07] fourth judge under deborah
[32:09] now this woman takes and drives a spike
[32:11] right through the
[32:12] enemy's mind said i won't take your
[32:16] thinking anymore
[32:18] it's the mind of christ it's the word or
[32:20] nothing
[32:24] we can go through the bible and go
[32:26] through the bible and go through the
[32:28] bible we come to abraham abraham's bride
[32:31] has to come from his father
[32:36] where does christ's bride come from same
[32:39] place
[32:40] they had to come from the same father
[32:42] out of the same
[32:43] amen out of the same loins comes the
[32:45] bridegroom
[32:46] and the bride and then
[32:50] he wants to have a son so he takes
[32:52] eliezer his servant
[32:54] and now he sends his servant back to the
[32:56] homeland amen to fetch a son
[32:58] because it's got to come from the same
[33:01] lineage
[33:01] the son the wife for the promised son
[33:04] has to come from the same
[33:06] source
[33:09] hallelujah so now brother ben tells us
[33:12] his ministry is eleazar actually the
[33:14] lord told him his ministry was eleazar
[33:16] and he begins to share he's the eliezer
[33:19] time and he's going to fetch
[33:20] a bride for the promised sign amen but
[33:23] as he goes
[33:24] and he goes back amen back into the land
[33:26] back into the denominations
[33:28] and now he's looking to fetch out a
[33:30] bride and bring her out to separation
[33:32] where isaac is
[33:33] because isaac has been put out of the
[33:35] seventh church age
[33:37] isaac is without the camp so he's got to
[33:39] go into the camp
[33:41] amen and he's got to find the woman and
[33:42] he's got to bring her out of the camp to
[33:44] be united with isaac
[33:48] so what's he do he goes in there and
[33:50] he's not going to find the woman by
[33:52] intellectualism he's not going to find
[33:54] her by questionnaires
[33:55] he's not going to find her by going to
[33:57] the authorities he is
[33:59] only going to be able to locate her by
[34:01] revelation
[34:03] and he says lord amen the one that you
[34:06] choose
[34:07] let her give me water and also water my
[34:10] camels
[34:12] the ten camels that he brought and
[34:14] brother branham says
[34:15] that's the beast that's the power that
[34:17] will pack her all the way
[34:18] to her isaac
[34:22] that's the word that's the message
[34:24] that'll carry you all the way to eisen
[34:27] and so eleazar comes along amen
[34:30] and he comes to the well amen it's
[34:33] amazing that there's always a meeting
[34:35] where the water is
[34:37] the water of the washing of the water of
[34:40] the word
[34:41] the water of life coming from the throne
[34:43] of god there's always a meeting taking
[34:45] place by the water
[34:48] eliezer comes and said lord i don't know
[34:51] who she is
[34:53] i don't know what she looks like brother
[34:56] branham couldn't come into a crowd
[34:57] and he couldn't say you and you and you
[35:00] and you you're all the bride come with
[35:02] me i've got something to tell you
[35:03] he didn't know what they looked like but
[35:06] he said let
[35:06] the one amen that waters me and the one
[35:10] that waters my camels
[35:12] let her be your chosen one
[35:15] let the one that will do reference to me
[35:17] and one that will reverence the word the
[35:19] power that'll pack her back
[35:21] to isaac let that be the one
[35:24] and so now rebecca the virgin she comes
[35:27] along
[35:28] as a bride she's coming along she
[35:30] doesn't know she's the bride
[35:32] she doesn't know eliezer is here to call
[35:34] a bride for the promised side
[35:35] she has no idea what's happening just
[35:37] one day she's walking along
[35:39] and all of a sudden she hears a voice
[35:41] and then it's a man who's asking for
[35:43] water
[35:44] amen now now she's in the vision now she
[35:47] herself has to catch a revelation of
[35:50] something eliezer cannot tell her
[35:52] directly
[35:53] because he was told not to explain the
[35:55] third pool
[35:57] he comes to the seventh seal he says
[35:59] stop right
[36:00] here now there's a part
[36:03] that she has to play out to prove that
[36:06] she's the bride
[36:07] and the part she has to play out is not
[36:09] the part eliezer will sit down and say
[36:12] now a plus b equals c squared root to
[36:15] this
[36:16] minus this and it'll bring you to this
[36:17] conclusion did you get it do you see it
[36:19] let me go through it again
[36:20] no he'll lay out all the pieces he'll
[36:22] explain what a is he'll explain what b
[36:24] is he'll explain what c
[36:25] is but he can't amen explain
[36:28] the third pull
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:31] because the seventh seal when it was
[36:33] open there was silence in heaven
[36:35] she herself has to catch the revelation
[36:39] he can only identify her
[36:41] by revelation she can only be identified
[36:44] by revelation it's only by
[36:48] revelation
[36:50] [Applause]
[36:53] that's why you can study the message
[36:54] until your brain is fried
[36:58] you can read and read and read and read
[37:00] and read
[37:01] and you can get it lined up you know
[37:03] where i've got
[37:04] i've got 70 quotes on this subject
[37:07] i've read all of them i'll tell you i
[37:09] did a search the other day
[37:10] i was searching on a subject and i found
[37:13] 85 times brother branham
[37:15] used this particular word i was studying
[37:18] i read every eight every one of those 85
[37:22] quotes in detail and at the end of it
[37:25] i knew nothing more than when i started
[37:30] there's something i'm desiring to know
[37:31] from the lord on this subject
[37:33] but it will not come by intellectual
[37:36] research
[37:36] of the message it must come by
[37:39] revelation
[37:41] so by the time i get done with my 85
[37:43] quotes i can't say
[37:45] now i've read everything the prophet
[37:46] said now i must make my conclusion
[37:49] that's the wrong way to read the message
[37:52] they say well i'll take everything he
[37:54] said
[37:54] i'll cipher through everything he said
[37:56] he said this 47 times he said this 12
[37:58] times
[37:59] and he said this last this was later in
[38:00] his ministry i'm going to go with this
[38:02] that's the wrong way to read the message
[38:04] friends
[38:06] you're going to get the cow and the top
[38:08] of the tree eating grass
[38:09] if you do it that's an intellectual way
[38:12] to study the message
[38:14] now there's nothing wrong with it i hit
[38:16] quote searches i read all through them
[38:17] but at the end of the day
[38:18] with no revelation unless something
[38:21] sparks that to life
[38:22] i'm just i'm just as confused at the end
[38:24] of 85
[38:25] quotes as i was at the beginning
[38:29] if anything happened i got a little more
[38:31] twisted up
[38:32] because it'll say something this way
[38:34] here and something this way here
[38:35] and it looks like they contradict one
[38:37] another and then he changes it over here
[38:39] then he goes back to what he said
[38:40] previously
[38:45] god has delivered a message through a
[38:48] man with a seventh grade education
[38:50] so that you can't hit quote shirts quote
[38:52] searches and put it together
[38:53] intellectually
[38:55] the man will misspeak he'll rephrase
[38:58] he'll get the words wrong he'll get the
[38:59] characters and the bible stories wrong
[39:06] all so we cannot intellectualize this
[39:09] message
[39:11] all so that it must be by revelation
[39:18] he's got i read 60 quotes i got a study
[39:20] on it
[39:22] i don't need your study i need
[39:25] revelation
[39:27] i need god to open my eyes so that i can
[39:29] see the big picture
[39:30] if i can see the big picture the little
[39:32] pictures start to make sense
[39:34] but if we start studying the little
[39:36] pictures till we get brain cramps and we
[39:38] don't see it fit into the big picture
[39:39] all we're going to do is get things
[39:40] misplaced
[39:42] and stuck in the wrong spot square pegs
[39:44] and round holes and round pegs and
[39:45] triangles and
[39:46] my goodness it's going to be a mess
[39:48] later on
[39:50] that's why brother said above everything
[39:52] pray for revelation
[39:55] say god just show me your word i mean
[39:58] we're we should be diligent in reading
[40:00] we should be diligent in listening
[40:02] we should read our bibles that's our
[40:04] duty and our honor and respect towards
[40:06] god
[40:07] for what he's given us we should give
[40:08] our lives to it he's given us this
[40:10] message we should devote our whole life
[40:12] to the message
[40:13] but unless he brings revelation all
[40:15] we're going to do
[40:16] is put a whole bunch of words into our
[40:18] mind and we're going to use our own mind
[40:20] to die to decipher them and all we will
[40:22] do is start another denomination
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:27] but what's the cure for denomination
[40:29] revelation
[40:31] lord above all give us revelation
[40:34] so we find the mystery of the bride
[40:36] genesis 1 we find the rhetoric of the
[40:38] bride
[40:39] malachi 4 we find her all the way
[40:41] through
[40:43] so at the end of malachi behold i send
[40:45] you who the bride
[40:47] elijah came for who the bride eliezer
[40:50] came for who
[40:51] the bride and it's amazing brother brown
[40:54] said let this be the crowning of my
[40:55] ministry
[40:57] that i will take the close of the word
[40:59] and dress a bride
[41:02] that i will prepare her for her meeting
[41:04] with her isaac
[41:07] and then eleazar comes to the crowning
[41:12] of his ministry and the crowning of his
[41:16] ministry
[41:17] is when she they're riding and they're
[41:19] coming into the field
[41:21] amen and and now she sees someone afar
[41:24] off and she says who who is that i don't
[41:27] recognize that cloud that
[41:29] mystery ring of cloud in the sky who who
[41:32] is that
[41:32] what is that cloud you said it's seven
[41:35] angels and it's a pyramid and it's a
[41:36] cluster of angels
[41:37] but but who is that and eliezer's
[41:40] crowding is when the lord told him
[41:42] turn it to the right
[41:46] because rebecca tells eleazar who is
[41:48] this coming
[41:49] he says that's my master son that's
[41:52] isaac
[41:53] amen and she jumps down and she covers
[41:55] herself with the veil
[41:57] and then she runs to meet him and you
[41:59] don't hear anything
[42:00] else about eleazar after that eliezer's
[42:03] ministry
[42:04] is finished now the bride and christ
[42:07] have become one
[42:10] and now mother branham in his crowning
[42:12] act he lays out the word
[42:14] amen he does like haggy eye the
[42:15] chamberlain does in the book of esther
[42:17] he prepares esther to meet the king but
[42:19] you remember
[42:20] after esther meets the king and is
[42:23] accepted
[42:24] amen and there's a marriage union
[42:26] haggai's work is
[42:28] done he's never mentioned again in the
[42:30] book of esther
[42:31] his work is finished he came to the
[42:33] crowning of his ministry
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:37] so the crowning of eliezer's ministry
[42:39] was to fetch a bride
[42:40] prepare her along the way bring her into
[42:43] the presence of isaac
[42:44] and then to point out who isaac is
[42:48] and then after he's done that his work's
[42:49] done the bride takes off from there she
[42:51] runs right to him
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:56] hallelujah brother brenham comes
[43:00] and we've got this ring of mystery this
[43:02] cloud
[43:03] this pyramid this cluster of angels all
[43:05] the things that he's talked about
[43:08] but he himself has never identified it
[43:12] he says the cloud and he says you know
[43:15] he talks about the cloud and how it's
[43:17] formed and the vision and the pyramids
[43:18] and the angels and where they came from
[43:20] and the blast
[43:21] he's talking about all of this but he's
[43:23] never yet identified
[43:25] what that cloud is or what that cloud
[43:28] brought or what that cloud represented
[43:31] and then the angel of the lord said turn
[43:33] it to the right
[43:36] and brother brown says it is right
[43:40] he's looking at it right side up he's
[43:42] looking at it like he's holding it right
[43:43] turned through and they said turn it to
[43:45] the right so he turns it to the right
[43:47] and he said right there it was he said
[43:49] it was christ
[43:50] amen hoffman's head of christ amen just
[43:53] right there
[43:54] shrouded and it was the it was the it
[43:56] was the wings of the angels amen
[43:58] making up the ring of clouds making up
[44:00] his hair white as wool
[44:03] and brother said it's our lord up there
[44:07] eliezer's pointing him out
[44:09] at his coming and saying that's our lord
[44:12] up there
[44:13] there he is amen run and be united to
[44:16] him
[44:16] amen not a cloud not an image in the
[44:19] cloud
[44:20] not a picture on the wall amen but
[44:22] christ coming in the fullness of his
[44:24] word
[44:24] now he's here the seals have been open
[44:27] the message has been delivered
[44:28] now run to him
[44:30] [Applause]
[44:32] he points him out and then shortly after
[44:36] that he leaves the scene
[44:42] i don't i don't ever imagine
[44:45] rebecca after she's been united to isaac
[44:49] and been
[44:50] and become his by an invisib by a union
[44:53] a physical union
[44:57] i don't think that she would ever go oh
[44:59] i wish eliezer were here
[45:03] i wish i was still on the journey i wish
[45:06] i was still
[45:07] somewhere between the denominations
[45:10] and meeting christ i still wish i
[45:13] was in the journey somewhere amen you
[45:16] know there were so many times when i had
[45:18] a need
[45:18] and eliezer just had it right there i
[45:20] had a question and he had the answer
[45:23] and i wanted to know something and he
[45:24] was just in the next camel over and
[45:26] when i had a question i would just call
[45:28] over to him and he would answer my
[45:30] question
[45:30] when i was hungry amen he would provide
[45:33] for my needs when a storm came
[45:35] he could just take care of it amen
[45:36] eliezer was taking care of
[45:38] oh i wish i was back there
[45:42] no she had already united with isaac
[45:44] amen and
[45:45] do you think that her appreciation for
[45:47] eliezer ever faded away
[45:51] and where did her revelation of isaac
[45:53] come from
[45:54] eliezer where did her understanding of
[45:57] isaac come from
[45:58] eliezer she appreciated eliezer eleazar
[46:02] was still there
[46:03] amen guiding the bride through the
[46:06] message that he brought
[46:09] but the objective was to unite with
[46:11] isaac
[46:12] that was the objective of eliezer's
[46:14] ministry that was the whole point
[46:16] of the father sending him was to bring a
[46:18] bride back for the son
[46:23] hallelujah i say thank god
[46:29] so we're here in malachi 4. behold i
[46:33] will send you eleazar
[46:38] elijah the prophet who's the you rebecca
[46:43] the bride do you see it
[46:46] do you see it through the whole bible
[46:49] now let's turn over
[46:50] to the first chapter of the new
[46:52] testament we just read the last two
[46:53] verses the old testament
[46:55] which is the prophecy of elijah coming
[46:57] to the bride
[46:59] so it's a prophecy related to the bride
[47:03] all the way at the end in the old
[47:05] testament now we turn
[47:06] to the beginning of the new testament we
[47:10] start in chapter 1 the book of the
[47:11] generation of jesus christ the son of
[47:13] david the son of abraham
[47:15] it's amazing that he mentions the son of
[47:16] david the son of abraham because that
[47:18] includes both covenants
[47:21] he says the son of david now jesus the
[47:23] son of david son of abraham
[47:25] we know that there was many in the
[47:27] lineage in between
[47:28] abraham and jesus but he skips all of
[47:30] those and he hits david because there's
[47:32] a promise
[47:33] that his son shall sit on the throne
[47:35] forever
[47:37] so there's a promise laying in david
[47:39] that applies to jesus christ
[47:40] and he's going to be the son that sits
[47:42] on the throne forever
[47:45] and then there's a promise to abraham
[47:47] thy seed
[47:48] shall inherit the earth and so now it's
[47:51] mentioned jesus christ the son of david
[47:52] the son of abraham
[47:54] so you know this is the one who gathers
[47:57] all of the promises together amen all
[47:59] the covenants are wrapped up in him
[48:01] the promise the david and the promise to
[48:03] abraham verse two
[48:06] abraham begot isaac and isaac begot
[48:08] jacob and jacob begot
[48:09] judas and his brethren and judas begot
[48:11] pharasin
[48:12] and zara of tamar now this is the first
[48:16] woman that's mentioned in the lineage
[48:18] of tamar and pharaohs begot ezram and
[48:21] ezram begot aram and abraham begat
[48:24] amina dab and amina dab begat nayasan
[48:26] and naasan begot salman and salman
[48:29] got boaz of rahab the harlot
[48:33] second woman mentioned and boaz begat
[48:36] obad of ruth
[48:37] the moabitus
[48:41] three gentiles how does the old
[48:43] testament finish
[48:44] with a prophecy to the bride how does
[48:46] the new testament start
[48:48] with the mystery of the gentile bride
[48:51] laying right in the generation of jesus
[48:53] the son of david the son
[48:55] of abraham and right down through we've
[48:57] already got
[48:58] one gentile bride two gentile brides
[49:01] three gentile brides
[49:07] and boazby got o bed of ruth and obed
[49:09] begot jesse and jesse begot david the
[49:11] king
[49:12] and david the king begot solomon of her
[49:15] that had been the
[49:16] wife of urias
[49:19] now i'm studying the scriptures the best
[49:21] i can tell bathsheba she's not mentioned
[49:23] here
[49:24] bathsheba was actually a jew but she was
[49:26] married to uriah the hittite
[49:30] making her hittite because what you're
[49:33] married to
[49:34] is your identification
[49:37] and so now there's a reason it doesn't
[49:40] say
[49:40] bathsheba but her that was married to
[49:43] uriah
[49:44] the hittite so that you would know here
[49:46] is the fourth gentile woman
[49:49] so here we come through the first six
[49:52] verses
[49:56] through the first six seals
[50:00] we come to the fourth woman
[50:06] because the revelation comes in the
[50:07] fourth seal
[50:10] amen at the time of the sixth seal the
[50:13] sixth thousandth year
[50:16] now we have the fourth gentile woman
[50:19] it's the fourth stage of grace
[50:22] [Applause]
[50:23] amen it's the fourth stage in the
[50:25] restoration
[50:26] which will bring us to chapter seven or
[50:29] verse seven and verse seven
[50:30] is in solomon solomon is a type
[50:33] of christ so the sixth brings us to the
[50:37] works of the seventh
[50:38] which is solomon solomon is a type of
[50:41] christ
[50:41] that actually brought israel into their
[50:43] golden age into their millennium
[50:46] a type of the millennium so here we have
[50:49] in the first seven verses of the new
[50:51] testament
[50:52] is already showing us the seven seals
[50:58] you can't make this stuff up and you
[51:01] can't
[51:01] see it without revelation
[51:05] you can explain that to somebody with no
[51:07] revelation like what
[51:09] yeah four women whatever four seven six
[51:11] i don't mean anything
[51:12] but once you've seen the seals open and
[51:14] you recognize what's happened
[51:16] you go back and say it's laying right
[51:18] here at the beginning of the new
[51:20] testament amen there's four gentile
[51:22] women
[51:22] under the fourth gentile woman under the
[51:24] fourth stage of the restoration
[51:26] comes a seed amen and that seed is a
[51:29] type of christ
[51:31] who brought israel into their type of
[51:34] their millennial reign
[51:36] they have peace on every side the prince
[51:37] of peace the son of david the son of god
[51:39] that's solomon's titles
[51:44] hallelujah search the scriptures
[51:48] they are they that testify of me
[51:51] amen because it was in the sixth day
[51:55] that the man was given a woman and why
[51:57] was he given a woman
[51:58] amen why was why was adam given a bride
[52:01] to reproduce himself
[52:05] in the sixth day hallelujah
[52:09] six is the number of man god is working
[52:13] his mystery through man
[52:16] hallelujah amen in the sixth thousandth
[52:20] year
[52:20] since the fall god is working this
[52:22] mystery through man
[52:24] and when this mystery is complete amen
[52:27] she'll bring forth christ
[52:28] upon the earth again and then we'll go
[52:31] into the seventh day the millennium
[52:35] search the scriptures but we can't
[52:38] search the scriptures without revelation
[52:41] we can't search the scriptures without
[52:43] the message
[52:45] all we get is confusion but when the
[52:48] message comes
[52:49] now you can't hardly get through a
[52:51] couple verses in the bible and all of a
[52:53] sudden you've got to get up from he said
[52:55] i cannot believe what i'm seeing
[52:56] either i'm gone completely mad amen or
[52:59] the spirit
[53:00] of revelation is here unlocking every
[53:02] verse in this bible
[53:04] amen sometimes it's shocking how you'll
[53:06] sit down to read
[53:07] and you just expect to do a daily
[53:08] reading and you're chucking along and
[53:10] get through a couple verses
[53:11] and all of a sudden you hit one and it
[53:12] absolutely explodes
[53:15] what was that amen that's revelation
[53:18] you see something you've never seen
[53:20] before but how did you see it
[53:22] what caused you to see it the revelation
[53:24] of the mystery
[53:25] of the big picture of the seventh seal
[53:28] unlocked every other mystery
[53:32] and god in due time comes and unlocks it
[53:36] praise the lord let's go to john
[53:40] chapter 6. the gospel of john
[53:44] as we move through here
[53:49] praise the lord
[53:55] john chapter 6 and let's look at verse
[53:56] 41.
[54:06] the jews then murmured at him because he
[54:09] said i am the bread which came down from
[54:10] heaven
[54:11] it's amazing how every time the word
[54:14] tells them the truth
[54:16] they deny it they argue about it and
[54:19] they fuss about and here he is
[54:21] the manifestation of the word telling
[54:22] them the truth
[54:24] and they don't like it who doesn't like
[54:28] it
[54:28] here's the question who doesn't like it
[54:30] the harlot the prostitute the tax
[54:32] collector
[54:33] who doesn't like the revealed word
[54:36] of the hour amen portraying the truth of
[54:39] the word
[54:40] who's fighting it it's always the
[54:42] religious leaders
[54:45] who fought every prophet that god sent
[54:47] the religious leaders
[54:48] it's a it's absolutely amazing that now
[54:51] the very
[54:52] ones claiming to proclaim the truth and
[54:54] hold the truth are the very ones
[54:56] fighting the truth
[54:59] says let's go back here verse 41
[55:04] the jews then murmured at him because he
[55:06] said i am the bread which came down from
[55:08] heaven
[55:08] and they said is not this jesus the son
[55:10] of joseph
[55:12] go right back to carnal understanding
[55:16] isn't that william branham wasn't his
[55:18] dad an alcoholic
[55:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:25] that's why that's why dr davis looks at
[55:28] brother branham
[55:29] brother venom says you know the lord
[55:30] told me that i'm going to pray for kings
[55:32] and potentiate
[55:32] amen and he doesn't catch any spiritual
[55:35] revelation at all
[55:36] dr davis looks at this humble young man
[55:39] amen what
[55:40] 20 21 years old got a zeal on fire to
[55:42] preach the gospel
[55:43] come from humble background has nothing
[55:45] in poverty and he looks at him and he
[55:47] says
[55:48] how are you with your seventh grade
[55:50] education what's he doing
[55:51] the same things they did to jesus right
[55:54] here
[55:54] it's the repeat of the scriptures all
[55:56] over again he's looking at brother
[55:58] branham and he's saying
[56:00] you with your seventh grade education
[56:01] you've got no money you've got nothing
[56:03] how are you going to take a ministry to
[56:05] the world a ministry of healing how are
[56:07] you going to pray for kings and pon
[56:08] how are you going to do it and brother
[56:10] branham with the revelation says
[56:12] i don't know how i'm going to do it but
[56:14] he said so
[56:17] if dr davis would have been a spiritual
[56:19] man he would have said i'll pray for you
[56:21] brother
[56:22] i don't see how it's possible but i
[56:24] believe you
[56:27] but he goes right back to carnal amen if
[56:30] there's anything that's limiting us
[56:32] today it's our carnal understanding
[56:34] i say god burn that out of my mind where
[56:37] i think that i can't walk on water i can
[56:39] walk on water
[56:42] the thing that i can't disappear from
[56:44] here and reappear over here amen you
[56:46] don't have to have a glorified body
[56:48] to disappear and show up 100 miles
[56:50] somewhere else philip did it in the same
[56:53] kind of body you have
[56:54] and this message came to restore us back
[56:56] to the faith of the pentecostal
[56:58] fathers that's the faith that philip had
[57:00] it was enough faith to cause him to
[57:02] vanish out of sight
[57:03] and reappear somewhere hundreds of miles
[57:05] away
[57:06] amen that was not in a glorified body
[57:10] that was with nothing different than
[57:12] what you have today
[57:13] he had the full revelation of jesus
[57:15] christ we've received the full
[57:17] revelation of jesus christ
[57:18] there's nothing nothing impossible to
[57:21] them that believes
[57:24] the message come back to bring the full
[57:25] potentials back the full potentials are
[57:28] here
[57:28] your body changes inside of you amen the
[57:31] fullness of the rapture is inside of you
[57:33] everything has come back we're waiting
[57:35] for nothing
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:38] this body oh so many pounds of it i
[57:42] won't tell you how many
[57:44] can walk on top of the water
[57:48] this body amen can vanish and show up
[57:51] somewhere else amen
[57:52] this dirty mouth amen that's been
[57:55] sanctified by the blood of jesus christ
[57:57] can speak squirrels into existence
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:03] hallelujah the only thing that's
[58:05] limiting us is the stuff
[58:06] between our ears that we've come to rely
[58:08] on so much memory and reasoning and
[58:11] affection that we've come to rely our
[58:12] whole existence on
[58:14] that was only here for us to contact
[58:16] this earthly realm that was not given to
[58:18] us to contact the heavenly realm
[58:19] this is the mist this is the vapor
[58:22] that's the reality
[58:23] this is the negative that's the positive
[58:26] i say god help me quit relying on the
[58:28] negative help me quit relying
[58:30] aiming on the mist but help me base my
[58:33] face solidly
[58:34] on that which is real the real is not
[58:38] what's seen the real is what's not seen
[58:40] that's reality
[58:44] hallelujah they all did that with
[58:47] nothing different than what we have
[58:49] right now
[58:55] hallelujah i'm tired of living below my
[58:58] potentials
[58:59] below my privileges we think oh
[59:03] if i lived up to my potential i would be
[59:05] healed of a cold
[59:07] friends if you lived up to your
[59:08] potential your body would change to a
[59:09] glorified body
[59:10] that's the potential that's laying
[59:12] inside you right now
[59:14] you are the bride of jesus christ amen
[59:17] with the full
[59:18] measure of his life that has been
[59:19] restored back
[59:21] what is impossible
[59:24] nothing hallelujah
[59:30] praise god let's get back to our
[59:33] scriptures
[59:35] verse 41 the jews then murmured at him
[59:37] because he said i am the bread which
[59:39] come down from heaven
[59:40] and they said is not this jesus the son
[59:43] of joseph whose father and mother we
[59:45] know
[59:47] you have no idea what you're talking
[59:49] about
[59:52] brother branham said communion i talked
[59:54] about this last week
[59:56] communion service the last service he
[59:57] preached said i realized
[59:59] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[1:00:01] brandon amen
[1:00:04] hallelujah i'm the son of god
[1:00:08] i'm not the son of you fill in the
[1:00:09] blanks for yourself
[1:00:12] i'm the son of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:00:15] hallelujah that's the identity that we
[1:00:17] have to have
[1:00:19] they were just looking at the outward
[1:00:21] and they had no idea who they were
[1:00:22] talking to
[1:00:23] this is not this jesus the son of joseph
[1:00:25] whose father and mother we know
[1:00:28] how is it then that he saith i come down
[1:00:30] from heaven
[1:00:31] here they are they're absolutely
[1:00:34] bamboozled by the words that are coming
[1:00:36] out of his mouth
[1:00:37] because they have zero revelation
[1:00:41] but their intellect was perfectly intact
[1:00:45] there was nothing they weren't deficient
[1:00:47] in mine these were some
[1:00:48] these were some mighty minds of the day
[1:00:50] that were standing here they weren't
[1:00:52] deficient in any way in the mind they
[1:00:54] had no problem they had good vision
[1:00:55] their hearing was fine their bodies were
[1:00:57] sound their mind was sound
[1:00:59] amen but they said what is this
[1:01:02] what is he saying he's come down from
[1:01:04] heaven he's the bread that came down
[1:01:06] from
[1:01:06] how did he come down from heaven he came
[1:01:08] from joseph amen we know his mother and
[1:01:10] father
[1:01:11] amen this is jesus we know all about him
[1:01:13] we saw him as a little kid
[1:01:14] we saw him raise up what
[1:01:18] how can he say he come down from heaven
[1:01:23] hallelujah search the scriptures
[1:01:26] they are they that testify of us friends
[1:01:31] how is it that he saith he come down
[1:01:32] from heaven jesus therefore answered and
[1:01:35] said murmur not amongst yourselves no
[1:01:37] man can come to me except the father
[1:01:38] which has sent me
[1:01:40] draw him and i will raise him up at the
[1:01:42] last day
[1:01:44] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:01:46] they shall be all taught of god
[1:01:49] listen to this they should be taught of
[1:01:52] who
[1:01:56] who taught peter that jesus christ was
[1:01:59] the son of the living god
[1:02:01] my father which is in heaven has
[1:02:03] revealed this to you who taught peter
[1:02:07] amen it was the father god who taught
[1:02:09] peter
[1:02:10] and he says here they they shall be all
[1:02:14] taught of god
[1:02:17] amen revelation is not imparted from one
[1:02:20] man to another
[1:02:21] amen god uses the god uses the gift of
[1:02:24] preaching
[1:02:25] and under preaching he can give
[1:02:27] revelation but preaching itself will not
[1:02:29] impart revelation
[1:02:31] amen preaching is just one gift of god
[1:02:34] breaking the word down and sending it
[1:02:35] out of the people so that god himself
[1:02:37] can take that word and teach it to you
[1:02:39] in your heart
[1:02:41] amen revelation cannot be imparted it
[1:02:44] cannot be caught like a cold amen you
[1:02:46] cannot grow up in the message all your
[1:02:47] life
[1:02:48] and have revelation
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:51] revelation comes from god they must all
[1:02:54] be taught of god
[1:02:55] everyone that cometh to me must be drawn
[1:02:58] of the father they must all be taught of
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:02] now that makes the next scripture really
[1:03:04] interesting
[1:03:05] every man therefore that hath hath
[1:03:09] hath heard is that present tense or past
[1:03:12] tense
[1:03:14] half past tense i won't make you answer
[1:03:17] out loud because if you're like me you
[1:03:18] don't know your tenses very well
[1:03:20] grammar is not easy for me
[1:03:24] all right every man therefore that hath
[1:03:27] heard
[1:03:28] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:03:31] unto me
[1:03:33] so when do you learn of the father after
[1:03:35] you come to him
[1:03:36] no before you've come to him
[1:03:39] you must learn from the father when did
[1:03:42] you learn from the father
[1:03:45] maybe when you were with him before the
[1:03:47] foundation of the world
[1:03:48] amen maybe there you learned of the
[1:03:50] father amen you're part
[1:03:52] of the the attributes of god come from
[1:03:55] the mind of god
[1:03:56] and come to the earth and before you can
[1:03:58] ever come to christ you have to
[1:04:00] already have been taught by the father
[1:04:02] and have heard from the father
[1:04:05] when did you hear from him amen when
[1:04:07] when he was decrying
[1:04:09] amen let there be i was there in that
[1:04:12] logos i was there
[1:04:13] i have no conscious memory of it amen i
[1:04:16] can't think about it
[1:04:17] i don't remember it amen but i was there
[1:04:20] not this part of i but down in here
[1:04:23] there's a part of i
[1:04:24] the real me down on the inside not
[1:04:27] you've never seen me
[1:04:29] ever you've only seen the tent that i
[1:04:33] dwell in temporarily but you have not
[1:04:36] seen me
[1:04:36] but the real me was there amen
[1:04:40] and those that come to the father hath
[1:04:41] already heard
[1:04:43] and has already been taught of him
[1:04:48] hallelujah amen
[1:04:53] that's grace brothers and sisters and
[1:04:56] that's revelation
[1:04:57] coming to god's grace
[1:05:02] every man therefore that hath heard
[1:05:05] i love the way this is written and hath
[1:05:08] learned of the father
[1:05:10] cometh to me past tense
[1:05:14] present tense if he hath
[1:05:17] he will if he hath learned
[1:05:21] he will come praise god
[1:05:26] why are you here why do you believe the
[1:05:28] message not because anybody explained
[1:05:30] anything to you
[1:05:32] not because anybody taught anything not
[1:05:33] because you have a great intellect not
[1:05:35] because of your thesaurus and not
[1:05:36] because of your
[1:05:37] your greek lexicon that's not why you're
[1:05:39] here believing the message
[1:05:41] you're here because something in you
[1:05:43] already knew it was true
[1:05:45] and when the word came the word came to
[1:05:48] quicken the word
[1:05:49] the word came to the word the life came
[1:05:51] to the life the word was already there
[1:05:53] the life was already there
[1:05:54] the seed was already there so the seed
[1:05:56] word comes to the seed
[1:05:58] the life comes to the life the word
[1:06:00] comes to the word to quicken it to life
[1:06:02] because it's already in the seed
[1:06:10] simple if you have revelation
[1:06:14] super complicated if you're trying to
[1:06:15] figure it out
[1:06:22] not that any man hath seen the father
[1:06:24] save he which is of god he hath seen the
[1:06:26] father
[1:06:28] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:06:29] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[1:06:32] hath or will have
[1:06:35] he that believeth on me hath present
[1:06:39] tense
[1:06:40] or past tense past tense
[1:06:43] and it's everlasting life so it's all
[1:06:44] tenses
[1:06:46] past present and future
[1:06:52] i am that bread of life your fathers did
[1:06:55] eat man in the wilderness and
[1:06:57] are dead this is the bread which cometh
[1:07:00] down from heaven
[1:07:01] that a man may eat thereof and not die
[1:07:05] i am the living bread which come down
[1:07:07] from heaven if any man eat of this bread
[1:07:10] he shall live forever and the bread that
[1:07:11] i will give is my flesh which i will
[1:07:13] give
[1:07:14] for the life of the world the jews
[1:07:17] therefore strove among themselves saying
[1:07:18] how can this man give us his flesh to
[1:07:20] eat
[1:07:21] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:07:23] i say to you except you eat the flesh of
[1:07:25] the son of man and drink his blood you
[1:07:26] have no life in you
[1:07:28] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:07:30] blood hath eternal life
[1:07:31] half eternal life
[1:07:34] so if you have eternal life you'll eat
[1:07:36] and drink
[1:07:38] you'll eat and drink not because you
[1:07:39] figured anything out you'll eat and
[1:07:40] drink because you have eternal life
[1:07:43] what's driving you to eat and drink
[1:07:44] eternal life what eternal life the one
[1:07:47] you already have
[1:07:49] that's right hallelujah when you were
[1:07:51] committing the worst sin you've ever
[1:07:53] committed in your life
[1:07:54] that thing that the devil when you're
[1:07:56] down and weak will flash before your eye
[1:07:58] to try to get you to go into depression
[1:08:00] and feel unworthy that sin that makes
[1:08:02] you shudder when you think about it
[1:08:04] when you were in that sin that eternal
[1:08:06] life was still inside you amen
[1:08:10] and that's the thing that brought you
[1:08:12] out of that sin into the word
[1:08:14] and brought you to him because it was
[1:08:16] already there
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:22] hallelujah
[1:08:25] who so eateth in my flesh verse 54 again
[1:08:27] and drinking my blood hath eternal life
[1:08:29] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:08:31] for my flesh is meat indeed
[1:08:34] and my blood is drink indeed this is
[1:08:37] beautiful
[1:08:38] he's already told he's already told us
[1:08:40] that the bread of life is his flesh that
[1:08:41] he gives
[1:08:42] amen and he says my flesh is meat and
[1:08:45] deed and my blood
[1:08:46] is drink indeed now when he makes this
[1:08:49] statement
[1:08:49] this is kind of an emphatic statement
[1:08:51] he's saying my flesh
[1:08:53] is meat indeed it really is
[1:08:56] and my blood is drink indeed it actually
[1:09:00] is
[1:09:01] and if i would stand here at the pulpit
[1:09:03] and say something like that today
[1:09:04] you would look at me like brother chad
[1:09:07] you've gone off the deep end
[1:09:09] but see brother jesus christ is speaking
[1:09:12] spiritual things
[1:09:16] and in a spiritual realm we have got to
[1:09:19] stop
[1:09:19] living in a natural realm
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:23] amen this this message come to lift us
[1:09:25] out of this natural
[1:09:27] carnal amen central and bring us into
[1:09:30] another position amen where we can
[1:09:32] see amen with spiritual eyes spiritual
[1:09:35] things
[1:09:35] and we can understand with spiritual
[1:09:37] understanding spiritual things
[1:09:39] not comparing natural with natural but
[1:09:41] spiritual was spiritual
[1:09:43] and now in that spirit realm not here on
[1:09:46] earth but in the spirit
[1:09:48] his flesh is meat indeed
[1:09:52] it actually is something you're feasting
[1:09:54] on because you're not feasting on the
[1:09:56] body words of a man you're not feasting
[1:09:58] on the words of a man
[1:09:59] you're feasting on the body word of the
[1:10:01] son of man
[1:10:02] how am i feasting on it not with these
[1:10:05] teeth right here
[1:10:06] amen it's a spiritual feast amen where
[1:10:08] we're eating the lamb
[1:10:10] amen when we're eating the word and
[1:10:12] we're growing by and gaining by
[1:10:13] and drinking his blood which is his life
[1:10:16] amen the blood
[1:10:17] is the token of the life and it's the
[1:10:19] life and the word that we're receiving
[1:10:21] spiritually not physically we don't rip
[1:10:24] pages out of our bible and crumple them
[1:10:26] up and eat them amen
[1:10:27] we don't believe that when we come to
[1:10:28] communion amen that there's
[1:10:30] transcendence the systems
[1:10:33] transition to where we can ring a bell
[1:10:37] and say a prayer and all of a sudden it
[1:10:38] becomes the literal
[1:10:39] body of jesus christ and now you're part
[1:10:41] of him because you've actually eaten him
[1:10:43] no it's not physical it's spiritual
[1:10:47] everything to the gentiles is spiritual
[1:10:50] not
[1:10:51] physical amen we get hung up with jewish
[1:10:53] ideas of physical
[1:10:55] not looking at the spiritual he told us
[1:10:57] you're a holy nation
[1:10:59] you're a royal priesthood that's what
[1:11:01] peter said
[1:11:02] holy nation what is the boundaries of
[1:11:04] our nation
[1:11:07] where are the limits where is the
[1:11:08] headquarters where's the embassy
[1:11:10] amen what flag do we fly it's not a
[1:11:14] natural nation it's a holy nation
[1:11:18] it's spiritual it's not physical
[1:11:21] now he says you are a royal priesthood
[1:11:23] okay where do we light the candles
[1:11:25] what altar do we serve at amen where do
[1:11:27] we do the offerings
[1:11:29] where is we're a royal priesthood where
[1:11:31] do we offer
[1:11:32] it's not physical it's spiritual
[1:11:36] that's why the apostle paul amen he says
[1:11:39] and i believe it's in hebrews he said
[1:11:40] you've not come to the mouth that might
[1:11:42] be touched to burn with fire
[1:11:44] you as we say you have not come to a
[1:11:47] physical mountain that you can touch
[1:11:51] that burned with fire that actually
[1:11:53] burned
[1:11:55] but you have come to mount zion
[1:11:58] now paul is declaring another emphatic
[1:12:00] statement that you have arrived to a
[1:12:02] place
[1:12:04] that you have come to a position and now
[1:12:06] you have come to mount zion
[1:12:09] well where is it where is it on the map
[1:12:10] can i find it amen
[1:12:12] i mean is it like sinai can i go find it
[1:12:15] can i locate it can i find burn marks on
[1:12:17] the top of it
[1:12:19] you have come to mount zion you have
[1:12:21] come
[1:12:22] to the holy city you have come to the
[1:12:24] new jerusalem you have come to the
[1:12:26] innumerable
[1:12:26] company of angels you have come to the
[1:12:28] church of the firstborn you have come to
[1:12:30] the sprinkling of blood to speak better
[1:12:31] things than abel
[1:12:32] you have already come to this position
[1:12:36] it's a physical position in the spirit
[1:12:38] realm
[1:12:39] it's not a physical position in this
[1:12:41] realm
[1:12:42] he says you've come to these things
[1:12:44] already but you can't see them
[1:12:47] with these eyes but yet we've already
[1:12:49] arrived
[1:12:51] we've already come to mount zion we've
[1:12:53] come to the new jerusalem we've come to
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:55] innumerable company of angels we've come
[1:12:56] to the sprinkling of blood that speaketh
[1:12:58] better things
[1:12:59] we've already come but we can't see it
[1:13:04] this is the promise to the gentiles amen
[1:13:07] it's it's not physical
[1:13:12] when jesus christ came to the gentiles
[1:13:15] how did he come
[1:13:18] he come through a prophecy
[1:13:22] that was spoken in isaiah it says thou
[1:13:24] shalt be a light unto the gentiles
[1:13:28] right so the prophecy is christ shall be
[1:13:32] a light unto the gentiles
[1:13:35] simeon confirms the prophecy when he
[1:13:37] takes him into his arms
[1:13:38] when he's eight days old on the eighth
[1:13:39] day simeon confirms the prophecy
[1:13:44] and then when the prophecy is going to
[1:13:46] be fulfilled
[1:13:48] here comes paul walking down the road
[1:13:49] with the message
[1:13:52] what is paul walking down the road with
[1:13:53] the message he's the light
[1:13:55] to the gentiles he's the confirmation of
[1:13:59] the prophecy
[1:14:00] this is the lord coming to the gentiles
[1:14:06] it's not visible friends it's invisible
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:12] hallelujah god
[1:14:15] let's keep reading
[1:14:18] verse 55 my flesh is meet indeed and my
[1:14:21] blood is drinking indeed
[1:14:22] he that eaten my flesh and drinketh my
[1:14:24] blood dwelleth in me
[1:14:25] and i in him as the living father hath
[1:14:29] sent me
[1:14:30] and i live by the father so he that
[1:14:32] eateth me even he shall live by me
[1:14:35] this is that bread which came down from
[1:14:37] heaven not as your fathers did eaten
[1:14:39] manna
[1:14:39] and are dead he that eateth of this
[1:14:42] bread shall live
[1:14:43] forever these things said he in the
[1:14:47] synagogue
[1:14:47] as he taught in capernaum so he was in
[1:14:50] church
[1:14:51] he was teaching in church he wasn't with
[1:14:54] republicans and sinners he was in church
[1:14:58] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:15:00] they heard this said this is a hard
[1:15:02] saying who can hear it
[1:15:04] and i see there comes a rejection
[1:15:08] not from the outside but here comes the
[1:15:11] rejection from the inside
[1:15:20] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[1:15:22] it's only a hard saying with no
[1:15:24] revelation
[1:15:26] once you have revelation that's an easy
[1:15:28] saying
[1:15:29] that's a piece of cake we can sit here 2
[1:15:32] 000 years later
[1:15:33] having the revelation of what this meant
[1:15:34] look back and say that's easy there's
[1:15:36] nothing complicated in that but that day
[1:15:38] that he was speaking it before the
[1:15:40] revelation of it came
[1:15:41] they're standing there and they're
[1:15:42] saying even peter is standing here
[1:15:45] not knowing brother bram says they
[1:15:46] didn't have a clue what brother what
[1:15:48] jesus was talking about
[1:15:49] all of his disciples they're standing
[1:15:51] there and they don't even know what he's
[1:15:52] talking about
[1:15:53] and the other disciple says it's a hard
[1:15:54] saying it's a hard saying because of a
[1:15:56] carnal mind
[1:15:59] that's the only thing that makes the
[1:16:00] scriptures hard
[1:16:02] that's the only thing that makes the
[1:16:04] message hard is a carnal mind
[1:16:09] amen then jesus knew in himself
[1:16:13] that his disciples murmured at it he
[1:16:15] said unto him does this offend you
[1:16:18] what and if you shall see the son of man
[1:16:19] ascend up where he was before
[1:16:23] they just said he came from joseph we
[1:16:24] know his father and mother and now he's
[1:16:26] talking crazy again
[1:16:27] what if you should see the son of man
[1:16:29] ascend up where he was before
[1:16:33] now listen to this it is the spirit that
[1:16:36] quickeneth
[1:16:37] the flesh profiteth nothing he's telling
[1:16:40] you
[1:16:41] quit looking at the flesh
[1:16:44] i'm talking about the spirit
[1:16:48] the flesh prophet nothing the words that
[1:16:50] i speak unto you they are
[1:16:52] spirit and they are life but there are
[1:16:54] some of you that believe not for jesus
[1:16:56] knew from the beginning
[1:16:57] who they were that we believe not and
[1:17:00] who should betray him
[1:17:02] and he said therefore said i unto you
[1:17:04] that no man can come unto me
[1:17:06] except they were given unto him of my
[1:17:08] father
[1:17:09] and from that time many of his disciples
[1:17:11] went back and walked no more with him
[1:17:15] these were his disciples these weren't
[1:17:18] just
[1:17:19] people these were his disciples
[1:17:24] verse 67 then said jesus unto the twelve
[1:17:28] will you also go away then simon peter
[1:17:31] answered him lord to whom shall we go
[1:17:34] amen hallelujah how many of you have
[1:17:36] been there
[1:17:37] in the message amen somebody asked you a
[1:17:40] question somebody starts to show you
[1:17:41] contradictions
[1:17:42] somebody will confuse your mind and
[1:17:44] they'll take the message and twist your
[1:17:46] mind in the knot
[1:17:47] amen and all you can say is where where
[1:17:50] else will we go
[1:17:52] there's no place else to go he says
[1:17:55] peter answered
[1:17:55] lord to whom shall we go thou hast the
[1:17:59] words
[1:17:59] of eternal life and we believe in our
[1:18:02] shore that's a revelation friends
[1:18:07] we believe in our shore not of what you
[1:18:10] meant by
[1:18:10] eating flesh and drinking blood he was
[1:18:12] not sure
[1:18:13] about eating flesh and drinking blood
[1:18:16] that's not what he was sure about
[1:18:17] he was sure about a revelation god gave
[1:18:20] to him that came from the father himself
[1:18:22] and that revelation was we believe and
[1:18:24] are sure that thou art that
[1:18:26] christ the son of the living god
[1:18:30] amen you know what revelation is going
[1:18:32] to hold you when somebody confuses you
[1:18:34] on the message
[1:18:34] or twists you up or tries to make it
[1:18:37] convince you or something else
[1:18:38] it's that same revelation that comes
[1:18:40] from the father where else will we go
[1:18:41] this message is christ it holds the
[1:18:45] words of eternal life
[1:18:46] it is unlocking of the revealing of the
[1:18:48] mysteries it i
[1:18:49] i can't figure it all out but this one
[1:18:51] thing i know and
[1:18:53] am sure of friends that's the key right
[1:18:56] there
[1:18:56] if nothing else get that say god give me
[1:18:59] a revelation where i'm
[1:19:01] sure that this message is christ amen
[1:19:04] a foundation that no matter what said
[1:19:07] amen peter can't run away
[1:19:08] no matter how much his intellect cannot
[1:19:11] interpret or handle
[1:19:12] the things that jesus is saying and do
[1:19:14] you think that it hurt peter
[1:19:16] when he saw all the disciples walking
[1:19:17] away
[1:19:20] you remember at this time peter still
[1:19:23] thought that this was going to be a
[1:19:25] great movement
[1:19:27] peter in his mind he still thought this
[1:19:29] is going to be a massive movement
[1:19:31] amen there's going to be the whole
[1:19:33] nation is going to be converted
[1:19:34] jesus is going to become king and i'm
[1:19:36] going to be his right hand man
[1:19:38] that was still peter he was still
[1:19:41] expecting big things
[1:19:43] more people to come amen more miracles
[1:19:46] more signs more wonders more prestige
[1:19:50] more honor and now
[1:19:54] he starts saying things that don't make
[1:19:56] sense
[1:19:58] he starts saying things that are
[1:20:00] twisting
[1:20:01] even his twelve disciples minds up in
[1:20:03] knots
[1:20:05] and now peter starts seeing the the
[1:20:09] disciples walking away
[1:20:12] but there's something anchored in
[1:20:14] peter's heart
[1:20:16] he hath heard from god
[1:20:19] he hath been taught of the father
[1:20:23] he said thou are christ the son of the
[1:20:26] living god
[1:20:28] he says we believe and are sure
[1:20:33] we believe and are sure that thou art
[1:20:35] that christ
[1:20:37] the son of the living god i want to ask
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:41] what is this message
[1:20:45] christ and we've got to be sure
[1:20:48] that it's christ because we're not sure
[1:20:51] it's christ
[1:20:52] somewhere along the way we're going to
[1:20:53] walk away because something's going to
[1:20:56] be hard to understand
[1:20:57] something's going to be hard to deal
[1:20:59] with there's going to be a separation or
[1:21:01] breaking off
[1:21:01] or a walking away of disciples or some
[1:21:04] words that the prophet said that i
[1:21:06] cannot make sense in my mind
[1:21:08] somewhere along the way there's going to
[1:21:10] come a challenge to faith
[1:21:11] amen and only thing that is going to
[1:21:13] stand that challenge
[1:21:15] is this revelation that i am sure that
[1:21:18] this
[1:21:18] message is nothing else than jesus
[1:21:20] christ returned back to the earth in the
[1:21:22] form of his word
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] i'm sure of it i know it amen i don't
[1:21:29] know a lot of things but i know that's
[1:21:31] true
[1:21:32] and that's the thing that'll keep me in
[1:21:34] the dark days that's the thing that'll
[1:21:35] keep me in the trouble sometimes
[1:21:37] that's the thing that'll keep peter when
[1:21:39] everything peter thought was going to
[1:21:40] happen
[1:21:41] goes in reverse
[1:21:44] but his revelation of who this is cannot
[1:21:47] go in reverse
[1:21:48] because peter didn't get it himself it
[1:21:51] was given to him
[1:21:52] of the father and if it was given of the
[1:21:54] father peter himself
[1:21:56] can't lose it
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:21:59] hallelujah how many of you thankful for
[1:22:01] a revelation from the father
[1:22:04] because you would have lost it a long
[1:22:05] time ago you would have left it when
[1:22:07] your prayers weren't answered when your
[1:22:08] family got sick when there was a death
[1:22:10] of a loved one
[1:22:11] amen when the pastor fell away you would
[1:22:13] have fallen away but there was something
[1:22:15] that didn't come from the intellect
[1:22:17] there was something that came from the
[1:22:18] mind of god
[1:22:19] amen possessed the attributes and
[1:22:21] qualities of god and it was an anchor in
[1:22:23] the soul that had been quickened by a
[1:22:25] revelation from the father
[1:22:26] and you said this is nothing but christ
[1:22:30] you can spit on the message you can spit
[1:22:32] on the messenger you can spit on me
[1:22:33] but it's christ nonetheless
[1:22:37] hallelujah
[1:22:40] we believe and are sure that thou art
[1:22:43] christ the son of the living god
[1:22:47] let's turn to john 17.
[1:22:50] where
[1:22:57] john 17 verse 14.
[1:23:04] in john 17 14 he says i have given them
[1:23:07] thy word
[1:23:09] and the world has hated them because
[1:23:12] they are not
[1:23:13] of the world praise god
[1:23:18] has he given us the word
[1:23:21] it doesn't matter if the world likes us
[1:23:22] or hates us we're not of the world
[1:23:25] who does the word come to those who are
[1:23:27] not of the world
[1:23:29] who does the word come to the bible says
[1:23:31] gods
[1:23:33] is that what the bible says the word
[1:23:35] comes to gods
[1:23:37] gods are not of the world they're from
[1:23:39] another world
[1:23:41] you call them gods whom the word of the
[1:23:43] lord came to
[1:23:44] that's right
[1:23:48] okay he says verse 14 and i have given
[1:23:50] them thy word
[1:23:52] and the word hath hated them the world
[1:23:53] has hated them because they are not
[1:23:55] of the world even as i am not of the
[1:23:58] world
[1:23:59] so however much so that jesus was not of
[1:24:02] the world is the same way his disciples
[1:24:03] are not of the world
[1:24:06] it's the same way you and i are not of
[1:24:07] the world so however jesus was not of
[1:24:09] the world is the same way we're not of
[1:24:11] the world
[1:24:13] explain it i can't but i believe it i
[1:24:16] accept it
[1:24:19] i pray not that thou should has take
[1:24:21] them out of the world
[1:24:22] but thou should has keep them from the
[1:24:24] evil they are not of the world
[1:24:26] even as i am not of the lord he repeats
[1:24:29] it just so that we'll get it
[1:24:31] there none of the world even as i am not
[1:24:34] of the world
[1:24:35] let's go over to first john
[1:24:38] first john chapter 4.
[1:24:50] trying to get to a certain place here so
[1:24:52] bear with me
[1:24:53] we'll just keep laying the word down
[1:24:56] john chapter first john chapter 4
[1:24:59] verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit
[1:25:03] but try the spirits whether they are of
[1:25:05] god
[1:25:06] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:25:08] into the world
[1:25:10] hereby know you the spirit of god the
[1:25:12] spirit of god
[1:25:13] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[1:25:16] christ
[1:25:16] is yes let's go back to english class
[1:25:22] present tense past tense future tense
[1:25:25] present tense it's always a present
[1:25:28] tense god
[1:25:30] jesus christ is come in the flesh is
[1:25:33] of god let's go back every spirit that
[1:25:36] confesses that jesus christ
[1:25:38] is coming the flesh is of god
[1:25:42] and every spirit that confesses not that
[1:25:44] jesus christ
[1:25:45] is come in the flesh is not of god
[1:25:49] simple and this is that spirit of
[1:25:53] antichrist
[1:25:54] where of you have heard that it should
[1:25:55] come and even now
[1:25:57] already is it in the world so if it was
[1:26:00] there in the world then it'd already
[1:26:01] come is it here now
[1:26:03] same spirit
[1:26:07] amen year of god little children and
[1:26:10] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:26:12] that is in you
[1:26:13] than he that is in the world they are
[1:26:16] there of the world therefore speak they
[1:26:18] of the world
[1:26:19] and the world heareth them we are of
[1:26:23] god that means we've come from god
[1:26:27] they come from the world we come from
[1:26:29] god
[1:26:31] we are of god he that knoweth god
[1:26:33] heareth us
[1:26:36] he that is not of god heareth not us
[1:26:39] hereby we know the spirit of truth
[1:26:41] and the spirit of error
[1:26:44] john just makes it simple
[1:26:47] we are of god if they hear us
[1:26:51] they're from god they don't hear us
[1:26:53] they're not of god
[1:26:56] simple
[1:27:00] praise the lord i want to take a few
[1:27:03] more
[1:27:04] minutes and look at something not really
[1:27:06] a diversion but another part of the
[1:27:08] puzzle
[1:27:09] let's go to luke 22.
[1:27:13] luke 22 69. i just want to lay this in
[1:27:15] here today
[1:27:34] jesus is in trial with the high priest
[1:27:38] verse 67 luke 20
[1:27:41] 267 he asked art thou the christ
[1:27:45] tell us and he said unto them if i tell
[1:27:47] you you will not believe
[1:27:49] he's already told them tons of stuff and
[1:27:51] they don't believe anything he ever says
[1:27:52] anyhow
[1:27:53] so i answer the questions now
[1:27:56] and if i also ask you you will not
[1:27:58] answer me nor let me go
[1:28:01] hereafter shall the son of man sit on
[1:28:03] the right hand of the power
[1:28:05] of god this is what i want to talk about
[1:28:08] the right hand
[1:28:09] of god let's go back to mark let's turn
[1:28:14] back to mark
[1:28:15] verse 14 and pick this up again
[1:28:27] 14 62
[1:28:30] mark 14 62 and jesus said
[1:28:35] i am and you shall see the son of man
[1:28:37] sitting on the right hand of power and
[1:28:39] coming in the clouds of
[1:28:40] of heaven amen
[1:28:44] we're going to get into this this later
[1:28:45] but i just want to lay this down
[1:28:47] and i want to read this quote from
[1:28:50] questions and answers from
[1:28:52] august 23 of 1964. brother brahm is
[1:28:55] saying
[1:28:56] when when was when man was made in the
[1:28:59] image of god and then god come down in
[1:29:01] the image of man to redeem man
[1:29:03] that brought man and god together
[1:29:04] heavens and earth hugged and kissed each
[1:29:06] other
[1:29:06] god and man embraced each other as
[1:29:08] fatherhood and sonship
[1:29:10] when the logos became flesh and dwelt
[1:29:12] among us jesus said i come from god and
[1:29:15] i go to god is that right
[1:29:16] after his death burial resurrection and
[1:29:19] ascension when the body was taken up to
[1:29:21] set at the right hand of god
[1:29:23] now now brother brennan's going to talk
[1:29:25] about this body sitting at the right
[1:29:27] hand of god
[1:29:28] now listen to what he says now i don't
[1:29:31] mean god's got a right hand
[1:29:34] god's a spirit
[1:29:38] but at the right hand means in power
[1:29:42] and authority of god that in that name
[1:29:46] everything in heaven is named after it
[1:29:48] and subject to it everything in earth is
[1:29:50] named after and subject to it
[1:29:51] a name above names jesus christ so
[1:29:54] brother branham is telling us
[1:29:56] this is not a geographical position
[1:30:00] the sitting at the right hand the
[1:30:01] scripture says sitting at the right hand
[1:30:04] standing at the right hand on the right
[1:30:06] hand it's all those terminologies are
[1:30:08] all the same thing
[1:30:09] amen god is a spirit he doesn't have
[1:30:12] hands
[1:30:14] well the prophet said it's not that
[1:30:16] jesus christ
[1:30:18] amen has to sit on his hand or stand
[1:30:21] beside his hand
[1:30:22] amen it's a position of power and
[1:30:24] authority
[1:30:25] it's a position not a geographical
[1:30:28] location
[1:30:30] because some people think that he must
[1:30:31] stay at the right hand till a certain
[1:30:33] time to also fulfill
[1:30:34] and then he'll leave the right hand and
[1:30:36] come down he will never
[1:30:37] again leave the right hand of god
[1:30:40] because he will never lose his power and
[1:30:42] authority
[1:30:42] when he comes to earth and his body
[1:30:44] again to set up the kingdom of david and
[1:30:46] begins to rule and reign on earth for a
[1:30:48] thousand years
[1:30:49] he is still on the right hand of god
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:53] he cannot leave the right hand of god
[1:30:56] because when he come down as a man and a
[1:30:58] body
[1:30:58] and he conquered death hell in the grave
[1:31:00] and took the keys and ascended on high
[1:31:02] he come into that position of power and
[1:31:06] authority
[1:31:06] and he will never leave that position
[1:31:10] no matter where that body goes we have
[1:31:16] to stop
[1:31:17] thinking with carnal minds and making
[1:31:20] heaven like earth where something has to
[1:31:21] sit here and it's there and on the right
[1:31:23] hand
[1:31:24] it's a position of power and authority
[1:31:28] when jesus christ the same body that was
[1:31:30] nailed to the cross
[1:31:31] comes back to earth in the millennium is
[1:31:34] it here as son of david
[1:31:35] he is still in the right hand of god
[1:31:43] hallelujah believe the prophet
[1:31:47] believe the word first peter 3 22 says
[1:31:51] who has gone into heaven
[1:31:54] and is on the right hand of god
[1:31:57] angels and authorities and powers being
[1:31:59] made subject unto him
[1:32:01] see every time it's referring to the
[1:32:02] right hand it's referring to power
[1:32:05] authority to to his position
[1:32:10] let's go to revelation chapter 4.
[1:32:18] now we know that revelation is a book of
[1:32:19] symbols
[1:32:21] and we want to take a look here just as
[1:32:23] we wind down this morning
[1:32:27] revelations chapter 4
[1:32:32] verse 1 after this i looked and behold a
[1:32:35] door was opened in heaven and the first
[1:32:37] voice which i heard was as it were of a
[1:32:38] trumpet talking with me
[1:32:40] which said come up hither and i will
[1:32:42] show thee things which must be hereafter
[1:32:44] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[1:32:46] behold a throne was set in heaven
[1:32:48] and one sat on the throne
[1:32:51] now where where is jesus
[1:32:57] yeah where where is the nail pierced
[1:32:59] body where's
[1:33:00] he's on the right hand so he's got to be
[1:33:02] in physical position to the right side
[1:33:05] so i've got to see like maybe a shekinah
[1:33:07] glory of god or something and then to
[1:33:09] the right of that i've got to see the
[1:33:10] earth body
[1:33:11] that's not what john saw when he looked
[1:33:15] and he looked all over for a man
[1:33:21] and the cry goes out a christ says
[1:33:24] who is able to come and take the book
[1:33:26] and loose the seals and john looks
[1:33:28] amen brother branham said he looks all
[1:33:29] around and he can't find a man who's
[1:33:31] worthy
[1:33:32] where's jesus at amen where's the man
[1:33:34] who died amen brother bam said he's back
[1:33:36] in behind the throne
[1:33:38] doing the mediatorial work of the high
[1:33:40] priest office what do you mean he's
[1:33:41] behind the throne
[1:33:42] i mean the bible says he's at the right
[1:33:44] hand
[1:33:48] he can be at the right hand and behind
[1:33:49] the throne he can be at the right hand
[1:33:52] and on the throne of david in the
[1:33:53] millennium the right hand is a position
[1:33:55] of power and authority
[1:33:57] not a physical location
[1:34:02] if not the bible means nothing
[1:34:05] or john had a false vision
[1:34:09] hallelujah praise be to god
[1:34:13] so the right hand is power
[1:34:16] and authority
[1:34:20] let's go back to revelation chapter 1
[1:34:23] real quickly i'm going to skip ahead
[1:34:25] just a minute
[1:34:29] revelation chapter 1 verse this is the
[1:34:33] this is jesus john has seen jesus he's
[1:34:36] seen him in the midst of the seven
[1:34:37] golden candle sticks and he's got
[1:34:39] the stars in his right hand he said the
[1:34:41] mystery of the seven stars was thou saws
[1:34:43] in my right hand
[1:34:45] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[1:34:47] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[1:34:49] churches
[1:34:50] and the salmon candlesticks which thou
[1:34:52] sawest are seven churches
[1:34:55] so the seven stars are the angels to the
[1:34:57] churches are the church age messengers
[1:35:00] where are the church age messengers in
[1:35:02] the right hand of jesus
[1:35:04] where's jesus and the right hand of god
[1:35:07] so when john
[1:35:08] looks up and sees the throne why doesn't
[1:35:10] he see jesus
[1:35:11] standing on the right hand and in the
[1:35:13] right hand
[1:35:14] seven angels
[1:35:18] it's symbology jesus has become
[1:35:22] the right hand of god and the right hand
[1:35:25] of christ on earth of the church ages
[1:35:27] is those seven church age messengers
[1:35:29] they have the power
[1:35:30] and authority of god
[1:35:33] this is not physical locations this is
[1:35:36] spiritual positions
[1:35:41] we've got to quit being denominational
[1:35:43] believers
[1:35:45] quit being baptist reading the book of
[1:35:47] revelations and be message believers
[1:35:49] [Applause]
[1:35:52] now let's turn over back to revelations
[1:35:56] 4.
[1:36:01] revelations 4 verse 5. and out of the
[1:36:03] throne this is the same scene you just
[1:36:04] saw
[1:36:05] and out of the throne preceded
[1:36:06] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:36:08] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:36:09] burning before the throne which are the
[1:36:11] seven spirits of god
[1:36:14] i thought god had one spirit brother
[1:36:17] brennan said
[1:36:18] this is one holy spirit
[1:36:22] working in seven different church ages
[1:36:27] but the bible says seven spirits of god
[1:36:32] where are they at before the throne what
[1:36:35] are they
[1:36:36] it's the holy ghost that was working in
[1:36:38] those angels where are the angels and
[1:36:40] the right hand of jesus christ where's
[1:36:41] jesus christ and the right hand of god
[1:36:44] amen you can't paint a picture that
[1:36:46] confusing to make all of that physical
[1:36:50] it's spiritual
[1:36:53] brother-in-law says in the ephesian
[1:36:54] church age out of the church age book
[1:36:56] there he is with the seven stars in his
[1:36:58] right hand the right hand her arm
[1:36:59] signifies the power and authority of god
[1:37:02] psalms 44 3 says for they got they got
[1:37:05] not the land and possession by their own
[1:37:07] sword neither did their own arm save
[1:37:09] them
[1:37:09] but thy right hand in thine arm and the
[1:37:11] light of thy countenance because thou
[1:37:13] hast
[1:37:14] a favor unto them in that right hand of
[1:37:16] power are seven stars
[1:37:18] who according to revelations 1 20 are
[1:37:21] the seven messengers
[1:37:22] this signifies that the very power and
[1:37:24] authority of god are behind these
[1:37:26] messengers to every age
[1:37:27] they they go forth in the fire and power
[1:37:30] of the holy ghost
[1:37:31] with the word he says in the revelation
[1:37:34] of jesus christ out of the same book
[1:37:36] the seven spirits before the throne is
[1:37:38] the spirit
[1:37:40] the spirit that was in each of those
[1:37:42] seven messengers
[1:37:43] giving them their ministry for the age
[1:37:45] in which they lived
[1:37:47] i want to ask you a question
[1:37:50] when the apostle paul was here
[1:37:54] did one of the stars leave jesus's hand
[1:37:59] and come down to earth and did one of
[1:38:01] the seven
[1:38:02] spirits leave the throne
[1:38:06] no friends this earth is only reflecting
[1:38:09] what's going on in heaven
[1:38:12] heaven is not far away heaven is right
[1:38:15] here
[1:38:16] if you travel to heaven how long will it
[1:38:18] take and then what path will you take
[1:38:20] how many miles will you go it's not a
[1:38:23] physical location
[1:38:25] it's another dimension and what's
[1:38:27] happening in this flash
[1:38:28] is only materializing what's going on in
[1:38:31] that dimension
[1:38:32] it's not as though a star leaps and now
[1:38:34] jesus is only holding six stars
[1:38:39] they're always in his right hand
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:43] praise be to god we're not children
[1:38:46] anymore
[1:38:49] praise god let's go back
[1:38:52] to revelation we're in revelation let's
[1:38:54] go to revelation chapter 5.
[1:39:00] and i saw on the right hand huh
[1:39:06] i saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:39:08] on the throne
[1:39:09] a book written within and on the back
[1:39:11] side and sealed
[1:39:13] with seven seals i thought jesus was on
[1:39:17] the right hand
[1:39:20] i thought the stars were in the right
[1:39:22] hand
[1:39:24] here there's a book in the right hand
[1:39:26] side
[1:39:28] the right hand signifies authority and
[1:39:32] power now let's go all the way back to
[1:39:36] genesis chapter 1.
[1:39:38] in genesis chapter 1 when god said let
[1:39:40] us make man in our image male and female
[1:39:42] he made thee them
[1:39:43] and he gave them dominion and said he
[1:39:45] said subdue and have dominion over the
[1:39:47] earth
[1:39:49] what were they they were the power and
[1:39:52] authority
[1:39:53] upon the earth but when they lost that
[1:39:56] position by sin
[1:39:58] the title deed to redemption was taken
[1:40:01] amen and it went
[1:40:02] back where to the right hand of god
[1:40:06] because what is this what is this title
[1:40:08] deed represents
[1:40:09] it represents the power and authority of
[1:40:12] god
[1:40:12] to rule and reign on the earth and that
[1:40:15] power and authority
[1:40:16] is coming back to mankind through the
[1:40:19] bride
[1:40:20] and the bridegroom amen the bridegroom
[1:40:22] purchased it back
[1:40:23] the bride now is finishing her part in
[1:40:25] the plan of redemption
[1:40:26] coming back to full word with no no no
[1:40:30] no no failing
[1:40:33] no no subtility
[1:40:36] no deception no compromise
[1:40:40] no changing the word she's coming back
[1:40:42] to fulfill her part
[1:40:44] and when she finishes fulfilling her
[1:40:45] part standing true on every word
[1:40:47] and then what's happened the the the
[1:40:49] seven seal book opened up
[1:40:51] showing where the power and authority to
[1:40:54] rule the earth
[1:40:54] lays it lays in christ and his bride
[1:40:58] they are joint heirs he that overcometh
[1:41:00] and laodicea shall sit with me in my
[1:41:02] throat even as i have overcome and sit
[1:41:04] with my father

[1:41:09] in the right hand
[1:41:10] signifying where you and i belong
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:17] brother ben says in the rising of the
[1:41:18] sun look what we've seen this day the
[1:41:20] quickening power has come to us to open
[1:41:22] the seven seals
[1:41:23] that's the book that's in his hand to
[1:41:26] open the seven seals what was that the
[1:41:27] intelligence of a man
[1:41:29] no the quickening power of god see the
[1:41:32] quickening power of god foretold this
[1:41:34] would take place see
[1:41:35] the quickening power of god made the
[1:41:36] world testify to it

[1:46:27] in him before the foundation of the
[1:46:30] world
[1:46:30] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:46:32] before him in love

[1:47:12] where have we been quickened to the
[1:47:14] right hand of
[1:47:15] god
[1:47:18] spiritual amnesia is keeping us from
[1:47:20] that
[1:47:22] romans 8 16 says the spirit itself
[1:47:24] beareth witness with our spirit
[1:47:26] that we are the children of god and if
[1:47:28] children then
[1:47:29] heirs heirs of god and joint heirs
[1:47:33] with christ if so be that we suffer with
[1:47:36] him that we may be also glorified
[1:47:38] together what's our position the right
[1:47:41] hand

[1:48:01] of the bride of christ now your name is
[1:48:04] now in the new book not the book of life
[1:48:06] but the lamb's book of life
[1:48:08] what the lamb redeemed not the old book
[1:48:10] of your natural union but your new bride
[1:48:12] hallelujah your new life is in the
[1:48:13] lamb's book of life
[1:48:15] your marriage certificate

[1:48:21] from the beginning takes hold
[1:48:24] so in the right hand that him that sat
[1:48:26] on the throne
[1:48:27] in the right hand was what the seven
[1:48:30] seal book
[1:48:31] the book of redemption the entire bible
[1:48:33] the record of christ
[1:48:35] the believers are the words in the book
[1:48:38] the marriage circuit
[1:48:42] i don't know about you but when you have
[1:48:44] a marriage certificate you don't just
[1:48:46] put the man's name on the marriage
[1:48:48] certificate
[1:48:49] but in the marriage certificate is the
[1:48:51] two who are becoming one amen
[1:48:53] you put the bride and the bridegroom on
[1:48:56] the marriage certificate
[1:48:57] and this marriage certificate amen was
[1:49:00] completed before the foundation of the
[1:49:02] world when we were chosen
[1:49:03] in him and what is this marriage
[1:49:07] certificate it's the title deed to earth
[1:49:09] it's the right to return with christ and
[1:49:12] rule and reign for a thousand years
[1:49:14] and this title deed book is open the
[1:49:16] mystery's been revealed
[1:49:17] christ himself has brought it down the
[1:49:19] mighty angel revelations 10
[1:49:21] 1 amen and he gave the mysteries to the
[1:49:23] seventh church age messenger and the
[1:49:25] seventh church age messenger gave it to
[1:49:26] his people
[1:49:28] and now what do we have we have the
[1:49:31] title deed
[1:49:32] we have the mystery we have the right to
[1:49:35] be
[1:49:35] kings and priests
[1:49:39] what did it come to do break spiritual
[1:49:41] amnesia
[1:49:43] to let us see who we really are
[1:49:51] brother says in trying to do go to
[1:49:54] service without it being god's will
[1:49:57] i went through and i wanted to see
[1:49:59] christ in the right hand
[1:50:01] seven stars in the right hand seven
[1:50:03] spirits before the throne
[1:50:05] book in the right hand i wanted you to
[1:50:06] see all this
[1:50:08] because i want to come to this
[1:50:11] it says you see a tree struggling to
[1:50:13] live that means there's a tree that
[1:50:15] don't die
[1:50:17] you see a man struggling for life it
[1:50:19] shows that there's a tabernacle waiting
[1:50:20] somewhere that don't die
[1:50:23] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:50:25] we have one already waiting
[1:50:27] the good heavenly father permitted me to
[1:50:29] walk behind the curtain one day and see
[1:50:30] it
[1:50:32] but the man would be on the curtain of
[1:50:33] time and seen that he knows it's true
[1:50:37] he says in the rising of the sun
[1:50:42] or no in the masterpiece 1964 in the
[1:50:44] masterpiece he says so
[1:50:46] we realize that we're in a negative form
[1:50:49] that we're in a negative form and as
[1:50:52] long as there's a negative there has to
[1:50:54] be a positive
[1:50:56] there cannot be a negative without a
[1:50:57] positive c because it's because of the
[1:51:00] positive that makes the negative
[1:51:03] what was martin luther the negative what
[1:51:06] was the positive the star on the right
[1:51:08] hand
[1:51:10] he was reflecting the positive here in
[1:51:13] the negative
[1:51:18] it takes the positive that makes the
[1:51:19] negative like you had a negative picture
[1:51:21] of
[1:51:22] some object there has to be an object
[1:51:24] somewhere
[1:51:25] to strike that light strike that lens or
[1:51:27] there wouldn't be any negative
[1:51:29] so when we see that our life here is in
[1:51:31] the negative knowing that we're in the
[1:51:32] image of some life
[1:51:34] somewhere then we know that there is a
[1:51:37] positive somewhere that the light has
[1:51:38] struck
[1:51:39] and it's reflecting something here on
[1:51:41] earth
[1:51:43] and we are only that reflection the
[1:51:45] genuine object is somewhere
[1:51:48] if that isn't i'm the worst deceived man
[1:51:50] in the world
[1:51:51] i spent my life in vain but i know
[1:51:53] beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's
[1:51:55] there see
[1:51:56] that's why we're here why are we here
[1:51:59] we're just reflecting something
[1:52:01] from over there and that
[1:52:04] life over there is not moving and
[1:52:06] leaving and transcending and
[1:52:08] it's there reflecting here this is
[1:52:11] reflecting what's already there
[1:52:14] hallelujah
[1:52:17] brother branham says it is the rising of
[1:52:19] the sun he's talking about going beyond
[1:52:21] the curtain of time and he says
[1:52:22] one day when i was wearing myself
[1:52:25] i said boy you'd better go ahead if
[1:52:27] you're 50 years old if you're going to
[1:52:29] do anything for the lord you better
[1:52:30] hurry up and do it
[1:52:31] you're getting old see and there that
[1:52:34] morning the quickening power came and
[1:52:36] let me look over the curtain
[1:52:37] and i seen all of you over there
[1:52:42] wait a minute he's talking to a room
[1:52:45] full of living people
[1:52:46] yes sir not dead in the vision when he
[1:52:49] goes over there he's greeted by a woman
[1:52:51] who's passed away was 80. she's a young
[1:52:52] woman he's greeted by his first wife
[1:52:54] hope
[1:52:54] amen but now when he comes to the rising
[1:52:57] of the
[1:52:58] sun he says i went there and i seen all
[1:53:00] of you
[1:53:01] over there they were sitting
[1:53:04] right here in a church but in that
[1:53:06] dimension there's a body
[1:53:08] eternal in the heavens already made
[1:53:12] hallelujah and the life sitting in the
[1:53:14] sea is only reflecting the life that's
[1:53:16] over there
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:22] jesus says in john 3 13. said no man
[1:53:26] hath ascended up to heaven but he that
[1:53:28] cometh down from heaven
[1:53:30] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:53:34] he's here and he's there you're here in
[1:53:37] there
[1:53:39] is that shocking that's what brother
[1:53:40] branham said
[1:53:42] the scripture says if these bodies of
[1:53:43] our earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:53:45] have one already eternal in the heavens
[1:53:48] it's there already amen i'm here and
[1:53:51] there
[1:53:52] at the same time now how long does it
[1:53:55] take to get from here to there

[1:56:31] bible school student
[1:56:33] i want to be a believer i want to be
[1:56:36] just as much believers peter was
[1:56:38] ignorant and unlearned couldn't sign his

[1:56:44] theologians could catch
[1:56:47] i i want to be a man like simple hattie
[1:56:50] wright

[1:56:59] revelation to say this
[1:57:00] is nothing but the truth
[1:57:04] pray god i want to read my bible with
[1:57:06] spiritual eyes
[1:57:07] i want to be in my bible with the eyes
[1:57:09] of understanding being enlightened amen
[1:57:11] not the old carnal way of we used to do
[1:57:13] it amen we used to just take it these
[1:57:15] are english words and they mean that
[1:57:17] my goodness they've been arguing over
[1:57:19] that for thousands of years let them
[1:57:21] keep arguing
[1:57:22] but the eyes of understanding having
[1:57:24] been open now we go back to the same
[1:57:26] scriptures we've read dozens of times
[1:57:28] and now the sudden we look and say
[1:57:29] that's me that's me
[1:57:32] that's me that's me that's me
[1:57:35] i can see the mystery through the entire
[1:57:37] bible and i couldn't see it before
[1:57:39] did the words change the words didn't
[1:57:41] change i changed
[1:57:45] say god changed me let me see this
[1:57:47] message for what it really is
[1:57:50] god bless your saints let's stand
[1:57:53] hallelujah we love you
[1:57:57] the love of the lord we praise his holy
[1:57:59] name for being so good to us
[1:58:02] you know how many prophets and wise men
[1:58:04] would have loved to see this day
[1:58:07] you know how many would have loved to
[1:58:08] have been here in this day
[1:58:10] you know you know how they would have
[1:58:12] longed to hear a sermon preach like this
[1:58:17] but it's this day it's the day that we
[1:58:20] live in
[1:58:22] that he's expressing all these things to
[1:58:24] us
[1:58:25] we used to think that someday
[1:58:29] i'll fly away to the wild blue yonder
[1:58:32] and i mean
[1:58:33] how long of a trip will it be
[1:58:38] how far is it between heaven and earth
[1:58:42] see those old ideas of above the clouds
[1:58:45] and
[1:58:45] you know past the milky way my goodness
[1:58:49] friends it's another dimension
[1:58:53] it's not even another place really
[1:58:57] brother bam said it's right here
[1:59:00] just moving at a faster speed
[1:59:04] and this life that we're living now is a
[1:59:06] reflection of that one
[1:59:08] that's the positive this is the negative
[1:59:10] the negative is portraying the positive
[1:59:13] but as the positive and the negative get
[1:59:15] closer together
[1:59:18] brother brandon says it's like a shadow
[1:59:20] of your hand
[1:59:21] far away you can start to discern
[1:59:23] fingers five fingers it gets closer
[1:59:25] and you start to recognize the outline
[1:59:27] of a man's hand five fingers you can
[1:59:28] count and you start to see some detail
[1:59:30] but all of a sudden the positive and
[1:59:31] negative come together
[1:59:34] and our bodies change
[1:59:37] and we meet him in the air how high in
[1:59:39] the air where at in the air
[1:59:42] what air
[1:59:45] praise god we just changed dimensions
[1:59:47] friends
[1:59:49] it's just a dimensional change it's a
[1:59:52] mile up no it's half a mile up no
[1:59:53] it's three quarters a month no because
[1:59:55] there's oxygen we don't need oxygen and
[1:59:56] you can start all kinds of arguments
[1:59:58] about how high you're going to go it's a
[2:00:00] dimensional change
[2:00:04] praise god almighty i thank god that
[2:00:07] he's brought us up
[2:00:08] from our childishness and our kitty
[2:00:10] stuff and brought us into a place where
[2:00:12] all things are possible to them
[2:00:16] that believe say god give me a
[2:00:20] revelation
[2:00:21] a greater revelation a revelation like
[2:00:23] i've never had before
[2:00:24] the revelation of the rapture that will
[2:00:26] change my body
[2:00:29] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[2:00:32] you lord for this word
[2:00:34] we just ask god that you just come to us
[2:00:37] lord
[2:00:38] quicken lord more of yourself to us
[2:00:42] lord you've given us life lord your own
[2:00:45] life
[2:00:46] you've opened our eyes of understanding
[2:00:48] that we might see you
[2:00:50] but lord we're not satisfied we must
[2:00:52] have more
[2:00:54] god there's more of you to be had we
[2:00:56] sense it we we
[2:00:57] know it lord there's a greater
[2:00:59] realization lord there's more of the
[2:01:01] positive moving into the negative
[2:01:03] and we're hungry for more lord we're
[2:01:05] hungry to be that manifestation
[2:01:07] that you've called us to be in this day
[2:01:09] we're hungry to live the literal life
[2:01:11] and put it on display
[2:01:13] to be the light of the world let it be
[2:01:16] in us
[2:01:16] lord move all the carnality out of the
[2:01:18] way lord forgive us
[2:01:20] lord for being so earthbound we just
[2:01:23] pray god that you would lift our heads
[2:01:25] above
[2:01:27] all of the cardinal that's going on
[2:01:28] around us lift us into heavenly places
[2:01:31] that we can see our position
[2:01:34] all that we might recognize the day
[2:01:35] we're living and we might recognize
[2:01:37] what's going on all around us
[2:01:39] we might live a different kind of life
[2:01:41] lord
[2:01:43] the kind of life that you lived when you
[2:01:45] were here on earth
[2:01:46] your prophet said you lived a life all
[2:01:48] to yourself
[2:01:50] that's the kind of life we want to live
[2:01:52] lord the
[2:01:53] same life that you lived we god we
[2:01:56] prayed you would grant it
[2:01:58] open your word to us lord let us see it
[2:02:02] god open the eyes of our understanding
[2:02:04] correct us where we've been wrong
[2:02:06] correct our wrong thinking our wrong
[2:02:08] understanding give us your mind lord in
[2:02:10] greater measure than we've ever had it
[2:02:12] before
[2:02:13] and let it change our minds we give
[2:02:16] ourselves to you
[2:02:18] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:23] praise the lord tell your friends
[2:02:28] it's not what we used to think it was
[2:02:32] it's not anything like the denominations
[2:02:35] teach
[2:02:37] it's so different that it took a prophet
[2:02:41] who could go into the back part of god's
[2:02:43] mind who would have
[2:02:45] thus saith the lord on the scriptures
[2:02:48] because we could have
[2:02:49] never figured it out with a carnal mind
[2:02:53] i'm thankful for that
[2:02:56] and we know that when brother brenham
[2:02:58] comes to preach the rapture
[2:03:00] he explains the order of the rapture the
[2:03:03] or
[2:03:03] the rapture comes in an order the shout
[2:03:07] the voice and the trumpet he says he
[2:03:09] does all three
[2:03:10] while he's descending
[2:03:14] descending from where brother branham
[2:03:17] said heaven's right here
[2:03:19] how long does it take to descend i mean
[2:03:22] it's been 50 years since the prophet was
[2:03:24] here so it must be a long ways away
[2:03:27] like if it takes 50 years to come so far
[2:03:30] from shout voice to trumpet he must have
[2:03:33] been a long ways away he's been
[2:03:34] traveling for 50 years
[2:03:38] friends it's not a distance it's not a
[2:03:41] measurement
[2:03:43] he's descending from one dimension into
[2:03:45] another
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:49] through the shout the shout is what the
[2:03:51] message to gather the bride
[2:03:52] through the voice the voice is in the
[2:03:54] bride the same voice that called lazarus
[2:03:56] from the grave
[2:03:59] that voice is a life lived what's he
[2:04:01] doing he's moving dimensions
[2:04:03] he's slipping into this dimension until
[2:04:06] he slips so much that the bodies change
[2:04:10] and we meet him in the air where another
[2:04:12] dimension
[2:04:16] don't think of things far off in long
[2:04:18] ways
[2:04:20] it's here it's happening
[2:04:23] he does all three while he's descending
[2:04:26] he's coming into this dimension
[2:04:28] in what way in you and me
[2:04:33] say thank god for that let me live it
[2:04:36] every day of my life
[2:04:38] let that reality shine forth in this
[2:04:41] dimension
[2:04:42] i pray in jesus name let's sing we'll
[2:04:45] let you be dismissed god bless you
[2:04:47] you have a song let's sing that song
[2:04:51] he's alive
[2:04:54] and well living in me
[2:04:59] to tell the world
[2:05:05] that he is the same
[2:05:12] love he's the same yesterday
[2:05:18] and today and forever
[2:05:24] jesus is alive
[2:05:28] and well
