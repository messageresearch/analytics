========================================

see they had their Nets on the left hand side I want you to it's so simple but it really it thrilled my soul but it's so simple they had their Nets on the left hand side on the left hand side of the boat why did they do that cuz they' always done it that way they'd always done it that way but you see they didn't particularly realize what was going on here they hadn't realized that now we've moved I'm going to draw a dotted line which is going to be the this is time yeah and here is time here now I'm I'm putting this overlapping and here's the cross I'm going to do it in dark here is the cross they haven't realized that we've now moved over into a whole new dispensation okay they have they and and the Lord is now saying remember he's called them to catch fish yeah fishes of men and now they're out fishing but you know on the left hand side well you know we're just going to do as we always did they haven't realize that now we've moved over into this new dispensation of time right and the fish that the Lord has called them to catch wasn't on the left hand side of the boat listen hey it wasn't on the left hand side the fish that he called them to was on the right hand side of the boat amen mate no longer are we supposed to cast The Net into Israel into the left hand side of the boat but the fish that the Lord wants to go with his bread of life is on the right hand side of the boat M that's so simple but hey come on there's a a new dispensation new time changed and they didn't get it they hadn't caught on to it and so the Lord called he doesn't say they're not Christians he says they're immature Christians there's nothing wrong with being immature Christian there's nothing wrong with the youngest kides and just just just just just praising the Lord and just being kids there's nothing wrong with that but there comes a time where we're called to something higher there's a new testament Bride on this hand side of the boat that's got to be caught
