[4:49] amen if you've had a father especially
[4:51] you had a good father

[5:05] you

[5:07] long time but god bless you together
[5:13] and then the gene was really sick with
[5:16] double pneumonia by the effects of
[5:17] cloven 19 and
[5:19] he got pretty low but god miraculously
[5:22] stepped on the scene and healed
[5:24] our brother and we thank god for that so
[5:26] this is a very special day for all of us
[5:28] brother gene god bless you
[5:30] dear lord jesus we thank you god for
[5:32] your goodness to us
[5:34] we thank you for your mercy that you've
[5:35] given to us
[5:37] how you've brought us through every
[5:38] change and every obstacle
[5:40] through all kinds of requirements of man
[5:43] and government mandates and
[5:45] sickness and everything else lord but
[5:47] you've brought us through
[5:49] you have prospered us in the midst of
[5:52] the world's chaos you have prospered us
[5:54] you've grown us in your word you have
[5:56] moved us forward in your program
[5:58] and lord for that we're forever grateful
[6:01] as we come to you today on a father's
[6:03] day lord we cannot
[6:05] be so thankful that you're our father
[6:07] that we know
[6:08] our origin is in you lord we come from
[6:10] you we go to you and that makes father's
[6:12] day even more special
[6:14] to the children of god because we know
[6:15] who our father is
[6:17] we know where we came from lord and we
[6:18] know why we're here
[6:20] and we just want to please you in all
[6:22] things i pray in the preaching of the
[6:24] word now that you would just be pleased
[6:26] and all that said
[6:27] that you would come down yourself by the
[6:29] power of your spirit and speak through
[6:30] these lips lord
[6:32] give your children the daily bread that
[6:33] they seek lord
[6:35] god be glorified and honored as we
[6:37] receive your word
[6:38] take take control in charge of every
[6:40] part of the service have preeminence
[6:42] among us
[6:43] and guide us by your spirit in jesus
[6:46] christ's name we pray amen
[6:49] let's take our bibles and turn to second
[6:50] corinthians if we will
[6:53] i want to continue the thought from
[6:54] wednesday i really never did get into
[6:57] some of my notes in the powerpoint i
[6:59] just i felt to continue on so this would
[7:02] be part two
[7:03] and uh i never did give a title last
[7:05] time but i intended to call it do not
[7:07] fear his voice
[7:08] do not fear his voice and then this will
[7:10] be part two
[7:12] lord willing this morning and i want to
[7:14] say god bless you fathers but i don't
[7:16] have a father's day message
[7:18] i just have to go as the lord leads amen
[7:21] and uh
[7:22] praise god us fathers we're tough we can
[7:24] take it right
[7:25] it's okay but i've never been really
[7:29] super good at preaching on schedule with
[7:31] the holidays and having a christmas
[7:33] message and a thanksgiving
[7:34] sometimes it works out that day it's the
[7:36] way sometimes you get inspiration and
[7:37] it's good and thank god
[7:39] but sometimes all you can do is stay in
[7:41] the vein
[7:42] that that he sent us in amen and that's
[7:45] what we want we want
[7:46] on this father's day we want our father
[7:48] to be in control
[7:50] man let's go with the second corinthians
[7:52] uh chapter three
[7:57] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 12.
[8:03] seeing then that we have such hope we
[8:05] use great plainness of speech
[8:07] and not as moses which put a veil over
[8:10] his face that the children of israel
[8:11] could not steadfastly look to the end
[8:14] of that which is abolished but their
[8:16] minds were blinded for until this day
[8:18] remain at the same veil untaken away
[8:20] in the reading of the old testament
[8:22] which veil is done away in christ
[8:25] but even unto this day when moses is
[8:27] read the veil is upon their heart
[8:29] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[8:30] lord the veil shall be taken away
[8:33] now the lord is that spirit and where
[8:35] the spirit of the lord is there is
[8:36] liberty
[8:37] but we all with open face beholding us
[8:40] in a glass the glory of the lord
[8:42] are changed unto the same image from
[8:44] glory to glory
[8:46] even as by the spirit of the lord amen
[8:48] you may be seated
[8:50] ask the lord to bless the reading of his
[8:52] word
[8:54] is a to me this is just a tremendous
[8:56] passage of scripture
[8:58] and man we we want to we want to look at
[9:00] the fact that
[9:02] moses when he come down off of the
[9:04] mountain he come
[9:05] down and because he had received the
[9:08] word and been in the presence of the
[9:09] shekinah glory of god
[9:11] and now that the word was in moses moses
[9:14] face shone so that the congregation
[9:17] could not
[9:18] look steadfastly on him and he put a
[9:20] veil over his face and so
[9:22] moses brother bam tells us that a
[9:25] prophet
[9:26] becomes the word to the age
[9:29] so they literally it's not it's not just
[9:32] that the prophet brings the word
[9:34] because if we just look at the prophet
[9:36] bringing the word we're going to miss
[9:37] so many things that happens in the life
[9:39] of a prophet because that very prophet
[9:42] himself becomes the word to the age
[9:46] his whole life what happens to him the
[9:48] circumstances surrounding his life
[9:50] amen the events that take place in the
[9:53] sequence of events
[9:54] it becomes the word to that age
[9:57] so that's why when we look at brother
[9:58] branham's life when we start to see
[10:00] the way god leads his life and directs
[10:02] him and the significant
[10:04] events that happen in his life we begin
[10:06] to realize
[10:07] it's all ordained of god and it's all
[10:09] speaking the same thing it's speaking
[10:11] the word to us
[10:12] through the actual events that take
[10:13] place in his life for instance
[10:15] the brother behind stands up to preach
[10:17] birth pains and he's preached preaching
[10:18] birth pains he's preaching the sixth
[10:20] seal
[10:21] the world in travail purging of the
[10:22] world to bring forth the millennium
[10:24] and here he preaches birth pains which
[10:26] is the judgment the time of judgment
[10:29] amend the sixth seal and and his bible
[10:32] sticks together the pages in his bible
[10:34] sticks together
[10:35] so that he can't find the scripture he's
[10:36] looking for so that a catholic priest
[10:39] will step forward
[10:40] with the scroll in his hand because
[10:41] we're now replaying a scene that played
[10:44] out
[10:44] when jesus christ was here on earth then
[10:46] he gives him a bible
[10:47] and brother rem said it was a new bible
[10:49] that my that my wife bought me for
[10:51] christmas i mean as normal as normal can
[10:54] be
[10:54] she bought him a bible in the new bible
[10:57] sometimes the pages will stick together
[10:59] amen and they were stuck together it was
[11:01] just a normal event in the life of the
[11:04] prophet
[11:04] amen but there's no normal event in the
[11:07] life of a prophet because his life
[11:09] becomes the word to the people so the
[11:12] very actions he takes the very things
[11:14] that happened to him
[11:15] so now moses is becoming the word to the
[11:17] people
[11:18] because moses has the word amen and
[11:20] because they refused to go
[11:22] up into that mountain when god called
[11:24] for them and he spoke to them
[11:26] now they cannot endure the word and the
[11:29] word has to be veiled from them
[11:32] because god wanted to give his word
[11:34] directly to them because he wanted to be
[11:36] married to them
[11:37] amen and they refused to have that kind
[11:39] of relationship with god
[11:41] and now they ask moses to go up moses
[11:44] goes up
[11:44] and the illumination of the word is so
[11:47] great that moses face shines because
[11:49] out from his face out from his mouth is
[11:51] going to come the word
[11:52] and he puts a veil on it showing that
[11:55] the word now has to be veiled to the
[11:57] people who refuse to go to the light
[12:01] and showing that the same thing is true
[12:03] now that the word is veiled but it's
[12:05] veiled behind badger skins
[12:08] it's veiled behind people it was veiled
[12:10] in brother branham
[12:11] and he may not have had to put a veil
[12:13] over his face
[12:14] because we by this time we've already
[12:16] caught the concept that thou the word
[12:18] the light now is going to shine through
[12:20] human beings
[12:21] and now it's in the veil of human flesh
[12:24] and now the the
[12:25] now the word is veiled in the prophet
[12:28] praise be to god and when we refuse
[12:32] when we refuse to go up the mountain to
[12:34] the light ourselves
[12:36] then there's a veil that's put over our
[12:38] heart
[12:39] because now it's not the physical of a
[12:42] shining of a face
[12:43] and a physical veil but it's spiritual
[12:46] and now that the word is veiled in human
[12:48] flesh
[12:48] it's coming through a messenger amen but
[12:51] now our heart is veiled because we
[12:53] cannot endure the light
[12:54] unless we allow the spirit of god to rip
[12:56] the veil and we with an open face or
[12:59] unveiled face are beholding him face to
[13:02] face
[13:04] and being changed from glory and to
[13:06] glory and to the image of what we're
[13:09] seeing
[13:10] but if we refuse amen to go further in
[13:13] the light
[13:14] then we have a veil over our hearts so
[13:17] because they refused the veil was put
[13:19] over their heart
[13:20] paul the apostle paul says even to this
[13:22] day the veil
[13:23] when the under the reading of moses the
[13:25] veil is on their heart
[13:26] so even even though they were reading
[13:29] the right words
[13:32] the veil was on the heart because they
[13:35] refused
[13:37] this is so important because if we place
[13:39] this back there we miss the whole point
[13:42] because all the word is written for
[13:45] today
[13:46] the whole bible all the word is written
[13:48] for today all this was done for our
[13:51] example so that we will know
[13:52] amen so everything is written for this
[13:55] day this is the end time the last day
[13:57] and all the bible is here to unfold
[13:59] itself in this day
[14:01] and we have to make sure that we don't
[14:03] repeat the same mistake that was
[14:04] repeated back there
[14:08] so let's go to exodus this in a way of
[14:10] review
[14:11] let's look at this in exodus
[14:14] 19. and i just pray to god that i can
[14:19] just express
[14:21] clearly what's on my heart i've never
[14:24] once felt like i've expressed clearly
[14:26] what's on my heart
[14:27] but i keep praying for it but i know
[14:30] that
[14:30] god can express it in your heart
[14:33] correctly
[14:34] because there's a there's a mechanism of
[14:37] human flesh that is so flawed
[14:39] it can never be perfect it can just
[14:42] never be perfect
[14:43] so between the perfect word coming in a
[14:45] perfect revelation and the perfect
[14:47] revelation striking your heart
[14:49] god will allow it to get all jumbled up
[14:51] in human flesh so that only the
[14:52] supernatural can take place in your
[14:54] heart
[14:55] and if it wasn't for that it wouldn't be
[14:57] supernatural it would be by good
[14:59] teaching
[15:00] amen and good teaching would be able to
[15:02] part revelation
[15:03] and then you would be able to be born
[15:05] again just by sitting under the right
[15:06] teacher
[15:08] now there's a truth to that because the
[15:10] right word will bring a birth but it's
[15:11] got to be
[15:12] jumbled up in humanity where it can
[15:14] never
[15:15] be perfect
[15:19] it can all it always has to come amen so
[15:21] through something that's flawed
[15:23] so that there still has to be a
[15:25] supernatural work that only god can do
[15:27] to bring the perfect revelation in your
[15:28] heart
[15:31] and so i'll just give up on trying to do
[15:33] it perfect amen
[15:35] i'm just going to do as the lord leads
[15:36] praise be to god
[15:38] exodus 19 and 10.
[15:43] exodus 19 and 10 and the lord said unto
[15:46] moses go into the people and sanctify
[15:48] them today and tomorrow and let them
[15:49] wash their clothes
[15:50] and be ready against the third day for
[15:52] the third day the lord will come down in
[15:54] the sight of all the people upon mount
[15:56] sinai
[15:58] and thou shalt set bounds unto the
[16:00] people
[16:01] round about saying take heed to
[16:02] yourselves that you go not up into the
[16:04] mount or touch the border of it
[16:06] whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
[16:08] surely put to death
[16:10] there shall not be a hand toucheth but
[16:12] he shall surely be stoned
[16:13] or shot through whether it be beast or
[16:16] man it shall not live
[16:17] when the trumpet soundeth long they
[16:19] shall come up
[16:21] to the mountain so so we've got a
[16:23] situation here
[16:25] where where he says prepare yourselves
[16:28] into the third day
[16:29] but in the third day i'm going to come
[16:32] down on cyanide
[16:33] and and put a a border around the
[16:37] mountain
[16:37] and guards there that nothing will touch
[16:39] the mountain unless it
[16:40] it be killed amen but then he says but
[16:43] when the trumpet sound is long come up
[16:45] into the mountain
[16:47] so so you can see
[16:50] you can see
[16:53] how easy it is to misunderstand god
[16:56] because
[16:57] god is saying don't come to this
[16:59] mountain
[17:00] you'll die if you come to this mountain
[17:04] before the trumpet sound line
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:09] but because there was such a fearful
[17:12] because there was such a fearful warning
[17:15] and
[17:15] consequences for coming up this mountain
[17:18] within the three days
[17:19] amen because of that amen there's a
[17:22] natural fear of the mountain that sets
[17:25] in
[17:25] because don't go don't go don't go and
[17:27] it's it's like
[17:29] it's like don't try to touch those seals
[17:31] don't touch those seals don't touch
[17:33] those seals
[17:34] amen because you'll bring death if you
[17:35] try to touch those seals you can't
[17:37] interpret those seals
[17:38] and you can see how there's a natural
[17:40] fear of the mountain
[17:42] amen because we're told don't touch it
[17:43] don't touch it don't interpret it
[17:50] but don't touch it until the trumpets
[17:52] sound
[17:53] long but when the trumpets sound long
[17:56] then you get up here to me
[17:57] that's the time to come and so because
[18:01] man probed at it and probed at it and
[18:03] probed at it and couldn't touch it
[18:05] why because it was a stone cut out of
[18:07] the mountain without hands
[18:08] amen man was not going to be able amen
[18:11] to interpret this stone
[18:13] it was it was cut out without hands god
[18:15] didn't do it
[18:16] through man he's going to bring the
[18:18] interpretation himself
[18:21] and so he says don't do it don't do it
[18:23] don't do it
[18:24] now do it and you can see there's a fear
[18:27] and an angst
[18:28] because they have to tell their children
[18:29] they have to keep their animals back
[18:31] if you even touch it you'll be stoned
[18:32] there are thrust through with the dark
[18:34] don't you
[18:35] dare go try to interpret those seals
[18:37] don't you dare
[18:38] move into the book of revelation amen
[18:40] don't you do that
[18:42] amen and so there's a natural through
[18:44] the church ages is a natural
[18:47] fear of the mountain
[18:52] amen but the jubilee trumpet has sounded
[18:55] amen the lord has come himself to the
[18:57] top of the mountain
[18:58] and the trumpet has sounded long and
[18:59] sounded out the seven thunders
[19:01] and now it's time to go up into the
[19:04] thick darkness
[19:07] and so we could easily repeat the same
[19:10] mistakes as the past
[19:15] in deuteronomy 5 we're going to do this
[19:18] like we did wednesday keep your place
[19:21] here in exodus and go to deuteronomy
[19:24] chapter 5 with me
[19:25] to read this passage of scripture as
[19:27] well
[19:31] deuteronomy 5
[19:34] and 2. the lord
[19:38] the lord our god made a covenant with
[19:40] with us in horeb
[19:42] so you find out that what god was going
[19:45] to do is he was giving them a covenant
[19:47] and it was a marriage covenant
[19:49] he moses had already been up to the
[19:51] mountain god had
[19:52] already set the terms and said if you
[19:54] listen to me
[19:55] and obey me you'll be my people and i'll
[19:58] be a god to you
[19:59] and and he comes down and when he comes
[20:01] down the mountain he tells the people
[20:02] and the people
[20:03] except that uh they they accept the
[20:06] proposal
[20:08] he proposes to him through moses because
[20:10] it's always the friend of the bridegroom
[20:11] it's always a servant that comes
[20:13] amen and he comes and he tells israel
[20:15] this is what god said on the mount
[20:17] and they said we'll do it all we'll do
[20:19] everything we accept the terms of this
[20:22] engagement
[20:22] we now are a spouse to god
[20:25] and then he tells him these next
[20:27] instructions that that stay off the
[20:29] mountain preparing to the third day
[20:31] wash your clothes be sanctified be holy
[20:33] be ready
[20:34] and when the trumpet sound long come up
[20:36] to me and that's where they refused god
[20:39] so they never went into the marriage
[20:41] union
[20:41] they stayed the espoused wife who was
[20:44] put away
[20:44] for the rest of the old testament for
[20:47] the rest of
[20:48] they're still a spouse to god they can't
[20:50] marry to another it's still adultery
[20:51] it's still wrong
[20:52] amen they commit fornication they commit
[20:54] adultery he allows them to get taken by
[20:56] the assyrians he allows them to get
[20:57] taken by the babylonians because of
[20:59] their adultery
[21:00] because they're espoused and once you're
[21:02] a spouse you're married for life
[21:04] they were still espoused to god but god
[21:07] found them in fornication and refusing
[21:09] him
[21:10] before the the that before they accepted
[21:13] the marriage covenant and coming to the
[21:14] union
[21:15] so he put them away but it kept them
[21:17] espoused to him
[21:20] so when they would serve other gods they
[21:21] considered adulterers
[21:25] you got it so in horeb he said he made a
[21:28] covenant with us
[21:30] and that covenant was when the trumpet
[21:32] sound long when when the serpent sounded
[21:35] long there was
[21:35] voices under that great trumpet and the
[21:38] voices under the trumpet were the ten
[21:40] commandments
[21:41] and when he spoke the ten commandments
[21:43] that's all the law that he was going to
[21:45] give to them
[21:46] everything else he they needed he would
[21:48] speak directly but this is all he wanted
[21:50] to give to them
[21:51] this is what if you'll do this we'll
[21:53] stay united in holy matrimony amen and
[21:56] he told them but when they be when he
[21:58] began to speak with his own voice and
[22:00] thundered out those thunders that were
[22:01] under the great blast of the trumpet
[22:03] amen they refused to come up but they
[22:05] ran away and hid
[22:06] and so they rejected the covenant he
[22:09] came and he fulfilled his end of the
[22:10] covenant
[22:11] but they rejected the fulfilled there
[22:13] into the covenant
[22:14] they would not go up and go up into him
[22:17] and they refused him
[22:19] so he put her away praise god
[22:23] so let's look at verse two again in the
[22:25] lord our god made a covenant with us
[22:27] in horeb the lord made not this covenant
[22:30] with our fathers but with us
[22:31] even us who are all of us here alive
[22:33] this day
[22:34] the lord talked with you face to face in
[22:36] the mount out of the midst of fire
[22:38] i stood between the lord and you at that
[22:40] time to show you the word of the lord
[22:42] for you were afraid by reason of the
[22:43] fire and went
[22:45] not up into the mountain see that was
[22:48] the mistake
[22:49] they went not up into the mountain let's
[22:51] go back to exodus 20. i just really want
[22:54] to lay this
[22:55] in i know we went over it wednesday but
[22:57] i want to lay it in tight here again
[23:00] exodus 20 verse 18.
[23:04] and all the people saw the thunderings
[23:06] and the lightnings and the noise of
[23:08] trump and and the mountain smoking and
[23:10] when the people saw what they removed
[23:11] and stood afar
[23:12] off and they said unto moses speak thou
[23:14] with us and we will hear
[23:16] but let not god speak with us lest we
[23:18] die
[23:20] and moses said unto the people fear not
[23:21] for god has come to prove you
[23:23] and that his fear may be before your
[23:25] faces that you sin
[23:27] not and the people stood afar off and
[23:29] moses drew near unto the thick darkness
[23:32] where god was so
[23:35] so when the fire came down it was a
[23:37] thick darkness
[23:38] and the people were afraid and moses is
[23:41] saying don't be afraid he's just trying
[23:43] to prove you
[23:44] amen don't be afraid but they refused
[23:46] they
[23:47] actually they ran away and stood afar
[23:49] off they were supposed to come up but
[23:51] they ran away and stood afar
[23:52] off and they said let not god speak to
[23:54] us lest we die
[23:56] amen and the very thing that was going
[23:58] to bring life they saw was death
[24:01] the very thing that that that would have
[24:04] taken them into the
[24:05] confirm the covenant and brought them in
[24:07] union they saw his death and they feared
[24:10] and they ran away but moses
[24:13] amen because moses is the type of christ
[24:16] moses went
[24:16] up to god in the thick darkness
[24:20] thick darkness what's thick darkness
[24:22] it's the mystery
[24:24] the thick darkness light is illumination
[24:27] light is the word darkness is absent of
[24:29] light or absence of the word
[24:30] or the hidden word let's say because
[24:33] when brother branham
[24:34] when he talks about the vision of junior
[24:36] jackson when he peels the top off of
[24:38] that rock
[24:39] and he says light has never shown on
[24:41] this before it's been
[24:42] in darkness it's been in the thick
[24:45] darkness
[24:46] amen because the light has never hit
[24:48] this part before
[24:50] and so god comes down and moses said god
[24:53] came down in a fire
[24:55] but when god came down in a fire around
[24:58] the fire was thick darkness
[25:00] so there was a mystery on the mountain
[25:03] there was a hidden mystery on the
[25:05] mountain and it was thick darkness and
[25:06] when moses went in he disappeared behind
[25:08] the thick darkness
[25:09] but when moses went in he could see
[25:12] because it was the shekinah glory
[25:14] of light it was the fire of god it was
[25:15] the light of god
[25:17] so it wasn't that that light that thick
[25:19] darkness didn't blind moses it blinded
[25:21] everybody else to what moses was seeing
[25:25] so on one side it's darkness on one side
[25:27] it's light amen it's the same thing as
[25:29] when the children of israel come out
[25:31] of egypt and the pharaoh was coming
[25:33] after them and they were hemmed in
[25:35] pinned against the red sea and the
[25:36] pillar of fire moved behind them
[25:38] and it was darkness to pharaoh but it
[25:40] shined light unto the children of israel
[25:43] and it's the same thing with moses he
[25:44] goes into the thick darkness
[25:47] and in the thick darkness he can see but
[25:49] everybody else can't see what moses can
[25:51] see
[25:52] because the only way to see what moses
[25:54] sees is to go where moses
[25:56] went
[26:00] that's that's better than we realize
[26:03] because the only way to see what brother
[26:04] branham saw was to go where brother
[26:06] branham went
[26:10] we've got to make the same journey he
[26:11] made
[26:14] now let's go look at uh malachi chapter
[26:17] 4 together
[26:22] malachi we're very familiar with malachi
[26:26] chapter 4.
[26:33] i want to start at verse 4. malachi
[26:36] chapter 4
[26:37] verse 4. we know that this scripture
[26:41] pastor is going to lay down a prophecy
[26:43] for us in our day
[26:44] turning the hearts of the children back
[26:46] to the original pentecostal fathers
[26:48] and it's going to be through the
[26:50] ministry of elijah but verse 4 says
[26:52] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[26:55] which i commanded him in horeb for all
[26:57] israel with the statutes and judgments
[26:59] so before he moves into this prophecy he
[27:02] wants you to remember horeb
[27:05] because what happened in horeb they made
[27:08] their fatal mistake in horeb
[27:10] they chose law over grace
[27:14] and so now we understand that statement
[27:17] better by what happened at horeb when
[27:19] they
[27:19] chose law over grace they chose to have
[27:22] somebody in between them and god
[27:25] they chose to have somebody go talk to
[27:28] god for them
[27:29] face the fierce judgment of god for them
[27:32] come down and give it to them and give
[27:35] it to them
[27:36] in a rule book amen and then they would
[27:38] they agreed that they would keep the
[27:39] rule book but they never were able to
[27:41] keep the rule book
[27:44] and they thought that keeping the book
[27:47] on earth in a human way was
[27:50] better than ascending the mountain and
[27:52] going into the thunders and the
[27:54] lightnings and the earthquake and the
[27:55] smoke and the fire
[27:57] because if we go there we'll die
[28:00] and that's the truth if you go there
[28:03] you'll die and that's the best thing
[28:06] that'll ever happen to you
[28:07] is if you go up there and let the
[28:08] lightning and the thunder and the fire
[28:10] and the and the earthquake
[28:11] kill you and resurrect you there
[28:15] in that shekinah glory light amen so
[28:17] they
[28:18] they now they would take they would
[28:20] refuse
[28:21] grace and take law they would refuse god
[28:24] and take moses a human a
[28:28] human office to mediate between the two
[28:31] and now when he's coming to the
[28:32] prophecies the end time at the end of
[28:34] the church ages
[28:35] behold i send you the light of the
[28:36] prophet before the great and dreadful
[28:38] day of the lord
[28:39] before that prophecy he wants you to go
[28:41] back and remember
[28:42] horeb remember moses remember horror
[28:45] remember the laws with the statues and
[28:46] judgments
[28:47] and don't repeat this process again
[28:50] amen you're coming to another mountain
[28:52] i'm coming to the top of mount zion
[28:54] amen the headstone the capstone will be
[28:56] coming down because revelation 10
[28:59] 7 is the same as malachi 4 5.
[29:03] so now we're coming the the the light is
[29:06] descending
[29:07] the cloud is coming down the capstone is
[29:09] falling
[29:10] it doesn't matter what term you want to
[29:12] use or how you describe it it's the same
[29:14] thing
[29:14] he's coming down upon mount zion to
[29:16] confirm the covenant
[29:19] of what marriage
[29:24] amen for what the invisible union
[29:28] and so now remember horeb and don't do
[29:32] what they did there don't run away from
[29:34] the thick darkness but go into the thick
[29:37] darkness
[29:38] and see because it's amazing to me i
[29:41] i titled this do not fear his voice
[29:43] because
[29:44] his voice was calling amen in the long
[29:47] trumpet the long trumpet was the voice
[29:49] of god
[29:50] god was speaking to them face to face
[29:52] but what was he speaking
[29:54] he was speaking the ten commandments
[29:57] showing that in our day it's going to be
[30:00] the long
[30:01] thunder the the long trumpet blast the
[30:03] jubilee
[30:04] trumpet that's going to sound and under
[30:06] that are thunders which are voices of
[30:08] god
[30:08] amen and what is it it's god himself
[30:11] speaking to us
[30:12] just like he was god there giving ten
[30:14] commandments it's god here giving the
[30:16] revelation of the seven thunders
[30:21] and and when he when he does that that's
[30:23] the jubilee call
[30:25] that's the signal that's the time the
[30:27] very place that we were forbidden to go
[30:30] and the thing we were forbidden to touch
[30:31] amen now it's time
[30:33] that we've been stayed sanctified by the
[30:35] word amen cleansed and washed our
[30:37] clothes and sanctified and set apart
[30:39] for three days waiting waiting waiting
[30:41] through luther through wesley through
[30:43] pentecost but after three days
[30:45] now the trumpet sounds and it's time to
[30:48] go to the top of the mountain and unite
[30:50] with him but because it was thunders
[30:53] and lightnings and voices and thunders
[30:56] and an earthquake and smoke and fire
[30:59] they ran the other way
[31:00] amen and many have done the same thing
[31:03] today
[31:04] amen we'd rather stay around the base of
[31:06] the mountain
[31:07] let brother branham go up and connect
[31:09] with god
[31:10] and him come down and tell us what to
[31:12] say and now we're
[31:13] so worried and so fearful to hear from
[31:16] god ourselves
[31:17] that the only thing we'll do is push
[31:19] play on a tape and won't let a preacher
[31:21] preach the word
[31:22] because we're afraid to get off and
[31:25] touch the mountain and be slain by the
[31:26] mountain
[31:31] you see we repeated the same thing he
[31:34] said yeah yep
[31:35] all them tape people it happens the same
[31:37] thing in a church when we ourselves
[31:39] refuse
[31:40] and let the preacher do it all for us
[31:43] it's the same exact problem that we have
[31:45] amen but what if i get it wrong or what
[31:48] if it kills me
[31:49] it's supposed to kill you amen you're
[31:51] supposed to for
[31:52] brother brennan when he went into that
[31:53] cloud he said i went plumb out of my
[31:55] knowing
[31:58] we need to get caught up in the cloud
[32:00] and get plumbed out of our knowing
[32:02] and get a totally different knowing
[32:05] see that trumpet sounded long
[32:08] the seven thunderstounded and what he
[32:10] was he saying he was saying
[32:12] come up here to me
[32:15] come unite with me i want to speak to
[32:18] you face to face
[32:19] i want to give you revelation myself
[32:26] but we get so fearful
[32:30] because i mean
[32:33] to go to that mountain is death
[32:36] and look it's rumbling and thundering
[32:40] and lightnings if i go in the wrong
[32:44] condition
[32:45] i'll die
[32:49] oh praise god don't be afraid of god
[32:53] god's done this to prove you to see
[32:56] whether you love him or not
[32:59] see this is why it's still so easy for
[33:03] human beings
[33:05] to take the precious message that god
[33:08] gives us
[33:08] and turn it from what he gave us into
[33:11] statutes and judgments and laws
[33:14] going back to horeb and he told us
[33:18] before the prophecy of elijah now
[33:19] remember horeb
[33:21] remember moses remember horeb don't
[33:24] do with this what they did there
[33:27] because it's very much a repeat of the
[33:29] same circumstances
[33:31] and so now god wanted to be in a
[33:33] covenant with the people where he would
[33:35] speak himself
[33:36] amen and the people would be able to
[33:38] hear from him amen but that was too
[33:40] fearful for them
[33:42] so they wanted to stick with a system
[33:44] and from that
[33:45] time forward amen the children of god
[33:48] had been
[33:48] trapped and tricked into the system
[33:52] because in that day the system
[33:55] looked safer than the journey to the top
[33:58] of the mountain
[33:59] amen
[34:02] right it looked safer it looked like
[34:06] i i you know i don't have to risk it
[34:10] i don't have to risk being wrong i don't
[34:12] have to risk being an
[34:13] heir i don't have to risk everybody
[34:15] mocking me or making fun of me or
[34:18] i don't have any risk i'll let moses
[34:20] take all the risk
[34:27] that's why moses was the only one with a
[34:29] shiny face
[34:32] and moses was the one who went in behind
[34:34] the veil and because he was the only one
[34:35] who went in
[34:36] behind the veil now he's got to stand
[34:38] behind the veil to them because they
[34:39] can't break behind the veil
[34:41] so moses has to be veiled to them and
[34:43] their heart has to be veiled to the word
[34:45] because they refuse to go behind the
[34:46] veil
[34:48] so moses is the only one that went into
[34:50] the presence of god
[34:51] and become like god
[34:55] until the word was so in him that he was
[34:58] shining forth
[34:59] amen from his face from his mouth was so
[35:02] shiny
[35:03] that they couldn't behold the look upon
[35:04] him they couldn't stand to look up on
[35:06] him
[35:07] and so we we we are human beings
[35:13] prone to the exact same temptations they
[35:16] had back there
[35:19] willing to let another human being take
[35:21] the risk of climbing that mountain and
[35:22] getting direct revelation from god
[35:26] because we're afraid to take the journey
[35:30] ourselves
[35:35] and you say but it's blackness it's
[35:37] pitch dark how can you find your way
[35:39] how can you know what's i mean once you
[35:41] get up into that
[35:43] thick darkness you can't see nothing
[35:45] there's there's nothing written
[35:47] on the white stone there's nothing
[35:51] written about it in the bible
[35:52] how can you go into that darkness and
[35:54] can't see anything
[35:55] and you don't realize the minute you
[35:57] break through the darkness it's all
[35:59] light it's all fire of god it's all
[36:01] shiny and bright
[36:02] amen we've got to be willing to break
[36:05] through the darkness
[36:07] and because brother brennan's been
[36:09] through the darkness
[36:12] oh i just feel it coming i'm going to
[36:15] say some things that are going to get me
[36:16] in big trouble but you here know my
[36:18] heart and know what i'm saying so i'm
[36:19] going to say it anyways
[36:21] will that brother branham break through
[36:23] the darkness
[36:24] and come back so i'll never
[36:28] venture past what is super clear and
[36:31] easy and what he says
[36:33] 10 or 15 times
[36:40] now i've never preached preaching beyond
[36:42] the prophet i'm never preached preaching
[36:44] what he didn't preach
[36:46] and i never will
[36:49] but we get so trapped in the same trap
[36:52] at horeb
[36:54] that if you if you can't show me a quote
[36:57] book on that i know he said it one time
[36:58] there that when he says this way
[37:00] and it looks like a discrepancy i'm just
[37:02] not going to touch it
[37:07] did that spirit come from amen
[37:10] the message has been given to us what is
[37:13] it it's the voice of god calling his
[37:15] bride up higher
[37:16] coming to unite with him it's the
[37:18] revelation of jesus christ
[37:20] it doesn't matter if he said it one time
[37:22] 10 times amen it doesn't matter
[37:24] if he's preaching it and by revelation
[37:26] god can strike it into your heart and
[37:28] you can see it in the word
[37:29] then it's for you it's the revelation of
[37:32] jesus christ
[37:34] but we get so timid with the word amen
[37:37] because we're so
[37:38] fearful of getting wrong or doing wrong
[37:40] or being wrong
[37:41] amen and if you're an elected gene of
[37:43] god how in the world are you going to
[37:45] get so wrong that you've moved outside
[37:47] of redemption
[37:48] how are you going to be lost amen even
[37:51] if the rod of correction will come down
[37:53] and hit you hard
[37:54] amen he will not lose you you can no
[37:56] more be lost and god can be lost
[37:58] and god is not complete without you and
[38:00] so there's now
[38:01] no fear this this message has come to
[38:04] take the scare away
[38:06] the fear of the mountain we're not
[38:08] afraid of that mountain that's our
[38:09] mountain amen
[38:10] at the top of the mountain is my lord
[38:12] amen i'm not afraid of that mountain
[38:14] it's a scary thing to the flesh but i'm
[38:16] not paying attention to the flesh
[38:18] i'm not worried about the naysayers i'm
[38:20] not worried about the denominational
[38:22] mind
[38:22] amen at the top of that mountain is
[38:25] everything i've waited for all of my
[38:26] life
[38:27] it's him amen it's the union with him
[38:29] it's the revelation of who i actually
[38:31] am it is my lord and me and him together
[38:34] in a union amen
[38:35] i can't stay away from the top of that
[38:37] mountain and where is it
[38:39] it's behind the thick darkness friends
[38:41] it's not the obvious it's not the easily
[38:43] seen
[38:44] amen you won't see it till you're
[38:46] willing to go there
[38:47] and take ridicule and take scorn and
[38:49] take a chance
[38:50] [Applause]
[38:53] hey amen scared to death to take a
[38:56] chance
[38:57] what if it's not for me what if i get
[38:59] lost what if i'd
[39:03] that's not the spirit he's looking for
[39:05] in this day he's calling for a bride to
[39:07] match his own character
[39:10] he's looking for somebody who'll say god
[39:12] i have to know more
[39:15] i got to know more i got to know what is
[39:17] this is real
[39:18] and i don't want to know secondhand if
[39:20] it's real i don't want to see the
[39:22] shining life
[39:23] off the face of my brother and sister
[39:25] and say yep they've been in the shekinah
[39:26] glory
[39:26] i see the shekinah glory around their
[39:28] life emanating off of them
[39:30] it must be real if you see that it's
[39:32] still a veil in your heart
[39:37] but i want to go see him face to face
[39:42] with an unveiled face and how do i get
[39:44] the veil taken away
[39:46] in christ and where is christ christ is
[39:48] the word that's been delivered this day
[39:51] through a prophet
[39:54] all of it not the easy parts
[39:57] not the widely accepted parts only
[40:01] not the parts that are easy to match
[40:04] with an intellectual understanding of
[40:06] the bible
[40:10] it's not that only amen because
[40:14] you can get your message theological
[40:15] degree and do a pretty good job in
[40:17] debate and study
[40:19] because there's so much of the bibles
[40:21] open so much of the scripture
[40:25] but there are some things brother ben
[40:26] says about the scripture
[40:28] that make zero sense to the intellectual
[40:30] mind
[40:33] none well this is
[40:37] but in your mind there is no way to make
[40:39] that fit
[40:41] so we leave that out of our message
[40:43] textbook
[40:47] amen do you see what i'm trying to say
[40:49] friends
[40:51] ah let's not when we're moving in to
[40:54] elijah
[40:55] the coming of elijah to turn the
[40:57] harshest jump back to the fathers
[40:59] let's not forget horeb let's not forget
[41:02] what happened in horeb
[41:05] wants a people who aren't afraid of him
[41:08] [Music]
[41:09] and aren't afraid of his word and aren't
[41:12] afraid to climb the mountain of the word
[41:15] and i don't know my next step it's
[41:17] covered in thick darkness
[41:19] but i believe when i get there i'll see
[41:21] the lights
[41:23] where where is this going to end brother
[41:25] where is that revelation going to end
[41:27] where does that go next i don't know but
[41:30] i believe when i step into the thick
[41:32] darkness of that amen that part of the
[41:34] word that part of the message i believe
[41:35] when i step into the thick darkness
[41:37] the light will be there to shine
[41:41] amen praise be to god
[41:46] so the apostle paul he brings us
[41:49] in in hebrews uh chapter 12. we've read
[41:53] this several times but in hebrews
[41:54] chapter 12
[41:55] he says you've not come to the mountain
[41:56] that can be touched it burns with fire
[41:58] he said you've not come to mount sinai
[42:00] but you've come to a mountain
[42:02] so don't miss this what was natural to
[42:05] them is spiritual to us
[42:06] you've not come to that sinai but you
[42:08] have come to mount zion
[42:10] and on this mount zion is an innumerable
[42:12] company of angels
[42:14] it's it's the sprinkling of blood that
[42:16] speaketh better things it's a mediator
[42:18] of christ
[42:19] all of this is on the mountain of this
[42:21] word of mount zion
[42:23] so the apostle paul brought us to the
[42:25] mountain
[42:27] but brother branham was there at the
[42:29] capping of the mountain
[42:32] the cornerstone and the headstone the
[42:35] alpha the omega
[42:36] the first church age messenger of
[42:38] prophet the last three stage messenger
[42:39] of prophet
[42:40] amen the cornerstone christ the
[42:42] foundation that was laid through paul
[42:44] the wise master builder and now there's
[42:45] going to be another
[42:46] wise master builder that's going to come
[42:48] just like paul amen did at the beginning
[42:50] he's going to come at the end
[42:52] paul made sure the cornerstone was
[42:53] christ amen and the wise master builder
[42:56] at the end is going to make sure the
[42:57] headstone is christ
[42:59] the cornerstone and the headstone have
[43:00] to match and if the cornerstone was
[43:02] right and everything was built true and
[43:04] plumb
[43:04] working all the way up then the
[43:06] headstone will be the exact
[43:09] fit as the if the angles are right
[43:12] you see your cornerstone sets your right
[43:15] angle
[43:17] for the pyramid and it's tapered to set
[43:20] the degree of incline
[43:23] for the pyramid if
[43:26] every h can build off the cornerstone
[43:31] then as we go around we'll be square and
[43:33] the angle will be right
[43:34] square angle right square angle right
[43:37] and when we come to the capstone which
[43:39] is the perfect
[43:40] revelation of jesus christ if everybody
[43:42] is built off the cornerstone that paul
[43:44] laid correctly
[43:45] when the the next wise master builder
[43:47] comes with the capstone
[43:49] the capstone will fit perfect and
[43:51] everything's right
[43:52] proving that it's a perfect word it's
[43:55] jesus christ
[43:56] through seven church ages now capped off
[43:58] by his presence himself
[44:01] and if it didn't fit somebody's got
[44:03] something wrong somewhere
[44:07] praise be to god i love this word
[44:10] i absolutely love it and why do i love
[44:13] this word so much
[44:14] because the bondage and the bonds have
[44:16] changed in my denominational
[44:18] understanding been taken away
[44:19] and i can speak about this word because
[44:21] this word has become one with me
[44:23] and i can talk about it like i talk
[44:25] about a friend like i talk about
[44:26] anything else i know when i see
[44:31] praise god
[44:35] amen you can look at the plans
[44:39] to my house and you can know the
[44:42] dimensions the rooms where the bathrooms
[44:44] are going to be where the bedrooms are
[44:46] with the dimensions of them or how high
[44:47] it is
[44:47] what the grade finish grade is you can
[44:49] know all about my house
[44:51] but until you've lived in my house you
[44:54] don't know where the sun shines best in
[44:56] the summer
[44:57] and in the winter where the best place
[44:59] to put the plants and you don't know
[45:00] what color the wall is and you don't
[45:02] know how it feels
[45:06] so you may know all about my house but
[45:08] until you've lived in it you don't know
[45:10] my house
[45:13] and we can read the blueprint to the
[45:14] word and we can know all about the word
[45:17] but until you've gone inside the word
[45:19] and come into christ you
[45:21] don't know the word
[45:24] man that's why the pharisees missed him
[45:26] they knew all about him but they didn't
[45:27] know him
[45:28] and when he was there they'd never been
[45:29] in him and they didn't know
[45:33] praise be to god so this word is more
[45:36] than doctrine it's more than teaching
[45:38] it's
[45:38] more it's more than it's more than a
[45:42] draft it's more than an engineering
[45:43] drawing it's more than an
[45:45] outline it is the person jesus christ
[45:47] himself
[45:48] and when you come into him now you know
[45:50] what it feels like over here and where
[45:51] the sun comes in best in the winter
[45:56] praise be to god oh god it's so good
[46:01] all right let's look at a powerpoint
[46:08] bathroom says now notice now when this
[46:10] taken place junior
[46:11] he was talking about junior jackson's
[46:13] dream here in the seventh seal
[46:14] standing in the field had a big pyramid
[46:17] like that and there was something wrote
[46:18] on the rocks and i was revealing that to
[46:20] the people is that right junior
[46:22] about a year before it happened and
[46:23] notice the next thing now i took some
[46:25] kind of a bar and cut it off and on the
[46:27] inside was the white rock that had
[46:29] nothing road on it
[46:32] and at that time i started to the west
[46:33] and i told them all i said don't go out
[46:35] west stay here
[46:37] and look on this till i return went west
[46:39] for the blast returned
[46:41] back to the east with the holy spirit
[46:42] interpreting this unwritten word
[46:46] now if that isn't perfectly the god
[46:48] almighty i want you to know what is
[46:50] what am i trying to say this for friends
[46:52] is to show you we're at the end time
[46:54] so brother branham knew there's so many
[46:56] prophecies that have to be fulfilled at
[46:58] the end time
[46:59] and one of the main markers of the end
[47:01] time is the opening of the seventh seal
[47:03] and the opening of the seventh seal in
[47:05] revelation chapter eight one there was
[47:07] silence amen
[47:08] he said nothing was said but then you
[47:11] come over to the seven thunders and they
[47:13] thunders uttered their voices and john
[47:14] was told to write it not but seal it up
[47:16] he said see they're connected together
[47:19] he knows the seventh seal is the end
[47:21] time seal
[47:22] it has to do with the coming of the lord
[47:23] amen uh
[47:25] and and he knows it has to do with these
[47:27] seven thunders
[47:28] and down brother branham knows i mean as
[47:30] he's preaching serves is this the time
[47:32] that those seven thunders amen are
[47:35] the the mystery laying within the
[47:38] pyramid
[47:38] inside the word the unwritten part no
[47:41] light has shined on this before because
[47:42] when john heard it he was told not to
[47:44] write
[47:45] when daniel asked about it he was told
[47:46] to seal it up till the time of the end
[47:48] so brother branham knows when this
[47:50] vision is coming to take place
[47:52] he knows this is the end time and this
[47:54] is the
[47:55] end time then it's time for the end time
[47:57] seal which is the seventh seal
[47:59] and he's able to put it all together
[48:01] knowing when the when it's time for the
[48:03] revelation of the seven thunders or the
[48:05] mysteries
[48:06] the unwritten part are the unwritten
[48:08] seals that were still sealed however he
[48:10] words it
[48:10] when he comes to that he knows it's in
[48:12] time time for the opening of the seventh
[48:14] seal
[48:15] and we should know the same thing
[48:19] and so i'm going through this because i
[48:21] want if the lord will allow me if i
[48:23] could take some time
[48:24] i just want to review several things
[48:26] that we've learned over the last
[48:28] couple of years some things that god has
[48:30] brought to our attention and and kind of
[48:31] tie them together
[48:33] and paint a picture and so there'll be a
[48:36] lot of reviews he'd be like brother dad
[48:37] you've preached that before i know
[48:38] then we get to the next brothers have
[48:40] you preached it i know i know i know
[48:41] it's okay
[48:43] but i could preach this every day and
[48:45] still like it
[48:47] in fact i could talk about junior
[48:48] jackson's dream every day and still get
[48:50] excited
[48:51] you'll be like i haven't memorized i
[48:53] know but it's still amazing because when
[48:54] brother branham
[48:55] when he comes to the inner circles this
[48:57] the time he talks about those six dreams
[48:59] capped off by the vision of him getting
[49:00] caught up
[49:01] to the constellation of angels and he
[49:03] talks about junior jackson he goes back
[49:04] to that dream again
[49:05] and he says i took this sharp object
[49:07] like a crowbar and i ripped the top off
[49:08] of it and i said look on this
[49:10] he says that's been fulfilled today
[49:13] tonight
[49:14] so when he's preaching services this the
[49:16] time he's just fulfilled junior
[49:18] jackson's dream
[49:19] to tell them there's something within
[49:21] the word that light's never shown on
[49:23] we need to get a revelation i've got to
[49:25] go west to get the revelation
[49:26] and i'll bring it back amen that's
[49:28] fulfilled now
[49:30] no future fulfillment it was fulfilled
[49:32] right then
[49:35] so brother bam talks about this pyramid
[49:38] takes the cap off and there's a there's
[49:40] a white rock and
[49:41] and brother franco helped me do this
[49:43] several months back and we did in the
[49:44] shape of a pyramid
[49:46] at first i thought take the top off and
[49:48] there's something laying there flat like
[49:50] flat rock
[49:51] but brother branham said the pyramid
[49:53] within the pyramid
[49:56] it's within the word it's the same shape
[49:58] of the word it's the
[49:59] unwritten mystery that's been within the
[50:02] word the whole time
[50:04] everybody's been looking at the word the
[50:06] funny writing on the outside
[50:08] of the pyramid the pyramid is your bible
[50:10] the word of god
[50:11] but inside in the same shape and form of
[50:14] this word
[50:15] is an unspoken unwritten mystery
[50:18] that's been there the whole time it's
[50:21] been the white pyramid within the
[50:24] pyramid
[50:26] praise be to god and then brother
[50:30] branham when he
[50:31] sees this picture he calls it the
[50:32] pyramid cloud
[50:35] tying the two together what is this it's
[50:38] the same thing
[50:39] it's the white pyramid what is the white
[50:42] period
[50:42] pyramid christ is the mystery of god
[50:46] revealed what has been the unwritten
[50:49] what has been the unwritten part inside
[50:52] the book what has been the mystery
[50:53] within the bible
[50:54] it's been christ it's been god coming
[50:58] into flesh it's been the manifestation
[51:00] of god
[51:01] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[51:05] so when you when this when he sees this
[51:07] pyramid he sees this pyramid cloud
[51:09] when he first sees it he calls it a
[51:11] pyramid cloud he gets caught up into the
[51:13] pyramid of the constellation of the
[51:14] seven angels
[51:15] amen but he doesn't realize till later
[51:17] that that's actually the head of christ
[51:20] amen when he turns it to the right
[51:21] he sees the face of jesus christ
[51:23] recognizing now
[51:24] it's the capstone it's the headstone
[51:27] it's christ the headship to the body
[51:29] it is the mind of christ coming down to
[51:32] give the revelation of the white pyramid
[51:35] the rock within the rock
[51:39] in the seventh seal he says and you
[51:40] remember it was in the pyramid
[51:42] where the mysterious white rock was not
[51:44] written on
[51:46] and the angels took me into that pyramid
[51:49] of themselves
[51:51] oh i want you to catch this if if if you
[51:54] catch
[51:54] no catch everything i say but anyways
[51:56] catch this
[51:58] i love this word so much friends brother
[52:01] branham
[52:02] in order to catch the revelation has to
[52:05] go into the pyramid
[52:07] of themselves this is important
[52:14] i want to say it this way i don't
[52:16] believe it's
[52:18] i don't believe that it's okay for us to
[52:22] just be satisfied that brother branham
[52:23] got caught up in the consolation
[52:29] he said those angels took me into that
[52:31] pyramid of themselves
[52:33] the mysteries of god known only to them
[52:38] and now they with the messenger that
[52:40] come to interpret that pyramid
[52:43] or that message of the secret of the
[52:45] seven seals which lays with inside the
[52:47] pyramid
[52:49] so brother branham he
[52:52] goes inside that pyramid
[52:55] and at that time he knows that seven
[52:57] angels the seven angels that have the
[52:59] mystery of the seven thunders
[53:04] but he doesn't yet recognize
[53:08] that those seven angels were just
[53:10] outlining the head of christ that it's
[53:12] actually the head of christ coming down
[53:13] that it's actually they're representing
[53:15] christ coming
[53:16] or the full revelation the head the mind
[53:19] coming to the body to the church
[53:21] so that the church will see the full
[53:22] revelation of what the white stone is
[53:25] what the mystery of christ is
[53:27] through the whole bible and so now
[53:30] brother branham because
[53:34] i'll just say it this way
[53:37] and you know me so just love me anyways
[53:40] when brother branham gets caught up into
[53:43] the midst
[53:46] of those that pyramid into the mysteries
[53:48] known
[53:49] only to themselves he gets caught up and
[53:52] he comes out
[53:54] now brother branham is very much taking
[53:57] the same journey that moses took
[54:00] because moses gets caught up into the
[54:02] cloud
[54:03] and he comes back and now moses
[54:06] is the mystery if i could say it
[54:10] just stick with me now moses is the
[54:13] mystery
[54:14] because brother brennan says it was
[54:15] christ in moses
[54:18] moses now had the word he had the word
[54:20] of the covenant
[54:21] he had the word of god he understood
[54:23] about the temple and the dimensions of
[54:25] the temple and
[54:26] what god was going to do he was laying
[54:28] down the pattern
[54:30] that that the apostle paul was going to
[54:31] pick up and
[54:33] introduced to the gentiles but he's now
[54:35] he's caught the full revelation moses
[54:38] has
[54:38] and he's coming down he's caught in
[54:40] natural form i should say of a natural
[54:42] temple and tabernacle and
[54:44] all the vessels then he's coming down
[54:46] but
[54:47] now the mystery is in moses
[54:50] and moses i would say that now moses
[54:53] becomes the mystery
[54:55] that's why moses is wearing the veil
[54:59] because god is always behind the veil
[55:02] and now he's showing where the mystery
[55:04] lies and the mystery now lies in moses
[55:07] because moses got caught up and has the
[55:09] revelation
[55:13] so brother branham gets caught up amen
[55:15] and brother branham's moving down
[55:17] and now brother brenham has the
[55:18] revelation and i i know that
[55:20] each one comes to him each night and
[55:21] gives him the revelation of the seals
[55:23] but but brother branham is actually he's
[55:26] just like moses now he's coming down
[55:28] he what he has is not his own word what
[55:31] he has is not his own revelation
[55:33] something he's come up with
[55:34] he's been reading what man wrote he's
[55:36] been trying to piece it together
[55:37] he's been reading what he what he
[55:39] preached years ago about it but now he
[55:41] comes down
[55:42] and these angels come to him one by one
[55:44] every night giving the revelation and he
[55:46] just comes
[55:46] and gives it out amen he's very much
[55:49] playing the part of moses
[55:55] and what's he doing he's
[55:58] actually introducing the bridegroom to
[56:02] the bride
[56:05] brother branham is actually because the
[56:07] bridegroom
[56:08] is the word christ is the word
[56:12] in the beginning was the word the word
[56:13] was with god the word was god right
[56:16] so we know this it's the word so brother
[56:18] brethren's coming down
[56:19] with the mysterious part of the book
[56:21] he's coming down with the mystery that's
[56:23] been locked in the scriptures all this
[56:25] time
[56:25] and christ is the mystery of god
[56:27] revealed and don't forget
[56:29] christ is male and female
[56:32] christ is is god coming into
[56:34] manifestation
[56:37] now now he comes down and he starts
[56:39] through the preaching of the seals
[56:41] and he's presenting the bridegroom to
[56:43] the bride
[56:45] and he's not presenting the bridegroom
[56:47] to the bride
[56:50] just like he's showing a picture this is
[56:53] the bridegroom
[56:55] someday the bridegroom will come you
[56:57] want to know what he looks like and and
[56:58] i'm introducing you to him and i'm
[57:00] telling you all about him
[57:01] because someday he'll be here and i want
[57:03] you to be able to recognize him when he
[57:04] comes
[57:07] but he's here to help you in an
[57:10] invisible union
[57:13] and so he's not showing you a picture
[57:15] somewhere talking about somebody to come
[57:16] in a
[57:17] physical way but he's actually he's the
[57:20] mystery of the seventh seal
[57:22] because the seventh seal is the son of
[57:24] man amen
[57:26] the son of man is is is coming back in a
[57:28] prophetic form it's the return of the
[57:30] son of man it's the coming of the son of
[57:32] man it's the revealing of the son of man
[57:34] and the son of man is christ
[57:36] and christ is now here where is he at
[57:38] he's behind the veil of the tabernacle
[57:41] of the seventh angel
[57:42] and now the seventh angel becomes the
[57:45] mystery of the seventh seal
[57:51] brother rem's on the platform working
[57:53] miracles
[57:54] and doing signs and wonders and he says
[57:56] now he says if he was here
[58:02] he would do what i'm doing and he says
[58:04] it's not me doing it you know it's not
[58:06] me you know it's him
[58:09] and he does everything to prove that
[58:12] it's jesus christ present tense
[58:15] not the vessel of clay but the son of
[58:18] man
[58:18] and he tells you it's a son of man
[58:20] revealing the son of man
[58:24] so brother branham gets caught up he
[58:26] gets caught up into the mind of christ
[58:28] he gets caught
[58:29] up into the white rock now he he becomes
[58:33] the mystery
[58:34] that's in the white rock he becomes the
[58:37] mystery
[58:38] of the seventh seal you know chad what
[58:41] are you talking about
[58:44] when you look at brother branham in his
[58:45] ministry do you see a man from kentucky
[58:48] or do you see jesus christ
[58:52] and if you see jesus christ then you see
[58:55] the seventh seal
[58:57] because it was christ coming back to his
[59:00] church to prove himself to his church
[59:02] to give a covenant to the church so that
[59:04] the church can be joined in invisible
[59:05] union
[59:07] remember horeb don't forget horeb
[59:12] so when you look at that man and all
[59:14] he's done none of us look at that man
[59:16] and say what a man
[59:19] but we look at that and say what a
[59:21] savior what a bridegroom that's my lord
[59:25] so now within him he becomes the veil
[59:27] but he becomes
[59:28] the mystery of the seventh seal he's the
[59:31] messenger
[59:33] brother now get this he's the messenger
[59:36] of the seventh seal
[59:38] his ministry is the seventh seal because
[59:41] his ministry
[59:42] is the coming of the son of man
[59:46] it's the coming of the lord but how did
[59:48] he come first he come in a prophet form
[59:50] first
[59:52] just like moses
[59:56] but what did god want after
[1:00:00] he displayed himself in moses he showed
[1:00:02] the plagues he showed that it was him
[1:00:04] he gave his commandments he brought him
[1:00:06] to the mountain then he didn't just want
[1:00:08] moses to be the mystery of the seventh
[1:00:10] seal now he wanted the whole camp to be
[1:00:13] the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:00:16] remember horeb we're going to go in
[1:00:18] we're going to talk about elijah
[1:00:20] amen the coming of elijah amen to turn
[1:00:22] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:00:23] fathers but don't forget horeb
[1:00:25] god did not just want moses on the top
[1:00:27] of that mountain
[1:00:28] he wasn't just wanting to speak to moses
[1:00:30] only but he wanted to come into a
[1:00:32] marriage covenant with the whole
[1:00:34] nation of israel and he has not come
[1:00:37] down in this day to show the mystery of
[1:00:39] the seventh seal and one man to let it
[1:00:41] stay
[1:00:42] there only amen but he wants the mystery
[1:00:44] of the seventh seal to move to the
[1:00:46] second fold
[1:00:47] of the threefold mystery and the second
[1:00:48] fold is him getting preeminence and a
[1:00:50] bride
[1:00:51] and the bride now becomes the mystery of
[1:00:53] the seventh seal
[1:00:54] she becomes the mystery of the white
[1:00:56] rock amen she's got
[1:00:58] you but to do that you've got to get
[1:00:59] caught up into the mind of christ you
[1:01:02] got to go into christ and the veil is
[1:01:04] taken away
[1:01:05] when you go in the christ the veil is
[1:01:07] taken away amen
[1:01:08] and when the veil is taken away nothing
[1:01:10] about what i'm saying becomes difficult
[1:01:12] but everything about what i'm saying
[1:01:14] becomes
[1:01:14] that's nothing but the truth
[1:01:17] i may not explain it that way i mean i
[1:01:19] have the words amen but
[1:01:21] my heart i know that what you're saying
[1:01:24] is the truth and that's the journey that
[1:01:26] i got to take
[1:01:31] but you know it's thick darkness i mean
[1:01:34] it's a white stone
[1:01:35] and a pyramid with letters and and
[1:01:38] and and a pyramid cloud and
[1:01:42] face of christ i'm so confused
[1:01:46] it's all the same thing just different
[1:01:48] terms for the same thing
[1:01:50] it's our lord up there amen it's the
[1:01:52] lord jesus christ coming down himself
[1:01:54] but i didn't see him if you saw the
[1:01:56] opening of the word you saw him
[1:01:58] if you saw the revelation thunder you
[1:02:00] saw him if you saw the word in this day
[1:02:02] restored
[1:02:03] you have seen him because there's
[1:02:05] nothing different between the word
[1:02:07] and him but i'm waiting for his coming
[1:02:11] you haven't seen him yet amen who
[1:02:13] revealed this word
[1:02:14] who tied genesis to revelations in one
[1:02:17] package
[1:02:17] and showed the mystery of the bride and
[1:02:19] bridegroom through the whole thing
[1:02:21] that was him if you're still looking for
[1:02:23] him
[1:02:24] i'm telling you you're going to miss
[1:02:25] something because it's not the nail
[1:02:27] scarred hands we look for
[1:02:28] it's the word made manifest
[1:02:34] oh i'm just waiting and i'm watching
[1:02:42] oh friends if you can't see him in the
[1:02:45] word you can't seem
[1:02:48] in this dispensation because we're
[1:02:51] gentile
[1:02:52] not jew if we can't see him
[1:02:57] in the revealing of the mysteries and
[1:02:58] the revealing of the thunders the
[1:03:00] revealing of the word
[1:03:01] if we can't see him if all we see is
[1:03:04] white horse red horse black horse
[1:03:07] we still missed him
[1:03:12] if all we hear is thou shalt not steal
[1:03:15] thou shalt have no other gods before us
[1:03:21] for all you caught was the ten
[1:03:22] commandments
[1:03:24] but missed the voice speaking the
[1:03:26] commandments
[1:03:28] you missed him and if all we caught was
[1:03:31] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:03:33] then you caught the voice you missed the
[1:03:36] voice behind the voice
[1:03:39] you missed who was speaking because only
[1:03:42] the lamb can take the book and loose the
[1:03:44] seals thereof
[1:03:47] he can only do it in a certain time
[1:03:48] period he can only do it at a certain
[1:03:50] time
[1:03:51] and that's at the end time and at the
[1:03:53] end of the
[1:03:54] gentile dispensation at the end of the
[1:03:56] church ages and then brother brethren
[1:03:57] tells us
[1:03:58] every which way he can tell us through
[1:04:00] khrushchev
[1:04:01] and eisenhower through events in history
[1:04:03] through the opening of the seals
[1:04:05] to every way he can tell us he tells us
[1:04:07] it's the end time we're at the end of
[1:04:08] time end of the gentile dispensation
[1:04:10] into the church ages we've come to the
[1:04:12] end and if you come to the end
[1:04:14] now the lamb can take the book and loose
[1:04:16] the seals thereof and now the mighty
[1:04:18] angel can descend with an open book in
[1:04:19] his hand
[1:04:20] and now listen
[1:04:24] because let's not leave the scriptures
[1:04:29] now when he comes down seven thunders
[1:04:30] utter their voices john's told not to
[1:04:32] write
[1:04:33] he lifts his hand to heaven and swears
[1:04:34] by him that lives forever and ever that
[1:04:36] time shall be no more
[1:04:37] and then then then
[1:04:40] the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:04:42] mystery of god should be finished
[1:04:45] not when he goes on his healing
[1:04:46] campaigns
[1:04:48] but when he begins to break the word
[1:04:49] with the revealing of the seals
[1:04:52] then you have the seven thunders or the
[1:04:54] yeah then you have the seven thunders
[1:04:56] then you have the voice
[1:04:57] the mystery of god finished in the voice
[1:04:59] of the seventh angel
[1:05:00] perfect we're right with the scriptures
[1:05:05] then there's a voice that tells john
[1:05:09] john not the seventh angel john
[1:05:13] go to the mighty angel amen
[1:05:18] not the seventh angel go to the mighty
[1:05:22] angel
[1:05:22] christ himself and take the book out of
[1:05:25] his hand
[1:05:26] and eat it up up i say
[1:05:30] all right eat it
[1:05:33] all not the most palatable parts not too
[1:05:36] easily digested not the parts everybody
[1:05:38] else has aiden told you about
[1:05:39] but eat it all and in your mouth it'll
[1:05:42] be sweet as honey but in the
[1:05:43] belly be bitter and then he says for
[1:05:45] thou must prophesy again
[1:05:48] not the seventh angel
[1:05:53] but john when we come to revelation 10
[1:05:57] i'd like to tie revelations 10 to
[1:05:59] revelations 4
[1:06:00] because brother branham ties them
[1:06:02] together so if we're going to come to
[1:06:04] revelation
[1:06:05] 10 i'll say it this way don't forget
[1:06:08] horeb remember my servant moses remember
[1:06:13] remember the statues in the judge
[1:06:14] remember the great failure
[1:06:16] the great mistake the fatal mistake that
[1:06:19] they made in exodus 19
[1:06:20] and don't make the same mistake amen but
[1:06:23] be willing
[1:06:24] be have your conscience pricked amen be
[1:06:26] awake and say
[1:06:27] i've got to go beyond amen i've got to
[1:06:31] go beyond
[1:06:32] anything on flesh and anything on earth
[1:06:34] and any human being
[1:06:36] and i've got to go to the mighty angel
[1:06:38] himself
[1:06:39] and get this book it's more than going
[1:06:42] to the library and getting a seals book
[1:06:44] friends
[1:06:45] it's more than getting a church book in
[1:06:47] a seals book amen this is a different
[1:06:49] kind of book amen
[1:06:50] it's not the book with print on paper
[1:06:52] but it's the book of the revelation of
[1:06:54] himself
[1:06:55] amen and then when you get the book of
[1:06:57] the revelation of himself
[1:06:58] you look in that book and you can see
[1:07:00] your name is written there
[1:07:03] what are you eating you're eating you're
[1:07:05] digesting you're feeding on the
[1:07:06] revelation
[1:07:07] of you are in christ you have
[1:07:10] always been in christ you are part of
[1:07:13] god and always will be part of god
[1:07:15] your name is on the book it gives you a
[1:07:17] right to go to the mighty angel yourself
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:19] eat the book
[1:07:23] praise be to god
[1:07:27] oh i know to the world it sounds crazy
[1:07:30] take a book go to christ get a book eat
[1:07:32] a book
[1:07:33] capstone you know sharp sword unwritten
[1:07:36] word
[1:07:37] thunders and voices and it's all the
[1:07:40] same thing
[1:07:42] it's the seven seals the coming of the
[1:07:44] lord coming to what coming to unite with
[1:07:46] the bride
[1:07:47] he comes with an open book in his hand
[1:07:48] he's calling for his bride to come stand
[1:07:50] by his side
[1:07:52] how's he calling them he's calling names
[1:07:54] but he's not calling like ormond neville
[1:07:55] or chad
[1:07:56] lam he's revealing the mysteries
[1:07:59] and revealing the mysteries is calling
[1:08:01] the names
[1:08:04] why because if you reveal the mysteries
[1:08:07] who did you reveal
[1:08:10] christ if you revealed the mysteries you
[1:08:13] revealed christ
[1:08:14] he is those seven seals
[1:08:19] so when brother ben revealed the seven
[1:08:21] seals he revealed jesus christ
[1:08:23] where as one that'll come someday he
[1:08:25] revealed jesus christ as the son of man
[1:08:28] who's here now
[1:08:29] the one who's revealing amen the one who
[1:08:32] peeled back the seals and gave the
[1:08:33] revelation
[1:08:34] he's he's the one who came in a portion
[1:08:37] of his spirit every night he meant
[1:08:38] through those seven angels to reveal
[1:08:40] reveal reveal reveal
[1:08:41] who did the revealing the holy spirit
[1:08:43] did the revealing christ
[1:08:48] praise be to god the the opening of the
[1:08:50] seals revealing christ
[1:08:53] the eating of the book is becoming one
[1:08:55] with christ
[1:08:58] going to him how do i go to him where is
[1:09:02] he
[1:09:03] he's all around you he's
[1:09:06] all around you he's been all around you
[1:09:08] all this time
[1:09:10] and i'm not talking in some mystical new
[1:09:12] age
[1:09:14] fancy fairy dust kind of he's in the
[1:09:17] hills and he's in the air
[1:09:22] he's in the revelation of his word he's
[1:09:26] in the unveiling of his word he's in the
[1:09:28] preaching of the unveiled word
[1:09:30] that's presenting christ every sunday
[1:09:32] every wednesday every time
[1:09:34] you pick up a book every time you play a
[1:09:35] tape it's presenting christ
[1:09:37] that's how you come to him you come to
[1:09:39] this revelation of this word
[1:09:40] and you feed on it and it alone and you
[1:09:43] absorb it with everything that's in your
[1:09:45] life
[1:09:45] so why so you can unite with christ
[1:09:49] so that he can take it from print on
[1:09:51] paper to a reality in your heart
[1:09:53] so it moves from understanding to
[1:09:55] revelation
[1:09:57] but it's never going to happen waiting
[1:09:59] for him to come
[1:10:02] we're never going to move from intellect
[1:10:04] to revelation waiting for him to come
[1:10:06] we're never going to move it's never
[1:10:08] going to move from paper to reality
[1:10:10] just sitting back on our heels and
[1:10:12] waiting them to come the only way it's
[1:10:13] going to happen is if we've heard those
[1:10:15] seven thunders we've got to start
[1:10:16] climbing this mountain
[1:10:18] and this mountain is this revealed word
[1:10:19] and step by step
[1:10:21] bite by bite eat the book take it in and
[1:10:23] say god you've got to make this a living
[1:10:25] reality oh christ i want to be one with
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:28] it's got to be more than paper and ink
[1:10:29] it's got to be more than a preacher's
[1:10:31] word
[1:10:31] it's got to be a living reality inside
[1:10:34] of me
[1:10:36] how are you going to get it don't wait
[1:10:37] he's here don't wait for him to come
[1:10:39] he's come
[1:10:40] amen don't wait for something else to
[1:10:41] happen it's already happened
[1:10:43] amen what we got to do is start up that
[1:10:45] mountain forget about the barriers and
[1:10:46] the old scarecrows and the old
[1:10:48] don't climb this mountain get past the
[1:10:50] barrier break through the barrier
[1:10:52] and start climbing this mountain
[1:10:55] one book two books another tape
[1:10:58] fellowship with believers preaching of
[1:11:00] the word
[1:11:01] what are you doing you're climbing the
[1:11:02] mountain
[1:11:08] i love the word of god
[1:11:12] so simple that it's confusing
[1:11:16] it's so easy it's hard
[1:11:20] i can't say it any other way but those
[1:11:23] who receive the new birth
[1:11:24] who've come in contact with him it's so
[1:11:27] simple
[1:11:29] but it's so complicated
[1:11:32] it just depends on which side of the
[1:11:34] thick darkness you're on
[1:11:38] which side of the pillar of fire you're
[1:11:40] on
[1:11:42] so complicated all these terms
[1:11:45] but when you see him all the terms say
[1:11:47] the same thing
[1:11:48] jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ
[1:11:51] jesus christ
[1:11:52] what's the cloud jesus christ what's the
[1:11:53] white stone jesus christ what's the
[1:11:55] thunders jesus christ what's the seals
[1:11:57] jesus christ what's the seventh seal
[1:11:58] jesus christ
[1:12:00] what's the bride mrs jesus christ
[1:12:06] terms terms terms terms terms amen but
[1:12:08] with a revelation in your heart all the
[1:12:09] terms mean the same thing
[1:12:10] it's him he's here he's present tense
[1:12:13] it's the seventh seal in action
[1:12:17] he's here let's not wait
[1:12:24] says in the easter seal or
[1:12:27] if we are ordained on that ground if we
[1:12:29] are ordained to be on that ground like
[1:12:30] the eagle walking in the chicken's nest
[1:12:32] if you're ordained on that ground the
[1:12:34] holy spirit is here to find you
[1:12:36] and when it finds you you recognize its
[1:12:38] call you know the hour you're living
[1:12:40] you know that these things are supposed
[1:12:41] to happen quickly you're raptured up to
[1:12:44] meet it
[1:12:47] i wanted you to read that so it wasn't
[1:12:50] me saying it
[1:12:52] because i've already been raptured
[1:12:58] now brother chad you don't believe in
[1:12:59] the physical i believe in a physical
[1:13:00] translation in my adam says of course
[1:13:03] why wouldn't i believe that who doesn't
[1:13:06] want to believe that
[1:13:09] but i've already been caught up where
[1:13:12] brother branham was caught up into that
[1:13:14] constellation of angels
[1:13:15] i've already been caught up into the
[1:13:16] mind of christ and he himself gave me a
[1:13:19] revelation of who he
[1:13:20] is that's the new birth
[1:13:24] and now you're sitting in heavenly
[1:13:25] places in christ jesus oh what a promise
[1:13:27] what a heavenly father
[1:13:30] who would give us these things
[1:13:33] raptured right up to meet it
[1:13:37] oh praise god
[1:13:43] brother man looking at this picture
[1:13:46] and the lord begins to speak to him
[1:13:49] trying to do god a service
[1:13:51] he says something said to me turn it
[1:13:52] right i thought oh i think i'm looking
[1:13:54] at it right
[1:13:55] so turn it right see i thought maybe
[1:13:58] that voice means turn it to the
[1:14:00] right and when i did you see what it is
[1:14:02] hoffman's head of christ at 33.
[1:14:04] here look in here see his black beard
[1:14:06] his face his eyes his nose and
[1:14:08] everything else see
[1:14:09] the part in his hair here coming up and
[1:14:11] he's wigged with the white angel wig to
[1:14:13] show that the message of him being god
[1:14:15] is the truth
[1:14:16] he is the supreme judge of the universe
[1:14:18] supreme judge of heaven
[1:14:19] and earth he is god and nothing else but
[1:14:22] god
[1:14:23] he is god expressed in human form called
[1:14:25] the son of god
[1:14:26] which the son was the mask and if that
[1:14:28] don't make our message
[1:14:29] exactly right identified by the
[1:14:31] scripture identified in service
[1:14:33] identified by his presence the same
[1:14:35] yesterday today and forever
[1:14:37] therefore those seven seals are the
[1:14:39] truth brethren
[1:14:42] what gave him the confirmation when he
[1:14:44] turned the picture to the right
[1:14:47] and he said oh it was a white pyramid a
[1:14:49] cloud
[1:14:50] it was a capstone absolutely it was
[1:14:53] seven angels
[1:14:54] it was but it was also the headship
[1:14:57] coming to the body
[1:14:58] it was also the mind of christ coming
[1:15:00] down it was his headship his
[1:15:02] identification
[1:15:03] coming to connect with his body
[1:15:07] he says in spiritual food and due season
[1:15:10] and one day turning it to the right
[1:15:12] looking there
[1:15:13] was jesus christ just as perfect as
[1:15:15] hoffman ever drawed him
[1:15:16] it was standing there with a white wig
[1:15:18] on looking back down towards the earth
[1:15:20] showing that he is supreme authority
[1:15:22] the heavens declare it the bible
[1:15:23] declares it the message declares it all
[1:15:25] the same
[1:15:26] supreme authority with the white wig
[1:15:28] going you see his black beard under
[1:15:30] many of you have seen the picture we got
[1:15:31] it back there just turn it to the right
[1:15:33] sideways look at it there he is just as
[1:15:36] perfect as it was
[1:15:37] if it had been photographed of him
[1:15:39] they're looking at it from the wrong
[1:15:41] angle
[1:15:42] you got to look at it in the right angle
[1:15:46] listen and only the lord can reveal
[1:15:49] which is the right angle
[1:15:55] only the lord brother branham you know
[1:15:58] what he
[1:15:59] this kind of statement just throws my
[1:16:01] heart because brother brahman just said
[1:16:02] turn it to the right you see his eyes
[1:16:03] you see his beard you see his hair you
[1:16:04] see the part in his hair he's saying
[1:16:06] brother i'm saying turn it to the right
[1:16:07] that's the right angle
[1:16:08] and he says see they're not looking at
[1:16:10] the right angle he said you've got to
[1:16:11] look at it at the right angle and
[1:16:13] only the lord brother branham saying
[1:16:15] turn it to the right
[1:16:16] is not getting you to see it at the
[1:16:18] right angle
[1:16:20] you can turn it to the right say ah it
[1:16:21] looks like some eyes may be there and
[1:16:22] there's a
[1:16:23] i can see the beard and i can see the
[1:16:24] outline and i can see this
[1:16:28] but friends at best it's a fuzzy
[1:16:32] depiction
[1:16:36] i'm not taking away from the clouds
[1:16:37] don't at best
[1:16:39] at best you're you're looking and
[1:16:42] straining and if you use some light
[1:16:44] filters
[1:16:44] it gets a little easier
[1:16:48] see what i'm saying it's not the natural
[1:16:50] that shows you the right angle
[1:16:56] you've got to look at it right you're
[1:16:57] not looking at it right brother ben was
[1:16:59] seeing seven angels
[1:17:00] he was seeing a pyramid of white rock he
[1:17:03] was seeing a revelation of seven
[1:17:04] thunders
[1:17:05] he was seeing this seeing this seeing
[1:17:07] this and he says you're not looking at
[1:17:08] it right
[1:17:10] he's talking about more than just
[1:17:12] turning to the right
[1:17:13] you can physically turn a picture to the
[1:17:15] right and look at it and say i see eyes
[1:17:17] and i see a beard and still
[1:17:18] not have the picture right
[1:17:21] because when the lord reveals to you the
[1:17:24] the right angle of this picture
[1:17:25] when you look at it right you say that's
[1:17:27] nothing but jesus christ
[1:17:30] come down to unite with his church
[1:17:32] that's the right angle and only the lord
[1:17:34] can show you
[1:17:35] the right way to look at this cloud
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:40] oh i love what he does stuff like that
[1:17:44] amen i want to
[1:17:47] i'm going to switch gears just a bit but
[1:17:49] not really it doesn't look like it but
[1:17:51] hang with me
[1:17:53] i want to read out a communion from 1962
[1:17:55] brother em's in february of 1962
[1:17:57] and we noticed 1962 is a huge year
[1:18:00] because brother brown's coming into 1962
[1:18:03] and he preaches in march of 1962 the
[1:18:06] spoken word is the original seed
[1:18:08] and in the spoken word is the original
[1:18:09] seed he starts to share with us that
[1:18:11] there's a change coming
[1:18:13] he said there's been three seeds planted
[1:18:15] there's been an evangelical seed planted
[1:18:17] there's been a pentecostal seed planted
[1:18:19] and he said the word's been planted
[1:18:21] now watch what it produces and he's
[1:18:24] telling the planting time is over we're
[1:18:26] moving we're transitioning
[1:18:28] then he comes later in the year and he
[1:18:29] preaches the present stage of my
[1:18:31] ministry
[1:18:32] and he's showing you we're in 1962 we're
[1:18:35] in transition
[1:18:37] and in the end of 1962 he preaches sirs
[1:18:39] what time it is when he talks about
[1:18:41] junior jackson's dream and going west
[1:18:42] and meeting the constellation of angels
[1:18:44] for the revelation of the seven thunders
[1:18:46] so it's 1962 it's a huge year it's a
[1:18:49] transitional year
[1:18:50] from brother branham and and here he
[1:18:52] comes right at the beginning of 1962 in
[1:18:54] february february 4th
[1:18:56] and a message called communion he says
[1:18:58] we see that the astronomers are
[1:19:00] predicting
[1:19:00] sometime in this early part of this
[1:19:03] first part of the month
[1:19:04] beginning on the second or the fifth or
[1:19:06] somewhere along this month the indian
[1:19:08] astronomers predict
[1:19:10] the world to blow to pieces and the
[1:19:12] american newspapers make fun of it
[1:19:14] i do not believe the world's going to
[1:19:16] blow to pieces but i do say it's wrong
[1:19:18] to make fun of it
[1:19:21] praise god you know they're still
[1:19:23] talking about astronomical signs
[1:19:25] disaligning that aligning and eclipses
[1:19:26] and
[1:19:27] i'll tell you there's something to it
[1:19:30] don't make fun of it
[1:19:31] but don't go read conspiracy theories on
[1:19:33] it either
[1:19:35] don't waste your time but there's
[1:19:37] something to it he does it first in the
[1:19:38] heavens before it does it on earth
[1:19:41] he said the american newspapers make fun
[1:19:42] of it i do not believe the world's going
[1:19:43] to blow the pieces but i do say it's
[1:19:45] wrong to make fun of him
[1:19:46] because something's fixing to happen one
[1:19:49] of these days
[1:19:50] something similar to that when the five
[1:19:52] planets mars jupiter venus and so forth
[1:19:54] comes into their
[1:19:55] they never have did it oh they claimed
[1:19:56] maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back
[1:19:59] there to know it
[1:20:01] i predict that this has a spiritual
[1:20:03] application
[1:20:05] big statement i believe it's
[1:20:09] the coming in of the issue of god that
[1:20:11] the great revelations of the word will
[1:20:12] be open during this time
[1:20:14] that's a huge statement he
[1:20:18] hasn't even preached surges this the
[1:20:19] time yet
[1:20:21] he hasn't even got the vision of getting
[1:20:23] caught up in the constellation
[1:20:25] he hasn't even heard about the six
[1:20:26] dreams yet
[1:20:28] but here he says i believe that great
[1:20:31] revelations of the word will be opened
[1:20:33] during this time
[1:20:34] remember they claim it was three stars
[1:20:36] that came into orbits when jesus was
[1:20:37] born
[1:20:38] and this is five and five is grace the
[1:20:40] number of grace three is the number of
[1:20:41] perfection five is the number of grace
[1:20:43] j-e-s-u-s grace g-r-a-c-e
[1:20:46] faith f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace
[1:20:49] god
[1:20:50] ever sends his power to the church it'll
[1:20:52] be his grace
[1:20:54] catch that god ever sends his power to
[1:20:56] the church it'll be his grace
[1:20:58] it won't be the obedience of the people
[1:21:03] as a prophet allowed to say that you
[1:21:06] could never be obedient enough to get
[1:21:08] god to send what he said
[1:21:11] he did it in his time
[1:21:14] that doesn't mean we're not supposed to
[1:21:15] be obedient
[1:21:17] and isaiah said in the 40th chapter how
[1:21:20] to cry to jerusalem that her warfare was
[1:21:22] over yet she was guilty of idolatry but
[1:21:23] it was god's grace that was sending him
[1:21:26] god sends anything to us it'll be his
[1:21:27] grace and not our merits
[1:21:29] so it may mean something i predict that
[1:21:31] there'll be a change
[1:21:32] i don't know what it'll be but i believe
[1:21:35] it's fixing to happen
[1:21:36] we're right on the eve of it now so
[1:21:39] brother branham reads in the paper and
[1:21:40] hears about this constellation of five
[1:21:42] planets coming together or whatever it
[1:21:44] is
[1:21:45] and and everybody's making fun of it and
[1:21:47] all this stuff is happening he said
[1:21:48] don't make fun of it there's something
[1:21:49] to it then he goes to say i believe it's
[1:21:51] going to be the issue of god
[1:21:53] bringing in these great revelations in
[1:21:55] the word
[1:21:56] and i believe something's coming and
[1:21:58] we're right on the eve of it now
[1:22:00] and the next month he preaches spoken
[1:22:03] word is the original seed which is a six
[1:22:05] hour message
[1:22:06] that tells us he's planted these three
[1:22:08] these three seeds are planted he's
[1:22:09] planted the word
[1:22:10] watch what's coming forth now
[1:22:12] something's going to come forth on the
[1:22:13] spoken word
[1:22:17] then he comes the next day for his
[1:22:20] spoken word the original seed the next
[1:22:21] day spoken word in the original seed was
[1:22:23] march 18
[1:22:24] 1962 on march 19
[1:22:28] 1962 he preaches the end time signed
[1:22:31] seed this is what he says
[1:22:35] three is the number of perfection we all
[1:22:36] know that three is god's number
[1:22:38] in his numerology god is known by his
[1:22:41] numbers three is perfection
[1:22:43] and seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is
[1:22:45] temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee so
[1:22:48] forth
[1:22:48] all of his numbers his numerals of god
[1:22:50] is perfected
[1:22:52] is in perfection now three is the number
[1:22:54] of perfection just before
[1:22:56] now listen close when the little baby
[1:22:59] christ was born three stars went
[1:23:01] together and made one morning star
[1:23:03] that reflected the coming of an infant
[1:23:05] christ a perfect one
[1:23:08] now what's happened we see a roar in the
[1:23:10] paper across the television out across
[1:23:12] the nations where five stars just fell
[1:23:14] in line with the world
[1:23:15] what five a number of grace every time
[1:23:17] these stars come
[1:23:19] then something happens on earth what
[1:23:20] taken place five stars fell in
[1:23:23] what was it an introducing of what
[1:23:26] he recognizes when the three lined up it
[1:23:28] was the introduction of a baby infant
[1:23:30] christ
[1:23:31] now he sees five line up and it's just
[1:23:34] happened in the paper
[1:23:35] he talked about it before he believes
[1:23:37] it's something coming he didn't know
[1:23:38] what it was but he believed it was
[1:23:40] something significant
[1:23:41] then he preaches spoken words the
[1:23:42] original seed and the next day he
[1:23:44] addresses that alignment of five planets
[1:23:46] and he says what is it it's the
[1:23:50] introducing of what
[1:23:52] since jen just look what taken place now
[1:23:54] pay close attention
[1:23:56] five stars line up it's introducing
[1:23:58] something three stars introduced to
[1:24:00] infant christ jesus christ when he was
[1:24:01] coming to earth
[1:24:02] five stars introducing something but the
[1:24:05] time of the introduction
[1:24:06] is a great time of trouble
[1:24:10] so just look what's taken place germany
[1:24:12] almost washed off the map
[1:24:14] some of the magi said that the world
[1:24:16] would burst like a watermelon
[1:24:18] every distressful things prophesied by
[1:24:20] them for the last days look what's taken
[1:24:21] place
[1:24:22] england the other day had a storm that
[1:24:24] blowed away 70 000 houses one day
[1:24:26] disasters everywhere california and los
[1:24:28] angeles
[1:24:28] like to wash into the ocean what is it
[1:24:30] the beginning of sorrows
[1:24:32] when those five planets and grace lined
[1:24:35] up to introduce something for grace
[1:24:37] there was judgment on earth at the same
[1:24:39] time
[1:24:41] this is a big deal
[1:24:45] amen the beginning of sorrows
[1:24:46] earthquakes has picked up everywhere why
[1:24:48] is it
[1:24:49] five stars coming in line grace god's
[1:24:52] grace
[1:24:53] you're like grace what do you mean grace
[1:24:55] germany isn't flooded
[1:24:57] i mean england almost blowed off the map
[1:24:59] los angeles earthquakes what are you
[1:25:00] talking about grace
[1:25:01] it's not grace to everyone it's grace to
[1:25:04] a specific group amen
[1:25:06] and god's grace is to bring destruction
[1:25:08] to this earth
[1:25:09] to bring forth a bright new millennium
[1:25:11] for the honeymoon that's his grace
[1:25:14] and so when destruction begins to fall
[1:25:16] upon the earth it's just the earth amen
[1:25:19] in birth pains
[1:25:20] trying to bring forth a bright new
[1:25:22] millennium amen for god
[1:25:24] and his children to dwell upon that's
[1:25:26] why when we read the paper now
[1:25:28] we see everything possible going wrong
[1:25:31] how many believes everything possible is
[1:25:33] going on brother brandon preached the
[1:25:34] world is falling apart
[1:25:35] i'd love for him to come back now and
[1:25:36] preach it again
[1:25:38] let him read the newspapers for a week
[1:25:40] and preach the message again
[1:25:41] it's falling apart he said let it fall
[1:25:43] apart the falling apart of the world is
[1:25:45] the new birth of the earth for a
[1:25:47] millennium
[1:25:48] why is everything picking up in
[1:25:50] intensity because there's got to be a
[1:25:52] timing amen
[1:25:54] the earth has got to go in birth pains
[1:25:56] amen because it's got to bring forth a
[1:25:57] bright new earth for a millennium
[1:25:59] amen so you can't have the birth pains
[1:26:01] too early and you can't even birth too
[1:26:03] late because the baby's got to be born
[1:26:05] at the right time for christ to come in
[1:26:07] his millennial reign with his bride
[1:26:09] so the two have to be on the same time
[1:26:11] sequence
[1:26:14] so if you can look at the papers and you
[1:26:16] can look at the earth and you can say
[1:26:17] birth pains are picking up i mean the
[1:26:19] contractions are one
[1:26:21] right on top of the other and the
[1:26:22] intensity is is overwhelming
[1:26:24] the baby's about to come then you know
[1:26:26] that it's
[1:26:27] time this is time for the bride to unite
[1:26:29] with christ
[1:26:30] amen it's time for the coming back and
[1:26:32] setting up the millennial reign on this
[1:26:34] earth
[1:26:34] for a thousand years it's the the
[1:26:36] condition of the earth is showing the
[1:26:38] maturity of the bride
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:42] and so for us when we read the paper
[1:26:44] it's devastating people are hurting
[1:26:46] the terrible things are happening but
[1:26:48] you can't help but let anticipation
[1:26:50] build on the inside because this is
[1:26:52] birth phase this earth is going to bring
[1:26:54] forth
[1:26:54] a brand new a much more habitable
[1:26:58] never mind
[1:27:01] a place where i can live
[1:27:05] i can't live in this one anymore amen
[1:27:07] this one's squeezing me out
[1:27:09] and pushing me out and there's no rest
[1:27:11] and there's no place
[1:27:12] just to relax and rest in this world but
[1:27:14] this world is rebirthing a new one
[1:27:16] through destruction
[1:27:18] amen and when it's finished there's
[1:27:19] going to be a place where i can live
[1:27:22] and so those planets those five of those
[1:27:24] something was being introduced
[1:27:26] and the introduction of something that
[1:27:28] was god's grace amen was bringing
[1:27:30] trouble upon the earth and the natural
[1:27:32] amen because these two go hand in hand
[1:27:38] praise god earthquakes is picked up
[1:27:41] everywhere why is it
[1:27:42] five stars come in line grace god's
[1:27:44] grace what's happened
[1:27:47] an infant church a bride infancy that
[1:27:50] the power of god has begun to fall on
[1:27:52] her
[1:27:52] she's taking form a bride for
[1:27:56] this bridegroom brother brethren
[1:27:59] recognized what it was
[1:28:00] amen there was a prophet here to say you
[1:28:03] know
[1:28:04] back then the three stars it was jesus
[1:28:06] christ coming as an infant upon the
[1:28:08] earth
[1:28:09] and now there's been five planets what
[1:28:10] is it there's an infant
[1:28:12] bride coming upon the earth and brother
[1:28:15] branham is here as the prophet of the
[1:28:16] age
[1:28:17] to point to these things that tell us
[1:28:19] what is happening in the economy of god
[1:28:21] and he's saying the the 1962 the
[1:28:24] transition year
[1:28:25] amen everything's been planted no more
[1:28:27] planting now the revival fires are dying
[1:28:29] down
[1:28:30] now it's time for what's been planted to
[1:28:32] come up and begin to bear fruit
[1:28:34] and what now is coming up at the
[1:28:35] alignment of five grace
[1:28:37] lady grace the bride amen is now
[1:28:40] beginning to come
[1:28:41] up out of the earth
[1:28:46] this is more than a neat story
[1:28:49] you realize the stars and the planets
[1:28:53] foretold it and the whole earth
[1:28:57] responded to it
[1:29:01] and you and i will hear it and be like
[1:29:02] that's kind of neat
[1:29:07] do you realize what's going on we're
[1:29:10] missing it
[1:29:12] we're missing the relevance the impact
[1:29:14] the power of what's on earth today
[1:29:18] prophet of god was here to what
[1:29:21] introduces second coming
[1:29:26] the john john the baptist came first
[1:29:30] and then jesus came
[1:29:33] the elijah ministry came first then the
[1:29:36] bride came
[1:29:38] you realize it's the same pattern what's
[1:29:41] happened before is repeating here now
[1:29:44] and this is a significant event three
[1:29:46] stars lined up
[1:29:47] jesus christ was born five stars line up
[1:29:50] the infant bride is coming forth
[1:29:52] it's just as impactful friends
[1:29:56] it's just as powerful just as impactful
[1:29:59] it's not a neat idea it's not a concept
[1:30:01] it's not a trivial thing we talk about
[1:30:03] to encourage ourselves it is the very
[1:30:05] event that the world is responding to
[1:30:07] and still responding to
[1:30:09] is this what those planets foretold now
[1:30:12] begin to be birthed on the earth because
[1:30:13] the seed of the word was planted and a
[1:30:15] word bride began to form and come up
[1:30:17] and the whole earth was responding and
[1:30:19] is still responding in every nation
[1:30:21] falling apart
[1:30:22] and diseases and pandemics and
[1:30:23] earthquakes and fires and floods
[1:30:25] what is it it's all responding to the
[1:30:27] fact that lady grace is here on the
[1:30:29] earth amen and she's
[1:30:31] she's almost done with what she's
[1:30:33] supposed to be doing
[1:30:37] i would i would say
[1:30:40] it's the most significant thing that's
[1:30:42] happening on earth now
[1:30:45] is what's happening inside you and i
[1:30:50] that's a mouthful but when brother
[1:30:53] branham was here
[1:30:55] when brother branham was here and all
[1:30:57] the events around his life
[1:31:01] it was the most significant thing that
[1:31:03] was happening on earth at the time
[1:31:07] when when that blast went off over
[1:31:10] sunset mountain
[1:31:11] and those angels appeared and got caught
[1:31:13] up into the constellation you tell me
[1:31:15] one thing on earth that happened that
[1:31:16] was more important than that blast
[1:31:19] the rocks rolling off the mountain what
[1:31:21] happened anywhere else that was more
[1:31:22] important than that
[1:31:26] when he comes back to preach the the
[1:31:28] seven seals he has a night of meetings
[1:31:31] eight days of meetings he preaches seven
[1:31:33] seals you tell me
[1:31:35] one event that was going on that was
[1:31:37] more significant than that event right
[1:31:38] there
[1:31:41] but because it happens in flesh and it's
[1:31:44] so humble
[1:31:45] and it's so basic it's so natural and
[1:31:47] then we overlook it and don't realize
[1:31:49] the significance
[1:31:50] and friends we don't realize the
[1:31:51] significance of our lives on this planet
[1:31:54] right now
[1:31:55] we keep we we we we suffer because we're
[1:31:58] stuck in human flesh and human mind
[1:32:00] we're suffering that's why we got to
[1:32:02] constantly be in the word all the time
[1:32:04] because the devil's constantly trying to
[1:32:06] distract us and and make everything
[1:32:08] normal and just human and just fleshly
[1:32:10] but the supernatural is taking place on
[1:32:12] earth right now
[1:32:17] said the bride the empathy that the
[1:32:20] power of god has begun to fall on her
[1:32:21] she's taking form a bride for this
[1:32:23] bridegroom
[1:32:24] that three stars meant is perfection of
[1:32:26] the heavenly father of the trinity
[1:32:28] becoming one on earth
[1:32:33] god's office is becoming one office what
[1:32:36] happened now it's the church of the
[1:32:37] living god coming together under the
[1:32:39] word of god
[1:32:40] and the astronomical heaven is
[1:32:42] announcing her approach amen
[1:32:43] might not believe that but it's the word
[1:32:45] just the same yes sir
[1:32:48] what happened i might say this friends
[1:32:51] the church is coming forth god's going
[1:32:52] to have a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:32:54] and she's predestinated god said so he
[1:32:57] would have it
[1:32:58] that makes it right who's a member i
[1:33:00] don't know i'm trusting to be
[1:33:01] myself i'm trusting that you are a
[1:33:03] member but he's going to have a body
[1:33:06] without spot or wrinkle and i believe
[1:33:08] that these latter-day signs and these
[1:33:10] things that's happening every one of
[1:33:11] them is peeling together to show that
[1:33:13] christ is ready to come
[1:33:15] for his bride as god in his word made
[1:33:17] manifest in a man a perfect man
[1:33:19] so is god and his word coming again and
[1:33:22] making himself manifest in a bride
[1:33:25] not not that not will do like eve did
[1:33:28] hybrid it to something else
[1:33:29] but the unadulterated word of god will
[1:33:31] be borne into that church
[1:33:32] and shall stand like jesus christ did
[1:33:34] with his holy spirit anointing his word
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:37] i believe it's the announcement now
[1:33:41] and guess what it's not the announcement
[1:33:44] now
[1:33:46] the announcement's gone forth now's the
[1:33:48] living reality of what he announced here
[1:33:50] on earth
[1:33:54] i say god let it change my thinking
[1:33:57] let it moan my character let it change
[1:33:59] every part of my life
[1:34:00] amen let this which is the most
[1:34:02] significant one of the most significant
[1:34:04] things happening on the planet
[1:34:06] let it be the most significant thing
[1:34:08] happening to me
[1:34:09] if it's important to you let it be
[1:34:11] important to me if it matters globally
[1:34:13] let it matter to me
[1:34:16] not make it trivial or just something
[1:34:18] we've heard all our lives or i've heard
[1:34:19] that preached before
[1:34:21] it's not about preaching friends it's
[1:34:22] about living it's not about the concepts
[1:34:25] about the reality
[1:34:26] it's not about it's not about the past
[1:34:28] it's not about the future it's about
[1:34:29] right now here today
[1:34:35] the spoken word is the original seed he
[1:34:38] says as the end time prophecies will
[1:34:39] repeat
[1:34:41] i believe as the first forerunner came
[1:34:43] from the wilderness and cried behold the
[1:34:44] lamb of god the second forerunner will
[1:34:47] probably do the same by pointing the
[1:34:49] people
[1:34:49] to a word-born bride wait a second
[1:34:54] wait a second he's supposed to come and
[1:34:58] be the forerunner of jesus christ
[1:35:01] he's supposed to repeat that elijah
[1:35:03] ministry is supposed to do what it did
[1:35:04] before in john the baptist
[1:35:05] john the patterns came to point out
[1:35:07] jesus christ
[1:35:08] and brother branham says that forerunner
[1:35:11] is going to point out
[1:35:13] a word born bride born by what the word
[1:35:17] brother branham says spoken words
[1:35:18] original seed the word's been planted
[1:35:20] now see what comes forth
[1:35:23] a word born bride the astronomical
[1:35:25] heavens announce it
[1:35:26] amen the earth amen goes into disarray
[1:35:30] amen at the time of the announcement
[1:35:33] by pointing the people to a word born
[1:35:35] bride the bride of christ
[1:35:38] will be pointed to the skies at the
[1:35:41] appearing of jesus
[1:35:44] screaming behold the lamb of god will
[1:35:46] come forth from
[1:35:49] his lips
[1:35:52] whose lips
[1:35:56] brother branham's lips
[1:36:00] that means he's got to be here at the
[1:36:03] appearing of jesus christ
[1:36:05] that means the same one who points out a
[1:36:07] word born bride is the same one's got
[1:36:09] the point that the skies are his
[1:36:10] appearing and say behold the lamb of god
[1:36:12] it's the forerunner ministry to show the
[1:36:15] bride is here
[1:36:16] now the bridegroom can come and unite
[1:36:18] with the bride amen
[1:36:19] we've got the bride we've got the
[1:36:21] bridegroom he points out the bride he
[1:36:23] points out the bridegroom
[1:36:27] so what are we waiting for let's climb
[1:36:30] the mountain
[1:36:32] let's climb this word and get to him
[1:36:36] he said what's happened upon mount
[1:36:38] sunset god confirming his word
[1:36:42] that's what all this noise is about
[1:36:43] notice it's god fulfilling his promised
[1:36:45] word again of revelation 10 1-7
[1:36:48] and in the days of the sounding of the
[1:36:49] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[1:36:51] god should be finished
[1:36:52] the hidden mystery of revelations 10 1-7
[1:36:55] the last message to the last church age
[1:36:57] fulfills exactly in this age
[1:37:00] saint luke 17 30 the day when the son of
[1:37:02] man
[1:37:03] shall be revealed the day when the son
[1:37:06] of man shall be revealed
[1:37:08] is when revelations 10 1-7
[1:37:11] at the sounding of the seven thunders
[1:37:14] brother brahm says improving his word
[1:37:17] now remember that was not jesus talking
[1:37:19] to abraham
[1:37:20] there he's taking us all the way back to
[1:37:22] the plains of memory
[1:37:25] where three men came walking up to
[1:37:26] abraham
[1:37:28] two angels that would go to sodom
[1:37:31] and one that would be elohim god himself
[1:37:34] and flesh
[1:37:35] that would stay with abraham
[1:37:39] he said that was not jesus talking to
[1:37:42] abraham there that could discern the
[1:37:44] thoughts on sarah's mind behind him
[1:37:45] that was not jesus he had not been born
[1:37:47] yet but it was a man in human flesh that
[1:37:49] abraham called elohim the great almighty
[1:37:52] and jesus says as it was in the days of
[1:37:54] sodom now watch close
[1:37:55] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[1:37:57] the coming of the son of man
[1:37:59] when the son of man is being revealed so
[1:38:02] what's the coming of the son of man
[1:38:04] it's the revealing of the son of man
[1:38:07] he's coming and revealing himself it's a
[1:38:09] son of man
[1:38:10] revealing the son of man
[1:38:14] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:38:16] the bride is called
[1:38:18] in that day the son of man will be
[1:38:19] revealed what to join the church
[1:38:21] to the head unite the marriage of the
[1:38:24] bride
[1:38:25] so we can say it was a son of man
[1:38:27] revealing the son of man but
[1:38:29] what was the purpose of that ministry
[1:38:32] and the purpose of that ministry was
[1:38:34] unite the bride
[1:38:35] with the head to combine them to
[1:38:38] together
[1:38:38] and if that invisible union hasn't taken
[1:38:41] place that ministry hasn't yet served
[1:38:43] its purpose
[1:38:46] let's bring it home amen if we've heard
[1:38:48] the ministry
[1:38:49] of brother branham the forerunner
[1:38:50] ministry and and we've listened to the
[1:38:53] tapes and we've heard the books
[1:38:54] but we have not yet that ministry has
[1:38:57] not yet united
[1:38:58] us with the bridegroom then that
[1:39:00] ministry has not yet fulfilled its
[1:39:02] purpose in our lives
[1:39:06] it wasn't to say god sent a prophet like
[1:39:08] god sent moses
[1:39:09] it wasn't so he could go up to the
[1:39:10] mountain and get the word and bring it
[1:39:11] to us
[1:39:12] the whole purpose was so he could take a
[1:39:14] bride and unite it to the head the body
[1:39:16] and the head together and if that hasn't
[1:39:19] happened
[1:39:19] the purpose of that ministry is not yet
[1:39:22] fulfilled in your life
[1:39:27] but i listen to the tapes every day but
[1:39:28] have you united with the headship
[1:39:31] are you in a marriage union with jesus
[1:39:33] christ have you become one with him have
[1:39:35] you received a new birth
[1:39:39] that's the purpose to join the church to
[1:39:41] the head unite the marriage of the bride
[1:39:43] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:39:45] through this when the son of man will
[1:39:47] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:39:48] unite the two together
[1:39:51] he's coming in human flesh the
[1:39:54] bridegroom the son of man
[1:39:55] christ himself is coming in human flesh
[1:39:57] what human flesh did he come in
[1:39:59] he was there in the prophet what was the
[1:40:03] prophet
[1:40:03] he was the veil over the seventh seal
[1:40:07] he was the mystery that had gotten
[1:40:08] caught up into the constellation of
[1:40:10] angels and come back
[1:40:12] and the revelation was hidden in him it
[1:40:14] was the coming of the son of man
[1:40:17] coming in flesh to unite the two
[1:40:18] together do we believe that then let's
[1:40:22] read on
[1:40:24] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:40:26] word the two unites together
[1:40:28] and to do that it'll take the
[1:40:30] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:40:32] son of man
[1:40:33] not a clergyman i don't know do you see
[1:40:35] what i mean
[1:40:36] see it's a it's son of man jesus christ
[1:40:40] will come down in human flesh among us
[1:40:42] and will make his word so real that
[1:40:44] it'll unite the church and him as one
[1:40:46] the bride and then shall go home to the
[1:40:48] wedding supper amen
[1:40:49] she's already united see we go to the
[1:40:52] wedding supper not to the marriage
[1:40:54] see fill yourself with yourself of the
[1:40:56] flesh of the mighty men because the
[1:40:57] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:40:59] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:41:00] supper when the word here unites with
[1:41:03] the person
[1:41:04] then they too become one and then what
[1:41:07] does it do then
[1:41:08] it manifests the son of man again not
[1:41:11] church theologians the son of man
[1:41:15] the word and the church becomes
[1:41:18] one whatever the son of man done he was
[1:41:21] the word the church does the same thing
[1:41:24] now now let's dial in dial in
[1:41:27] i know we've preached a long time and
[1:41:28] you're tired but let's dial it right in
[1:41:31] the son of man came
[1:41:33] right down in human flesh
[1:41:37] and brother branham was the veil that
[1:41:38] was veiling the seventh seal
[1:41:41] his whole ministry was the seventh seal
[1:41:43] he was the messenger of the seventh seal
[1:41:46] he was the end time messenger with the
[1:41:48] end time seal
[1:41:51] the coming of the son of man in the
[1:41:53] revealing of the son of man
[1:41:54] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:41:56] christ coming into human flesh
[1:41:58] god almighty coming down to reveal the
[1:42:02] word
[1:42:03] to so reveal the word that will unite
[1:42:06] the head and the body together in an
[1:42:09] invisible union of marriage union
[1:42:12] we got that we all believe that to
[1:42:15] do what what was the purpose of that
[1:42:21] say i'm married i'm married i'm married
[1:42:23] married mary
[1:42:28] to manifest the son of man again
[1:42:32] he came in flesh and the prophet to
[1:42:34] manifest the son of man
[1:42:35] to make the word so real that he would
[1:42:37] unite the head and body together
[1:42:39] in an invisible unit to do what so that
[1:42:41] she would become impregnated by the word
[1:42:43] so when she become pregnated by the word
[1:42:45] what would she do she would produce the
[1:42:47] son of man
[1:42:48] again and now the mystery of the seventh
[1:42:51] seal lives
[1:42:52] on it's behind the veil of badger skins
[1:42:56] is behind the skin of the bride and
[1:42:58] there's people walking around with the
[1:42:59] veil over their heart but if they would
[1:43:01] ever get into christ he would take the
[1:43:03] veil away and they would recognize
[1:43:05] that it's the son of man in his bride
[1:43:09] making the word live i mean the bride
[1:43:11] word the portion of the word that
[1:43:13] pertains to the bride
[1:43:14] living today in human flesh your flesh
[1:43:18] and my flesh what is it it's a
[1:43:21] manifestation of the son of man
[1:43:23] christ is here it is the bride coming of
[1:43:26] christ
[1:43:26] amen when he came to and when he came as
[1:43:28] a forerunner
[1:43:29] he had to do two things john the baptist
[1:43:32] had to look at this vessel and say i saw
[1:43:34] the dove coming down on this vessel
[1:43:37] right he had to announce jesus christ
[1:43:39] coming but now there's another
[1:43:41] forerunner comes
[1:43:42] and he's got to do what he's got to
[1:43:44] point out a word born bride
[1:43:45] because there's no reason for the
[1:43:46] bridegroom to come until there's a bride
[1:43:48] here for them to unite with
[1:43:50] there's no reason for the head to come
[1:43:51] until there's a body present for the
[1:43:53] head to rest on
[1:43:54] so he's got to come and he's got to show
[1:43:56] the resting place
[1:43:58] where the headship of the revealed word
[1:44:00] is going to rest
[1:44:01] when it comes down and it's going to
[1:44:03] rest on the body
[1:44:05] on the church on the bride so there has
[1:44:07] to be a uniting
[1:44:09] so he's got to point out a word born
[1:44:11] bride and he's got to point her to the
[1:44:14] skies
[1:44:15] and say turn it to the right
[1:44:18] it'll take him to show you the right
[1:44:20] angle in this cloud
[1:44:23] what's he doing he's pointing to the
[1:44:25] skies
[1:44:26] saying behold the lamb the one who
[1:44:30] has a right to take the book and loose
[1:44:31] the seven seals thereof
[1:44:34] and unite the two together and guess
[1:44:37] what
[1:44:38] now god can take that prophet messenger
[1:44:42] and he can take him home
[1:44:47] because the transfer has been made
[1:44:50] the the uniting has come
[1:44:53] and now the seventh seal is still on
[1:44:56] earth
[1:44:59] in a veil and it's veiled
[1:45:02] and the life is shining so bright
[1:45:05] there's people walking around that have
[1:45:06] to have a veil on their heart
[1:45:08] amen because the light is so blinding
[1:45:11] all they see
[1:45:12] is thick darkness but once you come
[1:45:14] inside the light of the bright coming of
[1:45:16] christ
[1:45:16] amen when you step beyond the thick
[1:45:18] darkness you see the shekinah glory of
[1:45:20] god
[1:45:21] and the word lightens up for you
[1:45:26] praise be to god friends
[1:45:29] questions and answers on the seals
[1:45:31] questions and answers on the seals
[1:45:35] with the bride of christ would the bride
[1:45:37] of christ have a ministry before the
[1:45:38] rapture
[1:45:39] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:45:42] the bride of christ certainly it's the
[1:45:44] message of the hour the bride of christ
[1:45:46] sure
[1:45:46] she's consisted of apostles prophets
[1:45:48] teachers evangelists and pastors is that
[1:45:50] right
[1:45:51] that's the bride of christ sure she's
[1:45:52] got a ministry a great ministry it's the
[1:45:54] ministry of the hour
[1:45:56] it'll be so humble
[1:46:00] what will it look like it'll look like
[1:46:02] that guy sitting next to you
[1:46:05] and most of you are saying that's pretty
[1:46:10] humble
[1:46:13] what is it there's still a veil on the
[1:46:15] seventh seal
[1:46:17] but that veil is taken away in christ
[1:46:22] brother chad i just don't see it keep
[1:46:24] climbing the mountain
[1:46:27] i just can't seem to grasp it just keep
[1:46:29] climbing the mountain
[1:46:30] if something in you tells you this
[1:46:31] message is true keep feeding
[1:46:34] keep feeding keep feeding keep listening
[1:46:37] keep feeding because at the top of the
[1:46:39] mountain you're going to unite with him
[1:46:41] how will it happen i don't know when
[1:46:43] will happen i don't know but you just
[1:46:44] keep climbing don't be afraid of the
[1:46:46] thick darkness don't be afraid of the
[1:46:48] confusing statement
[1:46:49] don't be afraid of the terms once you
[1:46:51] get past that thick darkness it lightens
[1:46:53] up friends
[1:46:57] resume of the ages the brother of them
[1:47:00] says i sincerely believe that the spirit
[1:47:02] of god has been speaking to us not only
[1:47:03] teaching
[1:47:04] as the truths of the age but has been
[1:47:06] faithfully dealing with the hearts that
[1:47:08] they may turn to him
[1:47:09] that is the reason for all preaching and
[1:47:11] teaching
[1:47:12] for it is in the preaching and teaching
[1:47:14] of the word that the sheep
[1:47:16] hear the voice of god and follow him
[1:47:21] what are we doing we're sounding out his
[1:47:24] voice
[1:47:26] what are they hearing not the voice of
[1:47:28] the preacher or the teacher but
[1:47:30] the voice of god if it's the true word
[1:47:33] of god by the revelation of the hour
[1:47:36] it's the true word of god going forth
[1:47:37] it's the voice of god
[1:47:41] brother brahm says i'm just going to
[1:47:42] read a couple more quotes and we're
[1:47:43] going to be done
[1:47:45] but the man says in out of the church
[1:47:47] age book the later season church age
[1:47:49] a momentary consideration of church
[1:47:51] history will prove how accurate this
[1:47:53] thought is
[1:47:55] the dark ages the word was almost
[1:47:56] entirely lost to the people
[1:47:58] but god sent luther with the word the
[1:48:01] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:48:05] can a lutheran speak for god
[1:48:12] he knows he said at that time
[1:48:18] they had the fresh manna that came from
[1:48:20] heaven
[1:48:22] it came to luther luther was the
[1:48:25] messenger of the age
[1:48:26] luther spoke it out when others caught
[1:48:28] up by revelation and they started
[1:48:30] teaching and preaching and speaking it
[1:48:32] they became the voice of god
[1:48:36] do you get it this is just church ages
[1:48:42] lutheran spoke for god at that time but
[1:48:43] they organized and again the pure word
[1:48:45] was
[1:48:46] lost for organization tense toward
[1:48:48] dogman creeds and not simple word
[1:48:50] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:48:52] god sent wesley
[1:48:53] and he was the voice with the word in
[1:48:55] his day
[1:48:57] the people who took his revelation from
[1:48:59] god became the living epistles read and
[1:49:01] known of all men for their generation
[1:49:04] see it always produced the living word
[1:49:06] for that day
[1:49:07] caught from a messenger master gave it
[1:49:09] to the people the people took it in and
[1:49:10] they spoke for god
[1:49:11] and they become the living word in their
[1:49:13] day and it happened age after age after
[1:49:16] age after
[1:49:17] age goes on to say
[1:49:22] when the methodist failed god raised up
[1:49:24] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:49:25] years until the last day
[1:49:27] there is again another people in the
[1:49:29] land who under their messenger will be
[1:49:31] the final voice
[1:49:32] to the final age
[1:49:35] what voice her voice
[1:49:40] his voice
[1:49:44] yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:49:46] mouthpiece of god
[1:49:48] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[1:49:50] turning on her he will confound her
[1:49:51] through the prophet and the bride
[1:49:54] for the voice of god will be in
[1:49:57] her
[1:50:02] so when you talk make your voice deeper
[1:50:09] it's not he's talking about it's the
[1:50:12] word
[1:50:13] god is the word christ is the word made
[1:50:16] manifest the anointed word for the hour
[1:50:18] when you speak the true word of god you
[1:50:22] are presenting you are the voice
[1:50:24] it's the voice of god through your voice
[1:50:25] coming through it doesn't matter if it's
[1:50:27] a high tone a low tone if it's soft if
[1:50:29] it's deep
[1:50:30] it doesn't matter what the what the
[1:50:33] vocal cords are sounding
[1:50:34] what matters is the revelation that's
[1:50:36] coming off those vocal cords
[1:50:38] and it is the voice of god
[1:50:41] when it is the word of god
[1:50:49] for the voice of god will be in her yes
[1:50:51] it is for it says in the last chapter of
[1:50:53] revelation verse 17
[1:50:54] the spirit and the bride say come once
[1:50:57] more
[1:50:57] the world will hear direct from god as
[1:51:00] at pentecost
[1:51:03] i want to hear from god
[1:51:11] then why didn't you come to church today
[1:51:19] i want to go out into the woods i want
[1:51:22] to get all quiet by myself
[1:51:25] and i want to hear direct from god
[1:51:28] the brother of said his voice was in the
[1:51:30] woods
[1:51:32] and the last day is his voice will be in
[1:51:35] her
[1:51:39] i'm not saying god don't speak to your
[1:51:40] nature you understand what i'm saying
[1:51:43] so many times we go looking in the wrong
[1:51:45] direction in the wrong place
[1:51:47] but he said there will be a people who
[1:51:49] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:51:51] this god's voice will be in her
[1:51:54] that's what he says he says once more
[1:51:57] the world will hear direct
[1:51:59] from god i want to hear it for direct
[1:52:01] from god
[1:52:02] well once more the world is hearing
[1:52:04] direct from god and is the voice that is
[1:52:06] coming through his bride
[1:52:09] we are direct from god is at pentecost
[1:52:11] but of course that word bride will be
[1:52:13] repudiated as in the first
[1:52:14] age later further down in later scene
[1:52:18] churches he says oh god still has a
[1:52:19] voice for the people of the world
[1:52:22] even as he has given a voice to the
[1:52:23] bride that voice is in the bride as we
[1:52:26] have said
[1:52:27] and we will talk more about that later
[1:52:30] so the people of the world
[1:52:31] there's been a voice given to the people
[1:52:33] of the world
[1:52:35] is that true where's that voice coming
[1:52:38] from
[1:52:39] if it's not coming from it's bright it's
[1:52:40] coming from us we have to be that voice
[1:52:43] we have to be the living written epistle
[1:52:45] read in our written in our hearts
[1:52:47] read by all men by our lives and by our
[1:52:49] speech and by our preaching and by our
[1:52:51] teaching it all has to say the same
[1:52:52] thing
[1:52:53] our whole life what we teach what we
[1:52:55] speak what we preach what we wear
[1:52:56] where we go all has to be the voice of
[1:52:58] god to this age
[1:53:06] oh man praise god
[1:53:09] we're running out of time
[1:53:12] but god help us we're going to wrap up
[1:53:17] i don't want to go too far
[1:53:22] brother brahman says and further in the
[1:53:24] latest in church age
[1:53:28] but thank god at this moment this age is
[1:53:30] not over he is yet crying
[1:53:32] and his cries not only in the spiritual
[1:53:34] ears of men but his spirit
[1:53:35] but once again a prophet is in the land
[1:53:38] once more god will reveal the truth as
[1:53:39] he did to paul
[1:53:40] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[1:53:42] the days of the later seeing age
[1:53:44] its messenger will reveal the mysteries
[1:53:45] of god as revealed to paul
[1:53:47] he will speak out and those who receive
[1:53:49] the prophet in his own name will receive
[1:53:51] the benefit
[1:53:54] the beneficent effect of that prophet's
[1:53:56] ministry
[1:53:57] and they that hear him will be blessed
[1:53:59] and become part of that bride of the
[1:54:01] last day
[1:54:01] who are mentioned in revelation 22 17
[1:54:04] and the spirit
[1:54:05] and the bride say come the corner of
[1:54:09] wheat the bride wheat that fell into the
[1:54:10] ground at night see has come back to
[1:54:12] original word grain again
[1:54:14] praise god forever yes listen to the
[1:54:15] authenticated prophet of god
[1:54:17] who appears in the last age what he says
[1:54:20] from god the bride will say
[1:54:24] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:54:27] will be saying the same thing
[1:54:32] we'll be saying the same thing and what
[1:54:34] they will say will have already been
[1:54:35] said in the word
[1:54:37] they are saying it now come out from
[1:54:38] among her now and be separate
[1:54:40] the cry has gone out the cry is going
[1:54:42] out how long will the voice cry
[1:54:44] we do not know but one thing we do know
[1:54:46] it won't be long
[1:54:48] for this is the last age
[1:54:51] there's a cry going on in the land but
[1:54:53] it's going out from where
[1:54:55] from his bride see it's not
[1:54:59] the flesh the flesh is the veil
[1:55:02] but what's behind the veil what's behind
[1:55:05] the veil is the mystery of the seventh
[1:55:06] seal
[1:55:08] the end time the end time mystery
[1:55:11] message the end time seal the coming of
[1:55:14] the lord
[1:55:15] where is it where is the coming of the
[1:55:17] lord where is the end time seal
[1:55:19] why can i put my hands on it can i put
[1:55:21] it in a book can i diagram it on paper
[1:55:26] that mystery was alive in that prophet
[1:55:30] and that mystery is alive and you and me
[1:55:33] where is the end time seal it's behind
[1:55:36] badger skins
[1:55:38] where is the seventh seal i'm waiting
[1:55:40] for it
[1:55:43] it's all around you it's all around you
[1:55:46] don't miss it it's the seventh seal
[1:55:50] hidden the son of man coming through a
[1:55:53] bride
[1:55:54] already did it in one man already did in
[1:55:57] the prophet already did in the
[1:55:58] forerunner the forerunners pointed it
[1:56:00] out
[1:56:00] and now what he pointed to has united
[1:56:02] with the head ship and now the head is
[1:56:03] here united to bride to display his own
[1:56:05] life
[1:56:07] and it is the seventh seal how do i get
[1:56:09] there
[1:56:10] get caught up into that headshot be the
[1:56:13] little mystery rock
[1:56:16] the little white rock of a new name
[1:56:19] caught up into the constellation of
[1:56:21] angels the mysteries known only to them
[1:56:24] and let god reveal who this is to your
[1:56:26] heart
[1:56:28] and come back off the mountain
[1:56:31] veiled with a shining bright life
[1:56:36] nobody knows what's behind the veil
[1:56:39] until they go behind the veil
[1:56:43] what are we here to do portray jesus
[1:56:45] christ
[1:56:47] we're here to live for him
[1:56:50] let's all stand read one quote musicians
[1:56:53] if you come
[1:57:01] yeah let's read this last quote together
[1:57:05] while you're standing now if there are
[1:57:07] those attributes of god we cannot live
[1:57:08] by creeds
[1:57:10] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:57:12] must live by the word
[1:57:14] because the bride is a part of the
[1:57:16] bridegroom
[1:57:17] like any wife is part of her husband
[1:57:19] therefore we must be the word bride
[1:57:21] and what is that word bride the
[1:57:24] manifestation of this
[1:57:25] hour the bride not a creed
[1:57:28] or denomination but a living oracle of
[1:57:31] god
[1:57:32] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:57:34] the world the attributes of god in the
[1:57:36] formation of the bride
[1:57:37] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:57:40] we're now living
[1:57:42] and if we can't see him in that
[1:57:46] then we can't see him in this hour i
[1:57:52] hope
[1:57:52] i hope that hits home if we can't see
[1:57:55] him
[1:57:56] behind the veil then we haven't been
[1:58:00] behind the veil
[1:58:02] but if we go into christ the veil over
[1:58:05] our heart
[1:58:06] will be taken away and when we behold
[1:58:09] him
[1:58:09] face to face this is not
[1:58:12] another person the second person a third
[1:58:14] person it is the
[1:58:15] person it is the son of man whatever was
[1:58:18] in that prophet now
[1:58:20] through an invisible union is in you and
[1:58:21] i
[1:58:23] and there's another voice on this earth
[1:58:26] and what
[1:58:26] the voice the spirit and the and the
[1:58:28] prophet and the bride will all be
[1:58:30] saying the same
[1:58:33] is that true why because they have the
[1:58:35] revelation of the mystery
[1:58:40] not titled this don't be afraid of the
[1:58:42] voice
[1:58:43] don't be afraid of his voice
[1:58:46] don't be afraid of his voice
[1:58:50] see
[1:58:54] we can still be afraid of his voice
[1:58:58] because we don't trust where it's coming
[1:59:00] from
[1:59:03] because now his voice is where
[1:59:07] in the bride and
[1:59:10] i just want to go to a tape
[1:59:16] i just want to stay behind the barrier
[1:59:19] i just want somebody else to go up and
[1:59:21] come down i just want to stay in my pew
[1:59:23] and let the preacher make the journey
[1:59:26] you see what i was saying at the
[1:59:27] beginning i want to bring it right here
[1:59:28] now
[1:59:30] the same thing i said about horeb
[1:59:31] applies right now
[1:59:33] his voice is in his bride his bride is
[1:59:35] united to them where
[1:59:36] in the top of mount zion and the
[1:59:38] thunders and the lightnings and the
[1:59:40] earthquakes and the voices
[1:59:42] and he's come down in his headship to
[1:59:44] unite with the body at the top of the
[1:59:46] mountain
[1:59:47] at the top at the end of the church ages
[1:59:50] and now his voice is in her
[1:59:54] don't be afraid of his voice
[1:59:58] just because it's coming from her
[2:00:03] it's important friends it's more
[2:00:05] important than you may realize
[2:00:09] so many times we don't want to accept
[2:00:11] something
[2:00:13] because of the sound of the voice that
[2:00:14] speaks it or because the place it comes
[2:00:17] from
[2:00:19] but his voice is in his bride
[2:00:23] remember we went to revelations chapter
[2:00:28] i don't know chapter something where the
[2:00:30] angel takes the golden read and measures
[2:00:32] the city
[2:00:34] but then you go to revelation chapter 11
[2:00:35] and john's given a read
[2:00:38] and john measures the temple
[2:00:41] and the altar and those that worship
[2:00:43] there
[2:00:46] i can take it from the angel
[2:00:50] but can i take it from john
[2:00:55] do you see what i'm saying i can take it
[2:00:59] from the angel when the angel says it
[2:01:02] but when that angel gave a rod
[2:01:06] the angel gave a rod to john and told
[2:01:08] john to go measure it
[2:01:11] now john knows the measurement of it
[2:01:17] that's the scriptures i'm not afraid to
[2:01:20] take it from the angel
[2:01:22] but don't be afraid to take it from john
[2:01:24] either
[2:01:26] as long as the spirit and the prophet
[2:01:29] and the bride are saying the same thing
[2:01:33] as long as that bride is under her
[2:01:35] messenger for that age
[2:01:37] under her messenger she's the final
[2:01:39] voice to the final age if she gets out
[2:01:40] from under that she's no longer the
[2:01:42] final voice but under her messenger the
[2:01:44] final voice to the final age
[2:01:46] don't be afraid of his voice just
[2:01:48] because it's coming from his
[2:01:50] bride
[2:01:53] that's a big statement because when
[2:01:56] brother branham
[2:01:57] taught what paul taught
[2:02:01] he didn't just repeat verbatim
[2:02:03] everything paul said
[2:02:06] is that right he didn't just repeat
[2:02:09] verbatim everything paul said
[2:02:11] but he caught the revelation of what
[2:02:12] paul said and he preached it
[2:02:14] and brother branham could use his own
[2:02:16] bible verses
[2:02:18] to preach what paul preached
[2:02:23] and if the brides received the same
[2:02:25] revelation brother branham received
[2:02:26] brother graham said i don't have time
[2:02:29] to preach these seals he said i don't
[2:02:32] have time
[2:02:33] we'd go all through the bible it goes
[2:02:35] from genesis to revelation
[2:02:36] we go around and around that clock is
[2:02:38] those things he said
[2:02:40] we don't have time i'm just hitting the
[2:02:42] high spots
[2:02:43] just so you can see what it is but if we
[2:02:45] caught the same revelation
[2:02:46] then the bride can do the same thing if
[2:02:48] she's got the revelation she can take
[2:02:50] the bible
[2:02:51] and she can go and find those seven seal
[2:02:53] mysteries all through the entire bible
[2:02:55] and don't be afraid of the measurement
[2:02:57] just because the bride used the reed to
[2:02:59] make
[2:03:00] the measurement because his voice is in
[2:03:02] her
[2:03:03] and she has to be saying the same thing
[2:03:05] he said
[2:03:06] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:03:08] have to say the same thing
[2:03:10] but they don't have to just repeat
[2:03:12] verbatim i don't just stand and read
[2:03:14] this quote let's go to this quote let's
[2:03:16] read this bible verse
[2:03:17] what's the point of preaching just play
[2:03:19] tapes
[2:03:20] [Applause]
[2:03:22] amen but god has given this revelation
[2:03:25] and the part that the prophet didn't
[2:03:26] have time to dig down and get out he's
[2:03:28] given the revelation to the bride
[2:03:30] and she can go into this word and dig
[2:03:32] out all of those beautiful truths
[2:03:36] don't be afraid of his voice because i
[2:03:39] tell you
[2:03:40] revelations 22 the end of the book
[2:03:45] who's the one calling
[2:03:50] the spirit and the bride say come
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:55] come and him that's thirsty let him come
[2:03:57] amen a drink of the water of life
[2:04:00] freely you know what that means that
[2:04:02] means
[2:04:03] wherever that wherever somebody needs to
[2:04:07] come
[2:04:09] to have the water of life the bride's
[2:04:12] already there
[2:04:14] she's not saying go go up that mountain
[2:04:16] go to that place turn right here
[2:04:18] there's a brook over there water life's
[2:04:20] there she's saying come
[2:04:21] if you're thirsty come why because the
[2:04:24] water of life is flowing right through
[2:04:25] the tree of life amen
[2:04:27] and there's tree of life was on either
[2:04:29] side of the river male and female jesus
[2:04:31] christ misses jesus christ and the world
[2:04:33] river of life was flowing right between
[2:04:36] the two
[2:04:36] she's right there with christ on the top
[2:04:39] of the mountain
[2:04:40] where the river of life is flowing from
[2:04:42] the throne and she's saying
[2:04:43] come and drink come and drink come and
[2:04:45] drink come and drink and if you're
[2:04:47] scared of that voice
[2:04:48] you'll run away
[2:04:52] and stand afar off and say
[2:04:56] i want moses to go and drink
[2:05:01] moses moses moses moses moses
[2:05:06] moses this and moses this and moses this
[2:05:10] when jesus christ came to them they were
[2:05:12] still leaning
[2:05:13] on moses
[2:05:16] amen the same one that they would have
[2:05:18] united with
[2:05:20] on the top of the mountain came down in
[2:05:21] flesh is jesus christ
[2:05:23] and he was standing in their midst and
[2:05:24] he was saying if anybody's thirsty he
[2:05:26] let him come into me
[2:05:27] and they're still saying moses moses
[2:05:29] moses said moses as moses told us
[2:05:35] i'm telling you the same things
[2:05:37] repeating today
[2:05:40] don't let it repeat in you and i i want
[2:05:43] to unite with him
[2:05:44] i want to go to the top of that mountain
[2:05:46] i want to drink from that fountain
[2:05:47] myself
[2:05:48] and when i drink from that fountain i
[2:05:49] want to become the fountain till out of
[2:05:51] my belly flow rivers of living water
[2:05:53] and i can say come and drink where's the
[2:05:56] voice it's here

[2:06:04] i mean there's no denomination there's
[2:06:06] no other baptist doctrine there's no one
[2:06:08] it's just the message of the hour in the
[2:06:10] bride of jesus christ that's the only
[2:06:12] place where this fountain is flowing
[2:06:14] it's the only well that's open in the
[2:06:17] house of david
[2:06:20] don't be afraid of that voice just
[2:06:22] because it's now speaking out of
[2:06:24] feminine form
[2:06:26] it's the same voice that spoke the
[2:06:27] commandments on the mountain it's the
[2:06:29] same one that spoke the thunders
[2:06:31] and the same one as the son of man now
[2:06:34] bottled
[2:06:35] and confined is that what the prophet
[2:06:38] said
[2:06:39] bottled and confined in the bride
[2:06:44] voice don't be afraid of it let me know

[2:06:56] and let him take the veil off of your
[2:06:57] heart
[2:06:58] till you can see him in every verse and
