TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you could see now how cain could be justified by the mercy of god cain could feel justified like he was correct because god agreed with his protest gave him protection put a mark upon him to protect him and then he goes out and seemingly the curse takes no effect because now he begins to establish civilization in cities and now it looks as though what god said now it looks as though his protest changed the entire mind of god but god was not looking at stability and security in the carnal sense the same way cain was looking at it he was looking at security and stability coming from those by revelation would be attached to his word and that would be the security and that would be their steadiness and that would be their protection and cain would never have that stability he would always wonder from doctrine to doctrine and man's idea to man's idea and new god to new god another idea to other idea amen but the children of god would have the word of god as stability and security because they would have it by revelation so he was a vagabond amen and he was a fugitive and a vagabond outside the presence of god amen where where seth's line they begin to call on the name of god says line at the same time they begin to call upon the name of god amen they were not listen they were not just saying there's a god amen it wasn't as though cain continued to worship cain continued to be religious cain continued to worship god but he worshiped god his way and he became unstable in that worship he became faltering and teetering and wandering and now he would incorporate other gods and begin to worship son and worship moon amen and worship other things and then he began to make idols what was he he was unstable he was a fugitive in a bag of vagabond outside the presence of god and he continued to worship god but he worshiped the god of his own heart his own imagination of his own design but seth began to call upon the name of the lord he didn't want to worship god he wanted to know god
