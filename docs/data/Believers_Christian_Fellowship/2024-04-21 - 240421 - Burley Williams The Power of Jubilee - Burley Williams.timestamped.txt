[28:50] we should be excited amen we just thank
[28:53] God for for the CH allowing us to come
[28:56] by your way this morning and uh we just
[29:00] uh going to look into the word um I
[29:03] would like to uh just invite you to turn
[29:06] into the scriptures I'm not too good of
[29:09] an introductory person when I get
[29:12] something scriptures in my mind I try to
[29:15] just get into it quick so it won't
[29:18] leave so if you will let's turn to uh
[29:21] Leviticus chapter
[29:23] 25 and
[29:26] uh uh I want to
[29:29] brother Franco change that title brother
[29:31] uh I just want to if I can just preach
[29:34] on the power of
[29:38] Jubilee the power of Jubilee I might uh
[29:43] have a different approach but it's the
[29:45] same
[29:46] Revelation and uh that's one thing I
[29:49] learned in this time to preach a
[29:52] appreciate a minister for what he is cuz
[29:55] we're all different
[29:58] true and it don't got so sad around the
[30:00] message that you have to be put in
[30:03] categories now that's very sad amen
[30:07] because uh a Ministry is not for
[30:10] themselves it gifts is for the
[30:13] bride and and God that's what God give
[30:16] the gifts for us for the Perfection
[30:18] perfecting of the church perfecting of
[30:20] the Saints and uh he got different ways
[30:23] and different that's why it's a
[30:24] five-fold Ministry cuz we got different
[30:26] angles
[30:28] way we look at things but it should be a
[30:30] respect
[30:31] there can we say praise the Lord it
[30:34] should be a respect the Evangelist can't
[30:37] the Evangelist can't say the teacher
[30:39] should have screamed a little
[30:42] louder the teacher can't say the
[30:44] Evangelist the Evangelist should have
[30:45] went a little
[30:47] deeper that's wrong you got to respect
[30:50] them for exactly what they
[30:54] are praise the Lord uh let Leviticus 25:
[31:02] 23 he said the land the land shall not
[31:05] be sold forever for the land is mine for
[31:11] you are strangers and sojourners with me
[31:15] let us pray father we just want to thank
[31:17] you for the reading of your word and we
[31:20] just want to commit everything into our
[31:21] hands in the name of Jesus Christ we

[32:05] going to be myself either way I go I
[32:07] mean what I'm saying is sometimes uh
[32:10] people want to put you in a bottle or
[32:12] something and you ain't preaching like
[32:15] the other brother said stuff I'm now I'm
[32:18] I don't have a complex I'm over that
[32:20] I've been over that kind of stuff cuz I
[32:22] just going to be cuz you more effective
[32:26] if you just be exactly who you are amen
[32:28] right and however God uses you to speak
[32:31] just do it cuz the way God works
[32:34] sometimes you can preach you can preach
[32:37] you can preach and then feel like you
[32:39] ain't said
[32:42] nothing and that's when God did
[32:45] something then you can preach like you
[32:47] really done
[32:49] something then God didn't do nothing
[32:51] that's
[32:52] right praise the Lord sometime you can
[32:54] leave the pull pit defeated I'm telling
[32:57] y'all preacher
[32:59] Secrets man I just didn't get don't feel
[33:02] like I got nothing across and you talk
[33:04] to God I know what I studied Lord I I
[33:07] know what you gave me it just seemed
[33:09] like you beat yourself up right then
[33:13] somebody come to you brother that
[33:15] service You Preach really helped me you
[33:18] be like
[33:20] really that's because God done
[33:24] something and that's all you can do as a
[33:26] minister just you yourself to him cuz he
[33:29] knows all our
[33:32] needs would it be sad if every would it
[33:35] be sad if the congregation would call
[33:37] the pastor in the morning and say I need
[33:38] you to preach on this and this going on
[33:40] in my house and you know but it'll seem
[33:43] like there'll be a spiritual Pastor
[33:44] people like why he got
[33:46] discernment it don't work like that but
[33:50] God he knows
[33:52] everything praise the Lord and I thank
[33:55] and I thank him for that amen so uh uh I
[33:59] might do a little something uh a little
[34:02] different to the norm but it's for a
[34:06] purpose I'm not an
[34:08] Entertainer you know is I don't know who
[34:10] this preacher was but he made a
[34:12] statement he said the the uh he said the
[34:16] SEC secular singers has become the
[34:19] gospel singers the gospel singers has
[34:22] become the secular singers then he said
[34:25] the motivational speakers have become
[34:28] the preachers and the preachers have
[34:30] become the motivational
[34:32] speakers I said you owned something that
[34:34] was in uh
[34:37] 98 a preacher said that not a message
[34:40] preacher he said that and you can see it
[34:43] today praise the Lord you know we we we
[34:47] don't post to pre now I'm I'm going to
[34:49] say something but you can look it up
[34:52] yourself type in the message persuade
[34:55] and persuasion that's right just read
[34:57] them that's quotes and quotes and quot
[34:59] it's a s for for sway you're going to
[35:01] see 11 quotes and uh I I watched
[35:05] something that the prophet was saying
[35:07] about it uh you would hear him say may
[35:11] Lord I preach and persuade people he'll
[35:14] say that that's in the 50s then as it
[35:17] goes up he'll start talking about
[35:20] persuasion then he comes to a place that
[35:23] the days of persuasion is
[35:25] over then as he comes up he said it
[35:28] makes no different how much I persuade
[35:30] you if the word don't convict you amen
[35:35] ain't much in it so there's a sense of
[35:38] persuasion that we do Paul said he
[35:41] persuade man with persuade is also a
[35:44] influence can we say Amen but it goes
[35:47] both ways a bad influence can be a
[35:50] persuasion a good influence can be a
[35:52] persuasion because even God when God was
[35:55] talking to the host in heaven about Ahab
[35:58] falling he said who could I who could
[36:00] what can we do to cause him to fall a
[36:02] Spirit came up and said I persuade him
[36:05] yeah so there's a good persuasion
[36:07] there's a bad persuasion but I want to
[36:09] say this the most thing that we really
[36:12] need is not persuasive preaching but pre
[36:16] conviction
[36:17] preaching cuz when somebody is convicted
[36:20] you'll find the prophet said some come
[36:22] to the altar he said you come not by
[36:25] persuasion but you come by
[36:28] conviction and that's is very very
[36:30] important to have a conviction somebody
[36:32] can talk you into anything or persuade
[36:34] you influence you into something but if
[36:37] a conviction is not there it's not going
[36:39] to hold but when you are convicted about
[36:42] something ain't nothing going to talk
[36:44] you out of that cuz it's a true
[36:46] conviction that don't took place in your
[36:48] life amen now I believe well I know you
[36:53] know what Jubilee
[36:55] is I know you've been taught these
[36:57] things we've been taught these things we
[36:59] we we listen to them year after year
[37:02] after year but I myself were looking at
[37:05] some things about Jubilee and uh I
[37:08] couldn't find out Jubilee is
[37:12] predestination it's actually
[37:14] predestination because a jubilee is
[37:17] literally not for everybody that's
[37:20] right I'm like then when I begin to
[37:23] study these things when I see a jubilee
[37:25] is not for everybody then can I realize
[37:28] why they jubilee don't
[37:31] hold praise the Lord you can't separate
[37:34] Jubilee and atonement praise God they
[37:37] run
[37:38] together praise the lord well we'll just
[37:41] work our way to it I'm I'm glad you're
[37:43] thinking but I don't come to just throw
[37:46] something at you but I come to it's
[37:48] important because I believe this message
[37:51] is our Jubilee I believe the Holy Ghost
[37:55] is our Jubilee amen is for is to bring
[37:58] us out of bondage and everything that we
[38:01] have lost is for us to return and get it
[38:05] back praise the Lord now now we we just
[38:08] want to uh in the scripture that we read
[38:11] in Leviticus 25 which I got several
[38:13] quotes that I want to want to use now we
[38:16] know that there's a a it's called a year
[38:20] of release yes now we know there's a
[38:23] sevene year of release but when it come
[38:26] to the Jubilee It Go up to 50 years
[38:29] which is 7 * 7 which is 50 that is a
[38:32] jubilee right there's a there somewhat
[38:35] the same but yet there also differences
[38:38] inside of it that's right and uh we want
[38:40] to see these things in the scripture and
[38:42] in the message and one thing I like
[38:44] about this in uh Leviticus
[38:48] 25 God said the land shall not be so
[38:54] forever I want you to think about this
[38:56] he said the land shall not be sold
[38:58] forever but at this particular time they
[39:02] are not even in their promised
[39:06] land they ain't even got there yet why
[39:09] is God saying it in Leviticus then cuz
[39:12] he knew they was going to sell out he
[39:15] knew they was going to mess up he knew
[39:17] that but he had to put something there
[39:20] to make sure they get it
[39:23] back amen God knew you and I going to
[39:26] sell out on some things we have done it
[39:28] that's right that's why he predestinated
[39:30] us so those things will have to return
[39:33] back to us make no difference how long
[39:35] it is have to return so I say that to
[39:38] say this we as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[39:41] we don't
[39:43] lose we get everything back we might go
[39:46] through some dark times some dark
[39:47] Seasons what do that have to do with
[39:50] predestination what that got to do with
[39:52] the election we going to we going to
[39:53] come out on the
[39:55] [Music]
[39:56] end praise the Lord let me just say it's
[40:00] kind of humble cmer Spirit you know when
[40:03] you bu in the pool pit I had a brother
[40:05] tell me the other day he said brother
[40:07] I'm just behind the pull pit shaking and
[40:09] I'm nervous I said that's good he like I
[40:12] said yeah that's wonderful that's cuz
[40:14] whenever you get to a place you come out
[40:15] there comfortable we in
[40:17] trouble now you're relying on
[40:20] yourself cu the longer you stay nervous
[40:22] that let me know you you trusting in the
[40:25] Lord and you don't want to say nothing
[40:27] out of terms you and and away from the
[40:30] word I so you're in a good State praise
[40:33] the Lord I don't never want to come up
[40:34] here I got
[40:35] this oh I'm going to really let no I
[40:39] promise you you come up like that you'll
[40:40] go down humble cuz God won't do nothing
[40:44] that's why we come and just say Lord
[40:46] whatever you want I just want to preach
[40:49] whatever you give me just let me preach
[40:50] it and and and it's
[40:53] wonderful you
[40:54] know I've been on a little thing
[40:57] uh too about
[41:00] Harmony and unity lately myself because
[41:05] you know you can see a lot of things
[41:07] what the prophet says about Harmony and
[41:09] Harmony and
[41:11] unity uh they sound like the same word
[41:14] somewh have certain certain meanings as
[41:17] the same but actually it's a difference
[41:20] that's
[41:21] right and I just like to use a little
[41:24] little little allergy not allergy
[41:27] allegory or whatever you want to put it
[41:30] I always uh I like to put it in the
[41:32] state of people living in a
[41:36] subdivision anybody live in a
[41:39] subdivision you know when you live in a
[41:44] subdivision it's a spirit
[41:48] there could be not saying good or bad
[41:50] just just it's a spirit it's a Spirit of
[41:54] Harmony right you know and you're in
[41:58] you're in your subdivision some of them
[41:59] gated communities and so forth and and
[42:02] then you know you walking down the road
[42:04] and the neighbor walking down the road
[42:06] got their dog and you got your dog Hey
[42:08] Joe hey how you doing Raph good old
[42:11] harmony right get on Harmony hey then
[42:15] everybody they know everybody name hey
[42:17] how you doing Harmony you know in the
[42:19] subdivision you got to keep your grass
[42:22] cut you don't keep your grass cut and
[42:25] then then you get out there let me cut
[42:28] the grass cuz I don't want to hear that
[42:29] mouth keep your trim your head just
[42:32] trimmed got your crime watch signs and
[42:34] all that kind of stuff that's some
[42:36] beautiful Harmony man isn't it and then
[42:39] you know uh uh a strange car come in the
[42:42] neighborhood and all of a sudden do you
[42:45] do you you see that car yeah then all of
[42:47] a sudden you can see
[42:50] blinds people looking you know that's a
[42:53] good thing something strange happening
[42:55] in the neighborhood and and uh
[42:57] that's a good Harmony right but yet
[43:02] that's not
[43:04] Unity that's Harmony that's not Unity
[43:08] cuz in that same subdivision you got
[43:11] Pentecostals you got Baptists message
[43:13] Believers apostolics so if you was in
[43:17] unity all of you would be believing the
[43:19] same thing but that's
[43:23] Harmony special election Time by iding
[43:27] sign Trump sign different yards so
[43:30] where's the unity there is none there
[43:32] just Harmony then you find out in
[43:34] election time how really good your
[43:36] neighbor actually
[43:38] are when one talk about
[43:40] Trump what happened to hey Ral hey
[43:44] stress right amen so that's not unity in
[43:51] that same subdivision of Baptist could
[43:53] come and tell you my wife been promoted
[43:54] on the job will you yes oh yes of I'm so
[43:57] happy for you we going to have a little
[43:59] party for come on over and join us we
[44:01] going to have a little wine you go no so
[44:05] now you don't broke y'all so-called
[44:07] Harmony look at you think you different
[44:09] than us see it's no Unity cuz if it a
[44:12] Unity you would be believing the same
[44:16] thing see God want us to be in united
[44:20] with him unified with him by what the
[44:24] word can we say Amen now brother Ram
[44:27] says this he says
[44:30] uh uh he Jesus one day hit a
[44:34] crowd he said he just took a man by his
[44:36] hand and led him outside of the city
[44:39] spit on the ground made mud put it on
[44:41] his eyes and told him to go wash and the
[44:44] next day he come
[44:45] seeing he said he went into a place
[44:47] where they were all screaming on the can
[44:49] of a little girl that just died laughing
[44:51] at him cuz he said she wasn't dead he
[44:54] put them everyone out of the house went
[44:57] in he see you got to have
[45:01] Unity Harmony everything in one
[45:05] Accord then the Holy Spirit should never
[45:08] have to be one prayer here on the
[45:10] platform he going to another Direction
[45:12] but I want to point out what he said
[45:14] they all have to work together Unity
[45:17] Harmony and everything in one
[45:21] Accord there's a degree we can be in
[45:23] harmony with each other on certain
[45:25] things but God won't us to be unified
[45:28] and that's only way that's going to
[45:30] happen is by the
[45:33] word we can have disagreements about
[45:35] something amen still be friends but when
[45:39] we can be unified with one another we'll
[45:41] take the word of God say let's look and
[45:43] see what the message says let's put our
[45:46] thoughts completely out of it and just
[45:48] see what God is saying that'll bring us
[45:50] into a
[45:51] Unity can we say Amen you see that's why
[45:57] even in uh house Life Family
[46:01] Life when your children is raised up
[46:05] they are in harmony with you but if they
[46:08] are not born again they are not in unity
[46:10] with
[46:12] you some of you
[46:14] like praise the Lord they in harmony
[46:17] they that's Mom that's my dad so I
[46:21] respect them I love him that's good
[46:24] Harmony but then when Mom and Dad take
[46:26] them to to the word and say you know you
[46:28] can't do this because of the word they
[46:29] be like I I I I just feel like I should
[46:32] live my own life I I I I don't I can't
[46:34] follow that see there's no Unity if that
[46:38] child had the Holy Spirit and that would
[46:40] y'all could be unified by the word that
[46:42] brings a unity in the family so we can
[46:45] harmony with one another but what about
[46:47] Unity same as
[46:50] marriage do you want Harmony in your
[46:53] marriage
[46:54] only we want Harmony in
[46:58] unity see in Harmony in a marriage you
[47:01] can say that's my wife that's my husband
[47:03] I love her and we just love each other
[47:05] wonderful that's great but when it start
[47:08] having family structure and so forth
[47:11] then uh the husband say one thing the
[47:15] children can do then the wife say one
[47:17] thing the children can do and then when
[47:20] they tell the child I wouldn't let you
[47:21] do that I would let you do it you know
[47:24] mama going to let you mama would
[47:27] but Daddy you you know how daddy is so I
[47:32] can't let you do it that's not
[47:35] Unity but Unity is when Mom and Daddy
[47:38] saying the exact same thing by the word
[47:40] of God daddy say no mama say no then you
[47:44] say children no because the word of God
[47:46] said no we're not doing it that's the
[47:49] unity can we say praise the Lord so we
[47:52] want to be unified with the word uh some
[47:55] ministers get little offended with me
[47:58] you know I love ministers meeting and
[48:00] stuff I said well it's a ministers
[48:01] meeting I said but most of them is
[48:03] harmony meetings it's cuz you leave the
[48:05] minister meeting a accomplish nothing in
[48:07] the word but just good ideas no if it's
[48:10] going to be a minister meeting let's be
[48:12] unified around the word see what the
[48:14] prophet said see what the scripture said
[48:16] and leave it at
[48:21] that he told me take my Liberty
[48:25] brother these things are
[48:27] important very important in this day and
[48:31] time praise the Lord now
[48:35] jubile I just love
[48:38] this when God said the land shall not be
[48:40] sold
[48:41] forever for the land is mine God let
[48:46] them know this is my land but we but he
[48:50] told Abraham I'm giving you this land
[48:53] and your children this land right but
[48:55] God said it's
[48:57] mind it's kind of can put it to you in a
[48:59] parable like this it's just like if you
[49:02] give your child a car but you got the
[49:05] title amen you got the title then the
[49:08] son that decide I'm going to get rid of
[49:10] this car get me another one then he come
[49:12] home you say what where's that car he oh
[49:15] I just got rid of it you know what that
[49:16] pan can do he got that title he can go
[49:19] down there who you sold it to he can go
[49:21] down there and say give me that car back
[49:23] that man say no yo this guy sold this to
[49:25] me he said yeah that gu is my son but I
[49:28] got the title now you give it back to me
[49:31] can we say Amen don't you realize this
[49:34] kind of what this is God said this land
[49:36] is mine and it ain't going to be sold
[49:38] forever it got to come back to me but I
[49:40] look at it more than just natural land
[49:43] this land is also God's land so that
[49:47] lets me know you and I we might can be
[49:49] sold out for a while go through things
[49:52] for a while but God said that's my son
[49:55] that's my daughter they belong to me and
[49:57] Satan you can only keep them for so
[50:01] long praise the Lord oh you all right
[50:05] this
[50:06] morning in
[50:08] [Music]
[50:10] Jubilee I like this uh in Leviticus God
[50:15] makes sure in Jubilee which we're going
[50:18] to go to Leviticus in a moment God make
[50:21] sure that in the Jubilee that the
[50:24] inheritance won't be lost
[50:28] that's a powerful law that he made the
[50:30] year of jubile that's powerful to make
[50:33] sure we lose
[50:36] nothing it's the same that God
[50:38] predestinate us unto
[50:41] adoption how many you believe we've been
[50:43] predestinated to adoption that lets me
[50:46] know whatever God have planed in my life
[50:49] for me to come what position he has
[50:52] planned for me to come there's nothing
[50:55] going to stop that there ain't no trial
[50:58] going to stop that there ain't no
[50:59] situation going to stop that I'm going
[51:01] to get exactly where he want me to get
[51:03] to that's encouraging to me because many
[51:06] times we can look down on ourselves but
[51:08] that don't change God view that he has
[51:11] about
[51:12] you is that right everything that
[51:15] happens to the
[51:17] elect it makes no different what it is
[51:20] we come out on The Winning Side the
[51:23] Bible show us where some Believers seem
[51:25] to be trapped in situation seem to be
[51:27] like they deceived in situation they
[51:30] always come out of the Bible is full of
[51:32] so many example we always come out God
[51:35] makes sure of
[51:36] that praise the Lord now let's just go
[51:40] to Leviticus for a
[51:42] moment and we also know the scripture
[51:44] say all things work together for the
[51:47] good to them that love the Lord and you
[51:49] remember we always preach all things
[51:52] don't mean good
[51:55] things them things could be bad things
[51:58] but they all going to work too good
[52:01] aren't you thankful for that now but
[52:04] Brams here in the message returned in
[52:08] Jubilee He says
[52:10] this now if somehow or other the
[52:14] individual lost their inheritance I like
[52:17] the way he put it somehow or another
[52:20] other words something don't happen that
[52:22] they don't lost
[52:23] it he said that was given to them by God
[52:27] there came a year called The Jubilee
[52:30] every seven years they had a rest a
[52:34] Sabbath every seven days they had a
[52:36] Sabbath every seven years they had a
[52:39] Sabbath and every seven Sabbath was 49
[52:42] years the 50th year was Jubilee He just
[52:45] going from a week to seven years to 50
[52:49] years just that's what he's doing he
[52:52] said in this
[52:53] Jubilee every man that had lost his
[52:57] inheritance he says it again by some
[53:01] means this is the real beautiful part by
[53:04] some means he says this if he was a
[53:10] Freeborn true blooded
[53:13] Israelite see that's why I was telling
[53:15] Jubilee is not for everybody it say it
[53:18] says here he's a free born blooded
[53:22] Israelite that means that puts that
[53:25] means that Jubilee he's going to get it
[53:28] regardless can we say amen I I just love
[53:31] this he says right here he said it he
[53:33] said if he's a was a Freeborn true
[53:36] blooded Israelite no matter who held the
[53:40] possession it had to go back to him free
[53:44] he didn't have to pay anything he didn't
[53:47] have to do anything but stop what he was
[53:50] doing and go back to his
[53:53] inheritance other words he don't s sold
[53:56] out his land or whatever he sold out in
[53:59] them Years be going by you know what one
[54:02] day he out there sweating trying to pay
[54:04] off the debt or whatever but then that
[54:06] trumpet sound when he hear that trumpet
[54:09] blow he can just stop anything and you
[54:12] know one thing I like about it it makes
[54:14] no different one thing about a
[54:17] jubilee if he haven't paid the person
[54:20] that he sold out to the full amount of
[54:23] the money if he haven't paid it all it
[54:26] don't matter when the Jubilee come it
[54:29] says it's paid in
[54:32] full praise the Lord what you saying
[54:34] brother bur I say this that trumpet he
[54:37] Prophet said it's that go gospel trumpet
[54:40] when you hear that gospel trumpet it
[54:42] means that you can be free that tells me
[54:45] I can tell the devil I don't owe you
[54:47] nothing no more I I'm free I can walk
[54:50] out free no more complexes can we say
[54:53] Amen everything that I have done I now I
[54:56] can walk walk away from it and my
[55:00] freedom you got to hear that gospel
[55:02] trumpet cuz when that's when that Jew
[55:05] out there hoing and so forth when that
[55:07] trumpet go you know what other people
[55:10] are hearing it
[55:11] too other people are hearing it but he's
[55:13] the only one responding cuz he knows the
[55:16] meaning behind it he be like w yeah they
[55:19] like what is wrong with you you better
[55:21] you better pick up and start work oh no
[55:23] I'm free now he h the trumpet so this
[55:26] message is not for everybody but when
[55:30] the bride hear this message she knows
[55:32] this is my freedom this is my Liberty
[55:35] but then you get some said this is
[55:39] bondage no this is
[55:42] freedom this is Liberty tells me I can
[55:46] overcome sin I can live above sin can we
[55:49] say Amen it tells me I can doubt my
[55:52] doubts it tells me I'm free
[55:59] Jubilee He Oh my he had a right to
[56:04] it it was
[56:06] God giv
[56:08] right because he by Grace had inherited
[56:12] it and been given to his father handed
[56:16] down year after year no matter what had
[56:19] taken place if he lost it it must go
[56:23] free now he said
[56:27] it
[56:28] meant
[56:29] Grace is way provided for each
[56:33] individual to return to their rightful
[56:36] inheritance so juvilee was also their
[56:40] Grace remember the land shall not be
[56:43] sold
[56:44] Forever Friends I take that so
[56:46] personally that me the devil could not
[56:49] keep me forever because God makes sure
[56:52] that burle will were going to hear this
[56:54] gospel trumpet one day and and he was
[56:56] going to recognize it that he can be
[56:59] free he said what a picture to give us
[57:01] tonight of the church in the last days
[57:05] you see what man can do then you can see
[57:09] what God does What man does is failing
[57:13] and will fail has fail and always will
[57:17] fail but what God does is
[57:21] eternal it must forever remain nothing
[57:23] can take it away God give it is his free
[57:27] gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it
[57:30] placed it and there nothing could ever
[57:33] move it is there
[57:35] eternally and he said and at Jubilee was
[57:40] God's manner of expressing Grace to his
[57:44] people for restoring or be brought back
[57:48] to their rightful position so Jubilee is
[57:54] predestination God knew you and I was
[57:56] going to mess up but let me plant a seed
[57:59] in here let me put something in here
[58:01] that one day when that Light Strike it
[58:03] it'll wake up and they'll realize it's
[58:06] me pulling you calling
[58:09] you praise God are y'all going to preach
[58:13] with
[58:17] me let's go down a little further here I
[58:19] got something I want to do I'm just
[58:20] building up to
[58:24] it this might
[58:27] like how many of y'all know you a
[58:31] you are a kinsman
[58:35] redeemer not only just Jesus as a k
[58:39] Redeemer when you be born again you
[58:42] become
[58:43] one how I read it to you morning some of
[58:47] you that's okay that lets me know you're
[58:51] listening I'm so glad y'all not one of
[58:52] those churches soon as a minister say
[58:54] the prophet say ah a but never did read
[58:58] the
[59:01] quote see too much of
[59:03] that let him finish the
[59:06] quote said Prophet say ah
[59:09] amen okay then a lot of time you read
[59:13] the quote something that's against then
[59:14] it be like
[59:17] oh no we say Amen to what we believe
[59:22] what we can say Amen too there the word
[59:29] you know Leviticus
[59:33] 25:29 he said if a man sells a dwelling
[59:37] house in a wall
[59:40] City then he may redeem it in a whole
[59:43] year after it is sold within a full year
[59:47] may he redeem
[59:49] it and if he be not if and if he if it
[59:54] be not redeemed within the the space of
[59:56] a full year then the house that is in
[1:00:00] the wall City shall be established
[1:00:02] forever to him that bought it throughout
[1:00:05] his generation it shall no not go out in
[1:00:09] the Jubilee now watch this right here if
[1:00:11] it's in a wall City it's a limited time
[1:00:15] that it can come out but if it's not in
[1:00:18] a wall City whenever they hear that
[1:00:19] trumpet that Jubilee trumpet it could
[1:00:21] come out so there's a time space here
[1:00:25] and I like the way the prophet going to
[1:00:27] put it I'll read it to you in a moment
[1:00:29] he said verse 31 but the houses of The
[1:00:32] Villages which have no wall round about
[1:00:35] them shall be counted as the fields of
[1:00:37] the country they may be redeemed and
[1:00:40] they shall go out in the Jubilee then
[1:00:44] brother bam he be to uh explain these
[1:00:48] things I really didn't understand what
[1:00:49] these mean to I heard him say what it
[1:00:51] mean amen now let's just read the quote
[1:00:54] we'll just kind of BL it in together now
[1:00:58] he going to also talk
[1:01:00] about in the scriptures it's just so
[1:01:02] amazing sometimes a
[1:01:05] stranger could come amongst Israel and
[1:01:09] work for
[1:01:10] them then the stranger can get
[1:01:13] rich just for
[1:01:15] working and when he get rich The
[1:01:18] Stranger can buy a brother that's right
[1:01:22] right which is sad now you got the
[1:01:25] stranger Divine the brother that's sad
[1:01:28] are you with me but he brought that out
[1:01:31] he said if the rich
[1:01:33] servant this is the returning Jubilee a
[1:01:36] man come in become a servant and got
[1:01:40] rich notice a servant and got rich and
[1:01:44] he bought a
[1:01:46] brother that brother could be Redeemed
[1:01:50] by a
[1:01:51] Kinsman a Kinsman could come get him in
[1:01:55] the year jubile
[1:01:56] and could redeem him he said what a
[1:01:59] beautiful Christ here we have a
[1:02:02] beautiful picture rather of Christ that
[1:02:04] a pilgrim out there in a bond sold out
[1:02:08] to the rich cities out there sold out
[1:02:11] into the richest organizations what he's
[1:02:14] doing now he's taking that to this age
[1:02:17] of Rich cuz this is the lay of the sin
[1:02:18] age when you see a brother or sister
[1:02:22] still stuck in those systems listen what
[1:02:25] he says now he said but a Kinsman
[1:02:29] brother who know he's out there some
[1:02:33] night I love it put his Bible under his
[1:02:36] arm and go after him of kinsman because
[1:02:40] he got the same Spirit he's born in the
[1:02:43] same family God called him out of that
[1:02:45] group so guess what when you yourself
[1:02:48] become a Believer you become born again
[1:02:50] you can have another predestinated seed
[1:02:53] trapped out there in them systems God
[1:02:55] can send you you out there to bring them
[1:02:57] back and show them you don't belong
[1:03:00] there God got something for you come out
[1:03:02] of her my people right that's also rest
[1:03:06] in us that's
[1:03:09] right what you think they doing your
[1:03:12] pastor different on you going doing
[1:03:14] Bible studies what are you doing you
[1:03:18] playing the role of a kinsman redeemer
[1:03:21] yourself because those are your brothers
[1:03:23] and sisters and you're trying to pull
[1:03:24] them out praise God
[1:03:27] now you might say wow what about they if
[1:03:29] they ain't really born again how can
[1:03:30] they be your brother I'm speaking for as
[1:03:32] the way God see things that could be of
[1:03:35] predestinated seed we just
[1:03:38] working prise God and the word had to
[1:03:40] come through the body to get to another
[1:03:43] body that's
[1:03:45] right he's the king from Redeemer had
[1:03:48] that picture he said how that picture
[1:03:51] was portrayed wonderfully in the Book of
[1:03:54] Ruth Boaz when he was taking the place
[1:03:58] of a k Redeemer representing
[1:04:02] Christ are you with me yes sir let's
[1:04:05] just keep going just a little bit
[1:04:08] longer cuz I don't want to hold you
[1:04:15] long so
[1:04:18] Jubilee in the Old Testament they could
[1:04:21] return back to their possessions and
[1:04:24] land and so forth
[1:04:26] but when it come to the New Testament
[1:04:28] God wasn't too much focused on land and
[1:04:30] stuff like that he was focused on this
[1:04:33] land that's right because when Jesus
[1:04:35] came to begin to preach the acceptable
[1:04:37] year of the Gospel that was a jubilee
[1:04:39] that's right but he wasn't looking for
[1:04:40] natural land that's he was looking for
[1:04:42] these that's what he was calling for a
[1:04:44] jubilee come to set them at libert them
[1:04:47] that are abundant set them at Liberty
[1:04:49] the captiv free that was a jubilee but
[1:04:51] look at all them rejected that Jubilee
[1:04:54] but there was some pred inated to
[1:04:56] receive that Jubilee right yes sir are
[1:04:59] you with me yes sir so that's what this
[1:05:01] message have come to you and me brothers
[1:05:03] and sisters it is our
[1:05:06] Jubilee now I want to do
[1:05:13] something you know there's
[1:05:17] traps this might be more towards younger
[1:05:22] people but it's important
[1:05:26] there's traps and
[1:05:28] snares
[1:05:31] everywhere and the devil start working
[1:05:34] on you while you're
[1:05:36] young is that right I couldn't run
[1:05:39] across some people to today was just
[1:05:42] bullied when they was young and it'll
[1:05:45] still affect them to
[1:05:47] today they just can't seem to get over
[1:05:51] it God can help you get over
[1:05:54] that praise the Lord remember I gave
[1:05:56] y'all my testimony I was one of the
[1:05:58] bullies that bullied
[1:06:00] bullies and I quite enjoyed
[1:06:03] it because I just could not see somebody
[1:06:06] overtaking somebody helplessly and they
[1:06:09] just enjoyed I just couldn't take it no
[1:06:13] we have to do something about
[1:06:15] that and people get scarred on things
[1:06:17] like
[1:06:18] that but you as a young
[1:06:21] person when you come into church you
[1:06:25] should listen listen when your pastor is
[1:06:28] preaching I like brother bam said when
[1:06:31] the word Goes
[1:06:33] Forth he said the Holy Spirit follows
[1:06:36] it it follows it that's right and what
[1:06:39] you have to do be a re receive what God
[1:06:42] is saying through that word and apply it
[1:06:44] to yourself a lot of times you hear
[1:06:47] things your pastor say different
[1:06:49] ministers saying you ain't even even
[1:06:51] going through it that don't mean you
[1:06:54] just say it ain't got didn't do with me
[1:06:56] no you need to grab that and store it in
[1:06:59] your heart
[1:07:01] drive that as you begin to grow in life
[1:07:04] and things start happening in your life
[1:07:06] them words could come back to you to
[1:07:08] show you how to avoid that or either
[1:07:10] overcome that or how to deal with that
[1:07:13] don't just throw it out you're here for
[1:07:16] a reason if there's going to be another
[1:07:18] generation you're that
[1:07:21] generation and it's such an honor you
[1:07:23] should have you should see young people
[1:07:26] to be able to just sit around the word
[1:07:28] I'm I'm talking to you from my heart cuz
[1:07:31] the people that I do Bible study with
[1:07:33] them some messed up children that's
[1:07:37] right the things that they go through
[1:07:39] I'm like wow and you have to deal with
[1:07:42] them but yet you're sitting under the
[1:07:44] reveal word of the hour God helping you
[1:07:47] ton not to get that type of stuff so
[1:07:49] don't be adventurous in your mind
[1:07:51] curious what's going on out there what
[1:07:52] are they doing no I'm telling you
[1:07:54] curiosity kill the
[1:07:57] cat and that Curiosity will do the same
[1:08:00] thing to you you don't have to try to
[1:08:01] wonder what's going on out there no stay
[1:08:04] right here stay right in the word don't
[1:08:06] worry about nothing else just stay in
[1:08:08] the
[1:08:10] message cuz it's
[1:08:11] important we can't make you do it
[1:08:16] though
[1:08:17] we we can just
[1:08:20] encourage praise the Lord cuz
[1:08:24] traps the the devil brings trap so
[1:08:28] slick until they look you remember sin
[1:08:31] look beautiful it's a pilling but yet
[1:08:35] death is sitting right behind it that's
[1:08:38] how the devil
[1:08:40] works are you with me yes sir let me
[1:08:44] read some more things to you I'm still
[1:08:46] on Jubilee believe it or not we going to
[1:08:48] just work our way around cuz I believe
[1:08:50] in Freedom amen that's one of the
[1:08:53] saddest thing you can see a message
[1:08:55] believer in bondage like the prophet
[1:08:58] talk about the eagle in in a cage when
[1:09:01] we supposed to be living in freedom and
[1:09:03] liberty that's right praise the Lord
[1:09:06] even while we going through our trials
[1:09:08] that's right still might look weary on
[1:09:10] the outside but inside it's bubbling
[1:09:14] encouraging inside I got to keep
[1:09:15] pressing
[1:09:19] on Jesus says this in Matthew
[1:09:22] 6 no man can serve two masters
[1:09:26] for he either will hate the
[1:09:29] one and love the other or else he will
[1:09:32] hold to the one and despise the other
[1:09:35] you cannot serve God in Mamon that don't
[1:09:38] need no
[1:09:40] interpretation it just exactly what he
[1:09:42] said you can't serve two
[1:09:44] masters then he comes in Luke
[1:09:46] 14 he says Luke 1425 it said there came
[1:09:51] a great there went a great multitude
[1:09:53] with him he turned and said to to
[1:09:57] them think great multitude just coming
[1:10:00] around Jesus looks at him he turns and
[1:10:02] say to them if a man come to me hate not
[1:10:07] his father and mother and wife and
[1:10:11] children and Brethren and sisters yeah
[1:10:16] in his own life he cannot be my disciple
[1:10:18] some of them probably say what kind of
[1:10:20] sermon is this that's right here we is
[1:10:22] coming with big happy Hearts want to
[1:10:24] hear the good gospel the good news and
[1:10:25] you going to turn around tell me hate my
[1:10:27] mom
[1:10:30] really see Jesus could pick up they want
[1:10:32] they want to follow him now follow him
[1:10:34] now oh you want to follow me he said let
[1:10:36] me see how bad you really want to follow
[1:10:39] me he wasn't talking about I hate you
[1:10:42] mama no that a what he talking about
[1:10:45] what he's talking about you can't put
[1:10:47] none of that before
[1:10:49] me none of
[1:10:51] it I was talking to a young boy
[1:10:55] having marriage
[1:10:57] problems cuz he done this one is not a
[1:11:00] Believer I said let me tell you
[1:11:02] something

[1:11:08] your wife that's right huh that's right
[1:11:12] your daddy your brother your sister your
[1:11:16] best friend your favorite cousin none of
[1:11:19] them become before your wife that's
[1:11:21] right I said because you don't have a
[1:11:23] vow with neither one of them yes
[1:11:26] I said your vow is to your
[1:11:31] wife I said same for her her daddy her
[1:11:35] mama don't come before you she didn't
[1:11:38] make a vow with them she made a vow to

[1:12:43] we put God before all of it yes
[1:12:49] sir when Jesus was talking about except
[1:12:53] you hate mother father brother sisters I
[1:12:57] think I really believe his thoughts was
[1:13:00] coming from Exodus when he was quoting
[1:13:03] the
[1:13:05] scripture and I'll read it to you in a
[1:13:08] moment I believe this where his thoughts
[1:13:10] was coming from because he's showing
[1:13:13] something in the New
[1:13:15] Testament these things can be
[1:13:20] traps if you put them before me there'll
[1:13:22] be traps that's right yeah and let me
[1:13:25] show you where I believe he was getting
[1:13:26] that from turn to Exodus
[1:13:33] 21 I don't know what time I started but
[1:13:37] y'all can give me a few more minutes
[1:13:38] can't
[1:13:42] you Exodus
[1:13:45] 21 to be honest I have an honest
[1:13:48] confession brother
[1:13:49] Chad this something I had been wanting
[1:13:51] to do years ago cuz I know y'all got
[1:13:53] good recording stuff
[1:13:56] I've done this what I'm going to do
[1:13:57] several times but I like for be
[1:14:01] nice so people could just see it not for
[1:14:05] entertainment but could learn something
[1:14:07] from it how crafty that devil actually
[1:14:10] is Exodus
[1:14:12] 21:1 now these are the Judgment which
[1:14:15] Thou shalt set before them as thou by
[1:14:20] and Hebrew
[1:14:21] servant six years He Shall Serve and and
[1:14:25] in the seventh he shall go out free for
[1:14:30] nothing if he come in by himself he
[1:14:32] shall go out by himself if he were
[1:14:34] married then his wife shall go out with
[1:14:36] him if his
[1:14:38] master have given him a wife and she
[1:14:41] have borne him Sons and Daughters the
[1:14:44] wife and the children shall be her
[1:14:46] Masters and she shall and he shall go
[1:14:49] out by himself and if the servant shall
[1:14:52] plainly say I love my master my wife and
[1:14:55] my children I will not go out free then
[1:14:58] his master shall bring him to the judges
[1:15:01] he shall also bring him to the door of
[1:15:04] the doorpost and his master shall bore
[1:15:06] his ear with an awe and he shall serve

[1:28:02] them
[1:28:04] okay now I'm going to ask y'all a
[1:28:06] question young
[1:28:08] people did he make the right
[1:28:13] decision come on young people did he
[1:28:15] make the right
[1:28:18] decision he said he going to stay did he
[1:28:22] make the right decision
[1:28:26] see it's
[1:28:28] quiet he made the wrong
[1:28:33] decision now he just sold out his
[1:28:37] freedom and he didn't realize it's been
[1:28:40] a trap all along he got so caught up
[1:28:44] into her and what I was telling her to
[1:28:46] do he couldn't see what I was doing but
[1:28:49] now he don't come to a
[1:28:51] place I have to make a decision
[1:28:56] you see that's what the devil do all
[1:28:57] through your
[1:28:59] life and then it come to that place when
[1:29:02] God deals with your
[1:29:04] heart now you got to make a
[1:29:07] decision man I have to confess certain
[1:29:10] things right I have to repent some
[1:29:13] things that oh oh man but I was having
[1:29:17] so much fun when I was doing it but I
[1:29:18] got to make that right to serve the Lord
[1:29:21] what I'm going to do right now that's a
[1:29:24] trap yeah
[1:29:26] yeah but if you want your
[1:29:29] freedom you would be
[1:29:31] willing Lord whatever that's right I
[1:29:36] need to let go I'll let it go cuz you
[1:29:40] remember the scripture say he said I
[1:29:42] love my master and you can't serve two
[1:29:46] right this what Jesus was getting that
[1:29:47] thought from right you see how it was
[1:29:51] you see how it kind of little reality to
[1:29:52] he said that's tough
[1:29:56] and that's the way it is when you don't
[1:29:57] got yourself caught up into all kind of
[1:29:59] stuff now God the Holy Spirit on start
[1:30:02] dealing with you that's right now you're
[1:30:03] in a valley of decision that's right
[1:30:06] what I'm going to do now that's why I'm
[1:30:08] here to tell you as young watch
[1:30:11] everything through prayer and the word
[1:30:14] cuz the devil got
[1:30:16] trapped he just got them laying
[1:30:19] there see in the book of Nehemiah
[1:30:24] or Israel when they come out of
[1:30:27] Babylon the Bible say they married
[1:30:29] strange wives That's
[1:30:31] Right Nehemiah told him if you want to
[1:30:34] go on with the Lord and prosper get rid
[1:30:38] of them wives and them children that's
[1:30:41] right you know how painful that was but
[1:30:44] they did it that's right they did it so
[1:30:47] they can be free see God want us to be
[1:30:51] free that's right when you hear rebuking
[1:30:53] in the word it's not to B put you in
[1:30:56] bondage it's to expose
[1:30:58] error so you can get away from that
[1:31:01] stuff not trying to kill you or hurt you
[1:31:03] trying to get you to a place now while
[1:31:05] you're young that when you get older you
[1:31:07] don't have to come to these decisions
[1:31:09] right look how he don't have a bun
[1:31:12] now he just can't look at them and say
[1:31:14] I'm out of here
[1:31:16] no that's why the devil want to make you
[1:31:18] get into some covenants with him on some
[1:31:22] things and his traps on all behind it
[1:31:25] can be job
[1:31:27] traps friend traps boy traps girl traps
[1:31:31] it's all kind of them right and if you
[1:31:33] ain't
[1:31:34] careful it going to cost you a hard time
[1:31:37] right that's why the prophet said this
[1:31:40] is the age a Christian need to be on his
[1:31:42] toes more than any age is this age these
[1:31:47] things are
[1:31:48] important there are Minister
[1:31:50] traps Church traps it's all all kinds of
[1:31:56] them now come on over
[1:32:00] here get me a
[1:32:03] hammer
[1:32:06] oh now he belongs to
[1:32:11] me and the prophet
[1:32:14] said when you start rejecting the word
[1:32:16] what does it start you st wanting to
[1:32:20] hear you don't want to hear it no more
[1:32:22] I'm tired of hearing this I'm tired of
[1:32:24] the that's the
[1:32:26] devil he can't serve two Master let's
[1:32:28] get him a
[1:32:35] hand you see I don't know if y'all heard
[1:32:38] him at first he said I'm going to go
[1:32:42] free he said I'm going then he he kind
[1:32:45] of
[1:32:47] look
[1:32:52] this tell he brother and
[1:32:55] sisters this message is a jubilee that's
[1:32:58] right but you T all those things again
[1:33:01] it shows traps that's right look at the
[1:33:04] one that got trapped by the house in a
[1:33:06] wall City
[1:33:08] that's and the scripture said for
[1:33:12] generations for Generations it still
[1:33:15] would be no Redemption for it no
[1:33:17] bringing it
[1:33:19] back and the prophet brought that thing
[1:33:22] around that's why when you hear people
[1:33:24] say I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a
[1:33:27] Pentecostal they identifying I'm stuck
[1:33:29] in a wall that's
[1:33:32] right for generations for Generation
[1:33:35] that's why a Baptist bring a back forth
[1:33:37] a Baptist a Methodist bring for a
[1:33:39] Methodist cuz that's where the
[1:33:40] inheritance at is behind a wall the
[1:33:42] walls of Babylon the walls of
[1:33:44] denomination but God told us come out
[1:33:48] come out of her my people
[1:33:54] that's my message to you this
[1:33:56] morning this message is
[1:33:59] Jubilee can we get the Lord a
[1:34:01] [Applause]

[1:41:47] don't
[1:41:49] know which direction to go
[1:41:54] but we know we have things burning in
[1:41:56] our hearts it's because it's something
[1:41:58] you have given
[1:42:01] us and I had many thoughts on my heart
[1:42:04] this morning Lord but we just felt the
[1:42:06] leading to go this
[1:42:08] way my heart just go out so much in this
[1:42:11] time for family young people but the
[1:42:15] devil just attacking in so many
[1:42:16] different ways
[1:42:18] now taking away family time
[1:42:23] taking away the altar out of the
[1:42:26] home the altar out of the home been
[1:42:30] placed with
[1:42:31] Instagram Facebook Tik
[1:42:35] Tok then we wonder what is going on all
[1:42:40] of these things could be used for the
[1:42:41] good Lord
[1:42:43] but they're so time consuming and take
[1:42:46] so much time get caught up into ads
[1:42:49] things popping up and all these things
[1:42:52] you don't even want to see suggestions
[1:42:54] you don't even want the
[1:42:56] suggestion because the way these things
[1:42:58] are designed whenever you
[1:43:01] search it makes a pattern for you to
[1:43:03] throw things out what it think you're
[1:43:05] looking
[1:43:07] for the intelligence of an
[1:43:10] AI the intelligent of all these
[1:43:13] things the devil is all behind it Lord
[1:43:17] but father may we watch what we say
[1:43:19] watch what we do watch what we hear and
[1:43:22] be mindful of the word let that word
[1:43:24] stand between us let's walk with the
[1:43:27] word in our hearts with conviction of
[1:43:30] the Holy Spirit when he say no we say
[1:43:32] thank you Lord when he say yes we say
[1:43:34] thank you
[1:43:35] Lord so we just give everything in our
[1:43:38] hands in the name of Jesus Christ father
[1:43:42] we
[1:43:43] pray amen you know
[1:43:47] huh Spirits never die that's right
[1:43:51] right you know Trump
[1:43:55] some of you might be voting for them it
[1:43:56] don't make no difference to me I don't
[1:43:58] vote for none of
[1:43:59] them but if you a trump person I'm just
[1:44:03] going to be honest with you you just
[1:44:06] dealing with a modernday
[1:44:10] Constantine that's who you're dealing
[1:44:12] with the spirit of Constantine is on
[1:44:14] Trump look at the Trump
[1:44:17] Bible Trump
[1:44:19] Bible what you think that guy is doing
[1:44:22] you using the same maneuver to get
[1:44:25] Church religion on his side and it
[1:44:27] sounds so beautiful but it's all just
[1:44:30] ushering in the mark of the beast is
[1:44:34] also ushering in the pressure that he
[1:44:36] going to bring from the denominations to
[1:44:38] the bride he's a perfect candidate for
[1:44:42] that that what Constantine did Same
[1:44:47] Spirit Trump Bible and then he says put
[1:44:51] prayer back in America again
[1:44:54] put God back in America again he said
[1:44:56] out of his own mouth we need to put the
[1:44:58] power back in the church that sound good
[1:45:00] don't it just a
[1:45:02] trap but we know
[1:45:05] better how do we know better because of
[1:45:08] this
[1:45:11] message I believe more
[1:45:14] now when brother Brandon was
[1:45:17] preaching yes it was for them back when
[1:45:19] he was preaching with them but it's more
[1:45:21] so now for us yes sir cuz we back then
