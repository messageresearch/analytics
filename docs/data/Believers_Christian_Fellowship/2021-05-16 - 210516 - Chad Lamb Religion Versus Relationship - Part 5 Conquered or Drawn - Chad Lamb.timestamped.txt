[0:00] there's a country far beyond the starry
[0:03] sky
[0:05] oh there's a city where there never
[0:07] comes a night
[0:09] and if we're faithful we shall go there
[0:12] by and by
[0:14] oh just
[0:38] here we have our days of sunshine but we
[0:41] know
[0:43] that the sun which shines upon us now so
[0:46] bright
[0:47] we'll be changing clouds and rain until
[0:50] we go
[0:52] to that city where the lamp is
[1:06] [Music]
[1:17] [Applause]
[1:21] it shall be one eternal dick without a
[1:24] knife and our tears shall forever be
[1:28] wiped away
[1:30] oh in that city where the lamp is alive
[1:35] oh in that city where the lamp is
[1:52] is live here we have our disappointments
[1:56] all the while
[1:59] and our bond is hopes but meet with
[2:01] bitter blood
[2:03] though by night we weep the morning
[2:06] brings a smile
[2:08] in that city where the lamp is
[2:34] twilight bring its gloom not a shadow
[2:38] can
[2:38] my blissful soul of rock before i
[2:42] load it up in heaven
[2:46] in that city where the lamp
[3:00] [Music]
[3:38] amen aren't you glad you have a mansion
[3:40] over there this morning
[3:46] of the lord is in this
[3:50] place i can feel
[3:54] his mighty power
[3:57] and his grace
[4:02] i can hear the brush of
[4:06] angel's wings i see glory surely
[4:16] the presence of the lord
[4:20] is in this place
[4:31] [Music]
[4:40] is
[4:55] [Music]
[5:00] [Music]
[5:06] praise god amen god bless you all it's
[5:10] good to be with you this morning let's
[5:12] while we're standing just take our
[5:13] bibles and turn to hebrews chapter 11.
[5:18] amen i was encouraged to hear about the
[5:21] youth getting together to help sister
[5:23] land that was
[5:24] such a wonderful thing brother kyle sent
[5:25] me pictures and a list of all they did
[5:28] and
[5:28] they're an amazing work crew and uh we
[5:31] should really be thankful for them and
[5:33] we thank you for the effort you put
[5:35] forth and
[5:36] i know sister luanne was blessed man
[5:39] it's good to use your strength
[5:41] for someone else amen god has all given
[5:43] us something something we can do for the
[5:45] body something we do for one another
[5:47] and it's nice when we find those two
[5:49] meat a need and an ability when they
[5:51] come together
[5:52] brings a blessing so we thank god for
[5:54] that
[5:56] let's start here hebrews chapter 11. i'm
[5:58] going to
[5:59] continue on with religion versus
[6:00] relationship i believe this is part five
[6:03] and my subtitle for this is conquered or
[6:06] drawn conquered or drawn
[6:10] hebrews chapter 11 verse 1
[6:14] now faith is the substance of things
[6:15] hoped for the
[6:17] evidence of things not seen for by it
[6:20] the elders obtained
[6:21] a good report so you know we've read
[6:24] through this so many times but you can
[6:26] never just get away from the realities
[6:28] the truth that's laying here
[6:29] and it becomes deeper and deeper all the
[6:31] time because faith is the substance of
[6:34] things hoped for
[6:35] so faith is a substance it's not it's
[6:37] not a trivial thing it's not a light
[6:40] passing thought
[6:41] but faith is a substance amen
[6:44] so we can't think of faith as just an
[6:46] idea or a mental
[6:48] concept or or a thought that passes
[6:50] through the mind faith is much
[6:51] different than that amen faith is an
[6:54] anchoring and faith is a substance of
[6:56] things hoped for
[6:57] the evidence
[7:01] amen so many people want evidence that
[7:03] they're a christian evidence of this and
[7:04] we're looking for evidences
[7:06] faith is the evidence amen the evidence
[7:10] of things
[7:10] not seen for by it the elders obtained
[7:14] a good report through faith we
[7:16] understand that the world's refrained by
[7:18] the word of god
[7:19] so that things which are seen were not
[7:21] made of things which do appear
[7:23] so when brother branham says when god
[7:26] created the world he had to speak his
[7:27] word and believe his own word it comes
[7:29] right from this scripture here
[7:31] because we know that through faith we
[7:32] understand the worlds were framed
[7:35] whose faith god's faith amen god had to
[7:38] believe his own word he had to speak
[7:40] and believe his own word believing his
[7:41] word would come to pass amen
[7:44] for by faith we understand that the
[7:45] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[7:47] that things which are seen were not made
[7:49] of things which do appear by faith abel
[7:53] offered unto god a more excellent
[7:54] sacrifice than cain
[7:56] by which he obtained witness that he was
[7:58] righteous
[7:59] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[8:02] being dead yet speaketh
[8:04] by faith enoch was translated that he
[8:06] should not see death and was not
[8:08] found because god had translated him for
[8:11] before his
[8:12] translation he had this testimony that
[8:14] he pleased
[8:15] god i want to walk like enoch
[8:20] so that i can walk right on out of here
[8:22] who wants to walk like enon
[8:24] so enoch had a testimony and the
[8:26] testimony before that he left was that
[8:28] he pleased
[8:29] god so i want to do what enoch did amen
[8:32] and so verse 6 holds the key but without
[8:35] faith it is impossible to please him
[8:38] amen
[8:40] what did enoch do that pleased him he
[8:42] not believed
[8:43] what god told him
[8:46] but without faith it is impossible to
[8:48] please him for he that cometh to god
[8:50] must believe that he is
[8:51] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[8:53] diligently
[8:54] seek him amen let's bow our heads and
[8:59] pray
[9:00] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[9:02] father we just ask
[9:03] all that you would do what you've done
[9:05] so many times that you honor your word
[9:08] lord as we've come to honor it lord and
[9:10] gather ourselves together as your word
[9:12] says and we're trusting lord in your
[9:14] method
[9:15] while we ask that you come on the scene
[9:17] and do what you've done for us so many
[9:18] times because you are faithful to keep
[9:20] your word
[9:21] that you would come and break the bread
[9:23] of life and speak your eternal word to
[9:25] us for we have need of it in this hour
[9:27] we need your word to be our light lord
[9:30] to guide us in this day that we live in
[9:32] and we need it to be our sustaining
[9:34] portion that gives us strength to
[9:35] continue in the journey
[9:37] that you have for us we ask that you
[9:39] would take preeminence among us and you
[9:41] will be pleased with all that's said and
[9:42] done
[9:43] may we receive you lord as you reveal
[9:46] yourself to us
[9:47] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[9:50] you can be seated
[9:56] i'm going to read just two quotes that
[9:59] we've been reading
[10:01] all along just to bring it keep it fresh
[10:03] in our minds
[10:06] he says in the god of this evil age
[10:10] he says and notice cain he didn't want
[10:12] no blood sacrifice
[10:13] he came down and offered the fruit or
[10:15] the fields of beauty upon his altar
[10:17] very religious i want you to catch that
[10:20] and
[10:21] i hope you're i hope this is a common
[10:23] theme now over these last few weeks
[10:25] that we're we're holding on to that very
[10:27] religious
[10:28] so the false vine is very religious
[10:31] the false vine isn't necessarily the
[10:33] ones who are are
[10:35] out in the in the bars and in the
[10:37] nightclubs and things like that the
[10:39] false vine is very religious and those
[10:42] two
[10:42] vines amen in the book of genesis they
[10:45] begin to
[10:46] intertwine amen and they begin to wrap
[10:48] around one another
[10:49] until it's very hard to discern between
[10:52] the true and the false vine
[10:54] because they're all wrapped around one
[10:56] another amen
[10:58] and and they look like they're in one
[11:00] group but
[11:01] at the end of the church ages brother
[11:02] branham was the one who was able to come
[11:04] back
[11:05] and he was able to point out that all
[11:06] through the church ages there was two
[11:08] groups
[11:09] because every message to every age was a
[11:11] message to two different groups
[11:13] there was the message that those who
[11:14] kept the word amen those who were
[11:16] faithful and there was a message to
[11:17] those
[11:17] who weren't and brother madam at the end
[11:19] of the ages he began to unravel the
[11:21] church ages
[11:22] and when he's unraveling the church ages
[11:24] he was showing the two vines within the
[11:26] framework of the true
[11:28] church and so
[11:31] now we know that he was very religious
[11:33] done everything that
[11:34] just exactly like abel done offered a
[11:37] sacrifice fell down before god in
[11:38] worship
[11:39] obedient every day but without the
[11:41] revelation of the word
[11:43] and the word was from the beginning
[11:46] god's plan
[11:47] oh if we could just catch that ingrain
[11:50] that date deep down into your soul
[11:52] the word was from the beginning god's
[11:55] plan
[11:57] this was god's plan when man fell he
[12:00] fell
[12:00] from the word amen when god is going to
[12:03] restore he's going to restore man back
[12:05] to the word
[12:06] amen because the word was from the
[12:08] beginning
[12:09] god's plan and that's why in our day the
[12:12] full revelation of the full word had to
[12:14] be restored
[12:15] because from the beginning that was
[12:17] god's plan
[12:20] so and the word was from the beginning
[12:21] god's plan but god revealed by
[12:23] revelation
[12:24] the very thing that he vindicated and
[12:26] punctuated that that was
[12:27] right not religion not an altar
[12:31] not belonging to church not making a
[12:33] sacrifice
[12:35] not being sincere but by the revelation
[12:38] of the word of god
[12:40] so what is the path back the path back
[12:42] is by the revelation of the word of god
[12:45] it's the only path back and the message
[12:48] god hiding himself in simplicity he says
[12:51] in the beginning when man sinned it
[12:53] showed the nature of man he all he's
[12:55] always trying to hide from god
[12:58] oh just catch this friends this is
[13:01] religion he's talking about religion
[13:03] he's talking about churches and
[13:04] doctrines and denominations
[13:06] and man's reasoning he says god man from
[13:09] the beginning when man sinned he showed
[13:11] the nature of man
[13:12] he's always trying to hide from god
[13:15] and make himself a way that he can feel
[13:17] justified
[13:18] a religion so this is what man is
[13:22] always trying to do and if we understand
[13:24] that's what man is always trying to do
[13:25] that's what he's always tried to do
[13:27] that's what he's currently trying to do
[13:29] and that's what the devil is trying to
[13:30] tempt you to do
[13:34] what me who do you think he's gunning
[13:37] for who do you think
[13:38] he was always trying to work where god
[13:40] was working he was always trying to trip
[13:42] up the elect
[13:42] and bind them and keep the plan of god
[13:44] from progressing
[13:46] amen satan is trying to stop the forward
[13:49] momentum of redemption he's trying to
[13:51] stop god's plan
[13:52] from coming into fruition so where would
[13:55] he work amen where
[13:56] where would he bring deception where
[13:58] would he bring a disruption amen
[14:00] what would he do in this day if he wants
[14:02] to stop the forward momentum of god's
[14:04] redemptive plan
[14:05] and the word moving forward amen to
[14:07] bring a full restitution of all things
[14:10] what would he attack would he go and
[14:11] bring a deception amen
[14:13] amen where where would he go he would
[14:15] come right to where god's working right
[14:17] to where the word is
[14:18] and try to do what he's always done he's
[14:21] tried to bring a diversion
[14:23] a deception a reasoning bring something
[14:26] else
[14:27] to stop the plan of god amen when the
[14:29] word's been unfolded
[14:32] and and brother brahms shows us this
[14:34] very clearly he says
[14:35] you know in luther's day luther got amen
[14:38] a word and that word was to begin
[14:41] to bring the people's attention and
[14:43] attraction back to god
[14:45] so luther's word that he brought was a
[14:47] way back into fellowship with god
[14:50] amen and he brought justification by
[14:52] faith but then
[14:53] fallen angels amen fallen angels got in
[14:57] and they turned they took that truth
[14:59] amen
[15:00] and and then instead of going on with
[15:02] the truth and coming into where they are
[15:04] now
[15:04] they got them to denominate or build a
[15:07] system
[15:07] or a city a walled city around that
[15:10] truth
[15:11] and when they did he stopped the forward
[15:13] progress
[15:16] of the elect that's always been the
[15:19] the attempt but god will always raise
[15:21] somebody up to bring a word to bring
[15:23] them out
[15:24] and bring them up god's word is always
[15:26] progressing but the devil is always
[15:28] trying to stop the progress of god's
[15:29] word
[15:31] so so we can look at temptation i mean
[15:34] all over the place
[15:35] but if we don't recognize that those
[15:37] same spirits are present today
[15:39] and those those same spirits are trying
[15:41] to disrupt god's plan
[15:42] and we know god's plan and we know where
[15:44] god's working why would we look
[15:46] anywhere else but all around us for
[15:48] deception
[15:51] even in our own minds and our own
[15:53] thinking amen the temptations and the
[15:55] thoughts that would come
[15:56] i mean we have to judge every thought
[15:58] and bring every thought
[15:59] a captive into obedience unto christ
[16:03] that's what paul tells us to do because
[16:06] the temptation is all around us
[16:08] trying to stop the forward progress of
[16:09] god's word if he can take
[16:12] oh friends listen in this day if he can
[16:14] stop
[16:15] and guilt us to build denominational
[16:17] walls amen
[16:18] he doesn't mind how much past truth you
[16:21] accept once god opened the door to
[16:24] justification by faith
[16:26] amen the devil never tried to take away
[16:28] justification by faith
[16:30] because even the catholic church now is
[16:32] willing to adopt
[16:35] justification by faith as long
[16:38] as justification by faith still makes
[16:40] you require the priesthood in the
[16:41] sacraments
[16:45] they're willing to adjust amen
[16:48] so now that the now the revelations out
[16:51] he
[16:51] he can never put the revelation back in
[16:54] so what he wants to do is now get you to
[16:56] stop at this revelation
[16:57] and not move to the next revelation
[17:02] and when god called abraham out abraham
[17:05] was called
[17:06] separated and removed out of the trouble
[17:08] of babylon removed out of
[17:10] from the scattering from babylon and god
[17:13] broke that system up because he had to
[17:14] get that elect
[17:15] out of that system so he can begin to
[17:17] deal with him as an individual
[17:20] that's the same thing that's happened in
[17:21] our day god through the prophet has
[17:23] broke that
[17:24] he's took the sword of the word and writ
[17:26] writ the denominational veil into
[17:30] so that he can call us out of that
[17:33] system so that he can deal with us as an
[17:34] individual
[17:37] so abraham in his journey you recognize
[17:41] that abraham dwelt in tents tabernacles
[17:45] with isaac and with jacob amen abraham
[17:48] never built a city cain goes out and
[17:52] builds a city
[17:53] nimrod builds a city and the tower amen
[17:55] everybody goes to do something to
[17:57] perform something to build something to
[17:59] keep propagating
[18:00] amen their own idea and their own
[18:02] religion but abraham never builds a city
[18:05] why doesn't abraham build a city because
[18:07] abraham was
[18:08] looking for a city that has foundations
[18:10] whose builder and maker was god
[18:12] and if you're looking for the city
[18:14] there's no reason to build a city
[18:18] they're saying if you're if you here
[18:20] here today looking for a city whose
[18:22] builder and maker is gone
[18:24] amen there is no reason to start a
[18:26] denomination to build a city
[18:28] to stack stones together amen if you
[18:30] build a city
[18:31] it goes to prove amen that you're not
[18:34] looking for that city
[18:39] so the devil's always trying to get them
[18:41] to build a city of lutheran and build a
[18:43] city of wesley
[18:44] build a city of pentecostals amen and
[18:46] not get them to continue
[18:48] being a pilgrim
[18:52] and a stranger
[18:55] looking abraham was told
[18:58] by god he said now after he finally
[19:00] separated from lot
[19:01] as we were speaking last time and he and
[19:03] he stood up he brought him and he said
[19:05] now
[19:05] behold north south east the west i've
[19:08] given all you said walk the land
[19:12] abraham there is no reason for abraham
[19:16] to settle down
[19:19] because abraham was still discovering
[19:21] the promised land
[19:24] and because abraham was still he was a
[19:27] pilgrim
[19:28] amen because he was still traveling
[19:31] the promises and searching out the
[19:33] promises and
[19:35] and in different places god would come
[19:36] and meet to him in this place and in
[19:38] this place and it was all within the
[19:39] promise
[19:40] all within the land amen god would begin
[19:43] to come and meet with him from this
[19:45] place to this place of this place
[19:46] so he was walking with god he was
[19:48] walking before god
[19:49] he was obeying the word of the lord
[19:51] because the word of the lord told him
[19:53] to walk this land and as he's walking
[19:55] this land and we know that our land
[19:57] our inheritance is this word that's been
[19:59] restored
[20:00] and because he's constantly discovering
[20:02] the land communing with the lord walking
[20:04] before the lord as he walks in the land
[20:06] there is no reason for him to establish
[20:09] amen a single place of worship
[20:13] there's no reason for him to establish a
[20:15] religion to establish a city
[20:17] to establish anything because he was
[20:20] still walking the land
[20:21] and i want to say today that this bride
[20:23] is still walking the land amen
[20:25] she's walking before the lord and she's
[20:27] walking in the promises
[20:29] and still discovering all that's been
[20:30] given to her amen
[20:32] all the word that has been opened amen
[20:34] as we walk through the land amen we're
[20:36] discovering what's over the next hill
[20:37] and then the next valley and the next
[20:39] stream and the next whatever
[20:42] so there's no reason for us to settle
[20:45] down amen the the
[20:46] when you begin to settle down and build
[20:48] a city and build a singular place of
[20:50] worship
[20:51] and all of these things when you do that
[20:53] you're testifying
[20:55] that i've already walked all the land
[20:58] there is to walk
[21:02] when we when when and and listen
[21:06] the devil is trying with desperately
[21:09] trying and working with the very nature
[21:11] of man the very nature that's in you
[21:13] the wrong nature that come through
[21:16] hybridization
[21:18] trying to get us to settle down
[21:21] on these truths that we have
[21:25] just like in luther and luther's day
[21:27] just like in wesley's day just like in
[21:29] pentecostal
[21:30] let's go ahead and build a walled city
[21:34] and believe the message and from this
[21:36] walled city
[21:37] start defending the message
[21:43] and this will become our carved out
[21:45] territory
[21:47] and nobody better get into territory
[21:50] and we'll begin from here to defend
[21:53] the message because when you build a
[21:55] city you have to defend the city
[21:59] in fact when you start building a city
[22:02] you have to do a lot of work to maintain
[22:04] the city
[22:07] it takes a lot of effort to keep city
[22:09] life going
[22:11] that's religion but
[22:14] all abraham had to do was walk the land
[22:18] gather all he had and walk the land and
[22:21] discover
[22:22] all that god had promised and all that
[22:23] god had given to him amen he was there
[22:26] to walk the land to discover it and
[22:28] because he was still discovering the
[22:29] promise of god
[22:31] there was no reason for him to settle
[22:33] down
[22:35] so he would dwell in tabernacles
[22:40] oh god is good
[22:44] man is always trying to hide from god
[22:48] and make himself a way that he can feel
[22:50] justified not be justified
[22:53] feel justified and i'd like to make this
[22:55] statement
[22:56] it doesn't matter if you feel justified
[22:58] if you're not
[23:02] it doesn't matter if you feel good
[23:06] if you're not in a good place
[23:10] because you can do many religious things
[23:12] that feel good
[23:14] but feeling good is not equivalent to
[23:18] being good
[23:20] or even being right so we can't base it
[23:24] on
[23:24] feelings although the feelings are are
[23:26] are a byproduct feelings come there
[23:29] you don't can't have you can't have a a
[23:31] worship and a faith without some
[23:32] feelings coming attached to it
[23:34] but when it's based upon the feelings
[23:36] then it's easy to go into error
[23:39] so man is trying to hide from god so
[23:42] this is the purpose of religion this is
[23:44] abraham
[23:45] or adam's covering when he said he
[23:46] covered himself with his own doing his
[23:49] own making his own
[23:50] fig leaf religion he sewed it together
[23:52] and made a covering and he was hiding he
[23:54] was trying to hide his sin from god
[23:55] without an atonement
[23:58] but with his own works and when he tried
[24:00] to cover himself
[24:02] amen he's trying to make a way where he
[24:04] feels
[24:05] justified he now feels okay he now feels
[24:08] covered he said a man can feel justified
[24:12] a religion that's been a religion means
[24:15] a covering so he tried to make his own
[24:17] religion this is the nature of man
[24:21] this is what man has always tried to do
[24:22] this is what man will continue to try to
[24:24] do
[24:26] let's go to hebrews 11 and continue on
[24:29] i'm backing up just a bit but we're
[24:32] gonna we're gonna
[24:33] grab this in genesis 11.
[24:38] genesis we're going to go back to
[24:39] genesis genesis 11.
[24:48] verse 1. and the whole earth was of one
[24:52] language and of one speech
[24:54] and it came to pass as they journey from
[24:56] the east and they found a plane in the
[24:58] land of shinar and they dwelt there
[25:01] they said one to another go too let us
[25:03] make brick
[25:04] and burn them thoroughly and they had
[25:06] brick for stone and slime had they from
[25:08] order now we've been reading this and
[25:11] going through this
[25:12] and we find out that they've gathered
[25:14] themselves together now
[25:16] to build a city and a tower we'll get
[25:18] that minute but i want to back up to the
[25:20] previous verse
[25:21] and i want to talk about the the
[25:23] ringleader for all of this
[25:25] and nimrod so let's go back to
[25:30] chapter 10 and i think i want to read
[25:34] from verse 6. yeah
[25:38] and the sons of ham kush in mizrahim and
[25:41] foot
[25:42] and canaan and the sons of kush siba
[25:46] and havilah and sabtan rhema
[25:49] and these other names verse 8
[25:53] and kush begotten nimrod he began to be
[25:56] a mighty one
[25:57] in the earth i want you to catch that he
[26:00] began to be
[26:01] this is something new that's happening
[26:03] amen this is the first time this is
[26:06] mentioned in the genealogies we don't
[26:07] have any of this description
[26:09] so the bible is written in a way to
[26:10] catch your attention to draw you into
[26:12] something
[26:13] and so now this one is going to rise up
[26:16] to be over the others amen
[26:18] and krishna got nimrod and he began to
[26:20] be a mighty one
[26:22] in the earth you know what this tells me
[26:25] when i read this
[26:26] what i take away is i don't want to be a
[26:28] mighty one in the earth
[26:31] but that's the desire of man man's
[26:33] always promoting himself and one's
[26:34] trying to climb over top the other
[26:36] amen but i don't want to be a mighty one
[26:38] in the earth amen
[26:39] i want to be one of those that are from
[26:41] heaven and i want to be one of those
[26:43] whose name is written in heaven amen
[26:45] on the lamb's book of life that's what
[26:47] matters to me
[26:49] and kush begotten imran he began to be a
[26:51] mighty one in the earth he was a mighty
[26:53] hunter before the lord before it
[26:55] wherefore it is said even as nimrod the
[26:57] mighty hunter before the lord
[27:00] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[27:02] babel and eric
[27:04] and akkad and kaunai in the land of
[27:06] shinar
[27:07] out of that land went forth asher and
[27:09] built in nineveh
[27:10] and the city the city rehoboth and kayla
[27:14] and risen between nineveh and kela the
[27:16] same as a great city
[27:19] so this is injected into the genealogies
[27:23] and this injection is for a purpose amen
[27:26] we find out that he was a mighty hunter
[27:29] before the lord
[27:30] and so there's many ways that you can
[27:32] read this in many takes on
[27:34] on how you can interpret this but but
[27:36] plain and simply he said he was a mighty
[27:38] hunter before the lord or in the
[27:40] presence of the lord
[27:41] and you can see how there there could be
[27:44] a deception
[27:45] amen and a misunderstanding of his might
[27:49] in the source of his might
[27:51] and his strength and the source of his
[27:53] strength amen just like
[27:55] lamech lamech would begin to find that
[27:58] that you know
[27:59] if if cain uh was protected by the lord
[28:02] and vengeance would be taken sevenfold
[28:05] on amanda to destroy cain
[28:06] now that i have murdered a man to defend
[28:10] myself
[28:12] see this is always the issue he was
[28:14] defending himself
[28:15] he's killed a man to my hurt amen and he
[28:18] said now
[28:18] if cain be avenged seven times then
[28:22] lamech 70 times seven you know
[28:24] he's he's he's taking the same promise
[28:26] as though it's a good thing
[28:28] as though he's in the righteous line as
[28:30] though he's under the protection of god
[28:32] amen and that very generation would be
[28:34] the generation that's destroyed by the
[28:36] flood
[28:36] and now we have nimrod amen he's coming
[28:39] he's a descendant of noah amen he come
[28:42] from noah
[28:43] to ham to nimrod that's what the
[28:45] genealogies say
[28:48] and so now he's got this genealogy amen
[28:52] that that he he is in the right line
[28:55] amen let's just say it that way
[28:57] and becomes to become a mighty one and
[28:59] then he becomes a mighty hunter
[29:01] before the lord and you can see how
[29:03] there would be a misunderstanding of
[29:05] where all his might and his talents and
[29:07] his strengths
[29:07] and his abilities came from
[29:12] and it became a a justification or
[29:15] maybe even a vindication
[29:20] so nimrod became the mighty one and he
[29:23] went out
[29:24] and he established all these cities and
[29:26] he had a large kingdom
[29:28] this was apparently not the case before
[29:31] amen after the flood because it was
[29:33] mentioned here this way
[29:34] he begins to establish an empire
[29:38] and brother branham said in god's chosen
[29:41] place of worship
[29:42] he said nothing is typed in the old
[29:44] testament anywhere in the bible
[29:45] of the church but the forced unity at
[29:48] babel
[29:49] tower we're showing
[29:52] the church the the modern uh uh idea of
[29:56] church and denomination
[29:57] brother says not listed in the bible
[29:59] only
[30:00] in the forced unity of the bible tower
[30:03] and let's go back and read our scripture
[30:05] again let's go back to chapter 11.
[30:08] verse 3 and they said one to another
[30:11] go to let us make brick and burn them
[30:13] thoroughly and they had brick for stone
[30:15] and slime had they for mortar
[30:17] and they said go to let us build us a
[30:20] city and the tower whose top may reach
[30:22] into heaven
[30:23] and let us make us a name lest we be
[30:26] scattered abroad upon the face
[30:28] of the whole earth so they wanted
[30:31] they wanted here a city
[30:34] and the tower to protect themselves
[30:38] from being scattered on the whole earth
[30:41] which was
[30:41] contrary to the commandment of god
[30:43] because god told him to multiply and
[30:45] replenish the whole earth
[30:46] he wanted them to go out and reestablish
[30:49] the earth amen
[30:50] but they wanted to gather themselves
[30:52] together and then in case
[30:54] they wanted to build for themselves a
[30:55] name now they're no longer promoting the
[30:57] name of the lord
[30:59] now they want to build for themselves
[31:00] the name and brother bam saying this
[31:02] is the picture of church of denomination
[31:07] he wanted to build for herself a name
[31:09] lest
[31:10] they be scattered upon the earth so
[31:13] they're going to gather themselves
[31:14] together
[31:15] to make a name for themselves and to
[31:17] protect themselves
[31:18] and now the religion
[31:22] the religion becomes the mechanism by
[31:26] which they deny the word
[31:31] and the religion becomes their
[31:33] protection
[31:35] from the word
[31:38] it becomes a barrier to the word or
[31:41] protection from the word
[31:43] and now the walled city listen
[31:47] the walled city
[31:52] the walled city in israel when you
[31:55] gave up your inheritance in israel
[31:59] to move to a walled city because
[32:02] when they come into the land of uh and
[32:04] when they come into the land of canaan
[32:06] and they divided up the land to israel
[32:08] everybody got a portion of land amen and
[32:10] they got a portion uh
[32:11] by lots according to the size of their
[32:12] family and the size of their tribe they
[32:14] were given a portion and that portion
[32:16] was their land
[32:16] and we know that that was super symbolic
[32:18] and very important
[32:20] because uh naboth would not give up his
[32:23] inheritance although
[32:24] abel uh um not able ahab
[32:28] offered him more money and another piece
[32:30] of land that was better
[32:32] it wasn't the quality of the land that
[32:34] naboth wanted
[32:35] it was the promise of his fathers amen
[32:37] that he was holding on to
[32:38] his portion that god placed him in
[32:42] and ahab offered him a better portion
[32:46] and more money and he said
[32:50] far be it for me i will not give up the
[32:53] land of my inheritance
[32:55] so the inheritance was so important but
[32:57] if you sold your inheritance
[32:59] and you went into the walled city amen
[33:02] when there come a time of jubilee when
[33:04] everybody could go back to their
[33:05] inheritance
[33:06] you were stuck in the walled city and
[33:08] could not go back
[33:11] you see well the devil's always trying
[33:13] to get us to enter into the walled city
[33:15] amen
[33:16] to enter in and refuse the freedom that
[33:18] comes
[33:19] from redemption so
[33:24] he says now
[33:27] the church they said there's nowhere
[33:29] nothing typed in the old testament or
[33:31] anywhere in the bible of the church
[33:33] but the forced unity of babel tower
[33:35] that's the only thing that types to
[33:36] unity because it was by nimrod
[33:38] a wicked man who went out and forced all
[33:40] the little countries to come into one
[33:42] place
[33:43] in this great tower it was a religious
[33:45] worship of course
[33:46] but not considered in the word of god is
[33:49] there
[33:50] so there is where you see denominational
[33:53] religion typed
[33:54] the tower of babel in the old testament
[33:58] which is which this religion was
[34:00] certainly a religion
[34:01] but not the religion of the word of god
[34:04] so when you want to see
[34:05] denominationalism religious
[34:07] denominationalism you find it in the
[34:09] tower of bible
[34:11] in the message god's provided place of
[34:13] worship the prophet says and now
[34:14] we see this forced religion right in
[34:17] view now to bring all the little groups
[34:19] into one great unity
[34:20] they call it some of them believe in
[34:22] this and some believe in that
[34:24] some deny this and some deny that and
[34:26] the bible said how can two walk together
[34:28] except they be agreed it'll never work
[34:31] we've got to be in agreement and what in
[34:33] agreement with what
[34:34] not in agreement with one another
[34:38] this is good not in agreement with one
[34:41] another
[34:41] if we can get ourselves in agreement
[34:43] with one another that will bring a false
[34:46] unity
[34:48] catch this if we can get a little group
[34:51] of us together
[34:52] and we all agree together that agreement
[34:54] with one another will
[34:56] bring a false unity
[35:00] not in agreement with one another as
[35:03] much as we've got to be in agreement
[35:05] with the word
[35:06] with god that'll bring true unity amen
[35:12] that is what it's got to be in agreement
[35:14] with now we find out enforced unity
[35:16] was represented by groups of people at
[35:18] babylon god cannot put his name in such
[35:21] a thing as that he never did
[35:22] and he never will though they tried it
[35:24] they put their name into it
[35:26] put his name into it but it's not so
[35:33] he said in the message the god of this
[35:35] evil age
[35:36] said notice this plan to build a super
[35:39] denominational church the world council
[35:41] of churches see
[35:42] a super denominate so that all the world
[35:44] will worship him the beast under the
[35:46] name of united christianity
[35:49] would you like to read it in the bible
[35:50] revelation 13 6 8
[35:52] it's a modern tower of babylon don't you
[35:56] remember how that nimrod that hypocrite
[35:57] built the big tower
[35:59] and made all the other little cities pay
[36:01] tribute to it babel
[36:02] babel is the same thing it just changes
[36:04] its name and as it
[36:06] comes on up it's rome is now babylon
[36:09] and the whole world is brought to
[36:11] babylon and is brought in by the world
[36:13] council of the churches which will make
[36:15] every one of them bow to her and you
[36:18] took the mark of the beast not knowing
[36:20] what you're doing
[36:21] because but those who are elected will
[36:24] hear the word
[36:24] and come out of it
[36:28] as we hear the word those who are
[36:31] elected will hear the word
[36:33] and come out of it let's turn together
[36:35] to revelation 13 and read this that
[36:37] brother branham referred to
[36:52] revelation 13 and 11.
[36:56] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[36:58] of the earth and he had two horns like a
[37:00] lamb
[37:01] and he spake as a dragon we've been
[37:02] through this before brother branham is
[37:04] referring to the united states
[37:05] coming up where there's no multitudes of
[37:07] people coming up out of the land
[37:08] he had two horns like a lamb but it
[37:11] wasn't a lamb just like a lamb
[37:13] brother man said it was the buffalo the
[37:14] american buffalo said these two horns
[37:17] were
[37:17] ecclesiastical and civil and they type
[37:20] they type all the way back to the tower
[37:22] of nimrod when he said let us build a
[37:24] city civil and a tower religious
[37:28] ecclesiastical
[37:29] so we caught that because everything
[37:32] begins in genesis right
[37:33] we're firm believers of that
[37:36] and he spake as a dragon and he
[37:39] exercised all the power of the first
[37:40] beast before him
[37:42] and caused the earth and them which
[37:43] dwelt therein to worship the first beast
[37:45] whose deadly wound was healed and he
[37:48] doeth great wonder so that he maketh
[37:50] fire come down from heaven on the earth
[37:52] in the sight of men
[37:53] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[37:55] earth by the means of those miracles
[37:56] which he had power to do in the sight of
[37:58] the beast
[37:59] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[38:01] that they should make an image to the
[38:03] beast
[38:04] all right now the beast system is the
[38:06] catholic church amen and so now
[38:08] he this this american system
[38:12] is going to convince the world to make
[38:15] an image to the beast and brother ben
[38:17] said a world council of churches
[38:19] or a union an image to the beast which
[38:23] had the wound by a sword and did live
[38:25] and he had power to give life into the
[38:28] image of the beast
[38:30] that the image of the beast should both
[38:33] speak
[38:33] and cause that as many as would not
[38:35] worship the image of the beast
[38:36] should be killed you know there's some
[38:39] people out there there's some in
[38:40] religious circles that teach
[38:41] that there's going to be actually a
[38:43] statue made and and and
[38:45] be a man of sin that will give life to
[38:47] this
[38:50] it's all spiritual religious amen
[38:53] it's a unified you know when god came
[38:56] down and he confounded the languages of
[38:57] the
[38:58] tower of babylon now they could not
[38:59] comprehend or understand one another
[39:01] amen and they separated themselves out
[39:03] to actually perform the word of god by
[39:05] scattering and multiplying greatly upon
[39:07] the earth
[39:08] amen they could not communicate or
[39:10] understand they
[39:11] they didn't understand one another and
[39:14] because they didn't understand one
[39:15] another they left
[39:16] off building the city because it wasn't
[39:18] yet time
[39:19] amen but they're going to come back and
[39:22] finish building that city
[39:23] and that's right here at the end time
[39:26] so they left off so in order amen in
[39:30] order
[39:30] to come back they have to come back into
[39:33] a
[39:34] common understanding or a common
[39:36] language
[39:38] they say well everybody's going to speak
[39:39] english and speak dancing that's not
[39:41] google translate can take care of that
[39:44] and you wonder why google translate even
[39:46] came on the scene today
[39:47] so that we can bring everybody back to
[39:48] one language now it doesn't matter what
[39:50] language you speak
[39:52] but to me it doesn't matter you can
[39:54] still translate all the languages into
[39:56] one but if you don't understand one
[39:57] another
[39:58] you still don't come back to the common
[40:00] mind the common thinking
[40:01] the common understanding that will come
[40:03] back to start building the city again
[40:05] but what's happening in the world what
[40:08] have we seen
[40:08] amen in the last year or two amen the
[40:11] world is coming into one thinking amen
[40:14] one frame of mind and that frame of mind
[40:16] is we are all linked together
[40:18] we are all united what happens in china
[40:20] happens in america
[40:21] happens in india happens in south
[40:23] america amen we've got to do something
[40:26] to get control
[40:27] of this globe
[40:34] and now the reasoning and wisdom of man
[40:37] is now
[40:38] starting to align it's been separated by
[40:41] culture it's been separated by language
[40:43] it's been separated from by boundaries
[40:44] for so many years
[40:46] but what we're watching is a common
[40:48] understanding coming into man
[40:53] to where they're beginning to understand
[40:55] one another again
[41:00] do you see it they're beginning
[41:03] to think alike beginning to comprehend
[41:08] one another again
[41:13] and now what would it do all that they
[41:15] imagined to do
[41:17] because that's what was stopped
[41:20] and so now they're going to continue to
[41:24] build the city
[41:26] let me just keep reading and finish this
[41:28] passage of scripture
[41:32] and he had power to give life into the
[41:35] image of the beast
[41:36] so this union this world council church
[41:39] this union
[41:40] and then they'll take full control it is
[41:43] america the beast that rose out of the
[41:44] land
[41:45] amen that will give power amen that it
[41:49] should
[41:50] both live and speak amen because without
[41:53] a powerful backing
[41:57] what power does the united nations have
[41:59] if you take away the main players
[42:01] in fact without the without the united
[42:03] states for a long period of time the
[42:05] united nations would have had
[42:07] no power no authority
[42:10] so it's the same thing amen now this
[42:13] beast that come out of the land with
[42:15] like a lamb with two horns
[42:17] it'll actually give power unto this
[42:20] world council of churches there's a
[42:21] unification
[42:22] of faith it will give it will give a
[42:25] power to it that it can both
[42:26] live and speak
[42:30] and how does it give power because it
[42:33] becomes the enforcing
[42:35] agent
[42:39] amen in verse 15 he had power to give
[42:44] life into the image of the beast
[42:45] that the image of the beast should both
[42:46] speak and cause it as many as would not
[42:48] worship the image of the beast
[42:50] should be killed and he caused all
[42:53] both small and great rich and poor free
[42:56] and bond
[42:57] to receive a mark in their right hand
[43:00] are in their foreheads
[43:04] and that no man might buy or sell say
[43:06] that he had the mark or the name of the
[43:08] beast
[43:08] or the number of his name here heareth
[43:11] wisdom let him that have understanding
[43:13] count the number of the beast
[43:14] for it is the number of a man and his
[43:17] number is six hundred
[43:18] three score and six
[43:23] here's what brother branham says in a
[43:25] couple of places
[43:26] this is the message what shall i do with
[43:28] this jesus called christ in 63 says and
[43:30] here
[43:31] we are today forming a system a system
[43:33] we can't
[43:34] we tried to make everybody become a
[43:36] lutheran
[43:37] and couldn't do it tried to make them
[43:40] all become baptist
[43:41] we couldn't do it all become a methodist
[43:44] they're all become pentecostals they
[43:45] couldn't do it
[43:46] so to order to do this the time is so
[43:48] short they have formed a council ahead
[43:51] an image to the beast
[43:52] that's exactly what they've done and
[43:55] brother man i'm saying
[43:56] because they couldn't unify on
[43:59] doctrine
[44:02] they'll become another unification which
[44:05] is a system
[44:06] and that system will unify them listen
[44:10] and they can keep their doctrine
[44:16] you can keep your doctrine if you want
[44:19] to believe
[44:20] in a prophet you can believe in joseph
[44:22] smith or ellen white or william branham
[44:27] if you want to baptize in in jesus name
[44:30] or you want to baptize in titles you're
[44:31] going to do it three times forward or
[44:33] three times backwards
[44:36] you can keep your doctrine
[44:39] but you still have to come into the
[44:41] system
[44:44] there's a deception because you don't
[44:46] have to
[44:47] to drop your teaching your doctrine
[44:53] unless your doctrine's against the
[44:54] system
[44:59] and you can come into this union this
[45:01] boycott or this union
[45:03] this system
[45:06] and so because they could not unify on
[45:09] doctrine
[45:11] now the catholic church has the roman
[45:12] spirit and the roman spirit
[45:14] continued in the catholic church in in
[45:17] rome didn't mind
[45:18] what god you worshipped you catch this
[45:23] it was herod amen who was a who was a
[45:26] proxy king
[45:27] under under caesar under the roman
[45:30] government
[45:31] that rebuilt the temple for the jews
[45:35] and rome didn't care that they rebuilt
[45:37] the temple
[45:38] because rome didn't mind which gods you
[45:41] worshiped
[45:42] as long as you come under the roman
[45:44] system
[45:46] and if you were under the roman system
[45:48] you could keep your gods
[45:51] but you could not reject the system
[45:55] if you rejected the system there was a
[45:58] problem
[45:58] but you could you could worship your
[46:00] gods
[46:02] and rome would conquer and as rome would
[46:05] begin to conquer
[46:06] other places amen they would allow them
[46:09] to keep their gods in fact what they
[46:11] would do is say you can keep your gods
[46:12] and we got more for you too if you want
[46:14] more
[46:18] you can keep your false doctrine but we
[46:19] got more for you if you want more
[46:24] and so now that roman spirit come into
[46:26] the catholic church
[46:28] and at first the catholic church started
[46:30] conquering
[46:31] and trying to bring a forced unity where
[46:33] everybody believed the same thing
[46:35] but that fell through the protestant
[46:36] movement so they changed their tactics
[46:38] amen
[46:39] and now amen that spirit that was moving
[46:42] the catholic church
[46:43] amen began to move into the
[46:44] denominations and now you can believe
[46:47] differently you can keep your doctrine
[46:52] but come into the system what system
[46:56] the roman system which is an antichrist
[46:58] system which goes all the way back to
[47:00] cain
[47:03] it's the cane system
[47:06] and so now it doesn't matter what you
[47:08] believe we can't
[47:10] unify on belief so we will unify for a
[47:12] common purpose a meant for a unity to
[47:15] become one
[47:16] amen to do what to protect ourselves
[47:19] because we're destroying ourselves and
[47:22] it's obvious that man is destroying
[47:24] himself brother branham said god
[47:25] man destroys himself and now we have to
[47:28] find a mechanism by which
[47:29] we can now protect ourselves
[47:34] and we will unify under the common goal
[47:38] of self-protection and self-preservation
[47:41] and that self-protection and
[47:42] self-preservation we would try to be the
[47:45] very attempt
[47:46] to keep the word of god
[47:49] from taking effect or from people
[47:51] obeying the word of god
[47:52] it becomes a barrier to the people
[47:57] brother brahm says in another message in
[47:59] 1964 what shall we do with this jesus
[48:02] called christ
[48:03] so now it's about to reach its final
[48:06] goal again the crucial hours here again
[48:08] what is it
[48:09] crucify him we can't all make them all
[48:11] methodists we can't make them all
[48:13] baptist we can't make all
[48:14] oneness we can't make them all trinity
[48:16] we can't make them all this that or the
[48:18] other
[48:18] but we can have a council where you
[48:20] disagree as far as the east is from the
[48:22] west
[48:23] and the whole thing is wrong it's a
[48:25] satellite to rome
[48:27] that's exactly right
[48:31] and so coming back
[48:35] to where he caused those to have a mark
[48:38] in their head are in their hand
[48:42] brother brandon mentions this in the
[48:43] message the mark of the beast from 54
[48:46] and he says now you see what the mark of
[48:47] the beast is is the mark of apostasy
[48:51] it's a person who just think that well i
[48:53] belong to church
[48:54] i'm just as good as the next fellow i'm
[48:56] not i belong to this church
[48:58] and you realize where your church
[48:59] organization that you're depending on
[49:00] where it come from
[49:02] do you realize the bible said he that
[49:04] worshipped the beast received his mark
[49:05] or the letter of his name now in the
[49:08] forehead or hand
[49:09] that's knowledge or deed that don't mean
[49:12] you get a big tattoo on your face
[49:14] it don't have to be that it's not
[49:15] talking the outward it's talking of
[49:17] spiritual
[49:19] in 1960 says now i want just for the
[49:23] squeezing down part
[49:26] before we leave in the next few minutes
[49:28] now the seal of god is the holy spirit
[49:31] all know that don't you all right we all
[49:33] know that that the seal of god is the
[49:35] holy spirit
[49:36] you take revelation 9 1-4 you'll find
[49:39] that they all had the seal in their
[49:40] forehead first corinthians 1 22 paul
[49:42] said
[49:43] whereby he has sealed us by his holy
[49:45] spirit unto the day
[49:46] ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy
[49:49] spirit that's the angel that come forth
[49:51] sealing upon their forehead
[49:53] now that doesn't mean you he takes and
[49:56] puts a spot on there
[49:59] your forehead is your revelation
[50:03] and your hand is the thing you do about
[50:06] it
[50:08] it's a spiritual mark
[50:11] he don't take a big stamp and stamp you
[50:14] like that
[50:16] it's a spiritual mark because the
[50:18] spiritual mark
[50:20] it marks what what for the holy ghost
[50:24] it's your revelation and then what you
[50:28] do about your revelation
[50:30] is the mark of the head and the mark in
[50:32] the hand
[50:33] it's a spiritual mark showing your
[50:36] revelation
[50:36] and your action are aligned and you have
[50:38] the holy ghost
[50:40] you're under the seal but under the
[50:43] the false seal of a false union
[50:46] there's also a mark and in that mark it
[50:50] has to do with your
[50:51] intellectual agreement
[50:55] your intellectual agreement and
[50:58] or what you do your action
[51:02] with the system
[51:06] see you don't actually have to agree
[51:09] with the system
[51:11] to be marked you can have some
[51:14] disagreements with the system
[51:17] but if the system is set in such a way
[51:19] that your
[51:20] your commerce your ability to buy and
[51:22] sell and trade or
[51:23] survive upon the earth as man normally
[51:25] survives if that is now
[51:27] threatened although you're not in
[51:28] agreement with the system but you still
[51:31] are a contributor or participator
[51:33] you're still participating in the system
[51:35] then you receive the protection
[51:37] of the system or the protection of the
[51:40] mark
[51:44] because cain was protected under his
[51:46] mark
[51:48] but but it could look like cain that god
[51:50] agreed with cain and cain said my
[51:52] judgment is too much whoever finds me
[51:53] will kill me and he says oh yeah you're
[51:54] right i'll take vengeance upon them and
[51:56] mark them that nobody should kill them
[51:58] it looked as if god amen had went
[52:01] back on his judgment and he accepted
[52:03] cain and he and he pardoned cain and he
[52:06] protected cain
[52:07] but that's not true he marked cain
[52:09] because it wasn't yet time
[52:11] he had more seed that had to come forth
[52:13] in the redemption he
[52:14] marked him to a later judgment he just
[52:17] deferred
[52:18] judgment so his mark was his protection
[52:23] but it was not his vindication and there
[52:25] was no real safety
[52:27] from eternal damnation in that mark
[52:31] so there's another mark coming up on the
[52:33] earth so don't
[52:34] look friends don't look for a time when
[52:37] they're going to become a mark
[52:39] and what is the mark don't worry about
[52:41] the mark the mark is here
[52:44] the mark is here it's a it's an
[52:46] intellectual agreement you identify with
[52:49] the doctrine you identify with the
[52:51] understanding
[52:52] of the system and you agree with the
[52:54] system
[52:55] amen and even if you don't agree with it
[52:57] but for personal
[52:58] convenience and personal preservation
[53:01] amen
[53:01] you you participate in the system
[53:07] that's the mark and the mark is here
[53:10] the mark of god is here the mark of the
[53:13] beast is here
[53:16] both of them are for protection
[53:20] one of them is self-preservation and one
[53:23] of them is a self-surrender
[53:27] to where under the mark of the of god i
[53:30] surrendered my life i died to myself
[53:32] i received the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:34] and now it's not my life it's his
[53:35] i've been bought with the price amen
[53:37] it's not my life it's his life in me
[53:39] and i may not be able under this mark to
[53:43] preserve my welfare i may not be able to
[53:45] preserve my
[53:46] income i may may not be able to preserve
[53:48] my comfort my preserve my friendships
[53:50] preserve my emotions
[53:51] but i surrender all that for no
[53:53] self-preservation to take the mark of
[53:55] god
[53:56] it's a total surrender and abandonment
[53:58] to self but the mark of the beast is all
[54:01] about
[54:01] self-preservation so i don't lose my
[54:03] relationships my friendships my family
[54:08] my economics my my my means of living
[54:11] amen it's
[54:12] all self-preservation these two marks
[54:16] one is self-abandonment trusting god and
[54:19] one is a lack of faith in god and
[54:20] self-preservation
[54:23] don't look for a mark to mark us here
[54:28] take the mark of god abandon your life
[54:31] quit trying to preserve our life if you
[54:34] save your life
[54:35] you'll lose it but if you lose your life
[54:37] for my sake you shall find it
[54:40] the way up is down it's always opposite
[54:43] to carnal reasoning when you start
[54:44] dealing with god
[54:47] let's go back to genesis chapter 11.
[55:00] genesis chapter 11 verse 5.
[55:07] and the lord came down to see the city
[55:10] and the tower which the children and men
[55:12] builded
[55:13] and the lord said behold the people is
[55:15] one and they have all one language and
[55:17] this they begin to do
[55:18] and now nothing will be restrained from
[55:20] them when they have what they have
[55:22] which they have imagined to do look at
[55:25] the world we live in
[55:28] the imagination they're contemplating
[55:30] colonizing mars
[55:37] i mean artificial intelligence
[55:43] that becomes scary
[55:46] that can your phone that can hear you
[55:48] have a conversation
[55:49] and you can say something about you know
[55:52] what i
[55:53] next time i'm at the store i need to get
[55:55] xyz and the next time you open up your
[55:57] phone
[55:58] there's an advertisement for that thing
[55:59] you just mentioned
[56:05] artificial intelligence is scary
[56:08] driverless cars and blah blah blah blah
[56:10] blah and all the things that you can
[56:12] mention
[56:12] why it shows that man is coming back to
[56:15] a
[56:16] common understanding because when he
[56:19] comes back to a unity and a common
[56:21] understanding
[56:22] he can do everything that he's imagined
[56:24] in his heart to do
[56:28] this is where we live
[56:31] let's read that again verse 6 and lord
[56:33] said behold the people is one
[56:35] and they have all one language and this
[56:36] they begin to do and now nothing will be
[56:38] restrained from them which they have
[56:40] imagined to do
[56:41] go to let us go down there confound
[56:43] their language and they may not
[56:45] understand one another's speech
[56:47] that was god protecting the elect from
[56:50] the system
[56:55] that when god came down and scattered he
[56:57] was forcing them to keep his word
[56:59] but what he was he trying to do he was
[57:01] trying to get abraham
[57:02] out of that system and get him to
[57:03] himself so that he could have a
[57:05] relationship with abraham
[57:07] so he could reveal himself to abraham so
[57:09] he was breaking up the system
[57:11] but now we've come to a day where god
[57:13] has come down through his word
[57:15] and his word comes to the full
[57:17] revelation of the mystery of god
[57:19] is now revealed and under that mystery
[57:21] amen there's a protection for the
[57:23] believer there's a word that has come
[57:25] and the word has come to bring
[57:27] protection against the system
[57:30] the seals was to show amen the the
[57:33] opening of the seals was to show
[57:35] the antichrist spirit the weaving of two
[57:38] spirits through the church ages
[57:39] was to show the horse riders the
[57:41] anointing on the false vine
[57:43] was to show the whole mechanism of the
[57:45] devil trying to use religion
[57:47] and now trying to use every age trying
[57:49] to use the current present day truth
[57:52] to deceive by
[57:55] you know what he's done he's jumped on
[57:57] board every age and then brought a
[57:59] deception
[57:59] every eighth broader deception every age
[58:01] brought a deception god back
[58:03] all the way back in genesis 11 he come
[58:04] and he broke it up amen for the
[58:06] protection of the elect so its plan of
[58:08] redemption can move forward
[58:11] but at the end time he's not going to
[58:14] stop it now because he's released a word
[58:16] that'll be a protection for his people
[58:20] he's already built for us a tower
[58:26] because christ the lord is a strong
[58:28] tower that the righteous run into
[58:31] and are safe he's already in this day
[58:34] provided an
[58:35] ark he built the ark he's built the
[58:37] tower we have a place of safety
[58:39] and now that the ark is finished amen
[58:42] now that the tower is constructed
[58:44] amen now he can take the bands that were
[58:47] on
[58:47] amen nimrod's kingdom he could take his
[58:50] bands off
[58:51] of babylon he's always destroyed babylon
[58:53] destroyed babylon destroyed babylon
[58:56] and that spirit that moved down he would
[58:58] disrupt it and disrupt it and disrupt it
[59:00] and mr can keep gathering his elect
[59:02] but now at the end time he won't disrupt
[59:04] it anymore
[59:05] now he will pull back he will allow them
[59:07] to come into a common language a common
[59:09] understanding
[59:10] a common mode of thinking so they can do
[59:12] all that they've imagined in their heart
[59:13] and he's not going to disrupt it this
[59:15] time until he's finished his plan of
[59:17] redemption
[59:18] and removed his bride and then he will
[59:20] pass a judgment on the whole thing
[59:24] but he will remove his bride first
[59:26] that's why there's a call in the land
[59:28] that says come out from among her
[59:29] my people it says come out from among
[59:33] them and be
[59:34] separate and touch not of the unclean
[59:36] thing and i will receive you
[59:38] that voice is gone in this day and
[59:40] continues through the bride
[59:42] calling come out come out come out
[59:44] there's an ark come
[59:46] into the ark of safety amen which is
[59:48] christ himself
[59:52] christ has come there's a safety place
[59:55] on the earth now let me finish
[59:59] reading here
[1:00:02] verse 17 go to let us go down in there
[1:00:04] and confound their language and they may
[1:00:06] not understand one another speech
[1:00:08] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:00:10] thence upon the face of all the earth
[1:00:11] and they left off to build the city
[1:00:14] therefore is the name of it called babel
[1:00:16] because the lord did there confound the
[1:00:18] language of all the earth
[1:00:19] and from thence did the lord scatter
[1:00:21] them abroad upon
[1:00:23] the face of the earth
[1:00:26] then we know that from there you know
[1:00:29] terror comes down brother
[1:00:30] said tara comes down out of babylon
[1:00:32] comes to the city of ur
[1:00:34] he's dwelling in ur and then god speaks
[1:00:36] to abraham
[1:00:38] to separate and they he begins then tara
[1:00:40] takes them up and they move up
[1:00:42] to haran or haran i don't know exactly
[1:00:44] how to pronounce it but they begin to
[1:00:45] move up to northern mesopotamia
[1:00:48] and terror dies and abraham moves on and
[1:00:50] lot goes with him and
[1:00:51] we've got all the journeys we've talked
[1:00:53] about all that and finally in the last
[1:00:54] separation
[1:00:55] when lot separates himself out to pitch
[1:00:57] against sodom and go
[1:00:58] finally wind up in sodom abraham is
[1:01:01] there left alone with god
[1:01:02] and when god finally got abraham to a
[1:01:05] separated place
[1:01:07] god finally revealed to him the full
[1:01:10] extent of the promise
[1:01:12] it's here it's there it's here it's
[1:01:14] there now walk you in it amen
[1:01:17] and that's what abraham did and so we
[1:01:19] know that promise was to abraham to a
[1:01:20] seed and we know there comes isaac and
[1:01:22] i'm fast forwarding here
[1:01:24] isaac to jacob to the 12 princes of
[1:01:26] israel amen and we come all the way down
[1:01:28] through now they
[1:01:30] they go down at a time of famine into
[1:01:32] egypt
[1:01:34] because abraham in a time of famine went
[1:01:37] down to egypt
[1:01:40] we always think this is the first time
[1:01:41] something's happening
[1:01:44] solomon killed that he said there's
[1:01:46] nothing new under the sun what it has
[1:01:47] been before
[1:01:50] so now abraham in a time of famine went
[1:01:53] down
[1:01:53] and sojourned into egypt and then
[1:01:55] eventually abraham's presence became a
[1:01:57] curse to them in egypt
[1:01:59] and pharaoh forced him out amen when he
[1:02:01] forced him out he spoiled pharaoh and
[1:02:03] all the goods and he went out wealthy
[1:02:06] do you see the pattern now the children
[1:02:08] of israel will come down in the time of
[1:02:10] famine
[1:02:11] they will come down amen and eventually
[1:02:13] their presence becomes a curse
[1:02:15] amen to egypt and the pharaoh pharaoh
[1:02:17] forces the mount
[1:02:18] when he forces them out they go out
[1:02:20] wealthy
[1:02:22] and god now is calling them out because
[1:02:26] he he made a promise to abraham and he
[1:02:28] made that promise to abraham under
[1:02:30] separation
[1:02:30] he wanted abraham he wanted to select
[1:02:33] abraham
[1:02:34] and he wanted abraham to be separated
[1:02:36] unto him and he wanted to reveal himself
[1:02:38] to abraham so abraham became the light
[1:02:42] of his day
[1:02:46] and so now god has not forgot his
[1:02:49] promise
[1:02:50] now they're in egypt he's going to bring
[1:02:51] him out of egypt with a mighty hand
[1:02:53] but what he wants to do is he's trying
[1:02:55] to separate a nation out of a nation
[1:02:58] and he's going to separate them unto
[1:03:01] himself
[1:03:02] showing that out of the church ages he's
[1:03:04] going to bring a church out of a church
[1:03:06] he's going to bring a bride out of a
[1:03:07] church
[1:03:07] and he wants to bring that bride unto
[1:03:09] himself so first he takes them out into
[1:03:12] the wilderness
[1:03:15] separated from all other cities and all
[1:03:18] other civilizations
[1:03:20] amen because he wants there to wash them
[1:03:22] with his word
[1:03:23] and he wants to be married to them
[1:03:26] and then in the honeymoon he wants to
[1:03:30] take them to the land of canaan that he
[1:03:32] promised and he wants to positionally
[1:03:34] place them in the land
[1:03:35] and he wants the land to come under his
[1:03:37] influence
[1:03:38] completely through these people that
[1:03:40] he's chosen
[1:03:41] until the whole land that he's given to
[1:03:43] them becomes
[1:03:44] god's it is god's land but now there's a
[1:03:47] people on there that he can work through
[1:03:48] that'll purge out
[1:03:50] all the inhabitants kick out all the
[1:03:51] trash run out
[1:03:53] all the devils so that the only thing
[1:03:54] there will be the light of god
[1:03:57] this was god's plan but man has always
[1:04:00] ruined god's plan but you can see by
[1:04:01] god's plan
[1:04:02] what he wants to do so god calls him
[1:04:05] unto himself and he brings them to
[1:04:07] himself
[1:04:08] amen and they refuse him but he
[1:04:10] continues on with the plan
[1:04:11] he brings him across jordan and he says
[1:04:13] i will drive out all these inhabitants
[1:04:15] and go you now and drive them out
[1:04:18] so god is in partnership with man
[1:04:22] he's promised that he'll do the driving
[1:04:24] out but you've got to go drive them out
[1:04:27] meaning you've got to get into action
[1:04:29] and then he'll back up your action and
[1:04:31] he'll move them
[1:04:32] but when you operate by faith so
[1:04:36] so there's a couple scriptures i want to
[1:04:39] read together let's go to
[1:04:40] first chronicles i'm trying to lay a
[1:04:43] foundation for something i want to get
[1:04:45] to here
[1:04:49] chronicles 17.
[1:05:05] i never read my scriptures off my notes
[1:05:08] i look them up in my bible
[1:05:09] because it makes me slow down so that i
[1:05:13] can
[1:05:13] we can all go together first chronicles
[1:05:16] 17
[1:05:20] 20.
[1:05:22] first chronicles 17 20 o lord there is
[1:05:25] none like thee neither is there any god
[1:05:27] beside thee according to all that we
[1:05:30] have heard with our
[1:05:30] ears and what one nation in the earth is
[1:05:33] like thy people israel whom god went to
[1:05:36] redeem
[1:05:37] to be his own people to make them a name
[1:05:39] of greatness and terribleness by driving
[1:05:41] out the nations from before thee
[1:05:43] thy people from whom thou hast redeemed
[1:05:47] out of egypt for thy people israel dits
[1:05:49] down make thine
[1:05:50] own people forever and thou lord
[1:05:54] become us their god so this was god's
[1:05:57] goal he wanted to make them a great
[1:05:59] nation a great people
[1:06:00] to declare his glory
[1:06:04] and brother brown tells us in the
[1:06:06] message the voice of the sign i just
[1:06:07] quoted it
[1:06:08] he said yeah there is a wonderful type
[1:06:11] that sure
[1:06:11] don't want to miss god was bringing
[1:06:14] israel's people out of a nation a nation
[1:06:16] out of a nation
[1:06:17] a nation out of a nation a beautiful
[1:06:19] type of today that god is calling his
[1:06:21] bride
[1:06:22] out of a church christian bride out of a
[1:06:24] christian church
[1:06:28] a bride church out of a church which is
[1:06:30] called the bride referred
[1:06:32] to so god is running parallels here
[1:06:35] now let's go back to exodus 34 and read
[1:06:38] another scripture
[1:06:44] exodus 34
[1:06:52] exodus 34 and verse 10.
[1:07:03] in verse 10 and he said behold i make a
[1:07:05] covenant before all thy people
[1:07:08] i will do marvels such as have not been
[1:07:10] done in all the earth nor in
[1:07:11] any nation and all the people among
[1:07:13] which thou art shall see the work of the
[1:07:15] lord for it is a terrible thing that i
[1:07:17] will do with thee
[1:07:19] observe thou that which i command thee
[1:07:20] this day behold i drive out
[1:07:23] before thee the amorite the canaanite
[1:07:25] the hivite the parasite
[1:07:27] and the hivite in the jebusite take heed
[1:07:30] to thyself lest thou make a covenant
[1:07:32] with the inhabitants of the land
[1:07:34] whether thou goest lest it be for a
[1:07:36] snare in the midst of thee
[1:07:38] but ye shall destroy their altars break
[1:07:40] their images and cut down their groves
[1:07:42] for thou shalt worship no other god for
[1:07:44] the lord whose name is jealous
[1:07:46] is a jealous god lest thou make a
[1:07:49] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[1:07:50] land and they go
[1:07:51] whoring after their gods and do
[1:07:53] sacrifice unto their gods
[1:07:54] and one call thee and thou eat of his
[1:07:56] sacrifice
[1:07:58] and thou take of their daughters unto
[1:07:59] thy sons and their daughters go
[1:08:01] whoring after their gods and make thy
[1:08:03] sons go whoring after their gods
[1:08:04] thou shalt make thou shalt make the no
[1:08:08] molten image so he's bringing them into
[1:08:11] the land and he's commanding them
[1:08:14] not he's commanding them to drive out
[1:08:17] everything get it all out of the land
[1:08:20] drive out every demon
[1:08:21] every denominational idea amen every
[1:08:24] false union
[1:08:25] drive it all out and don't make any more
[1:08:28] unions with any of it because it'll trip
[1:08:30] you up
[1:08:32] he wants a total separation from all
[1:08:34] unbelief
[1:08:35] and he wants this to be a peculiar
[1:08:37] people a chosen nation
[1:08:39] and he wants to shine his light through
[1:08:41] them
[1:08:42] and let's go to deuteronomy 11.
[1:08:51] deuteronomy chapter 11. i want to read
[1:08:53] one verse there
[1:08:59] deuteronomy 11 and 24.
[1:09:06] in deuteronomy 11 24 says every place
[1:09:09] wherein the soles of your feet shall
[1:09:11] tread
[1:09:12] shall be yours from the wilderness in
[1:09:14] lebanon from the river
[1:09:16] the river euphrates even unto the
[1:09:17] uttermost sea shall be your coast
[1:09:21] so when god brought them into this land
[1:09:25] he gave them defined boundaries
[1:09:29] and in these defined boundaries he
[1:09:32] told them within you know from euphrates
[1:09:35] down to the river in egypt
[1:09:36] amen uh from here all the way into the
[1:09:39] great sea
[1:09:40] he gave them a boundary and in that
[1:09:43] boundary
[1:09:44] they were to possess all of that land
[1:09:48] and in possessing all of that land see
[1:09:50] when god was dealing with israel he was
[1:09:52] dealing with them
[1:09:53] as they were one individual he was
[1:09:55] dealing with a nation but
[1:09:56] the way he deals with the nation he was
[1:09:58] dealing with them as they were one they
[1:10:00] were one people one nation his people
[1:10:02] he was dealing them one and he was
[1:10:04] bringing them into his land
[1:10:06] and he wanted them to drive out all the
[1:10:08] inhabitants of the land
[1:10:09] and to totally purge it and bring that
[1:10:12] land
[1:10:13] subject to his word so that his light
[1:10:15] would shine from this nation
[1:10:18] that's what god wanted and god
[1:10:21] wanted that light of his gospel to shine
[1:10:24] through his people to other nations
[1:10:26] and he wanted that light to be an
[1:10:28] attractant to other nations
[1:10:30] so that other nations will come to this
[1:10:32] light
[1:10:34] israel knows this they still believe
[1:10:36] this to this day amen
[1:10:38] there's prophecies concerning this for
[1:10:39] the future but but
[1:10:41] god wanted to come and take this people
[1:10:43] purge the people
[1:10:44] and take a purged people and purge the
[1:10:46] land amen
[1:10:48] and on this land with definite
[1:10:50] boundaries
[1:10:51] he wants them to go into every corner
[1:10:54] and purge out
[1:10:55] all unbelief and get it completely gone
[1:10:59] and bring this entire land or this
[1:11:02] entire nation
[1:11:03] under the word amen so now the word of
[1:11:06] god has preeminence
[1:11:08] and when the girder god has preeminence
[1:11:09] the life of god can shine forth
[1:11:13] from this nation to other nations
[1:11:17] what he did in israel he's trying to do
[1:11:19] in you
[1:11:21] he wants to come in you and he's pulling
[1:11:23] you out of egypt and bringing you to
[1:11:24] promises of word
[1:11:25] and he's giving you boundaries and that
[1:11:27] boundary is your own life amen
[1:11:29] and he wants to drive out all unbelief
[1:11:32] amen
[1:11:32] every bit of unbelief drive out of you
[1:11:35] so that he his word takes preeminence in
[1:11:38] you and when his word takes foreign it's
[1:11:40] in you the light of god the life of god
[1:11:42] shines out from you and it becomes an
[1:11:44] attractant amen that will bring the
[1:11:46] elect
[1:11:47] to your light and you realize when god
[1:11:51] gave them commandments and got them
[1:11:52] the territory he wanted to bring
[1:11:54] everything under this territory
[1:11:57] subject to the word
[1:12:00] even by force
[1:12:04] but he never gave them permission to go
[1:12:07] outside of those boundaries and conquer
[1:12:10] another people
[1:12:11] and make them believers
[1:12:15] they were never to make converts by
[1:12:20] conquest
[1:12:23] they were make converts by light
[1:12:28] and becoming the light of the world they
[1:12:31] would
[1:12:31] draw people to the light when they come
[1:12:34] to the light they would be pointed to
[1:12:36] the source of the light
[1:12:37] which was the word of god given by god
[1:12:39] himself and then they could come in
[1:12:41] contact with the light
[1:12:42] but they were never instructed by god
[1:12:45] they were never given permission
[1:12:47] ever to go beyond these boundaries to go
[1:12:49] and conquer
[1:12:50] amen to go and conquer another nation
[1:12:53] and bring them
[1:12:54] into the faith that was forbidden
[1:12:57] because
[1:12:58] that is not god's plan
[1:13:02] but that is the denominational plan that
[1:13:04] come from nimrod that's
[1:13:06] exactly what nimrod did nimrod because
[1:13:08] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[1:13:10] he would go and conquer a city or
[1:13:12] establish another kingdom
[1:13:13] and he would bring it subject unto babel
[1:13:16] bring a subject into this false unity
[1:13:18] and religion
[1:13:19] by force amen but god is never wanting
[1:13:22] to use
[1:13:23] force to gather his elect he is always
[1:13:25] gathering his elect
[1:13:26] by the shining of light and the elect
[1:13:28] are attracted to light
[1:13:30] and they move to light by free moral
[1:13:32] agency
[1:13:33] this is god's plan to redeem his
[1:13:35] children
[1:13:36] and he wants to use you and he wants you
[1:13:38] to possess your vessel
[1:13:40] and he wants you to drive by force out
[1:13:42] of your mind out of your conscience out
[1:13:44] of your life
[1:13:45] anything that's contrary to the word and
[1:13:47] bring this vessel of yours
[1:13:49] subject to the entire word that the word
[1:13:51] has preeminence so that he can shine
[1:13:53] light and the light is the life of men
[1:13:59] and by that light it'll attract
[1:14:02] the elect of god but never by
[1:14:06] conquest not to conquer
[1:14:12] in 1963 says christ is the mystery of
[1:14:15] god revealed
[1:14:17] and you see god himself making himself
[1:14:19] known and pulsating himself through the
[1:14:21] life
[1:14:22] that you're a prisoner to him you're his
[1:14:24] love prisoner
[1:14:25] the world can laugh make fun of them
[1:14:27] come on out you could go but you're a
[1:14:29] prisoner
[1:14:30] the other woman can act hollywood but
[1:14:32] not you you're a prisoner amen see
[1:14:34] you're a prisoner to christ other men
[1:14:36] can smoke and drink and carry on if they
[1:14:37] want to and call themselves christians
[1:14:39] deacons and even preachers
[1:14:41] but not you you're a prisoner a prisoner
[1:14:43] to the word
[1:14:45] yes sir making his mystery known to his
[1:14:48] bride tree redeemed by christ
[1:14:51] the second adam going back home to be
[1:14:53] restored
[1:14:54] back to the original eden free from
[1:14:56] death sickness sorrow shame
[1:14:58] going back with eternal life then listen
[1:15:02] so many people has got the wrong concept
[1:15:06] to convert people to christianity to its
[1:15:08] government is not god's thought
[1:15:10] at all you say we made converts to
[1:15:14] christianity by his governments that's
[1:15:15] not it
[1:15:16] well they're not supposed to drink
[1:15:17] they're not supposed to lie do you know
[1:15:19] the mohammedans can outshine you
[1:15:21] you know the heathen in africa then
[1:15:23] black men can they got laws among their
[1:15:25] tribes to outshine anything you can
[1:15:27] produce in christianity
[1:15:31] now notice god making himself known not
[1:15:34] we're not supposed to make converts
[1:15:37] to christianity by a government but by
[1:15:39] the revelation the christ
[1:15:41] in you as god was in christ
[1:15:44] and god was in christ christ in you
[1:15:49] how do you make converts not by conquest
[1:15:54] how do you make conquest by light
[1:15:57] which light his light his life
[1:16:00] christ in you the hope of glory when he
[1:16:02] is preeminence in you and that light is
[1:16:04] shining
[1:16:05] that becomes a bright and shining light
[1:16:07] amen and now the elect
[1:16:09] are attracted to the light this is how
[1:16:12] you make converts to christ
[1:16:13] by living the life of jesus christ by
[1:16:16] allowing him to have preeminence in you
[1:16:18] in your land amen he can take and
[1:16:20] possess you
[1:16:21] shine the light and bring an attracting
[1:16:23] power
[1:16:26] because the elect are attracted they're
[1:16:29] drawn to the light
[1:16:31] that's why i titled this i don't
[1:16:32] remember what title it is but
[1:16:34] conquered or drawn are you conquered or
[1:16:36] are you drawn
[1:16:39] he said no we're not supposed to make
[1:16:41] converse of christianity by a government
[1:16:42] but by the revelation the christ in you
[1:16:44] as god was in christ as god was in
[1:16:46] christ christ in you
[1:16:48] then what did what god did in christ
[1:16:50] christ does in you
[1:16:52] what signs did god in christ christ does
[1:16:54] in you oh isn't that beautiful
[1:16:56] oh my i like that jesus said at that day
[1:16:59] that's this day wake up call
[1:17:03] at that day that's this day at that day
[1:17:05] when this revelation is made known
[1:17:08] you will know that i am in the father
[1:17:10] the father and me i in you
[1:17:12] and you and me when the revelation is
[1:17:14] made manifest at day you that that day
[1:17:16] you shall know that i and the father are
[1:17:18] one
[1:17:19] i am in the father the father in me then
[1:17:22] when the revelation comes forth
[1:17:24] then it's i in you and you and me there
[1:17:27] you are
[1:17:30] that's it friends we're not to make
[1:17:33] converts
[1:17:34] listen you can't convert somebody to the
[1:17:37] message by
[1:17:38] conquering their intellect
[1:17:42] and we have tried and we have tried to
[1:17:46] conquer somebody's intellect
[1:17:47] by our biblical understanding being
[1:17:50] greater than their biblical
[1:17:51] understanding
[1:17:54] that's what the denominations are
[1:17:56] fighting over that's why they've got
[1:17:57] schools by the droves and seminaries and
[1:17:59] doctors
[1:18:00] and they write books and all that
[1:18:01] they're trying amen
[1:18:03] by force by a conquering power to
[1:18:06] conquer
[1:18:06] an intellect and they're trying
[1:18:10] that's what brother said all of them are
[1:18:12] trying to make them all baptists we're
[1:18:14] trying to make them all methods
[1:18:15] what are they trying to do they're
[1:18:16] trying to conquer my
[1:18:18] intellect and bring them into their
[1:18:21] walled city
[1:18:23] by conquest
[1:18:28] and they have to go by conquest because
[1:18:30] there's no drawing power by life
[1:18:35] when there's no drawing power by life
[1:18:37] you have to go by conquest
[1:18:42] so the tactic of the denomination the
[1:18:43] tactic of nimrod hey if nimrod's tower
[1:18:46] was so great he should have just built
[1:18:47] it and let everybody come to it
[1:18:52] and if your faith is so wonderful and
[1:18:53] your love of the mess is so great
[1:18:55] just shine the light and let the elect
[1:18:56] come to it
[1:18:58] you don't have to go on a conquest
[1:19:00] mission you don't have to go fighting
[1:19:01] for you don't have to go and debate say
[1:19:02] man
[1:19:03] you don't have to go challenging
[1:19:04] somebody and debating somebody and
[1:19:06] reasoning it out until you get somebody
[1:19:08] finally to say
[1:19:08] oh you're right i see that in the
[1:19:10] scripture
[1:19:12] that's not conversion
[1:19:15] that doesn't mean we don't compare
[1:19:16] scriptures we everything we do is based
[1:19:18] off the word
[1:19:19] amen but you can't convert somebody
[1:19:22] by governments and you can't convert
[1:19:26] somebody by
[1:19:26] being right or them acknowledging that
[1:19:28] you're right
[1:19:30] how do you convert them by christ in you
[1:19:32] that's how you bring a conversion to
[1:19:34] christianity
[1:19:36] they have to be drawn to the life of
[1:19:38] jesus christ
[1:19:39] and then introduced to jesus christ and
[1:19:42] you introduce them to jesus christ
[1:19:43] through the revealed word of the hour
[1:19:45] amen and they come into a union
[1:19:47] themselves separating from everything
[1:19:49] else
[1:19:49] uniting with christ giving him
[1:19:51] preeminence over their land then he
[1:19:53] begins to live his life through them
[1:19:54] and now they're another light set on a
[1:19:57] hill to draw
[1:19:58] men to him this is god's plan
[1:20:03] not the denominational idea
[1:20:06] let's turn to matthew 23.
[1:20:26] one thing i found is jesus
[1:20:30] is so how do i want to say this
[1:20:34] jesus is so available
[1:20:39] and so mindful of the prostitute and the
[1:20:43] tax collector in the
[1:20:45] fishermen
[1:20:49] but whenever he encounters a religious
[1:20:51] spirit
[1:20:55] he is sharp and accurate
[1:20:59] and he drills it down let's go to
[1:21:02] matthew 23 11.
[1:21:08] matthew 23 and 11 but he that is
[1:21:10] greatest among you shall be your servant
[1:21:12] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[1:21:14] be abased
[1:21:15] and he that shall humble himself shall
[1:21:17] be exalted
[1:21:19] but woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:21:21] hypocrites
[1:21:22] for you shut up the kingdom of heaven
[1:21:24] against men for ye neither go in
[1:21:26] yourselves
[1:21:26] neither suffer you them that are entered
[1:21:28] to go in
[1:21:31] amen heaven is consistent of the word
[1:21:34] they would not let them go into the word
[1:21:36] and neither will they themselves
[1:21:39] warn to you scribes and pharisees
[1:21:40] hypocrites for you devour widows houses
[1:21:42] and for pretense
[1:21:44] make long prayers therefore you shall
[1:21:46] receive the greater damnation
[1:21:48] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:21:50] hypocrites for you compass sea and land
[1:21:52] to make one proselyte
[1:21:54] and when he is made you make him a
[1:21:55] twofold more child of hell than
[1:21:57] yourselves
[1:22:00] what was the pharisee doing he was
[1:22:02] trying to make a convert by governments
[1:22:05] he was trying to bring him into the law
[1:22:07] amen that's what was happening to paul
[1:22:08] paul was coming and preaching a message
[1:22:10] of grace trying to show that christ
[1:22:11] fulfilled the law
[1:22:12] and under the fulfillment of the law
[1:22:14] there was a dispensation of grace given
[1:22:16] now
[1:22:16] and what followed him judaizers that
[1:22:18] were coming right back in
[1:22:20] trying to bring the people back into a
[1:22:22] form of worship form of religion form
[1:22:24] of governments
[1:22:28] that paul was not bringing them to
[1:22:31] and so he says you hypocrites you cross
[1:22:34] the sea
[1:22:35] and the land to make a process life and
[1:22:37] all you do is make him a two-for-more
[1:22:38] child of hell
[1:22:39] because you've never brought him to god
[1:22:41] you've brought him to an
[1:22:42] order you've brought him to a system
[1:22:45] because that's what they had done
[1:22:47] amen the jews had done is they had
[1:22:49] turned the law
[1:22:50] into a systematic worship they turned it
[1:22:52] into a system
[1:22:54] that by being in the system and
[1:22:55] participating in the system
[1:22:57] now you were safe behind the wall of the
[1:22:59] system
[1:23:00] and god couldn't get you
[1:23:04] that sounds odd but that's exactly what
[1:23:06] is happening
[1:23:07] amen they're trying to build a
[1:23:09] fortification against the judgment of
[1:23:11] god
[1:23:12] so that they won't be condemned so that
[1:23:13] they can feel justified
[1:23:17] so they were crossing the sea in the
[1:23:18] land to bring them
[1:23:20] into a system amen teaching that the
[1:23:22] system was security
[1:23:24] and all they did was bring them to to be
[1:23:26] a twofold more child of hell
[1:23:34] let's keep reading
[1:23:40] woe unto you blind guides
[1:23:43] which say whosoever shall swear by the
[1:23:45] temple it is nothing but whosoever shall
[1:23:47] swear
[1:23:48] by the gold of the temple he is a debtor
[1:23:50] ye fools and blind
[1:23:52] for whether is greater the gold or the
[1:23:54] temple that sanctifieth the gold
[1:23:57] they're constantly going back to their
[1:23:59] works the gold was given
[1:24:03] and now you swear by our
[1:24:06] offering and the gold was not sanctified
[1:24:11] by their offering it was sanctified by
[1:24:13] the temple
[1:24:15] but they put their works above
[1:24:17] everything else
[1:24:19] let's keep reading you'll see them and
[1:24:21] whosoever shall swear by the altar it is
[1:24:23] nothing
[1:24:24] but whosoever swears by the gift that is
[1:24:25] upon it he is guilty
[1:24:28] he fools and blind for whether is
[1:24:30] greater the gift or the altar that
[1:24:31] sanctifieth the gift
[1:24:33] they're always going back to their works
[1:24:38] and putting greater emphasis on what
[1:24:40] they've done
[1:24:41] amen and not on what god has done and
[1:24:44] what god has established it wasn't their
[1:24:46] offering
[1:24:46] amen that was sanctified it was the
[1:24:48] altar that sanctified their offering
[1:24:51] it wasn't their gold that was
[1:24:52] sanctifying the giving of gold that was
[1:24:54] sanctified
[1:24:55] it was the temple that god had
[1:24:56] established amen that was what
[1:24:58] sanctified the goal was the temple not
[1:25:00] the gold
[1:25:03] and it's not by works amen there's
[1:25:05] nothing that we can do
[1:25:06] there's nothing that we do amen that'll
[1:25:09] that
[1:25:10] that'll become great amen all we do is
[1:25:12] what god does through us that's the
[1:25:14] greater works
[1:25:16] what he does through us and so you're
[1:25:19] they're always going back
[1:25:20] to a form of idolatry
[1:25:24] and you say jews and idolatry
[1:25:28] they were strictly against it you see
[1:25:31] they may not have had a statue
[1:25:34] to burn a candle to but they were
[1:25:36] idolaters because idolatry
[1:25:38] is when you begin to worship something
[1:25:40] you made with your own
[1:25:42] hands
[1:25:46] and the thing you make with your own
[1:25:47] hands you believe
[1:25:49] represents god
[1:25:54] now do you see christian idolatry
[1:25:58] now do you see how adultery crept into
[1:26:01] the christian church
[1:26:02] now the sudden they make the system of
[1:26:05] worship
[1:26:06] now the system of worship becomes the
[1:26:09] very thing that's worshipped
[1:26:13] the form or rule or system of worship
[1:26:16] becomes the thing that's worshiped
[1:26:18] because they believe that form or system
[1:26:20] of worship
[1:26:21] represents god and now by worshiping the
[1:26:24] form or the system
[1:26:26] now they are worshiping god and right
[1:26:29] with god
[1:26:30] and it's a system that they made with
[1:26:32] their own reasoning and their own
[1:26:33] intellect it's an idol of their own
[1:26:36] making that they are now worshiping
[1:26:40] and you have christians going to church
[1:26:42] reading the bible
[1:26:45] and full-blown idolatry and there's not
[1:26:47] a statute anywhere in sight
[1:26:52] because you don't need a statute to be
[1:26:53] an idolater you just need to worship
[1:26:55] something you created with your own
[1:26:56] hands
[1:26:59] believing that that something that you
[1:27:01] made represents god
[1:27:05] this is what these jews were doing when
[1:27:08] they were crossing sea and land
[1:27:09] this is what they were doing they had
[1:27:11] their system they had taken the word of
[1:27:13] god and turned it into a religious
[1:27:15] system
[1:27:15] and now the religious system became
[1:27:18] their god
[1:27:22] because when god came in flash they
[1:27:25] rejected god to keep
[1:27:27] their system
[1:27:31] they were in full-blown idolatry
[1:27:36] worshiping their own creation and
[1:27:38] rejecting a living god
[1:27:41] and today the world is in full-blown
[1:27:44] idolatry they're rejecting the living
[1:27:48] god
[1:27:49] and worshiping amen worshiping the
[1:27:52] system of their own
[1:27:53] creation believing that it represents
[1:27:58] god
[1:28:06] amen i think that's it
[1:28:11] yeah let's just keep reading because
[1:28:12] it's good
[1:28:14] jesus is very very straight
[1:28:19] verse 20 whoso therefore shall swear by
[1:28:22] the altar sweareth by it and by all
[1:28:23] things thereon
[1:28:24] and whoso shall swear by the temple
[1:28:26] sweareth by it and by him
[1:28:28] that dwelleth thereon and he that shall
[1:28:30] swear
[1:28:31] by heaven swearth by the throne of god
[1:28:33] and by him that sitteth thereon
[1:28:35] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:28:37] hypocrites for you pay tithe the mint
[1:28:39] and anas
[1:28:40] and crewmen and have omitted the
[1:28:42] weightier matters of the law
[1:28:43] judgment mercy and faith these ought you
[1:28:46] to have done
[1:28:47] and not leave the other undone ye blind
[1:28:50] guides would strain it and that and
[1:28:51] swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and
[1:28:53] pharisees hypocrites
[1:28:55] for you make clean the outside of the
[1:28:56] cup of the platter but within there full
[1:28:58] of extortion
[1:28:59] and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse
[1:29:02] first that which is within the cup
[1:29:04] and platter that the outside of them may
[1:29:07] be clean also
[1:29:09] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:29:10] hypocrites for your likened to white
[1:29:12] sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful
[1:29:14] outward but are within
[1:29:16] full of dead men's bones and of all
[1:29:19] uncleanness
[1:29:21] even so you also outwardly appear
[1:29:22] righteous unto men but within are full
[1:29:25] of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:29:27] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:29:28] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[1:29:30] of the prophets and garnish the
[1:29:32] sepulchers of the righteous
[1:29:33] and you say if we had been in the days
[1:29:36] of our fathers we would not have been
[1:29:37] partakers with them in the blood of the
[1:29:39] prophets
[1:29:40] wherefore you be witness unto yourselves
[1:29:42] that you are the children of them which
[1:29:44] killed the prophets
[1:29:46] which are not the children of abraham
[1:29:48] that's what he's pointing out
[1:29:51] fill you up than the measure of your
[1:29:52] fathers ye serpents you generation of
[1:29:55] vipers
[1:29:55] how can you escape the damnation of hell
[1:30:00] now that is a shocking that is a
[1:30:02] shocking
[1:30:03] uh a bit of monologue
[1:30:07] he just comes and he lays it down lays
[1:30:09] it down lays it down lays it down
[1:30:10] but you have to in that day if you if we
[1:30:13] could transport ourselves back to the
[1:30:15] day that he was saying this
[1:30:16] and the group of the people that he was
[1:30:17] talking to he was talking to the most
[1:30:20] religious the most holy the most
[1:30:21] sanctified
[1:30:22] the most set aside group of all the
[1:30:24] believers into jews
[1:30:27] he was speaking to the cream of the crop
[1:30:30] he was speaking to the best of the best
[1:30:35] and it was a shocking statement can you
[1:30:37] imagine the little
[1:30:38] prostitute is sitting there hearing what
[1:30:40] he's saying amen
[1:30:42] she could believe in her own heart well
[1:30:43] if that pharisee can't make it there's
[1:30:45] no hope for me
[1:30:47] because to her he was
[1:30:50] perfect in the eyes of other people
[1:30:54] they were the religious ones they were
[1:30:56] the spiritual ones
[1:30:57] they were the godly ones and jesus
[1:30:59] christ come and poked a hole all the way
[1:31:01] through that and his voice was exposing
[1:31:03] the fig leaves and he was leaving them
[1:31:05] naked totally exposed
[1:31:08] for the liars and hypocrites that they
[1:31:10] were they were supporting a system
[1:31:12] of their own making that they had built
[1:31:14] over generations amen
[1:31:15] and they were no longer trusting in god
[1:31:17] they were trusting in their system they
[1:31:19] were no longer worshiping god they were
[1:31:20] worshiping the system
[1:31:23] and when they were proselytizing and
[1:31:25] making converse they were making
[1:31:26] converts
[1:31:27] not to god or to his word they were
[1:31:29] making converts to their system
[1:31:32] and that's why brother branham said the
[1:31:34] baptist will bring forth a baptist the
[1:31:36] pentecostal will bring forth a
[1:31:37] pentecostal but the bride has got to
[1:31:39] bring forth a child of the word amen
[1:31:41] she cannot bring forth of her own mind
[1:31:43] her own system her understanding
[1:31:45] this bride's been impregnated she's to
[1:31:47] bring forth but she cannot bring forth
[1:31:49] another baptism another pentecost
[1:31:51] another system of thinking at all
[1:31:53] i don't care what you call it what name
[1:31:55] you put on it if it comes forth out of
[1:31:57] the system
[1:31:58] it's hybrid but the only thing
[1:32:01] she can bring forth is a child of the
[1:32:04] word
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:06] that's why the word has been restored in
[1:32:08] our day
[1:32:13] but don't think that the devil's not
[1:32:15] still trying to creep around
[1:32:19] and bring nimrod's tactics right among
[1:32:21] us
[1:32:25] we have seen disaster after disaster at
[1:32:27] the disaster
[1:32:31] because
[1:32:35] we've tried to convert people
[1:32:40] by governments
[1:32:43] we tried to bring a conquest
[1:32:46] by conquering their intellectual
[1:32:48] understanding of the bible and doctrine
[1:32:54] i may have been the only one who's ever
[1:32:55] seen that
[1:32:58] but it's still the truth
[1:33:03] you'll see an attempt to bring
[1:33:04] conversion by conquest
[1:33:07] and what do you mean by conversion by
[1:33:09] conquest
[1:33:11] if i can through debate and reasoning
[1:33:14] and wisdom
[1:33:15] convince you that the doctrines of the
[1:33:18] message are right
[1:33:20] but with no real revelation from god
[1:33:23] just a mental
[1:33:24] agreement and a
[1:33:27] conceptual understanding that yeah i see
[1:33:29] the bible it looks like all that fits
[1:33:30] together yeah you must be right
[1:33:33] i have by conquest conquered your
[1:33:36] intellect
[1:33:39] and i have made a convert by conquest
[1:33:44] now that convert because he was
[1:33:47] converted by conquest or she
[1:33:50] they will be converted by the next
[1:33:52] stronger army that shows up
[1:33:56] so when they find discrepancies in the
[1:33:58] message and and people who
[1:34:00] who fell away and all of these evidences
[1:34:03] now all of a sudden your strength is not
[1:34:06] as strong as
[1:34:09] so you'll lose your subject who you
[1:34:13] conquered
[1:34:14] to a stronger army with better weapons
[1:34:19] better weapons of reasoning intellect
[1:34:22] and wisdom
[1:34:24] this is not god's method
[1:34:27] for making converts to christ
[1:34:31] then there are times when brother venom
[1:34:32] speaks about this i don't have to quote
[1:34:33] with me but
[1:34:34] he talks about a couple places there are
[1:34:36] times
[1:34:37] that if i come to you and i begin to
[1:34:40] conquer your emotions
[1:34:45] this is a dangerous one brother bram
[1:34:48] said
[1:34:48] he goes i don't like those altar calls
[1:34:50] where they get them and say now you
[1:34:51] remember john your mom you know she's in
[1:34:53] heaven now what would she think wouldn't
[1:34:55] she want you to be saved
[1:34:59] what are you doing you're conquering
[1:35:01] them emotionally
[1:35:04] amen bringing fear
[1:35:08] or emotional strings
[1:35:11] or even an emotional enthusiasm it can
[1:35:13] be any way you want
[1:35:14] but now you can begin to conquer
[1:35:17] emotionally
[1:35:20] and we can make converts by emotional
[1:35:24] conquest
[1:35:25] but those converts never stay long
[1:35:27] because emotions are so thick away man
[1:35:30] that they'll they'll come from a camp
[1:35:32] meeting or revival or a great service
[1:35:34] and they will be walking on the clouds
[1:35:36] as high as high can be
[1:35:37] amen and then the next thing you know
[1:35:39] they're in the dumps they don't even
[1:35:40] believe the message they haven't come to
[1:35:42] church for a couple of months amen
[1:35:44] what happened to them they were only
[1:35:45] emotionally conquered amen
[1:35:47] they weren't converted there was no
[1:35:49] conversion it was a conquest
[1:35:51] and the conquest won't hold when
[1:35:53] stronger emotions show up
[1:35:55] they're gone
[1:35:59] so god gave us our boundaries
[1:36:04] and he didn't say go go conquer
[1:36:07] egypt and make them jews they weren't
[1:36:10] allowed to
[1:36:11] they weren't allowed to leave this
[1:36:13] boundary amen and this boundary
[1:36:15] is the word of god and the word of god
[1:36:16] is for you as an individual
[1:36:18] and you are to bring your individual
[1:36:20] life subject to
[1:36:22] every word of god amen and within this
[1:36:25] you're allowed to use
[1:36:26] force devil
[1:36:29] get thee behind me that's a lie that's
[1:36:32] not in the word
[1:36:33] now thou evil thought leave me now i
[1:36:36] command you in the name of jesus christ
[1:36:38] by the authority he gave in the church
[1:36:39] get away from me
[1:36:42] you can by force you're allowed to go
[1:36:44] into your house and you're allowed to
[1:36:45] throw all the garbage out
[1:36:48] but i'm not allowed to go into your
[1:36:50] house
[1:36:54] because i'm only here to bring my own
[1:36:57] land subject to god's word
[1:37:01] so that he can have preeminence so i can
[1:37:04] be the light
[1:37:06] and if the light will shine there'll be
[1:37:08] a drawing power
[1:37:09] he says christ jesus said if i be lifted
[1:37:12] up i will draw
[1:37:13] all men unto me
[1:37:17] but we have tried to conquer
[1:37:20] intellect and we when that didn't work
[1:37:23] we tried to conquer
[1:37:24] emotions
[1:37:29] and many times we've tried to conquer
[1:37:31] somebody's will
[1:37:36] remember it was either the sign in the
[1:37:40] head
[1:37:41] or the sign in the hand
[1:37:45] either you were convinced intellectually
[1:37:48] that it was right and supported it
[1:37:50] or you didn't even go along with it but
[1:37:52] it became so
[1:37:54] personally inconvenient
[1:37:58] it became so personally inconvenient
[1:38:03] that i'm willing to go along with it
[1:38:07] and that is why sometimes you have
[1:38:09] generational believers and families
[1:38:11] and you can see family members don't
[1:38:12] believe it all but they won't leave mom
[1:38:14] and dad they won't leave husband and
[1:38:15] wife
[1:38:16] they won't leave children they won't
[1:38:18] leave this or that they'd stay attached
[1:38:20] to the message
[1:38:20] amen because they don't necessarily
[1:38:22] believe with it but it becomes so
[1:38:24] personally inconvenient
[1:38:28] to walk away with truth cutting off
[1:38:30] relationships amen damaging
[1:38:33] to friendships damaging to relationships
[1:38:36] that all of a sudden
[1:38:37] now we're holding somebody
[1:38:41] because you can fall by a mark in the
[1:38:44] head
[1:38:44] or a mark in the hand
[1:38:47] can hold you to the system
[1:38:52] see when it comes to the system the
[1:38:55] system
[1:38:55] is not based on faith
[1:39:00] because rome didn't care what you
[1:39:01] believe even the catholic church
[1:39:04] amen i i told you before i read an
[1:39:06] article where
[1:39:07] indonesia now the government of
[1:39:09] indonesia several years back
[1:39:10] was going to require in their senses
[1:39:12] that you mark a religion you had to pick
[1:39:14] a couple religions
[1:39:16] but they had aboriginal people that were
[1:39:18] living in the jungles in indonesia
[1:39:20] and they were in ancestor worship and
[1:39:21] there was nothing on the document for
[1:39:23] them to sign
[1:39:26] so they chose christian
[1:39:30] all of these aboriginal people who lived
[1:39:32] in the jungle
[1:39:33] in a primitive way and worshiped their
[1:39:34] ancestors they picked christian
[1:39:36] because the catholic church moved in and
[1:39:38] told them that they could still
[1:39:40] worship their dead ancestors under their
[1:39:42] religion
[1:39:45] because it's not about what you believe
[1:39:48] is that true the catholic church
[1:39:51] didn't care that that pygmy believed
[1:39:53] that he could worship a dead
[1:39:55] father uncle and that those blessings
[1:39:59] coming from that
[1:39:59] he didn't care as long as that pygmy
[1:40:03] participated
[1:40:04] in the system that's all he cared about
[1:40:10] having another member swallowing them
[1:40:13] into the system
[1:40:14] uh brother jean kadema told me that in
[1:40:17] africa they did the exact same thing
[1:40:19] catholic church moved in and swept
[1:40:21] through africa because you could still
[1:40:23] be a christian and still worship
[1:40:25] ancestors
[1:40:28] because the roman system doesn't care
[1:40:30] what you believe
[1:40:33] do you understand this go all the way
[1:40:34] back to the roman system they don't care
[1:40:36] what you believe
[1:40:38] all they care about is participation
[1:40:42] that you participate in the system
[1:40:44] that's why you can have a mark in your
[1:40:45] head
[1:40:46] agreement or you don't even have to
[1:40:48] agree you have a mark in your hand
[1:40:50] you can participate
[1:40:55] so this is the foundation
[1:40:58] of the system you can believe whatever
[1:41:02] you want but as long as you participate
[1:41:04] that's nimrod nimrod never made converts
[1:41:07] to
[1:41:07] his religion he conquered them and made
[1:41:10] participants in his religion
[1:41:14] he made them participate in his religion
[1:41:16] they could disbelieve it all they want
[1:41:18] amen it wasn't about whether they
[1:41:21] believed it or not
[1:41:22] as long as they participated they were
[1:41:24] saved if they didn't participate they
[1:41:26] were dead
[1:41:28] nebuchadnezzar picks up this same spirit
[1:41:31] amen when he brings the jews in he
[1:41:32] doesn't mind that the jews worship
[1:41:34] jehovah
[1:41:37] nebuchadnezzar never tried to stop them
[1:41:39] from worshiping jehovah
[1:41:41] but when he made an image he required
[1:41:43] that all bowed down to this image and
[1:41:45] this is now you can
[1:41:46] keep believing in jehovah he's not
[1:41:47] asking them to drop their jewish faith
[1:41:50] he's asking them to participate in the
[1:41:52] system of religion
[1:41:56] and when they refuse to participate now
[1:41:59] he's got
[1:42:00] to kill them listen we're breaking down
[1:42:03] religion at its core
[1:42:06] the threat to religion is
[1:42:12] non-participation
[1:42:14] because they don't care what you believe
[1:42:17] they care
[1:42:18] if you participate or not do you come to
[1:42:22] church
[1:42:22] do you pay your tithes
[1:42:26] do you dress right talk right walk right
[1:42:27] right
[1:42:29] but what about are you converted
[1:42:35] are you converted have you met jesus
[1:42:37] christ
[1:42:38] have you been conquered or have you been
[1:42:40] drawn
[1:42:45] nimrod didn't care what you believed but
[1:42:48] he forced your participation
[1:42:51] in the world council churches they don't
[1:42:52] care what you believe
[1:42:56] only care about your participation the
[1:42:58] catholic church doesn't care what you
[1:43:00] believe
[1:43:00] they're worried about your participation
[1:43:04] the baptist church does not care what
[1:43:06] you believe
[1:43:09] as long as you participate
[1:43:12] and participation
[1:43:15] brings a unity
[1:43:19] think about this participation brings a
[1:43:21] unity and a unity brings a false sense
[1:43:24] of security
[1:43:27] so now the threat to religion because
[1:43:30] religion is all about
[1:43:32] keeping man from god creating a barrier
[1:43:36] or wall to keep man separated from god
[1:43:38] so now the religion all that they care
[1:43:41] about is participate this is the spirit
[1:43:43] behind i don't care what anybody says or
[1:43:44] what church you go to
[1:43:45] it doesn't matter it'll show up in all
[1:43:47] kinds of forms and rituals and rules and
[1:43:48] conduct an order
[1:43:49] that you can think of a million
[1:43:51] different ways i'm not worried about it
[1:43:52] i'm coming down to the very spirit of it
[1:43:54] at its core
[1:43:55] which we saw in cain we saw nimrod we
[1:43:57] saw nebuchadnezzar we saw in rome
[1:44:01] it comes down to the same thing the
[1:44:03] threat to religion becomes
[1:44:04] non-participation
[1:44:07] because participation brings unity and
[1:44:09] unity brings a false security
[1:44:12] that's the same thing will happen under
[1:44:14] this world council of churches
[1:44:15] amen participation brings a unity unity
[1:44:18] brings a sense of security
[1:44:20] self-preservation self-protection
[1:44:23] and now any voice against
[1:44:27] that becomes a threat
[1:44:31] and now that voice against that one of
[1:44:33] two things have to happen
[1:44:35] they either have to drive them out
[1:44:39] leave us go away from us or kill them
[1:44:43] there's the and i'm talking religion now
[1:44:46] please
[1:44:47] listen spiritual religion you have to
[1:44:50] either drive them out
[1:44:52] or kill them but today they can't take
[1:44:56] you out and shoot you or stone you
[1:44:59] so they kill your influence
[1:45:03] they drive you out amen and they say
[1:45:06] things about you like you're not even a
[1:45:07] message believer
[1:45:09] if you believe that way
[1:45:14] do you see the system
[1:45:17] they have to drive you out
[1:45:20] or kill you that's why nebuchadnezzar
[1:45:24] had a problem when these three
[1:45:25] it's not that nebuchadnezzar was mad at
[1:45:27] these three he loved him he gave him a
[1:45:29] second chance
[1:45:31] they were wise with his kingdom they
[1:45:32] were they were in positions of power and
[1:45:34] authority
[1:45:35] and the court of nebuchadnezer amen it's
[1:45:37] not that he wanted to go darius did not
[1:45:39] want to throw daniel into the lion's den
[1:45:41] but he was trapped in his own system and
[1:45:43] non-participation was the problem
[1:45:47] because darius knew who daniel's god was
[1:45:49] he knew that daniel prayed to that god
[1:45:51] and darius had no problem with it
[1:45:53] amen but they brought darius around amen
[1:45:56] they said let's exalt you in the system
[1:45:58] amen and now with a systematic approach
[1:46:01] amen now
[1:46:02] he made a new law and now the problem
[1:46:04] was not
[1:46:05] that daniel prayed jehovah the problem
[1:46:08] was that
[1:46:08] daniel was not participating because
[1:46:12] darius
[1:46:12] did not care that daniel prayed to
[1:46:14] jehovah
[1:46:17] do you believe that the problem is
[1:46:24] non-participation
[1:46:28] see you can believe what you want
[1:46:31] and you can have no faith and not even
[1:46:34] be converted
[1:46:35] but if you pay your tithe and dress
[1:46:36] right and come every sunday
[1:46:39] then you're all right
[1:46:44] then you're okay now the
[1:46:47] system is protecting you
[1:46:51] from the judgment of the word
[1:46:56] because you do what we fundamentally
[1:46:58] believe in to be true and you
[1:47:00] participate
[1:47:02] now we're going to protect you
[1:47:05] because participation brings unity
[1:47:08] unity brings a false sense of security
[1:47:12] and any voice against it has to be
[1:47:15] excommunicated or killed
[1:47:19] this is the system friends and the
[1:47:22] system is
[1:47:23] all around us trying to get in
[1:47:28] we've brought a systematic approach
[1:47:30] sometimes to saving our children
[1:47:40] we bring our children into the system of
[1:47:44] obeying everything which is what we have
[1:47:46] to do because
[1:47:47] joshua said as for me and my house we
[1:47:49] will serve the lord your children in
[1:47:51] your house
[1:47:52] there's you have to bring that under
[1:47:53] dominion of the word you have no choice
[1:47:57] but if your children aren't converted
[1:47:59] they're not okay
[1:48:03] they can dress the way a believer ought
[1:48:05] to dress
[1:48:06] they can come to church they can raise
[1:48:08] their hands and pray but if they're not
[1:48:10] converted they're not okay
[1:48:12] just because they participate
[1:48:15] don't make participation in a message
[1:48:18] church the same as conversion
[1:48:26] we have people who've lost their
[1:48:28] children to the world and there's all
[1:48:29] kinds of reasons why we lose our
[1:48:31] children to the world
[1:48:34] but they'll come back if they saw a
[1:48:36] light
[1:48:38] because we don't convert by governments
[1:48:41] we convert by christ in you
[1:48:45] they may go and that may be what they
[1:48:48] need to go so that they cannot feel
[1:48:50] comfortable in the system anymore
[1:48:52] but they have to recognize where the
[1:48:53] light and life was so that they can come
[1:48:55] to the light on their own
[1:48:59] children have gone there's many many
[1:49:01] reasons for why they go
[1:49:02] but sometimes we get so confused when we
[1:49:05] say i took them to every camp i could
[1:49:07] get them to we were always in church
[1:49:09] i played the tapes in the house
[1:49:13] and we believe that somehow because we
[1:49:15] got them to participate in all that for
[1:49:17] 18 19 20 years that they were converted
[1:49:19] that's not equal to conversion that's
[1:49:21] participation and participation can
[1:49:23] bring a false sense of security
[1:49:28] so we get surprised when they go away
[1:49:30] but the truth is they weren't converted
[1:49:34] and all the participation in the world
[1:49:37] amen sometimes when we try to get our
[1:49:38] kids converted
[1:49:39] we do extra participation
[1:49:45] is that true it's a denominational
[1:49:48] mentality
[1:49:49] because they're converted by coming
[1:49:50] under the token and the token is the
[1:49:52] life of christ on display in your home
[1:49:57] and sometimes i wonder if we're not
[1:49:59] trying to overcompensate for no christ
[1:50:01] life in the house
[1:50:04] and try because there's no christ light
[1:50:07] in the house
[1:50:08] now we're trying to bring a
[1:50:09] participation and participation will
[1:50:11] become security for our kids
[1:50:16] because it doesn't matter how much you
[1:50:18] participate
[1:50:19] if they see an antichrist spirit at home
[1:50:25] what's an antichrist spirit anti-word i
[1:50:28] thought brother ben said i know but i
[1:50:29] think that's his opinion and we're going
[1:50:31] to do this
[1:50:37] you can get people to participate in the
[1:50:40] system that's not hard
[1:50:44] there's only one way to get somebody
[1:50:45] converted and that's christ in you
[1:50:50] and if you have christ in you then
[1:50:52] brother benham said have confidence in
[1:50:54] your token
[1:50:55] that you can apply the token and that
[1:50:57] token will take effect
[1:51:00] not extra participation but token life
[1:51:03] on display
[1:51:04] will bring the conversion not additional
[1:51:06] participation
[1:51:08] you don't get bonus points there's not
[1:51:10] extra exposure
[1:51:13] do you understand we almost act like
[1:51:16] it's like getting chicken pox the more
[1:51:18] we get together more we get together
[1:51:19] more get together the more chance you
[1:51:20] have of catching it
[1:51:25] i hope you understand my heart i'm not
[1:51:28] trying to discourage
[1:51:29] one person i'm trying to bring it back
[1:51:31] to the word amen
[1:51:32] and your our children everybody around
[1:51:36] us
[1:51:36] has to see the literal life of jesus
[1:51:39] christ in display
[1:51:40] that our territory our land has been
[1:51:42] brought subject to the word
[1:51:44] and from that there's a light that's
[1:51:45] shining so that our children are not
[1:51:47] conquered by the system
[1:51:49] but they're drawn by the life they are
[1:51:52] drawn to the light
[1:51:53] and that light in life is your token and
[1:51:55] that's the thing
[1:51:56] that you put on display but that's also
[1:51:58] the thing you have in
[1:51:59] confidence amen when you're praying for
[1:52:01] your children you say lord i
[1:52:03] know that that token was on display i
[1:52:05] know your life is in me
[1:52:06] it's not that we lived perfect we didn't
[1:52:08] live perfect but god i know that you're
[1:52:10] in me
[1:52:10] and i've got confidence that that token
[1:52:12] will have an effect on my children
[1:52:15] may look bad it may be sideways upside
[1:52:17] down and backwards
[1:52:18] it doesn't matter amen amen if they've
[1:52:20] ever seen the life amen they can never
[1:52:22] forget where that light is
[1:52:24] and the elect are attracted to the light
[1:52:30] brother chad you're against
[1:52:30] participation oh my goodness
[1:52:34] i'm preaching on a sunday morning am i
[1:52:36] against participation
[1:52:42] but it's a product an outcropping of
[1:52:45] faith
[1:52:47] it's not a security that's based on
[1:52:50] participation
[1:52:51] it's a security based on revelation
[1:52:55] and the revelation produces an
[1:52:58] outcropping
[1:52:59] of participation it's a razor's edge
[1:53:08] should we never get together should we
[1:53:09] stop doing news meetings
[1:53:14] you understand the real issue
[1:53:18] that we face is the devil will try to
[1:53:21] bring the message into another system
[1:53:26] another form of group participation that
[1:53:29] brings a unity that brings a false
[1:53:30] security
[1:53:33] where will he try to do it he'll try to
[1:53:34] do it right here
[1:53:37] he'll try to do it in this church he'll
[1:53:39] try to do it in your house
[1:53:41] he'll try to do it in your mind
[1:53:45] there's no point looking anywhere else
[1:53:48] the problems all around us
[1:53:50] what are we fighting against we're
[1:53:52] fighting against systematic religion
[1:53:56] spirits that are trying to get the bride
[1:53:59] off course
[1:54:02] but god has sent a word this day to take
[1:54:04] the veil off of that thing
[1:54:07] and say that's wrong
[1:54:11] we don't make converts by this that or
[1:54:13] the other we make
[1:54:14] converts by christ in you
[1:54:17] what god did in christ christ does in
[1:54:19] you that's it
[1:54:21] right there it's the life
[1:54:24] if you've got somebody in your heart you
[1:54:26] want to get converted keep
[1:54:27] living the life
[1:54:31] we've had people on our minds that we
[1:54:33] try to get converted i've done this
[1:54:34] before i can speak from experience
[1:54:38] somebody i'm burdened for just really
[1:54:39] had a burden for and i really wanted to
[1:54:41] get them converted
[1:54:42] so what i did was had a bible study
[1:54:48] and what my bible study really was was
[1:54:51] not
[1:54:52] an exalting of the word it was a
[1:54:55] conquering by doctrine
[1:54:59] so i'm not talking about anybody else
[1:55:01] i'm talking about me
[1:55:03] you can have a bible study that's
[1:55:04] absolutely correct because it's exalting
[1:55:06] the word
[1:55:07] and every the elect is attracted to the
[1:55:09] light of the age
[1:55:12] or we can sit down and under debate and
[1:55:14] intellectualism i can try to conquer
[1:55:16] your doctrine
[1:55:19] and you know what those two
[1:55:20] conversations can sound exactly the same
[1:55:22] it's the motive behind it that's the
[1:55:24] problem
[1:55:27] it's not the action it's the motive
[1:55:33] it's the spirit that motivates it's what
[1:55:35] we're trying to do
[1:55:39] if israel would just have fully
[1:55:42] surrendered and drove out
[1:55:44] all the inhabitants of the land
[1:55:47] if they would have just pushed out all
[1:55:49] the unbelief
[1:55:51] and allowed their god to be their king
[1:55:55] and bring all the territory subject to
[1:55:57] the word of god
[1:55:59] the people in the nations would have
[1:56:00] been attracted by droves would be coming
[1:56:02] to find out what was going on there
[1:56:05] what they should have done is bring
[1:56:07] their territory subject not try to
[1:56:09] conquer somebody else
[1:56:11] or not try to settle down and just have
[1:56:14] peace and stop driving out enemies
[1:56:16] they failed by them
[1:56:25] john 3 19 says and this is the
[1:56:28] condemnation that light has come into
[1:56:29] the world and men loved darkness rather
[1:56:31] than light
[1:56:32] because their deeds were evil for
[1:56:34] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:56:35] light
[1:56:36] neither cometh to the light lest his
[1:56:38] deeds should be
[1:56:40] reproved that's why we have to shine a
[1:56:43] light
[1:56:46] the light exposes the deeds of darkness
[1:56:51] but man wants to be religious and he
[1:56:53] wants to be a christian he wants to be a
[1:56:55] believer
[1:56:56] so he'll find a system
[1:57:03] i want to look at one more story and
[1:57:06] then we'll wind down and close let's go
[1:57:08] to first kings i just want to show a
[1:57:10] demonstration of what i'm
[1:57:12] trying to express
[1:57:26] first kings chapter 10.
[1:57:32] first kings chapter 10 and verse 1.
[1:57:37] and when the queen of sheba heard of the
[1:57:39] fame of solomon concerning the name of
[1:57:41] the lord
[1:57:42] she came to prove him with hard
[1:57:43] questions
[1:57:48] brother branham calls the reign of
[1:57:49] solomon in the beginning of his reign
[1:57:51] the golden age of israel
[1:57:54] they had secured borders they had
[1:57:57] chopped down the groves they
[1:57:58] they had run everything out and brought
[1:58:00] everything into subjection they had
[1:58:01] built
[1:58:02] under solomon they had built the temple
[1:58:04] amen they have the priesthood
[1:58:05] established the temple worship
[1:58:06] established
[1:58:07] they've come into their golden age
[1:58:10] they're shining light
[1:58:14] and when the queen of sheba heard of the
[1:58:16] famous solomon concerning the name of
[1:58:18] the lord
[1:58:20] she came to prove him with hard
[1:58:21] questions and she came to jerusalem with
[1:58:23] a very great train with camels
[1:58:25] that bear spices and very much gold and
[1:58:28] precious stones and when she was
[1:58:29] come to solomon she communed with him of
[1:58:32] all that was in her heart
[1:58:34] and solomon told her all her questions
[1:58:36] there was not anything hid from the king
[1:58:38] which he told or not
[1:58:39] and when the queen of sheba had seen all
[1:58:41] solomon's wisdom in the house that he
[1:58:43] had built
[1:58:44] and the meat of his table and the
[1:58:46] sitting of his servants and the
[1:58:48] attendants of his men
[1:58:49] what he done he had brought everything
[1:58:51] under subjection
[1:58:55] in the attendance at his tables of his
[1:58:57] ministers and their apparel
[1:58:59] and the cup holders and his ascent by
[1:59:01] which he went up into the house of the
[1:59:03] lord
[1:59:03] his approach to god there was no more
[1:59:07] spirit in her and she said to the king
[1:59:09] it was true report that i heard in my
[1:59:11] own land of thy acts and in my wisdom
[1:59:14] how being
[1:59:14] i believe not the words until i came and
[1:59:17] mine eyes had seen it
[1:59:18] and behold the half was not told me thy
[1:59:21] wisdom
[1:59:21] and prosperity exceedeth the fame which
[1:59:24] i heard
[1:59:25] happy are thy men happy are those that
[1:59:28] thy servants which stand continually
[1:59:29] before thee
[1:59:30] and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the
[1:59:33] lord thy god which delighteth in thee
[1:59:35] to set thee on the throne of israel
[1:59:36] because the lord hath loved israel
[1:59:38] forever
[1:59:39] therefore made he the king to do
[1:59:42] judgment
[1:59:43] and justice she traveled
[1:59:47] a long ways
[1:59:51] solomon never went down into southern
[1:59:53] arabia and
[1:59:54] conquered that nation
[1:59:58] to make the queen of sheba a convert
[2:00:02] solomon actually never conquered
[2:00:05] amen to bring proselytes into israel
[2:00:11] he drove out every force and demolished
[2:00:13] every threat against
[2:00:15] israel and brought israel into the
[2:00:18] worship of jehovah
[2:00:19] and that was their golden age and under
[2:00:21] the golden age amen
[2:00:22] from far away
[2:00:26] without him going to convince
[2:00:29] to conquer to play emotional games
[2:00:35] all solomon did was keep subjecting to
[2:00:37] the word of god to the word of god to
[2:00:38] the word of god to the word of god
[2:00:40] and his fame was going out he was
[2:00:43] shining a light
[2:00:45] and this queen of sheba from far away
[2:00:46] which they believe is down near yemen
[2:00:48] somewhere
[2:00:50] queen of sheba traveled all this way
[2:00:51] across the desert to hear
[2:00:53] and when she saw when she heard the
[2:00:56] words and she saw the wisdom
[2:00:57] and she saw the order that everything
[2:00:59] was in there was no more heart left in
[2:01:01] her
[2:01:02] she knew that this was true because we
[2:01:05] don't make converts
[2:01:07] by governments we make converts by
[2:01:09] christ in you
[2:01:12] what can i do to win my children christ
[2:01:14] in you
[2:01:16] what can i do to win my family members
[2:01:18] christ in you what can i do
[2:01:20] what can i do to win my my neighbors or
[2:01:22] my co-workers
[2:01:23] christ in you you don't make converts by
[2:01:25] governments you don't go out and conquer
[2:01:27] them
[2:01:28] amen you conquer self amen you put
[2:01:30] self-will down
[2:01:32] you conquer your own reasonings your own
[2:01:34] wisdom your own end to life
[2:01:36] conquer this territory and drive out all
[2:01:38] unbelief
[2:01:41] how's that going to save my children
[2:01:44] because when christ is on display and
[2:01:45] the tokens on display
[2:01:47] then you can have confidence in that
[2:01:49] token to take effect
[2:01:51] for your children not your works
[2:01:54] not your efforts not
[2:01:57] the token brotherhood and say apply the
[2:02:01] token and then sit them down and have a
[2:02:03] good long talk with them and make them
[2:02:04] see that this is true
[2:02:06] and lock the door and don't even let
[2:02:08] them go out
[2:02:11] you apply the token with confidence that
[2:02:13] will take effect and the next time you
[2:02:14] go to talk to them say lord
[2:02:15] help me i'm going to talk to my son let
[2:02:17] me get them i claim them in jesus name
[2:02:20] let the token life take effect
[2:02:27] if you're attracting if the goal
[2:02:30] of a religious system is to attract
[2:02:35] more numbers you don't care if you get
[2:02:37] goat or sheep
[2:02:41] because all you want to do is fill the
[2:02:42] seeds
[2:02:44] so you don't really care what they
[2:02:45] believe or who they are if they're
[2:02:47] converted
[2:02:47] the only thing that you require to fill
[2:02:49] your seats is that they participate in
[2:02:51] your system
[2:02:53] and i don't care what religious system
[2:02:55] it is you attach any name you want to it
[2:02:57] it plays by the same rules a liberal
[2:03:00] church a legalist church
[2:03:02] all churches in between they all play by
[2:03:04] the same rules
[2:03:05] because it's a religious spirit that
[2:03:07] they're all motivated by
[2:03:09] if you just want to fill seats then you
[2:03:11] don't it doesn't matter conversions are
[2:03:13] not the problem
[2:03:14] amen conquering to your system you want
[2:03:17] to convert
[2:03:18] not to christ but convert to the system
[2:03:24] so when you convert to the system now
[2:03:27] you can
[2:03:28] get anything but if you're not trying to
[2:03:32] fill
[2:03:32] one seat if you don't care
[2:03:36] whether one more goes in or one leaves
[2:03:39] or whatever
[2:03:40] as long as christ is exalted
[2:03:44] as long as the light is shining as long
[2:03:46] as the true word
[2:03:48] is being lifted up amen you know beyond
[2:03:51] a shadow of a doubt that my
[2:03:52] sheep hear my voice another than not
[2:03:54] follow if it's the voice of the
[2:03:56] of the shepherd the sheep will come
[2:03:59] we're not interested in attracting
[2:04:01] people we're not interested in making
[2:04:02] converts we're not interested in
[2:04:04] conquering
[2:04:05] anything except us
[2:04:11] he says when i be lifted up jesus when
[2:04:13] he was here he says
[2:04:14] i am the light of the world
[2:04:18] he looked at his disciples before he
[2:04:19] departed and says ye
[2:04:21] are the light of the world
[2:04:26] just shine the light we're not here
[2:04:31] to make converts by conquest
[2:04:37] but by christ in you
[2:04:41] god has never violated
[2:04:44] free moral agency
[2:04:48] he's got ways of making free more
[2:04:50] latency work out
[2:04:55] but god put man on the basis of free
[2:04:57] choice and he didn't put the church here
[2:04:59] to overcome and conquer that
[2:05:03] he just said shine the light lift
[2:05:06] up christ if i be lifted up
[2:05:09] all men will come
[2:05:13] he says it's got to come down to
[2:05:16] the line of free moral agency yourself
[2:05:19] let the word of god you don't come
[2:05:21] because your mother was a good woman you
[2:05:22] don't come because you're a good
[2:05:23] neighbor
[2:05:24] you come because that god calls you to
[2:05:26] come
[2:05:27] and you accept him on the basis of his
[2:05:29] word that word is what means
[2:05:31] everything that word if you can get
[2:05:33] everything out of the way all conscience
[2:05:35] all senses and just let the word come in
[2:05:37] that word will produce just exactly
[2:05:41] in revelation chapter 4 he says how did
[2:05:44] it self-will
[2:05:45] why would you call that self-will
[2:05:47] brother branham because it puts a man
[2:05:49] and a woman
[2:05:50] back again just like adam and eve at the
[2:05:52] garden of eden
[2:05:53] on what the two trees self-will this one
[2:05:56] is death this one is life
[2:05:57] self-will free moral agency god placed
[2:06:00] the first man adam and eve
[2:06:02] right here on free moral agency he
[2:06:04] places you the same place
[2:06:06] and the only way that you can get this
[2:06:07] thing fixed in there is your self-will
[2:06:10] your own self-will hallelujah your
[2:06:12] self-will you have to will
[2:06:14] to do god's will you have to get rid of
[2:06:17] your own will to let god's will come in
[2:06:20] for this is the only channel that leads
[2:06:22] to the heart
[2:06:24] by your own self-will
[2:06:28] you lay down your life i want to read
[2:06:31] two passages of scriptures and we'll
[2:06:32] close
[2:06:33] first peter turn to first peter chapter
[2:06:37] two
[2:06:39] oh my there's so much
[2:06:43] first peter chapter 2.
[2:06:55] first peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[2:07:00] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[2:07:04] priesthood
[2:07:05] a holy nation a peculiar people
[2:07:09] that you should show forth the praises
[2:07:11] of him who hath called you
[2:07:13] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[2:07:16] which in time past we're not a people
[2:07:19] but are now the people of god
[2:07:20] this is exactly how he spoke to israel
[2:07:23] when he brought them out of egypt
[2:07:25] this is now the bride which in time past
[2:07:29] were not of people but are now the
[2:07:30] people of god which had not obtained
[2:07:32] mercy but have now obtained mercy
[2:07:34] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[2:07:36] strangers and pilgrims abstained from
[2:07:38] fleshly lust which
[2:07:39] war against the soul have your
[2:07:41] conversation honest among the gentiles
[2:07:43] that whereas they speak against you as
[2:07:45] evil doers they may be
[2:07:46] they may by your good works which they
[2:07:48] shall behold glorify god
[2:07:51] in the day of visitation turn over to
[2:07:54] isaiah 60.
[2:08:00] isaiah 60 and verse 1.
[2:08:07] we're speaking here of the bride in the
[2:08:08] end time
[2:08:11] it says arise shine
[2:08:15] for thy light has come that's our
[2:08:17] commandment
[2:08:18] arise and shine the sun is up this is a
[2:08:22] commandment arise
[2:08:24] and shine for thy light has come and the
[2:08:27] glory of the lord is risen upon thee
[2:08:29] that is what's happened to the bride in
[2:08:31] this end time
[2:08:33] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[2:08:35] earth in gross darkness to people is
[2:08:37] that true
[2:08:38] is that this day but the lord shall
[2:08:40] arise
[2:08:42] upon thee and his glory
[2:08:45] shall be seen upon thee
[2:08:48] and the gentiles shall come to thy light
[2:08:52] you don't have to conquer anything
[2:08:57] the gentiles shall come to thy light
[2:09:00] and the kings to the brightness of thy
[2:09:03] rising
[2:09:05] lift up thine eyes round about and see
[2:09:08] all the
[2:09:08] they gather themselves together they
[2:09:10] come to thee the sun
[2:09:11] shall come from afar thy daughter shall
[2:09:13] be nursed at thy side
[2:09:15] then thou shalt see and flow together
[2:09:17] and thine heart shall fear and be
[2:09:18] enlarged
[2:09:19] because the abundance of the sea shall
[2:09:20] be converted unto thee
[2:09:22] the forces of the gentiles shall come
[2:09:25] unto thee
[2:09:27] the multitude of camels shall cover thee
[2:09:29] the dromedaries of the midian and
[2:09:31] ephah all the from sheba shall come they
[2:09:34] shall bring gold and
[2:09:35] incense and they shall show forth the
[2:09:37] praises of the lord
[2:09:39] all the flocks of keto shall be gathered
[2:09:41] together
[2:09:44] all the flocks of keto shall be gathered
[2:09:46] together
[2:09:47] and the rams of naropath shall minister
[2:09:49] unto thee they shall come up
[2:09:51] with acceptance on mine altar and i will
[2:09:53] glorify
[2:09:55] the house i shall glorify thy house of
[2:09:58] my the house of my glory
[2:09:59] who are these that fly as a cloud and as
[2:10:01] the doves to their window surely the
[2:10:03] isle shall wait for me
[2:10:04] and the ships of tarshish first to bring
[2:10:07] thy sons from afar their silver their
[2:10:09] gold with them unto the name of the lord
[2:10:11] thy god
[2:10:12] and to the holy one of israel because he
[2:10:14] hath glorified thee
[2:10:15] and the sons of strangers shall build up
[2:10:17] the walls and their
[2:10:18] kings shall minister unto thee for in my
[2:10:21] wrath i smote thee but in my favor have
[2:10:23] i had mercy on thee
[2:10:24] therefore thy gate shall be opened
[2:10:26] continually they shall not be
[2:10:28] shut day nor night that men may bring
[2:10:30] unto thee the forces of the gentiles and
[2:10:32] that their kings may be brought
[2:10:34] for the nation and thy kingdom that will
[2:10:36] not serve thee shall perish
[2:10:38] yea those nations shall be utterly waste
[2:10:40] the glory of lebanon
[2:10:42] shall come unto thee the fur tree the
[2:10:43] pine tree the box together to beautify
[2:10:46] the place of my sanctuary and i will
[2:10:48] make the place of my feet glorious
[2:10:51] the sons also of them that that
[2:10:54] afflicted thee
[2:10:54] shall come bending unto thee and all
[2:10:57] they that despise thee shall bow
[2:10:58] themselves down at the souls of thy feet
[2:11:00] and they shall call thee the city of the
[2:11:03] lord
[2:11:04] the zion of the holy one of israel
[2:11:08] when you read that we know prophecy has
[2:11:11] a dual meaning a natural meaning to
[2:11:13] israel
[2:11:13] but a spiritual meaning to the bride and
[2:11:16] many much of that language also ties
[2:11:18] into new jerusalem
[2:11:21] the heavenly city which is mount zion
[2:11:23] the holy one which is the bride
[2:11:26] and god in this day in a day of gross
[2:11:28] darkness he says arise
[2:11:30] and shine arise and shine
[2:11:34] for your light has come the glory of the
[2:11:37] lord shall be found upon thee
[2:11:38] the glory lord shall shine upon thee and
[2:11:40] what shall he do
[2:11:42] he shall gather all things together
[2:11:45] because in the end time amen there's
[2:11:47] going to be
[2:11:48] a new jerusalem that comes down and
[2:11:50] everything shall come into
[2:11:52] that city and the door shall never be
[2:11:53] closed at night and now there is a
[2:11:55] drawing
[2:11:56] power to wherever christ is wherever
[2:11:59] that light is it emanates out of that
[2:12:01] city
[2:12:03] and christ is the temple thereof the
[2:12:05] lamb is the templar of the
[2:12:06] the light of the lord is shining through
[2:12:09] this
[2:12:10] city and out of this city it's drawing
[2:12:13] all men into the city
[2:12:18] and god we are the dwelling place the
[2:12:20] habitation the temple of the lord
[2:12:24] and god wanted to establish an israel
[2:12:27] a place in jerusalem a place where now
[2:12:30] in the millennium he's going to set
[2:12:31] jesus christ
[2:12:32] on the throne and when jesus christ is
[2:12:34] on the throne there will be a light that
[2:12:36] emanates over the whole earth under his
[2:12:39] kingdom
[2:12:39] and there will be a drawing power from
[2:12:41] that light that will draw
[2:12:44] to jerusalem and in this day
[2:12:48] there's been a great light
[2:12:52] there's been the life of jesus christ
[2:12:55] returning back to the church
[2:12:59] and now in his holy abode in the temple
[2:13:03] in the habitation your lively stones
[2:13:06] built into a spiritual house
[2:13:09] in this new jerusalem now he's shining
[2:13:11] out
[2:13:13] and the light is the attraction
[2:13:17] the life is the attraction the light of
[2:13:20] the word the life of the word
[2:13:22] jesus christ himself on display
[2:13:25] in a mini-men and bobber many many
[2:13:27] member body
[2:13:30] is now the attraction to jesus christ
[2:13:35] we are not to make converts
[2:13:39] like nimrod
[2:13:42] we are to take what jesus said if i be
[2:13:44] lifted up
[2:13:46] i will draw all men unto me
[2:13:50] this is not a religion it's a life
[2:13:55] this is not a system it's a true worship
[2:13:59] it's not a form although there's form
[2:14:02] brother man taught us form to our
[2:14:04] services
[2:14:04] he dot us conduct and order but it's not
[2:14:07] that that's not the thing
[2:14:09] those are outcroppings of our faith all
[2:14:12] of that never will produce faith those
[2:14:13] are outcroppings of faith
[2:14:15] but it's not a form it's not a church
[2:14:17] it's not an altar it's not a sincerity
[2:14:19] sincerity it's the revelation of the
[2:14:21] word
[2:14:22] and it's the life of that word on
[2:14:24] display that's
[2:14:26] drawing all men
[2:14:31] i i pray that you understand my heart
[2:14:35] and the things i say
[2:14:36] i'm not against anybody these things
[2:14:38] corrected me
[2:14:41] i've tried to convert
[2:14:44] by force i've tried
[2:14:48] to convince my intellect especially when
[2:14:51] i first come to the message i had some
[2:14:54] knock down drag out
[2:14:57] arguments over the word
[2:15:01] and my approach was not
[2:15:04] shining the light of christ
[2:15:09] but god wants not your intellect not
[2:15:12] your wisdom
[2:15:12] but your surrender
[2:15:16] nimrod had the power the physical force
[2:15:19] and power
[2:15:20] to unify the world and bring them all to
[2:15:22] one religion
[2:15:24] is that true and if god wanted that
[2:15:28] he would have anointed nimrod and he
[2:15:30] would have worked through nimrod
[2:15:32] but what did god do he went and got one
[2:15:34] man that come out of that system and he
[2:15:36] got abraham he pulled him off to the
[2:15:37] side guys separated from everything else
[2:15:40] he said now i give you the land and now
[2:15:42] he was shining his light through abraham
[2:15:45] and guess what abraham had an allegiance
[2:15:48] with some friends
[2:15:49] and he had trained soldiers who could
[2:15:51] fight and destroy
[2:15:52] five kings is that true
[2:15:56] but abraham used that force to deliver
[2:15:58] lot in sodom and the cities that around
[2:16:00] the bound but he never used that force
[2:16:02] to produce the promise of the word
[2:16:06] because god wasn't looking for abraham's
[2:16:08] strength he was looking for abraham's
[2:16:09] surrender
[2:16:13] when god come to drive the inhabitants
[2:16:14] off the land and
[2:16:16] set up his his nation in the set up
[2:16:19] his uh nation upon the earth and israel
[2:16:22] he didn't go get
[2:16:24] the amorites he didn't go get uh
[2:16:27] another kingdom the egyptians or some
[2:16:29] other strong army what he got is he
[2:16:31] pulled a bunch of slaves out of egypt
[2:16:34] because he didn't want anything to be
[2:16:36] conquered by strength he didn't want
[2:16:38] anything to be overcome by power or
[2:16:40] force
[2:16:40] so he took something that had no power
[2:16:42] no force and he drew it out and he
[2:16:44] raised it up
[2:16:45] and he sent it in and that's why he said
[2:16:47] i'll drive out the inhabitants they
[2:16:48] weren't even soldiers
[2:16:51] they were slaves because god does not
[2:16:53] want us by strength
[2:16:55] intellect wisdom ability to expand his
[2:16:58] kingdom
[2:17:00] he wants us to come by humility and
[2:17:02] surrender
[2:17:03] and by humility and surrender and
[2:17:05] abasing ourselves
[2:17:07] he will exalt us and when he lifts us up
[2:17:11] he lifts us up by the word
[2:17:12] and now it becomes the word on display
[2:17:15] and
[2:17:15] god wanted to attract by the light of
[2:17:18] the word
[2:17:21] and so now the greatest thing that we
[2:17:23] can do for the lost world around us
[2:17:25] is make a full surrender to god
[2:17:29] to give ourselves holy to this word and
[2:17:31] let by preeminence him come
[2:17:34] and live in us that's the only way
[2:17:38] to convert the world around us is by
[2:17:41] christ
[2:17:42] in you the hope of glory
[2:17:45] let's all stand musicians if you'll come
[2:17:49] i appreciate you being patient with me
[2:17:52] and loving me as i unburden my heart
[2:17:58] you know the gospel is simple
[2:18:04] sometimes we make it so hard the gospel
[2:18:07] is simple
[2:18:09] he's coming for you he's got lost sheep
[2:18:13] and he's coming for you
[2:18:14] and how does he call the sheep by his
[2:18:16] voice
[2:18:18] because my sheep hear my voice they see
[2:18:20] the light they hear the voice
[2:18:22] they come to it that's the gospel that's
[2:18:25] conversion
[2:18:26] that's calling the elect we don't need a
[2:18:29] formal this we don't need a system we
[2:18:32] don't need to convert by force
[2:18:34] all we got to do is keep lifting christ
[2:18:36] on high keep letting the voice of the
[2:18:38] shepherd go out
[2:18:39] keep letting the light shine and the
[2:18:41] elect will come
[2:18:42] the sheep will come the elect will come
[2:18:45] we don't have to worry about it we don't
[2:18:48] want to get sucked in
[2:18:49] to wrong methods and false methods that
[2:18:52] don't produce
[2:18:53] the life there's one thing that produces
[2:18:56] the life
[2:18:57] and that's the life the life
[2:19:00] produces the life and the bride is only
[2:19:04] to bring
[2:19:04] forth children of the word word children
[2:19:09] men let's bow our heads and pray

[2:20:14] the word may they be converted
[2:20:17] and they'd be filled with your spirit
[2:20:20] and they'd be sheep drawn to your fold
[2:20:24] god there's nothing we can do in
[2:20:25] ourselves all we do is surrender
[2:20:28] we don't have the strength or the
[2:20:30] ability
[2:20:31] but we do have a calling we are elect
[2:20:35] and we know it lord for you've called us
[2:20:37] and we have a yielding lord a surrender
[2:20:39] to you and we're asking lord as we
