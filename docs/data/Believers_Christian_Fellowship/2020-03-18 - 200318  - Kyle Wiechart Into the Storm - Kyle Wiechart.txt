========================================

so if we go to psalms 91 and we'll begin at verse 1. he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thy with thine eye shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil be fail thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling amen make that take that word into our hearts and say god you know you've promised to take care of me and i'm trusting you to do what you said you would you bought me with your blood you purchased me you redeemed me back and you've taken full responsibility as my head and i'm trusting in that the the government is upon his shoulders so we just trust him to take care but just in a uh just going a little further from sunday i just wanted to also think about i've been thinking about this and meditating on this as well i was talking to another brother the other day and and we were talking about some of these things but for us as the believers as the bride of jesus christ we've got peace in our hearts we we we're under the wings of jehovah we're covered in feathers you know i love that word picture the bible paints here that he he shall cover thee in verse four with feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth his truth shall be thy shield and buckler so we've got the truth we've got the word we've got the presence of the lord and there's such a peace inside and such a joy even in the midst of all kinds of trouble but the reality is that's just our portion outside the bride people are afraid they're very afraid they're terrified they're gripped by fear there's a spirit of fear that's moving about and gripping the heart to the people and and for me i want to take note of that and recognize that it's time for us to have compassion there's gross darkness upon the people and it's time to have compassion and and not in any ways come across an arrogant as though you know just because we're under the wings of jehovah that we can have an arrogant attitude about that like nobody else should be scared they very well may should be scared you see so so we don't want to condemn or criticize somebody in the world who's afraid but we want to have compassion and a heart of love and say you know the reason i feel the way i do is because what god's done for me because of the connection that i have with his indwelling presence in my life there's a peace that surrounds me i know i'm well cared for i know i'm taken care of and i'm on a foundation of his word that will not move and but that's my position but that's not this man next to me position and we're starting to see a drastic uh difference between the believer and the rest of the world people you know who lived a stable life and had some sort of confidence and all of a sudden the confidence around the world is being shaken the confidence all around and and all of a sudden the gap between the believer and the unbeliever is getting wide and and so i just want us to be conscious of that because it also creates opportunities if we can just be humble you know i told the story of the moravians on the ship when when john wesley was crossing over to america and the storm came and those circumstances but he also writes in his diary and other places about that trip that the moravians were a humble people and they were serving the rest of the people all the time they were taking care of the sick on the ship they were serving they were doing menial tasks that nobody else wanted to do and the moravians gladly did it and they did it with joy so they weren't just you know singing all the time they were serving everybody around them and even the people who were terrified they would joy were serving them and so you know we're in a special position and i want to recognize that and and not condemn anybody else but say god if there's any way i can take what's in my heart and put it in their heart i would gladly do it with everything that's in me if i could take the joy in my heart the peace that god's given me the love for god if i could take that and put it in the heart of the people you see with a face and tear eyes and fear i would do it if i could and i'm just praying god give us an opportunity give us an opportunity but but let's walk in in meekness and humility that's what i'm going to say we know that we're under protection but also you know everybody else is afraid and so when we walk into a place if you go into a waiting room for a doctor or if you go into uh anywhere like that they've got the seats you know three feet six feet apart however long far apart they are because that's what they've been recommended to do that's what they're told to do just because we're not we're okay doesn't mean we should go push those seats together and sit down because as soon as you do that you bring fear into the heart of somebody else and that's not even kind you know they're afraid don't scare them just sit six feet apart do your thing and go back we're not afraid it's not that we have a problem but they're afraid and i don't want to make them more afraid i don't want to induce panic by my conduct i went into saint rita's the other day to visit somebody and they had to sign up and they asked everybody to use hand sanitizer when they come in the door so i used hand sanitizer when i come in the door not because i was afraid of germs because the sign says please use hand sanitizer it's just a common courtesy and if somebody would see you walk past that and arrogantly say i don't need that and i'm the bride of jesus christ what would that do in their heart the fear that would come up and all those things we've got to be careful amen that we don't cause an offense for no reason so we just want to be conscious of that and have compassion and understand capstone love is a different kind of love it's a love of understanding based off revelation and we know amen that god is our refuge god is our strength he's our strong power his word will work his promises are true we're in the we're under the blood covenant we know that we're safe and we know that there's healing in the cup but it doesn't mean that that that revelation can be forced on somebody else and it doesn't mean that that puts us in a position where we incite panic and fear in somebody else's heart so we just have to have understanding because capstone the capstone is understanding knowing the difference that's gross darkness satan's eden has brought the people satan as the shepherd of this world has brought the people into destruction the pale horse riding in the fourth seal that anointing breaking out upon the earth is bringing death but praise god the true white horse writer is writing in our hearts christ what a contrast what two different paths we're on amen and we're coming to a time where we're starting to see there's two different paths that we're on and so we want to be conscious of that also let's look together at first peter chapter 3. first peter chapter 3. and verse 15. first peter 3 and 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear i believe we're gonna have more opportunities to exercise this scripture in the next few weeks or months and i have a desire to because if somebody else can receive the hope that i have as far as i know the door to the ark isn't shut and noah never shut it and noah didn't desire to shut it noah was standing in the door until god sent him in saying come come come come come and i want to do the same thing stand in the door and say come come come until god says no more but as far as we know that door is still open and i want somebody to be able to receive what i have so i want somebody to be able to receive peace also in the assembly things are changing we've got a situation over the next few weeks maybe the next couple months where people are going to probably be sent home from work some have already been sent home some may some with pay maybe some without pay and so we want to watch one another and bind ourselves closer together and be conscious of where your brother's at and if you can help him help him if you if you know of a need and you can meet a need and meet a need but let's watch out for each other right now that's we're a family and god's put us together to watch for each other and care for one another and if you know of a need and you know you can't meet that need talk to one of the deacons and the deacons will make sure they get with whoever needs help we want to help one another because we're here for each other we're one family this is why god's brought us together and so we want to watch out for each other we want to encourage each other in the faith now is not the time to stay apart call one another text one another get together whenever you can and encourage one another in the word now is the time to be quoting scriptures and quotes to one another now's the time to be reminding each other of what we're standing on and what we're standing for and what god has done in our lives and what he intends to do and now is the time to really encourage one another this is the time to get closer not further apart this is the time to show greater brotherly love than than before and let the love of christ be expressed among us and this is also a time to be led by the spirit of god because everything is is changing i could say it that way everything's changing some things are becoming confusing some things are becoming more clear but it's going to take individual leadership to navigate the changes to know when to speak and when not to speak when to move and when not to move when to go and when to stay there's times that and we don't know that things will get more difficult or less difficult we don't know anything that'll happen next all i know is god's in control that everything's ticking just right on time but with that being said we need a greater sensitivity to the spirit of god and quit using our brains and be led by the inward inward movement of the spirit of god and let god tell us when to speak who to speak to when to be quiet right no more no more just doing things our own way amen the world used to be predictable it used to be steady you used to know what you used to we used to believe we knew what we were going to do on monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday we had the week planned out we had the calendar full and now god is god has taken away some of those things to say hey you know what i have no idea what will happen two hours from now but praise god i know who does i know the one who knows what'll happen two hours from now two months from now two years from now if there's that much time left in this condition i know the one who knows and so i just want to hold his hand because i don't know the next step i'm going to have to take but he's already got it figured out he already saw it in his mind before the foundation of the world and he's purposed that i would be here to act out what he's already seen and so now's the time you know if if we've watched the way god's been preaching the word to us it's about cut off the entertainments stop the foolishness be more sincere be more dedicated be more prayerful why because god knew this hour was coming and we didn't know it but god knew it and so now is the time to be more prayerful to be more consecrated to be more sincere amen so that we can hear that still small voice and be led by the spirit of god because we're moving into those crucial hours so even just this afternoon i heard word just in the last few hours that they closed all barber shops and hair salons so brother dave and brother craig wood and brother jeremy that's that's their business that's their livelihood and now they closed all the barber shops and that wasn't in the works from what we understood earlier but in the last few hours something else changed by the time we get out of here something else can change by time we wake up in the morning something else can change and i say god hide me under your wings lead me with thy staff let thy rod comfort me let me follow the shepherd let me just be holding to your hand now's the time now is the time to be more sincere trust gone don't forget the prayer times that are here friday and saturday one to five on friday and saturday five to ten i believe they're timely i believe cod called for him on time and i i know that it's having an effect on me and i enjoy the effect that it's having on me and i pray that god will just bless us all through that time so more than anything don't be afraid don't be scared when you see everything changing there's there's turmoil everywhere but inside there's an anticipation and excitement because god's doing something something's happening something's moving and i'm part of the move i may not know fully i may not be able to explain all but i know i'm part of the move something god's moving through something god's doing in this hour and we're part of it and i've got an anticipation and an enthusiasm in the midst of trouble and i said we we need to stay close together and encourage that in one another we need to fan those flames in each other saying this is the hour for a fuller manifestation of the word god has been so good to us friends that he has he has taught us over and over out of the message who we really are breaking spiritual news is showing us where we came from and what we're here for what his purpose is and where we're going showing who the bride is and where the mercy seat is and all of these wonderful truths that he's been giving to us what age we truly live in and where we're supposed to be positioned in christ and he's done all of that and we've received all of those truths but all of those truths are just to give us confidence in who we are so we can have confidence to live what he told us to live so all of those things weren't to tantalize us and make us excited about doctrine i mean although we're quite excited about the doctrine but all those things were were put together were taught to us were brought to us so that we would have a clear understanding of who we really are so that in the hour of trouble we're not going to be shaking because we're on a firm foundation that i part of christ i come from god i go to god i will not be lost he hasn't forgot about me he did he knows exactly where i am and exactly what condition i'm in and i'm at total rest with that the headship has come to unite with the body i'm in the invisible union with my lord my headship and i don't have to be afraid or worry because he's going to take care of me all of those moved were supposed to move from teachings and doctrines to life and this is the hour we have to know who we are and what our purpose on this earth is and what he's commissioned us for and now is the time for manifestation of all we've learned i say praise be to god let us stay humble loving compassionate we're bold in faith because we believe but not arrogant and not harsh or critical bold and faith and we can talk bold with one another as much as we want but when you get on amongst a paranoid world who's scared it's time to express compassion and concern and sympathy not that we don't tell the truth but that inward spirit tells you when to speak and when not to speak [Music] amen [Music] [Music] he wants all of my heart all he wants is all of me all he wants is me let's dance we sing it in this fast first all i want is you yes lord and no one else will do no not just a part i want all of your heart all i want is all i want yes let's just raise a hand as we sing it once again yes all i want is you know what else will do not just a part i want all of your heart all i want is all [Music] jesus breaks jesus breaks [Music] every feather my jesus breaks everything and he said [Music] on the other side of jordan [Music] [Music] is amen god bless you all so good to be with you this evening i'll say it i said it on sunday i was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen now we don't know how many more times we're going to have this opportunity but while we have the opportunity i'm happy to see you hey and i always appreciate these these are precious moments for us and we want to take every opportunity to keep doing this as long as we can so if you don't mind if you'll just take your bibles we will go right to the little thought and god's laid on my heart i know it's here somewhere there it is if you could turn to exodus chapter 19. exodus chapters 19. starting at verse 3 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shout thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you up on eagle's wings and i brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my commandment then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people and for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel and if you'll also turn to isaiah 40. isaiah 40 verses 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases their strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint i believe the spirit of the lord's just leading a certain way because i think everything that brother chad said i either have that scripture i have that quote so we're just trusting the lord he knows how to encourage us in these things and these uncertain times i kept getting calls all day today from different individuals either losing their jobs or financial problems and it finally got to the point i i just said i there is no sure place to stand except for christ there is no other solid rock that i know of there's nothing i can tell you there's nothing i can say other than i would stand upon a revelation at this point in this hour so let's just go to the lord in prayer most gracious heavenly father lord we come before you lord honored and humbled lord that by your grace we know that you we are yours lord we know that you hold the earth in the palm of your hand lord your eyes on the sparrow how much more of you watching over us father lord we have such a confidence and a rest and an assurance lord that you are in total control and father god i just pray lord that you would take this evening lord i know that i'm insufficient and i'm unable lord i have no ability of my own lord god i just pray lord that you would take this consecrated time that's been set aside lord to hear your word and you would anoint me lord to move me out of the way and just say those things that you once said lord shut my lips to anything that wouldn't be right lord anything that would maybe puff me up don't allow it father for there's only one worthy lord amongst us and that's you father so lord god i just pray lord you take this time lord and you would just brew over your people lord and lord that you would just bring glory unto yourself as your word said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto me so father we're here to glorify you to honor you to respect you and to love you and to lord to look at your word and to believe it with all that is in us father god lord we love you and we know that for this great hour and this time we've been called so lord god i just pray lord that you would move and speak to us and tell us what you want us to know we love you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so a little bit of a tricky day for me to prepare it really was i'll be honest with you so it may be more just talking from my heart i just i'm a little shocked i'll be honest with you at the amount of unprecedented changes that seem to be happening every no longer a week or day but seemingly every hour but it just gives us such assurance that this world is falling apart and the only thing that will stand is god's word because he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail and i believe god likes to show his great strength on behalf of his beloved bride i just have a feeling that the mighty conqueror is still a mighty conqueror i just have a feeling that inside of him is still this longing attribute to say wait till i show my great strength to my wife to my bride who's been humbly taking me at my word for all these years i'm going to show her how much i love her and how much i've got it all under control so i am i i will i don't mean to say it arrogantly i am excited uh i am extremely excited to see what my god is going to do in an hour like this he loves moments like this when all odds seem to be getting stacked against just before the devil could accomplish his cowardly goals right it's sure paving the way for some interesting things to be happening as we go and i just wanted to share you know brother chad had mentioned there um a picture i had sent him there last sunday and because about three um three months ago i had um had my computer crashed and like all things you know i'm looking for a screen saver and i had had a conversation a couple weeks even before that with brother jeremy and i said you know brother jamie i says it's not that i don't think there's more ground to take when it comes to the word but why is there such a feeling inside of me that it's time to manifest the things that we've already taken a hold of and and it just there was just this conversation just a statement right jeremy it wasn't anything overly thought it was just a statement we were just talking i think we both agreed it just comes to a point in time we love the word like brother chad was saying but these things are preparing for us for a life to be manifested the seven still expressed in a mom and then a dad and a mechanic and a farmer who looks like all hopes are lost but they're just taking the god at his word and god is supernaturally supplying all of their needs according to his riches and glory and there's nothing out of catering he's just waiting for the opportunity so i had um you know i had preached a sermon well so i had i came across the picture and i wanted to put it on my computer like three months ago and and i just was looking for an eagle picture and this is the the picture i've been asked a lot about this picture so i wanted to at least show it to you that i had put on my my computer and it's it's just simply an eagle taking flight but um the course that it's taking is is directly into the storm it's not away from the storm right so it's an interesting situation that i hadn't even thought about and this picture never struck me brother paul until uh sister naomi sang that song a time to fly and i was just liking the picture of the eagle but i didn't realize that the direction the eagle was pointed was headed right into a storm and but it's fitting and it put me to tears after i listened to sister naomi's song and then i kind of just got overly emotional because if you also look at this um i had a i have a little portion of a computer that does facial recognition i know strange right but and if you'll notice in the top it says looking for you so i said oh could it be uh this storm's looking for me yeah i think so um so we can get upset about what's going on but i'll be honest with you it's just birth pains it's just the birth pains of a great bride that's coming forward and it's the whole earth groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god and god knows just exactly how to get out of her what he has placed into her so it comes a certain point in time you don't get too upset about it you know for this purpose came i on this earth i came here as an expressed attribute of his life and i'm here to express it and he's going to prove his word and that proving of his word is in my life and so this life has to be put to the test and he's putting it to the test each and every one of us and i'm excited for what's going to come as a result of that so in looking at that i just wanted to take some time like i said just talking to you tonight i just want to take some time at um of considering these storms that are surely coming and the the effects of the storm and the purpose of the storm for us as individuals so i titled this little thought into the storm um because here we go it was and it's um there's certain things happening i don't exactly understand a full um you know you could get almost confused just saying okay the germs and all this stuff and then you see the economic collapse so one thing is for sure this is greatly setting up some things that are are going to be um very drastic changes you see the panic in the eyes of the people my wife was getting milk at walmart the other day and you know that she said that the cashier lady stopped a woman she had a whole grocery cart full of milk and she said you can't take a whole grocery cart full of me you're allowed to have two two gallons of milk and she said the woman looked at her and got angry at him just get out of my way woman and um she told carrie i said 30 something years i've been here i've never seen a person act like that yeah so they're sh they have no sure place to stand they they're they know it they know that this is all that this world has to offer them the only safety and security they can have is what they can provide in their own hands and at the same time they're trying to grab everything we're trying our hardest to give up everything they're trying to get a hold of as much as they can and i'm doing everything i can to get rid of everything that i've uh of gathered up over the last 36 years of my life i've realized that everything i've been working so hard at was just the very things that was hindering my ability to take off flight where i was supposed to go from the beginning and this is a new paradigm and a new reality for me that i'm getting more excited about because we we know this that in this world full of independence is a sign of maturity as brother aaron said but he but in the spiritual realm of things complete dependence dependency upon god is the sign of true maturity and that's where i believe that each and every one of us has to come to and i believe these are the great opportunities god's giving us at this moment to really let go and give it away i'm not trying to see how much hand sanitizer i can stock up not trying to see how much toilet paper i can get or how much meat i can get in my freezer not at all at this point i don't want anything all i got and all i need was this from the beginning this is all we ever needed and we tried to substitute this with so many other things along the way and all it did was spiritually the bride of jesus christ and i don't say those things disrespectfully but let's be honest there was an immature bride on the scene and it was a young bride that was coming to full maturity and you know and the prophet of god in his wisdom knew he was talking to a young bride but you go listen to countdown and you'll see that he's speaking in such a way that he knows that a mature bride will come on the scene at a later date and time that'll be able to take those deeper things that'll be able to understand and take it and not take offense to it but say praise god that's where he wanted me from the beginning and that's where i'm going so these things when it comes to music and it comes to these things this is just a maturing bride that's no that's no anger at a person there's no anger at my brother or my sister hey why don't you no hey we're all guilty and we're all growing up let's grow up together let's take full possession of those things that we were called to right so it's just a maturing time it's just a maturing time and i'm a part i'm proud to be maturing with all of you all right so i appreciate how the word's been coming forward and i appreciate the cutting off cutting off cutting off right it's we know we're all guilty we all have things in areas of our unbelief that we've been compromising in for far too long each and every one of us know those little areas but little too much confidence in our ability too much confidence in our will power too much confidence and even our intellect our knowledge of the message and then none of it you didn't really set your wings you were supposed to be sons of god led by the spirit of god in all things in everything everything we do we were supposed to be able to ride that wave of the holy ghost and just have just wherever it takes me that's where i'll go so maybe god is just giving that opportunity to us once more i'm excited where that'll take us huh so if you'll turn to mark the book of mark and i did put a powerpoint together because i do have some lengthy reading i hope that's okay tonight and i didn't want to just sit here and read i know it's hard to hold your minds like that so i but i so i put the powerpoint so you can follow the direction and we're going in mark chapter 4 verse 37. it says and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awakened him and he said unto him master cares not or cares thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and brother chad brought this out so perfectly you know just to lay the foundation here what is he looking for when the storm comes on he's looking for faith and he says when i come back will i find it will i find faith when the storm comes on you know will i be saying what the word says or will i be tossed to and fro with the every wind and every wave that comes my way or will i have a steadfast assuredness that i'm standing and he's not just in the boat he's in me right for he said greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world the boat may be going down but i can't go down because he's in me right and brother branham says in calling jesus on the scene he says now christ is in the church reconciling the people to god he promised to do it as if it has been written that he is the same yesterday today and forever you believe that congregation says amen i believe it with all my heart and he is just waiting to be called on the scene now the only thing can call him on the scene is for us to awaken him in ourselves call him on the scene so many times we're looking off for a minister to do something for us or we're looking for god to come down with an angel and part the way for us and and all he's waiting for is say hey what did i put inside of you you've got the word speak and go forward right you see he's setting up the opportunity for all those little amateur gods to really express what they were called for right so now here comes the lengthy readings so let's just hang with me a little bit what is cancer what is disease we'll deal on that for the next five minutes now what is cancer what caused that thing let's take a cancer anything that you wish to take tubercular pneumonia whatever you wish to any disease diseases or germs let me pass something here quickly as our time is going listen did you know the bible predicts that in the last days there will be germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and they'll fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit but when the with the angel who or who had charge over these plagues was given orders to touch none of them who have them who the mark was why how much kind of teachers have we got to be brethren to get the church in order get the church in order first to be in that kind of a condition immune you know the government is spending billions and billions and billions of dollars trying to find the vaccine and the little do they realize it's right here there's certain things that science not going to be able to solve that it's only a spiritual immunity against and it's right here if they only knew that there was a place of refuge that there is a city of refuge a new jerusalem a bride adorned for a groom upon the earth my arms are sore now brother bam says from where doctors had punched needles into it and tried to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth i told them i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll tell you what god's going to do god's got a serum and it's called the holy ghost and when that serum goes in it inoculates you hallelujah and in the last days in these last days but look friend the time is coming that when there is rising up a church if we can't have faith for divine healing how are you going to have faith for how are you going to have how are you going to have for a rapture you've got to move out friend we've got to get out of this old slow church condition that we're in and step out launch out cut the shorelines and get out into somewhere where you lose all senses of fear and doubt out where there are all things possible brother just as free as it can be you've got to sail sail set towards heaven nothing can stir you no way you've got that way that's all nothing can harm you so maybe these are the opportunities that he wants us to set ourselves right into now that's the kind of church it's going to be one of these days according to the bible where the angel poured out his wrath and the diseases broke out and men even rotted in their flesh there where they were standing and the fowl of the air came down and eat the eat off of the shoulders and the flesh of captains and great mens and presidents and warriors and diplomats and potentiates and everything and the angel was given charge don't you come near anyone that's got the seal of god in their forehead it's going to be one of these days divine healing is going to be a great thing among the people so let's get in condition god wants us you say well brother branham you say let's that's what god's waiting on we're waiting on jesus to return and jesus is waiting on us you say well how what can we do about it the bible said that the hour has come that the bride has made herself ready amen this is the hour that she has made herself ready consecrating separating you know the great thing about jesus that really stuck out to me is he separated he consecrated himself for others he separated himself he sanctified himself he said for others sake and that great hour where he could have chosen a path that would have made him more comfortable he chose a harder way but he chose a harder way for me and you now will the bride walk in his footsteps i believe brother ben she will the sermon that we heard from brother ben we know that the bride is walking in his footsteps because she's bone of his bone life of his life the same character and attributes of jesus christ expressed in the mail is now being expressed in the female so now is our great opportunity to sanctify and set ourselves apart it shouldn't have to be that we have to get pushed and prodded we should say thank you lord i appreciate this nether opportunity to draw closer unto you and to kill myself for others sake because there's others that are going to be watching you like you've never thought before everybody's going to be watching you they're going to watch your reaction they're going to watch your word they're going to watch your emotions are going to see what happens with you under the squeeze god's setting it all up he knows how to bring attention to his bride and the thing he wants the whole world to take notice of he's setting it all up brother branham also says in 1960 god's provided way how we thank thee that in this great hour that when all hopes of mortal life is finished atomic bombs our lane and hangers and hydrogen bombs and sickness and disease and germ warfare oh god and everything the way it is knowing that the bible said that a man would actually rot in their flesh and the angel was given commission don't you touch any of those don't you come near those who has the wine and the oil don't touch those who has the seal of god upon their forehead do we have anything to be afraid of no we've already taken the vaccine we've already been inoculated let's just keep going 1963 accepting god's provided way at the end time now some of them said well now if the plagues fall we'll just go in a hospital if the plague now if the plague happens to fall you know what we'll do we'll go get dr jones we'll know he'll know how to take care of it it didn't work yet they were smart well if the plagues fall we'll just go down beneath the ground in a cave we'll shut the door that that won't do it one bit of good we'll stay home we'll put a mask over our face we'll put in some disinfectant on it didn't do a bit of good god made a provided way yes and it was what the blood god provided it as simple as it seemed to take the blood of the lamb and sprinkle the door yet god said that that was his way and he honored it all out from under the blood died the firstborn now i'm not drawing any conclusions but i'm going to make a little statement and i'm maybe going out on a limb i can be corrected i told him he could be wrong but it was a first born now we all know that something striking a certain age generation that are more susceptible at this moment very clear 70 to 80 years old most susceptible prophet of god was on the scene the word came forward and the first to reject it i may be going on a limb but at least just it's interesting may not be true it's just interesting but they died who rejected the simplicity of a prophet and his message in their day and they rejected the pathway to the blood was which was by the word in its simplicity and they made they said it's foolishness it's nonsense we have our churches we have our doctrines we have our creeds we don't need what that fanatic is saying and they're going to call us fanatics for saying these things but that's okay i'm in good company christ comes 1954. christ comes three times the first time he came to redeem his church is that right the second time he comes to receive his church and the third time comes with his church he come to redeem her he comes to rapture her and be caught away in the time of the plagues and so forth returns back to the millennium and lives through the millennium wow and i'm getting more excited time just keeps moving on so we've got nothing to fear now let's go to psalms 27 i i don't mean to be moving but we just have a lot to read and lot to go through and i just want to bring one little portion of this obviously i have it highlighted but i think it'd be good for us to read this brother branham preaches the rapture quotes psalms 27 psalm of david the lord is the light of as my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came up to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though and hoes should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy so you want to know the greatest witness in this time be happy smile yeah don't let nothing put a frown on your face conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trial brother ben i'm saying and now shall my head be lifted up on my enemies and my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i was seeing praises unto the lord boy there's another one next time you're in walmart you know what to do start singing with a big old smile on your face there you go you're going to stand out like a sore thumb and it'll set quite a testimony in the place of panic like that hear o lord when i cry with my voice and have mercy upon me and answer me when thou said i seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not thy face far from me and put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up now i just want to hone in on that when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up and i had always read that many times and i gotta think well maybe my mom reject me my dad reject me my family would reject me and that could be that could be part of it i don't doubt that many of us have all went through that in some form or fashion but just want to think about this for a moment um but the the hebrew word here for forsake is as as ab to leave or to loose or to forsake or to depart from or to leave behind to let alone to leave abandon forsake neglect to let loose of to set free let go to free and i want to look at ephesians 5 for this call shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak to you concerning christ and the church so i know this may sound a little strange but you know let's just take me for a moment for many many years of my life i had a name of a kyle weikert i had a reputation and i had an identity that i found in my dad and our family and as time grew on i i went to school and i got strong and i played sports and had a lot of confidence in the physical body that i had and the intellectual mind that i had and had an ability to maybe navigate through work life and do certain things and had confidence in my reasoning abilities and my you would say ability to interact with people i had a lot of confidence in the things that always provided for me for my whole life you know a man's strength provides for him a man's intellect provides a way for him gives him a certain identity but in just thinking of that as a child as just a little girl you would say she's completely identified in her home with her mother and her father and that's all she knows but as that little girl comes to full maturity she one day leaves everything that once provided for her protected her gave her her identity and she's handed off to fully embrace another man and i just wonder a little bit from me and for each of us for how long have we been finding our security and our confidence and our strength and our human reasoning and our human ability willpower strength family name family tradition strong heritage but there comes a point in time i got to leave it all to unite with christ there comes a point in time where nothing else can go in there just me and him my intellect can't go my reasoning can't go my emotions can't go it's just me faith taking hold of him the word that's it so maybe it's not a bad thing when all these things start to fail and my mother and my father forsake me because maybe that's finally for the first time in my life that the lord will truly take me up remember my uh sermon there on enoch's journey home you know he just was walking with the lord and slowly everything was falling away until one day he walked with god so long that god took him just gathered him right up into myself he had fully maybe finally fully believed and embraced that word but step by step revelation by revelation one step at a time word by word he was building he was building coming higher coming higher coming higher until he could finally take flight i don't think it's going to be too far off for that for us just one step at a time so finally saying you know lord i can't figure this out anymore lord i really don't have an ability to navigate this situation i really don't know what to do and then he can finally say finally why don't you come with me and i think that's what we're going through and i think that's what god's preparing us for a truly forsaking of all things and just taking god at his word at this point so another little lengthy reading um brother branham says an eagle in her nest and you know there may be many a little eagle been walking in some old denominational chicken yard for a long time sitting here tonight that's right but i hope that he calls you and says son you're mine what must i do lord that was the cry she said just make first big jump and flop your wings and he made the first jump and flopped his wings and he found out he wasn't earthbound anymore because he sat on a barnyard post right in the center of a pentecostal organization his mother said son you've got to come higher than that or you can't or i can't get you said just give another jump and i'll bear you up on my wings you see so it's a good thing to forsake all it's a good thing to abandon and be forsaken by mother and by father and everything that once gave us strength and hope and protection because that one next jump throws us right into his arms and that's where we're going by faith if there's anything the church of the living god needs tonight it's another jump from all the barriers of denomination from all the isms just cut loose every life every line go free and jump he will bear you away on the wings of the great speckled bird it's such meetings as this at such times as this it's such an audience as this where he can make it make that great jump to feel his power reach under reach under us with his word and bear us away from the little earthly cares and things that we have he's your father and he loves you the nest during time has already come but we need another jump we got to the barnyard post but we need to get free so we can just ride on his wings for our first solo flight what a joy it will be when that great final day comes and those that know how to jump and flop their wings those who know how to do it someday he'll come that great eagle of the sky shall come in glory and he'll spread forth his great power the holy spirit and those who are magnetized to it shall take a ride for eternity forever amen you see why i'm saying what i said let's take one more jump we did jump we know we're not earthbound but we gotta take one more jump and that's a reckless abandonment to take god at his word an absolute reckless abandonment you almost literally have no i'm not saying almost you must lose your mind you absolutely have to lose your mind and i promise you it's scriptural shamgar one day lost his mind absolutely lost his mind and i shared with the kids a while back ago you know what the bride of jesus christ needs she needs 600 philistines marching towards her right now to take everything that she's got because finally she'll put no more confidence in herself one last time and take god at his word as brother branham said here he heard something coming up the road here come a thousand philistines armed spears swords hanging on their sides trained men trump trump right up the road they came and little shamgar stood there what could he do he was a farmer he wasn't a soldier he didn't have nothing to fight with he looked sitting in the corner there was an ox goat that's just an interesting thing he has not a training there's no training he's got nothing to fight with the only thing he has is the only thing that can deliver him faith in the word of god that's it at the end of the day there will be nothing else that can stand it's going to be so simple it's going to be so humble that most of the world will reject it it's too simple you mean just simple humble faith little hyssop taking the blood and applying the blood upon the doorpost of my life this simple faith i don't need to be able to jump through mental hoops with you no just simply taking him at his word he'll do the rest so losing your mind is not a new thing you don't think david lost his mind david lost his mind david why are you you you take on a lion that's no common sense maybe we should actually put a little bit of common sense to this right you know let's be honest this this thing is pretty bad this virus is pretty bad and we need to be balanced in our approach in these things we need to use some common sense show me where common sense is anywhere in the bible there's no common sense in the bible david had no you would say common earthly sense what common sense says i'm going after that lion what common sense says that bear i'm taking you out what common sense of a little boy where an entire army of trained men are too afraid tackles an 11-foot goliath what's where's the common sense in this where's the common sense of shamgar where's the common sense where's the balanced approach nonsense with a balanced approach all that was was human reasoning still mixed with the word of god that was producing death all along and it crippled the little bride but i am thankful that god that we have been forsaken by mother and father and we're leaving those things and taking our god-given position by faith in the word and we're losing our minds and taking on a goliath who are you uncircumcised philistine to defy the armies of the living god who are you you're gonna each and everyone have that opportunity to take your stand so simple and so humble but we're going to get that opportunity brother baum says oh yes he permits crosses and crossroads and junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for his service he permits those things to happen can't you understand that congregation amen he does that so he can perfect you for the calling he's called you for that's your growing pains he did daniel that way you know he did the hebrew children in the fiery furnace what did the fiery furnace do the fiery furnace only broke the bands that had them bound that's all the furnace did just burnt loose the bands sometimes it takes trials to break the bands of the world off of us take you out of the world might be have to take you out of your creed first like the man drowning in the river you have to take him out of the river before you can get the river out of the man so i think the fiery trials and storm are the very thing the bride needs to finally let loose to to really throw off everything because do you know what to do anybody tell me what they should do in the next 30 days tell me how to plan tell me how what what should any of us do to get ready for this and nobody has an answer the entire federal government doesn't have an answer the federal reserve doesn't have an answer the doctors don't have an answer the whole world doesn't have an answer what a blessed place we are in man because i have the answer i know the answer he's my father i know him personally all i have to do now is a complete reckless abandonment and saying god finally i'm not going to put any confidence and planning into this anymore lord you're going to take me just where you want me to go and i'm going to express that great purpose that i was on this earth for him from the beginning so let's not get upset this is the greatest blessing that's ever come towards us show us thy father and it will suffice um okay so now so i wanted to go to this it's a little story and you all know the story so i'll just read a portion of it brother branham talks about he's in the woods there and i began to hear something i looked over to my side and there said a little old pine squirrel i don't know whether you have them here or not that's the noisiest thing in the woods there it was setting up there with a little tail throwed up just going chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter like he was going to tear me to pieces i thought did i excite you little fella i didn't aim to but i said oh you're like i did hallelujah hallelujah oh how wonderful and he kept chatter chatter chatter his cotton blue eyes looked down like that and i thought you're not watching me and all at once i noticed a great big old eagle that had been forced down in a storm under this blow down and this story just come back to my mind you know because here we are talking about eagles here we are talking about eagles going right into the storm and here we have a story of an eagle that got blown down maybe he didn't tackle that storm quite like he was supposed to and sometimes that can happen to you and it has certainly happened to me we look back in life circumstances i look back at situations and trials that came my way and you know what they blew me down they put me hiding behind in a dark place you know just i didn't i didn't take it right i didn't handle it right and it comes to each and every one of us sometimes the storms of life just us spiritually you and maybe sometimes you may even feel like that's why i even put this in it's like i just feel like maybe sometimes you may be looking at the trials ahead you're looking at the storm scum you know what you're called to do and you remember that last time you didn't pass the test you ran you went and hid you didn't even tackle it you gave up and i've been there and i think each and every one of us has been here and i don't think you can live long enough and walk with the lord long enough where there's times you can look back in your life or you hang your head say lord i know i let you down right there i have but i'm not looking back at that as an excuse to not tackle the storm ahead i'm looking back at that and it's driving me to take on that storm because i'm saying it's going to be different this time there's something on the inside of me and it's saying not this time you might have got me there you might have discouraged me and put me in a corner and i really messed up and i really got down but not not no more you see because brother brown begins to say uh any let me jump to this one so after a while he got tired of looking at that little pine squirrel listening to him and so he just made one big jump and if you remember the little pine squirrel saying days and miracles over jesus christ ain't the same yesterday today and forever see just a chatter chatter what was he trying to do trying to get you to disbelieve don't take god at his word but you just even though that eagle got blowed down there was just something in that eagle that could only take such unbelief for so long he finally got sick and tired of all the chatter chatter chatter we can't take god at his word you're getting too extreme you're losing your mind you need to stay balanced the ego just finally had enough of it at one point so he just made one big jump flopped his wings a couple times and he was out of the bushes out into the midair then i cried and he never flopped anymore he never tried to flop his wings to get away he just set his wings and every time that air would come in he just knowed how to set his wings out into that air just lift him up i watched him the air came in and lifted him up lifted him up until he went plum out of sight leaving that little old pine squirrel setting there cursing and going on his way i thought that's it lord not a jump jump here run run there join methods join baptist come back be baptized this way this way it's it's just setting your wings of faith in a humble of the holy ghost comes in right rise from it on and on and on plum out of sight leaving this old earth bound doctrine here chatter chatter chatter days of miracles past chatter chatter chatter don't get the holy ghost leave it soar away go on set your wings right away god sends the winds to ride up on it so let everybody do their arguing their fussing they're uh you know it's a shame but it's true it's what constantly happens a man of insecurity has to put down another man so he can feel like he's adequate and at this point i says god bless you all i'm just waiting for the wind to come i'm setting my wings i'm getting them ready i'm tired of all the chatter chatter chatter and the day's a miracle and you're the you can't do that you can't that's okay there's just something inside of me it says i still got some god-given wings here i'm gonna take my flight i'm just gonna take my flight i'm just i'm done with it not chattering chattering back let the squirrels do what they must they must be there you know what i think this growth purpose is to annoy the eagles they're just there to put that final poke in them like i'm tired of this i'm out of here not fussing not arguing just gone just saying enjoy earthbound conditions i'm going higher [Applause] amen read between the lines the difference shalom the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and god separated the light from the darkness and i believe that we are now living in the hour again that when god is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light may be made manifest and we are then the church the reason i'd say shalom to them is because that it's god's peace that's what i want to bring to you this morning for this new year's not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great lying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that we've looked forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking over the horizon the horizontal rain it's breaking between mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from earthbound sickness and troubled world into the bright and shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that shall never pass away its shalom to the church now it's light time coming for the believers but gross darkness for the people good morning shalom the world is falling apart shalom peace they are truly in gross darkness and have no no hope but shalom arise and shine thy light has come and so this was the other screensaver that i put on my computer about three months ago the first one was when you open it it has to identify you and that's the eagle that's taking on the storm but that eagle doesn't stay in the storm forever he just knows that that storm is necessary to lift him up into the heavenly realms where his heavenly father is and that's exactly what each and every one of us know and don't mean to talk so simple but you know it's the truth deep down on the inside of you you know that that is right that it's just the simplicity of taking god at his word in moments like this where every storm is coming your way that's actually going to be the very thermal dynamics needed for the eagle to throw her up into the heavenly realms from which she came and that's where we're going as mark 16 said and he said unto them go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature in good times and in bad he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it will not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is my promise as the story goes brother bam said about the woman if god could heal me with that which is uninspired what will he do with that which really is inspired so you see don't back down keep going you have a hope that lies within you little did you know what god's placed on the inside now is just the time and the opportunity for the full expression of those little secrets that god had in the back part of his mind now being expressed in the time in which you're living yeah each and every one of us musicians if you'll come i told you i wouldn't i don't think i told you i wouldn't be long i told you i was going to talk to you i want to close with this the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval so it could get dark but don't think of it god's disapproving of things neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which we he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know how shall we know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said my that little eagle might have got discouraged blown down by a big storm but there was still something inside him that believed what god said you got something inside of you still says i just believe what god said so what do we do believe what he said and by conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass so smile and sing the next time you're going through walmart it's going to please your lord be happy lose your job smile no more money smile no more food smile just be happy god knows what he's doing he may send ravens to feed you it's going to get really exciting i know each and every one you want to come up on some sunday morning says everybody got testimony i ran out of food this week and a bunch of ravens flew in brought me a steak dinner baked potato and green beans i'm waiting for it it's okay it'll be a good time when it happens right so why don't you all stand with me i hope that's okay yeah i trust the lord in his leadership let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord we just come before you this evening lord always so thankful your word is our comfort your word lord gives us joy in the midst of great trials lord it it's just it's the very thing that we stand upon it's the very thing that's the anchor of our life and we love it and lord we just love you and we are want to thank tell you how much we we believe you we trust you we know you're in complete control no matter how dark it gets lord we believe you lord we just know that there's something on the inside of us that's your grace that's the love that you gave to us that still believes your word lord we know we're being conformed day by day into your image lord i just pray lord that you bless your people lord may they go forth with joy in their hearts because no matter what this is going to get better for each and every one of us maybe the mother and father forsake us maybe there will be nothing else that we once put our hopes in we could rest on but lord may we each and every one of us realize all that was were bands and chains keeping us earthbound stuck in an earthbound condition finally those fiery flames of the trial are going to burn those bands off and set your ego to flight lord we thank you for your word we thank you for this fellowship i personally lord appreciate each and every one i appreciate every face every mom and dad and child young person faithfully standing on the word it's an encouragement to me lord i just love the family of god i love the people and just appreciate it and just pray lord that you'll bring us back together at a time you see fit lord and your purpose and in your plan and lord go with us wherever we go lord may the joy of the lord be my strength may it shine upon my countenance lord people will recognize he's in contact with something and i got to know what that is lord from my depths of my heart i know friends and family and people that i still want to reach and lord maybe it was just too comfortable the world was just too comfortable for them to really even have a need or recognize the need that they had i just pray lord that each and every one of us will be at the scene at the right time lord expressing the right word to the right person lord just as you've ordained it in your great symphony lord we want to be there to play our part in the symphony when it comes our turn we love you lord we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen brother chad if maybe we'll sing christ the solid rock i stand i don't know how to start it though oh here we go i dare not trust the sweetest rain but holy jesus [Music] is [Music] unchanging with is [Applause] [Music] on is [Music] praise the lord i'm i was greatly edified by the word tonight and greatly encouraged more than anything friends we need to never forget the abcs we need to never forget the application of the word in our lives that it's got to live that everything we've been taught has to live and you know i was thinking there at the end when brother kai was talking brother ben talked about that great sculpture he's been working on in the masterpiece you know we know he started with the male part of the masterpiece but the masterpiece is a masterpiece family husband and wife together and he's been through seven church ages working on the female part of that masterpiece and in the studio time alone with the master's hand has been so beautiful he's just talking to you and telling you i'm taking this away and i'm fashioning you this way and we've had all this time in the studio but brother branham says before that piece of work can go to the hall of fame first it has to pass through the hall of critics and if it was up to us we would stay in the studio forever but god's going to eventually take his masterpiece and put it on display and it'll pass the test of every critic and he'll move it into the hall of fame you know that's the part we've been trying to avoid do you believe that that's the part we've been trying to avoid we've enjoyed the studio with just us and him we're going to enjoy the you know the hall of fame restored to an eden condition but to get from there to there we must be on display and pass through the hall of critics and we would have avoided it we would have never chosen it amen we would have just stayed where we were but god is moving the circumstances because this is going to be again the unveiling of christ in bride form and it's going to pass through the holy critics but don't be discouraged it's going to the hall of fame god is working circumstances that we would have never worked god is doing things that we would have never voluntarily done we were too comfortable but thank god he loves us and he will do everything he said he's going to do and he will bring to pass everything he said he's going to bring to pass because his word won't fail so i thank god i thank him for what he's doing jesus for the glory that lay ahead endured the cross despising the shame jesus come to a place where he had to go through the cross through the hall of critics to be crucified and in order to do that he had to set his eyes higher beyond the temporary into the eternal and for the glory that lay ahead he endured the cross despising the shame remember this wasn't something he was looking forward to he prayed three times that this cup could pass him as a human as a man there's a dread there was an agony there was an angst in his heart coming into this time amen but he surrendered his will to the will of the father and moved forward before the glory that lay ahead i tell you maybe it's time for us to quit thinking about the earth the carnal things and let's start setting our eyes on what's coming next and walk forward with our vision set forward not on the temporal but on the eternal oh i was encouraged tonight if we find ourselves with a little more time off let's have some more fellowship let's not waste what's what's what's coming our way if god is stripping away some things and we find ourselves working from home or not working or whatever happens you know that the kids are already not in school and so if we find ourselves with more time let's have more fellowship let's spend more time in the word let's do the things we know are going to really count in this hour that we're alive let's not waste it and squander it on things that matter for nothing but let's start taking our time and putting it the things that matter the most amen god bless you guys amen can you sing that song this world is falling
