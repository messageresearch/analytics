else but the very Mortals that you gave us we're bringing all that we are to you and father asking you to forgive us of anything that affected us father on this Earth that father thr the blood of Jesus Christ who could be again cleansed tonight to be presented to you as an offering that you can use these mortals that were once under subjection of the things of the earth and you can take them you can nourish them and you can use them for the very purpose for which you created us and Lord we thank you for the time you have allowed our even little beings to live in knowing the abundance of your Revelation in this hour we are standing in all and what we would ask you tonight father come again among us as Lord prayers have gone forth that you will be Lord the one sharing every story Lord this little man standing here has nothing to offer but when you if you come and you hide behind Lord you would give something and do go do the same towards my brothers and sisters go behind them as well that father will not be Mortals to Mortals but you will be Immortals Behind The Mortals connecting to the immortal Behind The Mortals back there that your name will forever be glorified father let Lord every voice Lord every sound father of your beloved Children Here testify y of you in this living days that you are the same yesterday today and forever be with us father in this little report we will be sharing father and also the thought you have placed upon us Lord It's bits but you you can use one word father just to speak directly to a soul we committing Lord the service again into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray amen God bless you all you may be seated now I have the daunting task of uh running the God bless you beloved brothers and sisters thank you um the first portion was is going to be the report mission report that uh after we went there um just a couple of weeks ago came from uh Congo DR Congo which is in Africa so actually the trip was meant to uh not only for the preaching of the word but also to helping brothers and sisters that are needy so we know that in the Book of James it says if you only profess that you have faith and your brother is in need you will not sent him back home and said I will be praying for you whatever you have you will give him and that's Faith so faith has actions amen yeah faith is not empty empty faith that time was in uh the church church ages this time the bride sees another member of the Bride in need we have nothing we we can hold on to ourselves so that's why we're going to be uh sharing here but before I go sometimes it's easy to forget I know that I forgot the last time I was here giving uh a mission uh report about uh me me and Brother Andy uh Randy Randy SAS going to the Congo I forgot to mention that brother Nathaniel sas's son who is the pastor in the church there they did um support that mission with all the the fair even the internal Fair within the Congo providing even where to stay in the food so brother Nathaniel has and the church provided us uh to us and we want to be very grateful to for that also in the other missions um charitable missions I have a two families at uh the true world that are very faithful since we shifted from uh Haiti and the Dominican Republic going to the Congo for a mission and charity uh those families have been very faithful every year supporting us with whatever need they have whatever means they have so we can fulfill some needs so we're going to be studying this this is a journey I think I left here uh May 31st and then uh headed uh to Belgium first uh you will see so it's uh that's how my journey started uh from the US then uh to uh Brussels Belgium and then from there we have a few more hours to uh fly down to kinasa which is the capital city uh on the northwest side no Southwest side of uh of the Congo where we started our uh Journey there so we went not only we did um uh preach but also we were mindful of the needy not only among Brothers and Sisters of the same Faith but also we have some other places we go like at the nursing homes where people elderly that are very sick some will hear the word of God for the very last time and we it's just that God if someone could hear your word wherever they might be just send us so he leads us the way he wants to lead us so and also visiting some orphanages there are so many stories that standing here we will not even uh uh get a start on that so we land I left here on U Thursday Thursday U noon and landed there on Friday night it takes over 27 Plus hours of flying so that's uh in the Congo I don't know which okay so I see so the Congo is uh it's it might be the second or first largest country in Africa so it has over5 million and um um it has the these are the old provinces they used to have eight provinces now it has probably 26 they have kind of divided the them up so that's at the airport so I am well guarded there so nobody can touch me I have uh a brother of mine who works for the government he's in the security and knowing that sometimes for American when they come over so just to avoid some people bothering them maybe on the roads or to check who they are might harm you so he managed to send me uh two Jeeps with those uh those army army guys so I was well guarded there God God knows how to provide his help said hey you know what you're going to serve me there I'm going to take care of you I'm going to I'm going to provide for you and then the next one will be I know you remember this this is the church that you contributed to put the roof on top and not only that so to provide even for the rest rooms they didn't have restrooms so they got some restrooms so this is how the church looked like so that's where uh we we started our uh service on Sunday Sunday morning with uh Pastor Matthew is there so this is uh just inside this is the the pastor so you will see that the the pictures are kind of more lighter so I don't know how they do it but uh so that's uh me um Pastor Matthew and uh his wife in the in the church himself his wife in the congregation are sending their greetings to you all and also sending their gratefulness for all that you have done for them now they have a a church a building they are no longer running away when it's raining or when it's a Dusty or windy so they can have services and the people even staying there sleeping in the church sometimes just as they feel led to pray overnight they're very very grateful so all of them and that's the the inside of uh uh the the congregation the the church building so it's uh got new chairs new uh I don't know what else they have there am I forget but um it it did help them a lot so they are they're feeling uh your love and they know that there's a uh a portion of the Bride somewhere that is uh well caring for them yeah so that's uh me there and uh the translated that's on Sunday morning as we're speaking there and that's uh the audience also we have a um just taking little pictures there to show how uh the building looks inside and the new chairs and the new sitting places so they're very grateful and we had a wonderful time there in the Lord that's still in the church and so this one this is a that's a widow um she I think before I got there brother Matthew has uh texted me that that we have a widow um a sister Widow in the church but she would love to come to the service and she was in the hospital in those hospitals because they're so poor sometimes if you don't have money they will not let you get out of the hospital they will hold your Ransom there for a couple of days until someone comes and redeems you so we were able to provide the Redemption price so she was able to get out of the hospital and then there are a couple of sisters here and brothers that I'm very grateful that are supporting the the the charity a couple of sisters here gave something I said okay she's going to be enjoying that we got some materials to make her the outfit she's she's having there those are new so I know uh sisters that did that uh God bless you so she's there she was very happy to be able to not only get out of the hospital to be able to come to the service and to find that we had a a little package for for her this is after the service that's a group of Believers that uh decided to be baptized that day so we have I think we have two brothers there were three brothers one was not there maybe stepped away three brothers and those uh Five Sisters they uh were baptized uh that after service they were uh moved by the the the preaching of the word and these are some of the ministers that came around they have a um I think small congregations in the area and they came in they uh with their um um the Believers some of the Believers in their congregation so most of them they go to places that I would not be able to get there so places that a car cannot go there even a motorcycle they have to walk sometime take a little little boat on a on on a body of water to cross and go preach very poor and remote area and the those are the brothers are doing the job they're willing to do that and with our little Charity we're supporting them every month with just something that they would not lack any transportation or if they have any need to go minister to those remote areas and it's not very expensive but we we we're glad to do that because this gospel that's the only message living message I has to go through the land amen and then that was on Sunday and on Monday so the we had no service Monday I had to do the charity work so I went to a place got the needs of some uh Believers in the area couple of churches and we did provide some rice some uh uh flowers semolina flowers maze uh beans and uh powder milk those kind of things and some even needed seeds to just go do uh their farming to go to their field so I'm there uh as we were Distributing that after purchasing stacking them someplace and then we we start working there I have a little video because we had just hundreds and hundreds of uh images pictures didn't want to take a long time but this is uh this would be for the same Monday in the afternoon if I can remember to yeah the same day so as we went to I think nursing home and uh and a couple orphanages we visited so I we we had to drive almost sixth time with that uh that jeep there or seven time just to be able to pick up go deliver pick up go deliver because we didn't have any big one that's a cath Catholic n at a Catholic uh place they are taking care of the the elderly they are very sick some down here so they're very critical condition so we get a chance to go visit them then after they eat we get into one room where we can share May maybe 30 minutes of the word of God in in the Catholic place and that's Catholic none there she is giving a testimony that the are people that come and visit us here but when you come it's different you have a different Spirit what kind of Faith do you have so we talked and so she's uh she asked for me to bring her a tablet I said if I bring you a tablet of what I believe would you be able to receive he said bring it to I'll be able to keep it to take it so next time I will be taking a tablet a message to give to her yeah that's uh I think this is before we had u a devotion with them so I did have a devotion I was at the kitchen just trying to do to help them uh she's uh she's very very grateful that every time I come there that please uh come and visit us okay and then on on Tuesday on Tuesday I had to go to brother Matthew's place there was a little place we had to speak so we got to his church first the church uh you supported here and then got some ministers and then we did visit the sister the Widow sister she got some more materials for uh her uh dresses she was a very grateful that she was standing cuz she hasn't been feeling good she wasn't feeling good 3 weeks prior to that so she was just having a jubilee there knowing that I was there we did provide for food Provisions so she was very grateful and uh all of them they sending just their greetings to whoever is sending us there and then uh that's the place we did speak on Tuesday it's a building so inside there but people are receiving the word they don't have any building they can just get whatever they have but they desire they long to hear the word of God and when you bring the fresh word they're just receiving it yes with uh with whole heart yeah so they didn't invite the people to come and that's the inside uh before I uh I I I went to the the pulpit that's the same place that was on Tuesday and on Wednesday we had to visit a couple of orphanages too so that's the place there's a a none again Catholic people so seems like where the Catholics are we trying to slip in yeah to slip in and the reason I'm going mostly to the Catholic people they they this they are a bit sincere when when you you you coming there you providing the means they with all they know of the Catholic they're still able to keep what you give them some other places you you're not sure what they're going to be doing with what you give so with them I have confidence that whatever you give is going to go to the orphans orphans or going to the Elder Le or sick so they're I'm I'm I'm confident so knowing that they will do what you you ask them to do or whatever the need is usually it's before I go there they can send me through WhatsApp a list of items or anything they have need of I said hey we have people that are sick uh and we cannot afford the hospitalization would you be able to help we have need of this and that and then with that in mind before I go I know what to provide for them and then we organize it whatever we find on the spot there so was there having so this the one sitting down I know knew her 5 years ago she was probably 14 now she's no maybe 13 she's 18 and then she's helping with our other orphans as well she's an orphan who is there going to school but she's willing to stay in the orphanage to take care of other orphans as she remember how she she used to be so talking to my friends the uh the nons there so mostly sharing the word so usually they have a habit when the kids are together before they eat the they pray they're Catholic prayer but when I come there always ask me to pray and I pray the way we do pray and they see the difference and said what is the difference between our God and your God now it's a long the answer would be probably I don't know how to to start but somewhere the message gets across and they are they just want to learn more they don't want to be it in open for now but as I go there I just tell them about the message that uh God has sent us a prophet with the the Revelation that's taking the bride back uh to her groom okay that's still at the same place uh that was in kesta and on Wednesday Thursday I did uh fly out to the east side of GMA so where GMA is North outside of the north of north of it is Ronda another small country and south of it is um no North is uh Uganda you have Uganda North you have a Ronda and then you have a Burundi there are three countries that are there so uh where brother Abraham is northeast of the Congo there and so this is I didn't plan to go and stay in this hotel it's festar Hotel there's a friend of mine a family friend who learned that every time I go to the cono he heard that I usually go there he said what is he coming what is he doing he when he comes from the USA here so some friends said he he comes either to preach the word or to go help the needy so he was moved he said okay since he's doing that I'm going to be surprising him I want to put him in the best Hotel wherever he's going to be going to to the east so he texted me and I said he said hey where you when are you headed to the east I said I'm going to the east this uh this this morning otherwise afternoon and then he said okay I I'll text you back in a couple of minutes so in a few minutes maybe 10 or 15 minutes he texted me he said he has uh one of his he's overseeing the entire country probably under Secretary of State and or something like that no secretary in of mining so he got the the head of mining in the entire uh province of uh of north of gomma to come and pick me up at the airport and take me to this hotel without without any dispute so brothers were coming to pick me up uh there was a pastoring brother in the GMA so they came also but but the guy wanted me just to be picked up by his so we're following um uh going our the car we had two cars headed back to the to the hotel room so that's where I stayed there so it's a nice place uh to rest I didn't so as brother Shad you said that uh this is the cheapest hotel I ever stayed in brother 0 paid was $225 per night and uh wellfed anything so that's from my uh my uh my the window from my room there so looking at the at the at the the the it's um it's a lake the lake that's separating the three countries uh that was on Friday night uh this I got it on probably Friday Saturday morning and then Sunday we had to speak uh in GMA with G Tabernacle so we had a a translator there and then on um Monday Monday we drove from the the place uh the church was 15 or 20 minutes from the hotel we drove probably about an hour to go far into the mountains so I don't know how to explain it big companies uh tech companies like uh Samsung apples those big uh manufacturing companies when they uh are acquiring whatever products they need to make their devices maybe Cobalt maybe lithium I don't know those are minerals so they are dealing with some companies within Africa within Europe instead of them going on the open market maybe the company um markets for the the government to purchase the minerals they don't do that what they do they are um I think they are giving money to militia from neighboring countries people that probably never went to school and they are going to terrorize people that are living in the East uh of GMA mostly poor people farmers in their uh KCK them out of their places because they want to get that by uh by force with guns drugs so in the Congo you have in the Eastern side of the GMA where we went there was about 1.5 million uh people that were displaced from their homes and among those we have hundreds of Believers message Believers so we went to visit those uh hundreds of message Believers in the camps so you will see that's the the place they are staying away from their homes they've been there probably more than uh 16 months and they don't know how long they were going to be there because the government is very slow to fight back those militias as they are spread out so this is a little video of um the place we went how poor they are and we have brothers and sisters that live in those conditions there this was the smallest site probably about 4 400,000 in the area but there was a bigger one which has probably 8,000 800,000 so I'm standing there with a yellow t-shirt Lu see kids are there and uh so to see how poor it is this is one of the churches message churches that brothers and sisters are attending those in the camps displaced from their homes from their livelihoods so they are there CH I think Tuesday Thursday Saturday and Sunday to have services in those places there the picture makes it look better look nicer outside and so we're able to go inside the church so those are that's not a tin roof it's they just put some little tents cloth anything if it's raining so that's the inside the sort the church there so we're able to meet the pastor the the deacons and uh some standing there with the pastor on my U on my left there and one of the deacons talking they don't even have sufficient benches for people to sit in so where we standing there it's in the TR trenches when it's raining so they made a way so maybe on Sunday morning it's raining they have to sit to one side so the water could uh could make its way there through the middle so we did uh with uh the love offering you gave to the first church here that we built we still had some remaining funds that we're going to be helping them to get the roof in the meantime to get the the seting benches and whatever is remaining we're going to see what we're going to do cuz they're not going to be there for a long time we don't know how many months but at least so they can have a place where they're not getting uh wet when it's raining or when it's anything so so that's the place we we visited so very very heartbreaking when you go to those places so I have U the pastor two pastors there and uh two deacons yeah very very very nice people and very respectful of the message and the love of the message with all their hearts and when we visit them like this they're asking how did you even know that we're here said God has children that uh know he knows how to make his way to find you yeah and then we came back on uh so this is can remember this day I might have skipped the day so arrived on Friday preached on uh no on on Thursday preached on Friday Saturday Went to went to the place and this is on Sunday yeah this is Sunday same place and then with our translator there uh that's uh the the church place it's still has a have needs but at least they are able to have a roof over the top of them and have seting places which is good so that's uh thank you during the service so we had a wonderful time with uh the open book yeah and then this is after the service so the sisters on one side getting out and this is uh Brothers uh getting out twoo and some sisters also after the service there because when I go to the Congo um should see me sometimes I go with seven suitcases sometimes eight so it depends how many I I would have maybe cloth clothing maybe um wheelchairs folded wheelchairs to help those that are in need so anything we we take there but and then after the service just for uh some of our brothers and sisters here that uh are probably sending their clothing I said okay let me get some couple of pictures just to show that they arrived so after the service we we regrouped some of the sisters on one area or some brothers and that's uh when we're uh handing out some uh some the clothing for those that are needy they don't have uh maybe mostly our widows don't have a a working husband so they're by their own as we give them if some money there we provide them for the provisions as well just to be able to share share something so charitable work so and they're very grateful for that so excuse me if you see me holding up a a dress or a skirt it's just to make sure hey it arrived but so this this these are just the samples of uh some places I know um that's a seabold little little cloth there so they arrived brother okay so some places yeah that's a brother just just had a baby and did have means to get the clothing but you know what some sisters here Who provided for the clothing yeah for the baby so these are some of them uh a few of them on that Sunday but the remaining we sent to some other churches according to the needs so they would get and uh we would check with the deacons or um the pastors of those places whatever need they have the L we have we just share it cuz we might leave it anytime anytime any minute who who knows or tomorrow we'll be here so all right so that's what we do and then the following day I did go visit um another an orphan orphanage again in the East it's uh just heartbreaking little stories there that we would not even have time to share here a lot of uh heartbreaking moments so kids would just come there would visit them and just after we play we eat and then just sharing word to them that uh they will know that God still cares for them yeah so they're sitting there this place I think they have 40 there's another place they had probably 72 I don't have the pictures here but I did visit at least a couple of orphanages there and uh so and visit that t some pictures and went on one of the orphanages um and the place they were sleeping so I it doesn't even look like a little bedroom there the beds the sleeping on the so we decided I'm already we are with a little funds from the charity we're providing some beddings and some mattresses so and then we're going to be um painting the place and just making a place little livable for them and then that was I think on either Sunday evening or Monday evening and then we went the the displaced of War those brothers and sisters who could not give them provisions on the site because it would create a stamped situation cuz people that are hungry there that don't have any means that will be rushing probably to ask for you to give them also and if there come probably 177,000 at once we cannot could not afford for 177,000 we had probably means uh provision for almost 300 so what we did the brother the Pastor said please let us uh he will tell his congregation 300 plus people to walk maybe one mile away of the big Camp to meet somewhere and there you don't even give them Provisions because once they realize that they're bringing provision from somewhere people will be rushing there it's just incidents so he advised me to give them U just money in the envelopes that they would be go back to the camps sneaking in the camps and whenever they have a need they can go purchase on their own so that's what we did uh the following this place so we're handing out it's something to the families according to the needs some they were sick some they had issues we had listed them worked with the the the the pastor and the the deacons and and other members of the church just to accommodate for those that were very needy to give more so this is what we've been doing there it was a daunting task so we have to hand out almost 317 or something like that I can't remember the number yeah but uh those are beloved brothers and sisters they're keeping up the light of the message even in the worst of the situation yeah some other plac I were just looking at them just weeping but God knows he said he put them there for a reason he put us here for a reason so it's not something that is outside of his boundaries he knows exactly what he's doing and his doings are perfect but we just uh sharing with them there so got some sisters waiting mostly most of them were widows their hus husbands were killed maybe in wars and then they they would come up and we would uh would share something and we did speak also after that just little exaltation to each and for the families and they were they were were all blessed I'm standing with a a sister there I think she was in the hospital so went to went to redeem her also she cannot see and she cannot hear but we wanted to her to be there as we were speaking to her I said just come and sit on my side on my side so she was there there was a sister who was caring for her so it seems like she lost her hearing with when they were move they were moved out their their homes and uh she had some infection and she couldn't hear and she cannot see either so we have a few of those that remaining after that they had showing up their envelopes with uh some love offerings can go um probably just provide for themselves maybe for couple weeks maybe for a month of Provisions then then I flew back to kesta and then U uh rested for one day and Thursday flew back to to the us so we decided we had to I just want to show that we had two churches that for which we're providing for their needs this is the one so we are in the process for providing for this one little roof we can provide and whatever we could uh there and I will be keeping you up to date since it's a temporary we don't want to do something very big so um if they might go home we don't know how many how many months they're going to be there and then there's another little church in the kinas it's a open they just built a wall I don't know why they start with walls and they have uh uh pews and they even missing some we went there and most people were just standing up listening to the service so we have those two churches that we are going to be uh I'm just working with them to see uh what we can do with a little Charity with the remaining of the funds just to help them God bless you thanks for your your giving thanks for your prayers your love and support so those places we just feel led to go cuz there might be someone that never heard this message the the thing is in the Congo which is different from here you can go to a place you start sharing the gospel you can call somebody off the road do you have time to listen to me they can give you at least maybe three 3 minutes of their time they're not rushing like in here and you can even share and somebody would be thinking you know what I want to take your cont where where are you what is it about you can give him a reference go there's a church in the area go meet that that brother that Pastor and then so there is still an open field for uh evangelizing that's uh that's the the benefit the good side there they are humble people and uh we we are so fortunate that you are behind it and supporting with uh your prayers and your love and uh God bless you God bless you we might stand up and just read the scripture here brother Franco did Brother Franco did I miss on uh okay I got both of them thank you all right let's go we going to be taking a little thought here it's uh it's in a bit what I had Pro prepared seems like the Lord didn't allow me to to bring it but this morning he was I was just reading the Bible he just led me to some scriptures and I just want to us together looking into that as a as a little B Bible study here I know the Lord will use our pastor to shove it in I know yeah where I'm going to be limited God knows how to feed us and he's been doing it he's so faithful and he has he has an instrument here that uh whatever need I have he feeds me he provides for me and I know he does for you too I can say like David my heart is fixed our hearts are fixed here the word that he's providing for us here every time he meets our needs and he does more more than we can even anticipate yeah God bless you let's read it's going to be in the uh Genesis uh 22 Genesis chapter 22 we're going to be starting at verse one let me check the time I'm mindful of the time so 30 minutes or even less we should would be fine and it it goes and it came to pass after these things now these things are many things that happened prior to this moment here those things are when God spoke to Abraham when God showed him Visions when God came and visited Sarah when Abraham uh when he had a covenant with Abram just many things but then he goes and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold Here I Am the prophet of God said God doesn't does not tempt he tested Abraham and he said take now thy son thy own thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God has told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young man abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you let's have a word of prayer again precious Lord we just transitioning now from the report and father coming to the most crucial time lord of the day to know Lord read your word and hear from you would you come and in interpret your word father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may be seated I take a little thought here it's uh when Abraham's time to worship came it's uh I know that God changed AB Abram's name I know he when he was 75 years years old God met him God gave him a promise and then God worked with him through the the length of the the last the 25 of his life from the 75 when he was 100 experiences upon experiences in Genesis 17 that's when God renews his Covenant with Abraham by changing his name from Abram to Abraham and the prophet of God said this in uh in the message Abraham's Covenant confirmed preached in uh 1961 February 1061 he said and now we find out last night that it was Abram until God blessed him and made a covenant with him and then he changed his name from Abram to Abraham and ham was part of God's name did you notice that did it ever soak down in that's the prophet of God asking this now I'm saying what has to soak down in now about the name change he said Abram Elohim see he put part of God's name because God is a father of all and he made his name being Elohim God put part of his name with Abram see and made him a partner with him amen so that name God by renewing his Covenant with Abra Abram by changing his name from Abraham a from Abram to Abraham God did not openly tell Abraham what was happening Abram himself his name being changed to Abraham was to find out what was the meaning of that name of Abraham meaning God by giving him that name changing his name he was putting Abram into partnership with him amen gave him a blank check the prophet of God said he gave Abram a blank check now Abraham had to learn how to fill it out in the Abram's Covenant now preached in in MA in in March of 61 the prophet of God said that when he gave Abraham part of his name listen to that positionally he put his name on the check the same as he was so positionally God put Abra Abram's name on the check the same as God was Abraham had I'm let's go time is flying by let's go Abram had to find out later on that he was the body that Elohim lived in but he has to find it out he is Elohim that's the prophet of God saying Abram he said Abraham Elohim now he's saying he is Elohim Abram Abraham see gave him part of his own name a great Revelation there and you realize I could run that farther than that but the church now his taking Abraham coming bringing that to the church yes sir don't leave it up there 600 or 4,000 or 5,000 years ago with Abram now it's the church he says but the church when it ought to be taking strong meat is still drinking milk Abraham was doing the very same thing the name had been given changed Jehovah has given him his name nature he has brought Abram into partnership with him but Abraham was still drinking milk right so he gave his own name Abram and then when he did that the next thing he did after he gave him that name place that on his name then what did he do he he gave him a sign that he was ready to absolutely destroy all sin that was around him listen to the daunting task that Abraham had to be fully positioned in this partnership with God Abram had to grow from milk to meat and go Abram had to to do that and then he was ready God was made him ready to destroy all sin that was around him God was not going to destroy sin around Abram Abraham himself had the potential because his name was on the blank check Elohim Abraham Abraham Elohim so Abraham was to destroy all sin because he was the father of Faith amen faith has one motive faith in our lives has been given to us to destroy all sin amen all unbelief Amen in our in ourselves and position he put his body in condition to receive the promised son that he had waited on exactly what he's done to the church prise praise what God gave to Abraham to Abram by changing his name to Abraham he has done it with you and I amen yes sir we do not realize what the name bride means praise the bride the name bride means we are in partnership with God and he has given you and me that ability that I don't know how to call it the the power to destroy all sins that are surrounding us you will find out that after his name was changed in Genesis 17 in Genesis 18 we see the two god with two angels visiting Abraham after he has already changed his name and when he came to Abraham his wife his bride doubted and even denied her thoughts when uh God said that that she's behind me so the bride was the feminine form of Abraham though the masculine form of Abraham was higher in faith the feminine was still L lagging behind drinking milk in Genesis 19 I'm just going fast skipping some of lines here two angels visited lot in Genesis 19 to Sodom and God spared the life of lot by remembering Abraham the Bible said he did it in remembrance of Abraham that's how he saved the lot so meaning that I'm in partnership with him I cannot touch lot God even respected that Covenant amen because it meant so much to him in Genesis 19 so little Abraham realized that one of that one was one of the attributes of his new name to intercede for others so he was one of the attributes so that name was so big great that Abraham day by day had to he had to ponder what is entitled in this name within that name the intercession was in that name within that name Faith was there the the power to destroy all sin was there in that name even Genesis 20 we see that Abraham having his name changed still had not fully realized the content of it that's right all the all the all the value of it the worth of it and he he went lying to the king ABC that's right still with the name Abraham in partnership with God he was still growing that's right drinking milk but as we we move on God wanted Abraham to realize what was entitled in that name as we see that in Genesis 22 when we come to Genesis 22 if we flip back Genesis 21 TW uh um 21 verse 33 one of the those things it says and Abraham planted a Grove in bers Bersa and called there on the name of the Lord the Everlasting God and Abraham surgeon in the Philistines land many days although he had the name but he had not the full understanding of what that name means he even in 33: 33 he even called the name there when he he he had a covenant with the King aimc he was still dwelling in the Philistines land instead of being in his own land God had to teach him God had to let him grow to be able to come to understand that he had in himself the power to destroy all sin that was surrounding himself probably will may make it more clear Genesis 22 that's where God knew that God knew already that this is the time that Abraham is going to be selling himself completely out he's going to be understand the full extense of his name and then he's testing him and the testing came the testing was to offer him life Abraham's life didn't even mean too much but the life of Isaac it was the very Offspring The Very continuity of Abraham he was more valuable than Abram himself right now God is saying give me the very best that you got right offer it to me and as Abraham is going now 3 days journey I like how the prophet of God said that any man can walk between 15 20 or 25 miles per day he said that Abraham went for 3 Days walking to go to the mountain that uh where God showed him in a vision he said after he arrived there almost 75 miles he had walked God is showing him the mountain far off the prophet of God said maybe another 50 m off so he was over 100 miles off the civilization and during the three days something was happening in Abraham during the 3 days there was surely a confession in Abraham right that God I have not lived up to this name but now I have to completely sell out he sold completely out and he was willing willing to offer the very Offspring The Very life the very promise God said give me the only son you love he specified that the only son that you love which was Isaac and as Abraham is as um Genesis 225 is is going and Abraham said unto his young man abide ye here with the the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you all these years that God dealt with Abraham Abraham had might have had many experiences many shouting many singing but he never worshiped because worship required more than only singing required more than only shouting worship is always proceeded by offering the very best because we will find out that worship connects us back to our origin worship connects us back to our origin the prophet of God says we can even read it in the in um Genesis 4 about Cain and Abel the prophet of God is speaking about Cain and Abel he said they've been living for how many years a long time one was a tailer of the ground one was a shepherd and in the process of time they realized that they were dying now they wanted to find life they know that the east side was blocked by the cherubs they wanted to find life and then they decided to stop all that they were doing the tailor stopped the shepherd stopped now what should we do we need to find our origin we need to find life back because we're dying we're growing old can we connect back to the source of life and the prophet of God says this in the Victory Day preaching 1963 he said seeing that the two boys are trying to find favor with God to come back they wanted to come back to life they knew that they has stepped away death was setting in what was the how could we come back to life they wanted to come back they want to find the source they want to connect back to the source of life and the prophet says because they know that they were just fresh from The Garden of Life and they had they had fell on the other side by the transgression of their parents had made them subject to death just like we all stand this morning subjects to death and they wanted to know how to get back into that place where they could find life again that's the very first motive for the first two beings two sons on Earth Cain and Abel to find a way to worship when they went to Worship in reality they wanted to connect back to life they wanted to go back to find life again the prophet of God says this in the in in the glorified Jesus in 1955 he said now Cain I don't believe that Cain willfully walked out there and got the fruits of the fields works of of his hands and brought it over because he just absolutely wanted to do it to do it to be a smart alec Prophet didn't think he did that he said I believe Cain came with a full heart thinking he was doing right why was he trying to find favor with God worship is finding favor with God connecting back to your origin they wanted to connect back to life because death was setting in what was the way for us to connected back to God then let's worship let's find out God he was trying to find life again Cain he was trying to get back to the Garden of Eden again where the Cherub cherubims was I imagine they went to the east side where the cheram was guarding the Tree of Life they were trying to get back back the prophet of God is insisting they were trying to get back that's when you find the worship worship is when you are reconnecting back to your origin they were trying to get back and a man with the destination of his soul hanging in the balance he ain't going up there to play church that's right he's going up there to worship and with all his heart Cain said I believe there is a God and I'm coming to find favor with him the whole motive of Cain coming to worship both Abel and K coming to worship was to find life again was to connect back to where they were been run from and so he goes the prophet of God shows us the steps in in a worship Cain is going to be applying exactly the process in every worship that are required in every worship but he's doing it with without the Revelation from God he got all the mechanics correctly and listen to the mechanic the prophet of God says so he goes and gets the fruits of the field worship always requires an offering you cannot worship without offering that's the reason the prophet of God said worship uh giving is a central part of our worship he said so he goes and gets the fruits of the fields that he had raised and brought them up and laid them down that was his offering he was bringing perhaps uh put big CA lies and beautiful flowers around and stepped back oh we could have something to say here of that nature like that but he stepped back knelt down and raised raise up his hands Cain is after bringing his offering he's going to be confessing he knew the process in to come to a complete worship that after I bring my offering I have to confess Cain confessed his wrong but he did it without the Revelation with the knowledge he had he was following the mechanical steps that were required in worship he confessed his wrong first he brought his offering the fruits then he confessed his wrong and worshiped Jehovah he knew that I have to do these two things first before I can worship to complete my worship I have to bring an offering I have to confess can did those when sometimes us messy Believers we have hard time to confess how about even bringing an offering even being regular in tithing but Cain knew better and did it but Jehovah shook his head and said no because he did it his own way the mechanic was perfect but he did it his own way Abel did the very same thing but he had the Revelation he brought what was required and the prophet of God said that Cain in the same message Cain offered a beautiful sacrifice of flowers and fruits of the field or whatever it was he put on the was he put on the altar but Able by spiritual Revelation revealed to him that he was not the fruit he had to bring something to an offering and God knew that he has to bring something to complete his worship he gave him the Revelation to pick up the right offering it was the blood that caused the death so he offered back blood and of an innocent substitute and God God accepted it we're looking at uh time is a looking at The Prodigal Son can just take take one example in Luke 15 we can read it together if you want or I can read it Luke 15 verse 11 now we know that the prodigal son had stepped away had cut his way off from the father now as he came to himself he also wanted to connect back to his father he knew that the way to connect back to my father is to worship I have to find My Worship my way back is a worship so Luke 15:11 said and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that uh fth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his young journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with a righteous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed sowing we can go back to 17 step down to 17 and when he came to himself this is when the Revelation is coming back to him because he was living in the dark world as we did there's only one thing that can bring life and light into our life that's the message the revelation of the hour he got the revelation of his hour and he came back to himself he said how many hired Servants of my father have bread enough to spare and I perish in hunger he was questioning after the Revelation struck him he came to himself now he's thinking the right thoughts there's only the revelation of your hour that can give you the right thoughts outside of the revelation you will not even know will never even come to yourself so he came to himself you will see him he's going to be processing using the same mechanism the same mechanics that was in Genesis he has he knew that for me to connect back to my father this is a worship I need to bring something I need to confess then I will find my worship then I will connect back to my father 17 says 18 he's prep preparing his offering now I I will arise and go to my father who is the offering here himself he didn't want to take anything he knew that this this worship this connection does not need any material thing it needs an offering a special offering amen because this offering is going to complete my worship I've been out cut off from Life cut off from my connection cut off from my source there's only one thing that I can bring into worship that will connect me back to the source I will arise and go I myself am that offering walking on two [Music] feet to my father I'm not bringing flow fruits I'm not bringing flowers I am the very offering that's needed to complete this connection I'm the only offering that needs to reconnect back to go into worship and will say unto him father he doing can did it too I have sinned against heaven and before thee he's confessing right 19 and am no more worthy when he understood that he is no longer in the picture prise God he has no worth himself father what you say that's who I am whatever your word says that's what I will do Abraham had to learn that he did not know until Genesis 22 when he knew that God in this Abram name it's you doing I have no nothing to to hinder or to do whatever you say that's what I will do am remember that in Genesis 21 he was Grievous after Isaac was born and then Ishmael mocking Sarah Sarah said cast out the Bond woman and the the the son and his and her son Abram was Grievous it bothered him a lot although in partnership with God still some little thing was around him some doubt some resistance was still around Abraham but in Genesis 22 he had nothing holding him Genesis 22 he knew that this name it's not me in action it's God himself living his word in this body whatever he says that's what I do and then the The Prodigal Son came at the place that he knew that he was no longer to be in the picture true a true worship you and I are no longer in the picture it's the word of the father living out his own life in our being Genesis 22 it was Abraham completely not worthy that God your will is my will the prodigal son said and I'm no more worthy to be called the son make me as one of thy hired servant so that's where he found a true worship because he connected back to the father and what did the father do the father adopted him sir he adopted him that's rightall we could go into and the prophet of God says that even when the Magi the wise men when they went to they followed the star to see the young child born they went to worship him but before they could worship Him the Bible said that they came to worship and then they opened up the treasures amen a worship a true worship requires an offering a confession then you can find the connection back to the origin so to to complete our worship unto him we must be completely sold out to give him the best there is and I don't know any better than yourself and myself let us stand kids go to school tomorrow let me read this as we're standing up in the message behold the greater than Solomon is here preached 1962 the prophet of God says you all know the form of a pagan worship this is about worship now the prophet of God is going to be telling us how Pagan worship is being done and how God's worship is being proceeded he said so now a Pagan worship way they do they bring the idol and set it up and then they get a priest and they bless the candle and they put this candle before the idol his musicians might be coming and they bring him something to eat he's telling us how the the the Pagan are doing they bring an idol and set it up might be a statue and then they get a priest and they bless the candle they put this candle before the idol and they bring him something to eat there's Al always an offering there for a worship they bring him something to eat and eat communion with him and then they prostrate themselves before that Idol and just give in their mind in such a way till they believe believe that they can hear that Idol speak back to them they believe they're presuming that that they can hear the idol speak to them now that's Pagan idol worship now that's contrary to god let's listen to our worship Sons and Daughters of God's worship see God is not an idol God is a spirit and we prostrate ourselves before that and the spirit doesn't come into some Idol as so as some so-called Christians would have us to believe but the spirit comes into you and you are God's house living amen amen when the prodal son went back the very life the very will of the father was living in him amen he was the house of his own father his body the body of a prodigal son became the very House of the will of his father that's when he found the true worship amen so the prophet of God said and you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for God dwells not in temples made with hands but a body has thou prepared me you are God's letter when you find your Worship in God you become his letter amen amen a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through if you could prostrate yourself before God and say God I am a sinner God come into me and then the Holy Spirit comes in and then you are a living Idol of God living representative of God walking around with God speaking through your lips to others the woman of the world had the same thing when Jesus met her the only thing after telling her that you have five husband the sixth one is not yours she said you are you are um a prophet but her question was she wanted to connect back to deity she had a a question on worship that's the reason Jesus came and asked her give me water yes Jesus wanted fresh water amen fresh water not denomination GED the very life the very body that he can express his world through amen and she gave that water at the end as the prophet of God said David wanted fresh water amen that was Christ Christ wants fresh water from you tonight find your Worship in him tonight and we can only do it by bringing him an offering what offering are you bringing him tonight he can have nothing else but yourself and myself bring yourself to him tonight and confess sir and then you will be a living epistle because he wants his life to be expressed through you am God bless you so let's bow our heads as a musician might play something precious Lord we we just want to thank you again father with uh this time you have given us little broken thoughts here Lord but that's all you gave me for today I have no idea what you would do with it but one thing I know that anything given in your hand Lord you will know how to dispatch it we just give our beings to you is a a offering Lord we want to worship Abraham could not worship all those years the only time he could find a complete worship is when Abraham's will lived no more when he was completely surrendered and sold out to your will that whatever you say was father an amen to him and father tonight all of us together we are children unto you might have had many many experiences the times we might have shouted times we might have prayed times we might have sung in the spirit but Lord we want a complete worship we want to fully connect back to life fully connected to you and for that we're bringing ourselves as an offering tonight and we confessing our mistakes and shortcoming and say Lord we have resisted you in any shape in any area of Our Lives father tonight is the very night that lord it's all in your hands I just want to be a tool that father you can use you can have your full partnership with me meaning your spirit needing a body and we are those bodies father we're giving them to you that you will take full preeminence we know Lord Jesus that you have had the three-fold purpose the first was to have preeminence in your son that's when he became a complete offering to you the second one you willing to have preeminence in your bride and father in The Bride will give you it its complete being that you will be you will have full preeminence that we can return back to Eden we love you tonight father bless your children and all that we desire is that your perfect will be done that you will have your way in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Amen brother Chad you can come as repl something Brothers I want to do thy will oh Lord Oh I want to do thy will oh Lord just take me break me m me and make I want to do thy will oh Lord sing it one more time oh I want to do th will oh Lord oh I I want to do thy [Laughter] will take me break me mour me and make me I want to do [Music] th praise God Amen I want to give myself a fresh amen and oh I want to come if I could come like the prodical son and come to myself that was our story amen and if you're here and that's not your story it can be your story amen that under the revelation of the hour we can come to ourselves and recognize who our father is and what how far we are away from our father's house and then go back humble amen the Way Up Is Down he come back humbled and submissive with an offering of himself but not with pride and arrogancy but he came back just wanting to take the place of a servant amen but the father brings the best robe and the ring and puts it on his finger why he accepted his sacrifice and accepted his worship and brought him into his position as a son oh what a lesson today man I thank God I don't know what he had on his mind before but this little bit ended up being a whole morsel full for me amen I thought it was wonderful and I thank God for it amen what does God want worship how do I worship him first I've got to bring the right sacrifice and in the God showed us what's that sacrifice it's none other than myself to surrender everything all my ideas like Abraham he finally got to the place where he wasn't protecting himself he wasn't trying to have any other way what God Said is the way it was going to be he offered everything the best of everything I just want to offer myself that way and I want to come back with an offering and I want to come back with humility I want to come back with a confession Lord I'm nothing I've never made it right I've never done anything right but I want to give myself to you so that you can come in and do right through me man what an opportunity we have in this day to connect back to our father oh God the whole purpose of worship oh it was simple it was short but it was deep and profound has so much meaning for me it's my desires is what God's offered us in the message this is what the message is doing it's reconnecting us back through true worship back to life again it's exactly what's available today friends so thankful for that I thank God for his word and may we each be encouraged to continue to just Worship in spirit and in truth and I'm so thankful for what God's done through our brother Emanuel I remember a couple years ago when he had this desire just to do something that he had as a boy just to do something to help and I've watched we've all watched his God directed it from one step to the next to the next and how mightily God's using our brother by doing what just simply going the way he feels LED and let God figure it all out amen it's been wonderful to watch and I appreciate you brother Emanuel God bless you very much and I'm also thankful that he got put up in the five-star hotel amen because when brother Emanuel told me that he was he was a little bit bashful about it he said I I never spend money on that kind of Hotel I would have bought a cheaper one and use the funds for something else and but you know I know the brother left here with a cough he left here coughing with a bit of a cold and and and he was struggling and preaching and with the dust and the atmosphere and and you know what God knew his servant needed he needed to sleep well and have a good shower and clean sheets and something to eat because he wasn't there for himself he was there for God's people serving God's purpose so I believe God provided him a good hotel and the truth is it was the cheapest place he ever stayed in his life but I'm thankful that God provided it for our brother amen amen I believe it was fitting I thank God Amen may God just continue to use us as he used our brother may he use me may I have the sensitivity just to go the way he leads me and just trust him and just step out by faith man it's been a good lesson for us all amen let's just bow our heads and thank God for this service Lord Jesus we thank you for the the service today thank you for the word that you've shared with us God you've connected us back to yourself by giving us a revelation that brings us into true worship a worship that can be accepted by you we're not here Lord to bring you Lord Creeds or dogmas or ideas but God you've called us bride so that we could have faith to take you at your word and to give ourselves to you as a sacrifice to give up Lord every ambition and dream scheme whatever it was Lord that we can surrender it all and come to you and give you the very best go on that we can confess Lord that without this message we have nothing we know nothing we are nothing we couldn't find our way we couldn't do anything right we were just as miserable as the prodical son going his own way he had lost everything by following his own lust and his own passions and his own thoughts and his own schemes he had lost it all and we as a human beings have done the same thing but God you have brought us to ourselves through this message and Awakening and recognition that we have a father God we come back to confess to you Lord that we have failed you we have failed in every way that human beings can fail but oh God we just want to come back to you and we're willing to come back just as servants Lord just just take us back God we know according to the message that you're bringing us back to our position as Sons and Daughters God we want to give you that true worship Lord we ask also for a special blessing for our brother Manuel that you just strengthen him

all the the the things that you've put in his hand to do may he have your wisdom in doing it all Lord God that he would just be directed by your spirit and he would go as he felt led and that you would direct him and provide for him and help us as a church to know how to support him and and care for him and pray for him and and give him financial means Lord and just continually bless him and use him we pray God we want to give ourselves to you the same way we've watched our brother give himself to you we want to be used by you too in whatever way you can use us for we've seen a living example in this pull pit today Lord a man who will surrender and give to you himself as the best offering and how now you're living through him to meet the needs of others and to preach the gospel God we want to do the same thing we want to come in true worship to connect back to our father and offer ourselves to you as servants so that you can take us in places as Sons so that you can live inside
