[0:00] so when abel comes to bring his offering
[0:05] this is not
[0:07] uh
[0:08] this is not
[0:09] if i could say it this way this is not
[0:12] reading on a piece of paper you must
[0:14] offer a lamb and then giving a lamb
[0:19] but this is catching something from the
[0:21] mind of god that has to do with why he
[0:24] must make an offering to begin with
[0:27] why he is outside of the garden
[0:31] why he is wearing animal skins
[0:35] to cover his naked see it's so much more
[0:38] than just take a lamin off for a lamb
[0:40] he's caught by a revelation a divine
[0:43] revelation so much more than slay this
[0:46] lamb he now knows why he's outside of
[0:48] the garden he now knows why he must make
[0:51] a sacrifice he now knows why he's
[0:53] wearing a garment of animal skins
[0:57] cain has no idea why he's outside of the
[0:59] garden why he must bring a sacrifice and
[1:02] why he's wearing a garment of animal
[1:03] skins
[1:05] so in this hour amen the message is not
[1:08] a see and repeat message amen it is not
[1:12] i see and i do and that brother's right
[1:14] i'll do like him and i'll be right amen
[1:17] it is not that we worship by revelation
[1:20] amen god has revealed to us his plan
[1:23] from before the foundation the world
[1:25] what was in the back part of god's mind
[1:27] amen before amen that the world was ever
[1:29] created and we're worshiping christ by
[1:32] the revelation of christ in this hour
[1:34] not monkey see monkey do repeat after me
[1:38] this is the form and this is the ritual
[1:40] this is how we do it in the message that
[1:42] is not acceptable to god he's not
[1:45] punctuating that he's punctuating and
[1:48] vindicating what he revealed
[1:51] and when we worship by revelation it's
[1:54] vindicated and punctuated that that's
[1:56] right
