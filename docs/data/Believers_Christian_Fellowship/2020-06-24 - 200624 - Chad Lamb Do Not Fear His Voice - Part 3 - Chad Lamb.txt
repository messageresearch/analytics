========================================

it seems like things are bleaker every day but for the child of god it makes no difference things are going to get better either way i have never been more thrilled about tomorrow sunshine's always all the bad news it seems like things are bleaker every day but for the child of god it makes no difference things are going to get better either way i have never been more thrilled about tomorrow sunshine's always bursting through the clouds i just feel like something good is about to happen and brother this could be that very day oh i just feel like something good and is could be that very day amen let's give my handoff of praise tonight amen [Music] [Music] all things [Music] [Music] lord i believe lord r [Music] things are possible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] received lord [Music] [Applause] lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord did you come to receive from him today come to worship the lord praise his holy name oh god bless you it's good to be here this evening while we're standing let's just take our bibles and read together out of second corinthians 2 corinthians chapter 3. this is uh we're going to continue on with the same thought this would be part three of do not hear do not fear his voice and i'm gonna maybe do just a little bit of review we're gonna read a couple of the same quotes go through the same scripture and then move forward i didn't didn't expect to continue on this far in this subject but it just keeps opening and opening and that's the way we like it amen we like it when he does it different than what we expected amen and so let's look at second corinthians 3 and 12. seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look could not step fast they look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty so what is true liberty when the veil of the heart is taken away we've come into christ in the veil of misunderstanding the veil of darkness of of denominational understanding traditional understanding when the veil is taken away that is real liberty because it frees us to be who we've always been intended to be so that's true liberty now verse 18 but we all with open face that means unveiled face but we all with open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord and let us bow our heads and read i pray lord jesus we thank you for what you've done for us lord and we're looking forward to what you will do lord and we've come tonight with great expectation in our hearts just to feed from your hand we pray lord that you would break the bread of life to us lord this evening that you would speak through these lips of clay your eternal words and help us lord to perceive all that it is you're trying to speak to us in this hour that we might live this word that you're giving to us we ask that you would find welcome in this place that you would take preeminence and you would be glorified in all we say in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated now if we look at this last verse here it says but we all with open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so now we need this open face we need this unveiled face for the for the veil to be taken away so that we can behold him amen and see him as he is so now you can see how important it was for the opening of the seals because those seals were christ and it was sealed up and sealed up the book and the book was christ as the revelation jesus christ so you can see how that veil had to be rent amen in the veil of our heart has to be rent so the veil on christ on the bible by tradition has to be rent the veil in our heart has to be read so that we can see him face to face and if we can see him face to face then we are changed into the same image that we're beholding and so that's why it's so important that we're looking at the right thing because if we're not looking at an open book we can never be changed into the image of the seventh seal we can never be changed into the image of christ if christ is still veiled so it had to take a prophet coming in this day christ himself came through a prophet to take the seals off the book to open the book to unveil the book to take the veil or the covering off of the book so that we could see christ amen and then by the spirit take the veil off of our heart so we can behold him face to face so that we can become what we're seeing so we we realized that god had to do this work and why did god do this work so that we could become what we're beholding brother brahman says in the unveiling of god from 1964 the veil has been lifted off the word that's right it's revealed to babes it's lifted they see it and will be that's right then it will be as once said when you see when this veil is take off the word the traditions is taken off the word as jesus once said when you see me you see the father oh boy that just took on a whole new meeting didn't it when you see me you see the father amen because they're one and the same but you have to see him when the veil of tradition is taken off of the word you see him and when you see him you see the father amen and god and his word is one now you understand amen i pray that we understand more and more and more let's turn to the book of galatians and look at galatians chapter four together galatians chapter 4 and verse 19. paul the apostle speaking in and he makes this statement in chapter 4 verse 19 my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you so paul was going through birth pains he was trying to bring forth something and so he was laboring again in travail travail is in birth and he he's travailing again through another birth pain with the galatians and what's he trying to do he's travailing in birth until christ be formed in you so what was the goal of paul's ministry what was paul trying to do he was laboring in birth trying to bring forth christ but how would he bring forth christ when christ was formed in the church amen that's what he was laboring to bring forth christ formed in you amen now you see how paul laid a cornerstone brother branham would bring the capstone of the same thing do we understand now brother branham he he he may not he may not be quoting scripture when he's preaching but he's always preaching the scriptures so don't don't ever be mistaken when brother bam says something no matter how odd it sounds and no matter how it sounds like i've never heard this statement before i've never heard it this way you rest assured he's always preaching the scriptures and he may be phrasing in a way you've never heard a phrase or using an application that you never thought it used but he's always preaching the scriptures and paul was travailing in birth until what until christ be formed in you amen and we know that the church had gone through seven church ages to come back to the same spot where finally christ is going to be be formed in the bride and it will be the it'll be it'll be the bride coming of christ or jesus christ coming in the formation of the bride christ formed in you the same thing paul was preaching praise be to god so i want to go back through this quote proving his word we read this last time it's lengthy but i'm going to take my time and read it so we can fully grasp it it says now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts of sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh now brother brahm didn't say it wasn't christ he said it wasn't jesus because jesus hadn't been born yet do you understand it's been the same thing all the way through christ the word made manifest christ the word made manifest christ the word made manifest amen but that that christ was going to get a name when he took on an earthly vessel and when all of that was poured into one earthly vessel that vessel was given a name and earthly name of jesus amen that's why now all the family in heaven and earth is named jesus all right and that becomes the name of god when god took on flesh he took on a name and that became his name and now just like when the woman in the garden of eden her name was adam right her name was adam she didn't have her own name amen and christ was god didn't have his own name all the redemptive names of jehovah of jehovah the old testament is jesus christ of the new testament so all those titles was christ what god was called christ was called it's the same thing do you understand but then that woman after that woman fell she was given a name eve and so now we use that name eve retroactively you see what i'm saying so you say in the cool of the evening when god came down he spoke to adam and eve at that time he didn't he spoke to adam male and female you understand but now after she's got a name we attach that name to the dispensation all the way back and say that was adam and eve and there's nothing wrong with saying that but you realize at that point back here she didn't yet have a name that's what brother branham is saying not that it's a different person once we get the name amen jesus christ now we we retroactively put it all the way back and that's why brother branham said if you if if you read every verse of your bible and don't see christ go and read it again and we know who that is and what his name is amen but it was a man in human flesh abraham called elohim the great almighty and jesus says as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so brother baby said as it was back then so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is revealed this is the coming of the lord at luke 17 30 when the son of man is being revealed and so he says not no more as church see not no more it's not the denominational system it's not the church anymore not no more church but the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together hey amen so what was the point of the forerunner ministry when when the son of man would come down in human flesh the point of the ministry was to unite the two together and if we miss the uniting of the two together we miss the point of the ministry amen amen the church is to be the so he says the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what i mean it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage amen it skips down he says but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing now this is a really important quote because we realize that at the coming of the son of man you have the revealing of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man comes through a prophet amen that god comes down in human flesh and so makes the word real and live that it unites the two together because that's the purpose of the eliezer ministry is is to fetch a bride for isaac to unite the two together and that was the purpose but what was it to do it does that to do what to produce the son of man again so that we can't just take the son of man ministry and just put it on brother branham only because it came in brother branham so that we can make the word live and real to unite the headship to the body so that they could unite in an invisible marriage union so that it can produce the son of man again when the church and the word becomes one amen this is so important because with without without this understanding we put everything back on brother branham and totally rest in the fact that he fulfilled his portion and then it makes us feel good because we saw brother branham come out of the scriptures and fulfill his part of the word and i believe that so i'm fine but that's just the first step that's the step that comes to show the word to unite you with the headship so that now you become the expression of the word and we can't leave it back there with brother branham he did his part but that can't bring us satisfaction knowing that he kept all the word assigned to him that doesn't make us okay that came and he manifests that to unite us with christ so that now the son of man amen so it can produce the son of man again so that same life that was producing through brother branham is the same life that must be manifesting through the bride and if that's not happening leaning on the arm of brother branham or standing in the shadow of that prophet will not do any good because the purpose of that manifestation was to get you united to christ so that you you yourself as an individual and the word become one thing so that you become the living word for your generation that's a mouthful but it's the truth amen so so we get sometimes we sometimes we can get hung up in the wrong dispensation and we don't want to get hung up in the wrong dispensation because to be hung up in the wrong dispensation does not equal life it equals death do we understand what i'm saying praise be to god so just still reviewing just a little bit i want to read another two quotes and review and then move forward brother branham in the later scene church age from the church age books as a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word so we like we said sunday the lutheran spoke for god so when you heard the lutheran's message you were hearing from god so to reject that message amen amen they could no when they went to creed and dogma they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the method has failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until the last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is his own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age oh praise be to god huge statement friends huge statement but once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost so when when when god when jesus christ returned to the church in the form of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost and broke himself up and put himself into flesh that's what was taking place at pentecost amen and they spilled out prophesying amen it wasn't it wasn't the fact that they were speaking in tongues that made him hear from god it was the fact that they were speaking the prophecy come alive in their day was them speaking for god that was the voice of god when they took the word when when peter took the word of joel and said this is that they were hearing from god and so so they heard direct from god as at pentecost when now the spirit of god was dwelling in a mini-membered body and they were giving out the word for that day they were hearing direct from god and he said once more the world were here for direct from god as at pentecost at pentecost was not a one-man ministry at pentecost was the life of jesus christ in his people and that is how the world will once more hear direct from god is at pentecost when god is now who was bottled and confronted jesus bottled and confined in jesus christ is now bottled and confined in his bride see see we get into trouble sometimes when we don't fully realize what's going on because we have a hard time sometimes grasping the gravity of the statements that brother brennan made because we when we talk about it in a general sense we understand it it's true but when we talk about it in a personal individual sense it seems too wonderful for me it seems too great to be possible be gone beyond realization beyond how how can this be and so we begin to let down in the revelation when we stop talking general and start talking specific and individual we start backing off of this instead when i say we all do it every one of us do it but we've got to come to the realization like brother bannon did he come to the point where he he knew what his ministry was and what part he was playing and wrought role he was playing amen in the opening of the seals that solidified the role that he was playing and he knew his position in the scriptures and he had to stand in that position so now we've got to come to the same revelation by the opening of the seals to us is what is our position who am i now stop saying who are we because this isn't the day of we the day of we died at the end of the laodicean church amen now we've moved into the bride age and it's not the day of we this is the day of who am i and if i could catch a revelation from the word of god of who i am and stay in that position there's power that comes from being in your god-given position but we fail so many times to manifest the power of god because we're so hit-and-miss on our position we're so one day in and one day out and someday i feel like it possibly could be and the next day i'm wondering if it could possibly be and we wonder why we don't have the overcoming power in our lives is because we've never settled down to take god at his word as he reveals it in our heart we keep dropping back to emotions and mental thinking we keep dropping back to how could it be possible i know my faults and i know my mistakes he chose you before you ever made a mistake and it's not tied and hinged to your mistakes it's tied to the will of god the purpose that was in him before the foundation of the world then if he can drop the revelation of your in your heart that you were there and you'll return there it doesn't matter the weaknesses the frailty it doesn't matter the inabilities we've got to stop looking through mental eyes at a natural condition and get back to looking at the revelation of his word and the word only but we still in our own personal lives are mixing the word of god with our intelligence and putting it together and bringing a hybrid life and we struggle to overcome and struggle to overcome and struggle to overcome it's because we're still hybrid in our thinking one day i take the word of god the next day i look at my condition until until we can take god at his word day in and day out day in and day out just take him out of his word let god be god let god sort it out let god figure it out let his power overcome i can't do it i never could do it i'll never be able to do it but i just take what he says and i say it's true and if you call me your virgin bride then that's what i am if you call me bright i'm bride amen i can't help it amen it's the title he gave me it's not the title i gave myself yes how do you know because a prophet come in the first seal and he said i no longer call you church i call you bride so that you understand and then you say well you know god is i know that applies to me because i believe what that man was saying i know who he is and i know he was talking to and when he come to the first seal he was speaking to me and i don't know if there's another person on the planet that those seals came for but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that those seals came for me and that prophet is speaking directly to me to unlock the mystery inside of me so when he says i no longer call you church i call you bride i can say amen because i'm not reading that book for other people i'm reading that book for me [Music] and if if we can accept everything else the prophet says we can accept what he says about himself we can accept what he says about the future we can accept what he says about genesis we can accept everything that prophet said then what a disservice we do to that prophet when we can't accept what he said about you praise god god's going to have a mighty army that's raised up and operating by the word and the word only because the day that you feel miserable terrible wretched and no good you're still a son or daughter of god called to be the manifestation of the word in this day nothing changed in the mind of god the only thing that changed changing your spirit realm and your mind but nothing changed in god and we become fickle in our lives and inconsistent because we allow the hybridization of human thinking in the word to come together amen help us god to kill reasoning to cast down reasoning in every thought that exalted self against the knowledge of god and come to terms with what god said about us amen i'll tell you this just i know how it works because i've lived in flesh all my life i said on my earthly journey i'll say you could sit here and hear me preaching that and still still say but it might be for others it may not be for me if that's what you want to confess that's the exact level that you'll live and never go above that you'll never go above that level because you always have an uncertainty about my predestination election and you you nev and you think you're being practical and you think you're being honest and you're limiting the expression of christ in your life i want to ask you this what would be wrong at taking god at his word and saying what a prophet said every day of your life to your dying breath and not be bright what would be wrong with that how would you be how would you be judged by taking a prophet exactly what he said believing it for you even if it's not for you claiming that you're the bride living the word everything the prophet said living it doing it surrendering your life to the lord and at the end of the journey find out you really weren't bribed do you think it's still going to go wrong for you at the white throne judgment if that's the attitude you took so why are we so afraid to confess the word what are the consequences well i might be deceived you're deceived in living the word that's a good deception you're surrendering your life to the word living the word accepting the message and well i might be deceit i might just be kidding myself hey keep kidding yourself there's nothing else that brings life there's nothing else that'll bring a manifestation there's nothing else to live for on this planet so just kill reasoning kill the devil amen just cast it down and say i'm not going to think that way anymore i won't accept that line of thinking if that if god sent that prophet to me and he brought me to this message i'll take everything that prophet said everything that's laying in the word about me and i'll just say it i'll just confess it and if something in my heart raises up i'll cast it out in the name of the lord praise be to god the devil's trying to kill us with our own wrong thinking injecting thoughts we can't accept it amen continue on the latest in church age from the church age book brother brad says oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride the voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later so now we have to know what dispensation we're in and we have to know where we're at because the dispensation of malachi 4 has already came he's already manifested what he's supposed to manifest he can't manifest anything more now i don't say that manifestation doesn't still have an effect because it's that voice that woke up the seed inside of me and it's still that voice is still going on this is still the day of the voice amen that's still essential that is still an essential part amen to calling the bride so it's not going away it's not dead but he can do no more than what he's already done amen now it's time for the bride to manifest brother bennett says in the pergament church age out of the church age book he says have you noticed in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bright say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit oh this is a good quote i like it in every church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true christians took the word for their age what is your age what word do you take for this age not a pentecostal word this is time for bright age so we have to take the word for our age did you get that last thought i repeat every church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual hear what the spirit saith to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each ace has had its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them what did they do to prove they had deceit in them well they had to speak with tongues and they had to work at least one miracle in their life they had to see at least some manifestations and if they saw a few spiritual manifestations they proved they had seed see what the old pentecostal doctrine has done to try to ruin the truth of this day cause us to doubt what god has given us because we don't see certain manifestations we don't see certain demonstrations but this is not what brother branham taught let's read it again just so you can get it honed down tight the spirit gives the word how does he give it through a messenger spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them because they heard what the spirit spoke through the messenger of that day amen and they received that word proving they had the spirit and the seed inside of them what seed is that that's the eternal seed gene of god john 8 47 and he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god they refused the word jesus and his words for their day but the true seed received the word because they were of god isaiah 54 13 and all thy children shall be taught of god holy spirit jesus said the same thing in john 6 45 being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit-filled no other criterion do you understand that let's read that no other criterion being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled spirit-filled sometimes our interpretation of what it means to be spirit-filled is a hangover from the pentecostal age but proving that you're of god and spirit-filled means you become one with the word you hear it you receive it proving the seed is in you i love it when the prophet breaks it down and takes the scarecrow away and takes the worry and the scare away amen praise be to god just keep moving in the message god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same it's important to note where brother brandon preaches this message he preaches this message at the beginning of the seal series so he's coming sunday morning to start the seals and he starts with a church dedication and it's not a dedication it's actually a rededication because they just expanded their sanctuary they just got it done in time for the meetings he's rededicating the tabernacle and he's rededicating ourselves and then he preaches god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same then that night he preaches the breach and then he goes through the seals so so this is an important message let's just say it that way he placed it here for a reason and brother baby goes on to say the fruit of the spirit is by their fruits not tongues or emotions but by their fruit you shall know them then it's all said oh now you got me because i can't always be nice i can't always go without making a mistake oh now brother chad see see i knew there was a catch i knew i couldn't be it let's just keep reading by their fruits not tongues or emotions but by their fruits you shall know them so that is the fruit of the spirit it's god unfolding himself in humility sweetness and every day the same it's something about a man that stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates it with an amen no matter what the other people say what was that the fruit of the spirit not a motion not a workup not certain manifestations but the fruit of the spirit is when the man hears the word of god he punctuates it with an amen no matter what anybody else says that's the fruit of the spirit according to the prophet of god i like it 1965 god's chosen place of worship god has a certain place he met he met abraham and there abraham worshiped all down through the testament and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him he didn't say the promise were to be interpreted to you his promise would be interpreted in you this is important because what's the promise for today what's our age it's a bride age that we've been caught up into amen caught out of the church ages called up out of laodicea into the bride age amen so now amen let's read this again he says the word that he promised i'm sorry and he and his promised word will be interpreted in you not to you because this word that he will have a bride that he will be known in the formation of the bride he will be in the bright form amen the bride coming from christ all these terms that we have that's not something to be interpreted to you but that is something to be interpreted in you because if there's going to be a bride coming of christ there has to be a demonstration of christ in a bride form that's why the word cannot be interpreted to you the word must be interpreted in you that makes you living your life for christ you surrendering to the word you going through trials and tribulations but staying true to that word and honoring god and believing him at all costs what is that that becomes the interpretation of the word for this day manifesting right through your life that's why the word will be interpreted in you not to you praise be to god and i'll read that sentence again in his promised word will be interpreted in you by him did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you will be a written epistle of god read of all man did you get it a written epistle read of all men what are they supposed to read they're supposed to read christ in the form of the bride christ in his people christ and his bride the bride manifesting christ which is the word for this day praise be to god you become written you will be a written epistle of god read of all men not what you claim but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim god said these signs shall follow them that believe that speaks through you he spoke of this age what would we what what would be now the believers of this age has to believe this oh listen he spoke of this age brother burns in 1965 god's chosen place of worship he spoke of this age what would be now the believers of this age has to believe this what he promised today just the same as they had to come into the ark to be saved go out of egypt to be saved they have to come into christ to be saved now into the word message just like going into the ark just like coming out of egypt you have to come into christ the word message to believe the word for this day that's that that he's the same yesterday today and forever in the message things that are to be this is right at the end of his ministry last few weeks of his life on this earth now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is the word bride this is the last quote we let read sunday and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living you know what brother branham you know what he excluded from the manifestation of this hour he excluded malachi 4. because the purpose of malachi 4 the purpose of the revealing of the son of man was to unite the head to the body so that you could have christ in the formation of the bride that will be the word expressed for this hour this is the message this is what he said i'll read it again and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creator denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living and that had a forerunner what i just read had a forerunner and what did he forerun he referred the second coming of christ the coming of the son of man in the revealing of the son of man to do what to unite the head and the body to do what to produce the son of man again so that had a forerunner and that forerunner come and did his job as eleazar professor bride for christ united the two the forerunner went off the scene because the manifestation of this hour is not the forerunner the manifestation of this hour is the bride christ in the bride not your flesh not this church not the people sitting here that's not the manifestation the manifestation is jesus christ the word that word alive in you behind the veil of your flesh that's the manifestation in this hour praise be to god hey amen god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself to saying remember brother branham is starting with this message when he's going into the seals he says notice elijah's day god chose to hide himself in a simple person and i'm just pulling some excerpts out of this god chose to hide himself in a simple person who was hiding where god was hiding in elijah why do you think brother brennan is preaching this in god in simplicity we're going to put our spiritual jackets on and say i'm tuned in i'm catching what the prophet's saying i understand when he says elijah montana's go up okay and so god elijah was a simple person brother said a man of the woods and uh uneducated who's he talking about elijah's day god chose to hide himself in a simple person guess what we come back to elijah's day and brother was showing that it's god in simplicity he said but a simple man no education might have made it to the seventh grade i don't know we have no place where he ever went to school we have nothing about him just a simple man but god was pleased to hide in that simple person god back there with this simple man hiding in a human being can you grasp it god hiding an illiterate crack to the world who's brother branham really talking about he's not really talking about elijah back there he's really using that to show you his own ministry the elijah ministry in that day an uneducated person a crank to the world amen and where's god hiding he's hiding behind the veil of that man who is he's going to minister amen the elijah ministry through further down he says now and god hid himself in there in such simplicity further down he says now you see while i was in the simple way and everybody everybody against him everybody was at his throat all the ministerial association and everything else was at his throat that's true trying to get rid of him everything else but in that simplicity even though they had no cooperation with his campaigns and what when did elijah have campaigns and cooperation do you understand what he's trying to show us they had no cooperation with his campaigns and whatever more they had everybody thought he was a crank god was hiding himself because brother branham comes and and i said this sunday but i want to reiterate brother branham becomes the mystery of the seventh seal on display when he turns back to the audience what was that that was the seventh seal hiding behind flesh in simplicity that was christ he said you know it's not me it's him i didn't do those things he did those things where is he at he's inside this human vessel displaying the seventh seal and he becomes the mystery of what's written in the white rock that the light has never shown on this and now it's hidden behind his veil and is being demonstrated out so that it can catch individuals out there who can have the their heart veil written opened up now he goes further down in this message god hiding himself in simplicity he says god hides himself in a simple little wash woman or an ordinary man with his dinner under his arm kiss his wife and children goodbye and go out there and maybe hide himself in that man to do something that an archbishop would know nothing about now brother bam took it out of elijah and out of himself and he put it right in you if it could be in a washer woman if it could be in a man with a lunch pail under his arm kiss his wife and his babies and go out there what is it it's god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same and then hiding why in the simplicity of a man with a basic education and a common job and a lunch pail under his arm and a wife and kids that he kisses and he loves and he goes to work and he comes home and he takes him to church and he teaches them the bible and he lives an honest clean life what is that god hiding in the simplicity of that vessel and revealing himself in the same he can do something with that man that an archbishop don't know nothing about because an archbishop don't know the word the man with a lunch pail under his arm has more word than the archbishop has see you don't hear him blow no horns and send it out god just gets glory that's all the simple hear it and are glad now that's the beginning of the seal series that's the first of 10 messages he's going to preach and when he comes to the 10th message on the eighth day in the evening he comes to the seventh seal and when he comes to the seventh seal he says he's preaching along and he doesn't really get to the seventh seal yet he's really preaching the gap between the six and seventh seal of the 144 000 and the purge church and all of that he's preaching that and now he says now i'd better stop right here he hadn't said anything yet because because the seventh seal doesn't say anything nothing's not said and the seventh seal because it's being demonstrated through the whole week he doesn't have to say anything in the seventh seal because the seventh seal was revealed day by day as the seals were broke and loosed and given out the revelation of the seven thunders revealing what was under the seven seals what was that that was the seventh seal the lamb the lamb has taken the book the lamb has come the mighty angels come down with an open book in his hand the seven thunders are now seven consecutive thunders day after day after day and he says you see the mysterious part of this week it wasn't a man it was them angels well brother branham before he refers to junior jackson's dream he says see he he picked me up he told me to go out west i went out west got caught in the constellations to bring bring me back east the holy spirit interpreting those thunders interpreting the unwritten mystery i think is how he says it so what are those angels the holy spirit the seven spirits of god the portion of the spirit through each of the seven church ages it's all the same thing it's nothing different it's christ coming down to reveal the seals brother said he's the only one that can reveal amen praise be to god so who was revealing the seals christ he said it wasn't a man it was the angels them angels is christ we understand so what's the seventh seal brother branham brother member says have you seen the mysterious part of this week it's been going on all around you i'm sure they were sitting there like what was going on all around first seal second seal third seal fourth seal he come every day he didn't know what they were he knew know nothing more about it than anything and he just sat in that room until he came when he came he gave the revelation the word why because only the lamb can break the seals and he broke the seal and brother branham came out and he preached the seal because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be finished he goes back into the little room which is the third pool the little room brother graham said i've been by myself in a little room for eight days it's eternity he moved behind the veil into the little room i've been in a little room by myself and he would come to me who came amen the holy ghost every day would come amen and give him and give him more revelation of the seals peel back the first seal second seal third seal for seal and he come out and every day and he says the mystery's been going on all around you and you haven't caught it it wasn't the man it was the god hiding behind the man it was the revealing of the seventh seal when he revealed the book of redemption all them six seals just one big book six scrolls rolled together what's the seven the one who can take and peel open the others you see the mystery now and now all of that word and all of that revelation went where when the prophet left where did all that go it went into the bride and now the bride can go first seal second seal third seal now the bride's got the revelation of the seven thunders what does that mean if she can break the seals then who's hiding behind her flesh amen listen what he says in the seventh seal i better stop right there see i just feel checked not to say no more about it i'm laughing because if you know this really well and you've read through it you're reading reading reading he says i stop i feel like i'll say no more about it you're like you haven't said nothing about it at all so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and i want you to know before i ever knowed one word about that the vision came years ago you remember that and here it is just as this other slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and god knows my heart i never one time thought of such a thing as that and here it was it's later than we think oh my just shows us from god it fits exactly in the promises of god from the end of the the message you notice notice now for the end of time message this seal so the seventh seal is the end of time message and at the end of time what was sealed will be revealed so when when he told daniel seal it up until the time of the end he told john write not those things but seal them up now when it's time to unseal them it shows we're at the end time so the end time seal is the seventh seal when he unveils what's been sealed praise god and notice for the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible before knowing that remember revelations 10 1 7 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god will be known were at the end time the opening of the seventh seal he told you what did he tell me nothing because it was the whole week it was going on all around you the lamb was opening the seals he was here where was he hiding behind that flesh now listen what he says after he says all that we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal can you imagine sitting there that day without 50 some years to study over this and read it and pour over however many years you've poured over it how many times you've heard it preached but for the first time he said there it is he said this is the end time the opening of the seventh seal and you say you just said do i say no more about it you just told me i should have caught it if you're spiritual you'll catch it i have no idea what you're talking about there it is the opening of the seventh seal and then he comes right next statement now how did i know the other day last sunday a week ago today when i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god deals in little things i didn't realize what it really was talking about and now i see it it is in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed to the vatican but it comes just like john the baptist it comes like the birth of our lord and the stable glory to god so help me the hour is at hand we're here oh my now do you see it i love this french now do you see do you see it humble humble where was he in elijah's day behind the veil of elijah where was he he was hiding behind the skins god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same hiding in elijah ministry between an uneducated man kicked out by the world amen the whole ministerial association against him but behind the simplicity of that veil is god almighty with the full revelation of the mystery of god and he's giving it out day by day proving that it is the lamb not the man but it is the lamb working through that vessel amen to what to unite the head and the body to what to manifest the son of man again when the word now moves not just in the prophet but the word moves into you and you become the revelation of the seventh seal how did i know brother babies he's preaching to seven saying i feel checked i stop i'm not going to say anymore he says do you remember sabino canyon do you remember the sword in my hand the search the sword of the king the word of the lord amen and it fit my hand just perfect what was it it was the sword it was the word it was the word of god and it fit his hand perfect what's he doing hiding in simplicity revealing in the same it's so simple it's jesus christ in the form of that man breaking the seals you say it was jesus christ you know they started worshiping brother branham started baptizing in his name do you remember dawson roddy's testimony this isn't a tape it's not what brother branham said on tape so do you take it for what it's worth but in dawson riley's testimony dawson ryan brother man was telling dawson riley about the people that are baptizing his name and and and dawson was listening he said i was surprised he said you know they're baptizing my name they're teaching that i'm jesus christ and all this and dawson was just listening and brother made the statement he says they're not as far off as you think they're not as far off as you think and dawson made the statement he says well i was thinking they was pretty far off because brother branham that flesh man was not jesus christ but it was jesus christ in that flesh man and he was the mystery of the seventh seal breaking the seals and now the mystery of that seventh seal the endtime seal is in bride form and that's why he started with god hiding himself in simplicity it's so simple we have problems believing it ourselves it's so simple it's so humble amen that you can't look at the stable you've got to look at the life in the manger it says now it says now how did i know the other day last sunday a week ago today when i was preaching be humble be humble remember god deals in little things i didn't realize what i was really talking about and now i see it it's in such a humble way glory to god so help me the hour is at hand we're here oh my now do you see it the truth of god's vision the seven angels bringing me from the west they were coming from the west coming back east bringing me here for this message tonight what message was he preaching that night the seventh seal those mess those angels caught him up and brought him there for what to reveal the seventh seal how was the seventh seal revealed in the revealing of the six because it's the person of the seven seal jesus christ who revealed the six and it was going on all week it's been going on all around you and you missed it i say praise god help me not to miss it lord it's so simple it's so humble it's so simple it's so humble that god who's so great can come down in such simplicity to hide himself from the world that he can be born in a stable and a man and be laid in a manger and what was it it was jehovah in the form of a baby and it's so simple and it's so humble that it can be god amen poured down inside behind your flesh and it can be a man with a lunch bucket over her hand kissing his wife and his kids goodbye going to work and what is it it's the mystery of the seventh seal it's the unwritten portion of the word it's the it's the part of the word that's been hiding all through the bible that christ would have a bride and she's part of him just like eve came out of adam christ the bride came out of christ and she's she's word as he is word and in this last day it's the manifestation of jesus christ in her with a lunch bucket under his arm kissing his wife goodbye and going to work god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same and now when somebody looks at you and says is the seventh seal open he said you just say it depends on who you think i am that's the truth it depends on who you think we are it depends on who you think this bride is if the seven steel's still closed if you can't see him and her the seventh seal is not open to you but if you recognize where he's at now and you see him in a mini-membered body you see that he's been poured out into his bride amen the holy ghost that was bound through the church ages now has been loosed by the opening of the seals when the word came back the full life of jesus christ came back and now is dwelling in his people on this earth right now and what is that that's the mystery of the seven seal hiding in simplicity and revealing in the same amen praise god i'm all messed up praise be to god amen i don't know where i want to go i want to wrap up here let's go to luke chapter 2. i'll leave you with one thought and we are we me and nowhere near where i thought i was going to be but praise be to god just keep pulling don't shut your puller off yet a couple more minutes luke chapter 1 the new testament is interesting and you catch the order and the way things happen god is revealing himself in the structure of his word and and we have a visitation of gabriel to zacharias to tell zacharias he and his wife who is elizabeth who's barren is going to have a a word baby they're going to have a word baby because it's a prophecy going to come forth through them and then gabriel jumps over and talks to mary and tells mary she's going to have a word baby she's going to have the word baby the prophecy and so now you come to verse 38 chapter 1 verse 38 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judea judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when says this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believeth for there shall be performance of those things which were told her from the lord this is interesting let's go to verse 46 and then we'll talk about this and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaid for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he hath showed strength with his arm he has scattered the proud and the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seat and exalted them of low degree he hath filled the hungry with good things in the rich he hath sent empty away he hath opened his servants israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spoke spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house so here there's an angel that visits elizabeth or zacharias and talks about this conception elizabeth's going to have elizabeth conceives she conceives on the promised word a word baby and now mary conceives the word baby on the promised word that come through an angel amen was confirmed through an angel and she conceives and now elizabeth mary comes to elizabeth and all of a sudden when mary brings a salutation and brother branham said the first time that the name jesus was spoken the babe left within her and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she begins to prophesy she begins to identify amen before amen she's told amen anything about what's going on amen before she's told amen she has within her within her she has the life of the forerunner elizabeth represents the old church amen she's got the life of the forerunner inside of her and when she when she comes in contact with mary and mary gives a salutation that life inside of her jumps she's filled with the holy ghost amen you know i mean we can see our whole story right here the the baby leaves and she begins to prophesy and now it's not an angel from heaven it's not the priest in the temple but it's a woman now giving a prophecy and it's a woman with a word baby living inside of her because this is the new testament now now we're coming to a new dispensation amen the mail was the old testament that's been capped off by jesus christ but now we're moving into the feminine dispensation that's why the book of matthew opens amen it's got five women in the first chapter why because we're moving into feminine dispensation and now when the angel comes amen and the angel confirms the word and the word is conceived in the womb now amen when she meets mary all of a sudden she springs to life and says you're the virgin amen you are the mother of my lord amen inside of you is the word baby praise god why because of what was inside of her she could identify and then mary with the word in her amen as soon as as elizabeth speaks and identifies her now mary begins to speak and when mary begins to speak she's not wishy-washy she's not hopeful she's not hoping that she's the virgin she's not hoping she's conceived on the word she's not begging she's not pleading amen she's not bragging but what she says she speaks by the authority of the word amen and she says she says mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he has regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed she's not bragging she is under an anointing of the holy ghost and she is claiming her portion of the word her manifestation what the angel told her because this is what the angel told her and the angel has come to us and told us our position in the word that you are virgin virgin bride of jesus christ amen you are the spotless sinless virtuous virgin bride of jesus christ and he told us that we were going to conceive on the word amen and the word was going to be inside of us and we were going to bring forth to reproduce the son of man again amen if we can if we can catch the positive identification then we can speak with the authority of the word about our position and it's not bragging it's not boasting it's not putting somebody down to put somebody else up it's just stating the revelation that's in our heart under the anointing of the holy ghost that god has blessed me amen above all women god has blessed me god has called me god has put his word inside of me amen everybody all generations and all church ages will call me blessed why because the angel told me and i believed what he said and i received the word of the angel and said be it unto me according to thy word and when she said be unto me according to thy word she goes out to confess what the angel told her what she received from the angel where are we going to get it god sent an angel in this day to bring the message from heaven that it's now time for another virgin to conceive by a spoken word virgin conception to bring forth a spoken word baby just as what was prophesied for the virgin brother branham said amen all that was prophesied the bride now will fulfill all that was prophesied to be done in the virgin so we come right back to the same place and we start in the new testament with now these women are anointed by the spirit and speaking the word why because the new testament is going to be capped off with a woman anointed by the word amen by the holy ghost speaking the word for in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come why because they i have the authority of the word to bid the word to come to come where come to the place i am because the place where i am is where the fountain of living water is the bride did not come in revelations 22 17 after the revelation amen of the book of revelations after the capstone's been revealed she didn't come and say go go to the altar go to this church go to that minister go to that but she comes at the end of the book at the end of the capstone and the spirit and the bride say come amen come come come why because out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water the word is in you amen and the word can come out of you it's not go go go let's come come and drink come and drink jesus told the woman of the well if you drink of this water jesus was the well if you drink of this water you become a well of living water springing up into eternal life you drink of the will and become the well and now the new testament starts with these women who received an angelic visitation zechariah did elizabeth was part of zachariah she had the word in her mary had the word in her and they could speak out boldly the word of god i tell you have we conceived on the word has an angel come in our day has the angel given us our portion of the scripture have we the ability by faith to say be it unto me according to your word he comes in the first seal i said i no longer call you church i call you bri can you say be it unto me according to your word can we say i surrender all come if you if you want to use this body to bring forth your life use this body to bring forth your life mary got a bad reputation she got scorned and mocked and ridiculed but she knew she was blessed above all women can we speak with more authority by the holy ghost can you say god has looked on my lowly estate god has looked on the lowliest state of his handmaid and he now i i who was low have been lifted up he has exalted me he has given mercy he has exalted and now all all call me blessed not because i called myself that but because i received the word for this day and i received it for me i didn't receive it for my neighbor i didn't receive it from my church i didn't receive it for i received it from me and if you received it for you then you can speak your revelation it's not bragging it's not boasting it's the understanding of what the word is for this day can you say come can you say come have you arrived to a place where you found the fountain of living water and you've drunk from the fountain of living water and become the well of living water now coming out of you is coming the life of christ have you come to a place at the top of this mountain where you can honestly say come or are we still uncertain somewhere down the mountain trying to encourage people to go go if you go up there if you go here if you go there if you go talk to this person if you go talk to if you go up there you can have living water or can we by revelation say i'm not worthy ah he's looked on my low estate mary wasn't saying she was a great person mary wasn't thinking she was special she was significant she didn't no she says he looked upon my lowly state and he plucked me out of the murray clay and he lifted me up and he put his life inside of me and now it's him and me it's not me it's him and me but i know who's in me and it's him in me i know what i've drunk from and i know what well of water is in my soul and i know the fountain of living water and i want to say come not to this flesh not to me as a person but come amen and receive the word come and ask me a question come and listen to me for a minute come and ask me what happened in the garden come and ask me what day and age come and ask me why there's so many denominations come come come the new testament starts off with women impregnated by the word with the word inside prophesying speaking forth the word if you look chronologically not in the order of the bible's written but chronologically when elizabeth speaks it's the first human in the new testament to prophesy and it's a woman and the new testament ends with the spirit and the bride saying come in revelations 10 1-7 brings us to the mysteries of god revealed in the voice of the seventh angel but revelations 8 moves to the bride taking the book and rev revelations 10 8 and revelations 10 11 moves to the bride prophesying again what is the new testament it's the dispensation of the woman we've come to the end of the new testament the capstone comes down christ now comes in the formation of his bride to do what to give forth the water of life freely we have to know who we are and god bless you let's stand i don't want to go any further if i go one minute further we'll go one hour longer but praise god friends there's a lot more that i wish to get to and we'll pray sunday we'll see what direction the lord wants to go in but there's so much more on my heart that i'd like to share but don't miss god in simplicity and don't miss god in your simplicity well i know it's god and i know no listen it's more than that it's more than what was in the church ages it's more than what we've we've ever thought or known or seen before we've come down to the the revelation of the seventh seal and the revelation of the seventh seal such a mystery because it comes in three parts threefolds the first one god getting preeminence in a man the second one god i'm getting preeminence in a people and he's doing that now why preeminence so he can show his life when he got pregnant unto man it became the display of god and flesh when he gets preeminence in the people what will it be the mystery of the seventh seal in her and she the question is who are you that's the question who are you are you who the world says you are are you who your upbringing says you were or your family tree and records is that who you are or by revelation can you get an identification from a prophet messenger who will identify in this age where the dwelling place of christ is going to be can you hear the angel speak to you and says you're highly favored she didn't think she was highly favored but she said he said she was highly favored so she had to believe she was highly favored because he said she was highly favored not because she thought she was highly favored but because he said it do you understand god sent an angel in this day to tell you you're highly favored above all women that there's a time for a promise to be fulfilled and that promise is going to be fulfilled in you when you conceive by spoken word amen can you believe what mary believed can you speak like mary spoke god has lifted me up god has lifted me out of the mighty god has called me god has looked on my lowest state god has lifted me up and now all will call me blessed because i'm the most blessed of the most blessed of the most blessed because he has chosen me to put his word in to bring forth the son of man again and it's where is it it's in me mary didn't make no bones about it she knew where it was don't play around if god's revealed it to you confess where it's at amen watch your faith take off when you say what the word says i do say what the word says about you god is bringing us a greater reality of all of these things so we can act with a greater confidence and a greater boldness and quit halting around and start stepping into that image he had of us before the foundation of the world and be what he's called us to be not with halting steps and not not bashfully but just when mary got under the spirit she says it's right here i'm blessed can you say i'm blessed i am blessed i've been exalted he's lifted me up he's exalted me above all women why because i'm blessed because he chose me and i'm his handmaid and he told me it was me and i believe it's me and it's inside of me don't be ashamed of it friends and let's sing brother ben [Music] according to your promises the truth set me free according [Music] to me [Music] according to your promises [Music] me [Music] elizabeth spoke by inspiration she spoke by inspiration by revelation and what elizabeth said was the same thing the angel said but could we accept it coming from elizabeth [Music] can we accept it coming by elizabeth [Music] spoke it and it becomes scripture and we'll repeat it because we see it in print but don't forget it came through a woman [Music] who caught the revelation by inspiration and spoke the same thing the angel said but she didn't say as gabriel said i now said no she caught the revelation by inspiration of the holy ghost and she spoke and what she spoke was the same thing he spoke because the prophet and the spirit and the bride will all be saying the same thing how how will we ensure that they all say the same thing by only reading quotes and only reading the bible and never saying anything no by catching the same holy ghost that elizabeth caught under the same revelation by the same inspiration when you speak speak the same thing the angel said only now it's coming through a woman with the word on the inside when mary spoke when mary spoke you can find what mary said in the scriptures in the old testament mary spoke by inspiration she didn't recite the placing of the scripture under inspiration in the holy ghost she took her position and she just spoke the word can you receive it [Music] we do receive it it's in the bible i say the same thing's happening today god is speaking through his bride amen not new words what she'll be saying will have already been said in the word what you say or the prophet already said the angels already said it the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the whole same thing but she must be speaking by inspiration and revelation god bless you friends don't be afraid to speak your revelation don't be afraid to share what's in your heart don't be afraid to claim boldly what the angel has told you let the spirit lead amen let's sing that again brother [Music] i [Music] the truth according to the word o lord unto me let's sing it again [Music] according to your promises i [Music] [Music] [Music] let your word [Music] my [Music] it heart live inside this house and move me day by day [Music] oh [Music] let it live

perfect peace if you'll just keep your mind stayed on me let's sing it again [Music] on me stayed on me [Music] sweet release if you'll just need your mind stayed on me oh i love you my lord with all
