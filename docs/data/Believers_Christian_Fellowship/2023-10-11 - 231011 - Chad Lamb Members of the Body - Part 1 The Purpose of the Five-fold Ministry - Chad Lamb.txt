Lord for your faithfulness in our life and I thank you Lord that you you brought me back to this congregation and back to this place where we can stand together Lord and hear your word God I pray that you would bless us now as we open our Bibles and begin to read the scripture I pray God you would not just open the scripture but open our understanding to understand the scriptures may we see ourselves and see our place and see our purpose in this hour may you equip us Lord may you guide us by your word and strengthen us God may you find preeminence Among Us and may all that we do be pleasing to you in all things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all it's good to be back it's good to be here we had a wonderful time anden I really appreciate your prayers I really believe that God answered those prayers and helped us amen while we're standing let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 12 thank you musicians we'll just read one scripture while we're standing together 1 Corinthians chapter 12 while you're turning there I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who helped last Wednesday to make sure we could have the service and the fellowship hall we know the sound system wasn't quite complete so we had to we had to punt you know we had to divert over to the fellowship H but I thank God God gave us a place we could use and everybody came together the trustees and the deacons got together and made sure it all worked out and several of the young Brothers got together and moved things and brother Franco and Sister Amy went to work to make sure we had video and sound and they pulled it off I say praise God God bless them so I just want to give a big thanks to that to to them for that and thank God for that uh while we're standing quickly let's read 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 27 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular amen God bless you as you have your seats and we'll keep keep that thought and we're going to come back to that I just wanted to say a few things um I wasn't here Sunday but I I was able to listen to the service on the way home and I thoroughly enjoyed the service from Sunday so thank you brother Gabe it was quite a blessing and definitely could tell it it met a need amen and God was doing a tremendous work and we thank God for that I appreciate God's Ministry gifts amen and the way God has a diversity and he's able to take a brother and use him to meet the needs of his people and so we appreciate that I want to say thank you for that brother Gabe for getting out of the way and getting comfortable and walking all over the praise God brother we love you amen I love God's variety you know I watch him do that I thought man that looks fun and it looks comfortable when everybody likes it I might try that and I no I probably won't we got to leave something for brother Gabe to do you know the different gifts have to do their own thing amen but praise God I just thank God that we have the ability to be free to be what we are amen not try to be something else amen that's wonderful also I wanted to say a welcome to sister tiaba from Germany God bless you she was here Sunday but I didn't get a chance to greet her amen she's a friend of sister zabella and also the Ley girls and my daughter Brianna they met her when they were in Germany this past summer invited her over and she came so God bless you it's a pleasure to have you amen I want to say thank you also for praying for our trip uh over to British Columbia we were there for their Thanksgiving weekend meetings and we ended up having uh a Thanksgiving potluck Fellowship on Friday I said Thank God that's my kind of party amen so we had a wonderful time with the Saints there we knew some of them got to see them again after several years had wonderful fellowship with brother Chris meritz the pastor there and I thoroughly enjoyed that and uh also the services were we had good feedback from the services I was I I was thankful that it was a blessing because I had no idea what to do I was a little bit disc combobulated going in and couldn't quite find the right angle and all of a sudden the last minute it all comes together and I just trust God Amen anden it just goes to show we don't have anything figured out so thank you for your prayers it's good to be back home also want to let you know that this Sunday brother Danny dundo from the Philippines will be here and he'll be ministering for a Sunday so he comes in Saturday night and he's just making a quick stop he's going to be here Saturday through Monday so just be praying for his travels amen also just wanted to make a comment as most of you probably know watched the news we know that Israel's at War again anden I just find it uh amazing how the pressure just keeps building I mean this is nothing new they've been through this cycle many many times but you know that the that that the church parallels Israel in many ways so if they're constantly Under Pressure what do you think we're constantly under if they're always at risk of bombardment of Rockets of of of attacks I think we're the same way amen the devil's constantly trying to find a way to disrupt the plan of God Amen but thanks be to God we have we have weapons of warfare amen so we've just been praying for the situation there and it's just tragic and it's hard to watch and hard to see and but we know it's part of the end time sequence and part of the end time cycle is something that's inevitable and can't be stopped the pressure has to build and the pressure has to build and until finally all the world gathers against Israel and we're watching that as it unfolds and it's been unfolding over the last 50 60 years but we're continuing to watch that and so we just know that our time is Drawing Near amen don't know how near I sometimes when I look at things like this I'm like oh I wish the prophet were here to tell us exactly what this meant because without a prophetic gift all you can do is guess and I I quit the guessing business long time ago after I had a 100% failure rate I decided to quit but we know it's it's it's Unique the timing is unique and we watch stuff like that happen they just finished the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of Tabernacles is the last feast in the Harvest cycle it's the seventh feast and they after they finish the seventh Feast the next day was the Sabbath and on that Sabbath day the war broke out the attack happened I can't tell you exactly what that means but I know it's significant amen we know all of these things are significant they always go to war right around the feast days if you've watched that I mean the last time it was the yam kapor War so there's definitely something that God is doing and the war broke out on the 10th month in the seventh day so we're back to 107 again so we know all of these things are significant and we don't know how we can't pinpoint why we don't know all the details neither can we draw all the conclusions but we can just look and by the things that we know we can say there's a significance to this amen and we just want to make sure that we're we're praying that God will help them amen because God's with Israel like he's with us amen because he still got a work to do there but I say God help us to be vigilant to be ready amen because our time of pressure is coming too it's mounting it's building amen it may not be all out War but it's going to be a spiritual war and we feel it all the time but say God help us to be vigilant and help us to be ready amen as we look at this subject uh I wanted to preach a subject called members of his body members of his body and we get that from the scripture in 1 Corinthians 12 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so not some future date but now we are his body but I am a member in particular of the body so the body is the whole the member is me so I'm part of that body and so the title is members of the body but the subtitle is the purpose of the fivefold ministry the purpose of the fivefold ministry when we were at The Retreat uh brother Eugene took a a minute and he talked to us at lunchtime talked to the officers and the ministers in the church and he mentioned something about the fful ministry and it really struck me and it opened a whole another layer for me and I wanted to bring this to you I ministered on this Sunday night this past Sunday night in British Columbia and uh I just kept dwelling on it and I wanted to bring it home so I can share with you some of the things I shared with them and so it'll be a little different of course but I just want to share some of these things and Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet said and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and speaking of Jesus Christ he he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body amen the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she and she alone stands by it amen that is the revelation of the hour amen that Christ is here he's present he's here in Bride form in the formation of his bride Amen in his bride body and she and she alone stands by it because she's the only one who believes it amen but she so believes it that she stands by that Revelation amen and so it's important that we keep this at the Forefront of our understanding this is the manifestation of this hour this is the revelation of this moment in time that we're in this is what is we've come to the critical uh climax of this God's been building a body over seven Church ages but now at the end time he's capped it off with himself and now it's the complete fullness of him in body The Head and the body has United as one and she is his body amen not in the building process amen but in the completion phase now and it's coming to the very final Climax and the message things that are to be he says now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband there we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour that's right what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour you can say that in Reverse what is the manifestation of this hour the word bride and ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so what am I I am part of the manifestation of this hour the manifestation of this hour has everything to do with me amen I'm not all of it but I am certainly part of it amen amen so the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or a denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so we don't want to be mistaken of what hour we're living in or what the manifestation of this hour is amen because all of that why all of that Revelation deres our purpose amen it's not just about knowing something because we can know something but it's not about knowing something because he said it's the manifestation of the hour it's not the knowledge of the hour or those a knowledge it's not just the revelation of the hour because it also is a revelation but it is the manifestation of the hour that means that this knowledge this Revelation has to take on life it's got to be living a living Oracle of God so it's got to be a body a many membered body that is actually his body on Earth with the head amen connect ected to the body living its life through the members of the body that is the manifestation of the hour so we can talk about it we can even sing about it we can have the revelation of it but if it doesn't come into manifestation we've still missed the purpose of the Revelation one thing I found is is is you can never you can never move into a manifestation amen of your purpose of of your of your calling and if you don't know what your purpose is it's like getting being hired for a job they now give you they hire you now work for a company but they don't tell you your title they don't give you your job roow they don't tell you what the expectation is you just show up to work one day and you stand there in the middle of the building wondering what am I supposed to do I'm hired I'm part of it I have the Revelation but what is the purpose of your hire what are you supposed to be doing and so this revelation of this hour amen it brings us knowledge brings us Revelation but it also gives us a purpose and that is what we're seeking to fulfill in this hour is that purpose and Christ is revealed in his own word he says and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam Adams was rather at the beginning so now the complete body of Christ what's the complete body of Christ male and female United back together now the complete body of Christ is revealed how is the complete body of Christ revealed in the form of a bride amen the complete body of Christ which is male and female the complete Adam the complete body of Adam was Adam and his wife United back together but the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride amen that's the hour that we live in that's what this message came to declare that's what his message came to awaken us to and that is our purpose in this life is to Manifest this now let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and I think this evening we're just going to lay down this principle and look at this and I I don't think I'll get very far I think I'll pick it up next Wednesday Lord willing into a second part which is really the part I really want to get to but you know how it goes that's just the way it goes amen you may not know how it goes I don't always know how it goes but this is the way it goes sometimes you just get into something and it just keeps opening keeps opening you got to take one piece before you take the next piece and sometimes the piece that attracted you you can't even get to yet tell you that may not be for you but that's just for me that's just the way it works I've learned to quit trying to be something that I'm not is what I am Ephesians chapter 4 let's begin at verse 11 because we're going to start talking about the purpose of the fivefold ministry it says here and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers we know that these are five Ministry gifts we know them as the fful ministry that's the term that we use and we've heard a lot about the fful ministry brother Brenham says a lot about it in the message um we've we've heard a lot about it a lot of that's been discussed and in the environment we find ourselves in in the end time when when there's efforts sometimes to minimalize the fold Ministry or even in some cases do away with the fivefold ministry and declare it unnecessary anymore then there's been a great defense rise up of the fivefold ministry so you keep hearing terms like we need a five-fold Ministry God has a five-fold Ministry I mean the bride has a Ministry his Apostles prophets evangelist teachers and pastors and we hear all of that and so we are very well-versed in the fact that God has a fful Ministry we believe that we we've repeated it we've talked about it we've hammered on it because of the because of the detraction from that truth amen so we've come along we've really reinforced that and so we all know there's a fful Ministry we probably all of us in this room can name all five of them because we've heard it so much amen and we we know that that's part of God's word and he's not taking it out and it's not diminished and it's not finished but now I want to say but what is the five full ministry supposed to do we've defended it we've know we have it we know it's the word of God but what's the purpose amen this is what I always come to I I I know something's true and I know it's right and I know it's the word but what's it supposed to do I don't know if that's just my nature I always want to know what's it supposed to do I don't know how it works I guess that's why I took stuff apart as a kid you know how does it how does it do this so what is the fivefold ministry supposed to do cuz we we know we have a five-fold Ministry we know it's not done away with we know know it's not dommin and we'll stand up and fight for it but what's the fful ministry supposed to accomplish let's go uh brother Frank if you can pull up the Whiteboard for me I'm going to go to that in verse 11 we'll read again and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints so now we're getting into the purpose all right now we're getting into the purpose for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so I want to write this down so that we don't we don't lose these things the purpose of the fful ministry he gave for the perfecting of the Saints amen so what are we coming to church for what am I listening to the prophet for what am I listening to the tapes for for the perfecting of the Saints this word perfecting is not the same word perfect that we read through the rest of the Bible that word most of the time when you read the word perfect in the New Testament it means fully mature or complete or full but this word perfecting means equipping or Furnishing so the purpose of the fivefold ministry is to equip the Saints or to furnish the Saints to give you all the tools you need amen for the equipping or Furnishing of the Saints for the work of the ministry now this word ministry can mean uh Ministry like we normally use it ministering from the pull pit but really the word ministry actually just means serving amen so this is this is for the serving of the body the work of the service or the work of the ministry and then we get to the third one out of the scripture the edifying of the body of Christ this word edifying means to build or to build up so what is the purpose of the ministry for the equipping or Furnishing of the Saints the work of the ministry the edifying the building up of the body of Christ not so we can say we believe in fivefold Ministry well of course we believe in fivefold Ministry but are we getting the benefit of the fivefold ministry because the benefit of the fful ministry is not to say you know I've got a good pastor amen but if you're not equipped and if you're not being built up in the body of Christ so what amen so what we believe in a fful Ministry what's it supposed to do and is it accomplishing that in my life brother benam said we don't come to church to see our good parts we come to see our bad parts we come to hear the word we come to hear our purpose we come to get stuff shaved off of us we get stuff we come to get lined back up with the purpose and calling of God Amen we come in the fful ministry is supposed to be equipping the Saints amen doing the work of the service of the body and building up the body of Christ amen amen and so let's go to the the the next verse here till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I love this scripture because all of a sudden we you know when we look at this I've read this myself so many times my emphasis has always been on the five full ministry and and so we know that but now immediately he turns from the five Ministry gifts and he goes right here till till we all come into so now it went from the fivefold ministry to the body here we are this is the purpose till we all come to something Amen brother brandham says in putting on the whole armor of God he says now God fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a SE or foresee before Satan ever gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church I mean this is pretty intense what is the five4 ministry he said it it's the inside dress the undergarments what are the undergarments the thing that's close closest to Christ himself and the first thing that begins to reflect him to the world is the dress the undergarments the inside dress amen God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dressar amen so we realize now we're not talking about men this has nothing to do with men this is God hiding in Behind These offices if it's not that then it's not going to serve the purpose if it's not that then we got off the rail somewhere because if it become about men and these are men these aren't men these are gifts amen the gifts happen to fall in men because that's where the gifts fall but the gifts aren't men the gifts fall in men the gifts are gifts uh Christ gave amen and it's God himself dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers eventers what what is that that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man that's why to me the fful ministry I mean the the the ministry doesn't exist to make celebrities out of a few men it's not here to make message celebrities or message Elite amen so that this is my favorite Minister and this is the best this and this and he's got this and that's not what it's for but so many times it's what it becomes amen it becomes a platform demonstration it becomes a ppit show pull pit show and it becomes about the man amen with the gift instead of about God veiled behind that flesh ministering what's he doing he is equipping his Saints he's working the ministry through the veil of Flesh he's edifying the body this is a whole Act of God equipping serving shaping his people for their purpose it's not about the man to make the man something great amen so we've got to keep these things in check in our mind because it's so easy to go because you know what we're human beings and human beings all have the same fallacy am mean we all have the same weaknesses amen everybody wants a hero everybody wants everybody wants a great man amen I would have had I hey I would have loved the be on David's side in the Old Testament I would love to have David as my king and I'm following David and it's all about David and David's the great I would love to be that amen but that's not what then all of a sudden I miss my purpose what am I supposed to be doing amen I know who David is but who am I I know who the preachers are but who am I and I know what the preachers are here for but what am I here for am I just here to support a preacher so that he has a platform to preach from no really the preacher here to support you we got to get this right amen and you know God has divided his gifts amen God has placed him where he wants God calls his Minister they're not voted in they're they're not chosen by the church they're chosen by God Amen nobody has a say in it God does this is God's Gift God's choice God's placing God's Ministry and the best thing that a man can do that has this gift is to get himself out of the way and try to lay him self bear so that he doesn't ruin what God's trying to do but you realize these things go two ways so we have we have people who want a champion but we also have men who love Limelight and Prestige and honor and and listen if we think yeah yeah them over there and them over there we are all susceptible to those things we are human beings amen we are all of us human beings and we have to recognize amen that we keep this thing lined up the right way and keep our minds lined up the right way so that we recognize the word of God for what it is and we don't over promote amen overvalue or undervalue we can go we can say well I'm not going to promote a man so I'm not going to pay an ounce of attention to him or listen to anything has to say we're just as wrong on the right side of the road as we are on the left side Amen brother said the hardest thing God's ever had to do is get one human being to believe another one Ah that's a challenge amen so so it can go wrong both ways amen but that's why the bride always finds herself tiptoeing on the razor's Edge amen because one step this way I'm wrong one step this way I'm wrong amen this is a walk of Faith this is the leadership of the Holy Ghost we're never going to get this intellectually we're never going to get it relying on our Humanity because it's so dangerous either way am brother man goes on want to say in the message and then Jesus came he says and God has sent in the church five different gifts Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors these are for the perfecting of the Saints this is his proof his ministering Spirit to the church to bring the body of Christ together what's the purpose to bring the body of Christ together so to to overinflate the man is wrong to fail to honor the vessel the gifts in is wrong this is why it I say all the time religion is so dangerous we're it's like we are playing with dynamite all the time yes sir this word that God's given us can d destroy us if we go either way the wrong way we need to I'm so glad that God sent us a prophet Amen to keep us lined up but it's going to take the spirit of God or else we'll even take that Prophet the wrong way so we have to stay submitted to Christ and say God I mean I think it's good just to say all the time God I'm trusting you please help me I'm not trusting myself I'm trusting you because if left to myself I'll mess this thing up amen like every other generation has messed this up I'm just as much human as they were in the Dark Ages I'm just as much human as they were in Luther's day or and Wesley's day in Pentecostal Revival I'm just as I'm just as much susceptible to failure it is because of your grace amen it's because of your calling in my life if I ever stayed true it's because you decided I would stay true help me God so now we went from these five Ministry gifts falling into the church now we can we can attach those to individuals of course because God works through man God's put himself on partnership with man God doesn't do anything unless he works through man so this is the presence of God this is the spirit of God these are the gifts of God this is the ministry of God but it's coming through man but now we go quickly in this scripture from the man now to the whole congregation and when we go to this next scripture I'm going to switch the screen here this is until we come into into what the unity of the faith I love how it didn't say the unity of the doctrine because then we would be forcing each other to conform to each other's ideas but till we can come to the unity of the faith because you know what my understanding May deviate just a little bit from your understanding and as we're growing amen I can tell you this my understanding was not what it was a year ago it's not what it was 6 months ago so I'm so glad that a year ago I didn't force you to conform to my understanding to be right so please don't force me to conform to your understanding to be right but let's just have the unity of Faith let's just believe that God sent this message and it is the truth and his word is true and we're still growing in it amen but we all have the same goal the same love the same passion which is the message amen and we stay under the messenger for our age and we stay subjected to his word and to the offices God put in place and we all just grow together let's just come to the unity of that faith that we believe this message is absolutely sent from God that we have amen the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication that the Bible has been perfectly interpreted in this age that the seals are open amen that God that Christ has returned and that he's going to manifest himself through his bride in the last time that's the unity of the faith now my understanding of that is going to grow I I want it to grow I don't want to stop here I want it to grow yours is going to grow so let's come to the unity of the faith and grow amen and our understanding will grow amen somebody asked me before will we ever all agree on everything I have no idea I'm not even going to try to answer that question because I really don't care as long as you're there and I'm there at the end of the road I don't care if our understanding is exactly right let's just keep climbing towards the same thing sometimes people ask questions that no no human being can ever answer are we all going to see eye to eye and exactly agree by the time of the rapt like 30 seconds before the Rapture we're all going to finally click we all I have no idea who can answer that but I know this every elect predestinated seat is going to be exactly what they're supposed to be at the time of the translation of the body whatever God determined that will be amen we get we get so fixated on things let's not get fixated on them let's come to the unity of the faith amen we're pressing towards the same thing now look at this now to the knowledge this is understanding of the Son of God God wants to share himself with us he wants to be understood he wants to be known he wants to reveal himself to us this is not theology this is relationship he wants us to come into a deeper Rel relationship he wants us to come into Fellowship so he's going to use the fivefold ministry Amen to bring us into the unity of the faith and to bring us into the knowledge of the Son of God because he is standing behind the veil constantly unveiling himself so we constantly know more about him more of what he likes more of what he's like more of what he's done and more of why he's done it so that we can move into a closer relationship then it says unto a perfect man this word perfect is the one that we normally use for fully mature or complete or full to a full man and then that we come to the stature of the fullness of Christ I'm going to put it like this the stature of a perfect man what is the fful ministry supposed to do bring us all into the stature of a perfect man bring us into adoption bring us into the to where the son now reflects the father now he's living just like the father remember when brother Brandon preached adoption and brother B was he was dramatizing and he's saying you God gives the best tutor he can give and it's the Holy Ghost and and can you imagine the tutor coming to the father and he's saying you know this is not a very good son he's not listening he's not that but he said then there's the other side there's a good son and he comes to them and he comes to the father he said how he would love to give the report and he says father he says he handles the Sheep just like you do you should have seen him the other day handle this and said it was just like you do what's taking place in adoption in adoption you have a son born from a father this father now has shared his genetics with this son this son now is made in the image of the father amen and so now the father has turned him over to a tutor to raise him up to raise him up to be like what to raise him up to be a reflection of the father because the tutor says he did it just like you do it amen because why he's going to turn the farm The Inheritance the business over to the son and he wants the son to be able to run it just like he runs it so the purpose of the tutor the Holy Ghost amen is to bring the son to bring all those genetics out of the Sun so the Sun starts reflecting the father amen he did it just like you why did he do it just like you because he's got your temperament he's got your nature he's got your seed inside of him amen and now the tutor is here to bring us into the reflection of Jesus Christ because his life is on the inside of us and the tutor is bringing us Amen to to do what amen they he he took that rejection just like you take it just like you did when you were going to Calvary just like when you were here amen Walking By the Sea of Galilee and they and they they mocked you and they ridiculed you and they called you a devil amen and you didn't react amen look he just did it just like you did it there GL to God this is adoption what's the fful ministry to do to help us to come into the statue of it's the Holy Ghost the tutor it's the Holy Ghost the tutor how's he speaking he's clothed in a five-fold Ministry amen let's read the next verse that we henceforth be no more children this is immature talk lost to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so let's write this next one down we're still on the purpose of the fivefold ministry so it's amazing how quickly we turned from a man in a pull pit yeah to the purpose of the Min to the people so I say the emphasis in the scripture is not the men this gift is and the emphasis is what it's doing to all of us that was the purpose that's the emphasis and they're going to continue to minister that we so our purpose that we are not carried about by every wind of Doctrine the fful ministry is here to stabilize the church so every new thought that comes in doesn't send us running every new teaching every new idea amen we the ministry is here to bring a stabilization amen the ministry shouldn't be the ones bringing instability they should bringing us a stability Amen to where now every new thing that sweeps through it doesn't it doesn't scatter it doesn't cause us to run it doesn't cause us to get tossed to and fro amen we're already stabilized we already know who we are in Christ we already know that we have been chosen by God and God is revealing himself to us and every new thing that comes down it may be a direct Revelation from God it may be another wind of Doctrine that's moving through amen but I don't have to be shaken if it's God who reveal it to me because I'm stable in who I am I am his bride he will reveal the truth to me I don't need tossed around like a child because of every new teaching that comes I can hold steady amen what's going to Help Me Hold Steady this is the purpose of the five-fold ministry so you have a true identification of who you are coming into a maturity so you don't get knocked around every time something new sweeps through cuz something new may be absolutely genuine from God another level he wants to take us through it could be another mixed idea of man amen and we don't know we could get tossed and Scattered and run about and arguing and fighting with who's right and who's wrong what we need to do is be stable and not be like children and Hold Steady if it's of God it'll ring true it'll ring true it'll ring true it'll stay it'll grow and it won't change amen but I don't need to worry about it if half my brothers see it and I don't see it that shouldn't change my identification with who I am I need to wait till God shows me amen way I don't need to pretend I see something I don't see that means I don't need to go with the crowd because this is the more spiritual crowd I don't need to give up my my my own discernment amen because this is a more senior brother amen no I'm not getting tossed by every wind of Doctrine a true fold ministry will establish the bride so they're not getting tossed about they're not immature they've come into a place where they know who they are and when something new comes they can say praise the Lord if this is from God it'll ring true let's just wait I don't see it yet but let's just watch tell you something else that it'll do amen they'll just watch until they see the nature of that thing go sounds good it sounds good but what life is it producing what's the nature of that thing I'm not getting tossed about by everything that sounds good but behind it comes an arrogant spirit and behind it becomes a nasty attitude and behind it becomes division no I think I'll just wait because I'm not going to lose my sunship that's right I'm not going to lose my position with Christ I'm not rejecting the word I'm just not jumping in amen the ministry should be making the Believers stable mature until we grow up into him I love this part in all things who is the head Christ am the fivefold ministry is going to keep working until we grow up unto him in All Things am not just some things I said I believe with all my heart many of us has grown up into him in some some things but there's still some things I need to grow up in I don't know if you're like me but I'm still growing amen I've grown up into the head in some things but there's other things amen there's things there's days when I'm like oh Lord I'm so glad that you chose me before the foundation of the world cuz you wouldn't choose me now amen but the B Ministry is supposed to help us till we grow unto him in all things in every area of our life till we grow to full maturity to the Head where the head has full control of all things in our life so many times he has control amen of our conduct but he doesn't have control of our fears amen sometimes he has control of our eyes but not control of our mouth or control of our mouth but not control of our eyes our control of our eyes but not control of our thoughts thoughts but we're going to keep going till we grow up un him in all things in the head till the head has absolute pre predominance Over All of Me amen and so I I want to go back and read this scripture again because I love the way uh verse 14 moves into verse 15 so let's pay attention to this that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby by they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ I love how this goes from Doctrine to truth yes sir amen pay close attention to that transition that we're no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine but we are speaking the truth in love you know it's not about Doctrine it's about the truth and the truth brings the correct Doctrine we're not opposed to Doctrine Doctrine just means teaching I love Doctrine amen but there's some teaching that's not truth there's some teaching that's not the point but but that we're not cared about by every window of Doctrine but we're speaking the truth amen what am I always speaking I'm not repeating what somebody else says I'm not trying to understand something but I'm just speaking the truth truth amen what I know to be true what I see what I was revealed to me what I see is the scripture what I know to be absolutely the word of God I'm just speaking the truth with love I love that little transfer from Doctrine which is tossing to truth which is an expression of love I love how the Bible's written now I believe verse 16 is the culmination of the whole subject why we have a fful Ministry from whom so the last verse says that we may grow into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom so from Christ from the head the whole body fitly joined together that means tightly joined together amen and compacted that word compacted means knit or coales together actually woven together so not only we're tight together we become woven together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth every joint is every Bond every Bond amen listen you're not a joint the joint is every Bond you have with another believer by by every joint supplieth so every joint every bond between Believers is supplying something according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love this verse 16 to me is the culmination of the whole matter what is the the purpose of the fold Ministry verse 16 till every member every part every joint is doing their part to build up Christ now this isn't the job of the fivefold ministry to build up Christ it's the five of it's It's the job of the fivefold ministry to equip every part till every part builds itself up in love you know why I like this part so much it's a shift of responsibility and it makes me feel good because we can't expect the preachers to do all this amen the preachers have their part amen and and all they're doing is surrendering to Christ on the inside to the gift that's there and that gift is there to equip us to perfect us to grow us to stabilize us to do all of those things until amen we come in into a mature believer until we come into the stature of the fullness of Christ that we're not tossed about that we're established that we can speak the truth in love that we can grow up into the head and all things that we can become tightly bound to our brothers woven together and be a joint that Supply Amen to every need and builds itself the body builds itself together in love now there's no way that you can come on a Sunday and come on a Wednesday and go home and hope that the preachers do a good job and hope that they complete this work amen they're only here to equip you to stabilize you to to to to give you the knowledge of the Son of God Amen so that you can finish the work of building the body of Christ it's every single member it's every part to the measure of every part every joint everyone is the one who's going to finish this work the preachers are not going to complete the body of Jesus Christ the members are going to build themselves together in love so you can see how the wrong attitude to the fful ministry on either part either the ministers or the people will actually become a deterrence to the purpose of the fivefold ministry and it will actually handicap and Railroad and and deter God's actual purpose for the ministry gifts he ascended on high and he gave gifts unto men what were those gifts to do it was supposed to get us in position so that we can finish the work that was left for this day for each one of us to do now who's responsible for the body of Christ now I'm responsible for the body of Christ you're responsible each one of us have a responsibility Amen to be a joint that supply and the meure of every part I love this part because the whole success of the whole body is not rested on the fold Ministry it's shifted the responsibility to every individual member nobody's coasting no sir nobody's free riding no nobody's just taking up space that's right nobody's just along for the ride you see how everything changes yes sir this is when the preacher starts feeling so much better if I can just stay out of the way and let God do what he's going to do then the body is going to do what it's supposed to do and I don't have to carry the whole weight of the full responsibility because there's no way the fivefold ministry can do this this is Way Beyond ministers this all falls on every one of us so let's read this again from whom the whole body fitly joined together tightly together and compacted knit together by that which every joint Supply how did it get fitly formed together and knit together by every joint every bond between Believers supplying something something has to come out of you into the other believers amen according to the effectual working that word effectual is an unusual word it means it can be interpreted efficient or an efficient working but almost every time it's used in the New Testament it's used of Supernatural power this effectual working is more than just our effort this is God and every member to the effectual or effective or efficient working in the measure of every part are you part of the body amen then here we are making increase of the body what body the body of Christ making increase of the body unto the edifying building up of itself in love praise God I'm going to write here until we all because I'm included in this every part of the five home Ministry is included in this because we're part of the body you know I've said before in conversation I might have said it from the pull pit I don't need to be a preacher to be a Son of God like I do this not because I even wanted to it's not that I don't want to I don't want you to take that the wrong way it's not like I hate it I love serving God's people I want to do exactly what God calls me to do but I wasn't looking to minister when God called me and I was never looking to Pastor when God supernaturally called me I I was very content in the role that I was in so I never did this because I wanted it I did this because God called me to it was God's purpose I'm very happy being a Son of God and I can't think of any title that you could attach to that would to be better than just Son of God how can you be Son of God and make it just a notch better with another title you know if I had Deacon behind it that if I had Pastor no son of God's the highest honor that we could ever have being a child of almighty God is the very highest thing that we could ever achieve after that we all have different roles to play and different parts in the body different things he want us to do but don't ever if we ever get the attitude that Ministry or or office in the church or a special gift of songwriting or singing or or whatever amen that that's somehow the Pinnacle my goodness the Pinnacle is to be a son or daughter of God that's the very best thing that you could ever be and then if wherever God places you in that body you're placed there to be a joint that Supply Amen to the effectual working of the measure of every part as it edifies itself together and and to build the body in love amen you sing songs Amen to edify the body you write a song to edify the body amen you take care of the facilities amen you sweep the floor you fix a meal for a friend you do whatever God's called you to do the build up the body not to be something better in the kingdom of God and not to have a better title and not to get some more accolades you do it because you're an effectual part working and supplying and through every joint but the greatest thing I could ever be is a Son of God if I stop preaching tomorrow I'll be a Son of God if I never get in the pull pit again I'll be a Son of God and just as content to be a Son of God as anything in the world that's the greatest honor of my life whether I'm standing here or sitting there I prefer to sit there it's better which is funner brother Gabe sitting by your wife or standing up here I'd rather sit next to to my wife every Sunday but I can't do that and stay true to what God's called me to do I can't do that and be obedient to Christ I can't do that and serve the body and be the joint I'm supposed to be amen so now it's not about Prestige honor offices it's about service how am I supposed to serve the body how am I a joint that supplies how am I working together in the measure of my part to build the body in love this is the responsibility each one of us need to come to terms with because this is our responsibility until we all become a joint that supplieth how do you spell Supply there's TW PS that's all of us that's not the officers that's not the ones with a title that's all of us we're all responsible for this every one of us have to be a measure a part that builds the body now I'm I'm personally responsible for building the body of Christ am now I become personally responsible for the health of that body personally responsible for the growth of that body what now the question is what can I do to help grow what can I do to supply what can can I do we'll get to that in a minute until every part is working two increase the body to build the body in love this is what we are all responsible for this is the conclusion of the purpose of a five-fold Ministry I love it it's not about gifted men it's not about great gifts and super duper preaching and platform performances that stun and wow an audience that's not what this is about it's become that many times because of the Fallen nature of all of us and we should just say all of us but that's not the point the point is this is supposed to be God equipping his children growing them maturing them building them equipping them stabilizing them so that each one of them can finish the work and grow the body supply and increase remember brother Brenham said Jesus didn't finish all of his work in his Earthly Ministry left some of it to be done in and through the bride he didn't didn't say 10% of the Bride the ones with offices and positions and titles we all have a part to play and finishing the work of Christ until we all come in to the stature of a perfect man uh when I look at this I want to back up now and read the beginning part of chapter 4 I skipped down for a purpose now I want to get to the the beginning chapter 4 4 verse one therefore the prisoner of the Lord therefore I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called that vocation is not job that vocation just means your calling your invitation that you all walk worthy of the calling wherewith you are called with all lonliness loneliness is is humility with all humility and meekness meekness means means gentleness with all loneliness and meekness and longsuffering that's patience and forbearing that's caring for one another forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all all and through all and in you all but but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity and he gave gifts unto men so I love this precursor because he starts off with all of you walk with humility gentleness patience caring for one another endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and then he goes right into God gave gifts he goes into the five gifts what the five gifts are supposed to do for each one of us and he ends amen this whole portion of this dialogue with every part now do your part he started with every part Walk This Way and end with every part do your part so this section of scripture is not about the five gifts this section of scripture is about what all of us are supposed to do and the five Ministry gifts are supposed to help us do that praise God let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 I'm just going to read a couple lengthy scripture readings together as we wind down this will be just the first part and we'll pick it up again later 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 4 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration ation but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same God which worketh all and in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all I'm going to stop here let's look at this for just a second there are diversities of gifts so there there is this is a lot of different gifts whenever he mentions the gifts he starts going through the gifts every account there's a Romans account there's a Corinthians account and there's one other maybe two in Corinthians he always gives different gifts it's never the same gifts listed because there's diversity of gifts but the Same Spirit right and there are differences of administrations there's different ways that gift is administered but it's the same lord and there are diversities of operations there's different ways that it's operated so all of a sudden this scripture just ripped open our preconceived ideas about what gifts are amen amen there's many gifts with many administrations and many different operations amen there's not just a couple there we know that there's nine main spiritual gifts but there's lots of other gifts because the Apostle Paul mentions other gifts outside of those so we don't want to just get narrowed down amen anything amen anything that the spirit of God God gives you to do to supply the rest of the body is a gift to the body and verse seven but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all that means whatever he gives to you is for everybody else a gift is not given to you for you a gift is given to you for the body remember remember brother Brandon was standing at the pull pit praying for people who were sick so sick he would have to grip the edge of the pull pit CU he was so weak he was about to collapse with his stomach issue and he was so weakened by it he couldn't hardly stand gripping the pull pit praying for people and every one of them is getting healed but he's not getting healed and he says the gift wasn't for me it's for you brother B says in one place he says listen he said you would think because I have a gift of Prophecy God would just always show me in a vision what to do but he just lets me sit he doesn't always show me I have to sweat it out and one place he says I'm standing like an orphan this morning God's left me the gift wasn't for him the gift was for me that man's gift was for me to build me up to supply me to build up the body of Christ in love and build this part up that gift was for me it wasn't for him in fact he W I mean he wasn't a tremendous benefactor of that gift it cost him a lot yes it costed him his friends it cost him mental strain it cost him stress it caused him all kinds of difficulty I I I would venture to say it would have been much easier for him just to be a good Christian and a good church and a good bible church and to raise his family and to love his wife and stay at home every evening and work his Powerline job and come home every evening and hunt all he wanted that gift wasn't for him that gift was for me and so the spirit the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man for with all for everyone else and the Apostle Paul is going to take the body of Christ and he's going to match it to our physical bodies he's going to use an analogy and he's going to make the natural type to spiritual amen and Paul's the one who's going to establish this and he's going to talk about we're going to ready to read about it here in a little bit but if you think about it I can't think of one member in my body that is in my body to serve itself can you think of any part of your body that only exist to serve itself I've been thinking about it and I'm scared to say that because somebody will come up with some super clever genius idea but as I've been meditating I can't think of any part of my body that solely exists serve itself but every member in my body is serving another part of my body or the body and whole either directly or indirectly so what do you think we're on this planet for what do you think you're in a church for what do you think you're in the bride for amen whatever gifts God has given to you amen they're not there to make you rich to give you an easy life they have a big retirement account and retire and travel the world on cruise ships whatever God gift God has given to you he's given to you to profit with all amen whatever is in you is for me whatever you're good at is for my benefit whatever gift you have is for me amen so I'm tired of you being selfish I'm tired of you withh holding I want what's mine praise God let's keep reading let's go on verse 8 for to one is given the spirit of the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work at that one and selfsame spirit dividing to every man severly as he will you don't have a gift because you were super special God is just divided severly as he will you know brother Gabe was talking about the grab bag you didn't listen you didn't decide what gift you were going to have amen that was given to you so you can't take any special pride in it because God gave it to you neither should we use it just for ourselves verse 12 for as the body is one and ha many members and all the members of the one body being many or one body so also is Christ what is Christ he's a many membered body that's what this is telling us for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into the one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it there therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those me MERS of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant cless say what are you talking about brother Chad what's Paul saying it says the height of your cheekbones don't matter just the fact that you got them and your mouth moves what you consider beautiful and you know the shape of your lips who cares as long as you got lips as long as you can suck on a straw when you get a Slurpee you know they function they work we call that beautiful and we pay attention to that but I mean I'm pretty sure my pancreas is pretty nasty looking but it's pretty important brother Bram said this I he goes the success of these meetings is because there's two sisters way back in the wilderness praying the Unseen part the part that's not glorious the part that doesn't get a lot of attention the part where people pray in the night and come here on Saturday evenings and pray for the service on Sunday amen it might get noticed just about as much as your pancreas get noticed but you try living one day without your pancreas and see how far you get amen we need the body everybody contributing whether we see it or don't see it we don't see every phone call we don't see every text of encouragement we don't see every prayer amen but those are the things that are keeping us going amen the things that we think are beautiful we could do without right I'm sorry but that some of the Pomp and some of the prestige and some of the visible stuff we could actually do without it but some of those things that we we don't see the love and care for one another the picking each up other when they're down the prayer that we have for one another we don't see it but we cannot make it without that the faith that we have in one another the belief that we have the pull on the word we may not see those things but we have nothing going here without that says in verse 24 for our comely Parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacketh you do without a part for a minute you do without one and you realize boy I missed that I preached this up in British Columbia and I told him about my teeth you know I got lots of teeth I don't know how many adults have teeth is there a dental hygienist here where's Amy Preston she would know how many teeth is an adult suppos I don't know but in the back right Muller I don't have one anymore cuz I went to the dentist and my tooth was cracked and the dentist says I can put a crown on it and I said how much he said $2,000 and he says or I can pull it for 50 bucks well for me that's a no-brainer I had no dental insurance I was like just yank it out there how fast can you get it going and I thought I got plenty of teeth I'll chew on the right side you know every time I get a corner of a Dorito sideways I about come out of my skin and it doesn't happen all the time but every time it happens I wish I had that tooth and I wish ID pay $2,000 for a crown we bestow much more honor to that which lack it what if we showed up to church and we didn't have a single piano player it may not get noticed cuz it's always there it's always there but the day it's not there is the day you realize hey we need something we don't have a song leader we don't have musician we don't have anybody running sound we don't have anybody that unlock the doors you know we all need one another and the point is anytime we start to miss one another there's the lack and all of a sudden that becomes the most important part praise God verse 25 that there should be no Schism in the body God has set this up that we absolutely need one another so that we won't learn to do without one another that there'll be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all members Rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers no we don't all do everything I love this you know sometimes we hear preaching on the gifts we need the gifts and do we need the gifts we need the gifts the gift should be in the church the gift should never leave the church we need gifts in the church but I wonder how time when people get really fired up preaching about the gifts in the church nobody starts going through helps we need Holy Ghost helps in the church amen and if you don't have helps in the church you're not the right kind of church if we're going to promote gifts let's promote them all if we're going to want them let's want them all not just the comely ones let's have all of them amen everything God has given there's helps there's governments there's all of these things there's giving there's those are all gifts that are mentioned in the bible amen how come nobody's screaming about helps what we need is helps in the church we need governments in the church we need I think God has put it all and we need all of it we need every part of it we need every holy ghost inspired gift amen some of that is seen some of that is unseen some of it's comely some of it's uncomely some of it's a help some of it's a government and one of the gifts is to rule amen amen somebody's got to be in charge that's a gift of the spirit somebody has to be a helper somebody's got to be a helper there's a gift called Ministry that word ministry is not pull pit Ministry that word ministry means serve somebody's got to serve what are those those are gifts of the Spirit those are gifts in the body there's a part for every single one of us to play so that we can build the body together edifying itself together in love nobody gets to sit this out you can't say well I don't have any gift I don't have an office I don't have a job nobody's asked me to do something what do you mean ask you to do something just do whatever comes to your heart don't sit on your heels waiting to be asked to do something amen have a vision be in prayer amen whatever God gives you to do will be something that you see to do something that'll inspire you to do amen this is not about applying for a job this is not about filling out a resume and trying to find no this is about the spirit of God placing in the body everything it needs am mean we need encouragers we need lovers we need we need people who will care for other people we need somebody who will think of somebody else and make sure that they're in fellowship and not secluded and left alone the body needs so much that none of us are excluded not one of us get to sit this out and none of us free ride and loaf letting everybody else carry the weight no all my body is working together all of my body is here for a purpose and it's all working together together to edify itself is that right my white blood cells my circulation system my heart my pancreas my spleen my fingers my nerve endings whatever my hair follicles backslid but the rest of them are still here for a purpose amen we don't get everything perfect in life I always tell people God only made a few perfect TS in the world and he covered the rest of them with hair praise God there one nice thing about being a preacher is nobody can give you a comeback right now so I'll hear about it later I'm sure I'll get all kinds of texts and emails but praise God no part of my body is extra no part's there just hanging out it's there for a purpose none of us are just here we're here for a purpose that's the fful ministry is here to equip us to serve our purpose not to be our heroes not to pull the wagon while everybody sits in it the officers of the church are not here to be hitch to the wagon and pull it and everybody jumps in and we're on a hay ride no we are all here to serve a part and what's my part I don't know but it's inside of you whatever your part is is already in you and the right occasion at the right time in the right circumstance it'll just pop out and everybody else will know what you're doing and you'll never even realize half the time you're just serving you're just caring you're just doing you're just giving you're just thinking you're just saying and it just comes natural the key is to be plugged into the body to be under the anointing of the five full ministry because that's where you get equipped to do your job be connected to the body under the headship of Christ under the anointing of the fful ministry and then be open to be a joint that supplieth because that's what we're here for praise God we're going to stop there let's all stand let's all stand I don't want to go any further praise God musicians if you'll come amen there was one other visiting family I wanted to welcome but they weren't here at the beginning of service but brother Simon Abbott and his family's here in the back God bless you brother Simon God bless you you're welcome you're here from [Applause] England if you'll remember brother Michael and sister Marian quinland that were here with us a month brother Simon is their Pastor they've come they'll be here for three weeks they're staying with the small family if you want to get with them just talk to uh brother John or sister Jill and get make sure they get plenty of Fellowship amen we want to wear them out and send them back tired amen they just landed in Cleveland I believe it was a couple hours ago and rented a car and drove straight here so we get them fresh praise the lord well God bless you guys you're very welcome we're thankful that you're here we pray you have a wonderful time and let's bow our heads together and thank the Lord dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness to us and God I'm so thankful that you brought me to this generation for a purpose God I don't want to go beyond the curtain of time having been a loafer a tagalong a free riter stand next to an apostle Paul who gave everything stand next to the first church age who suffered persecution and gave all they had all I did was soak up all the blessings I could from everyone else God I pray you'd help all of us to find our place equip us Lord through your ministry and give us the tools that we need to grow to mature to stop being tossed about to come into a place where you can use us to be a joint that supplieth to be a part that can contribute to the edifying of the body together in itself in love Lord I know there's some here I know because I know they're confused about what their part is they're unsure about what they should do I pray God that you'd help them to relax and not to worry but just to give just to give of everything that comes to them to give to Just Surrender to you and open themselves to you and allow themselves to stay connected to the body not to jump in or out not to be here for a couple weeks and gone for a couple weeks that won't work Lord not to only be connected to the body on a Sunday and only connected on the Wednesday but God the church is 24/7 your body is all the time it's not a building it's you Lord and a many membered body God help us as people get beyond their religious Notions and concepts of the church is here at 1695 Stewart Road this isn't the church the church is your people Lord God help us to see ourselves as a a port of contribution a place of giving where you can by your spirit anoint us to bless to help to contribute to give to do to your body God we know that as we're connected that we're connected this body when we give we also receive and the part that I lack my brother has the part that I'm in need of my sister has and I pray you would help us Lord all to give willingly and freely like our natural bodies do to the benefit of all for that's your word Lord forgive us for being selfish forgive us for being lazy help us to stay connected to contribute to love to give of ourselves for the benefit of the rest of the body Lord help us as ministers to be a true fful Ministry Lord God we can't do it in ourselves you never asked us to do it you just asked us to yield so you can do it help us Lord to keep the right attitude towards Ministry both the ministers and the people so that we wouldn't go to the right or to the left we would have respect and honor but we wouldn't we wouldn't put it all in the man but Lord we would see you working through the man may it be a conduit that you use to minister to us may it stay pure cure and may it stay clean in every Minister that's in this church myself and everyone else included may we stay corrected by your spirit and humbled Lord that we would hear your voice and we would never inject ourselves but help us to stay out of the way and let you do through us what you want to do through us for God it's our desire to be what you've called us to be in this age to be your bride you yourself manifested in a many membered body we don't want to do anything to hinder it but we each one now see our responsibility we love you God we ask that you would take us and use us beyond our imaginations beyond our thoughts use us God for your purpose for that's why we're here we ask that you'd help us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you brother oh I will serve thee be because
