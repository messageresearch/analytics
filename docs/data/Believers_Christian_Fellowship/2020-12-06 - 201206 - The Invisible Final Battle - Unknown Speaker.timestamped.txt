[4:27] man let's take our bibles while we're
[4:28] standing and turn to first corinthians
[4:30] chapter 14.
[4:32] brother franco i just put a flash drive
[4:33] in there i have a powerpoint i didn't
[4:35] tell you about brother
[4:37] and it's the only one on the route there
[4:39] so i'll be able to pull it up and i
[4:41] forgot to put a title page on it too so
[4:44] we'll just come up to our first
[4:45] scripture while we're standing let's
[4:47] pull up first corinthians chapter 14.
[4:55] in verse 8.
[5:00] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[5:02] sound
[5:03] who shall prepare himself to battle for
[5:06] if the trumpet given uncertain sound
[5:09] who shall prepare himself to battle and
[5:11] i'd like to talk about the invisible
[5:13] final battle
[5:14] if we could this morning and let's just
[5:16] bow our heads and pray and ask the
[5:18] lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you
[5:20] for your word lord we ask god that you
[5:23] would take
[5:24] this word and you would anoint it lord
[5:26] that you would break it yourself lord
[5:28] and feed it to us from your own hand
[5:31] lord that you would move the man out of
[5:32] the way lord in any mental faculty that
[5:35] would be there
[5:35] that you would just take over lord by
[5:37] your holy spirit
[5:38] and you would operate through a gift if
[5:40] you placed in a vessel
[5:42] and god give us all ears to hear in our
[5:44] heart to perceive all that you would say
[5:46] to us today
[5:47] maybe gain strength more and may we be
[5:49] more fit for service
[5:51] we ask that you would have preeminence
[5:52] and take charge of everything that's
[5:54] said and done
[5:54] that you would drive out every spirit
[5:56] that would try to hinder
[5:58] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[6:01] you can all have your seats i want to
[6:04] read a couple other scriptures before we
[6:05] go to the powerpoint
[6:07] let's turn to revelation chapter 4.
[6:14] revelation chapter 4 and we'll begin at
[6:18] verse 1.
[6:18] we know in revelation chapter 4 john
[6:22] is the type of the church he's coming
[6:23] out of the church ages he just went
[6:25] through laodicea
[6:26] and now he's going to begin this
[6:28] statement in revelation chapter 4 with
[6:30] after this
[6:31] after he'd come through laodicea
[6:34] he says after this i looked and behold a
[6:37] door was open in heaven
[6:39] and the first voice which i heard was as
[6:41] it were of a trumpet
[6:43] talking with me which said come up
[6:45] hither and i will show these things
[6:48] things which must be hereafter
[6:51] amen so we know if a trumpet gives an
[6:54] uncertain sound who can prepare for war
[6:56] because the trumpet brother bam tells us
[6:58] a trumpet blast is a calling forth as an
[7:01] gathering and a calling to war amen
[7:03] we'll get to that in a minute and so if
[7:05] trump gives a certain sound how can one
[7:07] prepare for war if we don't know what
[7:08] the trumpet sound means amen
[7:11] and here we see a door open in heaven
[7:13] and the voice of a trumpet saying come
[7:15] up hither what's he doing he's gathering
[7:18] for war amen let's
[7:22] look at revelation 19.
[7:26] revelation 19.
[7:31] and verse 11 revelation 19
[7:37] and 11. and i saw heaven open and behold
[7:41] a white horse and he that sat upon him
[7:44] now see there again heavens opened again
[7:47] so there's a reason heaven's open amen
[7:50] the the
[7:50] this this is significant that john when
[7:53] he comes out of the
[7:54] uh when he comes out of the church ages
[7:56] he sees a door open in heaven he sees an
[7:58] opening in heaven
[7:59] and a trumpet saying come up here and
[8:01] i'll show you these things that shall be
[8:02] hereafter
[8:03] amen and so john goes up and and john
[8:06] goes and he sees
[8:07] the revelation of one god on the throne
[8:09] the book in his hand the lamb taking the
[8:11] book the opening of the seals
[8:13] and all these things but now we come to
[8:14] revelation 19
[8:16] and we see that heaven's opened amen and
[8:18] it's significant to know that heavens
[8:20] open
[8:21] and when heaven became open
[8:24] and i and i saw heaven open and behold a
[8:27] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[8:29] called
[8:29] faithful and true and in righteousness
[8:32] he does judge and make war
[8:34] so this is all about trumpets heaven
[8:36] opening
[8:37] and war these are all going together
[8:41] and judge and make war his eyes were as
[8:43] a flame of fire and on his head were
[8:45] many crowns
[8:46] and he had a name written that no man
[8:47] knew but he himself
[8:49] and he was clothed with the vesture
[8:50] dipped in blood and his name is
[8:52] called the word of god and the armies
[8:55] which were in heaven followed him upon
[8:57] white horses clothed and find linen
[8:59] white and clean and out of his mouth go
[9:01] with a sharp sword
[9:02] that with it he should smite the nations
[9:05] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[9:06] iron
[9:07] and he treadeth the winepress of the
[9:09] fierceness of wrath of
[9:10] almighty god and he hath on his vesture
[9:13] and on his thigh a name written
[9:15] king of kings and lord of lords
[9:18] amen we know this passage of scripture
[9:20] quite well
[9:22] and i want to take a look at this amen
[9:25] and i'll just
[9:26] tell you what i'm looking at right now
[9:27] and just share with you what i'm seeing
[9:29] and i hope you'll just give me that
[9:30] liberty to share with you what i'm
[9:32] seeing
[9:32] because what we see is constantly
[9:34] growing it's evolving we're seeing it
[9:36] more clearly all the time
[9:38] as god gives us more revelation on the
[9:40] message and we see it
[9:41] i mean we've seen it before but now god
[9:44] keeps dialing it in and it's getting
[9:45] clear and clear and clear and clear
[9:48] and as god does it i just want to share
[9:50] with you what i'm seeing and what i'm
[9:52] seeing is that there's a spiritual
[9:53] aspect to the battle of armageddon and
[9:56] i'm not denying anything about the
[9:58] physical there's and there's no
[9:59] when i say that i'd no ways am i taking
[10:01] one or the other amen because we know
[10:03] that the principles in god
[10:05] are true that he does things both
[10:06] spiritually and naturally
[10:08] the word of god and prophecies and such
[10:10] have a spiritual fulfillment
[10:11] and a natural fulfillment amen so
[10:15] so when i say that i'm looking at a
[10:16] spiritual fulfillment of the battle of
[10:18] armageddon the final battle
[10:20] the invisible battle i'm not denying
[10:22] that there won't be a gathering in
[10:24] israel and there won't be a destruction
[10:26] of the armies there
[10:27] and the physical means i believe that
[10:28] with all my heart but i believe god
[10:31] works spiritually
[10:32] and naturally and i want to lay that
[10:34] foundation now right now through this
[10:36] powerpoint
[10:37] i if you'll just give me a minute and be
[10:39] patient i want to go through several
[10:40] scriptures
[10:41] and i just want to show what i'm looking
[10:45] at
[10:45] here in the fact that that god the
[10:48] invisible is more real than the visible
[10:52] and we're trained all our lives opposite
[10:54] of that
[10:55] like everything in us as human beings
[10:57] with with a a carnal spirit of the world
[11:00] with a with this body that we have
[11:02] growing up amen we start to
[11:04] we start to value the tangible and the
[11:06] scene and that becomes real to us like
[11:08] we'll say this desk is real
[11:11] this this suit is real and all this is
[11:13] real but i'd like to venture to say that
[11:15] this is not real this is a reflection of
[11:17] the real amen but there's another more
[11:19] real if i could say it that way or a
[11:21] really real amen
[11:23] but this life is the vapor this is the
[11:25] mist this is the
[11:26] negative that's the positive amen all
[11:28] these things that brother branham told
[11:30] us in the scripture says
[11:31] that we we have to realize that the
[11:33] unseen is
[11:34] more real than the scene
[11:38] amen then if we could bring up the
[11:40] powerpoint
[11:42] and if we look at hebrews 11 1-3 it says
[11:46] now faith is the substance of things
[11:48] hoped for the evidence of things not
[11:49] seen
[11:50] for by it the elders obtained a good
[11:52] report though through faith we
[11:54] understand that the worlds were framed
[11:56] by the word of god
[11:57] so that things which are seen were not
[11:59] made of things which do appear
[12:02] so god in the beginning brother venom
[12:05] tells us that god had faith in his own
[12:07] word and god would speak his word
[12:09] and he would make the things that we now
[12:11] see out of things that do not appear
[12:14] so we didn't take substance that we see
[12:17] and
[12:17] and create and frame the world he took
[12:19] something that we have not seen
[12:21] and he made the world with it so what's
[12:25] more real
[12:26] what's more real is it the world that we
[12:29] see
[12:30] or the unseen material that he made it
[12:32] out of
[12:33] what is the greater reality what has a
[12:35] stronger what is a stronger substance
[12:37] amen
[12:38] what is it and without faith we can
[12:40] never see
[12:41] this other dimension this other world
[12:43] this other reality
[12:44] because it says by faith is the
[12:46] substance of things hoped for
[12:47] the evidence of things not seen the only
[12:50] evidence you have the only substance you
[12:52] have
[12:52] of whatever it is that god made this
[12:54] world out of the only connection you
[12:56] have to that is faith
[12:58] faith is the substance of things hoped
[13:01] for the evidence of things not seen
[13:03] amen because you're not going to find
[13:05] any evidence here
[13:08] your evidence will be your faith through
[13:11] faith we understand that the worlds were
[13:12] framed by the word of god
[13:14] so that things which are seen were not
[13:16] made of things which do appear
[13:19] praise be to god ii corinthians 4
[13:22] while we look not on the things which
[13:24] are seen but of the things which are not
[13:26] seen for the things which are seen are
[13:28] temporal
[13:29] but the things which are not seen are
[13:31] eternal
[13:33] same principle so uh we'll just
[13:36] we're just going to keep going i don't
[13:38] want to do too much explaining
[13:39] brother ben says in supersense cast down
[13:41] the reasonings of these senses believe
[13:43] the supersense the sense of faith
[13:45] that jesus christ gives by that same
[13:47] sense god spoke when there was nothing
[13:50] what is that sense the supersense is god
[13:53] the faith of god
[13:54] in you amen this is the same faith god
[13:57] had
[13:58] the faith of god in you the part of god
[14:01] that comes into you gives you the super
[14:03] sense
[14:03] by that same super sense god framed the
[14:06] world together with things which was not
[14:08] and did not appear he spoke his word and
[14:11] believed his word
[14:12] and the world shook into existence
[14:16] so the faith of god friends the faith of
[14:19] god
[14:20] was to speak when there was nothing to
[14:23] be seen
[14:24] and to believe the spoken word that come
[14:26] from the mouth of god
[14:27] amen and that faith in that that's the
[14:30] faith of god
[14:31] to believe before the manifestation
[14:35] to believe amen to believe while we're
[14:37] waiting for the manifestation to believe
[14:39] before what's spoken moves into the
[14:42] manifestation he said let there be light
[14:44] and he said it may have been it may have
[14:45] been millions of years it may have been
[14:47] how many ever
[14:48] years before that the light appeared on
[14:50] the earth amen but god spoke it he
[14:52] didn't second guess it he believed it
[14:54] and he sat there and he let the word do
[14:56] the work but he was real to him it was
[14:58] tangible
[14:59] he knew that when he said it it would
[15:01] happen he didn't have to see
[15:02] something to believe it he believed it
[15:05] and that's the faith of god that comes
[15:07] into us the supersense to be able to
[15:09] believe in things that we do not see
[15:14] this is an important principle without
[15:16] this
[15:17] amen we're just going to fall flat and
[15:19] never get anywhere in the kingdom of god
[15:21] and we'll never understand the message
[15:25] if we need things that are tangible
[15:27] visible evidences
[15:28] scientific proofs uh uh things that you
[15:31] can
[15:31] you can you can write down and see and
[15:34] prove you'll never believe the message
[15:40] hebrews 11 but without faith it is
[15:43] impossible to please him for he that
[15:45] cometh to god must believe that he is
[15:47] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[15:48] diligently seek him
[15:50] by faith noah being warned of god of
[15:52] things not seen as yet mood with fear
[15:54] prepared an ark
[15:55] this is the faith of god god said it
[15:58] noah believed it and he put his whole
[15:59] life into working for it
[16:01] all of his reputation his resources
[16:04] everything
[16:04] went to preparing an ark why because he
[16:06] believed in things that had not yet
[16:08] appeared that he did not yet see but god
[16:10] told him
[16:14] amen romans 4 therefore it is of faith
[16:18] that it might be by grace to the end the
[16:20] promise might be sure to all the seed
[16:22] not that only which is of the law but to
[16:24] that also which is of the faith of
[16:26] abraham
[16:26] who is the father of us all as it is
[16:29] written as
[16:30] it is written i have made thee a father
[16:32] of many nations before him
[16:34] whom he believed even god who quickeneth
[16:37] the dead
[16:38] and calleth those things which be not as
[16:40] though they were
[16:42] abraham had this same faith that noah
[16:44] had the same faith that god had
[16:46] to where he could call the things which
[16:48] are not as though they were
[16:51] and the bride has the same faith
[16:54] by the new birth amen the bride has the
[16:56] same faith by the quickening of the
[16:58] seats she has the faith of god
[17:00] to be able to declare things that are
[17:02] not seen but they are
[17:04] real calleth those things
[17:07] which be not as though they were
[17:11] i wanna just keep going through
[17:14] scripture i put this on the powerpoint
[17:15] so i could go fast so we don't have to
[17:16] do a lot of flipping
[17:17] because i'm just laying a foundation
[17:20] genesis 17
[17:21] 1 and when abram was 90 years old and
[17:24] nine the lord appeared to abram and said
[17:26] unto him i am the almighty god walk
[17:27] before me
[17:28] and be thou perfect and i will make my
[17:31] covenant between me
[17:32] and thee and i will multiply thee
[17:34] exceedingly
[17:35] and abram fell on his face and god
[17:36] talked with him saying
[17:38] as for me behold my covenant is with
[17:40] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[17:42] nations neither shall thy name
[17:44] any born be called abram but thy name
[17:46] shall be abraham for a father of many
[17:48] nations have i made thee
[17:50] and i will make the exceeding fruitful
[17:52] and i will make nations of thee and
[17:54] kings
[17:55] shall come out of thee and i will
[17:58] establish my covenant between me and
[18:00] thee
[18:00] and thy seed after thee in their
[18:02] generations for an everlasting covenant
[18:05] to be a god unto thee unto thy seed
[18:07] after thee
[18:08] and i will give unto thee unto thy seed
[18:10] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[18:12] stranger
[18:12] all the land of canaan for an
[18:14] everlasting possession
[18:16] and i will be their god and god said
[18:19] unto abram thou shalt keep my covenant
[18:20] therefore
[18:21] thou and thy seed after thee in their
[18:23] generations this is my covenant which
[18:25] you shall keep
[18:26] between me and you and thy seed after
[18:28] thee every man child among you shall be
[18:30] circumcised
[18:32] and you shall circumcise the flesh of
[18:33] your foreskin and it shall be a token
[18:35] of the covenant betwixt me and you
[18:39] i read this and there's a there's a
[18:41] deliberate reason because now when god's
[18:43] giving the promise to abraham
[18:45] he's coming down and he's changing him
[18:47] from abram to abraham and he's
[18:49] he's confirming the covenant with him
[18:50] and he's given him this promise
[18:52] and the promise is i will be with thee
[18:54] and with thy seed after thee
[18:57] and i will i will make you exceedingly
[18:59] fruitful there'll be many that come from
[19:01] you
[19:01] and he says i will give you this land
[19:04] amen and
[19:05] as a seal as a token as an evidence of
[19:07] this circumcision
[19:08] i give you as a token of this a covenant
[19:12] i give you
[19:12] the seal of circumcision but we know
[19:16] that we are children of abraham and part
[19:18] of this seed
[19:20] is that true we are part of this seed so
[19:23] there's a
[19:24] there's a natural seed of abraham but
[19:25] there's a spiritual seed of abraham
[19:27] and there's there's applications in the
[19:30] promises for both
[19:33] because the the natural seed of abraham
[19:35] would take a natural piece of real
[19:37] estate
[19:38] and they would get a natural token a
[19:40] natural seal of the covenant which would
[19:42] be a natural circumcision
[19:44] things that they could touch and stand
[19:46] on they could stand on the promise they
[19:48] could possess the promise
[19:50] i mean they could physically see the
[19:52] evidence of the token
[19:53] which was circumcision but that promise
[19:57] wasn't just for the natural this promise
[20:00] to abraham was also spiritual
[20:02] to the faith seed of abraham who would
[20:04] also get a land would get an inheritance
[20:06] which is the word
[20:08] they would also get a token a ceiling of
[20:10] their covenant which would be the
[20:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[20:13] and when it come to the faith seed to
[20:14] the spiritual seed of abraham
[20:16] they wouldn't have anything tangible to
[20:18] stand on to hold on to possess
[20:20] or anything physical to look at to see
[20:22] the evidence of the token
[20:23] what they would have would be a
[20:24] spiritual reality of this natural type
[20:28] and this is the gentile way
[20:31] this is clearly the gentile way the
[20:34] gentile way is how to have the faith of
[20:36] god
[20:37] amen to be able to declare things that
[20:39] are not yet seen
[20:41] to be able to declare the spiritual
[20:43] reality
[20:44] though there's no physical evidence as a
[20:47] way of a token
[20:48] amen if you say i have the token the
[20:50] baptism the holy ghost i say show it to
[20:52] me amen an israelite could show you
[20:54] physically on his body amen that he was
[20:57] under circumcision amen but we come
[20:59] under circumcision which is the
[21:00] circumcision of the heart
[21:02] amen and it's deep on the inside and
[21:04] it's not something you could show to
[21:05] somebody
[21:06] it has a manifestation absolutely the
[21:08] manifestation is a changed life
[21:10] and obedience to the word but the
[21:12] physical mark the physical cutting away
[21:15] of the fleshly heart you can't show it
[21:17] it's a spiritual reality
[21:21] and like i said this is the face seat of
[21:23] abraham and this
[21:24] is the gentile way and don't forget
[21:27] we're gentiles
[21:29] seed of abraham royal seed of abraham
[21:35] galatians 3 28 there is neither jew nor
[21:38] greek there is neither bond nor free
[21:39] there is neither male nor female for
[21:41] you're all one in christ jesus
[21:43] and if you're a christ and you're
[21:44] abraham's seed in air according to the
[21:46] promise
[21:48] you're heir to everything that we just
[21:50] read in genesis that abraham would give
[21:52] but how am i heir to it go go over to
[21:54] canaan i mean go over to palestine now
[21:56] and take you a piece of land
[22:01] show me the seal of your of your of your
[22:03] of your token and your circumcision
[22:05] you see it's not we're heirs of the
[22:07] promise amen but the
[22:08] to us they're the spiritual realities
[22:11] that the natural things were typing
[22:13] they were showing in a natural way
[22:15] foreshadowing
[22:16] what was coming foreshadowing what was
[22:18] the spiritual reality for us
[22:22] we are abraham's seed and heirs
[22:23] according to the promise
[22:27] romans 2 for he is not jew which is one
[22:30] outwardly neither is that circumcision
[22:32] which is outwardly in the flesh
[22:33] but he is a jew which is one inwardly in
[22:35] circumcision as that of the heart
[22:37] in the spirit and not in the letter
[22:39] whose praise is not a men but of god
[22:43] he's telling his circumcision is not the
[22:44] natural circumcision the circumcision is
[22:46] the circumcision of the heart
[22:48] and paul now the apostle paul is coming
[22:51] here
[22:52] amen and he's the light and to the
[22:54] gentiles he's he's the he's the uh
[22:56] the prophet of the first church age the
[22:58] first church age messenger he's here to
[23:00] bring the gospel truth the new and
[23:01] living way
[23:02] to the gentiles and when he brings it to
[23:04] the gentiles he brings it as a spiritual
[23:07] reality in a spiritual fulfillment of
[23:09] the natural that was to the jews
[23:11] the natural to israel and so we want to
[23:14] we want to know these things i know we
[23:16] know these things but i just want to
[23:17] review these things so that we know them
[23:19] because in in paul's day these were
[23:21] humongous statements
[23:23] like now when we when we look at this
[23:26] amen and we're like yeah of course
[23:27] obviously but when paul was making this
[23:29] statement when he would go into the
[23:31] synagogue
[23:32] and then he would begin to say this amen
[23:33] they they i would
[23:35] they would they were blowing gaskets
[23:36] there was fuses circuits were melting
[23:38] down
[23:38] because how can you do away with
[23:40] circumcision circumcision is our
[23:42] our mark it's our token it's our seal
[23:44] the covenant and if i'm circumcised
[23:46] and i'm a seed of abraham i'm part of
[23:48] that promise and he's saying no no no
[23:50] that was only a shadow of what's coming
[23:52] now and what's coming now is a spiritual
[23:54] reality
[23:54] to be an heir of all things i mean that
[23:57] god to be your father amen
[23:59] to possess his word amen to receive the
[24:02] word as your possession amen
[24:04] and their token is the circumcision of
[24:06] the heart amen and they were having a
[24:07] meltdown
[24:08] because they had the natural the natural
[24:10] the natural and we're holding on to the
[24:12] natural and he was telling them
[24:13] that if you want to move further you
[24:15] have to let go of the natural
[24:17] and take take a hold of the spiritual
[24:22] and who was saying that the apostle paul
[24:25] who is spiritualizing the word the
[24:28] apostle paul
[24:30] who is he spiritualizing it for the
[24:32] gentiles
[24:37] praise god
[24:41] hebrews 12 apostle paul again if you're
[24:43] not coming to the mount that might be
[24:45] touched
[24:46] that burn with fire nor into blackness
[24:48] and darkness and tempest
[24:49] he's saying you're not coming to mount
[24:50] sinai we're not going back to the
[24:53] physical mountain that you can touch
[24:56] and the fire that you can see and the
[24:58] blackness and the burning and the
[25:00] shaking the earthquake
[25:01] you're not coming to that because you
[25:03] you are now uh
[25:04] royal seed face seed spiritual seed of
[25:07] abraham
[25:08] you're coming to something that's more
[25:10] real
[25:11] than mount sinai
[25:16] you're not coming to the blackness and
[25:18] darkness and tempest and the sound of a
[25:20] trumpet and the voice of words which
[25:21] voice they heard
[25:22] and treated and the words should not be
[25:24] spoken to them anymore
[25:26] for they could not endure that which was
[25:27] commanded and if so much as a beast
[25:29] touched the mountain it should be stoned
[25:30] or thrust through with a dart
[25:32] so terrible was the sight that moses
[25:34] said i exceedingly fear and quake
[25:37] but you are coming to mount zion unto
[25:39] the city of the living god
[25:42] paul is saying we're not going back to
[25:45] the wilderness i'm not taking you back
[25:47] there
[25:48] but we're moving forward and you've
[25:51] come to mount zion
[25:55] where where where did we come to mount
[25:57] zion when did we walk up to it when do
[25:59] we scale the mountain
[26:00] wherever you were amen wherever the
[26:03] gentiles were
[26:04] whether it was in rome or asia minor or
[26:06] wherever he was
[26:08] amen they had come to mount zion because
[26:10] it was not a
[26:11] physical location on the earth amen it
[26:13] was a position in christ it was a
[26:14] spiritual reality
[26:16] they were coming to mount zion they were
[26:18] coming amen they were coming to mount
[26:20] zion
[26:21] unto the city of the living god amen
[26:24] they had come
[26:25] to the city of the living god and they
[26:26] were in corinth and they were in athens
[26:28] and they were i mean they were
[26:30] in laodicea and they were wherever they
[26:33] were they were coming to the city of god
[26:35] and then they were walking through a
[26:36] physical city in
[26:37] asia minor they were walking through a
[26:39] physical city in the south of europe
[26:41] they were walking through a physical
[26:42] place in syria
[26:44] and then as they were walking in antioch
[26:46] amenity says you've not come to antioch
[26:48] your physical being is an antioch but
[26:50] you have come into the city of god
[26:59] and there was believers in that day that
[27:00] believed paul
[27:02] and said i have come to mount zion and i
[27:05] am in the city of god
[27:08] and there is nothing that they could see
[27:13] touch no headquarters to go to no place
[27:17] that they could say now this is the city
[27:19] i'll go in there and this is the
[27:21] mountain i'll climb up there
[27:24] only faith will put you on that mountain
[27:29] and only faith will put you in that city
[27:33] to realize it's a reality
[27:40] the city of the living god the heavenly
[27:41] jerusalem into an innumerable company of
[27:43] angels
[27:45] to the general assembly in the church of
[27:46] the firstborn
[27:50] which is written in heaven and to god
[27:52] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[27:54] just men made perfect
[27:55] and to jesus the mediator the new
[27:57] covenant to the blood of sprinkling
[27:59] that speaketh better things than that of
[28:01] abel
[28:03] all of these things paul is presenting
[28:06] as spiritual realities that they have
[28:07] come to
[28:08] now not in the future but now
[28:12] you've come to this mountain you've come
[28:14] to this city you've come to the
[28:15] sprinkling of blood you've come to an
[28:17] innumerable company of angels
[28:19] you're surrounded by angels you've come
[28:21] to the general assembly in church of the
[28:23] firstborn
[28:24] amen you've come to the uh to the judge
[28:27] of all and the spirits of just men made
[28:29] perfect you've come to this you're in
[28:31] this place
[28:31] you're caught up in heavenly places in
[28:33] christ jesus and you don't even know it
[28:35] you don't even realize it but there was
[28:36] people there with faith that said
[28:38] i believe what he's saying that's the
[28:40] truth something in me resonates and said
[28:42] that's my position
[28:43] that's where i'm at that's where i
[28:45] belong
[28:46] and see paul was not paul was not
[28:49] pointing to a location
[28:50] and telling them how to get there he was
[28:52] not telling them to strive for this
[28:53] place
[28:54] he was telling them you've come to this
[28:56] place if you've come in christ amen
[28:58] christ is in you and you're a christ
[28:59] you're
[29:00] in this place this is the reality of
[29:02] where you've come this is your position
[29:05] and there's nothing they could see touch
[29:08] feel smell
[29:09] here it was all spiritual realities
[29:16] apostle paul again in ephesians 6
[29:18] finally my brethren be strong in the
[29:20] lord
[29:21] and the power of his might put on the
[29:24] whole armor of god
[29:25] and we're going to we're going to labor
[29:27] on this for a minute
[29:30] before i get to this i want to back them
[29:31] and just show paul was the one who told
[29:33] us
[29:34] that the tabernacle in the wilderness
[29:36] was a shadow of a real one
[29:42] that's why amen that's why
[29:45] when they would be cast out of the
[29:47] temple or the temple would fall flat
[29:50] it wasn't a problem amen because that
[29:52] one was only showing the real one it was
[29:54] a shadow
[29:55] and if the shadow would collapse it's no
[29:57] problem because by faith it entered into
[29:59] the real one
[30:01] because christ had went behind the veil
[30:03] and they are seated in heavenly places
[30:05] in christ jesus behind the veil
[30:08] so if the one on earth would collapse to
[30:10] the christians
[30:11] amen it was okay amen because that that
[30:14] was only
[30:15] showing a reflection of that one there
[30:17] but by faith when christ entered in
[30:19] behind that veil if i'm a part of christ
[30:21] i entered behind that veil and i have
[30:23] access to the throne of god i no longer
[30:25] need to come to this
[30:26] access point here that accessed that
[30:28] point because by christ christ i went
[30:30] behind the veil
[30:31] direct access to the throne of god
[30:34] and what a spiritual reality no more a
[30:36] form of going and taking a
[30:38] a offering and a priest there who would
[30:40] slay it and a blood on a physical altar
[30:43] and carrying it in amen to the holy
[30:45] place and the lighting of candles
[30:47] all of that was showing amen what was
[30:49] the reality and this is the shadow
[30:51] until christ opened up the way into the
[30:53] reality the only way to touch the
[30:55] reality was through the shadow
[30:59] but when god opened up the way to the
[31:01] reality he could do away with the shadow
[31:04] amen and the temple was was was rendered
[31:07] flat
[31:08] and then decimated because god didn't
[31:11] need it for his children anymore to
[31:12] contact him
[31:13] they could contact directly through
[31:14] christ
[31:17] spiritual realities when the temple fell
[31:21] it was a mourning through israel it was
[31:23] devastation but for the christians
[31:26] there was something greater that had
[31:28] opened up
[31:29] a greater reality not that they could
[31:31] see it not that they could touch it
[31:33] not that they could take anybody to it
[31:34] and say here's the way here's the temple
[31:36] see it do you see this just walk this
[31:38] way
[31:40] it was all revealed it was all by faith
[31:44] now paul comes and he he tells us also
[31:47] the law was a shadow
[31:50] the temple was a shadow the law was a
[31:52] shadow the feast days and new moons and
[31:54] sabbath they were a shadow
[31:56] and when paul's paul was directing them
[31:58] away from the feast days
[32:01] away from amen keeping of the ordinances
[32:04] for a way to meet god but now he's
[32:06] saying
[32:06] that law was a shadow of things to come
[32:09] those feast days and new moons and holy
[32:11] days
[32:12] all they were was a shadow of things to
[32:14] come now we've moved into the reality of
[32:16] those things
[32:19] and that's why the jews wanted to stone
[32:21] paul and had to kill him
[32:22] because paul amen they saw paul
[32:25] as destroying the law of moses
[32:29] they saw paul as a perverter of the law
[32:31] of moses
[32:32] and they didn't realize by holding on to
[32:35] the tangible
[32:36] they were the perverter of the law of
[32:40] moses
[32:42] this is a principle amen this is a key
[32:45] to
[32:46] understanding amen by by holding on
[32:49] by holding on to that old way amen and
[32:52] preventing people from coming to the new
[32:54] and living way
[32:55] they were perverting the law of moses
[32:57] because the law of moses
[32:58] was to bring them to christ
[33:02] and now all of those things that the
[33:05] jews had that were tangible they could
[33:07] see and touch and feel
[33:09] now those were no longer necessary
[33:13] because now by the way of faith they can
[33:16] move to the real things
[33:18] not the shadows see that's so
[33:22] sometimes so awkward to say as a human
[33:25] being
[33:26] that that i we no longer need we don't
[33:29] no longer need sticks and stones and
[33:31] building materials
[33:32] we don't need this stuff anymore now we
[33:34] can move to the real stuff
[33:37] what real stuff show it to me i can't
[33:39] show it to me
[33:40] where is it it's here where is it at
[33:43] it's here
[33:43] where are you and seated in heavenly
[33:45] places in christ jesus but you're
[33:47] standing there
[33:48] no i'm seated in heavenly places in
[33:49] christ jesus well where is christ he's
[33:51] well he's in me
[33:54] but you said you were there seated with
[33:55] him and he's in me
[33:57] it's all the same thing friends it's the
[33:59] reality it's all around us amen christ
[34:02] has come to unite with his bride they
[34:04] have become one where he is she is amen
[34:06] where she is he
[34:07] is and it's not we don't measure it
[34:11] anymore by time and space and
[34:13] distance and all the things on this
[34:14] earth that we measure things by
[34:16] it's not first and next and last and
[34:18] then and before it's all eternity
[34:21] it's moved into the eternity it's not
[34:24] here and there it's not now here and
[34:27] then there
[34:27] amen christ in his bride is united but
[34:29] the uniting of the word is united christ
[34:31] and his bride together
[34:32] they're becoming one whatever she is he
[34:35] is whatever he is she
[34:36] is
[34:40] but you can't see it it's like the wind
[34:43] you can see the effect of it but you
[34:45] can't see it
[34:46] you can see the effect of that union in
[34:48] people's lives but you can't see
[34:50] it you can only see it by faith
[34:54] by faith is what makes it a reality
[34:58] this is god's plan for making sure that
[35:00] it only goes to the seed
[35:03] that not everybody picks it up because
[35:05] it it can't be
[35:06] intellectually acquired because it
[35:09] defies
[35:10] our intellect
[35:13] now paul is telling us how to be a
[35:16] soldier
[35:17] and we're going to talk about the the
[35:19] final invisible battle
[35:21] now let's talk about being this soldier
[35:24] a gentile soldier
[35:25] a warrior he said put on the whole armor
[35:28] of god
[35:29] that ye may be able to stand against the
[35:30] wiles of the devil
[35:32] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[35:33] blood but against principalities against
[35:35] powers
[35:36] against the rulers of the darkness of
[35:38] this world against spiritual wickedness
[35:39] in high places
[35:41] wherefore taken to you the hormone of
[35:43] god so he's making it really clear
[35:46] that you're not fighting anything
[35:48] physical on this earth
[35:51] you're not fighting a government a law
[35:53] you're not fighting
[35:54] anything physical in this earth you are
[35:56] not you we wrestle not against flesh and
[35:59] blood but against principalities against
[36:01] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[36:02] this world
[36:03] against spiritual wickedness and high
[36:05] places that word means
[36:06] heavenly spiritual wickedness in
[36:10] heavenly places amen and so now we are
[36:13] not
[36:13] fighting an earthly battle the battle is
[36:16] on earth in
[36:16] us but it's not an earthly battle it's a
[36:19] heavenly battle with heavenly forces
[36:21] but the battle is taking place in the
[36:23] mind of man
[36:25] but it's still a heavenly battle we're
[36:27] not warring against flesh and blood
[36:29] i'll put it this way the only flesh and
[36:31] blood that you're fighting is yours
[36:34] don't fight in the other the only flesh
[36:36] and blood you that you wrestle with is
[36:38] the one that you look at in the mirror
[36:40] every morning
[36:41] after that there's no more wrestling
[36:43] with flesh and blood it's all spiritual
[36:47] now that spiritual may have
[36:49] manifestations amen you may see the
[36:51] effect of the spiritual
[36:53] all around you may come as a sickness it
[36:55] may come as somebody
[36:57] shouting angry curse words at you that's
[36:59] the manifestation but it's not that
[37:01] flesh and blood
[37:02] it's the spirit that's behind it that
[37:04] we're at war with
[37:06] you understand it may be governments
[37:08] that change laws
[37:09] amen that put restrictions and make
[37:11] things difficult amen but
[37:13] that's not the force we're fighting amen
[37:15] we're fighting the force that's beyond
[37:17] that
[37:17] because we have no power in the flesh to
[37:20] overcome
[37:21] those forces tell me what you're going
[37:24] to do
[37:25] against the government tell me what
[37:28] you're going to do when
[37:29] they knock on your door and they show up
[37:31] and man what if a tank pulls up your
[37:33] driveway what are you going to do
[37:34] what are you going to do roll up your
[37:35] sleeves
[37:38] if we fight flesh and blood we're going
[37:39] to lose and when we realize
[37:41] no no there's something in me that's
[37:44] eternal
[37:44] there's something in me that's been
[37:46] quickened by the spirit of god
[37:47] amen that's heavenly that's in a
[37:49] heavenly dimension that has access to
[37:51] the throne of god
[37:53] there's more to me than the flesh and
[37:55] blood so i'm going to drop the flesh and
[37:57] blood
[37:58] and not fight flesh and blood with flesh
[38:00] and blood amen but i'm going to take
[38:01] this to a higher level because when we
[38:03] go to
[38:04] a higher level i have a different
[38:06] authority altogether
[38:07] i have a different position and a
[38:09] different power because what's been
[38:10] given to me
[38:12] amen by my lord amen has been given to
[38:14] me authority over scorpions and serpents
[38:16] and all the power of the devil
[38:20] so if we keep it in flesh and blood we
[38:23] lose
[38:25] if we make it about our spouse and we
[38:27] make it about
[38:28] we make it about these symptoms and we
[38:30] make it about this employer
[38:32] or this this this government power
[38:34] whatever
[38:35] if you make it about that you will lose
[38:38] but if you go to the next level higher
[38:40] and you say this is
[38:41] not about the symptom it's about the
[38:43] devil that's creating the symptom
[38:45] this is not about the angry neighbors
[38:47] about the devil that's influencing him
[38:48] it's not about the government about the
[38:50] devil that's in control and i'm going to
[38:52] resist
[38:53] that devil and not resist that flesh
[38:58] this is how this is how
[39:03] the saints of god fight
[39:06] you have to know who your enemy is where
[39:08] your enemy is
[39:09] and stop beating the air fight the good
[39:13] fight of faith
[39:14] according to the word verse 13 says
[39:17] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[39:18] of god that you may be able to withstand
[39:20] the evil day
[39:21] and having done all to stand stand
[39:23] therefore having your loins girded about
[39:25] with truth
[39:26] and having on the breastplate of
[39:27] righteousness and your feet shod with
[39:30] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[39:32] above all taking the shield of faith
[39:34] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[39:35] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[39:37] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[39:39] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[39:41] god
[39:42] praying always with all prayer and
[39:43] supplication in the spirit and watching
[39:45] their there unto with all
[39:47] perseverance and supplication for all
[39:49] saints
[39:51] now we've got the armor but if you look
[39:55] the armor does nothing to protect your
[39:58] flesh
[40:03] this armor that we've been given is not
[40:04] a fleshly battle
[40:06] we don't war against flesh and blood
[40:08] it's not a fleshly battle there may be a
[40:10] manifestation in the flesh but the
[40:12] battle
[40:12] is in heavenly places with
[40:14] principalities and powers
[40:16] rulers of darkness
[40:19] and so when we when we drop down to the
[40:22] flesh and carnal understanding
[40:24] we dropped back to the revelation of the
[40:26] jews
[40:28] who wanted to make jesus as a king and
[40:30] throw out the romans and fight the flesh
[40:34] but jesus says my kingdom is not of this
[40:36] world
[40:38] in my kingdom of this world my subjects
[40:40] would fight
[40:42] but there's a different kingdom that
[40:44] he's interested in
[40:46] so now we look at the the weapons of our
[40:49] warfare we look at the
[40:50] armament that we're given the only
[40:52] offensive weapon we're given is the word
[40:54] amen
[40:55] and the defensive weapon are all
[40:56] defenses and spiritual realms it's not
[40:59] physical these things do not protect our
[41:01] physical body
[41:02] and man they protect you spiritually
[41:06] the helmet of salvation amen lauren's
[41:09] great about with truth breastplate of
[41:10] righteousness
[41:11] amen quenching all the fiery darts of
[41:13] the enemy this is not about
[41:15] flesh and blood it's not about
[41:16] protecting our flesh it doesn't mean
[41:18] that we're never going to have trials in
[41:20] the flesh or difficulties in the flesh
[41:21] amen but the armament wasn't given to
[41:23] you to protect your flesh
[41:25] the armament was given to you to win a
[41:26] spiritual war
[41:28] to fight principalities and powers in
[41:29] heavenly places
[41:33] so we want to understand these things
[41:40] modern events make clear by prophecy
[41:43] the prophet of god said there's not one
[41:45] thing that the christian has in his army
[41:46] that's scientific
[41:48] did you know that love joy peace long
[41:50] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[41:52] patience faith
[41:52] holy ghost everything is unseen by
[41:55] science
[41:56] and that's the only thing that's real
[41:58] and lasting
[42:00] everything you look at come from the
[42:01] earth and goes back to the earth but the
[42:03] things that you can't see with your eye
[42:05] but see it declare itself that's the
[42:08] world
[42:09] of the eternal praise
[42:12] be to god that's the world of the
[42:15] eternal
[42:17] jesus says my kingdom is not of this
[42:19] world i just quoted this if my kingdom
[42:21] were of this world then would my
[42:22] servants fight
[42:24] that i should not be delivered to the
[42:25] jews but now is my kingdom not from
[42:28] hence
[42:29] so he's telling us even we're not
[42:31] fighting they weren't fighting to
[42:32] deliver jesus
[42:33] jesus wasn't delivered into the hands of
[42:36] man jesus was delivered into the hands
[42:37] of god
[42:40] jesus knew he jesus knew he could send
[42:43] legions of angels and deliver me he knew
[42:45] he could be delivered he knew
[42:47] amen he knew that that pilate had no
[42:50] authority over him other than what was
[42:51] given of his father
[42:53] so jesus was not caught up in the trial
[42:56] he was not caught up in defending
[42:57] himself and
[42:58] answering their questions or debating he
[43:00] knew what the will of god was the will
[43:02] of god was for him to surrender
[43:03] and go to the cross amen he you you
[43:06] think that jesus did not have the wisdom
[43:09] amen to take those lying witnesses whose
[43:11] testimonies could not
[43:13] uh could not even align do you think
[43:15] jesus didn't have the wisdom and ability
[43:17] to unravel that whole trial
[43:20] you think he couldn't have quoted the
[43:22] law like he did every other time
[43:25] and and leave them dumbfounded without
[43:27] an answer and they stopped asking him
[43:28] questions because he'd always go to the
[43:30] word go to the word go to the word and
[43:32] absolutely destroy their argument
[43:34] do you think he couldn't have unraveled
[43:36] amen that that mock trial he could have
[43:39] unraveled
[43:40] it amen but he wasn't fighting a flesh
[43:42] and blood war this had nothing to do
[43:43] with that
[43:44] this was all a manifestation of
[43:45] something that was going on in a higher
[43:47] realm
[43:47] and god had called him to submit to that
[43:50] amen
[43:51] and all those forces were working
[43:52] against him and he wasn't trying
[43:54] to free himself from calvary he wasn't
[43:56] trying to protect his flesh
[44:00] he was winning a battle he was winning a
[44:02] war he was defeating his enemy but it
[44:04] but it wasn't
[44:05] flesh he was surrendering the flesh
[44:09] so that he could win so we got to get
[44:12] caught up that we don't fight the wrong
[44:14] battles second corinthians 10
[44:18] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[44:20] not war after the flesh
[44:22] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[44:24] carnal but mighty through god to the
[44:25] pulling down
[44:27] of strongholds
[44:30] amen
[44:33] now that's my foundation are we on the
[44:36] foundation together
[44:38] and we're on the foundation we realize
[44:40] that the spiritual realities that are
[44:42] given by faith
[44:43] are the real substance the invisible
[44:47] warfare is the real warfare
[44:50] the the the promises that are given to
[44:53] us
[44:53] are not things that are visible or
[44:55] tangible they're things that are only
[44:57] tangible by faith
[44:58] faith is the substance faith is the
[45:00] evidence
[45:02] and so now i want to move forward in
[45:05] into this
[45:06] with that understanding in the first
[45:10] seal
[45:11] brother brahma he said here's the plan
[45:12] of it we spoke with this a couple
[45:14] sundays ago
[45:15] the first thing happens there is an
[45:16] announcement in the heavens first what
[45:18] happened
[45:19] a seal is opened what is that a mystery
[45:21] is unfolded
[45:22] and when a mystery unfolds then a
[45:24] trumpet sounds it declares a war
[45:27] or a plague falls and a church age opens
[45:29] what is the war part
[45:30] the angel of the church catches the
[45:32] mystery of god not fully yet revealed
[45:34] but when he does he catches this mystery
[45:36] of god and then he goes forth to the
[45:38] people after the mystery has been given
[45:40] to him
[45:41] goes forth to the people what does he do
[45:43] out there he begins to proclaim that
[45:45] message and what does it start a war
[45:47] a spiritual war so brother man was
[45:50] referring to the church ages in every
[45:52] church age amen there was a sounding of
[45:54] a trumpet what was the sounding of a
[45:55] trumpet
[45:56] it would come after the breaking of a
[45:57] seal a revelation from god would be
[45:59] given to a church age messenger
[46:01] that messenger receive it when he begins
[46:03] to bring it to the people
[46:04] he is blowing a trumpet the trumpet does
[46:07] two things it gathers the people to the
[46:09] trumpet
[46:10] and declares war so it's a gathering
[46:14] together
[46:15] of the soldiers that can hear the
[46:17] trumpet and the trumpet doesn't give an
[46:19] uncertain sound
[46:21] because if it gives an uncertain sound
[46:23] how can one prepare for the battle
[46:25] so this trumpet gives a certain sound
[46:27] it's a certain revelation a certain
[46:28] truth
[46:29] amen that's proclaiming and the
[46:30] spiritual war starts over that part
[46:33] of the word and the devil
[46:37] now comes along and he's trying to
[46:39] discredit
[46:40] that truth he's trying to discredit that
[46:43] part of the word
[46:44] he's trying to discredit that word and
[46:47] when he cannot discredit that word
[46:49] he begins to try to destroy the vessels
[46:51] that are carrying the word
[46:53] and if we watch this from church age to
[46:55] church age to church age amen and then
[46:57] when there was laws that would begin to
[46:59] protect the
[47:00] the the individuals carrying the truth
[47:02] from being persecuted and stoned and
[47:04] killed
[47:05] then they would begin to destroy their
[47:07] character
[47:08] or their reputation so that nobody would
[47:10] listen to them
[47:12] it's the same thing it happens over and
[47:14] over
[47:15] and over again through the church ages
[47:17] and now what he's doing he's taking that
[47:19] truth that spiritually revealed truth a
[47:21] seal is open in that age
[47:23] and he takes that truth and declare it
[47:24] is the sounding of a trumpet
[47:26] calling the soldiers to spiritual war
[47:29] amen
[47:30] and the sounding of the trumpet they
[47:31] gather together they begin to proclaim
[47:33] the truth and the enemy starts to fight
[47:35] that truth
[47:36] because that truth is a threat to his
[47:38] kingdom
[47:41] his kingdom is set upon the earth based
[47:43] on deception
[47:44] so truth is always a threat to his
[47:46] kingdom because the foundation of his
[47:48] kingdom
[47:49] is deception the only way that he got
[47:51] squatter rights to sit on the earth as
[47:53] god of this world
[47:54] of god of this evil age and god of this
[47:56] world is because
[47:58] of deception he deceived eve and she was
[48:01] trapped into it
[48:03] so the foundation of his kingdom is
[48:06] deception
[48:08] and truth truth makes him vulnerable
[48:14] the truth is a threat to satan's kingdom
[48:18] so that's why when the truth comes out
[48:20] it always starts spiritual war
[48:23] this has nothing to do with
[48:25] nationalities it has nothing to do with
[48:27] personality type
[48:28] it is all has to do with the spiritual
[48:30] revealed word
[48:34] praise god
[48:38] it goes forth to people it starts a war
[48:40] a spiritual war
[48:42] and then god takes his messenger with
[48:44] the elect of that age and lays them
[48:45] asleep
[48:46] and then he drops a plague upon them who
[48:48] rejects it a temporary judgment
[48:50] then after that is over then he goes on
[48:52] and they denominate
[48:53] and bring in the denominations and start
[48:55] off with that man's work
[48:56] like of wesley and all the rest of them
[48:58] and then it gets all
[49:00] scrappled again and then another mystery
[49:02] comes forth then what happens another
[49:04] messenger arrives on earth for a church
[49:05] hc
[49:07] then when he arrives the trumpet sounds
[49:09] he declares war
[49:10] and and then what happens finally then
[49:13] he's caught away and then he's laid away
[49:17] then plagues fall destroys them
[49:20] spiritual listen
[49:21] oh my goodness spiritual death hits the
[49:24] church
[49:26] and she's gone that group then he goes
[49:28] on to another one
[49:31] the plague follows a temporary judgment
[49:33] but then when it happens spiritual
[49:34] death hits that church that group and he
[49:36] moves to another one
[49:38] so what is following you have a
[49:40] revealing of truth a breaking of a seal
[49:42] a messenger will sound the trumpet it
[49:44] will gather the elect to that truth
[49:46] gather the army
[49:47] and i'll say it like this and just
[49:49] listen to me and just love me anyway
[49:52] when he blows that trumpet he gathers
[49:54] the armies of heaven
[49:58] that are on earth in that day
[50:02] the elect of god when he blows the
[50:05] trumpet he
[50:05] gathers the army of heaven and i hope
[50:09] i hope you can receive that amen in the
[50:11] way that i when the way that i mean it
[50:13] he gathers the army of heaven amen the
[50:15] the the spiritual elect the attributes
[50:18] of god they may come from god go to god
[50:21] only here to serve god's purpose and
[50:23] they're here to declare this truth and
[50:24] fight back the devil's lie
[50:26] and so he's gathering an army from
[50:28] heaven but they're manifested in flesh
[50:31] [Music]
[50:33] amen
[50:38] i don't think god's recruiting a new
[50:40] army
[50:42] god's had his army from before the
[50:44] foundation of the world and then there
[50:45] was an
[50:46] army here that fought and resisted the
[50:48] devil's lie in the beginning and brother
[50:50] bannon said that was you or some portion
[50:51] of you
[50:52] that was there that resisted the devil's
[50:54] lie in the beginning some angel spirit
[50:56] that spun off of god
[50:57] amen and you resisted it what form i
[50:59] don't know i can't mechanically
[51:00] understand it but there's something in
[51:02] me see that's the truth
[51:03] and that army has been coming down
[51:05] through age and age and eight and when
[51:07] that trumpet
[51:08] sounds it's gathering that army in that
[51:10] day back together for spiritual war
[51:12] against the deception
[51:16] of the devil
[51:19] praise be to god i pray that god makes
[51:22] this clear
[51:23] and clear and clear to us because
[51:25] there's realities here there's truths
[51:27] these prophets brought these things he
[51:28] said these things
[51:29] we don't fully comprehend them we can't
[51:31] fully understand them the human mind may
[51:32] never get it but something in my heart
[51:34] says there's a truth there it's ringing
[51:36] solid it's ringing true
[51:40] then spiritual death hits the church oh
[51:43] it's a great plan until he comes to the
[51:45] last angel
[51:47] now he has no certain mystery but he
[51:49] gathers up all that's been lost in them
[51:51] other ages
[51:52] oh man i'll tell you friends if a truth
[51:55] in that
[51:56] age started spiritual war and spiritual
[52:00] war
[52:00] that would rock the church amen would
[52:02] cause a reformation
[52:04] would he even cause political systems to
[52:06] get involved in the church to unite
[52:08] with politics and they would bring about
[52:10] soldiers
[52:11] and they would arrest people and torture
[52:13] them and put them in prison and execute
[52:15] them
[52:16] that's the result of this spiritual war
[52:18] that was
[52:19] that truth in that day that caused that
[52:21] kind of reaction from the enemy
[52:23] what happens when you gather all of
[52:25] those truths from all of those days
[52:27] and gather them into one what kind of
[52:29] war is that going to be
[52:30] i believe it's going to be the war of
[52:32] all wars for the gentile bride
[52:36] because as to all the truths that were
[52:38] lost it's going back to the original
[52:40] amen the original doctrine of the
[52:41] apostles the original thing that was
[52:43] lost
[52:43] the original word in its original form
[52:46] and as that's gathered together and that
[52:48] trumpet sounded
[52:49] amen that's calling together the armies
[52:51] of heaven
[52:54] that are here in this day to hear that
[52:56] trumpet and they're gathering for what
[52:58] purpose
[52:59] for spiritual war because all hell is
[53:01] going to break loose against this
[53:03] revelation
[53:08] amen
[53:13] no he has no certain mystery but he
[53:15] gathers of all has been lost in the
[53:17] mother ages and all the truths that
[53:18] wasn't truly revealed yet
[53:20] as the revelations come then he reveals
[53:22] those things
[53:24] in this day if you want to read it
[53:26] revelation 10
[53:27] 1-4 about four you'll get it all right
[53:30] takes the book
[53:30] the seals and breaks them and shows the
[53:32] seventh angel
[53:34] for this alone the mysteries of god is
[53:36] the ministry of the seventh angel
[53:39] now we just come through the church ages
[53:41] with even history and prove that see
[53:43] it's the
[53:47] oh where where am i
[53:51] oh it's the things that in the past
[53:53] revelation 10 1-7 that's to be
[53:55] now remember in the days of the seventh
[53:58] angel his sounding forth
[53:59] blasting forth the gospel trump and he
[54:02] has to finish
[54:03] all the mysteries of god so
[54:06] what did brother branham do amen he
[54:08] sounded forth to trumpet
[54:10] but what trumpet did he sound he sounded
[54:12] fourth to seventh trumpet
[54:14] the last trumpet and what was contained
[54:16] in that seventh trumpet
[54:17] all seven trumpets were contained in
[54:19] that seventh trumpet
[54:22] now i'm talking to the gentile bride i'm
[54:25] not talking about the jews the jews have
[54:27] sounding of trumpets the jews
[54:29] have a revelation of trumpets under a
[54:31] feast of trumpets and they have the
[54:32] sounding of the seventh trumpet
[54:35] they have that and the reality amen and
[54:37] those two witnesses will be the sounding
[54:39] of the seventh trumpet to reveal the six
[54:41] trumpets
[54:44] and what were the six trumpets the six
[54:45] trumpets were gathering in the jews
[54:49] for what for spiritual war for a
[54:51] revelation that's going to come forth
[54:53] of the true atonement in christ jesus
[54:55] amen and they're going to recognize the
[54:57] lamb that have been slain and they're
[54:58] going to mourn
[54:59] amen and they're going to gather
[55:00] together it's going to start another
[55:01] spiritual war
[55:03] only this spiritual war because as jews
[55:05] is going to take on a physical
[55:06] manifestation and a gathering of all
[55:09] nations
[55:12] but don't forget that there's been seven
[55:14] trumpets
[55:15] to the gentiles seven gospel trumpets
[55:19] a trumpet in each church age
[55:22] and brother branham sounds the seventh
[55:24] trumpet and in that seventh trumpet
[55:26] because it's a gathering of all the
[55:27] truths of the previous age
[55:29] it's the sounding of all seven trumpets
[55:31] in one trumpet
[55:36] i'd say it's a great gospel trumpet
[55:41] praise god
[55:45] what kind of battle will that start
[55:51] that's why i say i thought of this the
[55:53] invisible
[55:54] final battle
[55:58] i mean you may want to call spiritual
[56:00] armageddon
[56:01] and natural armageddon we can use
[56:03] whatever terms that make us understand
[56:04] it i don't know the best term to use i
[56:06] don't know the best way to describe it
[56:08] but i realize that there's a sounding of
[56:09] a seventh gospel trump and every trumpet
[56:11] before declared war and this one's
[56:13] sounding all seven at once and it's
[56:14] going to be a massive
[56:16] war and this is going to be the final
[56:17] battle for the gentile bride
[56:20] however you want to label that label it
[56:22] any way that makes you comfortable
[56:23] amen but i'm comfortable recognizing
[56:25] that this is a great gospel trumpet
[56:27] that's calling together
[56:28] the armies of heaven to war and that war
[56:31] is over the word amen
[56:38] where am i at i think i'm in a new quote
[56:42] the feast of trumpets he says notice now
[56:45] we find now that the natural power under
[56:47] the natural to a natural nation israel
[56:49] was loosed there
[56:50] and what did it do it went and made war
[56:51] and how it murdered and persecuted
[56:53] and brother brethren i was talking about
[56:55] under the fifth trumpet
[56:57] amen when when uh the the two hundred
[57:00] thousand thousand demons come
[57:01] out amen and and they they go when
[57:04] brother man said where did they go they
[57:05] went to the armies of hitler
[57:06] mussolini and stalin and they went
[57:10] those forces went there and they brought
[57:13] a physical persecution against the jews
[57:17] and that's what brother ben was
[57:18] referring to he said
[57:21] what did they do it went and made war
[57:22] and how it murdered and persecuted he's
[57:24] speaking of the holocaust
[57:26] now in the client in the ecclesiastical
[57:29] realm of it
[57:31] he's showing a transition
[57:34] it was in the natural realm because the
[57:36] naturals to the jews
[57:39] but now it's moved into ecclesiastical
[57:41] realm and it's going to take on a
[57:42] spiritual nature
[57:46] not not necessarily a holocaust of
[57:49] murdering and gathering physical people
[57:51] in a physical place we know there's a
[57:53] future for that
[57:55] in the tribulation period but now it's
[57:57] moved into the ecclesiastical realms
[58:02] and i hope that god opens your eyes to
[58:03] this now
[58:05] because i realize this is just not
[58:06] speaking to this church here
[58:08] this tape goes worldwide and i don't
[58:10] mean to hurt anybody's feelings
[58:11] but just to tell the truth now the
[58:13] ecclesia ecclesiastical realm has been
[58:16] opened from the natural revival of the
[58:18] old pagan rome
[58:19] went forth on those jews which has
[58:21] always been their enemy the lion with
[58:23] the teeth and everything has stomped
[58:25] down and broke out the people
[58:27] rome always been god's enemy
[58:31] and it was turned loose in the same
[58:32] spirit by dictators of the world because
[58:34] the religious system was still holding
[58:37] now it's been loosed
[58:40] mother of is telling you something's
[58:42] changed
[58:43] and when a prophet of god is on the
[58:45] earth amen a word prophet a prophet like
[58:47] moses a prophet like paul brother like
[58:50] brother branham amen there was three
[58:52] prophets like this
[58:55] one that brought the old testament one
[58:56] that brought the new testament and one
[58:58] to come back and revealed it all
[59:02] he's standing on this earth and he's
[59:03] telling you something changed it went
[59:06] out amen those demon forces went out
[59:08] they went into the armies and then they
[59:10] brought a physical persecution now
[59:11] they've moved to the classical realm
[59:13] because the religious system was holding
[59:15] but the religious system is not holding
[59:16] any anymore
[59:17] and he goes on to say he says that's
[59:18] happened just recently
[59:21] and he's speaking of the vatican council
[59:23] amen the vatican 2 council
[59:24] where the pope starts reaching out to
[59:26] what he calls his fallen brethren the
[59:28] protestant church is to bring them back
[59:30] together and unite them in an ecumenical
[59:31] move
[59:34] and brother man's looking at this pope
[59:36] make this move and he's a prophet on
[59:38] this day
[59:39] and he's saying see now there's been a
[59:42] barrier
[59:42] what was the barrier the old kings of
[59:44] the east could not
[59:46] get across the river euphrates there was
[59:47] a barrier that helped them but that
[59:49] barrier is gone now
[59:50] because the protestants now amen there's
[59:52] no more word to separate them
[59:55] they don't believe the word they believe
[59:57] dogmas and creeds and they'll take just
[59:59] anything anybody
[1:00:00] says and as long as you hold one or two
[1:00:02] principles the same
[1:00:03] we'll all be christians and we're all
[1:00:06] saved
[1:00:07] i still the same attitude that's out
[1:00:09] there as long as we hold a couple
[1:00:10] principles the same
[1:00:11] and you repeat a couple phrases the same
[1:00:13] way i repeat a couple of phrases
[1:00:15] then we're all the same you're my
[1:00:16] brother we're all christians we're all
[1:00:18] saved
[1:00:21] and the water the word that it separated
[1:00:24] that old babylonian system the kings of
[1:00:27] the east the assyrian babylonian
[1:00:29] religion
[1:00:29] that was now alive in the catholic
[1:00:31] church
[1:00:33] there was a barrier that was separating
[1:00:35] that but under the sixth trumpet the
[1:00:37] plague was poured on the river and the
[1:00:39] river dried up to make way for the kings
[1:00:40] of the east to come across
[1:00:43] and at that time after that three
[1:00:45] unclean spirits went out of the mouth
[1:00:47] of three individuals the false prophet
[1:00:49] the beast
[1:00:50] and the dragon amen and those three
[1:00:52] brother ben said
[1:00:53] was an antichrist spirit teaching false
[1:00:56] doctrine of the trinity
[1:00:57] he said not when it went out but when it
[1:00:59] began to be revealed
[1:01:01] when was that it was in brother
[1:01:03] brennan's ministry
[1:01:05] so he's telling you he's putting a time
[1:01:07] indicator amen euphrates spiritually
[1:01:10] speaking euphrates is dried up
[1:01:12] the barrier between the old kings of the
[1:01:14] east the babylonian religion
[1:01:15] it was alive in the catholic church amen
[1:01:17] has now crossed over
[1:01:19] amen into the church
[1:01:22] all the protestants and that's still
[1:01:25] happening
[1:01:27] they're still uniting they're still
[1:01:28] different ones signing accords and
[1:01:30] they're still
[1:01:30] the the water is still drying up and
[1:01:33] they're still coming across
[1:01:36] and brother bam said now that's happened
[1:01:38] recently speaking of vatican due counsel
[1:01:40] he said
[1:01:40] now now now it's moved into the
[1:01:44] ecclesiastical realm
[1:01:48] and it looks like nothing's happening
[1:01:52] no world war ii no bombs falling
[1:01:56] no concentration camps
[1:02:00] but i don't think the war is any less
[1:02:02] intense
[1:02:04] i don't think the battle is any less
[1:02:06] intense than it was there
[1:02:08] and i don't think the effort of the
[1:02:10] devil has diminished any
[1:02:12] to shut down the truth as he was trying
[1:02:14] to shut out the jews
[1:02:16] trying to exterminate the truth he's
[1:02:19] trying to exterminate the truth
[1:02:20] with just as much force as he did then
[1:02:24] only up till now he's prying he's been
[1:02:27] trying to do it
[1:02:28] through subtlety
[1:02:31] through deception
[1:02:35] but if he's got to crank it up the force
[1:02:36] he can crank it up to force
[1:02:40] praise god
[1:02:43] amen because the religious system was
[1:02:47] still holding
[1:02:48] now it's been loosed brother bram said
[1:02:50] the religious system is loosed
[1:02:51] the barrier is loosed
[1:02:55] what has it done in the cunningness as
[1:02:57] he said he come in like flatteries and
[1:02:59] what has he done
[1:03:00] he's bringing the protestant ecumenical
[1:03:02] council of the world churches the spirit
[1:03:04] of antichrist upon
[1:03:05] both of them bringing them to the
[1:03:07] slaughter just like they did the other
[1:03:09] and the hour to call the bride how
[1:03:12] loosed in the ecclesiastical church
[1:03:14] spirit
[1:03:14] loosed upon what not upon the
[1:03:16] denominations
[1:03:18] upon the bride but there you'll get it
[1:03:21] the bride will not go through that time
[1:03:23] the bride will not have a repeat of what
[1:03:25] happened to the jews
[1:03:27] the nominal church will amen the foolish
[1:03:30] virgin will
[1:03:30] amen the 144 000 will but but the bride
[1:03:33] will not go through that time like the
[1:03:35] jews did
[1:03:36] before it gets there maybe just before
[1:03:38] it gets her i don't know how much before
[1:03:40] he gets there he'll whisk her away
[1:03:42] she will not see that he'll keep her
[1:03:43] from it the church will but
[1:03:46] but not the bride so this has been
[1:03:48] loosed amen has been loosed upon who
[1:03:51] who's he gunning for he's gunning for
[1:03:53] the bride he was gunning for the jews
[1:03:55] who was it loose before before
[1:03:56] on the jews who's it loosed upon now the
[1:03:58] bride
[1:04:02] because he hates the spiritually
[1:04:03] revealed word
[1:04:06] and the one that he hates the most is a
[1:04:08] spiritually revealed word to the
[1:04:09] individual
[1:04:11] that's the thing that he hates make it a
[1:04:13] church system please make it a church
[1:04:15] system
[1:04:16] make it a group make it all of us let's
[1:04:18] just say
[1:04:19] everybody who walks in these doors this
[1:04:21] sunday we're all bride
[1:04:22] we're all okay we're all part of it we
[1:04:24] got our stamp on our card we came to
[1:04:26] church we came in this building this is
[1:04:27] the right place with the right doctrine
[1:04:28] and the right teaching
[1:04:29] we're all okay that's that is the
[1:04:32] teaching that he loves
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:34] he loves that teaching because if we all
[1:04:37] settle down in that teaching
[1:04:38] all he's got to do is bring an anointing
[1:04:40] to one or two at the top of that ladder
[1:04:42] and he can sway the whole group into
[1:04:44] deception
[1:04:46] but the truth that he hates is that this
[1:04:48] revelation is to the individual
[1:04:51] to the end i know myself i mean i don't
[1:04:53] need a group i don't need another
[1:04:55] teacher i don't need a priest i don't
[1:04:56] need anybody to tell me because god
[1:04:58] himself has told me
[1:05:00] i met him in the backside of the desert
[1:05:02] and he told me who i
[1:05:03] am and all hell is against this
[1:05:06] revelation
[1:05:07] amen he wants to make it a group he'll
[1:05:09] try to do it in the message make it a
[1:05:10] group we hold this doctrine we hold this
[1:05:12] doctrine this group this group
[1:05:14] don't be part of any group amen it's an
[1:05:16] individual connected to christ
[1:05:18] and satan is fighting that revelation
[1:05:23] well we all believe like this group
[1:05:24] we've all been like this group i don't
[1:05:26] want to believe like any group i want to
[1:05:27] believe by revelation that he gives me
[1:05:29] personally
[1:05:30] that i see it in the word that i'm not a
[1:05:32] parent repeating a preacher but i've got
[1:05:34] my own revelation
[1:05:35] of who i am and what the word is for
[1:05:37] this day and where i fit into the
[1:05:39] picture
[1:05:40] all hell is against that revelation
[1:05:47] that's why amen if you preach that
[1:05:49] revelation teach that revelation and
[1:05:51] bring that revelation
[1:05:52] you better be ready for trouble
[1:05:56] because satan hates that
[1:05:59] trouble comes in all kinds of forms to
[1:06:01] bring discouragement to bring
[1:06:02] disappointment
[1:06:03] amen to bring exhaustion
[1:06:08] but what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:06:09] to stop that truth from being expressed
[1:06:12] and catching the individuals because he
[1:06:13] has no power over individuals with an
[1:06:16] individual connection to the throne of
[1:06:17] god
[1:06:19] because god can make a move amen and all
[1:06:21] the believers in the whole world will
[1:06:23] catch it
[1:06:25] because they don't have to wait they
[1:06:27] don't have to wait for a certain group
[1:06:29] or a certain
[1:06:30] teaching to come out or a certain man to
[1:06:32] say it amen they're catching their own
[1:06:33] revelation from god they have their own
[1:06:35] connection with god
[1:06:38] all hell is against that revelation
[1:06:42] that's what brother ben says christ is
[1:06:44] mystery guard reveal he says it over and
[1:06:46] over
[1:06:46] what's the devil howling about that is
[1:06:47] being revealed that the bride is
[1:06:49] catching it
[1:06:50] that she's knowing her position not in
[1:06:52] the group it's not like we
[1:06:53] we we're all uniting with christ
[1:06:59] brother branham said in every church
[1:07:01] there's believers make believers and
[1:07:02] unbelievers
[1:07:03] pastors don't like saying that i don't
[1:07:05] like saying that but it's the truth and
[1:07:07] if i don't say it
[1:07:08] you'll settle down and say i'm in the
[1:07:10] group don't be in the group because in
[1:07:12] the group as believers
[1:07:13] unbelievers and make believers you
[1:07:15] better make your calling and election
[1:07:17] sure you better know for yourself who
[1:07:19] you are who god told you himself
[1:07:21] a personal revelation of jesus christ to
[1:07:24] you personally
[1:07:26] so that the sort of the pastor says amen
[1:07:28] there's believers make believers and
[1:07:30] unbelievers in here you say well i know
[1:07:31] which one i am
[1:07:35] i'm the believer not by merit amen not
[1:07:38] my performance
[1:07:39] amen but i'm a believer by faith amen
[1:07:41] god has unlocked it in my heart and i
[1:07:43] know it's the truth and i know i'm part
[1:07:45] of it
[1:07:48] amen you know
[1:07:52] your flesh is an unbeliever
[1:07:57] your human spirit is a make-believer
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:02] the only believer is the genuine you
[1:08:03] down on the inside
[1:08:05] that's the only believer amen these
[1:08:07] other realms have to go away or be
[1:08:09] changed
[1:08:11] amen they just have to dissolve or
[1:08:13] they've got to be changed
[1:08:14] amen but the only real believers the
[1:08:16] believer down on the inside
[1:08:17] amen so if your flesh does something
[1:08:19] that an unbeliever would do
[1:08:20] amen let the real believer on the inside
[1:08:22] jerk the chain and bring it back
[1:08:24] in line but don't let the devil tell you
[1:08:26] you're not a believer
[1:08:29] if the spirit amen would begin to doubt
[1:08:31] or have a question or a concern
[1:08:33] or a misunderstanding on the word or not
[1:08:35] sure about this or not sure about that
[1:08:37] amen let that spirit be a make-believer
[1:08:40] amen amen you let the believer on the
[1:08:42] inside raise up and say
[1:08:44] hush
[1:08:48] quit your presuming quit your sin and
[1:08:49] quit quit your thinking amen
[1:08:51] i know who i am and i know in whom i
[1:08:55] have believed and i know he's
[1:08:56] able all
[1:09:00] hell is against this revelation this is
[1:09:02] what the battle is over friends
[1:09:05] battle is over you as one person
[1:09:09] being a bride of jesus christ you as one
[1:09:12] person
[1:09:13] being the word made flesh you as one
[1:09:16] individual being the manifestation of
[1:09:19] jesus christ in this age
[1:09:20] all hell is against that revelation
[1:09:28] praise be to god
[1:09:31] now i want to start looking at i'm going
[1:09:34] to i'm going to read some quotes now
[1:09:37] and i want to start looking at things
[1:09:40] that brother venom says
[1:09:42] he's talking about revelation 19 and
[1:09:44] armageddon
[1:09:45] things that he says that make you think
[1:09:48] brother branham is he god is using that
[1:09:52] vessel
[1:09:53] to speak in a certain way we need to pay
[1:09:56] attention to what he says
[1:09:58] in the feast of trumpets he says now
[1:09:59] notice while that group is writing
[1:10:02] making themselves ready to stomp out
[1:10:04] everything that won't agree with them
[1:10:06] there is another group being made ready
[1:10:07] after a while revelation 19.
[1:10:09] the next time the church is heard she
[1:10:11] comes also
[1:10:12] not upon exactly horses
[1:10:17] in revelation 19 she comes riding on
[1:10:18] white horses but brother brandon said
[1:10:20] not exactly upon horses
[1:10:24] is brother branham denying the word no
[1:10:26] he realizes the book of revelation is a
[1:10:28] book of
[1:10:29] symbols and he's trying to get you
[1:10:33] to move away from the symbol to what the
[1:10:36] symbol represents
[1:10:39] oh praise god not exactly horses but
[1:10:42] brother in freedom the bible says
[1:10:44] horses
[1:10:47] and brother branham even uses this to
[1:10:49] defend himself
[1:10:51] he uses this scripture when the man says
[1:10:53] how can you say
[1:10:54] when you were over beyond the curtain of
[1:10:56] time in the sixth dimension that your
[1:10:57] horse was there
[1:10:58] how are horses there brother said didn't
[1:11:00] you read the bible he comes riding a
[1:11:01] white horse and they come riding white
[1:11:03] horses
[1:11:04] brother brandon uses to defend himself
[1:11:06] then he turns around and says not
[1:11:07] exactly horses
[1:11:12] it's a different kind of transportation
[1:11:14] it's a different kind of power that
[1:11:15] moves them
[1:11:18] represented as a white horse
[1:11:22] but not exactly a horse
[1:11:27] i love it i love it
[1:11:30] because this is why god wants us to
[1:11:32] catch by revelation not intellectual
[1:11:35] teaching not the coloring book not the
[1:11:36] fill in the blanks
[1:11:38] he doesn't want us to come up and teach
[1:11:40] it amen and teach it in such a way that
[1:11:42] we lay it out so nice and tidy then
[1:11:44] laughter where we pass out the exam
[1:11:46] and multiple choices a b d c a
[1:11:50] god doesn't want that god wants to be in
[1:11:52] such a way you say if you don't show me
[1:11:53] i won't get it
[1:11:55] the bible says white horses brother bram
[1:11:57] says white horses it proves that there
[1:11:58] can be horses over there and i didn't
[1:11:59] even say i was in heaven but look at the
[1:12:01] bible anyways
[1:12:05] nice is not exactly upon horses was it
[1:12:07] horses or not horses
[1:12:10] but god wants god wants to teach he
[1:12:12] wants to be the revealer of the truth
[1:12:15] he wants us to understand he'll use
[1:12:18] preaching he'll use teaching
[1:12:19] but unless god unlocks it
[1:12:22] you'll walk away and next time somebody
[1:12:25] speaks to you'll be confused
[1:12:28] it'll all make sense in the service and
[1:12:30] it won't make no sense later
[1:12:33] unless it comes by spiritual revelation
[1:12:40] not upon exactly horses but the bible
[1:12:42] said he was on a white horse
[1:12:44] and the host of heaven was following him
[1:12:46] upon white horses
[1:12:48] he just he just declared listen i'm
[1:12:50] going to read this again because it's
[1:12:51] kind of funny
[1:12:53] revelation 19 the next time the church
[1:12:55] is heard she comes also
[1:12:56] not upon exactly horses but the bible
[1:12:59] said
[1:13:00] he was on white horses and the host of
[1:13:01] heaven was following him on white horses
[1:13:04] brother said not exactly horses but the
[1:13:05] bible said white horses
[1:13:08] well brother branham since you didn't
[1:13:09] say what the bible said i'm going to
[1:13:10] take what the bible said
[1:13:14] take what the bible says but understand
[1:13:15] what the bible means quote the bible
[1:13:18] verbatim but understand that's a symbol
[1:13:21] because revelation is a book of symbols
[1:13:26] is that right well this group down here
[1:13:28] has got 2 000 bound at the river
[1:13:30] euphrates and has been bound for two
[1:13:31] thousand years
[1:13:32] also that church has bound the holy
[1:13:34] ghost for nearly two thousand years
[1:13:36] under martyrdom back there and under the
[1:13:37] church ages it's been bound not at the
[1:13:39] river of euphrates but at the door of
[1:13:41] creeds and dongmas that the holy spirit
[1:13:43] can't work in the church because of
[1:13:45] man-made systems
[1:13:47] but she is going to be liberated she is
[1:13:49] coming back
[1:13:50] that's what the bible said and these two
[1:13:53] meet one another on the battleground
[1:13:55] lucifer and michael again
[1:13:57] like in the beginning they've been bound
[1:13:59] for two thousand years almost
[1:14:00] almost two thousand years just
[1:14:03] catch what he says he says
[1:14:07] now this one's been bound at the river
[1:14:10] euphrates for two thousand years but
[1:14:11] over here the holy ghost has been bound
[1:14:13] by
[1:14:14] man-made systems and creeds and dogmas
[1:14:17] but both are going to be loosed
[1:14:23] the the demon forces that have been
[1:14:26] bound at the river euphrates for two
[1:14:27] thousand years because of the religious
[1:14:29] system
[1:14:29] it'll be loosed because the religious
[1:14:31] system will be so off the word the
[1:14:33] euphrates will be dry
[1:14:35] and those spirits will move right into
[1:14:37] the protestant churches
[1:14:39] and they'll never know it
[1:14:44] so that's been loosed on that end amen
[1:14:48] now on this end the holy ghost has been
[1:14:51] bound
[1:14:51] for nearly two thousand years by manmade
[1:14:53] systems trees and dogmas
[1:14:55] but it'll be loosed in the evening time
[1:14:58] by the evening time message the holy
[1:15:01] ghost
[1:15:01] back in the church again
[1:15:04] and what does that do it starts the war
[1:15:08] again
[1:15:08] lucifer and michael facing off again
[1:15:11] they've been
[1:15:11] bound but now they're loosed and what
[1:15:13] are they coming to
[1:15:14] a great final battle for the gentile
[1:15:17] bride
[1:15:18] for the revealed word that's through the
[1:15:20] gentile bride amen it's come back again
[1:15:23] it's been bound it's been limited
[1:15:25] there's been skirmishes but there's been
[1:15:26] a great binding
[1:15:27] but that great binding has been released
[1:15:29] on the ecumenical side
[1:15:30] amen has released the ecclesiastical
[1:15:32] side amen and by the opening of the word
[1:15:35] amen by the true revelation that dispels
[1:15:38] all man-made systems
[1:15:39] all dogmas all man's ideas it's loose
[1:15:42] the holiest ghost has been bound by
[1:15:44] man's dogmas man's creeds man's chains
[1:15:48] it's been loose to who it's been loosed
[1:15:50] back upon the bride
[1:15:53] and these two forces
[1:15:56] remember that's what brother ben said
[1:15:57] these two meet one another on the
[1:15:59] battlegrounds
[1:16:00] lucifer and michael like in the
[1:16:02] beginning
[1:16:04] it's a repeat of that battle
[1:16:08] praise be to god i hope you understand i
[1:16:12] hope god can bring it in revelation for
[1:16:14] him
[1:16:15] see what i'm saying friends this isn't
[1:16:17] like another church age this isn't like
[1:16:20] anything that's happened before
[1:16:22] and then there's been a truth rise up
[1:16:23] and a war over that truth and that
[1:16:25] and they fought the battle and and the
[1:16:27] devil did all of his tactics to shut it
[1:16:29] down
[1:16:29] and begin to destroy the vessels and
[1:16:31] then the messenger would leave and the
[1:16:33] truth would get obscure
[1:16:34] the church would go into spiritual death
[1:16:36] but god would raise up another one
[1:16:38] because he always had a lex seed that
[1:16:39] was coming through there
[1:16:41] and the lex seed was limited by all
[1:16:43] these creeds and all this dogma
[1:16:45] it was a limitation to the elect seed
[1:16:48] because of the misunderstanding of the
[1:16:50] word because of the false teaching
[1:16:53] right so the election was always limited
[1:16:56] but then a truth would come up and
[1:16:57] they'd rise up in that truth that truth
[1:16:58] would push back the forces of the devil
[1:17:00] and a big fight would break out
[1:17:03] then the plague would fall then
[1:17:04] spiritual death said and god did it
[1:17:06] again
[1:17:08] but this time is different
[1:17:11] because this time it's not another truth
[1:17:13] coming forth for another cycle
[1:17:14] he has broke the cycle by bringing all
[1:17:17] the truth and totally exposing the devil
[1:17:20] he's completely broke the cycle this
[1:17:22] last trumpet will not start another
[1:17:24] repeat cycle
[1:17:25] this last trumpet will break the cycle
[1:17:27] for the elect because she will have the
[1:17:29] word
[1:17:30] vindicated proven by god himself to be
[1:17:32] the truth and she will stand
[1:17:34] on that word in the word only
[1:17:37] and it will loose the holy ghost they
[1:17:38] meant to be in full measure back in the
[1:17:40] church again
[1:17:41] to fight back this forces that have been
[1:17:43] loosed
[1:17:45] and the band will cross over euphrates
[1:17:48] see the brother branham's not using cute
[1:17:50] analogies he's telling us spiritually
[1:17:52] what is happening
[1:17:53] you're afraid he says dried up well i
[1:17:55] can go look at your phrase i can pull up
[1:17:56] a google map image and i can see
[1:17:59] there's water there
[1:18:03] there's even christians who are watching
[1:18:04] euphrates
[1:18:06] because there's been droughts recently
[1:18:08] and it looked like it was going to dry
[1:18:09] up and then they had a dam there was a
[1:18:10] problem with a dam
[1:18:11] and it looks like
[1:18:15] there may be a fulfillment of that
[1:18:16] physically but by the time that comes
[1:18:18] it's too late for you
[1:18:23] it's too late for you because there's
[1:18:24] been a prophet in this day that's always
[1:18:25] said euphrates is already dried up
[1:18:28] i don't have to look at a google image i
[1:18:30] realize what he's talking about
[1:18:31] spiritually
[1:18:32] whether it be a physical manifestation
[1:18:34] probably there will be
[1:18:37] but that's too late for the gentiles
[1:18:42] it's too late then that's going to be at
[1:18:45] a time of redemption for the 144 000.
[1:18:48] not for the gentile bride don't be
[1:18:50] watching euphrates friends
[1:18:52] brother braham said euphrates is dry and
[1:18:54] the armies are marching across the kings
[1:18:55] are coming across
[1:18:57] don't watch euphrates it won't mean
[1:18:58] anything to you
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:01] god's already told us
[1:19:05] praise god praise god
[1:19:13] i just pray god just keep revealing the
[1:19:15] truth to us
[1:19:16] to me and then so we can see
[1:19:20] i'm going to read i got a couple long
[1:19:21] quotes to read so hang tight with me
[1:19:24] at the fourth seal brother bram says now
[1:19:26] the battle started in heaven
[1:19:27] it'll be finished on earth in the form
[1:19:29] of armageddon now let's watch and see it
[1:19:31] unfold
[1:19:32] and maybe we can unfold it if the lord
[1:19:34] help us right now to do this now watch
[1:19:37] it unfold
[1:19:39] what's brother graham saying the battle
[1:19:40] started in heaven it'll end in
[1:19:42] armageddon
[1:19:43] let's unfold it
[1:19:47] this is interesting he's going to show
[1:19:49] us coming to the battle of armageddon
[1:19:50] and he wants to unfold it
[1:19:53] so let the prophet unfold it what he's
[1:19:56] not going to talk about is tanks
[1:19:58] and guns and warfare
[1:20:01] when he's unfolding this coming to the
[1:20:03] battle of armageddon he is not going to
[1:20:05] talk about anything physical he's going
[1:20:07] to talk about the ecclesiastical realm
[1:20:09] he is unfolding this coming to the
[1:20:11] battle of armageddon
[1:20:14] he says the mysterious writer watch what
[1:20:16] he does he's unfolding
[1:20:18] it now opposed refused to repent and go
[1:20:21] back to the original
[1:20:22] blood word the word became blood and
[1:20:25] flesh
[1:20:26] he refused to go back to it his
[1:20:28] antichrist the true word bride
[1:20:31] he opposes the true word bride takes his
[1:20:34] own bride
[1:20:35] he opposes this true bride also
[1:20:38] and he takes his own bride and brings
[1:20:40] her to him
[1:20:42] in a form of a religion called creeds
[1:20:44] and dogma see what's he doing
[1:20:46] he's unfolding the coming down to
[1:20:48] armageddon
[1:20:50] and now seeing the holy bride he is
[1:20:53] against her
[1:20:55] but he forms his own bride called
[1:20:57] antichrist by antichrist teaching
[1:20:59] which is contrary to christ see how
[1:21:01] shrewd he is
[1:21:02] and now instead of having a unity of
[1:21:04] love controlling worship
[1:21:06] under blood he's got a denomination
[1:21:08] instead of having the word he took
[1:21:10] creeds
[1:21:10] dogmas and so forth skipping down two
[1:21:13] paragraphs
[1:21:14] it says notice it's christ the christ
[1:21:17] the antichrist refuses the true bride
[1:21:20] doctrine
[1:21:21] what's he doing he's unfolding the
[1:21:23] coming to armageddon
[1:21:24] he said let's unfold it now he's still
[1:21:27] in the same
[1:21:28] thoughts the antichrist refuses the true
[1:21:31] bride doctrine
[1:21:32] and therefore he takes his own bride now
[1:21:34] and builds her up under a creed of his
[1:21:36] own
[1:21:37] takes his own bride and makes her a
[1:21:38] denomination
[1:21:40] she gives birth to other denominations
[1:21:41] as quoted in the holy scripture
[1:21:43] gives birth to daughters and she becomes
[1:21:46] just like her mother
[1:21:47] natural worldly denominational opposing
[1:21:49] the spiritual bride
[1:21:51] the word now the he opposes the
[1:21:54] spiritual bride
[1:21:56] the word what is the spiritual bride
[1:22:00] the word
[1:22:03] i hope that doesn't stumble you what is
[1:22:06] the spiritual pride
[1:22:08] the word what was john the baptist when
[1:22:10] he came the word
[1:22:12] what was paul when he came the word
[1:22:13] enlightened to the gentiles what was
[1:22:15] jesus when he came the word
[1:22:17] what was brother branham when he came
[1:22:19] the word what are you and your coming
[1:22:21] the word
[1:22:23] because there's a promise of a bride
[1:22:24] that'll be here in the end time and
[1:22:26] you're
[1:22:26] if you're part of that bride and you're
[1:22:28] part of the word and then you're a
[1:22:29] manifestation of the revelation
[1:22:31] of the word the prophecy of a bride in
[1:22:33] this day
[1:22:35] and that makes the spiritual bride the
[1:22:37] word
[1:22:39] on in the fourth seal he says now to
[1:22:41] gather them on their mixed colored
[1:22:43] horses
[1:22:45] he's gathering this thing together mixed
[1:22:47] with creed's denominations man made
[1:22:49] doctrines
[1:22:49] is that right sure a mixed color the
[1:22:52] mixed color of the dead
[1:22:53] pale horse of the world now that's right
[1:22:56] mixed colors of the dead
[1:22:58] worldly form of the pale horse oh my
[1:23:01] no blood of the word at all
[1:23:04] because it was the word that bled for
[1:23:06] you without the word you're not getting
[1:23:08] the blood
[1:23:09] they're just still preaching thinking
[1:23:11] they're getting people the blood but
[1:23:12] they refused a path to the blood which
[1:23:14] is the word
[1:23:15] because it was the word that bled for
[1:23:17] you the word died for you they don't
[1:23:18] have
[1:23:19] any no holy blood of the word
[1:23:22] because they've rejected the word you
[1:23:24] can't have the blood
[1:23:26] it's so simple but i don't know why it's
[1:23:29] so troublesome for people's minds
[1:23:32] but it's the truth that the prophet
[1:23:33] brought us is the truth from the
[1:23:34] scriptures
[1:23:36] you reject the word you reject christ
[1:23:39] you reject christ you reject your
[1:23:41] atonement the atonement is the
[1:23:42] manifested word
[1:23:47] praise god and watch
[1:23:50] from the four corners of the earth they
[1:23:52] gather them gathers them to armageddon
[1:23:54] the bible says i'm trying to think of
[1:23:56] the scriptures i got them wrote down
[1:23:57] here i ain't calling them but
[1:23:59] where they were written down see what
[1:24:01] they are gathers them together to the
[1:24:02] great day of the battle of the lord god
[1:24:04] watch now on his mixed color worldly
[1:24:07] pale sick horse
[1:24:09] just think of it you know that's a bad
[1:24:10] thing now watch where he gathers them
[1:24:13] from the four corners of the earth they
[1:24:15] are gathered now for the showdown
[1:24:17] the showdown will be at armageddon
[1:24:18] according to the word on the pale horse
[1:24:21] riding on it with a death tact with the
[1:24:23] name
[1:24:24] with the name tacked on him death
[1:24:26] because we go back to the seals
[1:24:28] and we see that the white horse rider
[1:24:30] had no wasn't named
[1:24:33] and he went out it was an antichrist
[1:24:34] spirit that went out to combat the truth
[1:24:36] amen and he come out looking pure but he
[1:24:38] wasn't pure and he came out to defile to
[1:24:40] deceive and to conquer
[1:24:41] and he switched horses but it was the
[1:24:43] same rider antichrist spirit
[1:24:46] and he moved to the red horse to the
[1:24:47] black horse then he moved to the pale
[1:24:48] horse but when he moved to the pale
[1:24:50] horse
[1:24:50] in the seals in revelation chapter 6 now
[1:24:52] he gets a name
[1:24:53] and his name is death and hell follows
[1:24:55] him
[1:24:56] so when he moves to the pale horse he
[1:24:58] gets a name death
[1:25:00] and hell follows him so brother
[1:25:03] branham's saying now
[1:25:04] he's named it's the pale horse we're in
[1:25:06] the time of the pale horse
[1:25:09] and the pair is riding on it with a
[1:25:12] death tact with the name
[1:25:13] tacked on him death the antichrist
[1:25:15] listen antichrist first denomination
[1:25:18] that can't be spirit he says it can't be
[1:25:20] the holy spirit that's what he's saying
[1:25:22] with his jezebel a prostitute to the
[1:25:24] word with her daughters
[1:25:25] protestants gathering themselves
[1:25:27] together now in unity
[1:25:30] now here they are joining themselves
[1:25:31] together coming to that showdown to
[1:25:33] armageddon
[1:25:34] and riding on a mixed-colored horse with
[1:25:36] one horse of white one horse of red
[1:25:38] one horse of black the three different
[1:25:41] political powers spiritual power
[1:25:42] controlled by demon power which is the
[1:25:44] antichrist
[1:25:45] mixing that all together you've got a
[1:25:47] pale sickly looking thing he's riding on
[1:25:50] that's right now notice look what he's
[1:25:52] riding on this pale looking grizzled
[1:25:53] colored horse mixed with black
[1:25:55] red and white coming into the battle
[1:25:58] gathering his subjects from every nation
[1:26:00] under heaven
[1:26:01] did not daniel interpret the dream and
[1:26:03] seen that streak of iron running to
[1:26:05] every kingdom of rome
[1:26:06] here they come gathering now set still
[1:26:08] for the close just a minute and listen
[1:26:10] close
[1:26:11] he's still unfolding the coming to
[1:26:13] armageddon
[1:26:15] they're gathering and now to do it bring
[1:26:16] his subjects from the four corners of
[1:26:18] the earth
[1:26:18] riding a pale sickly three colored mixed
[1:26:22] same man in revelation 19 not only is he
[1:26:25] getting ready but christ is getting
[1:26:26] ready to meet him
[1:26:28] the battle is going to be hot and heavy
[1:26:33] christ in revelation 19 christ is
[1:26:35] gathering his not from the four corners
[1:26:37] of the earth because there's going to be
[1:26:38] a little bitty remnant
[1:26:39] what's he going he's gathering them from
[1:26:41] the four corners of heaven
[1:26:43] we'll get them souls under the altar
[1:26:44] tomorrow night and you'll see whether
[1:26:46] it's right or not
[1:26:47] four corners of heaven on a snow white
[1:26:50] horse
[1:26:51] is it exactly a horse
[1:26:55] brother and say that i said that because
[1:26:57] when the saints were riding on white
[1:26:58] horses and not exactly a horse now he's
[1:26:59] coming on a pure white horse
[1:27:01] and i'm just asking the question exactly
[1:27:03] a horse
[1:27:04] or not exactly a horse let's just keep
[1:27:07] reading
[1:27:12] amen a snow white horse he also has a
[1:27:14] name
[1:27:15] not death but the word of god life
[1:27:19] amen god wrote right on his thigh here
[1:27:21] the word of god that's
[1:27:22] the only life because god is the only
[1:27:24] source of eternal life there is
[1:27:26] zoe is that right and he's god wrote
[1:27:28] life riding on a white horse and
[1:27:30] here's a man with three different powers
[1:27:32] mixed up called death
[1:27:34] gathering his earthbound delegates and
[1:27:36] christ is gathering as
[1:27:37] heaven-born subjects
[1:27:41] saints where have you been born from
[1:27:46] are you a heaven-born subject are you a
[1:27:49] saint
[1:27:50] then that's who he's gathering the white
[1:27:53] horse rider christ in revelation 19
[1:27:55] is gathering his heaven-born subjects
[1:27:59] i say i'm gathering lord i'm coming i
[1:28:02] hear the trumpet and i'm running to my
[1:28:04] captain on the white horse
[1:28:08] he's got death throat on him christ got
[1:28:10] life rolled on him
[1:28:12] those with him are on white horses also
[1:28:14] are they exactly white horses
[1:28:19] they are on white horses also and they
[1:28:20] are called the chosen before the
[1:28:22] foundation of the world amen
[1:28:23] they are faithful to the word amen i
[1:28:25] like that
[1:28:26] i like that one called chosen before the
[1:28:29] foundation of the world and then
[1:28:30] faithful to the word by their choosing

[1:28:49] what was it heaven open revelation 19
[1:28:53] christ on a white horse and the armies
[1:28:54] of heaven following after him
[1:28:56] to do what to come down to face off with
[1:28:58] lucifer again
[1:29:00] where's the battle it's in your mind
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:06] praise god i'm not denying that there'll
[1:29:09] be a manifestation
[1:29:11] in the future to israel in the flesh i'm
[1:29:13] not saying that but i'm telling you the
[1:29:15] thunders has issued this thing forth for
[1:29:17] us
[1:29:17] we've seen the heavens open amen we've
[1:29:19] seen christ coming
[1:29:20] what's he coming for he's gathering his
[1:29:22] armies under the sound of a trumpet for
[1:29:24] what
[1:29:24] for spiritual war for a showdown for a
[1:29:27] final battle
[1:29:28] and it's going to be over the word and
[1:29:30] it's going to be over what word
[1:29:32] it's going to be over the spiritual
[1:29:33] revelation to the individual
[1:29:37] that's the battleground your revelation
[1:29:39] who you
[1:29:40] are who he told you you were your place
[1:29:43] in the body
[1:29:43] your place in time your position in
[1:29:45] christ that's what the battle's over
[1:29:48] and you wonder why so much trouble comes
[1:29:50] and so much doubt
[1:29:52] and conflict and everything that you
[1:29:53] want to go right goes wrong
[1:29:55] and everything you try to do fails
[1:29:56] what's it all about he's trying to
[1:29:58] attack
[1:29:59] your revelation of who you are
[1:30:04] trying to discredit the word what's the
[1:30:06] word you're the word
[1:30:09] not this guy oh i wish we could get away
[1:30:12] from that because when i make statements
[1:30:13] like that it locks people up
[1:30:15] they start looking at flesh and the man
[1:30:16] in the mirror it has nothing to do with
[1:30:18] that guy
[1:30:19] he was the real you the one that was
[1:30:20] intended to be you from the beginning
[1:30:22] that gene of god down on the soul that's
[1:30:24] who the word is it's the manifestation
[1:30:26] of the word
[1:30:27] and it can only be reflected out of this
[1:30:29] flesh but this flesh is not it
[1:30:34] when we start to identify with this amen
[1:30:37] we start to lock ourselves away from the
[1:30:39] very promise in this hour
[1:30:40] and who we actually are we can no longer
[1:30:43] identify with this but we got to
[1:30:45] identify with the real
[1:30:46] genuine who we are on the inside that's
[1:30:49] why brother branham in his last message
[1:30:50] in communion would say you've
[1:30:52] never really seen me
[1:30:58] you've only seen the vessel that i dwell
[1:31:00] in but you've never seen me
[1:31:06] jesus in a simple scripture
[1:31:10] they ask him his disciples they're
[1:31:12] condemning him
[1:31:13] why do your disciples eat with unwashed
[1:31:15] hands
[1:31:17] and jesus says it's not that a man goes
[1:31:19] in the mouth of a man defiles a man
[1:31:22] for what you eat goes into the belly and
[1:31:24] comes out the drought
[1:31:26] now he's talking physical all physical
[1:31:29] what you eat goes into your belly it
[1:31:30] goes through the digestive system it
[1:31:32] comes out to drop
[1:31:33] brother bran or jesus is using pretty
[1:31:34] plain language
[1:31:38] and he's not denying the fact that what
[1:31:41] you eat
[1:31:42] won't harm your flesh you can take in
[1:31:46] disease
[1:31:47] you can eat spoiled food you can get
[1:31:49] food poisoning
[1:31:51] but he's saying that's not what harms a
[1:31:53] man
[1:31:55] but what defiles a man is what comes out
[1:31:57] of his heart
[1:32:00] so what is a man a man is what he is in
[1:32:03] his soul
[1:32:03] in his heart that's the man that he's
[1:32:05] talking about and you can't defile that
[1:32:07] man by what you eat
[1:32:13] you're a soul man a spirit man and a
[1:32:15] flesh man
[1:32:17] and jesus was referring to the soul man
[1:32:19] amen
[1:32:21] not the flesh man he said you're so
[1:32:22] worried about washing hands
[1:32:24] amen you're so worried about the filing
[1:32:25] of flesh the flesh is defiled anyways
[1:32:28] the fest is going to the grave anyways
[1:32:29] he's going to have to make it over but
[1:32:31] don't worry about that that's not what
[1:32:33] defiles a man what defiles a man is what
[1:32:35] comes
[1:32:35] out of his mouth for what comes out of
[1:32:37] his mouth is what comes from his heart
[1:32:39] and that's the thing that defiles a man
[1:32:42] because what jesus considered a man
[1:32:44] was what you really are in your soul
[1:32:46] that's right
[1:32:48] we've got to quit identifying with this
[1:32:50] he's going to change this
[1:32:53] quit identifying with the human mind
[1:32:56] reasoning
[1:32:57] that's going to vanish the way you're
[1:32:58] going to get the correct one one day
[1:33:01] we've got to identify with that seed
[1:33:03] gene of god
[1:33:04] who we really are in the kingdom of god
[1:33:06] who we really are in christ
[1:33:08] and that's who these promises for that's
[1:33:11] who the word is
[1:33:12] that's who the bride is
[1:33:15] oh it's tabernacled in flesh it's
[1:33:18] tabernacled in clay
[1:33:20] and then in the clays of failure to
[1:33:21] begin with the clay is full of faults
[1:33:23] and we'll we'll be full of faults until
[1:33:25] he changes it but that's not what we
[1:33:27] focus on friends we focus on the real
[1:33:29] you on the inside
[1:33:30] the word didn't come to unlock your
[1:33:32] flesh the word came to unlock your
[1:33:34] that c gene on the inside amen so that
[1:33:36] you could be a new creation in christ
[1:33:38] jesus
[1:33:39] so that you could be a meltdown in the
[1:33:40] soul so that the life that's laying
[1:33:42] there can
[1:33:43] to grow and take over
[1:33:46] and that's the real you and that's the
[1:33:48] life that'll take control of this life
[1:33:52] praise be to god where
[1:33:55] am i amen
[1:33:58] he's gathering together as heaven-born
[1:34:02] subjects
[1:34:05] now it says i'm just going to read this
[1:34:06] last paragraph i just read those with
[1:34:08] him are
[1:34:08] on white horses also they are called the
[1:34:11] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:34:12] world and they are faithful to the word
[1:34:15] oh i like that one called chosen before
[1:34:17] the foundation of the world
[1:34:18] and then faithful to the word by their
[1:34:20] choosing all stimulated with new wine
[1:34:23] and oil just riding right along
[1:34:24] coming down to meet him they know the
[1:34:26] thunders will issue this
[1:34:28] this thing course pretty soon watch how
[1:34:31] does he do
[1:34:32] so if he is the word and his name is the
[1:34:34] word then the word is life
[1:34:37] the antichrist anything anti is against
[1:34:39] so anti
[1:34:40] against the christ the word so it's got
[1:34:43] to be a creator or denomination which is
[1:34:44] against the word
[1:34:46] why i don't see how you're going to miss
[1:34:48] it do you understand
[1:34:50] how could you miss it i don't know how
[1:34:53] you're going to do it but that's true
[1:34:54] anti is against is that right take away
[1:34:57] from
[1:34:57] that's what he he was he's riding his
[1:34:59] mixed up horse
[1:35:01] we see it right here in the word of god
[1:35:02] we see it right
[1:35:04] here in the seven church ages here he
[1:35:05] brings it right back in the seals
[1:35:07] opening up
[1:35:08] and showing them things that went on in
[1:35:10] the church ages
[1:35:11] anti is against the word see why creeds
[1:35:14] why we're so against the creeds and
[1:35:15] denominations because they're against
[1:35:17] the word
[1:35:18] here we see life and death coming to the
[1:35:20] final struggle
[1:35:22] what's he doing he's still unfolding to
[1:35:24] coming down to armageddon
[1:35:26] we're still in the fourth seal we're
[1:35:27] still in the same portion he's talking
[1:35:29] about
[1:35:30] here we see life and death coming to the
[1:35:32] final struggle
[1:35:33] what's life and death coming to the
[1:35:34] final struggle the word and antichrist
[1:35:37] anything against the word it's coming
[1:35:38] down to the final
[1:35:41] because these forces had been loosed
[1:35:46] the white horse of true life
[1:35:49] the pale horse of mixed creed you see
[1:35:51] the thing coming
[1:35:52] to a real showdown
[1:35:56] you see when we look at the four horses
[1:36:00] road by the antichrist white
[1:36:04] red black pale we know that those are
[1:36:08] forces we don't
[1:36:09] we don't believe that he's really riding
[1:36:10] around on earth on a white horse
[1:36:14] so do we really believe that in the
[1:36:16] battle of armageddon jesus christ has to
[1:36:18] be on earth sitting on a white horse
[1:36:22] because the pale horse rider those are
[1:36:24] the two that are facing off
[1:36:25] and the payloads where you're not going
[1:36:26] to see a pale horse
[1:36:30] it's a force it's a power that's
[1:36:32] carrying the antichrist spirit
[1:36:38] just hang with me don't take a detour
[1:36:40] don't exit
[1:36:42] stay tight we're going to keep reading
[1:36:44] and see what brother branham says
[1:36:47] now i want to say something here you
[1:36:48] might not believe this
[1:36:50] but i looked it up sure there's only one
[1:36:52] original color
[1:36:53] that's white how many knows that there's
[1:36:56] only
[1:36:56] one original color anything else is
[1:36:58] mixed christ is on a
[1:37:00] solid white unadulterated word from the
[1:37:04] beginning
[1:37:07] what is the power that's carrying christ
[1:37:09] the anointing it's the word
[1:37:11] it's the original word from the
[1:37:13] beginning the unadulterated unmixed with
[1:37:15] any other color
[1:37:16] pure word back to the pure revelation
[1:37:19] back to the pure doctrine
[1:37:20] back to the pure intent of the word amen
[1:37:22] and what is christ writing
[1:37:24] christ is writing this pure
[1:37:25] unadulterated word
[1:37:28] it's carrying the anointing every color
[1:37:32] would be
[1:37:32] white if some chemistry hadn't broken
[1:37:35] glory
[1:37:36] every church would be standing on the
[1:37:37] apostolic doctrine of the word of god
[1:37:39] and
[1:37:39] god confirming it if he didn't have
[1:37:41] creeds and denominations mixed into it
[1:37:44] there you are oh brother evans i feel
[1:37:46] good right now yes sir yes sir
[1:37:48] only one original color that's white it
[1:37:50] never mixed with denominations or creeds
[1:37:52] no sir
[1:37:53] and remember his saints are clothed in
[1:37:55] white robes
[1:37:57] not mixed with denomination and creeds
[1:37:59] now we find out the denominations and
[1:38:01] creeds here where you get your mixed
[1:38:03] color but this original color he's
[1:38:05] writing
[1:38:06] the original color on his people and
[1:38:08] they've been dipped in the blood that
[1:38:10] cleansed that garment and sent it right
[1:38:11] back beyond her
[1:38:12] that's right so your garment your white
[1:38:16] garment is your white garment and you've
[1:38:18] been dipped in the blood of jesus christ
[1:38:20] and purified it's the righteousness of
[1:38:21] the saints
[1:38:25] i'm gonna i'm gonna inject another quote
[1:38:27] here then we're gonna come right back to
[1:38:28] the unfolding coming down to armageddon
[1:38:30] you see how he's unfolding he's not
[1:38:32] talking about military power and might
[1:38:34] and tanks and
[1:38:35] he's talking about two forces spiritual
[1:38:39] forces that are facing off in an
[1:38:40] ecclesiastical realm
[1:38:44] the uniting time and signs i just want
[1:38:46] to inject this here
[1:38:48] god is uniting his bride she is coming
[1:38:50] together from the east and the west and
[1:38:52] the north and the south
[1:38:54] why because heaven's open a trumpet has
[1:38:58] sounded
[1:38:59] and she's gathering
[1:39:03] there is a uniting time and that's on
[1:39:04] right now what is she uniting for
[1:39:06] the rapture amen god's getting her ready
[1:39:09] yes sir united
[1:39:10] what is she uniting with with the word
[1:39:14] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[1:39:15] but my word shall never pass away
[1:39:18] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[1:39:20] the lord regardless of what
[1:39:22] any denomination or anybody else says
[1:39:24] she's uniting herself she's getting
[1:39:25] ready why
[1:39:26] she is the bride i want to ask you
[1:39:29] something
[1:39:32] if she's uniting with thus saith the
[1:39:35] lord
[1:39:36] she's uniting with the word the pure
[1:39:38] word the unadulterated
[1:39:40] word what horse is she riding
[1:39:44] not exactly horses but a power that's
[1:39:48] carrying her
[1:39:52] why she's the bride that's right and
[1:39:53] she's uniting herself with her
[1:39:54] bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the
[1:39:56] word
[1:39:57] in the beginning it was the word and the
[1:39:58] word was with god and the word was god
[1:40:00] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:40:01] among us
[1:40:02] and the church and the bride and the
[1:40:04] word is becoming so
[1:40:06] one until the very word itself is
[1:40:08] working out the work of the bridegroom
[1:40:10] amen you see it a uniting not no more
[1:40:13] join the church not no more this but
[1:40:15] flee from everything and and be tied to
[1:40:18] jesus christ
[1:40:19] it's the uniting time god uniting his
[1:40:21] bride together bringing it back
[1:40:23] just exactly uniting the word of his
[1:40:26] promise
[1:40:27] now i just want you to catch that phrase
[1:40:29] uniting his bride bringing it back
[1:40:33] what's he bringing it back to he's
[1:40:36] bringing it back to his
[1:40:37] original intention before creeds and
[1:40:40] dogmas polluted it
[1:40:42] the bride the bride tree was eight down
[1:40:44] the bride tree fell through four stages
[1:40:46] of the inside but he's bringing her back
[1:40:49] bring her back bring her back to her
[1:40:51] original condition to fulfill her
[1:40:52] original purpose

[1:40:58] in the unfolding coming down to
[1:40:59] armageddon
[1:41:01] here comes satan with all four corners
[1:41:03] of the earth with his protestants

[1:41:19] where has he resurrected his saints from
[1:41:20] he's resurrected him out of dead
[1:41:22] denominationalism

[1:41:37] the church

[1:41:42] into that constellation of angels he met
[1:41:43] the lord in the air amen he represented
[1:41:46] the whole church
[1:41:48] but now this bride in the capstone

[1:42:20] branham when he was caught up we were
[1:42:22] represented in john and the bible he's

[1:42:24] where the whole bride is represented in
[1:42:26] this capstone bride
[1:42:28] who has been resurrected amen what's he

[1:44:09] word was hanging on the cross

[1:44:47] amen if i was there they're here
[1:44:51] because they're the word as much as i'm
[1:44:53] the word and wherever the word was
[1:44:55] i was there amen i was there that day on
[1:44:58] calvary i was there when noah entered
[1:45:00] the ark
[1:45:00] i was there when abraham walked away
[1:45:02] from his land i was there when david
[1:45:04] slew goliath what did brother benham
[1:45:06] teach us that
[1:45:07] it's not a cute story it's a it's a
[1:45:09] spiritual reality
[1:45:11] because there's a link i'm the word
[1:45:13] that's the word wherever there's a
[1:45:14] manifestation of the word i was caught
[1:45:16] up in that manifestation
[1:45:18] and now the manifestation of the word is
[1:45:20] that heavens have opened
[1:45:21] christ has come the word is here
[1:45:26] and if the word is here amen the host of
[1:45:28] heaven is here
[1:45:30] they're represented in the capstone
[1:45:32] bride
[1:45:34] and all of heaven is here to back you up
[1:45:37] if you're an ambassador
[1:45:39] and heaven is consistent of the word
[1:45:43] so if all of heaven is here to back you
[1:45:45] up because all of the word is here
[1:45:48] who's fighting
[1:45:52] all of hell is against this revelation
[1:45:54] the floodgates of hell is open
[1:45:56] death is riding the pale horse and hell
[1:45:58] follows him hell is spilled out upon the
[1:46:00] earth brother branham saw
[1:46:01] in jcpenney not a vision
[1:46:05] it wasn't a vision it was a reality and
[1:46:07] when he saw it it took him
[1:46:09] back to an experience he had when he was
[1:46:11] almost dead laying all his blood leading
[1:46:13] out as a boy he had went to heaven
[1:46:15] to hell and when he saw in hell he was
[1:46:17] now seeing in jcpenney in tucson arizona
[1:46:20] and he declared that hell is upon the
[1:46:23] earth
[1:46:24] and if hell is upon the earth when when
[1:46:26] the enemy comes in like a flood god
[1:46:28] raises up a standard
[1:46:30] and all of hell is here all of heaven is
[1:46:32] here
[1:46:33] because all of the word is here and
[1:46:34] heaven is consistent of the word
[1:46:36] and these two forces are facing one
[1:46:38] another again and where are they facing
[1:46:40] each other
[1:46:41] in you because you're
[1:46:44] carrying the word and standing on the
[1:46:46] word and the whole battle is about your
[1:46:48] position in christ
[1:46:49] and your revelation of who you are
[1:46:54] don't wait for a future this in the
[1:46:56] future that if you make if you're
[1:46:57] waiting for the future we're
[1:46:59] not even understanding the battle that
[1:47:00] we're in
[1:47:05] if you're an ambassador from heaven all
[1:47:07] heaven's behind you
[1:47:09] and heaven is consisted of the word
[1:47:11] notice now he's come with resurrected
[1:47:13] saints vindicating that his word is true
[1:47:16] so satan knows then the bottomless pit
[1:47:19] is ready for him
[1:47:22] don't think he's not fighting you
[1:47:27] as every elect seed catches this
[1:47:29] revelation
[1:47:31] his kingdom is being destroyed
[1:47:34] and when the final one comes in brother
[1:47:37] berm said the rapture will go
[1:47:41] when that takes place he is finished
[1:47:44] why is he fighting you why is he
[1:47:46] fighting the revelation why is he
[1:47:47] fighting with mind battles why is he
[1:47:49] fighting with troubles in every side
[1:47:51] this isn't you say well this is normal
[1:47:52] normal stuff people go through you're
[1:47:53] not a normal person
[1:47:59] other people may go through similar
[1:48:00] things but this battle is over your
[1:48:02] revelation
[1:48:03] of who you are
[1:48:08] i want to read this quote we're still in
[1:48:09] the fourth seal we're still on the uh
[1:48:11] unfolding of the coming down to
[1:48:13] armageddon don't lose where we're at
[1:48:15] if you're an ambassador from heaven all
[1:48:16] heavens behind you in heaven is
[1:48:18] consistent of the word
[1:48:19] notice he's come with resurrected saints
[1:48:21] vindicating that his word is true
[1:48:22] satan knows then that the bottomless pit
[1:48:24] is ready for him see oh my
[1:48:26] while death rode the pale horse mixed
[1:48:28] creed and denominations
[1:48:30] and followed him oh my the eternal
[1:48:32] separation from god
[1:48:34] that's where he rode them to eternal
[1:48:36] separation
[1:48:38] christ rode his church
[1:48:46] is christ the white horse rider
[1:48:49] he's talking about the pearl horse rider
[1:48:51] the pale horse rode his
[1:48:53] mixed denomination and creed and
[1:48:54] political he rode them right into
[1:48:56] eternal separation
[1:48:57] but christ the anointed word rode his
[1:49:00] church right into glory in the
[1:49:02] resurrection
[1:49:04] so where is that white horse that white
[1:49:06] horse is the unadulterated word
[1:49:08] he's writing that word and where is that
[1:49:10] word manifest it's in a bride that has
[1:49:12] been brought back to the original
[1:49:14] word in her original condition for
[1:49:15] original purpose and he
[1:49:17] rides his church
[1:49:20] he rides his church amen rides his
[1:49:24] church what is the white horse friends
[1:49:26] what's the white horse you're on the
[1:49:27] word
[1:49:28] what's the white horse he's on the word
[1:49:30] what word the pure word that's been
[1:49:31] restored back which is now
[1:49:33] fine found in a bride on this earth and
[1:49:35] he writes his church
[1:49:37] right into glory in the resurrection
[1:49:41] don't put this in the future friends
[1:49:43] this is now this is happening right now
[1:49:46] the prophet gave us all the indicators
[1:49:48] all the clues all the pieces all the
[1:49:50] scriptures to show you
[1:49:52] spiritually this is a reality right now
[1:49:57] praise god
[1:50:02] i want to read the first seal just bear
[1:50:04] with me i got more to read
[1:50:06] don't go nowhere
[1:50:12] brother graham said the biggest problem
[1:50:14] the church always had is looking back
[1:50:17] the way he's done looking forward and
[1:50:19] missing what he's doing now
[1:50:22] if that's always been the biggest
[1:50:23] problem could it be the biggest problem
[1:50:24] today
[1:50:28] this revelation helps us understand our
[1:50:31] lives this message came to help us
[1:50:32] understand
[1:50:33] who we are and what's going on all
[1:50:35] around us
[1:50:39] the first seal paragraph 271 notice
[1:50:42] now the holy spirit and the revelation
[1:50:44] in christ
[1:50:46] the holy spirit is christ in another
[1:50:48] form
[1:50:49] that's right notice it is a lamb that
[1:50:51] opened the book and the lamb is christ
[1:50:52] and christ is not seen anymore
[1:50:54] from then but he is seen in the book of
[1:50:56] revelation 19th chapter coming on a
[1:50:58] white horse
[1:50:59] now remember the holy ghost in christ is
[1:51:02] the same
[1:51:03] the holy ghost is christ in another form
[1:51:08] so in revelation 19 you see him coming
[1:51:09] on a white horse
[1:51:11] if you'd like to read it let's turn to
[1:51:13] revelation 19 11 to 6.
[1:51:14] let's read it right quick now while
[1:51:16] we're here beginning at the 11th verse
[1:51:18] and
[1:51:19] read down through it says i saw heavens
[1:51:22] open behold a white horse not on earth
[1:51:23] in heaven
[1:51:24] and he that sat on him was called
[1:51:26] faithful true and righteous does he
[1:51:27] judge and make war his eyes were flames
[1:51:29] of fire
[1:51:30] and on his head was crowns look at the
[1:51:32] diadem
[1:51:33] and he had a name written with no man
[1:51:35] known but himself i wish i could stop on
[1:51:37] that just a minute
[1:51:38] and brother branham goes through and he
[1:51:39] starts to explain i won't read it all
[1:51:40] but he starts to explain
[1:51:42] every time there's been a victory
[1:51:44] there's been a battle and a victory a
[1:51:45] name
[1:51:45] changes he shows abram to abraham
[1:51:48] simon to peter saul to paul we went
[1:51:51] through this a couple weeks ago
[1:51:52] so we'll skip past that but i want you
[1:51:54] to understand that went from jacob to
[1:51:56] israel
[1:51:58] he said in jesus his name on earth was
[1:52:00] redeemer jesus
[1:52:02] which he was on earth he was the
[1:52:03] redeemer that's true but when he
[1:52:05] conquered death in hell and overcame
[1:52:06] them and ascended on high
[1:52:08] he received a new name that's the reason
[1:52:10] they holler the way they do
[1:52:12] and they don't get nothing it'll be
[1:52:13] revealed in the thunders
[1:52:22] see he was redeemer he was kinsmen
[1:52:25] redeemer
[1:52:27] amen but then now he's coming his
[1:52:29] bridegroom
[1:52:31] to claim what he's redeemed he's coming
[1:52:35] see he said that's why they don't get
[1:52:37] nothing they're looking at a past
[1:52:39] manifestation
[1:52:41] they're looking at a past work and
[1:52:44] missing his present work he was redeemer
[1:52:46] there on calvary
[1:52:48] he was mediator and kinsman redeemer he
[1:52:50] was a mediator through the church ages
[1:52:53] but they're not catching his current
[1:52:55] work now he's a bridegroom uniting with
[1:52:57] his bride and now he is found in the
[1:52:59] form of his bride
[1:53:00] he has come the head to the body now he
[1:53:03] is on earth
[1:53:04] as mrs jesus christ
[1:53:07] and they're hollering about redeemer all
[1:53:09] redeemer redeemer said they're not
[1:53:10] getting nothing
[1:53:13] that's why they're not getting anything
[1:53:15] it's because they don't know him present
[1:53:17] tense
[1:53:18] they can't get anything from him knowing
[1:53:20] him past tense
[1:53:21] they have to know him present tense and
[1:53:23] present tense he has come in the
[1:53:24] formation of his bride
[1:53:26] it is the word that is returned to the
[1:53:28] church
[1:53:29] the head connected to the body amen the
[1:53:32] full revelation of god the mystery of
[1:53:34] god revealed christ
[1:53:36] now united with his bride that's where
[1:53:38] he is
[1:53:39] that's his new name it didn't change
[1:53:42] jesus christ it's still jesus christ
[1:53:43] that's not that's not it it's he was
[1:53:46] redeemer
[1:53:47] he was mediator now he's husband to the
[1:53:50] bride
[1:53:50] he's now here as mrs jesus christ
[1:53:54] that's why he said it will be revealed
[1:53:56] in the thunders
[1:53:57] what was revealed who you are
[1:54:01] where he's at the coming of the lord and
[1:54:04] where he's at
[1:54:07] i want to read that again when he
[1:54:10] conquered death and helen overcame them
[1:54:11] and they sent him on high he received a
[1:54:12] new name
[1:54:13] that's the reason they'll holler the way
[1:54:14] they do and don't get nothing it'll be
[1:54:16] revealed in the thunders
[1:54:17] notice the mystery he's coming
[1:54:21] that's the mystery he's coming writing
[1:54:25] there's got to be something to change
[1:54:26] this church you know that there's got to
[1:54:28] be something noticed
[1:54:29] no man knowed but himself noticed no man
[1:54:32] known but himself
[1:54:33] he goes back to the scripture he was
[1:54:35] clothed with a vester dipped in blood
[1:54:36] and his name is called the word of god
[1:54:38] oh notice the armies which were in
[1:54:40] heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:54:42] clothed and fine linen white and clean
[1:54:44] and out of his mouth goes the sharp
[1:54:45] sword that with it he should smite the
[1:54:47] nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:54:48] rod of iron
[1:54:49] and he tread the wine press of the
[1:54:51] fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[1:54:53] and he had on his vesture and honest eye
[1:54:55] a name written king of kings and lord of
[1:54:56] lords
[1:54:58] there comes the messiah there he is not
[1:55:00] this fellow on this horse back here
[1:55:03] talking about the original white horse
[1:55:05] rider back in the
[1:55:06] church ages but watch the difference
[1:55:08] here he stands with the book in his hand
[1:55:10] here
[1:55:11] the redemptive work he wasn't took his
[1:55:13] place yet
[1:55:14] so it was not the christ that went forth
[1:55:16] the holy spirit not disagreeing with
[1:55:18] them great men no sir i don't do it
[1:55:20] i wouldn't want to do that but this is
[1:55:22] my to my what my revelation of it is
[1:55:24] if you got something different well
[1:55:25] that's all right but it ain't all right
[1:55:26] with me
[1:55:28] i believe it this way you know you know
[1:55:29] what you know what see and notice christ
[1:55:32] is not seen anymore from that time
[1:55:35] there but he's on a white horse so if
[1:55:36] this guy is riding a white horse
[1:55:38] he's only an impersonator of christ get
[1:55:40] that notice
[1:55:41] the writer on the white horse don't have
[1:55:43] any name he might use two or three
[1:55:45] titles but he wasn't
[1:55:46] got any name but christ has a name what
[1:55:49] is it the word of god
[1:55:51] that's what it is in the beginning was
[1:55:53] the word of god and the word was with
[1:55:54] god and the word was
[1:55:55] was god and the word was made flesh see
[1:55:58] the writer has no name but christ is
[1:55:59] called the word of god that's what he is
[1:56:02] he's called that now he's got a name
[1:56:04] that no man knows but he's called the
[1:56:06] word of god
[1:56:07] this guy isn't called nothing but he's
[1:56:09] on a white horse
[1:56:11] the writer has no arrows for his bow did
[1:56:13] you notice he had a bow but there's
[1:56:14] nothing said about him having any arrows
[1:56:16] so he must be a bluffer
[1:56:18] that's right maybe he's got a lot of
[1:56:20] thunder no lightning but you find out
[1:56:21] christ has both lightning and thunder
[1:56:24] for out of his mouth goes a sharp
[1:56:26] two-edged sword and he smites the
[1:56:27] nations and this guy can't smite nothing
[1:56:30] but he's playing the part of a hypocrite
[1:56:32] he's going forth riding on a white horse
[1:56:34] going out to conquer christ has a sharp
[1:56:37] sword and watch it
[1:56:38] it comes from his mouth the living word
[1:56:41] and that's the word of god revealed to
[1:56:43] his servants
[1:56:46] what's that sword it's a symbol
[1:56:50] do we believe that a physical battle of
[1:56:54] armageddon when jesus comes down
[1:56:56] i meant to save the jews when he comes
[1:56:58] down to destroy all the nations that
[1:57:00] have gathered
[1:57:00] do you think he's going to be on a white
[1:57:01] horse sitting there as a man with a
[1:57:03] giant sword sticking out of his mouth
[1:57:06] and chopping their heads off with that
[1:57:07] sword coming out of his mouth that's a
[1:57:09] cartoon
[1:57:12] that's a horror film this is symbolic
[1:57:15] what does he destroy them with he
[1:57:17] destroys him with his word
[1:57:19] he destroys them with his word amen
[1:57:25] like he said the sharp sword watch
[1:57:28] it comes from his mouth the living word
[1:57:30] that's the word of god
[1:57:32] revealed to his servants
[1:57:36] that's the word of god revealed to his
[1:57:38] servants what's the sharp sword that
[1:57:39] comes out of his mouth the white white
[1:57:41] horse rider
[1:57:42] was a sharp sword that comes out of his
[1:57:43] mouth it's the living word
[1:57:46] the word that's revealed to his servants
[1:57:49] that's why when brother branham was up
[1:57:50] in sabino cannon he had his hand up in
[1:57:52] the air
[1:57:52] and all of a sudden a sword hit his hand
[1:57:54] and what did he say it's the sword of
[1:57:56] the
[1:57:56] king not aching the king's sword and
[1:57:59] that's the same sword that's out of his
[1:58:01] mouth
[1:58:01] is now in the prophet's hand because
[1:58:03] it's the word of the lord it's the word
[1:58:04] that smites the antichrist
[1:58:06] it's the word that brings the
[1:58:07] destruction
[1:58:09] it's the word that destroys his kingdom
[1:58:11] amen
[1:58:12] and now it's the word of god revealed to
[1:58:15] his servants
[1:58:15] like he said to moses go stand there and
[1:58:17] hold that stick out yonder call for
[1:58:19] flies
[1:58:20] and there was sure whatever he said he'd
[1:58:21] done it and it come to pass
[1:58:23] his living word god and his word as the
[1:58:26] self-same person
[1:58:28] god is the word
[1:58:35] praise god brother bram says in the
[1:58:37] fourth seal
[1:58:40] he said
[1:58:44] he i had to go different parts of the
[1:58:45] scripture to prove these things so that
[1:58:47] that's the reason i went to revelation
[1:58:49] 19 to show the end of the antichrist
[1:58:50] will be the slaying
[1:58:52] of christ when he comes he will slay the
[1:58:55] antichrist
[1:58:57] when he comes he will slay the
[1:58:58] antichrist how will he slay the
[1:59:00] antichrist
[1:59:00] not riding on a physical horse with a
[1:59:02] sword sticking out of his mouth because
[1:59:04] the antichrist is a spirit
[1:59:06] you can't kill the spirit with a
[1:59:08] physical sword
[1:59:10] you can't chase a spirit with a physical
[1:59:12] horse
[1:59:14] but how does he come when he comes how
[1:59:16] does he come he comes
[1:59:17] as the word of god and he comes as the
[1:59:20] word and the word was placed in the
[1:59:22] prophet's hand
[1:59:23] and the prophet went out and he broke
[1:59:24] the seals he revealed the word the sharp
[1:59:26] sword was coming out of christ's mouth
[1:59:29] and what was he doing
[1:59:31] he was smiting the antichrist in the
[1:59:33] opening of the seals
[1:59:37] when christ comes he will slay the
[1:59:39] antichrist
[1:59:40] for his bride the antichrist has been
[1:59:42] slain
[1:59:44] the creeds and the dogmas and all the
[1:59:46] false things of the antichrist the word
[1:59:48] of god has come to slay that antichrist
[1:59:50] and he's still slaying it
[1:59:56] brother says in the second seal
[1:59:59] we're winding down stay with me
[2:00:03] do we want to do jumping jacks push-ups
[2:00:08] now now remember he's got a sword he's
[2:00:10] going forth
[2:00:11] a sword in his hand riding red horse
[2:00:14] he's talking about the red horse rider
[2:00:16] wading through the blood of everybody
[2:00:17] that disagrees with him now do you
[2:00:19] understand
[2:00:20] how many understands what the seal is
[2:00:22] now now what did jesus say
[2:00:25] it take he that they that take the sword
[2:00:27] will perish by the sword is that right
[2:00:29] all right all right this rider and all
[2:00:31] his kingdom
[2:00:32] subjects that are slain down through the

[2:03:30] horse and the followers of heaven

[2:03:35] question
[2:03:38] are you a follower from heaven follower
[2:03:40] of heaven
[2:03:42] are you a heaven-born subject are you
[2:03:45] have you been called by the god last
[2:03:47] gospel trump at the seventh trumpet
[2:03:50] are you called to be an invincible
[2:03:52] warrior
[2:03:54] are you called in the army of god have
[2:03:55] you been given armament it's
[2:03:57] nothing to do with flesh it's all about
[2:03:59] the word
[2:04:00] and it's all about the word and you and
[2:04:02] i brother brahm says in christ as the
[2:04:04] mystery of god revealed oh
[2:04:06] if i could get the world to see that why
[2:04:09] there you are there is the body of
[2:04:10] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[2:04:13] oh my
[2:04:14] justified in his sight why are we
[2:04:16] justified we are his victory
[2:04:18] the church is his victory
[2:04:21] we come forth in this last days with
[2:04:23] this glorious gospel
[2:04:24] showing his victory he died for this
[2:04:26] purpose and we are proof of his victory
[2:04:29] when we when we see him coming down and
[2:04:31] living among the church that's his
[2:04:32] victory
[2:04:33] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[2:04:34] grave neither can they keep us
[2:04:36] that's right and we're already
[2:04:38] potentially arise because we've raised
[2:04:40] from the dead unbelief in his word
[2:04:42] from denominational creeds to an eternal
[2:04:44] word of the eternal god
[2:04:46] which is him his self working through us
[2:04:49] manifesting himself that he is the same
[2:04:52] yesterday today
[2:04:53] and forever and when the word moves on
[2:04:55] down into the body from the head what is
[2:04:57] it
[2:04:58] the same word nothing can be added or
[2:05:00] taken from it so that same word moves
[2:05:02] from the head as the day comes close
[2:05:04] down into the body down into the body
[2:05:06] vindicating that they are one
[2:05:07] they are husband and wife they are flesh
[2:05:10] of his flesh
[2:05:11] word of his word life of his life spirit
[2:05:13] of a spirit
[2:05:14] amen how do you know it bears the same
[2:05:17] record same fruit same word see
[2:05:19] manifest christ the same life same god
[2:05:21] same spirit
[2:05:22] same word same book amen same signs
[2:05:26] things that i do show you do also oh
[2:05:28] hallelujah my
[2:05:30] notice the vindicated word in his body
[2:05:33] is his very victory and the reason of
[2:05:35] his death
[2:05:37] see the death not in the spirit when he
[2:05:39] died he only died in the flesh
[2:05:40] his spirit went to hell and preached to
[2:05:42] the souls in prison that's right his
[2:05:44] flesh only died when he raised it up
[2:05:45] again and quickened it
[2:05:47] quicken means made alive his flesh which
[2:05:49] was his body
[2:05:50] and that's the word it's been laying
[2:05:52] dead for years
[2:05:55] now we're coming to christ's body in the
[2:05:57] resurrection
[2:05:58] he shows that his physical body the one
[2:06:01] that walked by the sea of galilee
[2:06:03] it died and it went to the grave his
[2:06:05] body amen his spirit didn't die but his
[2:06:08] body
[2:06:08] died went to the grave but it was
[2:06:09] resurrected after three days
[2:06:12] but now he's going right to the body
[2:06:15] which is
[2:06:16] his church which is the bride and he's
[2:06:18] is the word he said that's the word it's
[2:06:19] been laying
[2:06:20] dead for years but it gradually began to
[2:06:24] come in the reformation
[2:06:25] and now she is standing upon her feet
[2:06:29] what is that it's the body of jesus
[2:06:31] christ resurrected
[2:06:33] he brought the bride back in the
[2:06:35] restoration of the bride tree i'm
[2:06:36] telling you friends the capstone
[2:06:38] ministry is here
[2:06:39] she is standing on her feet she has
[2:06:42] gradually come back from the reformation
[2:06:44] but she is here she is here he is here
[2:06:48] he is here in her she is here he is here
[2:06:52] if she has the fullness of the word then
[2:06:53] he is here if he is here
[2:06:55] we're in him he's in her all the host of
[2:06:58] heaven is here because heaven consists
[2:06:59] of the word and the word is here
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:03] where's the battle here
[2:07:07] what's the fight over that revelation
[2:07:09] christ in you
[2:07:10] amen christ in you the revelation of the
[2:07:13] whole thing
[2:07:16] he says she's standing upon her feet
[2:07:20] unless he said that's the word his body
[2:07:22] the word
[2:07:23] it's been laying dead for years why
[2:07:26] creeds and dogmas denominations
[2:07:30] but it gradually began to come in the
[2:07:31] reformation and now she's standing
[2:07:33] upon her feet oh how i wish i had time
[2:07:36] to go back into ezekiel
[2:07:40] look at where he goes he said oh how i
[2:07:42] wish i had time to go back into ezekiel
[2:07:44] and pull out them dry bones
[2:07:47] and show you can these bones live again
[2:07:49] he said prophesy
[2:07:51] how can prophecy come only through a
[2:07:53] prophet it's the word of the lord
[2:07:54] hear you dry bones the word of the lord
[2:07:56] and sin your skin came upon them and
[2:07:58] they stood up a mighty army and began to
[2:08:00] march toward zion glory to god that's
[2:08:02] him
[2:08:02] that's him the victory what's him
[2:08:06] what is him he's showing it it's an
[2:08:08] ezekiel dry bones
[2:08:09] he said the church went down through
[2:08:11] four messengers through
[2:08:12] for the the locust the palmer worm the
[2:08:14] cankerworm amen oh
[2:08:15] it ate down the bride tree because the
[2:08:17] bride drew came forth the glorious bride
[2:08:19] tree but she never fulfilled her purpose
[2:08:21] before she fell
[2:08:23] like eve never fulfilled a purpose
[2:08:24] before she fell and now
[2:08:26] through four stages it ate down and it
[2:08:27] went to utter death in the dark ages
[2:08:29] only a little life left in the root
[2:08:32] but through the reformation through
[2:08:33] luther through wesley through pentecost
[2:08:35] he's brought
[2:08:36] it up through three stages but the
[2:08:37] fourth stage is he himself
[2:08:40] and what's he saying he says that's him
[2:08:43] that's him
[2:08:44] that's the victory what is it it's his
[2:08:46] body
[2:08:47] coming in the resurrection
[2:08:51] just like the first time it was typed
[2:08:53] when jesus resurrected from the dead
[2:08:55] now his body the word the word bride
[2:08:58] is resurrecting like ezekiel's dry bones
[2:09:00] and what did they resurrect as friends
[2:09:02] what did they come back as
[2:09:04] those bones went down they were dry you
[2:09:06] couldn't recognize them you didn't know
[2:09:08] what they were
[2:09:09] remember when the prophecy came when the
[2:09:11] word came through a prophet
[2:09:12] bone came to bone sin you in flesh and
[2:09:14] they rose up and then the wind came the
[2:09:16] fourth stage was the very life itself
[2:09:18] [Music]
[2:09:20] justification sanctification baptism in
[2:09:22] the holy ghost to the person of the holy
[2:09:24] ghost himself
[2:09:26] and in the fourth stage what had been
[2:09:28] bound for nearly 2000 years is now
[2:09:29] loosed
[2:09:30] by the evening time message back in the
[2:09:32] bride again
[2:09:33] and what did they come back as they come
[2:09:36] back
[2:09:36] as an army they come back as an army
[2:09:41] why these four stages was bringing the
[2:09:43] army back
[2:09:44] to what to fight the battle to forgive
[2:09:46] the final blow to antichrist to defeat
[2:09:49] him for the gentile bride
[2:09:53] praise be to god
[2:09:57] god is good friends thank you for
[2:10:00] bearing with me
[2:10:01] i want to go through a couple slides and
[2:10:03] i'll pull us the highlights because i
[2:10:04] want us to capture what we talked about
[2:10:07] let's look at a few things here i'm just
[2:10:10] pulled little excerpts out of quotes
[2:10:16] may the holy spirit come down now the
[2:10:18] white horse rider
[2:10:21] there's only one original color anything
[2:10:23] else is mixed christ is on a solid white
[2:10:26] unadulterated word from the beginning i
[2:10:29] hope that we can get away from
[2:10:30] traditional thinking
[2:10:32] traditional denominational thinking and
[2:10:35] listen to what the prophet is saying
[2:10:37] how is he describing these things how is
[2:10:39] he timing it what scriptures is he using
[2:10:41] what terms is he using let's look at
[2:10:43] what he's saying and when i do this i'm
[2:10:45] not denying it all a physical
[2:10:46] manifestation of a battle of armageddon
[2:10:48] in palestine i'm not saying that
[2:10:52] but let's think about that do you really
[2:10:54] think in that physical manifestation
[2:10:55] that jesus will come from heaven riding
[2:10:57] on a white horse with a sword out of his
[2:10:58] mouth and he's cutting the heads off all
[2:11:00] the captains
[2:11:02] no in israel every time god says you
[2:11:06] don't fight i'll fight for you
[2:11:08] what did he do did they see anything
[2:11:10] they didn't see anything
[2:11:11] what he did is he calls them to run away
[2:11:12] afraid he calls them to turn their
[2:11:14] swords on each other and kill each other
[2:11:15] amen that's how he comes and fights when
[2:11:18] god fights amen
[2:11:19] that's how he fights they never saw
[2:11:22] god god said you stay behind the walls
[2:11:25] i'll destroy this enemy you'll not see
[2:11:26] them no longer
[2:11:28] and they caused a noise they heard a
[2:11:30] noise they got scared they turned their
[2:11:31] swords on each other
[2:11:32] and this may just meet brother chad but
[2:11:34] i don't believe amen
[2:11:36] even in a physical manifestation
[2:11:37] gathered in palestine that you're going
[2:11:39] to see a white horse
[2:11:40] and a giant jesus with a giant sword out
[2:11:42] of his mouth hitting everybody
[2:11:45] but his word has already prophesied
[2:11:47] their demise his word has already
[2:11:49] prophesied their doom
[2:11:50] when they gather together in a
[2:11:51] fulfillment of the word the word is
[2:11:53] going to slay them
[2:11:55] and they i believe they're going to turn
[2:11:57] their swords on each other and fire
[2:11:58] nuclear bombs at one another
[2:12:01] cause volcanoes they'll go up and
[2:12:02] destroy the earth with fire because god
[2:12:05] brother man said god doesn't god god
[2:12:07] doesn't destroy man man destroys himself
[2:12:10] and he said man will create his own hell
[2:12:13] a burning fiery hell upon this earth
[2:12:16] amen before
[2:12:17] the millennial reign that's just me
[2:12:20] that's just bonus
[2:12:22] sorry there's only one original color
[2:12:26] anything else is mixed christ is on a
[2:12:27] solid white unadulterated word
[2:12:30] from the beginning christ rode his
[2:12:33] church right into glory
[2:12:34] in the resurrection revelation 19 the
[2:12:38] next time the church is hurt she comes
[2:12:39] also
[2:12:40] not upon exactly horses
[2:12:44] christ has a sharp sword and watch it
[2:12:46] comes from his mouth
[2:12:47] the living word that's the word of god
[2:12:49] revealed to his servants
[2:12:51] and when christ comes with the sword for
[2:12:53] it is his word that proceeds out of his
[2:12:55] mouth
[2:12:56] he will slay every enemy there is before
[2:12:58] him
[2:13:00] and the same word will rise in power
[2:13:02] coming forth from his lips of jesus
[2:13:04] christ
[2:13:05] and it shall slay him and everything
[2:13:06] before him
[2:13:09] and christ is gathering his heaven-born
[2:13:12] subjects
[2:13:13] saints under what he's gathering them
[2:13:15] under the last
[2:13:16] trumpet the final trumpet the seventh
[2:13:19] trumpet from the seventh angel
[2:13:21] when he comes he's going to be called
[2:13:23] the word of god
[2:13:24] riding upon a white horse and the
[2:13:26] followers of heaven will be
[2:13:27] behind him if you're an ambassador from
[2:13:31] heaven
[2:13:32] all heaven's behind you in heaven is
[2:13:35] consisted of the word
[2:13:39] let all those things soak in say what
[2:13:42] brother
[2:13:42] i'm talking about he's talking about a
[2:13:45] battle that's going on now
[2:13:48] the trumpet sounded heaven was open
[2:13:50] christ the word has returned
[2:13:53] the holy spirit is here he's riding his
[2:13:56] church
[2:13:56] in the resurrection was he resurrected
[2:13:58] or he's resurrected or out of dead
[2:14:00] denominationalism he has resurrected
[2:14:02] saints
[2:14:03] i believe wholeheartedly in a physical
[2:14:05] resurrection with all my heart i believe
[2:14:06] the elements will come back together
[2:14:08] that were ordained to be those saints
[2:14:10] and they will rise and we will see them
[2:14:12] in a physical form but i'm telling you
[2:14:14] the church has resurrected
[2:14:16] the bride has come back the church has
[2:14:19] resurrected out of dead denomination
[2:14:21] we've come to the fourth stage the
[2:14:22] capstone
[2:14:23] the fourth stage of the journey when his
[2:14:25] life has come back in and she's rose a
[2:14:27] mighty marching army that has gathered
[2:14:29] under the last trumpet and she's now
[2:14:31] fighting the devil with the sword of the
[2:14:33] spirit
[2:14:35] the word of the lord don't miss the
[2:14:37] battle friends
[2:14:39] it's not about anything in the flesh
[2:14:42] this battle has come down to your
[2:14:44] personal revelation of jesus christ
[2:14:48] and your relationship with him who you
[2:14:50] are who he is in you you and him him and
[2:14:53] you
[2:14:53] not the tangible things but the
[2:14:55] invisible things have to become the
[2:14:57] reality today
[2:14:58] that's the gentile way and i'll read
[2:15:02] this last scripture
[2:15:04] and the god of peace shall bruce satan
[2:15:06] under your feet
[2:15:07] shortly bruise
[2:15:10] to break into shivers to tear apart to
[2:15:13] destroy
[2:15:14] he will do that how under your feet
[2:15:18] shortly the grace of our lord jesus
[2:15:21] christ be
[2:15:22] with you amen let's all stand
[2:15:25] musicians if you could come
[2:15:29] good like
[2:15:33] what happened at the opening of the
[2:15:34] seals
[2:15:36] the trumpet blew it declared spiritual
[2:15:39] war
[2:15:41] but which war not another battle
[2:15:44] not another battle in the string of
[2:15:45] battles but the last battle
[2:15:48] the last face off the last fight the
[2:15:50] last war for the gentile bride
[2:15:52] and christ will be victorious because
[2:15:54] he's come down
[2:15:56] with a sword in his mouth which is the
[2:15:58] living word that he's given to his
[2:15:59] servants
[2:16:00] because that sword came into the hand of
[2:16:02] a prophet and that sword that comes out
[2:16:04] of his mouth
[2:16:05] is now in the bride and what are you
[2:16:08] supposed to do with it
[2:16:10] destroy the antichrist what's christ
[2:16:13] coming to do destroy the antichrist
[2:16:15] where is he going to do it where is he
[2:16:18] going to do it
[2:16:19] what horse is he riding where is he
[2:16:22] going to destroy
[2:16:23] what vessel is he going to use he's
[2:16:24] going to destroy it with this vessel
[2:16:26] right here he's going to use
[2:16:27] me he's going to use me to destroy the
[2:16:29] antichrist every time i face the
[2:16:31] antichrist
[2:16:32] the word will destroy the antichrist
[2:16:34] what is the antichrist the antichrist is
[2:16:36] not the banker
[2:16:38] the antichrist is not a government
[2:16:39] official the antichrist is not
[2:16:41] a hostile cohort the antichrist is not
[2:16:44] an unruly loved one the antichrist is
[2:16:46] anything that's against the word
[2:16:49] and we've been given a sword he's come
[2:16:51] with a sword out of his mouth a living
[2:16:53] word amen given to his servants amen and
[2:16:56] now that word is in the bride and christ
[2:16:58] is here the holy ghost is here the white
[2:16:59] horse rider
[2:17:01] to do what to slay the antichrist the
[2:17:04] slain with what
[2:17:05] with the word that's why brother brenham
[2:17:08] said she'll have the word
[2:17:10] and the word only no more reasoning
[2:17:14] no more church doctrine no more
[2:17:16] denominational understanding
[2:17:18] but the word and the word only will slay
[2:17:21] the antichrist
[2:17:23] when the last one comes in
[2:17:27] and everything is finished the
[2:17:29] antichrist spirit's been destroyed from
[2:17:31] off the
[2:17:32] away from the bride
[2:17:35] then those elements of the ground
[2:17:38] that were meant to be our brothers and
[2:17:40] sisters or form bodies again
[2:17:43] and they will come up out of the graves
[2:17:47] i'm looking to do my part now
[2:17:52] i've heard the trumpet i've heard the
[2:17:54] call
[2:17:55] and i said god use me lord i can do
[2:17:58] nothing in myself
[2:18:00] i'll tell you something that's
[2:18:01] interesting it's not you it's him
[2:18:06] but it's you but it's him
[2:18:09] but it's you but it's him do you
[2:18:12] understand what i'm saying
[2:18:14] we know we can't do it we know we're
[2:18:15] incapable we know we're a failure to
[2:18:17] begin with
[2:18:17] we know that we're going to mess it up
[2:18:19] but yet he said i'm going to do it
[2:18:21] through you
[2:18:21] nobody else it's you but it's him but
[2:18:24] he's going to use you but it's him it's
[2:18:26] not you it's him but he's doing
[2:18:27] using you that's why brother barron said
[2:18:30] i'm not the one who did those things i'm
[2:18:31] not the one
[2:18:32] i was only standing near when he did it
[2:18:35] the man said i can't discern the
[2:18:36] thoughts and because i can't tell you
[2:18:37] where you were yesterday i can't
[2:18:38] i can't know your name it has to be him
[2:18:40] doing it but yet he did it through the
[2:18:42] prophet it was the prophet
[2:18:44] but it was him but it was him but it was
[2:18:47] brother branham but it was brother but
[2:18:48] it was him
[2:18:49] and it's the same relationship today
[2:18:51] it's you it's in you it's through you
[2:18:53] it's with you
[2:18:54] god is riding you he's using you to
[2:18:56] accomplish this purpose in this day
[2:18:57] the word is in you the holy spirit is
[2:18:59] upon you christ himself
[2:19:01] is using his bride this day to defeat
[2:19:03] his enemy but it's not you
[2:19:05] but it's you but it's not you
[2:19:08] oh my what a paradox man he's got to
[2:19:11] have you he's ordained you
[2:19:13] it's going to happen through you amen
[2:19:15] but it's not going to be you doing it
[2:19:17] it's going to be him
[2:19:17] doing it through you that's why brother
[2:19:20] branham amen he wouldn't use his own
[2:19:22] mind any time he tried to use his own
[2:19:24] reasoning he got himself in trouble and
[2:19:25] he would come back and tell you what he
[2:19:27] did wrong
[2:19:29] he had to get to a place where he was
[2:19:31] surrendered where it wasn't him
[2:19:32] it was christ through him and it's not
[2:19:36] going to be
[2:19:36] us this man here this man here it's
[2:19:39] going to be christ
[2:19:40] working in the part of his word he's
[2:19:42] ordained for this day christ in you the
[2:19:44] hope of glory
[2:19:47] let him do it stay with the word
[2:19:50] recognize your position
[2:19:52] make your calling and election sure for
[2:19:54] the battle is over your revelation
[2:19:57] of who you are who christ is in this day
[2:20:00] and the battles over that revelation and
[2:20:03] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:20:06] lord jesus i pray god that you would

[2:21:02] in every situation help us to take your
[2:21:05] word for everything in our life
[2:21:07] and help us to overcome by the word lord

[2:21:29] you would come lord
[2:21:30] in their hour of desperation and i pray

[2:25:50] every antichrist spirit with the sword
[2:25:52] of the spirit this will be an invincible
[2:25:54] army
[2:25:54] an antichrist will be thoroughly
[2:25:56] completely defeated by the word of god
[2:25:59] [Music]
[2:26:02] she and the word are so much alike until

[2:26:12] what christ revealed to you let it be
[2:26:14] true don't let your mind resist it don't
[2:26:17] let your mistakes
[2:26:18] uh take you away from it but let what
[2:26:21] christ has said about you and what he's
[2:26:22] revealed in your heart
[2:26:23] let it be the truth that i am part of
[2:26:27] this bride
