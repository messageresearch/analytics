[14:37] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may God
[14:41] bless you you can have your seats for a
[14:43] little while thank you musicians God
[14:46] bless you as you know we're going to uh
[14:48] start our tape service every winter we
[14:50] like to uh do a tape together we do at
[14:53] least one in a year there's been years
[14:55] we've done more than one and uh a few
[14:57] Wednesdays back we got to listen to the
[14:59] life story brother brandom and I
[15:01] certainly enjoyed that there's something
[15:03] really special about listening together
[15:05] we listen to tapes all the time and we
[15:07] read books all the time but there's
[15:08] something about an atmosphere that you
[15:10] just can't change and and it's so
[15:12] exciting to come together to be in this
[15:14] atmosphere of worship and to listen to
[15:16] The Prophet's voice together for we know
[15:18] that that mouthpiece with the mouthpiece
[15:20] God used to bring the message in the end
[15:22] time and we thank God for that um I want
[15:26] to pull up the PowerPoint and we'll get
[15:28] started with this uh I want to do just a
[15:31] little bit of review every year when we
[15:33] go through this we come to this time
[15:35] we've always got new people who have
[15:36] been added amongst us in Fellowship so I
[15:38] want to do just a little bit of review
[15:40] for their sake and we always got
[15:41] youngsters coming up and now now the
[15:44] those who are starting to get older
[15:45] their light bulbs are coming on and
[15:47] they're starting to get interested in
[15:48] other things and and we always want to
[15:50] review for their sakes as well and so if
[15:53] you if you know about I think it been
[15:55] about 7 years ago the trustees hung this
[15:58] rack
[15:59] they built it brother Elmer built it for
[16:01] us and they hung it in the in the out in
[16:03] the for you here as you go out the doors
[16:05] and on this rack there's uh 12 spots for
[16:08] books the the top section never changes
[16:12] it's the same set of six books that
[16:14] hasn't changed in seven years and
[16:16] there's a reason for that these are the
[16:18] titles on that top section the spoken
[16:21] word is the Original Seed the present
[16:24] stage of my Ministry is this the sign of
[16:26] the end sir the breach between the seven
[16:29] Church ages and the Seven Seals the
[16:31] seventh seal and Christ is the mystery
[16:33] of God revealed the reason we leave
[16:35] those up there all the time is because
[16:37] back when we first put the rack up I
[16:39] asked everybody in the church to read
[16:41] through these six titles and read
[16:43] through them in this order because if
[16:44] you watch this order it takes you from
[16:47] it takes you from
[16:48] 1962 all the way to July of 1963 and if
[16:52] you follow those sermons through you see
[16:54] the transition in brother bram's
[16:55] Ministry and you see amen him move into
[16:58] that that what God called him for to be
[17:00] the seventh Church age messenger and to
[17:02] fulfill Mal Revelation 10 1:7 and so
[17:06] it's a very very important transition
[17:08] and so that's why we have those titles
[17:10] so if if you're new or if you're a young
[17:13] person or you're here fellow shipping
[17:14] you've never read through those one by
[17:16] one in that order I encourage you to do
[17:18] so it's uh it's very encouraging to do
[17:21] so it's very eye openening to to go
[17:23] through that in that order and if you
[17:25] haven't done it for 7 years it might be
[17:27] a good idea to do it again amen I love
[17:30] it I love doing that and then on the
[17:33] bottom rack on the bottom section of
[17:35] this rack we have six titles that change
[17:38] every so often periodically they changed
[17:40] for the next few months they're going to
[17:42] remain the same because every year I get
[17:43] six new titles to fill this so we've
[17:46] ordered six new titles brother uh John
[17:48] pittsenbarger helps me and he's ordered
[17:50] the books and and put them in there and
[17:52] those in the library keep them full so
[17:54] for several months we'll have six new
[17:56] titles this will be the new titles the
[17:58] restoration of the brid tree wisdom
[18:01] versus Faith the flashing red light of
[18:03] his coming the Third Exodus Harvest Time
[18:07] and Easter
[18:08] seal now like I've said several times I
[18:12] encourage everyone to get these books
[18:14] it's been interesting now over the last
[18:16] six or seven years however long it's
[18:17] been we've been we've been bringing
[18:19] these titles in every year we bring in
[18:21] more and it's amazing if you've been
[18:24] here from the beginning and followed
[18:25] along you now have a nice library of
[18:27] these message books all of your own so
[18:29] if you're a young person who started
[18:31] years ago now every young person in the
[18:33] church and every young adult has their
[18:35] own library of message books but
[18:37] remember I made a stipulation I have a
[18:39] request I request that you only take one
[18:42] or two at a time don't go get all six
[18:44] new ones we'll keep it full we'll make
[18:46] sure we order as long as voice of God
[18:48] has them we'll order them you're not
[18:50] going to run out but just take one or
[18:52] two and when you're done reading those
[18:54] get one or two more when you're done
[18:57] reading those get one or or two more cuz
[18:59] the problem is if you go and grab 10
[19:00] titles you may have a title in there for
[19:03] two or three years that you never read
[19:05] but now if you do it this way by the
[19:07] time you can look over at at your
[19:09] bookshelf and you've read every title
[19:11] every book you've had you've read
[19:13] yourself I think that's Paramount and
[19:16] now as we add these six new titles we
[19:18] now have 53 titles that we keep here all
[19:20] the time in the library so by the grace
[19:22] of God we built that from year to year
[19:25] uh and so we know that there's an
[19:27] electronic form of everything you can go
[19:30] on the uh on the website and listen you
[19:32] can download on your phone tablets
[19:34] computer there's a there's a myriad of
[19:36] ways to listen to the message and to
[19:38] read it but there's something about a
[19:41] book I like a book and so I'm happy that
[19:45] we're still able to have them and still
[19:47] able to have them here for anybody who
[19:49] would like to have one as well all the
[19:52] rest of those titles are in the library
[19:54] so if you walk in the door this is the
[19:56] the shelving uh system right there in
[19:57] front of you you to the right uh all the
[19:59] books are there and if you turn around
[20:01] look behind the door there's been some
[20:02] more added to this since this picture
[20:04] and that's where you'll find all those
[20:06] titles that aren't out on the rack so if
[20:08] you're looking for a book we've got 53
[20:10] titles here hopefully we've got
[20:12] something that you're looking for and
[20:14] that you can have you're also welcome to
[20:17] take these anytime along with anything
[20:18] else in the library if you want to share
[20:20] a book with somebody you want to share
[20:22] it with a friend a coworker somebody
[20:24] you're witnessing to or somebody that
[20:25] you know just would benefit from that
[20:27] feel free to grab one and just give it
[20:29] to them that we don't we don't uh we
[20:32] don't sell anything out of the library
[20:34] it's just there for you to take take the
[20:36] book witness pass it out use it amen all
[20:40] the funds for these books come from the
[20:41] general fund so if you want to make a
[20:43] contribution if you take several books
[20:45] just drop it in the offering in the
[20:46] general fund and that'll cover it but we
[20:49] want there there's no it's no good
[20:51] having thousands of books sit on a shelf
[20:55] they're there to be read to be fed upon
[20:58] so that we all can grow so we have them
[21:00] there to be used so take advantage of
[21:04] that uh so tonight we're going to go
[21:08] into the Masterpiece this is actually a
[21:10] book that we got several years ago we've
[21:12] had the book here for a while but we've
[21:14] never used it in a tape service so we're
[21:17] going to go through the Masterpiece if
[21:19] everybody who has a book grab your book
[21:22] we're going to we're going to look at
[21:23] this book now um uh the deacons told me
[21:26] that we ran out of books and I'm very
[21:28] sorry for that but uh brother John said
[21:30] he can have some here by next Wednesday
[21:32] so if you weren't able to grab a book we
[21:33] will have physical books here uh by next
[21:37] Wednesday so that everybody can have one
[21:39] so if you look at the front of the book
[21:42] it's got the title which is the
[21:44] Masterpiece up in the upper leftand
[21:45] corner it says
[21:48] 64705 that means this was preached in
[21:51] 1964 July 5th
[21:54] 0705 July 5th
[21:56] 1964 I
[21:58] as I say every year I'm going to repeat
[22:00] myself for many of you but for some this
[22:02] will be new first time that you hear
[22:03] this whenever I grab a book and pick it
[22:06] up I don't just want to just grab and
[22:09] start reading but I want to know where
[22:11] this is placed in the sequence of events
[22:13] where it falls into the timeline of the
[22:15] message is this pre seals is this during
[22:18] the first pool or second pool or after
[22:20] the third pool is where where are we at
[22:23] where is brother brandom at in his
[22:24] ministry and what is he trying what what
[22:27] is God trying to tell me in this book I
[22:29] just don't want to read it so I can
[22:30] check it off my list I've checked that
[22:31] book off and read it now I can put it on
[22:33] my shelf but I want to know what God's
[22:35] trying to tell me in this message and so
[22:38] then we look at the title the title is
[22:40] the Masterpiece and I hold that in my
[22:43] heart the whole time I'm reading this
[22:44] book and in my mind because that's what
[22:46] brother brandom is preaching about the
[22:47] Masterpiece and if you look at the title
[22:50] it says the
[22:52] Masterpiece it doesn't say the
[22:55] masterpieces it's singular the
[22:57] masterpiece piece and it's important
[22:59] that you grab this and hold this in your
[23:00] mind because you know that he's going to
[23:02] be talking to about more than one image
[23:05] one more than one H uh I don't know how
[23:09] to say so I don't want to spill the
[23:10] beans but the the Masterpiece isn't just
[23:12] one vessel but he shows that there's
[23:14] more than one vessel in the Masterpiece
[23:16] but it's still one Masterpiece one work
[23:19] of art that he's working on so that's
[23:21] important so if we open up the just turn
[23:25] the cover you have the cover page turn
[23:27] that one once more and look on the
[23:28] inside onto the left and once again
[23:31] you'll have the title The Masterpiece
[23:33] you have the date then also it'll it'll
[23:36] say here that this message by Brother
[23:38] William BR Mariam brandham was delivered
[23:40] on Sunday morning July 5th 1964 at
[23:43] branam Tabernacle in Jeffersonville
[23:45] Indiana USA the tape number
[23:48] 64705 is 2 hours and 18 minutes so I
[23:52] always look at this I always flip it
[23:54] open and look at this because I want to
[23:56] know also where he preached it because
[24:00] many times brother bham will use
[24:02] terminology and he will use phrases to
[24:04] relate to the people he's preaching to
[24:06] is he at a Full Gospel businessman
[24:08] association meeting is a Pentecostal
[24:10] church is he in a big Gathering of
[24:12] different churches is where where is he
[24:14] at or is he at his home Church in
[24:15] Jeffersonville and many times you'll
[24:17] notice that brother Brenham will tailor
[24:18] his message and use certain terminology
[24:21] and phrases to relate to the people that
[24:23] he's preaching to so I always want to
[24:25] know where he's preaching it where it
[24:27] falls in the timeline of the ministry
[24:29] where it's at and it's always nice to
[24:30] know how long it is amen so it's going
[24:34] to take us three services to get through
[24:37] uh today will just be an introduction
[24:39] we'll get just we'll just start getting
[24:40] into the meat of it and then we'll have
[24:42] to stop but it'll lay a foundation so
[24:45] they come along the next two times and
[24:47] and really pour into it and pour over
[24:50] it um see what else I want to
[24:54] say we are going to begin at page one
[24:57] paragraph one we're going to listen to
[24:58] the tape in its
[25:00] entirety and we're going to go to page
[25:03] to the bottom of page 11 all the way to
[25:05] the very last word in page 11 is where
[25:08] we're the what we hope to cover today
[25:10] and what we intend to cover
[25:13] today all
[25:17] right let me see here if there's
[25:20] anything else I want to cover okay I'm
[25:23] going to go over questions now uh those
[25:26] of you are new our our habit here our
[25:29] tradition and custom here is that I will
[25:31] ask questions and I'm I'm going to ask
[25:35] four questions here and those questions
[25:37] brother Brenham will answer in the
[25:38] segment that we're going to listen to
[25:40] they're not trick questions they're not
[25:42] they're not there to stumble you it it's
[25:43] just a a question I'm going to ask the
[25:45] question and as we follow through and
[25:47] the reason I initially started doing
[25:49] this is really for the young people who
[25:51] just started feeding on the message
[25:53] themselves I want them to learn how to
[25:55] get the answers to the questions out of
[25:57] the message I want them to to know learn
[26:00] how to feed not to read like we're
[26:01] reading a newspaper but really feed on
[26:03] what God is telling us and really take
[26:05] it in and let it shape our understanding
[26:07] and let it reveal to us the word of God
[26:10] and so I'm going to ask these questions
[26:11] and we'll all be listening carefully and
[26:13] even you youngsters you those of you are
[26:15] Sunday school age amen you can answer
[26:18] these questions too and you might find
[26:20] the answer faster than mom or dad so you
[26:22] might just
[26:24] win so that'll be good you'll have
[26:26] bragging rights when you get home
[26:28] tonight so let's go to the questions
[26:33] now question number one where did
[26:36] Michelangelo get the image of
[26:41] Moses where did he get the image of
[26:43] Moses the one he used to make the
[26:46] Masterpiece where did Michelangelo get
[26:49] the image of
[26:56] Moses
[27:02] number two why did he strike the
[27:06] sculpture why did he strike the
[27:17] sculpture some of you you've listened to
[27:19] several times you you already know the
[27:21] answer but hey praise the Lord thank God
[27:26] we can hear it again
[27:28] amen number three what made it a
[27:30] masterpiece to brother
[27:34] brandham what was it that made it a
[27:36] masterpiece to brother
[27:56] brandham
[28:00] and number four what was wrong with
[28:03] God's first Masterpiece that's an odd
[28:05] question I'm not saying that it was
[28:07] wrong but you'll understand as we get
[28:09] into the message I didn't know how else
[28:11] to word it what was wrong with God's
[28:13] first
[28:26] masterpiece
[28:33] all right many of you remember that
[28:35] there's been um a few times here that
[28:38] we've read through uh and listened to or
[28:41] read through a private interview that
[28:42] brother bandham did and I just used it I
[28:45] don't know maybe a month ago or month
[28:47] and a half ago in services and it's the
[28:49] private interview with sister Bruce
[28:51] sister uh Georgia Bruce I believe or
[28:54] yeah I believe that's her name and
[28:55] sister Bruce and it's about she has a
[28:57] questions about uh having the baptism of
[28:59] Holy Ghost and she needs healing for her
[29:00] heart if you'll remember that and and so
[29:03] sister Bruce actually met brother
[29:05] brandom in his office right before he
[29:07] came out to preach this message and he's
[29:09] going to refer to that so it's really
[29:12] interesting to know what brother Brenham
[29:14] said in that private interview because
[29:16] you're going to hear what he says he'll
[29:17] say I just had that on a private
[29:19] interview a little bit ago a Godly
[29:21] little sister had this question and he's
[29:23] going to talk to the congregation about
[29:25] it and it's really nice to know who that
[29:27] is and what he said to her in the
[29:29] private interview and it makes it gives
[29:31] you so much uh more depth of
[29:34] understanding when you hear him say it
[29:35] so he's going to reference it right here
[29:36] in the beginning as he's greeting the
[29:38] people and talking to the people and so
[29:40] that's who he's referring to Sister
[29:42] Bruce it's the it's the private
[29:44] interview that we have on tape and that
[29:46] was her question she needed to be healed
[29:48] but her her main question was that she
[29:51] had never had uh an experience of being
[29:54] baptized in the Holy Ghost that she
[29:55] could put her foot on and brother
[29:56] brandom helped her find the one she
[29:58] could put her foot on Amen praise
[30:02] God all right uh let's all stand
[30:05] together and let's read the scripture
[30:07] that brother Bam's going to open with in
[30:09] Isaiah 53 I like to do this because as
[30:11] we're going through our book and have
[30:13] our Books open and our pens and all of
[30:15] these things taking notes sometimes it's
[30:17] hard to flip open your Bible and the
[30:19] text is in the uh Masterpiece book but
[30:23] I'd like for us to see it in our Bibles
[30:25] as we begin so Isaiah 53
[30:27] and this is Brother benham's this is the
[30:29] scripture he's going to open with and
[30:31] use for the uh
[30:33] context Isaiah chap 53 verse
[30:38] 1 who hath believed our report and to
[30:41] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[30:44] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[30:46] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[30:48] ha no form nor comeliness and when we
[30:51] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[30:53] should desire him he is despised and
[30:56] rejected of men a man of sorrow and
[30:58] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[31:00] were our faces from him he was despised
[31:03] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[31:05] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[31:07] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[31:10] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[31:12] for our transgressions he was bruised
[31:14] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[31:16] our peace was upon him and with his
[31:18] stripes we are healed all we like sheep
[31:21] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[31:23] to his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[31:26] him the iniquity of us all he was
[31:28] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[31:30] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[31:33] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[31:34] before her shears is dumb so he openeth
[31:37] not his mouth he was taken from the
[31:39] prison and from judgment and who shall
[31:41] declare his generation for he was cut
[31:43] off out of the land of the living for
[31:45] the transgression of my people was he
[31:48] stricken and he made his grave with the
[31:50] wicked and with the rich in death in his
[31:53] death because he had done no violence
[31:54] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[31:57] it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath
[32:00] put Heath put him to grief when thou
[32:02] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[32:04] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[32:06] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[32:08] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[32:11] of the travail of his soul and shall be
[32:13] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[32:15] righteous servant justify many for he
[32:17] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[32:20] will I divide him a portion with the
[32:21] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[32:23] the strong because Heath poured out his
[32:26] soul unto death and he has number and he
[32:28] was numbered with the transgressors and
[32:30] he Beed the sins of many and made
[32:33] intercession for the
[32:35] transgressors what an opening scripture
[32:38] for the Masterpiece a work of art God
[32:41] bless you as you take your seats Amen
[32:44] brother Franco if you can bring up the
[32:47] Masterpiece we'll begin on page
[32:50] one paragraph
[32:56] 1
[32:59] let's bow our heads now for
[33:01] prayer while our heads and hearts are
[33:04] bowed before God I I wonder how many in
[33:07] here has a request that they'd like God
[33:10] to remember but just lifting up your
[33:13] hand now hold your request in your heart
[33:15] now as we pray Lord Jesus th the the
[33:20] fountain an exhaustible Fountain of Life
[33:24] flow through us today Lord and cleanse
[33:27] us from all
[33:29] unbelief all sin that we might stand in
[33:33] thy presence now Hallelujah knowing that
[33:36] there is need Among Us that we know that
[33:39] we are sinners and not not worthy of any
[33:42] blessing but then when we think of him
[33:46] who came and took our sins then when his
[33:49] blood's there it's not it's not us in
[33:52] the presence of God it's him just our
[33:56] Voice through his blood is blood
[33:58] speaking oh God then cleanse our hearts
[34:01] from sin and
[34:03] unbelief give to us the desires of our
[34:06] heart or we truly have these desires to
[34:10] serve you and in these weakening
[34:12] conditions and afflictions and things of
[34:15] the world that's put up on us sometime
[34:17] to perfect us we've been told that that
[34:20] he said think it not strange that these
[34:22] trials come they're only working out for
[34:26] our good and to perfect us and bring us
[34:29] into that place these great deserts of
[34:31] experience or a righteous man are molded
[34:34] into Saints yes we we thank thee for
[34:37] these experiences Lord we would no mean
[34:40] no wise want to uh do anything contrary
[34:44] to your will but we pray father that in
[34:46] this we be brought closer to you and
[34:49] when the burdens are so heavy we can't
[34:51] go no farther than we raise our hands
[34:53] and scream to our father then hear from
[34:55] Heaven Lord heal us make us well for the
[34:59] kingdom of God's sake bless Thy word
[35:02] this morning Lord Thy word is the truth
[35:05] we've assembled here now in the church
[35:08] we pray for brother Neville and for
[35:09] brother caps and brother Collins and all
[35:11] the rest of the ministers and the and
[35:14] the trustees deacons and all the leoty
[35:16] and the strangers in our gates oh God
[35:19] may this be a day that we long remember
[35:22] because of your presence we're here
[35:24] under great expectation this morning
[35:26] Lord just momentarily notice called
[35:29] together we feel that it's for our
[35:31] purpose may your purpose be achieved
[35:34] Lord for we ask it in Jesus name as we
[35:37] submit ourselves amen glory to
[35:41] God it's Grand to be here and to uh be
[35:46] assembled with this church full of
[35:48] people I wasn't expecting to be hardly
[35:51] anyone here this morning because I
[35:53] didn't hardly know myself I was going to
[35:55] be here we just got in from
[35:58] Philadelphia and
[36:01] so I come in thinking I was going to
[36:04] have to go to Arizona right quick for
[36:08] have a funeral service for a friend of
[36:10] mine uh a uh Captain Jim Mosley a very
[36:15] precious Godly boy led to Christ not
[36:17] long ago three Mosley brothers and um
[36:21] one of them fell was in the plane the
[36:24] other day and was killed instantly lady
[36:26] to fire for 10 hours before they got to
[36:28] him so Lee is 28 years old his wife 26
[36:33] and and leave three little children the
[36:36] oldest seven very sad and uh they when
[36:40] they got him in then they had to bring
[36:41] him the next day so I just I didn't get
[36:43] to go and I just wrote out or sent a
[36:46] telegram what I was going to say what I
[36:48] would have said at brother Mosley's
[36:50] funeral and some these things we can't
[36:53] understand but yet uh he makes
[36:55] everything work just right
[36:57] right we are here in service of the Lord
[37:01] this morning knowing that that that we
[37:04] believe God that we believe that he'll
[37:06] make everything just exactly right
[37:08] regardless of what it is and how it
[37:10] works out we know it's got to work for
[37:12] good he promise that it's just got to be
[37:14] that
[37:15] way sometimes we can't understand that
[37:18] gets very complicated at times but yet
[37:21] we know it is the truth because the
[37:24] Bible says it's a truth and the Bible to
[37:27] us is God and letter form amen now we
[37:31] got to place our faith
[37:32] somewhere and if if I or any of us in
[37:37] life tried to make a success in life and
[37:41] become many times a
[37:44] multi-millionaire but what do we going
[37:46] to do with that we got to come down at
[37:48] the end of the road and what what good
[37:50] is it to us thing and money is a a
[37:55] script it's an exchange
[37:57] but you can't exchange it for life only
[38:00] God has life so we we realize that we're
[38:03] here in a netive
[38:05] form and as long as there is a negative
[38:08] there has to be a positive there cannot
[38:11] be a negative without a positive see
[38:15] because it's because of the positive
[38:18] that makes the negative like you had a
[38:20] negative picture of some object there
[38:23] has to be an object somewhere or it to
[38:25] strike the Light Strike that lens or
[38:28] there wouldn't be any any negative so
[38:30] when we see that our life here is in the
[38:33] negative and knowing that we're in the
[38:35] image of some life
[38:38] somewhere then we know that there is a
[38:40] positive somewhere that the light has
[38:43] struck and it's reflected something here
[38:46] on Earth and we are only that
[38:49] reflection the genuine object is
[38:54] somewhere if that isn't
[38:57] I'm the worst deceived man in the world
[38:59] I spent my life in vain but I know
[39:03] beyond a shadow of doubt that it's there
[39:07] that's why we're
[39:08] here when I see you people come across
[39:10] the country on a few moments noce and
[39:13] sometime presuming then it makes me feel
[39:15] real little when I come into a meeting
[39:18] like this to think that I know people
[39:19] here travel for hundreds of miles just
[39:21] to be here for a few minutes of service
[39:24] just to set here some woman just made a
[39:28] remark come in the other day and said
[39:31] show me where the man is walking let me
[39:33] walk behind
[39:34] him upon the
[39:36] ground so I'll get
[39:38] well now if people believes you like
[39:41] that and you're representative of Christ
[39:43] then what should we do we should be very
[39:45] careful because you're not only
[39:47] destroying yourself as wrong you're
[39:49] destroying others who are following
[39:51] you so I know no denomination or nothing
[39:54] to take you to the only one thing I had
[39:56] my my faith and if you believe me follow
[39:58] what I tell you because I believe the
[40:01] Bible That's the word of godall other
[40:04] things fail
[40:05] glory amen um he is life he is the word
[40:12] now I know that you when I come here I
[40:16] keep you long I prayed to God when I
[40:19] felt like I want to come here today I've
[40:22] had so many interviews and calls and so
[40:24] forth I had to meet some of them this
[40:25] morning and I said 'w brother Neville no
[40:28] doubt asked me to speak and that was
[40:30] Friday and I said brother Neville will
[40:32] probably ask me to speak and when I do
[40:35] then I pray God so hot been so hot and
[40:38] he was good to send us the rain and
[40:40] break the real extreme heat give us a
[40:43] good morning this morning I pray that
[40:45] his goodness will shower each one of you
[40:47] all that you'll ever remember being here
[40:50] this morning may his grace and blessings
[40:53] be upon you let not to visit a friend
[40:56] sick brother Bill da I don't see him
[40:58] here this morning somehow oh here he is
[41:01] he's yeah I thinking an old man of 901
[41:05] years old and still storing across the
[41:08] the country through the deserts and over
[41:09] the snowy mountains and slick
[41:11] roads you don't have to do that God has
[41:15] been good to him you don't have to do
[41:18] that he could sit home and have servant
[41:20] of fan if he wanted to but something
[41:23] happened to build out he was born again
[41:27] and when it was something come into his
[41:29] heart that all he lives for is to attend
[41:33] these services and then if I'm to be the
[41:36] mouthpiece of God would I deceive a
[41:39] friend I'd rather die and let me tell
[41:42] him exactly what's the truth out of this
[41:44] Bible then that's God's word I'm just
[41:46] repeating what he said now I want to
[41:50] read some out of the
[41:52] Bible before we U read I i' like to to
[41:57] say that I believe tonight is a
[41:59] communion
[42:00] night and uh you who are here locally of
[42:05] course the other people will probably be
[42:06] going back to their homes CU they have
[42:08] to go to work you who are locally here
[42:09] in the assembly remember the brother
[42:12] will be giv communion tonight
[42:15] now I'm waiting for a a the final call
[42:19] for
[42:20] Africa uh they would won't let me in as
[42:23] a
[42:24] missionary so the only way I can go in
[42:27] uh down I'm going to Kenya Uganda and
[42:31] tanzan and the only way I can go in
[42:34] first the churches won't let you in cuz
[42:37] they want me to preach something on this
[42:38] side and that side down in Africa I
[42:41] won't go in like that I wouldn't be
[42:42] hypocrite enough to do that so I either
[42:45] tell no sir I'll just preach just what
[42:47] God puts on my heart and that's all see
[42:49] and I'm sure it won't be what they're
[42:51] trying to get me to teach so uh Triune
[42:54] baptisms and so forth like that and
[42:56] fussing with him no but I've been asked
[42:59] to a big convention by Brother Bose just
[43:03] on the verge of coming to seeing some
[43:06] daylight of what we believe and so uh
[43:10] I've asked to come in like I was going
[43:12] on a hunting trip if they let me in like
[43:15] going in hunting if I get somebody say
[43:17] they take me hunting then when I get in
[43:19] there the doctor the
[43:22] doctor's there at the ambassy is a
[43:24] personal friend of mine out of Chicago
[43:27] and as soon as I get in there he say
[43:28] well here's brother Ren over here let's
[43:30] have a meeting so I there the ambassy
[43:32] can't turn me down if a so they're
[43:35] trying to work it through now so I trust
[43:38] that it if it's God's will it'll work
[43:40] out that way see if it's just committed
[43:42] to him if not then I'll notify you I
[43:45] want if it be the will of God then I
[43:47] want to speak on the seven trumpets and
[43:49] that'll be about an 8 day service and we
[43:52] won't be here at the Tabernacle perhaps
[43:54] we try to get an auditorium here I never
[43:56] thought of this new Auditorium just
[43:58] being built up here it's exactly where I
[44:01] saw Jesus the first time in Vision out
[44:03] it's aor built right over the same spot
[44:06] I went right there to the day to L when
[44:07] I looked and see him looking towards the
[44:09] east you remember hearing me tell it
[44:11] when I was out there praying for my
[44:12] father um a little boy it's a boy
[44:15] preacher that's where I saw him stepped
[44:17] looking at him he had his head turned
[44:19] sideways from me I kept walking around
[44:20] clearing my throat in a broom Sage field
[44:23] I kept watching and he never turn I
[44:25] called his name Jesus and he turned
[44:26] around held his arms out and that's all
[44:28] I remembered until daylight and so I
[44:31] come back out of the field on towards
[44:33] daylight so maybe the Lord let me preach
[44:36] those trumpets there wherever it is
[44:39] God's will be done turn in your Bibles
[44:42] now uh to Isaiah the 50 um 53rd chapter
[44:48] of
[44:50] Isaiah now we trust that God will bless
[44:53] our feeble efforts of coming together
[44:56] this morning we just come down from
[44:59] Philadelphia where is at the Full Gospel
[45:02] businessman's
[45:04] convention and um listening to their

[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] we
[45:57] how we stand in honor of God's
[46:00] word as I read Isaiah the 53rd chapter
[46:04] who has believed our report and to whom
[46:07] is the arm of the Lord
[46:11] revealed notice it's a question to begin
[46:14] with for he shall grow up before him as
[46:19] a tender plant and has a root out of dry
[46:22] ground he has no Farm nor commonness and
[46:25] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[46:29] that we should desire him he is despised
[46:33] and rejected of man a man of sorrow
[46:38] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[46:41] were our faces from him he was
[46:45] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[46:49] he has borne our grief and has carried
[46:52] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[46:56] stricken smitten of God and Afflicted
[47:00] but he was wounded for our
[47:04] transgressions he was bruised for our
[47:07] iniquities the Chast of our peace was
[47:10] upon him and with his stripes we were
[47:13] healed all we like sheep have gone
[47:16] astray we've turned everyone to his own
[47:19] way and the lord has laid upon him the
[47:24] iniquity of us all he was
[47:28] oppressed and was afflicted yet he
[47:31] opened not his mouth he was brought as a
[47:35] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[47:39] before her shears dumb so he opened not
[47:42] his mouth he was taken from prison and
[47:45] from judgment and who shall declare his
[47:49] generation for he was cut off out of the
[47:52] land of the living for the
[47:54] transgressions of my people he was
[47:57] stricken and he made his grave with the
[48:01] wicked and with the rich in his death
[48:04] because he has done no violence neither
[48:07] was there deceit in his mouth yet it
[48:09] pleased the Lord to bruise
[48:12] him he put him to grief when thou shalt
[48:17] make his soul an offering for sin he
[48:20] shall seiz seed and he shall prolong his
[48:23] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[48:26] prosper in his hand and he shall see of
[48:30] the travail of his soul and shall be
[48:34] satisfied by his knowledge shall many
[48:37] righteous servants be justified many for
[48:41] he shall bear their iniquity therefore I
[48:45] will divide him a portion with the great
[48:49] and shall divide the spars with the
[48:51] strong because he has poured out his
[48:54] soul unto to death and was numbered with
[48:57] the transgressors and he bear the sins
[49:02] of many and made intercessions for the
[49:06] transgressors father
[49:09] God Thy word is a
[49:12] lamp uh the light that lights the path
[49:15] of every
[49:17] believer into the presence of God as it
[49:20] carries us like a lantern in our hand
[49:23] You' have not provided enough that we
[49:25] should see the end from the beginning
[49:28] and but walk with faith but as a man
[49:31] would travel through a dark forest at
[49:33] night and that's where we are the light
[49:36] that he holds only provides step by step
[49:41] but the path though leading
[49:43] upward just walk with the light and may
[49:48] the light shine today upon the word to
[49:50] lead us one step further to the kingdom
[49:54] of God for we ask it in Jesus name
[50:03] amen the subject that I feel to speak to
[50:07] the congregation today is the
[50:13] Masterpiece it may seem rather strange
[50:16] to take a a scripture reading like this
[50:19] of a of one of the most
[50:23] bruised and
[50:26] mous of pictures of the
[50:29] Bible that when the Bible says that this
[50:34] perfect
[50:35] servant that was afflicted and bruised
[50:38] and
[50:40] torn and yet take a text from that as
[50:44] Masterpiece very
[50:46] strange but I'm my mind is thinking this
[50:49] morning
[50:51] as uh we journey back I do for a few
[50:54] years I was in invited up to far
[50:58] Sal and and California above Los
[51:02] Angeles my first purpose for going up
[51:05] there was to visit the the grave of of
[51:10] Amy simple mcferson the founder of the
[51:13] four square
[51:15] movement and I went to her her
[51:19] tomb and uh although I I differ with the
[51:22] woman as a minister but yet I in my
[51:25] heart I give admiration and respect for
[51:30] for what she stood for and the the hour
[51:32] and the persecution things she had to go
[51:34] through with and um in time of her being
[51:39] here on the earth and then for her her
[51:41] beloved Son which is a bosom friend of
[51:44] mine Roth
[51:46] mcferson and a group of ministers we
[51:48] went up there and they we didn't have
[51:51] time to go in uh to the uh into the the
[51:55] the place where they have the cremation
[51:58] and put the the bodies in a a little box
[52:01] on the side of the wall and in there
[52:04] they have some outstanding uh things
[52:06] such as the last supper and it's lighted
[52:10] by the actual light of the Sun and they
[52:14] have a shutter that it gives them when
[52:16] they go in it's light and then as as
[52:18] they begin to speak it darkens up and
[52:20] after a while it all becomes dark and
[52:24] then the people go out and they have all
[52:27] the supper and the woman that helped the
[52:31] secret of how to beat this glass into
[52:33] this place while I make these pictures
[52:36] while they come to a family for many
[52:39] years back and the art was just give to
[52:42] the children and the last one was a
[52:44] woman and there was uh fixing this
[52:47] picture and uh when you went to mold and
[52:51] burn the the glass BAC it of Judas iscar
[52:55] it busted so then they tried it again
[52:58] and it busted again and she said maybe
[53:01] our Lord doesn't want his enemy picture
[53:04] by his side and said if it burst again
[53:07] we'll not complete the picture but it
[53:10] help that time then of course that was a
[53:13] striking thing in how that such things
[53:15] would happen but then one of the main
[53:18] things that interest me in forlon was
[53:23] Michelangelo's uh the great sculpture
[53:27] the the Monument of
[53:31] Moses it's a A reproduction there of
[53:34] course it isn't the original but it was
[53:36] such a a Great
[53:39] Masterpiece and as I stood and looked at
[53:41] I I like that something it looks like
[53:44] it's represents got something to it I
[53:47] like art real well I believe God is in
[53:50] art I believe God is in music I believe
[53:54] God is in
[53:55] nature God's everywhere and anything
[53:58] that's contrary to the original is a
[54:03] perversion God is in dancing not the
[54:06] kind of dancing you do here but when the
[54:09] Sons and Daughters of God are in the
[54:11] spirit of God and that's dancing but uh
[54:15] like I had to contend with at 2:00 this
[54:17] morning up there in the lane uh that's
[54:20] the perversion of it but this
[54:23] masterpiece that
[54:25] Michelangelo had had made it uh it cost
[54:30] him something to do that that he was a
[54:32] great man and it cost a big part of his
[54:35] life because he was many many years and
[54:40] carving out just take a rock and a
[54:43] Marvel and keep carving it and to see
[54:45] only the man the sculpture himself has
[54:49] in his mind what he's trying to do he
[54:52] he's the one you might walk up and say
[54:55] to him what are you pecking on that rock
[54:57] for to The Outsider who doesn't know
[55:00] what's in his heart uh it's
[55:03] nonsense but the the man the sculpture
[55:06] himself he he's got a A Vision in his
[55:09] mind what he's trying to make and he's
[55:12] trying to reproduce what he has on his
[55:15] mind in the form of a of a monument
[55:21] that's reason he's digging it out all
[55:23] the rocks and this to do you have to
[55:25] start off right at the
[55:27] beginning and you have to follow the
[55:30] pattern see you can't get a little piece
[55:33] start off we'll make it this way no I
[55:36] believe no he's got to have a exact
[55:39] pattern and in his mind he's got that
[55:42] pattern and he cannot vary from that
[55:45] pattern now in order to do this he had
[55:48] to draw in his mind because we have no
[55:51] real pictures of
[55:53] Moses but he had to get a mental picture
[55:56] in his mind of exactly what Moses was
[56:01] now a genuine sculpture is inspired like
[56:03] a genuine poet or any genuine singer
[56:07] musician whatever it might be all real
[56:10] has to come by
[56:12] inspiration Michelangelo must have had
[56:15] the inspiration of what Moses really
[56:18] looked like and he caught it in his mind
[56:21] what Moses must have been so he set
[56:23] forth on this great piece of marble The
[56:28] Cutting to the pattern and bringing down
[56:31] and honing down uh to he got to the real
[56:34] picture of what uh uh it must have been
[56:38] in his mind and then when he got all so
[56:43] perfect every corner off and every place
[56:46] rubbed and the eyes just right every
[56:49] hair and beard all just the way it was
[56:54] you he stood off and looked at it I I
[56:56] think of of many many hard years of
[57:00] Labor and how he had to hold that same
[57:04] vision all the time in his mind of what
[57:07] he was going to
[57:08] do and this think that Vision on his
[57:11] mind for so many
[57:13] years to make it look just exactly to
[57:17] what it was he caught the vision first
[57:20] and how he had to work to that Vision
[57:22] cutting off and making down and when he
[57:25] got it to where he perfected it till it
[57:29] really got
[57:31] perfect he stood and looked at it when
[57:33] he finished up that morning with a
[57:35] hammer in his hand and he was so
[57:39] inspired when he looked at it because
[57:43] the vision of his mind was standing
[57:46] before him in
[57:48] reality what he had
[57:51] seen and his conception of What mo Moses
[57:55] was there was figured before him what he
[58:00] had in his heart all these years and
[58:03] toils and hours of sorrow and distress
[58:07] and critics and everything else but yet
[58:10] he stayed right with the vision until it
[58:12] was
[58:14] completed and then when it was completed
[58:17] he stood back with the hammer sculptures
[58:20] hammer in his hand and he looked at that
[58:23] monument and the inspiration of the
[58:25] vision that he had seen of how to do it
[58:27] inspired him so much till he the
[58:29] inspiration struck him till he got
[58:31] beside himself and struck it across the
[58:33] knee and said
[58:37] speak now there's a flaw on that great
[58:42] image on the knee on the right knee just
[58:47] above the knee about 6 in is a place I
[58:50] put my hand on it about that
[58:53] deep after he had spent all that time
[58:58] for years and years to make this then
[59:02] under the the
[59:04] influence of seeing
[59:07] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[59:11] in his vision and desire to see it was
[59:16] completed and when it was completed he
[59:19] was so inspired by it till he thought
[59:21] his own Masterpiece just speak back to
[59:25] and he struck it across the leg and
[59:29] speak and it made a flaw on
[59:32] it it put a flaw on the image to me the
[59:37] flaw was what made it the
[59:41] Masterpiece now maybe to the the mind
[59:44] that might think different you think
[59:47] that spoiled it no to me it it made it
[59:52] what it was it it it because after so
[59:56] many years of careful work and TOs and
[1:00:00] inspiration and so forth of making it
[1:00:04] his Torah had proved not in vain it was
[1:00:07] perfect and that's why he cried out
[1:00:12] speak because he' seen before him that
[1:00:15] he was been able to achieve to bring to
[1:00:19] pass the vision that was in his mind and
[1:00:22] therefore under inspiration he done
[1:00:24] something out of the
[1:00:26] reason out of the ordinary he struck it
[1:00:29] and holled
[1:00:31] speak see he wouldn't have done that if
[1:00:35] he have
[1:00:36] thought but he didn't think it was
[1:00:40] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[1:00:42] mind setting there perfectly before him
[1:00:45] his toils and wearies and long nights
[1:00:49] and housed away from the world for days
[1:00:52] and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it
[1:00:55] and get back and oh that's just not the
[1:00:57] way it was I just got to come down to
[1:00:59] this and rub it and then when he saw it
[1:01:01] just
[1:01:02] perfect then he saw in
[1:01:06] reality the
[1:01:08] negative of the what was in his mind had
[1:01:12] become
[1:01:14] real it become
[1:01:17] positive therefore it sprung into him it
[1:01:21] was so real that he must cry out speak
[1:01:26] to me it was a
[1:01:28] reflection it was it was a compliment to
[1:01:32] his work that his own work so inspired
[1:01:36] him that he would be beside himself to
[1:01:39] Smite it and say
[1:01:42] speak I stood there and looked at the
[1:01:44] monument I thought of the hours that the
[1:01:47] man must have put and making that they
[1:01:50] said how many years it was but it it was
[1:01:55] a reflection to him because it was a
[1:01:58] contribution to his uh uh to his great
[1:02:02] art his great work of what he was
[1:02:05] doing and when he finally was able to
[1:02:08] achieve it it was so great now let us
[1:02:12] turn the page of Michelangelo and close
[1:02:16] the
[1:02:17] book let's open another
[1:02:22] book and read of the great
[1:02:27] sculpture the
[1:02:31] almighty who before there was a
[1:02:35] world and before the foundations was
[1:02:40] laid he had in his
[1:02:44] mind what he
[1:02:47] wanted and he wanted to make man in his
[1:02:51] own
[1:02:52] image he wanted to make something and
[1:02:56] and reality of what was a vision to him
[1:03:00] what was in his
[1:03:02] thinking now to Michelangelo that was an
[1:03:05] attribute of his
[1:03:07] thought and God wanted to make a man
[1:03:11] after his image the great
[1:03:15] sculpture and he went to work on
[1:03:18] him and we notice as he brought up from
[1:03:21] the materials the first perhaps this
[1:03:24] fishes and then the birds and and then
[1:03:27] the creeping things upon the Earth and
[1:03:29] and many things that he brought but
[1:03:33] finally as he brewed being
[1:03:37] Creator he had he was like a man now a
[1:03:40] sculpture that has to take something
[1:03:42] that's been created a human an image he
[1:03:44] was the
[1:03:46] sculpture of Eternal things he was a
[1:03:51] sculpture that could create and bring
[1:03:54] into
[1:03:56] existence that which he has in his mind
[1:04:00] to do or otherwise he can make material
[1:04:04] what his attributes
[1:04:07] desired and as he begin to work upon uh
[1:04:11] creeping things like upon the the the
[1:04:16] little animals upon the
[1:04:18] Earth and then he began to bring it from
[1:04:21] that into something else higher
[1:04:25] then finally he brought it into the
[1:04:27] larger animals such as the lion tiger
[1:04:30] bear then he brought it into the the the
[1:04:34] life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so
[1:04:37] forth now not an
[1:04:39] evolution as we think that one came from
[1:04:42] the e that was a complete
[1:04:45] creation God working in a
[1:04:48] pattern but finally there came forth
[1:04:52] upon the earth a
[1:04:56] Perfection and that was a
[1:04:59] man and then he could see in that man
[1:05:03] that it looked like
[1:05:07] him so now when he looked upon him he
[1:05:11] was a reflection of what his creator
[1:05:14] was God had now been able to achieve the
[1:05:19] thing that he wanted a man in his own in
[1:05:25] and then I might say to this that uh
[1:05:30] when he made this man there was
[1:05:32] something about him yet that didn't look
[1:05:35] just
[1:05:38] right because that he he was by
[1:05:42] himself and that's how God had been by
[1:05:46] himself he was uh the
[1:05:50] Eternal and the man now in the image of
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:54] also existed on the Earth by himself so
[1:05:58] he must have struck a little blow over
[1:06:01] on his left
[1:06:04] side and from there he took that piece
[1:06:07] that struck off of it and made him a
[1:06:11] helpmate a
[1:06:13] wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh
[1:06:18] he was he had somebody with
[1:06:21] him and uh that's his great work any is
[1:06:26] any great sculpture would take his uh
[1:06:29] his his
[1:06:31] Masterpiece now first he had a
[1:06:34] masterpiece of himself but now he seen
[1:06:38] that the Masterpiece was lome like he
[1:06:40] was so he divided the Masterpiece by
[1:06:44] striking it in the side and brought
[1:06:46] forth a
[1:06:48] helpmate and now to make the two
[1:06:52] one he put them like any great sculpture
[1:06:55] in a place that it's
[1:06:57] beautiful a a sculpture wouldn't make a
[1:07:00] Great Masterpiece and then take it and
[1:07:02] set it in an alley somewhere or hide it
[1:07:05] behind
[1:07:06] buildings as our Lord told us a man
[1:07:09] doesn't lie at a canle and put it under
[1:07:11] a
[1:07:12] bushel when we become God's masterpieces
[1:07:15] we're not hid in an alley somewhere we
[1:07:17] we must give life so we see that that he
[1:07:22] actually made this master piece he
[1:07:25] placed it up here on the earth and put
[1:07:28] it in the most beautiful place there was
[1:07:32] in the Garden of
[1:07:34] Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two
[1:07:38] being
[1:07:39] one in the Garden of Eden how it must
[1:07:43] have pleased him that he saw this
[1:07:46] masterpiece was well he after that we
[1:07:49] find out that he
[1:07:51] rested he was so well pleased with his
[1:07:55] work I
[1:07:57] remember that my opinion the Masterpiece
[1:08:00] is the
[1:08:02] stroke that marged St Angelo's uh Moses
[1:08:07] Masterpiece in the monument and it was a
[1:08:10] stroke that cut the side of his
[1:08:13] Masterpiece that brought out the
[1:08:16] bride and now we see them as a
[1:08:20] masterpiece
[1:08:22] family of in the Garden of
[1:08:26] Eden how beautiful it was and it so
[1:08:28] pleased him till he he took rest then he
[1:08:31] said I I'll
[1:08:32] rest but while he was
[1:08:37] resting and trusting to his
[1:08:41] Masterpiece his
[1:08:43] enemy uh come in and found this Great
[1:08:49] Masterpiece and he by deceit he he
[1:08:52] crawls under the the garden walls and
[1:08:56] then uh he he mared this beautiful uh
[1:09:01] Masterpiece he he admired it so that it
[1:09:05] it fell now I'm trying to watch that
[1:09:09] clock and I ask Mike my nephew to ring
[1:09:12] that Bell in 30 minutes but uh uh he's
[1:09:15] not done it and I've already been 30
[1:09:17] minutes but lord it's uh we uh continue
[1:09:21] on a little bit now
[1:09:24] I don't want to to break these rules I I
[1:09:27] made these rules see and I I and here's
[1:09:30] breaking your own
[1:09:32] Rule now notice then this masterpiece
[1:09:37] when Satan got a hold of the deceiver
[1:09:40] broke through the walls and uh and he
[1:09:44] mired this
[1:09:47] masterpiece uh because that the way he
[1:09:50] did it why how did he do it I'll go more
[1:09:54] detail of it how he done it was this
[1:09:57] masterpiece was
[1:09:59] walled by the
[1:10:03] word God's
[1:10:06] word and the Masterpiece itself of the
[1:10:10] family was fortified by this word but
[1:10:14] the broken part that was broke off of
[1:10:18] the original went out beyond that
[1:10:22] wall and give Satan a
[1:10:25] chance to
[1:10:28] Mar and now as you know what I believe
[1:10:31] on those things so I won't have to say
[1:10:35] that but the Masterpiece was
[1:10:38] broke but the great
[1:10:42] sculpture when he seen the fall of his
[1:10:47] family the
[1:10:49] Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to
[1:10:51] leave it lay there face down
[1:10:56] and ruin he went to work immediately to
[1:11:01] build it up
[1:11:02] again he wasn't willing that it should
[1:11:05] perish lay there like that all the time
[1:11:07] because he's God and he will not be
[1:11:10] defeated so he went to work immediately
[1:11:14] and began to build
[1:11:16] again unto his own image a
[1:11:22] man
[1:11:25] amen praise
[1:11:26] God see I told you we're just starting
[1:11:29] to get into the meat of it and we have
[1:11:30] to stop for tonight but but uh it'll set
[1:11:34] a good foundation for next time and next
[1:11:36] time we'll launch into the deep amen
[1:11:38] when we get we're go into these
[1:11:40] questions now um we'll get started on
[1:11:44] that uh and I want to apologize the part
[1:11:46] where he refers to the interview with
[1:11:48] sister uh Bruce comes next time sorry I
[1:11:51] thought it was in this time but it'll be
[1:11:52] next time so maybe I'll remind you of
[1:11:54] that again next time all right the first
[1:11:58] question that we had was why did
[1:11:59] Michelangelo where where did
[1:12:01] Michelangelo get the image of Moses so
[1:12:05] let's turn to um and look at paragraph
[1:12:09] 33 which will be at the bottom of page
[1:12:12] seven bottom of page seven paragraph
[1:12:19] 33 says but this and the Masterpiece
[1:12:22] that Michelangelo had made it cost him
[1:12:24] something to do that he was a great man
[1:12:26] and it cost a big part of his life
[1:12:27] because he was many many years carving
[1:12:29] out just take a rock and of marble and
[1:12:32] keep carving it and see that only the
[1:12:34] man the sculptor himself has in his mind
[1:12:36] what he's trying to do and he's the one
[1:12:38] you might walk up to say to him what are
[1:12:39] you pecking on that rock for to The
[1:12:41] Outsider he doesn't know what's in his
[1:12:43] heart it's nonsense but to the man the
[1:12:45] sculptor himself he's got a vision in
[1:12:47] his mind that he's trying to make and
[1:12:50] he's trying to reproduce what he has on
[1:12:52] his mind and in the form of a monument
[1:12:55] that's the reason he's digging out of
[1:12:56] that
[1:12:57] rock and let's read on a little further
[1:12:59] and this to do you have to start off
[1:13:01] right at the beginning and you have to
[1:13:03] follow the pattern you can't get a
[1:13:04] little piece to start off and we'll make
[1:13:06] it this way no I believe no he's got to
[1:13:09] have an exact pattern and in his mind
[1:13:11] he's got the pattern and he cannot vary
[1:13:13] from that pattern now in order to do
[1:13:15] this he had to draw in his mind because
[1:13:17] we have no real pictures of Moses but he
[1:13:20] had to get the mental picture in his
[1:13:21] mind of exactly what Moses was now a
[1:13:24] genuine sculptor is inspired like a
[1:13:27] genuine poet or any genuine singer
[1:13:29] musician whatever it might be all real
[1:13:32] has to come by inspiration Michelangelo
[1:13:34] must have had the inspiration of what
[1:13:36] Moses really looked like and he caught
[1:13:38] it in his mind what Moses must have been
[1:13:41] so he set forth in his great piece of
[1:13:43] marble The Cutting to the pattern and
[1:13:44] bringing down and honing down until he
[1:13:47] got to the real picture of what it must
[1:13:49] have been in his mind so now we know
[1:13:51] where did where did Michael Ang get this
[1:13:54] image that he was going to model this
[1:13:56] this sculpture after it came by
[1:13:58] inspiration and it came as an image by
[1:14:00] inspiration in his mind of what Moses
[1:14:02] looked like it's important brother
[1:14:03] Brandon he's trying to show us a type
[1:14:05] he's using this as a type so if we go to
[1:14:07] paragraph 44 at the bottom of page nine
[1:14:11] says now let us turn the page of
[1:14:12] Michelangelo and close the book and
[1:14:14] let's open another book and read of the
[1:14:16] great sculpter the almighty who before
[1:14:19] there was a world and before the
[1:14:20] foundations was laid he had in his mind
[1:14:23] what he wanted and he wanted to make he
[1:14:26] wanted to make man in his own image he
[1:14:28] wanted to make something in reality of
[1:14:30] what was a vision to him what was in his
[1:14:32] thinking so brother renom is just tying
[1:14:34] the two together and he's showing where
[1:14:36] did Michelangelo get the image that he
[1:14:39] was going to make the sculpt the the
[1:14:41] sculpture of Moses he got it from
[1:14:43] inspiration from his own mind where did
[1:14:45] God get the image of the great work he
[1:14:47] was doing it was in his mind so let's
[1:14:50] turn back to the beginning here on uh
[1:14:53] paragraph 33 page 7 bottom of page 7
[1:14:56] there's something he says that I just
[1:14:58] want to reference we'll start right in
[1:15:00] the middle this paragraph where it says
[1:15:02] and see and see only the man the
[1:15:05] sculptor himself has in his mind what
[1:15:07] he's trying to do he is the one you
[1:15:10] might walk up and say to him what are
[1:15:11] you pecking on that rock for to The
[1:15:13] Outsider who doesn't know what's in his
[1:15:15] heart it's nonsense but to the man the
[1:15:17] sculptor himself he's got a vision in
[1:15:19] his mind of what he's trying to
[1:15:22] make amen I love that God already has in
[1:15:26] his mind the image of you and I he knows
[1:15:30] what he's trying to do with his bride he
[1:15:31] knows what he's been doing over seven
[1:15:33] Church ages he knows what it's going to
[1:15:35] look like at the End Amen and and along
[1:15:37] the way it may not be clear and we may
[1:15:39] question why this age and why did this
[1:15:41] happen and why did this go right and why
[1:15:43] did this go wrong through the seven
[1:15:45] Church ages we look at it that way but
[1:15:47] the sculptor has in his mind by
[1:15:48] inspiration by a vision he already knows
[1:15:51] what he's going to produce and every
[1:15:53] every stroke has the one object in mind
[1:15:56] to bring it to this conclusion and the
[1:15:58] same thing in our life God already has a
[1:16:00] design in his mind for the way we're
[1:16:02] going to look at the end of our life's
[1:16:04] journey and we may not understand every
[1:16:06] stroke and sometimes we've asked God
[1:16:08] what why why did you do
[1:16:10] that why the Chisel right there and why
[1:16:13] so deep why did you cut so deep and why
[1:16:15] did you knock such a big chunk
[1:16:18] off but he already has the vision in his
[1:16:21] mind and every stroke every stroke has
[1:16:26] that vision in mind and he's working it
[1:16:28] to one goal and that's so he gets you
[1:16:30] and I in the image he had of us before
[1:16:32] the foundation of the
[1:16:34] world praise God what's so beautiful
[1:16:37] about that is we have trials we have
[1:16:39] tribulations we have difficulties but he
[1:16:41] saw me finished before the foundation of
[1:16:44] the world there's no fear in me not
[1:16:45] finishing because the master the master
[1:16:48] Craftsman the master artist is on the
[1:16:51] job and he knows how hard to strike
[1:16:53] where to strike where to polish when to
[1:16:55] beat and when to
[1:16:57] rub and there's no chance that I won't
[1:17:00] come into that image because he's
[1:17:02] working by
[1:17:04] inspiration praise
[1:17:07] God
[1:17:09] Amen the second question why did he
[1:17:11] strike the sculpture let's go to
[1:17:14] paragraph 36 on page
[1:17:16] 8 page8 let's go to the middle of page8
[1:17:20] in paragraph
[1:17:22] 36
[1:17:24] and then when he got to all it all
[1:17:26] perfect every corner off every place
[1:17:28] rubbed and the eyes just right every
[1:17:29] hair and beard and all just the way it
[1:17:31] was he stood off and looked at it I
[1:17:34] think of many many hard years of Labor
[1:17:35] and how he had to hold that same vision
[1:17:37] all the time in his mind of what he was
[1:17:39] going to do and just think that Vision
[1:17:42] in his mind for so many years to make it
[1:17:44] look just exactly what it was he caught
[1:17:46] the vision first and how he had to work
[1:17:48] to that Vision cutting off and making
[1:17:51] down and when he got to where where the
[1:17:54] where he perfected it till it really got
[1:17:57] perfect he stood and looked at it when
[1:17:59] he finished up there up that morning
[1:18:01] with a hammer in his hand and he was so
[1:18:03] inspired when he looked at it because
[1:18:05] the vision of his mind was standing
[1:18:07] before him in reality what he had seen
[1:18:09] in his conception of what Moses was
[1:18:12] there it was figured before him what he
[1:18:14] had had in his heart all these years and
[1:18:17] the toils and the hours of sorrow and
[1:18:18] distress and critics and everything else
[1:18:21] but he stayed right with the vision
[1:18:23] until it was
[1:18:24] completed and then when it was completed
[1:18:26] he stood back with the hammer the
[1:18:28] sculptor's hammer in his hand and he
[1:18:30] looked at the monument and the
[1:18:31] inspiration of the vision that he had
[1:18:33] seen of how to do it inspired him so
[1:18:35] much till the inspiration struck him
[1:18:38] till he got beside himself and he struck
[1:18:40] it across the knee and he said speak now
[1:18:43] there's a flaw on that great image on
[1:18:44] the knee on the right knee just above
[1:18:46] the knee about 6 Ines is a place I put
[1:18:49] my hand on it about that deep and after
[1:18:52] he had spent all that time for years and
[1:18:53] years to make this then under the
[1:18:55] influence of seeing fulfilled what he
[1:18:57] had seen in his heart and his vision and
[1:18:59] desired to see it was completed when it
[1:19:02] was completed he was so inspired by it
[1:19:04] till he he thought his own Masterpiece
[1:19:06] should speak back to him and he struck
[1:19:08] it across the leg and hollered speak and
[1:19:10] it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on
[1:19:12] the image man why did he strike it he
[1:19:15] struck it because he was so inspired
[1:19:18] that what was in his mind was now in
[1:19:20] reality that he thought that His Image
[1:19:23] should speak back to him amen we know
[1:19:27] God has done the same thing Amen to
[1:19:29] Jesus Christ he was so inspired by
[1:19:31] seeing a man completely in His image and
[1:19:34] the fullness of God that he struck him
[1:19:38] and he struck him for a purpose and
[1:19:39] we'll get to that in
[1:19:41] future question number three what made
[1:19:44] it the Masterpiece to brother
[1:19:48] Brandon let's pick it up right here
[1:19:50] paragraph 40 where we're at to me the
[1:19:53] flaw was what made it the Masterpiece
[1:19:56] now maybe to the mind that might think
[1:19:57] different you think that spoiled it no
[1:20:00] to me it made it what it was because
[1:20:03] after so many years of careful work and
[1:20:05] toils and inspiration and so forth of
[1:20:06] making it his toil had proved not in
[1:20:09] vain it was perfect and that's why he
[1:20:11] cried out speak let's go to paragraph
[1:20:17] 52 paragraph 52 on page
[1:20:21] 11
[1:20:24] now remember that my opinion the
[1:20:26] Masterpiece is the stroke that marred St
[1:20:28] Angelo's Moses Masterpiece in the
[1:20:30] monument it was the stroke that cut the
[1:20:33] side of his Masterpiece that brought out
[1:20:35] the bride and now we see him as a
[1:20:37] masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden
[1:20:39] how beautiful it was and it so pleased
[1:20:41] him till he took rest and he said I'll
[1:20:43] rest so what made it the Masterpiece to
[1:20:46] brother bandam it was the stroke it was
[1:20:48] a man who was so inspired that he would
[1:20:50] strike his own creation and and Christ
[1:20:53] speak and it reminded him of Christ God
[1:20:55] was so pleased with the image so pleased
[1:21:00] with with Christ that he would strike a
[1:21:03] little blow down on his left side and
[1:21:06] now we think when you see a body that's
[1:21:09] so perfect and the resurrected Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ and a
[1:21:13] scar think oh my there's something so
[1:21:17] imperfect no that's what makes it the
[1:21:20] Masterpiece amen when he told Thomas
[1:21:24] Thomas take take thy finger and thrust
[1:21:26] it into my hands and take thy hand and
[1:21:27] thrust it into my side and Thomas said
[1:21:30] oh my Lord and my
[1:21:32] God what was it that's what made it the
[1:21:36] Masterpiece praise
[1:21:39] God uh question number four what was
[1:21:42] wrong with God's first Masterpiece let's
[1:21:46] go to paragraph 45 right here at the
[1:21:49] bottom of page
[1:21:50] nine now to Michel Angelo that was an
[1:21:53] attribute of his
[1:21:54] thought and God wanted to make a man
[1:21:57] after his image the great sculptor and
[1:21:59] he and he went to work on it let's skip
[1:22:01] down to paragraph 47 but finally there
[1:22:04] came forth upon the earth a Perfection
[1:22:06] and that was a man and then he he could
[1:22:09] see in that man that it looked like him
[1:22:11] so now when he looked upon him he was a
[1:22:13] reflection of what his creator was and
[1:22:15] God had now been able to achieve the
[1:22:18] thing that he wanted a man in his own
[1:22:20] image and when I might and I might say
[1:22:23] to say to this that when he had made
[1:22:26] this man there was something about him
[1:22:27] yet that didn't look just right because
[1:22:30] that he was by
[1:22:31] himself that's what was wrong with the
[1:22:33] Masterpiece there was nothing wrong with
[1:22:35] the Masterpiece Adam was
[1:22:37] perfect but to God it didn't look just
[1:22:41] right because that he was by himself and
[1:22:43] that's how God had been by himself he
[1:22:46] was the Eternal and the man now in the
[1:22:48] image of God also existed on the Earth
[1:22:50] by himself so he must have struck a
[1:22:52] little blow over on his left side and
[1:22:54] from there he took the piece that struck
[1:22:56] off of it and made him a help meat a
[1:22:58] wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh
[1:23:01] he he he had somebody with him and
[1:23:04] that's his great
[1:23:06] work and he has any great sculptor would
[1:23:09] take his Masterpiece now first he had a
[1:23:11] masterpiece of himself but now he's seen
[1:23:14] that that Masterpiece was lonesome like
[1:23:16] he was so he divided the Masterpiece by
[1:23:18] striking it in the side and brought
[1:23:20] forth a help meat so what was wrong with
[1:23:24] the Masterpiece the problem was it was
[1:23:26] alone and that wasn't the finished work
[1:23:28] of what God had in his mind there was
[1:23:31] something more cuz remember after God
[1:23:33] United the two together and set them in
[1:23:36] the most perfect setting you could set
[1:23:37] them in the Garden of Eden then he took
[1:23:39] his rest amen and Michelangelo never
[1:23:42] took his rest till he was
[1:23:44] finished and God never took his rest
[1:23:46] because he was the great Al artist The
[1:23:48] Great sculptor and he never finished
[1:23:51] until he would he never rested until he
[1:23:52] was finished and he wasn't finished
[1:23:54] until he brought forth the
[1:23:57] bride now let's look at a couple more
[1:24:00] places here now let's back up to the
[1:24:04] bottom of uh paragraph 48 I want to read
[1:24:07] just the last
[1:24:09] line he was he had somebody with him and
[1:24:13] that's his great work so what's his
[1:24:16] great work is when he struck the man and
[1:24:19] he pulled out of him the woman and
[1:24:20] United them together that's his great
[1:24:23] work now let's go over to paragraph
[1:24:26] 51 I'm going to pick it up in the second
[1:24:28] sentence in paragraph 51 he placed his
[1:24:32] Masterpiece the two being one in the
[1:24:34] Garden of Eden what was his Masterpiece
[1:24:36] the two being
[1:24:38] one all right let's go down to paragraph
[1:24:41] 52 let's go to the second uh part of
[1:24:44] paragraph 52 and it was the stroke that
[1:24:47] cut the side of his Masterpiece that
[1:24:49] brought out the bride and now we see him
[1:24:51] as a Masterpiece family in the Garden of
[1:24:54] Eden What's the Masterpiece a
[1:24:56] masterpiece
[1:24:57] family praise God let's go down to
[1:25:00] paragraph
[1:25:02] 55 I'm going to pick it up in the second
[1:25:05] sentence I'll go I'll go in more detail
[1:25:08] of it how he done it this masterpiece
[1:25:10] was walled by the word God God's word
[1:25:13] and the Masterpiece itself of the family
[1:25:16] was fortified by the word so what's the
[1:25:18] Masterpiece itself the family so now we
[1:25:21] get the Masterpiece the title is the
[1:25:24] Masterpiece not masterpieces am and when
[1:25:28] God took his Great Masterpiece he saw
[1:25:30] that there was something not quite right
[1:25:32] about it because it was by himself like
[1:25:35] God was by himself so he must have
[1:25:37] struck a little blow over on the left
[1:25:38] side and took a piece from that he
[1:25:40] formed the the second part of the
[1:25:42] Masterpiece and United together amen and
[1:25:44] and that was his great work what the two
[1:25:47] being one and where did he put it he put
[1:25:49] it in Eden and when he had completed his
[1:25:51] masterpiece which was a masterpiece
[1:25:53] family then he could take his
[1:25:56] rest praise
[1:25:59] God now let's go down to paragraph
[1:26:03] 56 but the great sculptor when he seen
[1:26:05] the fall of his family the Masterpiece
[1:26:07] he wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[1:26:10] there face down and ruined he went to
[1:26:13] work immediately to build it up again he
[1:26:15] wasn't willing that it should perish lay
[1:26:17] there like that all the time because he
[1:26:19] is God and he will not be defeated so he
[1:26:21] went to work immediately and begin to
[1:26:23] build again unto his own image a man and
[1:26:26] that was Jesus Christ and through the
[1:26:28] Old Testament he built back the man he
[1:26:31] brought back the last Adam which was
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ had
[1:26:35] come and proved that he was a perfect
[1:26:38] Masterpiece there wasn't a flaw in him
[1:26:40] he kept all the word he fully obeyed the
[1:26:43] will of God Amen what did God do he was
[1:26:45] so pleased with him he smoted him so
[1:26:47] that he would speak amen and he took
[1:26:49] from him the the elements necessary to
[1:26:52] to make a bride what's he been doing
[1:26:54] he's rebuilding the Masterpiece family
[1:26:57] he's re rebuilding his great work he's
[1:26:59] rebuilding what had fallen and what had
[1:27:01] fallen was not just a man singular what
[1:27:04] had fallen was the Masterpiece
[1:27:06] family and so now for 4,000 years he
[1:27:10] come to the last Adam but then now for
[1:27:12] the last 2,000 years he's been restoring
[1:27:14] the last part of the Masterpiece which
[1:27:16] is the bride and now in this end time
[1:27:18] he's putting them together in the
[1:27:20] invisible Union of the bride and what's
[1:27:22] he going to do he's going to place them
[1:27:24] again in a beautiful setting and a
[1:27:26] restoration to Eden once more and what
[1:27:29] will he do when he places them there he
[1:27:31] will take his
[1:27:32] rest because his rest was interrupted by
[1:27:35] the fall but he will finish his rest cuz
[1:27:37] God will never be defeated in his
[1:27:41] purposes so what does that make us part
[1:27:44] of the
[1:27:45] Masterpiece not Masterpiece is part of
[1:27:49] the Masterpiece the image God had in in
[1:27:52] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:27:53] world the great work that he's doing to
[1:27:56] display himself on the earth and we find
[1:27:59] ourselves part of that work praise be to
[1:28:04] God I'd like to just if I could just
[1:28:06] point out a few other things that
[1:28:07] weren't questions there some things I
[1:28:08] want to highlight there's so much more
[1:28:11] when we read a message than just just
[1:28:14] Doctrine but there's also the life of
[1:28:16] brother brandham on display and I always
[1:28:17] love to highlight that and I think we're
[1:28:19] so privileged as a people to have the
[1:28:22] life of a prophet on display not just
[1:28:24] the teaching so in the Bible we have the
[1:28:26] teachings of the prophets and we have
[1:28:28] certain aspects of their life and
[1:28:30] certain things that we see but never
[1:28:32] before has the life of a prophet been so
[1:28:34] on display for us to read and so that's
[1:28:37] that's a benefit we have in the message
[1:28:39] so let's go to if you could go with me
[1:28:41] to paragraph 27 at the bottom of page
[1:28:44] six page six paragraph
[1:28:50] 27 I'd like to to read this my mind is
[1:28:54] thinking this morning as we journey back
[1:28:56] I do for a few years I was invited up to
[1:28:58] Forest Lawn in California up above Los
[1:29:01] Angeles my first purpose for going up
[1:29:03] there was to visit the grave of Amy
[1:29:05] simple mcferson the founder the four
[1:29:08] square movement I went to her tomb and
[1:29:10] although I different with the woman as a
[1:29:12] minister but yet in my heart I give
[1:29:14] admiration and respect for what she
[1:29:16] stood for and the hour and the
[1:29:18] persecution and things she had to go
[1:29:20] through with and the time of her being
[1:29:21] here on the
[1:29:22] earth I Marvel at this cuz brother
[1:29:25] brandham does not believe in women
[1:29:28] preachers he teaches out of the Bible
[1:29:30] that it's against the word contrary to
[1:29:33] the word of God it is not the will of
[1:29:35] God it is not the word of God and is
[1:29:39] wrong so was Amy simple mcferson wrong
[1:29:42] for preaching yes she was off the word
[1:29:45] but yet brother bandham so understands
[1:29:47] the church ages and then that portion of
[1:29:49] the word had not come in Clarity she was
[1:29:51] wrong
[1:29:52] but yet he respected her for what she
[1:29:55] stood for and for holding to the truth
[1:29:57] that she knew and doing all she could
[1:29:59] and he could have respect and he went to
[1:30:01] Forest Lawn to honor Amy simple mcferson
[1:30:05] I say praise God if the prophet of God
[1:30:08] can do that I can do that amen I can
[1:30:10] just honor and respect people maybe
[1:30:12] they're off the word maybe they're wrong
[1:30:14] and that's fine maybe they'll never
[1:30:16] understand and they'll never get right
[1:30:18] but I can respect somebody for doing
[1:30:19] whatever they can do and whatever
[1:30:22] portion whatever respect they show and
[1:30:24] whatever they can they can do and give I
[1:30:27] just respect them for that what they're
[1:30:29] blind to they're blind
[1:30:32] to if I can share it with them I'll
[1:30:34] share with them I'll tell them the truth
[1:30:36] but if I can't just thank God that
[1:30:37] there's those who are trying to do
[1:30:39] something right so I just love the
[1:30:42] attitude of the Prophet I think we get a
[1:30:44] whole lot more than just doctorine we
[1:30:45] get life the life of Christ on display
[1:30:49] through our
[1:30:50] brotherr let's go go all the way back to
[1:30:52] the first
[1:30:55] page and look at paragraph three this is
[1:30:57] in brother brenham's prayer and It just
[1:30:59] strikes me I love brother brenham's
[1:31:01] prayers and in paragraph three he says
[1:31:03] give us give to us the desires of our
[1:31:06] heart for we truly have these desires to
[1:31:07] serve you in these weakened conditions
[1:31:10] and afflictions and things of the world
[1:31:12] that's put Upon Us sometimes to perfect
[1:31:15] as we've been told that when he said
[1:31:17] think it not strange that these trials
[1:31:19] come they're only working out for our
[1:31:21] good to perfect us and bring us into the
[1:31:23] that place these great deserts of
[1:31:25] experience where righteous men are
[1:31:27] molded into into Saints we thank thee
[1:31:30] for these experiences Lord we would we
[1:31:33] would no mean no wise want to do
[1:31:35] anything contrary to your will but we
[1:31:37] pray father that in this we'll be
[1:31:39] brought closer to you and when the
[1:31:41] burdens are so heavy we can't go no
[1:31:43] further than we raise our hands and
[1:31:44] scream to our father then hear from
[1:31:46] Heaven Lord Heal us make us well for the
[1:31:49] kingdom of God's sake I just love this
[1:31:52] prayer brother B he he may have been
[1:31:55] going through a tough time himself he
[1:31:56] may have been referring to what others
[1:31:57] were going through in the in the
[1:31:59] interviews but he he's telling us in
[1:32:01] these weakened conditions and
[1:32:03] afflictions and things that have to be
[1:32:05] put on us sometime for our Perfection oh
[1:32:08] God help us in these great deserts of
[1:32:11] experiences where righteous men are
[1:32:12] molded we thank thee for these
[1:32:14] experience he's thanking God for the
[1:32:19] troubles and then he's saying Lord may
[1:32:21] it bring us closer to you and then he
[1:32:23] goes on to say but when it becomes too
[1:32:25] heavy we can't bear it anymore we just
[1:32:27] throw our hands and say father scream to
[1:32:30] our father then you hear from Heaven
[1:32:32] Lord and heal us and make us well I I
[1:32:35] love that prayer that's just the way we
[1:32:37] live isn't it friends that's just the
[1:32:40] reality Thank
[1:32:42] God now let's go to paragraph 11 on the
[1:32:46] next page this is one more point that he
[1:32:49] made that I I really like
[1:32:52] paragraph
[1:32:53] 11 says so we realize that we're here in
[1:32:55] a negative form and as long as there is
[1:32:57] a negative there has to be a
[1:32:59] positive there cannot be a negative
[1:33:02] without a positive because it's because
[1:33:03] of the positive that makes the
[1:33:05] negative amen how many of you believe
[1:33:07] that your life here is a negative
[1:33:10] form emphasis on
[1:33:13] negative but the the negative is only to
[1:33:17] reflect that there's a positive
[1:33:18] somewhere
[1:33:20] else that's what gives us so much
[1:33:22] courage because of the positive that
[1:33:24] makes the negative like you had a
[1:33:26] negative picture of some object there
[1:33:27] had to be an object somewhere or to
[1:33:30] strike the Light Strike the lens or
[1:33:31] there would be there wouldn't be any
[1:33:33] negative so when we see that our life
[1:33:35] here is in the negative and know that
[1:33:37] we're in the image of some life
[1:33:39] somewhere then we know that there is a
[1:33:41] positive somewhere that the light has
[1:33:42] struck and it's reflecting something
[1:33:44] here on Earth and we are only that
[1:33:47] reflection the genuine object is
[1:33:49] somewhere if that isn't I'm the wor
[1:33:51] worst deceived man in the world I've
[1:33:53] spent my life in vain but I know beyond
[1:33:56] a shadow shadow of a doubt that it's
[1:33:58] there that's why we're
[1:34:02] here oh what courage that gives us
[1:34:05] friends what is that that's that image
[1:34:07] he had before the foundation of the
[1:34:08] world and he knows every stroke in our
[1:34:11] life what's he doing he the negative is
[1:34:13] going to reflect the positive and he's
[1:34:15] going to bring it from negative back to
[1:34:18] positive let's go to paragraph 41 over
[1:34:22] on page eight I'm sorry page nine right
[1:34:25] in the middle of page
[1:34:30] nine his toils and wearies and long
[1:34:33] nights and housed away from the world
[1:34:34] for days and maybe eat a sandwich and
[1:34:36] rub on it and get back and no that's
[1:34:38] just not the way it was now it's got to
[1:34:40] come down to this and rubbing it then
[1:34:42] when he saw it just perfect then he saw
[1:34:45] in reality the negative of what was in
[1:34:47] his mind had become real it became
[1:34:50] positive therefore it sprung into him
[1:34:52] and it was so real that he must cry
[1:34:55] speak praise God brother benam starts
[1:34:58] using this negative and
[1:35:00] positive and back in the day brother
[1:35:02] Brenham was preaching it wasn't like the
[1:35:04] day we're in now with digital
[1:35:05] photography but back in the day uh he
[1:35:09] was speaking of he was speaking of old
[1:35:11] photography where you take a picture and
[1:35:13] on the picture it imposes an image on
[1:35:16] the negative then you take the negative
[1:35:17] and you take it through a process of
[1:35:19] development and through development you
[1:35:21] bring back the image of the
[1:35:23] positive I know my kids don't know
[1:35:25] anything about what I'm talking
[1:35:27] about Blake might remember a negative he
[1:35:30] may have seen one in his lifetime but
[1:35:33] the rest of us remember that amen that
[1:35:35] that the light would come onto a piece
[1:35:37] of film and and it would impose a
[1:35:38] negative image on a piece of film and
[1:35:40] then it would have to go they take that
[1:35:42] piece of film which became a negative of
[1:35:44] the of the real object and it would have
[1:35:46] to go through a process in a dark room
[1:35:49] and in the dark room it would go through
[1:35:51] different different processes of
[1:35:52] chemicals and it would go from tray to
[1:35:53] tray and Washings and chemical dips and
[1:35:56] all kinds of things and drying amen and
[1:35:58] then it would have to it would have to
[1:35:59] come back into the image of the the
[1:36:01] reality and then it could be taken out
[1:36:03] of the dark room and now you have the
[1:36:05] image from the positive yeah well that's
[1:36:08] very much like our life because before
[1:36:10] there was ever this negative life down
[1:36:12] here there was the positive in the mind
[1:36:14] of God there's already the positive
[1:36:16] image that the negative's taken off and
[1:36:18] what are we doing now we're in the dark
[1:36:20] room right now coming back to the image
[1:36:22] of the
[1:36:24] positive what's all the chemical dipping
[1:36:27] and the washing and the drying and the
[1:36:28] proc what's this whole process this
[1:36:31] whole process is to take the negative
[1:36:32] form of this life back to reflect the
[1:36:35] perfect image of the positive that was
[1:36:37] in God's mind because the reality is in
[1:36:39] God's mind that's the real that's the
[1:36:41] true and now we're being brought back
[1:36:44] into the image of that now remember when
[1:36:47] your picture is developed you take the
[1:36:48] picture and you say that's Chad no
[1:36:51] that's a picture of Chad that's Chad in
[1:36:54] another form the original was the
[1:36:57] reality amen the original was the
[1:37:00] thought amen and that will always be the
[1:37:03] original but now God's going to take
[1:37:05] that thought and bring it into a triun
[1:37:07] being which will be a perfect reflection
[1:37:10] of that
[1:37:11] thought and we're developing back into
[1:37:14] that perfect image of the thought
[1:37:18] amen it's already there friends yeah
[1:37:21] it's
[1:37:22] finished brother R said if it's not I'm
[1:37:25] the most deceived man on the
[1:37:28] earth said I've lived my life in vain
[1:37:31] but he said I know I'm positive sure
[1:37:33] that it's there how could he be so sure
[1:37:36] cuz he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:37:37] and he's
[1:37:39] seen praise God all right I want to look
[1:37:42] at one more thing in paragraph 50 on
[1:37:45] page uh
[1:37:50] 10
[1:37:52] paragraph 50 on the bottom of page
[1:37:54] 10 and now to make the two one he put
[1:37:57] them like any great sculptor in the
[1:37:58] place that's beautiful a sculptor
[1:38:00] wouldn't make excuse me wouldn't make a
[1:38:03] Great Masterpiece and then take it and
[1:38:05] set it in an alley somewhere or hide it
[1:38:07] behind buildings as the Lord told us a
[1:38:09] man doesn't light a candle and put it
[1:38:11] under a bushel when we become God's
[1:38:13] masterpieces we're not hidden an alley
[1:38:15] somewhere we must give light that's our
[1:38:19] job now on the earth when God's molding
[1:38:21] us into his masterpieces into the image
[1:38:24] of what was in his mind we're not to
[1:38:26] live in an alley somewhere he's not
[1:38:28] putting us back behind the house but
[1:38:30] he's going to set us on the Candlestick
[1:38:32] for the light to shine God will put our
[1:38:34] life on
[1:38:36] display how will he do it all kinds of
[1:38:39] different situations hardship difficulty
[1:38:42] he'll he'll he'll put you in the
[1:38:43] different groups in different settings
[1:38:45] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:38:46] put that Masterpiece on display so his
[1:38:49] handiwork can be seen amen and when he
[1:38:52] finishes his work and he finally has a
[1:38:55] bride that's standing complete in the
[1:38:58] image he had of bride before the
[1:38:59] foundational world the end time bride
[1:39:01] that represents the entire seven Church
[1:39:03] ages in Perfection now perfectly
[1:39:05] reflecting the image of Jesus Christ I
[1:39:07] don't know how he'll put it on display
[1:39:10] but he's going to put it on display I
[1:39:12] don't know by what measures and I don't
[1:39:14] know by what mechanism but he'll put it
[1:39:16] on
[1:39:17] display he's not going to hide it under
[1:39:19] a bushel basket
[1:39:21] praise God let us be prepared for that
[1:39:24] time God bless you let's all Stand
[1:39:26] Together musicians if you'll come and
[1:39:28] Blake if you'll

[1:42:29] we love you we ask your blessings in
[1:42:31] Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless
[1:42:35] you all brother
[1:42:37] Blake well he is
[1:42:40] able
[1:42:41] more than
[1:42:45] able to accomplish what concerns me
[1:42:52] today he is
[1:42:55] able
[1:42:57] more than
[1:43:01] aable to handle anything that comes my
[1:43:08] way he is
[1:43:11] able more than
[1:43:16] aable to do much more than I could could
[1:43:21] ever
[1:43:24] dream he is
[1:43:27] able
[1:43:28] more than
[1:43:32] able to make me what he
[1:43:38] wants stop for a
[1:43:41] minute amen it was just on my heart to
[1:43:44] have special prayer for our brother
[1:43:45] Daniel Aaron as you know many of you
[1:43:48] know Daniel was struggling years ago he
[1:43:50] had a really struggle with depression
[1:43:52] and anxiety and it got really bad and
[1:43:55] then by the grace of God God delivered
[1:43:57] him amen we went to prayer and God
[1:43:58] supernaturally delivered him and he's
[1:44:01] had a a relapse over the last two weeks
[1:44:04] and he thinks maybe it's related to some
[1:44:06] medication he was taking but he wasn't
[1:44:07] sleeping his anxiety went off the charts
[1:44:09] and and the devil's really jumped on
[1:44:12] that old weakness that's in him but I
[1:44:14] want to stand together with a
[1:44:16] brother amen I you know if I was laying
[1:44:20] unconscious somewhere I couldn't pray
[1:44:22] for myself but I would expect all my
[1:44:24] brothers and sisters to join and pray
[1:44:25] with me and I just think it's a
[1:44:28] privilege that we can stand in the gap
[1:44:30] for our brother when he's struggling so
[1:44:32] bad right now when there's confusion and
[1:44:35] anxiety and we can stand in the Gap and
[1:44:39] we believe we know beyond a shadow of a
[1:44:41] doubt God hears our prayers that'll
[1:44:43] answer and he said if there's other two
[1:44:45] or three Gather in my name and that
[1:44:47] whatever they ask whenever they pray
[1:44:49] touching Heaven I'll hear from heaven
[1:44:51] and I'll answer so let's just bow our
[1:44:53] heads and pray
[1:44:55] together dear heavenly father we thank
[1:44:57] you Lord first of all we want to thank
