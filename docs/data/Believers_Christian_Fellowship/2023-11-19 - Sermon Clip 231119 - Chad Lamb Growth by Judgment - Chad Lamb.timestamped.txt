[0:00] for the word of God is quick and
[0:02] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[0:04] sword piercing even to the dividing aund
[0:06] of the soul and the spirit and of the
[0:07] joints and the tomorrow and is a
[0:09] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[0:12] the heart the heart is desperately
[0:14] wicked who can know it the word knows
[0:17] it absolutely the word knows it amen and
[0:20] that's why we still believe in fivefold
[0:22] Ministry and that's why we believe in
[0:24] live preaching of the word that God can
[0:26] anoint a man that take the sword of the
[0:28] word and cut you under till he separates
[0:31] your spirit and your soul because the
[0:33] heart is desperately wicked who can know
[0:35] it but the word is a discerner of the
[0:37] thoughts and intents of the heart so
[0:39] that when the word starts getting close
[0:41] and encroaching in on your problem don't
[0:43] get offended at the man that's preaching
[0:44] amen look at it and say woe is me God
[0:47] help me to be right with your word if
[0:49] you're pointing that at me I take it
[0:51] Lord fix me oh God humble me help me to
[0:56] surrender amen America is one of the
[0:59] hardest places in in the world to preach
[1:00] the gospel because America was based on
[1:03] Rebellion the spirit of patriotism and
[1:06] the spirit of America is a spirit of
[1:07] rebellion and it's one of the hardest
[1:09] places in the world to preach the gospel
[1:11] because there's rebellious Spirits in
[1:13] America and there's a self uh uh uh
[1:16] there there's a such a sense of self
[1:18] ability in America we've always been on
[1:21] the top we've always been able to
[1:22] figured out we led the world and all
[1:24] that but God is beginning to Humble
[1:26] America now because she's not going to
[1:27] be on the top very much longer
[1:31] amen sometimes what we need is just
[1:33] Contrition and humility and surrender
[1:37] because the word of God is the discerner
[1:40] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:42] that's why we come for
[1:44] preaching we come for encouragement for
[1:47] instruction and righteousness for
[1:49] reprove and rebuke we come for heart
[1:55] surgery sometimes things are so deep in
[1:57] our hearts wounds from when we were
[1:58] children Scars From the Past habits that
[2:02] set in generational things that were
[2:04] laid into us so long ago that we don't
[2:07] understand what happened rejection
[2:09] complexes that came from parents amen
[2:12] neglect that we suffered or Abus there's
[2:14] some things so deep in our heart we
[2:16] don't understand what's going on Amen
[2:18] but the grace of God he'll he'll take a
[2:20] man under his control and put the word
[2:23] of God in that man's mouth to come down
[2:25] and start to dive deep down into the
[2:27] heart and start to expose there's a
[2:29] problem problem here we've got to go
[2:31] deeper there's an issue laying here you
[2:33] got to go deeper something's laying
[2:35] there that's a
[2:37] problem we got to go
[2:39] deeper until that can be rooted out
[2:43] given to God and the coal can come and
[2:46] Purge and bring life and then he can say
[2:48] and now who will go for me say I'm here
[2:50] I'm here and I'm ready that's what I've
[2:52] always wanted was to serve you I've
[2:53] always wanted to do your
[2:56] will that's the purpose friends that's
[2:59] God's great desire
