TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this world is destined for destruction America cannot rise again she failed to turn at her turning point in 1956 and now she cannot write raise again and now it God has permitted another agency to control and now it's time for us not to fight the government not to fight the systems they're going to continue to get worse but it's to stand and the face of it all and whenever given the opportunity to stand for the word I can't do that because the Bible says I can't do that because the Bible says I won't do that because the word of God says that's what we're here for to prove to Satan that we do believe he is the same yesterday today and forever if it was wrong yesterday it's wrong today it'll be wrong forever that God's not changing his mind about his word it doesn't matter how far along the culture goes amen I'm not moving with the culture I'm staying with the word and just because everybody else says it's right doesn't make it right amen years ago we talked about the progression of immorality and the denominational church because the denominational system as long as they're not as bad as the world feel okay they're right so you look at the churches whatever they were 50 years ago is a drastic difference of what they are now there are some denominations that would not allow their women to wear pants just a hundred years ago some of the denominations now that will permit same-sex marriage wouldn't let their women wear pants or earrings or makeup and in a hundred years they've gone from not allowing the women Amen to dress like a man wear makeup or excessive jewelry and to now they'll marry two women together at their altar and there can be a lesbian or a homosexual priest that would perform the wedding how did they get there because they didn't believe God was the same yesterday today and forever they failed by the same thing he failed by hey she knew what the word was but she was made to believe that that word no longer counts in this situation and and it doesn't mean exactly like that for this and God won't judge and that's exactly what happened to the church but the problem is Amen in the message many message Believers have followed soon so as long as when the world goes here as long as the denomination church is back here and they say we're better than this standard then we're okay some of the message jerks have been following the denomination and as long as we're not as bad as the denomination we're okay but I said God help us not to fall into this trap I don't want to be a few degrees better than wrong I want to be right with the word of God if the prophet of God told us how to dress that's how we dress if the prophet of God told us how we conduct ourselves how we deal with one another how we live in the public how we whatever I mean we can we can go through all kinds of details but you get the point if the prophet of God taught it if the word of God is explicit on something that's still good today it was good amen it was good in 1969 it's still good in 2023. we shouldn't be changing with the times
