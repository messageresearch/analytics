========================================

And that's like what this message does to us. We go thinking that once we stop I remember when I thought, man, when I stop drinking and all drugging, all boy, I'm going to have it all. Nope. You just scratching the surface, brother. Right. And then that word starts coming and it starts doing heart surgery on us. Right. How many of us h have have been in a service and the preaching of the word comes at us so straight that it starts uncovering things in our lives that we didn't even realize was there to the service and that same thing happens. So what I what I what what to me what it means is when that second pool we saw it transition from the first into the second and it unlock something within that sister she didn't know she had. But the beautiful thing is is in that third pool when that third pool happened and that word unlocked to that prophet it unlocked something in him friends it unlocked the mystery of his life cuz remember when when when that when that seal released and he he said remember he said he said it was the thing that I wondered my whole life right what Was it what to me I hope you understand he wondered was he Malachi 4 or not was he revelation 10 1-7 was that him but when that sword did the hand come and and the seals became revealed he said it's the thing that I wanted my whole life he didn't know if he was just going to be making a platform for another man to step on or not but when that seven revealed it unlocked what the mystery of Damn. But listen, don't stop there. Because the third pool should unlock the mystery in you. Amen. Cuz it's not What was the whole point of the third pool? It wasn't so brother Brandham could fish. The whole point of the third pull was to catch you. Amen. Amen. It's when this message comes into our life, it unlocks the mystery within you. You You have to see that you are that covenant fish. When when when you listen to the seventh seal and brother Bam talks about the third pool, you have to realize, "Mama, that's me." When you listen to the three kind of believers and you're saying, "Amen. Amen." And you get to the pop quiz at the end of the message and Brother Bram says, "If you still got the tape on and you ain't turned it off and you're in agreement, you are a believer. You are a covenant fish.
