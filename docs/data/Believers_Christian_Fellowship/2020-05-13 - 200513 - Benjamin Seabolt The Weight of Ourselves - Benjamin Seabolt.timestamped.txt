[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] when
[0:27] when i found the joy of reaching
[0:31] your heart when my will becomes
[0:36] enthralled in your love
[0:40] when all things that surround
[0:56] shadows
[1:10] is
[1:38] is
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] as brother ben comes let's just sing
[1:45] this song
[1:46] lord my heart
[1:50] is open
[1:54] won't you come
[1:57] inside
[2:01] fill up all
[2:06] my
[2:18] [Applause]
[2:34] i
[2:48] is
[3:02] is
[3:16] foreign
[3:30] day
[3:34] praise the lord it's good to be here
[3:36] with you this evening
[3:38] we encountered a great privilege and a
[3:41] great honor i'd rather be in my seat but
[3:43] you all know how that works but i was
[3:46] just thinking as we were singing that
[3:48] song that is really dangerous words to
[3:50] say to the lord
[3:51] that you've opened all the windows and
[3:54] you've opened all the doors
[3:56] and come inside it's very dangerous
[4:00] words to say to the lord unless you mean
[4:02] it
[4:03] because when you say that he'll do it
[4:05] and we better be prepared for him to do
[4:07] that
[4:08] so but we know that we're gathered with
[4:10] a group of people that can say that from
[4:12] their heart
[4:13] and they can say that and that can mean
[4:15] that uh regardless of the
[4:17] the pain and the consequences and the
[4:19] inconveniences that
[4:20] that might cause them that that's truly
[4:23] their heart's desire
[4:25] so let's take our bibles and let's turn
[4:28] to psalm
[4:31] 19 thank you musicians
[4:34] we'll read a portion of scripture here
[4:36] and then let you
[4:37] have your seats just happen to be in the
[4:41] house of the lord this evening
[4:50] i have a thought here that i would like
[4:52] to
[4:53] present for the sake of a title we're
[4:55] going to call it
[4:56] uh the weight of ourselves
[5:00] and we'll maybe that'll be a little bit
[5:04] more clear to you once we get to these
[5:05] other scriptures but
[5:07] the the title would be the weight of our
[5:10] self
[5:12] and psalm 19
[5:15] verse 14 just one verse here
[5:19] says let the words of my mouth
[5:22] and the meditation of my heart be
[5:25] acceptable
[5:26] in thy sight o lord my strength
[5:29] and my redeemer let's just pray together
[5:33] precious lord jesus we just want to
[5:35] pause here a moment and
[5:37] thank you once again for this privilege
[5:38] to be here lord
[5:41] father we hold these times very dear and
[5:44] even more so as time would go on and
[5:47] they would be more sacred to us father
[5:50] may we never take it for granted that we
[5:52] would be able to gather together and
[5:54] to be able to see each other lord and to
[5:57] physically gather around your word
[5:59] lord we would just ask now that as we
[6:01] would come to this great juncture of the
[6:03] service father
[6:06] lord we stand here as a man that is
[6:08] completely
[6:10] incapable of doing what's been tasked
[6:13] with doing lord
[6:14] there is nothing good within myself
[6:16] father there is no capabilities there's
[6:19] no intellect there's nothing that i have
[6:21] to present to the people to help them or
[6:23] to encourage them lord
[6:24] but we just come here based on your word
[6:27] and based upon a gift that you've placed
[6:29] lord
[6:29] and we just ask for you to come and have
[6:31] the preeminence and do that
[6:33] which only you can do lord for it's only
[6:35] the lamb that can take the book and to
[6:37] and to loose the seals father lord we
[6:40] just stand here as a vessel and nothing
[6:42] more so we just asked that you would
[6:43] come and take the preeminence and both
[6:45] the speaker and the hearer
[6:47] and that your supernatural divine
[6:48] purpose for this service will be
[6:50] accomplished here this evening
[6:52] we commit ourselves to you with
[6:53] thanksgiving in jesus christ's name
[6:56] the bride says amen god bless you as you
[6:59] would
[7:00] have your seat so if you look at this
[7:02] portion of scripture
[7:03] i started to title this god don't
[7:06] stutter
[7:07] but i thought that might sound a little
[7:11] redneck so
[7:12] i didn't title with that but the psalm
[7:15] here says let the words of my mouth
[7:18] end so we immediately go to a
[7:21] conjunction
[7:22] so it says let the words of my mouth and
[7:26] the meditation of my heart be acceptable
[7:29] in thy sight o lord so we realize
[7:33] that if that is the prayer that david is
[7:36] having here he's saying let the
[7:38] meditation of my
[7:39] uh let the words of my mouth and the
[7:40] meditation of my heart be acceptable
[7:42] that means that you can actually have
[7:44] the right words coming out of your mouth
[7:46] with a wrong heart
[7:51] and you can fool a lot of people with
[7:52] that you might even fool yourself with
[7:55] that
[7:56] but you can't fool him with that so
[7:59] david recognizes
[8:01] this paradox that he's in and he's he's
[8:04] offering a sincere prayer to the lord
[8:07] that i don't
[8:08] want to just talk right i don't want to
[8:11] just act
[8:11] right i don't want to just look right
[8:14] but i want to be right and i want my
[8:17] heart to be right
[8:19] because as much as a paradox is having
[8:22] the right words coming out of your mouth
[8:24] with a wrong heart it's even more of a
[8:26] paradox you can have the right heart and
[8:28] everything else
[8:29] be wrong and you'll still be okay
[8:35] the heart is the important part
[8:39] and the heart is what only god can get
[8:43] to
[8:44] a minister can stand here he can present
[8:46] the word
[8:47] he can present the message but the heart
[8:51] is something only god can get to
[8:55] we can fool each other we can fool the
[8:58] minister
[9:00] but we we can't fool god and if we're
[9:04] his seed
[9:04] we're not going to fool ourselves he's
[9:07] going to let us know
[9:09] something's off and this is
[9:13] you know this is heart heart surgery as
[9:15] a figure of speech but i guess it's
[9:17] applicable physically as well
[9:19] but this is this is a heart surgery of
[9:21] heart surgeries because
[9:23] again you can set under the inspired
[9:25] preaching of the word
[9:27] and you can look right and you can act
[9:29] right
[9:30] and you can even do right but yet your
[9:32] heart won't be right
[9:34] and only you will know that and that
[9:37] would be an
[9:38] awful condition to be in
[9:41] and only you would know that unless
[9:45] there is a
[9:46] gift that god would allow to come and
[9:50] speak to you
[9:52] to make that known a gift of discernment
[9:54] or
[9:55] a word of knowledge or whatever the case
[9:57] may be unless god would
[9:58] supernaturally come and bring that to
[10:02] your attention
[10:03] to let you know you're not fooling
[10:04] everybody
[10:06] you could set in that condition
[10:10] so we have we have to look at this very
[10:13] seriously
[10:15] because at the end of the day if we're
[10:17] counting
[10:18] on anybody else but ourselves
[10:21] to get us right it's not going to work
[10:25] because it's going to come to the point
[10:28] in time here i go with the doomsday
[10:30] preaching already
[10:32] i made it about five minutes so i'm
[10:34] improving
[10:36] but it's going to come to the point in
[10:38] time saints that we're not going to have
[10:40] somebody to lean on
[10:43] it's going to be an individual affair
[10:46] it's going to be an
[10:47] individual walk we're not going to be
[10:49] able to run and cry to the pastor we're
[10:51] not going to be able to run and cry to
[10:52] another minister
[10:53] we may not even be able to run and cry
[10:55] to our spouse
[10:56] it's going to come to that time and
[10:58] david i think recognizes this
[11:01] and that's why he's saying lord don't
[11:03] just let the words of my mouth be right
[11:06] but let the meditation of my heart be
[11:09] right
[11:10] because david knows if he can get to
[11:11] that point that he's going to be just
[11:13] fine
[11:15] so let's skip over let's skip back
[11:18] brother to
[11:18] genesis 26 and i want to look at
[11:22] a couple scriptures here i'll just be
[11:25] you know very very opaque with you
[11:29] and and very clear with you this evening
[11:31] i've got two scriptures that i know that
[11:33] he wants me to tie together
[11:34] and after that whatever happens happens
[11:37] um so we may be here for 15 minutes we
[11:39] may be here for three hours i don't know
[11:41] but i know that we're supposed to tie
[11:43] these two scriptures together
[11:44] and the rest of it's up to you all so i
[11:47] would present that as a challenge
[11:48] um you know i'm not here with an agenda
[11:51] i'm not here to present a thought to you
[11:53] or to teach you something
[11:54] if you have a need from the lord tonight
[11:56] get it um
[11:57] that's that's all that i can say so um
[12:00] you know i stand here and and i'll do my
[12:03] best but
[12:04] you know sometimes sometimes it's very
[12:06] clear what we're to teach and what
[12:08] what percent and sometimes that does
[12:10] take three hours
[12:11] you all are we're aware with me but you
[12:13] know it's sometimes it's just the direct
[12:15] opposite of that sometimes you have a
[12:17] a couple of scriptures and and you just
[12:19] have to go with that so
[12:20] we'll tie these together and uh and see
[12:23] what happens but in genesis 26 verse 12
[12:27] we know this story very very familiar
[12:30] because it it speaks directly of us and
[12:32] our age
[12:33] we know this is elegies are going to
[12:35] fetch a bride for isaac
[12:37] but in verse 12 it says and he said oh
[12:40] lord
[12:41] this is eliezer speaking o lord god of
[12:44] my master abraham i pray thee
[12:46] send me good speed this day and show
[12:49] kindness
[12:50] unto my master abraham you'll notice
[12:55] the intent that eliezer begins with
[12:58] he's he is asking something of god
[13:02] but he's not asking it for himself
[13:09] i wonder sometimes if our prayers aren't
[13:11] answered because we're always praying
[13:12] for ourself
[13:16] brother branham says a gifts not even
[13:18] for the person with the gift
[13:20] but the gift he said his gift was for
[13:22] other people he said the same thing
[13:24] about jesus
[13:24] that he was there to serve other people
[13:26] he says eternal life was living for
[13:28] others
[13:30] i'm not saying we can't pray for ourself
[13:32] we should pray for ourselves
[13:34] i do quite a bit of it but i'm just
[13:36] wondering
[13:37] if there's not another channel that we
[13:39] should get into
[13:40] and eliezer is is
[13:44] representing that channel here to us he
[13:47] is coming with a purpose
[13:49] he is coming speaking to god but he's
[13:51] not even wanting anything for himself
[13:54] he's wanting something for his master
[13:56] abraham
[13:58] so you'll notice that not only are the
[14:00] words coming out
[14:01] out of his mouth correct but the
[14:03] meditation of his heart is correct
[14:06] this is not a selfish desire
[14:09] to be quite frank if eliezer was selfish
[14:13] he wouldn't have been one he wouldn't
[14:14] have been wanting to find a wife for
[14:16] isaac
[14:18] because that diminishes his portion in
[14:20] the scripture
[14:22] if he would really think about that this
[14:24] is a suicide mission
[14:27] because once he finds the bride for
[14:29] isaac he's done
[14:31] it you'll notice eliezer didn't have a
[14:33] problem with that
[14:35] he wanted what his master wanted and
[14:38] that was his prayer
[14:41] show kindness unto my master abraham
[14:43] behold i stand here by the well of water
[14:46] and the daughters of the men of the city
[14:47] come out to draw water
[14:49] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[14:51] to whom i shall say let down thy picture
[14:53] i pray thee
[14:54] that i may drink and she shall she shall
[14:58] say drink and i will give thy camel's
[15:01] drink also
[15:02] let the same be she that thou hast
[15:05] appointed
[15:05] for my servant isaac and thereby shall i
[15:09] know
[15:09] that thou has showed kindness unto my
[15:12] master
[15:13] and it came to pass before he had done
[15:16] speaking
[15:17] that behold rebecca came out who was
[15:20] born to bethel son of
[15:22] milka this the wife of nahor abraham's
[15:25] brother
[15:26] with her picture upon her shoulder and
[15:29] the damsel was very fair to look upon
[15:32] i want to stop here for a second go back
[15:33] to this first thing this uh
[15:36] this verse 15. i find this amazing that
[15:39] but
[15:40] as and it came to pass before he had
[15:43] done
[15:43] speaking i mean
[15:47] this is a this is a channel saints
[15:50] this is actually a millennial channel
[15:55] because in the millennium we know that
[15:56] as we would think something and before
[15:58] we would speak it
[15:59] the need would be met look at the
[16:01] position
[16:03] that he is in before he even finishes
[16:06] his prayer
[16:07] before he's done speaking
[16:11] this these things start coming into
[16:13] action and this bride presents itself
[16:16] and i would say that to bring attention
[16:20] to a fact that we have to be very
[16:24] careful of how we view the people that's
[16:26] went before us
[16:28] because we know as we're coming down to
[16:29] the very last closing seconds of time
[16:31] that there's been generations before us
[16:34] that never walked in the fullness of the
[16:35] message
[16:36] they had they received portions of the
[16:39] message coming down
[16:40] but they never they don't see what we
[16:42] see and some of them
[16:43] went off the scene by by way of the
[16:45] grave but you'll notice
[16:47] that god cared for those people so much
[16:49] that he put their
[16:50] place in the scripture here because
[16:52] there was a
[16:53] people on the face of this earth that
[16:56] before our prophet got
[16:57] done speaking before his ministry
[17:00] ended they were believing him and they
[17:03] were
[17:04] walking with him and they were acting
[17:05] with that
[17:07] and god cared so much about that that he
[17:09] put that nugget in there
[17:11] because it would have been just as easy
[17:12] for the scripture to say and after he
[17:14] got done speaking that rebecca showed up
[17:17] but god laid that in there for that
[17:19] generation that went before us
[17:22] so let's not be critical of that let's
[17:24] recognize that
[17:25] for what it was and be thankful for what
[17:27] it was because no matter what weight
[17:30] that generation carried before us even
[17:32] if it was just a slight weight of
[17:33] holding that message up
[17:35] it's allowed us to be in the position
[17:36] that we're in
[17:38] and that was important to god so much so
[17:41] that he would lay that type in there
[17:45] and the damsel was very fair to look
[17:47] upon
[17:49] a virgin neither had any man known her
[17:53] and she went down to the well and filled
[17:55] her picture and came up
[17:58] and this is the scripture that i'm
[17:59] basing all of this on
[18:01] that was just really caught my attention
[18:04] because whenever i see redundancies in
[18:07] the scripture
[18:09] i know that god don't stutter
[18:13] and he's saying something for a reason
[18:17] so it comes here to verse 16 and it says
[18:20] the damsel was very fair to look upon
[18:22] a virgin neither had any man known her
[18:28] so it begs the question what's the
[18:30] difference
[18:32] if no man's known her she's a virgin if
[18:35] she's a virgin no man has known her
[18:38] so is god just filling up ink blots on
[18:41] paper
[18:42] does he stutter does he
[18:45] think we need to hear it twice or is
[18:48] there something he's wanting to catch
[18:49] our attention with
[18:53] let the words of my mouth and
[18:57] the meditation of my heart be acceptable
[19:01] in thy sight o lord
[19:04] so we know that we're rebecca in this
[19:06] situation
[19:08] so as rebecca is coming to this well she
[19:11] is in
[19:12] she is in a certain condition
[19:15] and this is the same condition that we
[19:17] as the bride of jesus christ
[19:18] must be in in order to have
[19:22] to meet isaac and to go into the
[19:23] marriage to
[19:25] be even called by the messenger to be
[19:28] accepted by the messenger
[19:30] and the condition that she came to that
[19:34] well in
[19:35] was she was fair to look upon she was a
[19:37] virgin
[19:38] and no man had known her
[19:42] obviously there's children present we're
[19:44] in a mixed audience i don't want to
[19:45] go into graphic details there but it
[19:48] obviously shows that a person
[19:50] that a woman can be a virgin and be
[19:53] known by a man
[19:57] think about how awful that would be you
[20:00] come
[20:01] you get married to a lady
[20:04] you're there your first week you go out
[20:07] to a restaurant
[20:09] and she orders whatever her favorite is
[20:12] the guy sits down on the table next to
[20:14] you
[20:15] and he says oh i'm gonna make up a name
[20:19] so
[20:19] susie i see that chicken and dumplings
[20:22] is still your favorite
[20:26] he already knows something about your
[20:28] wife
[20:32] see what i'm saying that this woman is
[20:34] already known by another man
[20:36] and we can go through a list of examples
[20:38] i'm not going to go through that but it
[20:39] may be what her favorite collar is it
[20:41] may be
[20:42] whether she likes daisies or daffodils
[20:44] it may be whatever
[20:45] whatever the case may be but the point
[20:47] is
[20:48] rebecca was not in this condition
[20:51] rebecca was not a flirter
[20:54] rebecca was a virgin and
[20:58] she had not flirted with any other man
[21:01] there was no other man that knew her
[21:03] there was no other worldly entertainment
[21:05] that knew her
[21:07] she was a virgin and
[21:10] no man had known her satan
[21:13] did not know what her vices were
[21:17] satan did not know what her weaknesses
[21:19] were she was in a
[21:21] pristine condition
[21:24] she had not been out flirting with the
[21:26] world she had not been out flirting with
[21:28] anything else
[21:30] she was in a pristine condition awaiting
[21:33] the arrival of the messenger that would
[21:35] introduce her to her husband
[21:37] so we can we notice here that there is
[21:40] there can be a difference
[21:43] because obviously the the virginity that
[21:47] is that's a
[21:48] physical physical act so even besides of
[21:51] a
[21:51] physical act that woman can be known
[21:54] and like i said what a condition that
[21:56] would be for a man to take
[21:58] to take a wife and every
[22:01] every man in the community knows every
[22:03] all of her secrets and everything about
[22:05] her and what she likes and what she
[22:06] don't like
[22:10] known by everybody in the community but
[22:12] yet
[22:14] physically technically a virgin
[22:19] see this is the point that david was
[22:20] getting at with his prayer
[22:24] david didn't want to be in any type of
[22:27] condition like that he wanted his words
[22:30] to be right
[22:31] he wanted his his heart to be right
[22:35] he wanted to look right he wanted to act
[22:37] right and he wanted to
[22:38] be right and he didn't want all
[22:41] of everything on the surface being okay
[22:44] and underneath
[22:48] being full of adultery being known
[22:52] by every vice that came along by every
[22:54] tactic of the devil that came along
[22:57] by every little switch and sway he
[23:00] wanted to be in a pristine condition
[23:03] so i feel that this is this was laid in
[23:05] the scripture purposely
[23:07] because if you'll go to hebrews 12 with
[23:09] me
[23:13] hebrews 12 and verse 1 you'll see that
[23:16] paul
[23:18] picks this very thought up so we've seen
[23:21] it in psalms
[23:22] we've seen it in genesis but now we come
[23:25] we come to hebrews chapter 12
[23:28] verse 1 and it says wherefore seeing we
[23:31] also are encompassed about with so great
[23:33] a cloud of witnesses
[23:35] let us lay aside every weight and
[23:39] the sin which doth so easily beset us
[23:42] and let us run with patience the race
[23:45] that is set before us looking unto jesus
[23:49] the author and finisher of our faith
[23:51] who for the joy that was set before him
[23:53] endured the cross
[23:55] despising the shame and is set down at
[23:58] the right hand of the throne
[24:00] of god so there in verse 1 you see
[24:03] paul picks up this same thought and he
[24:05] says
[24:06] not let's not just lay aside every sin
[24:10] that besets us
[24:12] but he says let's lay aside every weight
[24:16] so now because he's differentiating
[24:19] between this we can realize that you can
[24:21] be in a
[24:22] sin free condition but yet completely
[24:25] weighted down
[24:28] completely weighted down by the cares of
[24:30] the world
[24:31] completely weighted down by yourself and
[24:34] that's where my title it came from
[24:36] because you know this is a this is a
[24:38] good scripture to preach holiness on
[24:40] right i mean we could take this
[24:41] scripture and just
[24:43] you know as they say shuck the corn with
[24:46] it you know preach
[24:47] preach holiness good but that's that's
[24:49] not my intention here
[24:52] my intention here is i want you to look
[24:54] at these scriptures
[24:55] because i think it's important as we
[24:57] move forward
[24:58] we have to understand what's going on
[25:01] with us
[25:03] because i am thoroughly convinced that
[25:05] i'm standing before a group of people
[25:07] who is not interested in sin
[25:12] but yet your trials you and i both know
[25:15] your trials and your tribulations are
[25:17] getting heavier
[25:18] and heavier and harder and harder and
[25:21] more precise and more precise
[25:23] to your breaking point
[25:27] why is that if you are free from sin
[25:31] because paul says let us lay aside every
[25:34] weight
[25:35] that so easily besets us
[25:39] and the sin he's
[25:42] he paul is wanting us to recognize
[25:45] that there there is a condition that we
[25:47] can come to as sin
[25:49] free and we know as we know that that is
[25:52] just unbelief
[25:53] we can believe the word we can be living
[25:56] the word
[25:56] we can be acting the word we can be
[25:58] talking the word but yet within
[26:00] ourselves
[26:02] within our dna with our within our
[26:04] genetic
[26:05] hybrid makeup there can be weights
[26:08] within that that can beset us
[26:13] and that can keep us from manifesting
[26:15] what christ is wanting us to manifest
[26:18] and that can keep us out of the pristine
[26:20] condition that rebecca was in
[26:23] so this is this is not you know a
[26:25] scripture that i want to take and
[26:27] start hacking you know hacking holiness
[26:30] and
[26:31] you know hacking away at chris or
[26:33] christianity and
[26:34] you know you know making you feel
[26:36] condemned or bad that's
[26:38] that's not my intention here my
[26:40] intention is just to make us recognize
[26:41] that there's two parts there
[26:44] there is two parts and i'm convinced
[26:49] as i said that i'm with a group of
[26:50] people who's not interested in living in
[26:52] sin
[26:53] i'm convinced that i'm with a group of
[26:55] people who is seeking out
[26:56] any sin that would be in their life and
[26:58] quickly repenting of that and getting
[27:00] that out of the way but yet things just
[27:02] get
[27:03] tougher and tougher and harder
[27:07] and harder so we have to
[27:11] we have to stop and we have to recognize
[27:14] what is that that's pressing on us
[27:19] if it's not sin what is it that's
[27:22] pressing on us
[27:23] and i wonder sometimes if that's not
[27:25] simply the weight
[27:27] of our self
[27:30] the weight of our genetic
[27:33] the weight of hybridization as it came
[27:36] has come down through our family trees
[27:39] and understand that
[27:41] these weights these weights
[27:44] may have very some of them may have
[27:47] very good qualities
[27:50] for certain situations
[27:55] certain situations that quality that is
[27:58] there in your genetics and in your dna
[28:01] can be very beneficial but yet in
[28:04] another situation it can be absolutely
[28:07] detrimental
[28:09] and that's why we've got to come back to
[28:11] david's prayer to let the meditation of
[28:13] my
[28:14] heart be acceptable because we've got to
[28:17] recognize
[28:18] that something that with within us
[28:21] in our makeup can be right and it can be
[28:24] right and it can be right and god can
[28:25] use it here and he can use it here and
[28:27] he can use it here
[28:28] and then all of a sudden there'll come a
[28:29] situation here
[28:31] and we'll find ourselves beating our
[28:32] head against the wall
[28:36] because we've leaned to our genetic
[28:39] makeup
[28:40] because we've seen it work and we've
[28:42] seen god use it
[28:44] and there's nothing wrong with it it's
[28:47] not sinful
[28:48] it's simply the weight of our self
[28:52] and god is going to make sure that he
[28:54] strips that away from us
[28:57] so that we do not lean on any of that
[29:01] and that we lean solely on him and that
[29:04] it's by revelation that we're leaning on
[29:06] him
[29:08] not past experience
[29:11] so paul clearly differentiates that
[29:14] there is a difference there
[29:15] and he's and he's doing that so that we
[29:17] would know see our
[29:19] again the situation we find ourselves in
[29:23] is unlike any other because it's it's
[29:26] not just enough to overcome this age and
[29:30] to overcome laodicea
[29:32] we are in a position that we have to
[29:34] overcome ourself
[29:36] even in a sinless condition you
[29:39] understand what i'm saying when i say a
[29:40] sinless condition
[29:41] we know that we're in hybridization and
[29:43] we're going to fight that till the day
[29:44] that our atoms change
[29:46] but as far as a desire for sin or a
[29:48] desire to do
[29:50] to do wrong or being okay with that that
[29:53] is
[29:53] not there but we've got to move a step
[29:56] farther and we have got to examine
[29:58] ourselves
[29:59] and again that's going to be limited
[30:02] from a minister
[30:03] that's going to be limited of how god
[30:05] can do that that's going to be an
[30:07] individual examination
[30:10] and that's the only way that it'll work
[30:14] let's go to ephesians 5 27
[30:19] and you'll see this trend continue in
[30:21] the scripture
[30:22] ephesians 5 verse 27 says that he might
[30:26] present it to himself
[30:27] a glorious church not having spot
[30:31] or wrinkle why is it so important that
[30:35] it don't have a spot
[30:37] or a wrinkle why isn't it okay
[30:40] just to be spot-free i mean if i come to
[30:42] you and i say brother
[30:43] brother and sister you are spot-free you
[30:46] would probably feel pretty good about
[30:48] yourself right
[30:49] but then i say but you're full of
[30:50] wrinkles
[30:52] well you just told me i was spot free
[30:55] but you're full of wrinkles
[30:58] but the scripture differentiates
[31:01] so it's almost one of those things it's
[31:02] like i'm just never good enough
[31:04] i'm completely spot-free i stand before
[31:07] god i mean how many would like to have
[31:08] that testimony i stand before god
[31:10] completely spot-free
[31:13] and he says good job now go iron out the
[31:16] wrinkles
[31:18] that's the point that we're called to
[31:22] and that wrinkle is not a spot
[31:26] the spot is a sin the spot is a blemish
[31:29] the spot is something wrong that needs
[31:31] cleaned out the wrinkle
[31:34] how do you get a wrinkle in a garment by
[31:37] not using it
[31:42] that's the only way to get a wrinkle in
[31:43] a garment if you're wearing that garment
[31:45] the wrinkles are going to fade out
[31:49] the reason we get wrinkles is our faith
[31:52] is not an action
[31:53] the word is not in action the word is
[31:56] not being worn on a daily basis
[31:58] it's been folded up and put in a drawer
[32:00] somewhere and it gets wrinkles
[32:03] that shirt may be spotless
[32:07] no ketchup on it no mustard
[32:10] no baby slobbers but if it's tucked away
[32:14] folded up nice and neat
[32:16] in a drawer what good is it
[32:20] and when you get that shirt out in a
[32:22] spotless condition
[32:25] it has wrinkles in it that don't bother
[32:28] me
[32:29] might bother some of you but in a
[32:32] spiritual sense
[32:33] that bothers god because he says i will
[32:36] have a
[32:37] church without spot
[32:41] blemish without a desire for sin without
[32:45] sin in their lives
[32:46] without flirting with the world and
[32:50] she will be without wrinkle she will be
[32:52] manifesting my word
[32:54] she will not just be talking about it
[32:56] she will not just be
[32:58] acting like it she will be wearing it on
[33:00] a daily basis
[33:09] there's only one thing that gets
[33:11] wrinkles out
[33:13] and that's heat i'll take that back
[33:16] there's two things
[33:17] heat and pressure
[33:22] heat and pressure
[33:25] so i want to go back to what i was
[33:27] saying earlier this is not to condemn
[33:29] anybody
[33:30] this is not to rip anybody up one side
[33:31] and down into the other
[33:33] this is to maybe help you understand
[33:36] what is going on and what is going to
[33:37] keep going on
[33:38] and get more intense with your
[33:40] individual walk
[33:42] god is going to get the wrinkles out and
[33:45] that is going to be heat
[33:47] and that is going to be pressure
[33:50] and you will be in a sinless condition
[33:59] when the heat and the pressure comes
[34:04] what that's going to do is two things
[34:06] it's going to drive you to your knees
[34:07] and you are going to make sure you don't
[34:09] have any spots on you
[34:13] and then you're going to want god to
[34:16] deal
[34:16] with whatever wrinkle that is and you're
[34:19] going to want him to
[34:20] iron that out as quickly as possible
[34:22] because the longer the iron sets on
[34:24] there
[34:25] the hotter it gets and the more pressure
[34:27] it gets
[34:29] that does not mean that you are in a
[34:32] sinful condition
[34:33] just because you are dealing with heat
[34:35] and pressure in your individual walk
[34:38] you may be perfectly spotless before god
[34:42] and god is simply wanting to get a
[34:44] wrinkle
[34:46] out of that hybrid nature that has come
[34:48] down through your tree
[34:50] that may not even be any fault of your
[34:52] own
[34:53] and confusing as it is that he may be
[34:56] able to use
[34:57] nine out of ten situations for his glory
[35:00] and it will be automatic to you and
[35:01] you'll never even think about it
[35:03] but in this situation you'll lean on
[35:06] automatic
[35:08] and you'll lean on your your condition
[35:11] your genetic condition
[35:13] and it's not him doing it it's just your
[35:16] genetic makeup
[35:18] and he won't tolerate that that's not
[35:20] what he's after
[35:22] what he's after is a complete surrender
[35:24] from each and every one of us that
[35:26] he is doing everything in every
[35:29] situation
[35:32] so he will deal with those wrinkles
[35:36] and a wrinkle i can't emphasize is
[35:38] enough a wrinkle is not a spot
[35:40] so when the heat and the pressure comes
[35:42] i'm not saying that we shouldn't go to
[35:43] our knees
[35:44] and we shouldn't check our life because
[35:45] we should we should but after we have
[35:47] checked our lives
[35:48] and we've made sure there's not a spot
[35:50] there
[35:52] quit dumping bleach on a wrinkle
[35:56] it's not going to work you don't need
[35:59] two drops of the blood of jesus christ
[36:01] one drop will suffice
[36:04] don't question do not
[36:08] question the integrity
[36:11] of your heart once you've checked it and
[36:13] once you've covered that with the blood
[36:15] brother branham says so many times we
[36:17] get confused that it's god
[36:19] punishing us about stuff and it's not
[36:22] that at all
[36:23] he's simply as with job he was simply
[36:26] wanting job to ask him a question
[36:30] job went through all of that because god
[36:33] wanted to ask him a ques
[36:34] he wanted god wanted job to ask him a
[36:36] question
[36:39] i mean that's mind-boggling to us
[36:43] but everything job went to was to get
[36:45] him to the point that he would ask that
[36:46] question of the god
[36:49] so it wasn't that job backslid it wasn't
[36:51] that job got out in sin
[36:53] job knew where he stood
[36:56] we should be the same second peter 3 14
[36:59] it says wherefore beloved seem that ye
[37:01] look for such things
[37:03] be diligent that ye may be found of him
[37:05] in peace
[37:06] without spot and blameless
[37:11] without spot and blameless
[37:16] john 14 verse 14
[37:20] if ye shall ask anything in my name i
[37:22] will do it and if you love me
[37:24] keep my commandments and i will pray the
[37:27] father and he shall give you another
[37:28] comforter that he may abide with you
[37:30] forever
[37:31] even the spirit of truth
[37:34] whom the world cannot receive
[37:37] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[37:41] him
[37:42] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[37:46] and shall be in you
[37:50] why is it with you good enough
[37:56] why does he have to be in you or does
[37:59] god stutter
[38:04] he dwelleth with you
[38:07] and he will be and he shall be in you
[38:13] with you is not good enough saints
[38:18] with you is not good enough
[38:21] if you'll go back to genesis you don't
[38:23] have to turn there but if you'll go back
[38:24] to genesis
[38:25] that is actually the condition eve was
[38:27] in because the scripture says that she
[38:30] took and she gave also to her husband
[38:32] with her adam being with eve
[38:36] did not keep her adam had to be in eve
[38:40] that was the only thing that would
[38:41] prevented that
[38:44] so now jesus comes and
[38:47] he picks this thought up this principle
[38:50] up
[38:51] and he gives us a word for it because
[38:55] these conditions that we've just listed
[38:57] here of rebecca
[38:59] being a virgin neither had any man known
[39:02] her
[39:04] laying aside every sin and every weight
[39:08] being without spot without wrinkle
[39:11] being blameless
[39:14] these are not something that's going to
[39:16] be accomplished
[39:17] with him just being with us
[39:21] this is only going to be accomplished by
[39:23] him being in us
[39:26] you can look right act right and talk
[39:28] right if he's with you
[39:30] but your heart will never be right
[39:32] unless he is in it
[39:34] and you may be the only one that knows
[39:36] that
[39:37] but he's given us a word to meet the
[39:39] challenge
[39:41] he has given us a way to make that work
[39:44] i will be with you even in you
[39:48] first john 3 18 says my little children
[39:52] let us
[39:52] not love in word neither in tongue but
[39:55] in deed and in truth
[39:57] and hereby we know that we are of truth
[39:59] and shall assure our hearts before him
[40:01] for if our heart condemn us not or i'm
[40:04] sorry for if our heart condemn us
[40:06] god is greater than our heart and
[40:08] knoweth all things
[40:10] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[40:13] then we have confidence towards god
[40:16] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[40:19] because we keep his commandments and do
[40:22] those things that are pleasing in his
[40:23] sight
[40:26] this is a condition given
[40:29] to answered prayers if your heart
[40:32] condemn you not
[40:34] then we have confidence towards god
[40:37] this is the scripture brother branham
[40:38] picks up
[40:40] um or the thought that brother branham
[40:43] picks up in perfect faith
[40:46] he says and now we're going to turn to
[40:47] mark saint mark the 11th chapter
[40:49] and we're going to begin to read about
[40:51] the 22nd verse of the 11th chapter of
[40:53] saint mark
[40:54] and many of you know this scripture it's
[40:56] very familiar it was the scripture i was
[40:58] thinking on
[41:00] when those squirrels when he said to me
[41:02] about those squirrels
[41:05] those was the very scripture i was
[41:06] thinking about it's been a puzzle he
[41:08] said
[41:08] if ye say not if i say but if you
[41:12] say now let me read jesus answering said
[41:15] unto them
[41:16] have faith in god for verily i say unto
[41:19] you that whosoever shall say
[41:21] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[41:23] be cast into the sea
[41:25] and shall doubt and shall not doubt in
[41:27] his heart
[41:28] but shall believe that those things
[41:30] which he saith shall come to pass
[41:32] he shall have whatsoever he ask
[41:38] therefore i say unto you what things
[41:41] soever you desire when you pray
[41:43] believe that you receive them and you
[41:45] shall have them
[41:47] and when you stand praying forgive
[41:50] if you have ought against any
[41:53] that your father
[41:57] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[42:01] your trespasses but if you do not
[42:04] forgive
[42:05] neither will your father which is in
[42:06] heaven forgive your trespasses
[42:10] now faith this is brother brandon
[42:12] speaking now faith
[42:14] is based on forgiveness then
[42:18] so we just we just had a teaching on how
[42:22] faith worketh by love
[42:26] but faith which works by love is based
[42:30] on forgiveness
[42:35] how profound that is and it ties right
[42:39] into that scripture if our
[42:40] heart condemner condemn us not then we
[42:43] have
[42:44] confidence
[42:47] see if we have spots on our life we're
[42:50] not going to have confidence towards god
[42:54] we have to get the spots out of our life
[42:57] we have to get the blemishes out of our
[42:58] life
[42:59] we have to allow him to get those out of
[43:01] our life
[43:03] but when it comes to wrinkles that are
[43:05] in our life
[43:07] wrinkles on our garment
[43:10] that does not need the bleach anymore
[43:13] that just needs heat and pressure and
[43:16] that needs a
[43:17] confidence towards god
[43:20] so don't go back and start re
[43:24] um like i said re-dipping it in bleach
[43:27] if you're trying to get a wrinkle out
[43:29] don't go back and start questioning
[43:32] whether your heart is condemning you or
[43:33] not
[43:34] if your heart's condemning you deal with
[43:36] that problem
[43:38] but once you have dealt with that
[43:39] problem we
[43:41] have to accept the fact that we now have
[43:45] confidence towards god
[43:47] because if if his blood and
[43:50] his forgiveness is not enough to take
[43:53] care of that
[43:54] if you repenting of whatever it is that
[43:56] he has checked you in your heart
[43:59] if you repenting of that is not enough
[44:02] to cover that
[44:03] i i beg you to tell me what will
[44:07] i mean do we have a plan b do we have
[44:10] another option
[44:12] is there's can you fast long enough to
[44:14] make it go away can you pray harder
[44:16] or more or whatever the case may be to
[44:19] make it go away
[44:20] say if we get on our knees and we repent
[44:22] and we ask for forgiveness
[44:23] we've got to leave it there we've got to
[44:26] leave it there
[44:27] because as soon as you pick that up john
[44:30] 14 will never work for you
[44:33] john 14 will never work for you and you
[44:35] will never get rid of the wrinkles in
[44:37] your life
[44:38] when you're constantly dealing with
[44:40] spots that don't even exist
[44:43] you will never allow him to deal with
[44:45] the wrinkles in your life
[44:47] if you keep wanting to throw it in
[44:49] bleach and deal with the spots
[44:51] let the spots be deal dealt with
[44:54] let them be in the past god is not i am
[44:58] convinced i am
[44:59] i am standing before a group of people
[45:01] that god is not interested in dealing
[45:03] with your spots he's dealt with them
[45:04] saints
[45:05] i believe you dealt with them before you
[45:07] came through the doors
[45:08] god is at the point he is wanting to
[45:10] deal with our very dna makeup
[45:13] he is wanting to deal with the very
[45:15] wrinkles that our genetics is throwing
[45:17] at us
[45:18] and he is wanting to iron those out
[45:21] and i'm going to tell you something
[45:22] saints you will never
[45:24] withstand the heat and the pressure that
[45:26] he is going to use
[45:27] if your heart is condemning you you will
[45:30] go mentally
[45:31] insane you will have an emotional
[45:33] breakdown
[45:35] you have got to leak as that song says
[45:37] you got to take it to the cross and
[45:38] leave it there
[45:40] you have got to allow him to deal with
[45:42] our wrinkles
[45:43] and quit questioning whether they're
[45:45] spots or not
[45:47] you have better get serious with him and
[45:49] deal with the heart issue
[45:51] once and for all and once you've dealt
[45:53] with that
[45:54] leave it alone allow him to use the heat
[45:57] and the pressure to deal with the
[45:59] wrinkles
[46:00] because that's what he's wanting to deal
[46:02] with
[46:03] brother branham says now faith is based
[46:06] on forgiveness then
[46:08] and then as we said this morning trying
[46:10] to get the church into the place where
[46:12] we could really see the apostolic times
[46:14] moving among us
[46:15] that's what we all hunger and it's just
[46:18] laying right at the door we see it we
[46:20] want to see more of it
[46:22] we want it in such a flow that it'll be
[46:24] a help
[46:25] to us us flow out to others
[46:28] remember jesus never used his power for
[46:31] himself
[46:32] he used it for others that's what it was
[46:34] sent for
[46:39] this is why it's so important
[46:42] that we deal with the spots of our life
[46:44] we let them go
[46:46] we allow god to use his heat and his
[46:48] pressure to deal with the wrinkles in
[46:49] our life
[46:51] because it may not really even be for
[46:53] your benefit
[46:56] this is a body move it's an individual
[47:00] walk
[47:01] yes but it is a body move
[47:04] and god is going to use your brothers
[47:07] and your sisters to iron out your
[47:09] wrinkles
[47:12] [Music]
[47:15] so this goes back to john 14. how can
[47:18] god use your brother and your sister to
[47:20] iron out your wrinkles when you saw them
[47:22] do
[47:23] xyz two weeks ago
[47:29] are they forgiven or are they not
[47:31] forgiven
[47:35] brother branham says faith is based on
[47:38] forgiveness
[47:42] that is forgiveness for you
[47:45] that is forgiveness for your brothers
[47:46] and your sisters because
[47:48] that is the very tools like it or don't
[47:51] like it
[47:52] it doesn't matter to god that is the
[47:56] tools that he
[47:57] is going to use to iron out your
[47:59] wrinkles
[48:01] he is not going to come down on a cloud
[48:03] as the fairy tale
[48:05] picture cloud you understand what i'm
[48:07] saying he's not going to float down on a
[48:09] cloud
[48:10] wave a little magic wand over you with a
[48:12] little
[48:14] nice iron and softly pat them out
[48:18] it's going to be the body that he has
[48:21] chose to come in
[48:22] it is going to be the form he has chose
[48:25] to come in
[48:27] we know what form that is saints we
[48:30] can't understand it
[48:32] it's a paradox yes but your brothers
[48:35] and your sisters and you are the form
[48:38] that god
[48:39] has chose to come in that is the form
[48:42] that he's going to use to iron out
[48:44] your wrinkles and my wrinkles his blood
[48:47] will take care of the spots i don't need
[48:49] you for my spots
[48:50] his blood will take care of my spots but
[48:53] there are things that are so
[48:55] ingrained i'm just being honest with you
[48:56] there are things that are so ingrained
[48:58] in my dna and my genetic makeup that i
[49:00] think they're right and everybody else
[49:02] is looking at them and be like
[49:04] that is so far left left field it's not
[49:06] even funny
[49:08] saints it's our genetics and our makeup
[49:11] the scripture says every man thinks in
[49:13] his own eyes thinks he's right
[49:16] it is going to take a brother and a
[49:18] sister who is honest with us
[49:20] to be able to identify that and bring
[49:22] that to our attention
[49:23] instead of getting angry about it we
[49:25] should be thankful
[49:27] if you've got a brother or a sister who
[49:29] will be honest
[49:30] with you you should be thankful get mad
[49:33] at him if
[49:34] if you want to for a little bit but at
[49:37] the end of the day
[49:38] you should be thankful that god has
[49:41] allowed a form to be on the face of the
[49:43] earth
[49:44] that will bring you into a perfect
[49:45] condition it's the form he's chosen to
[49:48] use saints
[49:51] allow him to use the form that he wants
[49:53] to
[49:56] that is the form that he will speak to
[49:57] us in that he will that he will
[49:59] bring to our understanding wrinkles that
[50:03] are in our makeup
[50:05] it's so important that we that we have
[50:07] faith in that
[50:09] and there's no way we can have faith in
[50:10] that if we don't believe that those
[50:12] people are forgiven
[50:13] if we don't believe that we are forgiven
[50:16] and forgiveness does not take a long
[50:17] time
[50:20] we're all well aware with the story
[50:22] about the little girl in the prayer line
[50:24] who smoked
[50:24] cigarettes she's in the prayer line
[50:27] she's a smoker
[50:28] she repents of it she stands before the
[50:31] prophet and he cannot see it
[50:33] that's how long it takes how long a time
[50:35] span you want to put on that i don't
[50:37] know i'm going to say maybe a nanosecond
[50:39] or less
[50:40] but it's a real quick process so now
[50:43] if the prophet tries to rebuke her for
[50:45] that he's telling god something that god
[50:47] has already forgot
[50:49] so now god thinks his prophets went
[50:50] insane because he's trying to tell him
[50:52] this little girl's got sin in her life
[50:53] and god has no idea about it
[50:56] that's how it works saints you'll not
[50:58] understand that
[50:59] but you have to accept it you have to
[51:02] accept it it's the only way
[51:03] as as the pressure in your and my
[51:07] individual walk increases it is the only
[51:10] way that you will keep a sane mind
[51:12] you have got to accept what he's done
[51:14] for you you have to accept it and you've
[51:16] got to leave it there
[51:18] and you have to accept that for your
[51:19] brothers and your sisters as well
[51:21] because god is going to use our brothers
[51:24] and sisters in a way
[51:25] moving forward and he has been but even
[51:27] more so moving forward
[51:30] to get the wrinkles out of each and
[51:31] every one of our lives we've got to have
[51:34] confidence in that process for ourselves
[51:35] and for our brothers and sisters
[51:39] brother branham says in the church age
[51:40] book we need to call on god for
[51:42] revelation more than anything else in
[51:44] the world
[51:45] very very familiar portion there
[51:48] but look at what he says after that
[51:52] we have accepted the bible we have
[51:53] accepted the great truths of it but it
[51:55] is still not real to most people because
[51:57] the revelation by the spirit is not
[51:59] there
[51:59] the word has not been quickened the
[52:02] bible says in second corinthians 5
[52:04] 21 that we have become the very
[52:06] righteousness of god
[52:07] by our union with jesus christ did
[52:10] you get it it's
[52:18] remember this is right this is the first
[52:21] thing he says right after he says we
[52:24] need to call on god for revelation more
[52:26] than anything
[52:27] the very first thing he goes to that we
[52:30] have been made the very
[52:32] righteousness of god by our union with
[52:34] jesus christ
[52:35] did you get it it says that we are the
[52:38] very righteousness of god himself
[52:41] by being in christ it says that
[52:44] he jesus became sin for us it does not
[52:47] say that he became
[52:48] sinful but became sin for us that by
[52:51] our union with him we might become the
[52:53] righteousness of god
[52:55] if we accept the fact and
[52:58] we must
[53:01] that with him i'm sorry that he
[53:05] literally became sin for
[53:08] us by his substitution for
[53:11] us then we must also accept the fact
[53:15] that we by our union with him
[53:18] have become the very righteousness of
[53:21] god
[53:24] listen what he says next to reject one
[53:27] is to reject the other
[53:30] to accept the one is to accept the other
[53:36] so it's not optional it is not optional
[53:41] if you are trying to accept the fact
[53:43] that i mean just the gospel in its
[53:46] rawest purest simplest that
[53:49] he became sin for me and was nailed to a
[53:53] cross
[53:54] and shed his blood for my salvation
[53:57] if you accept that fact you must also
[54:00] accept the fact that
[54:02] you are now spotless
[54:05] blameless wrinkle-free
[54:08] the very righteousness of god
[54:14] to reject that is to reject the fact
[54:17] that he died on the cross for you
[54:20] and i know that's just you know if we
[54:22] want to say
[54:24] christianity 101 but that is
[54:27] it in its raw form
[54:30] if we're going to accept one we have to
[54:33] accept the other
[54:34] if we reject the latter because of our
[54:36] dna makeup and how we just can't wrap
[54:39] our mind around that and how we failed
[54:41] you know 14 times two weeks ago
[54:46] to reject one is to reject the other
[54:49] and the reason that that is so important
[54:52] is if you can't accept
[54:54] one and you can't accept the other you
[54:56] will never
[54:57] accept the form that god has chose to
[54:59] come to you and i in in this day
[55:02] and you will never accept the form that
[55:05] he is
[55:05] using that he is trying to use
[55:09] to get the wrinkles out of our life to
[55:11] get us to perfection
[55:13] iron sharpeneth iron
[55:18] that is the form he's chose to use we
[55:22] have to have a we have to have a
[55:25] complete confidence
[55:27] in what the prophet says here if we're
[55:30] to move forward as he's wanting us to
[55:32] move forward
[55:33] to reject one is to reject the other
[55:38] 1961 revelation chapter five
[55:43] the first part of that series brother
[55:45] branham makes a statement
[55:48] he says and so many times we hunt for
[55:51] god
[55:51] and we look for god and if god was just
[55:55] everywhere and if he had a great big
[55:58] throne
[55:58] sitting up here somewhere everybody
[56:01] would believe in god then
[56:03] if god set up on a big throne here
[56:06] somewhere say
[56:07] he sits in this certain certain city and
[56:09] here he is
[56:10] this is god and you go to him he can
[56:13] just
[56:15] turn it like that why everybody
[56:18] would believe him this sounds like a
[56:21] wonderful thing to me
[56:25] this is what job was wanting remember
[56:28] this was job's prayer he says if there
[56:30] was just a
[56:31] man i could find if there was just a man
[56:33] in flesh if there was just a man
[56:34] somewhere if there was just some way i
[56:36] could contact him if i could just lay a
[56:37] hold of him
[56:38] if i could just tend to tangibly find
[56:40] him
[56:41] this is what job was after this is what
[56:43] job was looking for
[56:45] job just wanted to make direct contact
[56:48] with god
[56:51] brother braham says everybody would
[56:54] believe him
[56:56] then faith would be void
[56:59] so as wonderful as that would be and as
[57:03] much as i would like that it's
[57:06] impossible for god to grant that to us
[57:09] because that would not be pleasing to
[57:11] him because the scripture already says
[57:14] that without
[57:14] faith it's impossible to please god
[57:17] faith worketh by love
[57:19] faith is based on forgiveness faith
[57:22] cannot have a god setting right there on
[57:24] a throne that i can go to and he can
[57:25] snap his fingers and make everything
[57:27] work
[57:27] okay there's no faith involved
[57:31] and for this little hiccup that's in
[57:33] time
[57:34] that is what god is after he is after
[57:38] faith
[57:40] he is after faith that's what he's after
[57:44] he says we wouldn't have to have any
[57:46] faith at all then you see
[57:48] that would be that this is my favorite
[57:51] part of this quote
[57:52] that will be in the millennium
[57:56] praise the lord let's just stop reading
[57:59] there
[58:00] and let's get to the millennium but
[58:03] now he's calling and trying to find out
[58:07] those who
[58:10] it looks mysterious and dark
[58:13] and you don't know how to do it
[58:18] maybe i'm the only one in that condition
[58:20] maybe i'm the only one that's ever
[58:21] experienced
[58:22] that it's mysterious it's dark
[58:26] i've got no clue how to deal with this
[58:30] that's the people god's looking for
[58:35] but by faith we believe it we believe
[58:39] that's the reason this is
[58:43] so if you take that quote
[58:47] and you take that back to the scripture
[58:49] in ephesians
[58:52] is in ephesians 5 27 that he might
[58:55] present
[58:55] himself a glorious church
[58:58] not having spot or wrinkle amen
[59:04] how is he going to get a glorious church
[59:08] without spot or without wrinkle
[59:14] he's calling trying to find out
[59:18] it looks mysterious and it looks dark
[59:22] and you don't know how to do it
[59:27] but by faith we believe it
[59:32] that's how he's going to have a church
[59:33] that's without spot
[59:35] and without wrinkle is he's going to
[59:38] have a
[59:38] people that have a revelation of god's
[59:42] love to them
[59:43] that their faith will work by and they
[59:46] will
[59:46] understand and have a revelation of
[59:49] forgiveness
[59:50] for themselves and for their brothers
[59:53] and sisters
[59:55] that's how that's going to work that's
[59:57] how
[59:58] that we are going to be able to get rid
[1:00:01] of the weight
[1:00:02] of ourselves which is the weight that's
[1:00:05] holding us on this earth
[1:00:09] he's dealt with the sin problem we have
[1:00:12] got a full word
[1:00:14] and a full word brings deliverance for
[1:00:16] any kind of sin
[1:00:19] we have the word in its fullness
[1:00:22] we we have no excuses for sin we have
[1:00:25] the full word we believe the full word
[1:00:27] remember sin is just unbelief in the
[1:00:29] word if we believe the full word
[1:00:32] why should we question whether we have
[1:00:33] sin in our life or not
[1:00:35] it's not that we're not going to make
[1:00:36] mistakes repent of them
[1:00:39] wash the spots out let him deal with the
[1:00:41] wrinkles because
[1:00:42] that's what he's wanting to deal with
[1:00:44] and i think i've said it 100 times now
[1:00:46] but
[1:00:47] understand how he's going to deal with
[1:00:48] those wrinkles
[1:00:52] you don't get to pick how he deals with
[1:00:53] the wrinkles
[1:00:56] and unfortunately we don't get to pick
[1:00:58] how long the iron sets on there
[1:01:04] we don't get to pick
[1:01:07] he's the one with the iron in the hand
[1:01:10] he's the one that's going to move it
[1:01:11] back and forth
[1:01:12] he's the one that's going to decide how
[1:01:14] much pressure it needs on there
[1:01:18] the point that i'm saying that is i
[1:01:19] don't want you to beat yourself up or
[1:01:21] question where you stand with god when
[1:01:23] the heat and the pressure comes
[1:01:26] it's going to come it's not god being
[1:01:30] angry with you
[1:01:32] it is god simply wanting to iron out a
[1:01:36] wrinkle that you may or may not even
[1:01:38] know exists in your life
[1:01:40] you may not even know the wrinkle was
[1:01:42] there until everything's said and done
[1:01:43] with
[1:01:44] again look at what brother brandon says
[1:01:46] he says it looks mysterious
[1:01:47] it looks dark i cannot see what's going
[1:01:50] on here
[1:01:51] but i have to have faith
[1:01:54] in the one who has the iron in his hand
[1:01:58] i want to look at something real quick
[1:02:00] as we would come to a close
[1:02:03] we're very familiar in the scripture
[1:02:06] that god has seven compound names
[1:02:10] the seven compound names of jehovah and
[1:02:12] we know that the seven compound names of
[1:02:14] jehovah are found
[1:02:16] in jesus christ and we know that the
[1:02:19] fullness of the word coming in our day
[1:02:21] and our time
[1:02:22] was to manifest the fullness of jesus
[1:02:24] christ
[1:02:25] so therefore by default the fullness of
[1:02:28] the word being manifested in our day in
[1:02:31] our age
[1:02:31] is going to manifest the seven compound
[1:02:34] names of jehovah
[1:02:40] jehovah jireh the lord will provide a
[1:02:43] sacrifice
[1:02:46] i'm going to give a disclaimer before i
[1:02:47] go through these i'm probably not going
[1:02:49] to pronounce all of these correctly
[1:02:51] you can look them up yourself jehovah
[1:02:54] jireh
[1:02:55] the lord will provide a sacrifice
[1:02:58] do we want that manifested do you know
[1:03:02] what that means
[1:03:06] yeah it means you're at some point in
[1:03:09] time going to need a sacrifice
[1:03:12] that's not going to be a pleasant
[1:03:14] experience
[1:03:16] jehovah rapha the lord that healeth thee
[1:03:22] do we want the fullness of the word
[1:03:23] manifested do we want jesus christ on
[1:03:26] full display
[1:03:28] do you know what that means
[1:03:32] maybe i should have titled this sermon
[1:03:33] do you know what that means
[1:03:36] that means at some point in time you're
[1:03:38] going to need a healer
[1:03:41] do you want jesus manifested in his
[1:03:43] fullness
[1:03:46] jehovah shamma the lord is present
[1:03:53] do you know what that means
[1:03:58] that means most likely when you're
[1:04:00] getting some of those wrinkles ironed
[1:04:02] out
[1:04:03] you are going to get to the point you
[1:04:05] question where in the world is god
[1:04:09] is he even here
[1:04:15] do we want jesus christ fully manifested
[1:04:19] do we want jehovah shamma manifested
[1:04:24] jehovah shalom the lord is our peace
[1:04:32] you get my drift
[1:04:37] do we want it manifested
[1:04:40] are we opening the doors are we opening
[1:04:43] the windows
[1:04:45] do we really mean what we say
[1:04:48] remember his name which we took in
[1:04:52] baptism
[1:04:53] his name is his characteristics it's not
[1:04:56] just a verbalization
[1:04:59] david picked that up he's see david said
[1:05:02] let the words of my mouth
[1:05:04] and the meditation of my heart see you
[1:05:07] can be dunked in the pool however many
[1:05:08] times you want and jesus christ
[1:05:10] verbalized over you however many times
[1:05:11] you want
[1:05:15] but his name is his characteristics
[1:05:18] and if you've taken his name in baptism
[1:05:20] that's a public declaration
[1:05:22] that you want his name manifested
[1:05:25] through you do you know what that means
[1:05:31] jehovah nisi the lord is our banner
[1:05:37] that means you're going to be going into
[1:05:38] some wars
[1:05:41] and you're going to need him to fight
[1:05:43] those battles
[1:05:45] that's what that means do we want
[1:05:49] jehovah nisi manifested
[1:05:53] do we want it manifested in its fullness
[1:05:56] because you realize what that means is
[1:05:59] you can't fight that battle
[1:06:02] see most of us a lot of us myself
[1:06:04] included we're okay with the battles
[1:06:06] coming that we can handle
[1:06:09] that's the spots that's not what he's
[1:06:11] after
[1:06:13] what he's after is the wrinkles what
[1:06:15] he's after
[1:06:16] is the condition that you're going to be
[1:06:17] put in that you can't fight that battle
[1:06:20] anymore
[1:06:22] and now he has to manifest on your
[1:06:24] behalf
[1:06:27] nine of the ten battles you might have
[1:06:29] been able to fight just fine
[1:06:31] just because of the way you're made
[1:06:35] number 10 will totally destroy you if
[1:06:37] you try to if you try to rely on
[1:06:39] yourself
[1:06:41] you will come to the point that you need
[1:06:43] jehovah and easy
[1:06:47] jehovah reija the lord is my shepherd as
[1:06:50] the musicians come
[1:06:53] the lord is my shepherd oh that sounds
[1:06:55] so nice that's wonderful
[1:06:57] do you know what that means
[1:07:01] that means you are going to come to the
[1:07:03] point that you finally recognize you
[1:07:05] have
[1:07:06] absolutely zero ability to lead yourself
[1:07:13] do we want the fullness of the word
[1:07:14] manifested
[1:07:18] do we want the fullness of the word
[1:07:20] manifested
[1:07:24] jehovah tiscanu the lord is our
[1:07:27] righteousness
[1:07:32] that means at some point in time you're
[1:07:34] finally going to come to the recognition
[1:07:38] that everything that you've got to offer
[1:07:40] is nothing but filthy ranks
[1:07:46] we know that intellectually but do we
[1:07:48] really know it
[1:07:49] brother branham says we know the bible
[1:07:51] we've read the bible we know these
[1:07:53] things
[1:07:53] but the revelation of it is lacking
[1:07:57] god is going to make sure that the
[1:07:59] revelation of it is not lacking
[1:08:02] are we willing to allow him to do that
[1:08:06] do we want that fullness manifested
[1:08:13] do we know what that means to us as an
[1:08:15] individual
[1:08:16] do we really want to be free
[1:08:19] from the weight of ourself
[1:08:23] the paradox of that is we can set we can
[1:08:26] ask that question and we can say
[1:08:28] yes because we really don't even know
[1:08:31] what the weight of ourself
[1:08:32] is yet
[1:08:36] it's going to take conditions
[1:08:40] to bring that out do you understand what
[1:08:43] i mean
[1:08:45] we are undoubtedly each and every one
[1:08:47] i'll just speak for myself
[1:08:48] sitting here with conditions in our life
[1:08:51] that we
[1:08:52] that we're completely wrong in i mean
[1:08:54] completely
[1:08:56] messed up in completely wrong
[1:09:00] a situation will arise and we will
[1:09:02] handle it completely wrong
[1:09:04] and we'll be like why in the world did i
[1:09:06] do that
[1:09:08] but it'll be that condition that he will
[1:09:10] use
[1:09:11] to bring us to the recognition we still
[1:09:13] have a wrinkle there
[1:09:20] it's it's almost like a catch-22 we can
[1:09:23] ask that question and we can say yes
[1:09:24] amen that's what i want
[1:09:26] but when it comes
[1:09:29] when it comes as the as time is fading
[1:09:34] out and the
[1:09:35] heat and the pressure is so intense when
[1:09:37] it comes
[1:09:40] these seven compound names are going to
[1:09:42] start being manifested
[1:09:46] and that's not going to be none of these
[1:09:48] are pleasant conditions saints
[1:09:50] here i go with the doomsday preaching
[1:09:51] again sorry but
[1:09:53] none of these understand none of these
[1:09:55] are pleasant conditions
[1:09:58] but yet we have them laying in our life
[1:10:01] and and a lot of times we're completely
[1:10:04] ignorant to them until a condition
[1:10:05] arises that brings them out
[1:10:09] and that's what's forthcoming and that's
[1:10:12] what he's after
[1:10:14] and that's when we're really going to
[1:10:16] have to ask ourselves do we mean what we
[1:10:18] say
[1:10:19] do we really want the seventh seal
[1:10:22] revealed
[1:10:24] do we really want the fullness
[1:10:28] of god may manifest in
[1:10:31] my flesh
[1:10:36] it's a tough question it's going to be
[1:10:38] tough situations
[1:10:40] none of these are going to come with
[1:10:42] easy situations it's impossible
[1:10:46] these are tough situations these are
[1:10:48] characteristics
[1:10:50] that are only brought out
[1:10:53] under tough situations
[1:10:59] and i'll just want to leave you with
[1:11:00] this because this is
[1:11:03] this is really what i want to emphasize
[1:11:07] rebecca came before eliezer
[1:11:10] and she was a virgin and no man had
[1:11:14] known her
[1:11:16] just because things get tough just
[1:11:18] because things get hot
[1:11:20] just because things start squeezing just
[1:11:22] because it's an intense pressure
[1:11:25] that does not change the fact that you
[1:11:28] are the spotless
[1:11:30] virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ
[1:11:35] allow him to iron out the wrinkled
[1:11:37] saints that does not change your
[1:11:39] position with him
[1:11:41] allow him to do what he wants to do in
[1:11:44] the way that he chooses to do it
[1:11:47] and this is going to require faith
[1:11:53] to reject one is to reject the other
[1:11:57] to accept one is to accept the other
[1:12:03] let's just pray together precious lord
[1:12:06] jesus we just want to
[1:12:08] pause here to end this service lord
[1:12:14] and thank you for your word father
[1:12:17] thank you for your truth thank you for
[1:12:20] these things that you have laid in the
[1:12:22] scriptures and in the message for us
[1:12:25] that as we would come to the closing
[1:12:28] moments in time
[1:12:30] that we would have an understanding lord
[1:12:32] of what is going on around us
[1:12:35] and even more importantly what is going
[1:12:37] on within each and every one of us
[1:12:40] lord and as you have laid out these
[1:12:44] these requirements in your word for your
[1:12:47] bride to be
[1:12:48] spotless and to be blameless
[1:12:52] and to be wrinkle-free we recognize
[1:12:55] lord that there's no way we can meet
[1:12:58] those conditions
[1:13:00] but you would quickly come and you would
[1:13:02] lay another word in there
[1:13:04] that that i will be with you and even in
[1:13:07] you
[1:13:08] lord and it's to that that we look and
[1:13:11] it's to that
[1:13:12] that that our faith is in and our hope
[1:13:15] is in lord
[1:13:16] because we don't have any other option
[1:13:19] lord we recognize the seriousness of
[1:13:23] what you're wanting to do
[1:13:25] and what forms you're wanting it to do
[1:13:28] it in lord of hybrid flesh
[1:13:30] that that is not made to withstand the
[1:13:33] pressures that are coming
[1:13:35] not made to withstand the trials and the
[1:13:37] tribulations
[1:13:39] that not only are coming but that we're
[1:13:41] going through lord and that we have
[1:13:42] going through
[1:13:46] lord we are we are incapable
[1:13:51] and i think that's what you're wanting
[1:13:52] us to understand lord
[1:13:56] may we come and may we die afresh and
[1:13:59] may we
[1:14:00] may we remember the name
[1:14:03] that we took when we got buried in
[1:14:05] baptism
[1:14:06] before you lord and may we have a fresh
[1:14:10] understanding and a fresh recognition
[1:14:12] that we didn't just take that name
[1:14:15] verbally lord
[1:14:16] but we took that as the characteristics
[1:14:18] that you wish to display
[1:14:20] through our flesh and lord may we accept
[1:14:24] that
[1:14:24] and may we allow you even as confusing
[1:14:27] as a
[1:14:28] dark and mysterious as the situations
[1:14:30] may be
[1:14:31] may we allow you to manifest
[1:14:35] the fullness of your name in us
[1:14:39] lord for we we know that we have
[1:14:42] a promise once you do that lord and it's
[1:14:46] that promise just as jesus despised the
[1:14:49] cross but endured it for the promise
[1:14:51] that laid ahead
[1:14:52] it's that promise that we endure these
[1:14:55] things
[1:14:56] that we look forward to lord lord we
[1:14:59] look forward to that millennial reign
[1:15:01] lord
[1:15:02] once you have accomplished what you want
[1:15:04] to accomplish with us
[1:15:06] and we give ourselves completely over to
[1:15:09] that lord
[1:15:10] we pray that we would just take these
[1:15:12] words lord it's not been presented in a
[1:15:14] dynamic way lord
[1:15:16] i don't want to to fake dynamics
[1:15:19] or enthusiasm it's a serious thing lord
[1:15:22] but we pray that you would just take it
[1:15:25] and make it a reality to myself and to
[1:15:27] the people lord
[1:15:28] that we would manifest that which you
[1:15:30] desire
[1:15:31] we thank you for this time lord we pray
[1:15:34] your blessings on the people
[1:15:36] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:15:40] god bless you brother
[1:15:43] go ahead brother
[1:16:00] you are more
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:18] me
[1:16:32] is
[1:16:34] set free
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:14] me
[1:17:18] who are you
[1:17:30] amen let's all stand
[1:17:33] i just want to say god is the master at
[1:17:36] doing heart surgery
[1:17:40] and then i marvel and when i watch god
[1:17:44] work what i see
[1:17:47] you know we talked about preeminence
[1:17:50] and we talk about the second fold of the
[1:17:52] great threefold plan of god and that
[1:17:54] second poll was to have preeminence in a
[1:17:56] people
[1:17:56] and he's doing that now but that means
[1:17:58] he wants to have preeminence in me
[1:18:00] and preeminence means absolute control
[1:18:04] absolute total control and that's what
[1:18:06] god's doing he's working it all out
[1:18:08] to where he gets absolute total control
[1:18:11] that we don't just have
[1:18:12] a knee-jerk reaction and do what we've
[1:18:14] always done but that he
[1:18:15] takes control and does what he wants in
[1:18:18] every situation
[1:18:19] and then he's perfecting his bride he's
[1:18:22] using all the circumstances around us to
[1:18:24] perfect his bride
[1:18:25] but i say god have your perfect way in
[1:18:27] me amen
[1:18:28] i i'm i'm tired of myself amen
[1:18:32] i'm tired of the weight of myself amen
[1:18:34] and i just
[1:18:35] if if i just had a switch where i could
[1:18:37] just flip it off
[1:18:38] i would take the switch and i'd flip it
[1:18:40] off but god hasn't made it that way he
[1:18:42] wants it under his control
[1:18:44] and i say praise god we've come to this
[1:18:47] life
[1:18:48] for training we've come here training
[1:18:51] for reigning we've come here to learn
[1:18:52] about god we've come here to
[1:18:54] understand what the seven redemptive
[1:18:56] names of god are all about
[1:18:58] amen because we would experience it in
[1:19:00] the negative to watch god come through
[1:19:02] on the positive
[1:19:03] i say praise be to god then when he was
[1:19:07] talking about the nature i started
[1:19:08] thinking
[1:19:09] that that quote we hear so many times
[1:19:11] your greatest strength is also your
[1:19:12] greatest weakness
[1:19:14] and i was thinking while he was while he
[1:19:16] was ministering there
[1:19:18] about a police dog a police dog
[1:19:22] is aggressive right do you want
[1:19:25] an aggressive dog as a police are you
[1:19:26] going to take down a criminal he's got
[1:19:28] to be aggressive he's got to have
[1:19:29] grit he's got to have determination he's
[1:19:31] got to be a little bit ferocious
[1:19:34] and you breed that into the nature
[1:19:35] because you want that nature because
[1:19:37] he's gonna face down a criminal
[1:19:39] and have to bring it down amen and
[1:19:41] that's a wonderful thing they bred it to
[1:19:43] get it that way
[1:19:44] amen but they don't want that police dog
[1:19:46] dragging down little old ladies and
[1:19:48] little kids and
[1:19:50] you understand i mean we the that
[1:19:53] trainer wants a certain thing in that
[1:19:55] dog
[1:19:55] but he wants that under absolute
[1:19:58] complete control
[1:19:59] because he well there's got to be a mind
[1:20:01] a greater mind that can discern a
[1:20:03] situation
[1:20:04] that can bring that nature under control
[1:20:06] so it's only used the right way
[1:20:08] and god has put so many ingredients in
[1:20:10] us to get us a certain way
[1:20:12] amen bread it into us amen but that
[1:20:15] thing without control can be the very
[1:20:16] thing that'll destroy
[1:20:18] everything around us it'll destroy
[1:20:20] situations and destroy
[1:20:21] relationships and the very thing that
[1:20:23] god wants to use for his glory
[1:20:25] can absolutely be destructive if we're
[1:20:27] not in absolute control of the holy
[1:20:29] ghost
[1:20:31] and so there's times that he'll let us
[1:20:32] go ruin something
[1:20:34] just so we'll end up hating everything
[1:20:36] about us and saying god you've got to
[1:20:38] take control of us
[1:20:40] i don't know what i don't know what to
[1:20:42] do i don't know which end is up
[1:20:44] i don't know what to do without your
[1:20:45] leadership how many of you can say god i
[1:20:48] want you to have control of me
[1:20:51] i want you to i want to know when you
[1:20:53] say go i want to go when you say stop i
[1:20:55] want to stop
[1:20:56] i want you to have control of me amen
[1:21:00] i think that's what preeminence is all
[1:21:01] about
[1:21:03] just appreciate the word i appreciate
[1:21:05] the sincerity i appreciate the depth of
[1:21:07] an
[1:21:07] individual walk where god will come down
[1:21:10] and start dealing with this individually
[1:21:12] when nobody else around us will
[1:21:14] understand what we're going through and
[1:21:15] understand what god's teaching us
[1:21:17] because the lesson isn't for them it's
[1:21:18] only for me
[1:21:20] and if i try to explain it won't even
[1:21:22] make sense to you because what god is
[1:21:24] doing is working something out at me
[1:21:26] and i know exactly what he's doing and i
[1:21:28] can't even get anybody else to
[1:21:29] understand it
[1:21:30] that's how personal this is becoming i
[1:21:32] say thank you lord
[1:21:34] for dealing with me as an individual i
[1:21:37] want to go back and i just jotted down a
[1:21:39] note is something that i found
[1:21:40] interesting
[1:21:41] back early on when he talked about
[1:21:43] eliezer's prayer how it was a selfless
[1:21:45] prayer
[1:21:45] and he was praying for somebody else and
[1:21:47] how god answered that before he was even
[1:21:49] done praying she was on the scene
[1:21:51] and it just reminded me of a testimony
[1:21:53] that i just saw just
[1:21:54] i think just two days ago i was watching
[1:21:57] uh brother billy paul's testimony
[1:21:59] and in brother billy paul's testimony he
[1:22:01] was talking about they were out camping
[1:22:03] and brother billy had been really
[1:22:05] nervous and he was having
[1:22:06] he was nervous he was struggling with
[1:22:08] his nerves from the meetings
[1:22:10] and they were out grilling some steaks
[1:22:12] and brother branham knew that he was
[1:22:13] nervous
[1:22:14] and he took his hat off just for a
[1:22:15] second and prayed and he put his hat
[1:22:17] back on and billy noticed him doing it
[1:22:19] and billy said he ate his meal he felt
[1:22:22] good and after the meal was over they
[1:22:24] were sitting around talking and brother
[1:22:25] branham said
[1:22:26] now you all know billy's been real
[1:22:27] nervous he was nervous when he got here
[1:22:29] to cam
[1:22:30] and he says before we ate i just prayed
[1:22:33] a little prayer and asked god
[1:22:35] lord would you bless billy and help him
[1:22:36] to enjoy his meal enjoy his time here
[1:22:39] and that nervousness he says you saw
[1:22:40] what a big meal he ate
[1:22:42] and brother billy said it went he was he
[1:22:44] enjoyed himself
[1:22:46] he said then brother branham pulled up
[1:22:48] took off his boot took off his sock and
[1:22:50] pulled up his pants and showed a great
[1:22:52] big black and blue
[1:22:53] swollen ankle he said a week ago or more
[1:22:56] than that he said i sprained my ankle
[1:22:57] real bad
[1:22:58] and i've prayed for it every night since
[1:23:00] then and it hasn't got healed
[1:23:03] and he says see that gift is not for me
[1:23:05] it's for others
[1:23:07] i thought what a testimony here the
[1:23:10] prophet
[1:23:10] i mean you've been there where you've
[1:23:12] prayed day after day deliver me deliver
[1:23:14] me deliver me and nothing moves
[1:23:16] but brother branham couldn't doubt the
[1:23:18] gift he couldn't doubt his
[1:23:20] who he was in christ he couldn't doubt
[1:23:22] his salvation he couldn't doubt that he
[1:23:24] had a gift of healing for the nation's
[1:23:26] peoples of the world he couldn't doubt
[1:23:27] his commission he couldn't down anything
[1:23:29] even though it wasn't working on him he
[1:23:32] was being tested to have faith
[1:23:33] it was still a gift for others amen
[1:23:37] maybe sometimes what we need to do is
[1:23:39] quit focusing on us
[1:23:42] amen quit worrying about what we're
[1:23:44] going through and just start praying for
[1:23:45] somebody else
[1:23:46] and if that other person will start
[1:23:47] praying for us maybe the gifts are here
[1:23:50] for one another
[1:23:51] just let it crisscross all over the
[1:23:53] building all over the body of christ
[1:23:55] amen i'll pray for you and you pray for
