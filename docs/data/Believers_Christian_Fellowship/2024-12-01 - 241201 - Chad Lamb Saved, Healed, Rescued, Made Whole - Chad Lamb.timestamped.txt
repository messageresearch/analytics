[13:08] thank our brother Jim for amen you talk
[13:10] about getting out of the way the brother
[13:11] just yielded himself and God took over
[13:13] and we appreciated appreciated the word
[13:16] I've I've been thinking on it quite a
[13:17] bit and so while he was preaching I
[13:20] jotted down a couple notes and uh on my
[13:22] paper and that's the the thoughts that
[13:24] I'm going to bring today so we just pray
[13:26] that the Lord has his way let's read a
[13:29] Ephesians chapter 2 and let's go to
[13:31] verse
[13:35] 8 for by grace are you saved through
[13:38] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[13:41] the gift of God Amen God bless you as
[13:43] you take your
[13:45] seats praise the
[13:48] Lord amen I just want to thank everybody
[13:50] who was able to make it down for the
[13:52] visitation for the bird family and all
[13:54] that you were able to do for them it's
[13:56] quite a blessing to see several of you
[13:58] down there and I know it's been a hard
[14:00] time this holiday for some in our midst
[14:02] uh having losses but we just pray that
[14:04] God will comfort and bless all of
[14:07] them amen as we as we look into this
[14:11] word I wanted to take the word here
[14:14] saved for by grace are you saved through
[14:17] faith and that un of yourselves is the
[14:18] gift of God and I wanted to pull out the
[14:20] word saved and take a look at it I
[14:22] mentioned this I don't know several
[14:24] months ago when I was preaching we
[14:26] talked about this but this word saved is
[14:29] a Greek word and the Greek word is soo s
[14:32] o Zoo Soo and um and I just wanted to
[14:37] minister on it it's something that if
[14:39] we've been if you've been in Christian
[14:40] circles all of your life or part of your
[14:43] life you hear saved you know we're saved
[14:45] we've been saved are they saved and we
[14:47] use this term over and over and over
[14:49] again but I wanted to look through the
[14:51] Bible and I just wanted to take a look
[14:53] and do a maybe a little bit of a word
[14:55] study on it because it became amazing to
[14:57] me the more I looked at it cuz I really
[14:59] want to understand it we realize that we
[15:01] live in the day and age where the
[15:02] Prophet has come and showed us that
[15:04] we've had traditional understanding of
[15:06] things and maybe the traditional
[15:08] understanding wasn't right amen that
[15:10] right that that man added his own
[15:11] interpretation or own understanding and
[15:14] maybe even so our own way of believing
[15:16] in what salvation is what does it mean
[15:18] to be saved or what is saved and and
[15:20] there's very much a traditional uh
[15:22] Church understanding of that but there's
[15:24] a Biblical teaching amen and we want to
[15:26] look through the Bible so keep your
[15:28] Bibles hand I want to read quite a few
[15:30] scriptures amen this word Soo is used in
[15:33] the New Testament 111 times and we won't
[15:36] read all of them today but I went
[15:39] through all of them just to try to get a
[15:40] picture of what God is showing us and
[15:44] and when you get to the
[15:46] definition uh when you get to the
[15:48] definition of the word in the
[15:50] concordance it says to save keep safe
[15:53] and sound to rescue from danger or
[15:57] destruction it also is to save one from
[16:00] injury or Peril to save a suffering one
[16:03] from perishing one's suffering from
[16:06] disease to make well to heal restore to
[16:10] health to preserve one who is in danger
[16:12] of Destruction to save or rescue so this
[16:15] is the word Soo this is what it means to
[16:17] save and it's not just limited to
[16:20] Salvation from Eternal damnation that's
[16:22] also part of it but it's much more
[16:24] encompassing than that so for a title I
[16:27] just want to pull out of there some of
[16:28] of the words uh out of the definition
[16:31] and I want to preach on Saved healed
[16:34] rescued made
[16:36] whole saved healed rescued made whole
[16:41] amen maybe we can get a a full picture
[16:44] of what God has done for us that's right
[16:46] this way let's go to Matthew 18 together
[16:59] Matthew
[17:00] 18 verse 11 and in no way am I am I
[17:05] preaching a conclusive message and all
[17:06] that this word means and I don't know we
[17:08] we'll learn more as time goes on God is
[17:10] constantly opening up more and more
[17:12] Revelation but I just want to share the
[17:14] things that have been opening up for me
[17:16] so we found in Ephesians 2:8 we just
[17:18] read for Your Grace by grace are you
[17:21] saved so we know our Salvation is by
[17:23] Grace God's grace but it's through faith
[17:27] and that not of yourselves is the gift
[17:29] of God that's important I want you to
[17:31] remember that now we know it so well so
[17:33] you will I know you'll remember it but
[17:34] remember it as a foundation for what
[17:36] we're talking about for by grace are you
[17:38] saved amen through faith and that not of
[17:41] yourselves it is a gift of God so this
[17:43] salvation is is not is not based on what
[17:46] we do it's based on what God has done
[17:49] but what God has done amen brings a
[17:52] response out of us and the response also
[17:54] is
[17:55] God through faith and that not of
[17:57] yourselves it is a gift of of God and
[17:59] that's what we're going to see as we go
[18:01] on now let's look at Matthew
[18:06] 1811 for the son of man has come to save
[18:10] that which was
[18:11] lost the son of man has come to save
[18:14] this is the same word save that which
[18:16] was lost this word lost is that which is
[18:18] in Peril or destroyed or or or uh uh
[18:22] damaged amen not just something that
[18:25] that's not found but this is something
[18:26] that's lost that's in Peril of
[18:28] destruction he came to save that which
[18:31] was going to be destroyed amen and that
[18:33] was Us by the grace of God he came let's
[18:37] go back to Matthew 9 now we're going to
[18:39] turn to a lot of the scriptures here in
[18:41] the New Testament and the gospels
[18:43] especially but I've tried to couple them
[18:45] together so we can just flip a few pages
[18:47] at a time and stay in the same general
[18:49] area in the Bible but I really wanted to
[18:51] go through the scriptures and take a
[18:53] look at this now remember our word saved
[18:56] here uh that we just looked at in these
[18:58] two scriptures is the Greek word Soo and
[19:00] so when I come to this word in the Bible
[19:03] it'll be translated differently we're
[19:05] going to read it and it won't say saved
[19:07] but when we get to it I'll tell you Soo
[19:08] so you know this is the same Greek word
[19:10] as the word saved in Ephesians 2 and
[19:13] saved here in Matthew so let's look here
[19:16] at uh uh Matthew
[19:20] 9:19 and Jesus arose and followed him
[19:23] and so did his disciples and behold a
[19:25] woman a woman which was diseased with an
[19:27] issue of blood 12 years came behind him
[19:30] and touched the him of His Garment for
[19:32] she said within herself if I may but
[19:34] touch His Garment I shall be made whole
[19:40] Soo saved amen amen amen it's
[19:45] beautiful but Jesus turned him about and
[19:48] when he saw her he said daughter be of
[19:50] good Comfort thy faith ha made thee
[19:52] whole Soo and the woman was made whole
[19:56] Soo from that hour amen amen so the
[20:01] woman was in destruction amen she was in
[20:04] a a a situation where she had a blood
[20:06] issue for 12 years amen and she amen by
[20:10] her faith in Jesus Christ amen which was
[20:13] the present tense manifestation of of
[20:15] God Amen when she said within herself
[20:18] amen if I can but touch the him of His
[20:20] Garment this is a personal revelation to
[20:22] her she knew somehow within herself no
[20:25] priest told her she didn't read it in
[20:27] the book but within she had a revelation
[20:30] if I can touch him the Hemm of His
[20:33] Garment I'll be made every bit whole I
[20:35] will be saved amen saved from my
[20:37] condition I'll be restored back to
[20:39] health why because I believe that
[20:42] there's something about him that if I
[20:43] can touch him amen I can be made whole
[20:47] and Jesus turned around and said
[20:49] daughter be of good Comfort now listen
[20:51] to the words thy faith ha made thee
[20:55] whole he says thy faith has made thee
[20:57] whole
[20:59] oh it's so good
[21:01] friends thy faith listen where did she
[21:04] get the faith to believe it was a
[21:06] revelation that came to her amen the
[21:09] faith was a gift from God but it was
[21:11] found in her yeah so Jesus looks at her
[21:14] and says thy faith not what you heard
[21:16] somebody else say not what somebody
[21:18] taught you not what you're repeating out
[21:20] of a book not what you consciously are
[21:22] aware of and can reverberate but thy
[21:24] faith the faith that is locked inside of
[21:26] you has saved you
[21:29] what kind of Faith was that amen I
[21:31] believe according to Ephesians 2:8 that
[21:34] it was a gift of God it was the faith as
[21:37] we heard Wednesday night it was the
[21:38] faith that God gives or the faith of God
[21:41] or The Faith from God but God attributes
[21:44] that this is something that was in you
[21:47] so he calls it your
[21:50] faith even though we know it's God's
[21:52] faith amen it takes the faith that God
[21:54] gives to believe this way it's God's
[21:56] faith but it's in her
[22:01] yeah remember how brother B taught us
[22:04] amen the woman at the well the woman at
[22:06] the well amen she was a seed brother B
[22:08] said she was a thought that fell from
[22:10] the mind of God she was trapped in a
[22:13] lost condition in destruction amen her
[22:17] life was a a a wreck amen but but here
[22:20] comes Jesus because he had to go by
[22:22] Samaria because he wanted to save that
[22:24] which was lost he wanted to heal that
[22:26] which was in destruction he wanted to to
[22:28] make her whole and rescue her from her
[22:30] situation so he come by her way and
[22:33] started a conversation with her amen now
[22:36] listen Jesus never just came and plucked
[22:39] her up and rescued
[22:41] her what he did was present himself to
[22:44] her and when she had something within
[22:46] her to believe him amen she was
[22:49] saved
[22:52] amen this is so
[22:55] good they're so good friends he comes
[22:58] there she was a thought that fell from
[22:59] the mind of God Amen brother B said she
[23:02] had representation in heaven brother B
[23:04] also said she had something to believe
[23:06] with amen and the difference between her
[23:08] and the Pharisees they could see the
[23:10] same Jesus they could hear some of the
[23:12] same statements they could see the same
[23:14] discernment amen but there was she was a
[23:17] thought that fell from the mind of God
[23:19] she had representation in heaven and she
[23:22] had something in her to believe with she
[23:24] had the faith that was a gift of God and
[23:26] when she was presented with the Jesus of
[23:29] her day there was something in her that
[23:31] could believe hey I know when Messiah
[23:34] cometh he'll do these things when the
[23:36] Pharisees were saying be elub she was
[23:39] saying this is the
[23:44] Messiah you know what she was
[23:47] saved
[23:50] healed amen let's go to the Book of Mark
[24:01] let's go to
[24:04] Mark chapter
[24:15] 5 Mark chapter 5 and let's go to verse
[24:23] 21 and when Jesus was passed over again
[24:26] by ship unto the other side which
[24:28] much people gathered unto him and he was
[24:30] nigh unto the sea and behold there came
[24:33] one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus
[24:36] by name and when he saw him he fell at
[24:38] his feet and besought him greatly saying
[24:40] my little daughter lith at the point of
[24:42] death I pray thee come and lay thy hands
[24:45] on her that she may be healed and she
[24:48] shall live and Jes Jesus went unto him
[24:51] and much people followed him and
[24:53] thronged him so I want to read read
[24:55] verse 23 again and Bes saw him greatly
[24:57] saying my little layeth at the point of
[24:59] death I pray thee come and lay thy hands
[25:01] on her that she may be healed
[25:04] Soo same word is saved amen so we
[25:08] understand what salvation is it's more
[25:11] listen to me it's more than just a
[25:13] traditional idea if I fold my hands a
[25:16] certain way and I say a certain thing
[25:18] and I claim to believe in something that
[25:20] happened 2,000 years ago then all of a
[25:22] sudden someday I'll be okay it's more
[25:24] than that friends it's an absolute
[25:26] rescue it's a it's a making whole it's a
[25:28] healing it's a delivering it's something
[25:31] that's going on right now and something
[25:33] that will continue to go on into the
[25:35] future it's more than just something
[25:37] happened and something will happen and
[25:38] if I follow this formula I'll be part of
[25:41] it it's not a formula it's not a certain
[25:43] prayer it's not a church tradition it's
[25:45] not a historical thing it's a present
[25:47] tense there's a Salvation available
[25:49] because there's a Christ available today
[25:53] amen and what's he trying to do he's
[25:55] trying to restore he's trying to make
[25:57] whole he's trying to heal he's trying to
[26:01] save amen let's go to Mark
[26:05] 6 verse 56 6 and
[26:13] 56 Mark 6:56 and whether soever he
[26:17] entered into the villages or cities or
[26:19] country they laid the sick in the
[26:21] streets and besought him that they might
[26:22] touch if it were but the border of His
[26:25] Garment and as many as touched him were
[26:27] made whole Soo amen amen
[26:33] amen I believe we can still touch him
[26:36] amen and be made
[26:39] whole Mark chapter 10 let's turn over to
[26:41] Mark chapter
[26:47] 10 verse 51 and
[26:50] 52 Mark chapter 10 verse
[26:54] 51 this says when they uh bring blind
[26:57] bmus to Jes Jesus 51 uh he says and
[27:02] Jesus answered and said unto him what
[27:03] wil thou that I shall do unto thee the
[27:06] blind man said unto him Lord that I
[27:08] might receive my sight and Jesus said
[27:10] unto him go thy way thy faith ha made
[27:13] thee whole and immediately he received
[27:15] his sight and followed Jesus in the way
[27:19] thy faith ha made thee whole
[27:22] Soo thy faith save
[27:24] thee amen and I love what Jesus says
[27:27] again go th way thy
[27:30] faith amen listen we we know in all of
[27:33] these instances that Jesus had plenty of
[27:36] Faith but it was all it was not based on
[27:39] Jesus's faith it was based on the faith
[27:41] that was found in those that were
[27:43] reaching out to him and calling out to
[27:46] him amen and so Jesus had plenty of
[27:48] faith when he went to his hometown when
[27:50] he went back to capernium he had plenty
[27:52] of Faith but he said there he could do
[27:54] not many miracles because of their
[27:57] unbelief so he couldn't heal them and
[27:59] deliver them and save them because they
[28:02] didn't
[28:04] believe
[28:05] amen and so he says Thy Thy faith has
[28:10] saved saved thee made thee whole let's
[28:12] go to Mark 15
[28:15] now I'm just grabbing a
[28:18] sampling of some of these
[28:21] things Mark 15 verse 29 Mark 15 and 29
[28:26] this is at the crucifixion of Jesus
[28:27] Christ Christ and they that passed by
[28:30] railed on him waging their heads saying
[28:32] oh that thou uh oh a ah thou that
[28:37] destroyest the temple and buildest it in
[28:38] three days save thyself save Soo thyself
[28:42] and come down from the cross likewise
[28:44] also the chief priest mock said among
[28:46] themselves with the scribes he saved Soo
[28:49] others himself he cannot save
[28:52] Soo so this is the same same word and it
[28:55] means this is actually a saving from
[28:58] destruction now of saving from death but
[29:00] it's the same word with the same meaning
[29:03] let's go to ma Mark 16 sorry Mark 16:5
[29:10] now and he said unto them go you into
[29:13] all the world and preach the gospel to
[29:15] Every Creature he that believeth and is
[29:18] baptized shall be saved
[29:21] Soo and he that believeth not shall be
[29:26] damned so it's look at it again he that
[29:30] believeth and is baptized shall be
[29:34] saved but he that believeth
[29:36] not so here once again they have to
[29:41] believe if they don't believe they won't
[29:44] be saved rescued made whole restored it
[29:47] won't be it's based off faith and that
[29:51] is a gift of God let's go to Luke
[29:53] Chapter 7
[30:06] let's go to Luke chapter
[30:09] 7 yeah let's go to verse
[30:12] 44 Luke 7:
[30:15] 44 and he turned to the woman and said
[30:18] unto Simon seest thou this woman I
[30:21] entered into thine house thou gavest me
[30:23] no water from my feet but sheath washed
[30:25] my feet with her tears and wiped them
[30:27] with her hairs of her head thou gavest
[30:29] me no kiss but this woman since the time
[30:32] I came in hath not ceased to kiss my
[30:34] feet my head with oil thou D not anoint
[30:37] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[30:39] with ointment wherefore I say unto thee
[30:41] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[30:43] she loved much but whom little Is
[30:46] Forgiven the same loveth little and he
[30:48] said unto her thy sins are forgiven and
[30:52] they that sat at meat with him began to
[30:54] say within themselves who is this that
[30:56] forgiveth sins and he said to the woman
[30:58] thy faith has saved thee go in
[31:02] peace amen thy faith had she he looked
[31:06] right at her and said thy faith yeah but
[31:09] we know according to Ephesians 2:8 that
[31:12] it's the faith of God we know that it's
[31:15] the gift of God the gift of God to be
[31:17] able to believe that's why this little
[31:19] Harlot this prostitute woman could run
[31:21] in there to Simon's house to a place
[31:23] where she was not welcome amen amongst
[31:25] company where she was not desired but
[31:27] she could weave her way in and make her
[31:29] way and pour out amen this fragrance and
[31:31] ointment and wash his feet amen because
[31:33] she had something to believe with she
[31:35] must have been one of them other
[31:37] thoughts that fell from the mind of God
[31:40] it was here on Earth and and now amen
[31:43] she had something to believe with
[31:45] because she had representation in heaven
[31:47] and when she came in contact with the
[31:49] living word for her day there was
[31:51] something in her that could recognize
[31:53] amen and and I don't even know what she
[31:55] recognized I don't know I mean I don't
[31:57] know how full the Revelation was all
[31:59] that she knew was something stirred her
[32:01] ha and she had to get to him and she
[32:03] couldn't leave him in that condition and
[32:04] there was something stirring in her that
[32:06] wasn't stirring in Simon wasn't stirring
[32:09] in all the guests in that house that day
[32:11] but it was stirring in that little woman
[32:13] amen and that was something that had to
[32:14] come from God Amen it wasn't something
[32:17] uh that was just human down through the
[32:19] the the human sphere it was a gift of
[32:21] God to believe that this man sitting
[32:24] right here amen was God and worthy to be
[32:26] worshiped and worthy to give your die
[32:28] for and worthy to give up all your money
[32:29] for and worthy to Bear reproach for and
[32:32] worthy to take the dirt off his feet
[32:34] onto your own hair and worthy to kiss
[32:36] and worthy to be shamed and
[32:38] mocked what was that that was more than
[32:41] human friend that was something that
[32:43] come from God but because it abided in
[32:45] her amen it wasn't somebody said go wash
[32:47] his
[32:48] feet it was something within her Jesus
[32:51] looked at her and said thy faith
[32:55] yeah thy faith has saved thee
[33:00] Soo thy faith hath saved thee go in
[33:05] peace man that woman was
[33:08] restored that woman was saved by what by
[33:13] her
[33:14] faith a amen it was such a difference
[33:18] between her like we said and Simon
[33:21] because Simon didn't have anything to
[33:22] believe with Simon's the one who should
[33:23] have believed Simon had the education he
[33:27] had the teach teaching he had the
[33:28] connections he knew what was going on he
[33:31] knew what the Miracles were he had had
[33:33] heard about the signs he had caught the
[33:35] he was right in the mix of all of it
[33:37] amen and he had the education he had
[33:39] access to the Old Testament prophecies
[33:41] he could read and he was educated and
[33:43] he's the one who should have known amen
[33:45] but it wasn't in him to know it was in
[33:47] her to know and she was saved because
[33:49] there was something in her that could
[33:56] believe and what was it that she could
[34:00] believe she could believe something that
[34:02] Simon and the Pharisees and the
[34:04] religious leaders couldn't
[34:07] believe because they could believe all
[34:09] that God had
[34:11] done right that's it amen they could
[34:13] believe in Moses and The Parting of the
[34:16] Red Sea and the Deliverance out of Egypt
[34:17] and they could believe in the prophet
[34:19] and they could believe in Jeremiah they
[34:20] could believe in the dispersion and they
[34:22] could believe in the
[34:23] regathering they could believe in
[34:25] everything that God done but what could
[34:27] could she believe what saved her amen
[34:29] she was saved because she could believe
[34:31] the word that was manifest right before
[34:33] her eyes and that's what nobody else
[34:36] could recognize but her and zakus and
[34:39] the disciples and fishermen and tax
[34:41] collectors and prostitutes and all of
[34:43] them they had something within them that
[34:45] could recognize and when they could
[34:47] recognize this is God Amen they were
[34:50] saved healed restored rescued amen
[34:54] delivered all of that why because they
[34:56] could believe in a present tense God
[35:00] they were amongst people who believed
[35:01] and read and were educated and they knew
[35:04] the historical God but they didn't know
[35:06] the I am God they knew that I am when he
[35:10] was and they said that was God that was
[35:12] the I am then when I am comes in flesh
[35:14] they don't recognize him as God they
[35:16] call him be
[35:23] elub he never said Simon you're
[35:26] saved right because you believe
[35:28] everything that I did right and you
[35:30] believe all the Torah
[35:41] yeah see the gospel is the good
[35:46] news and it's always the current good
[35:49] news amen and it's always been hard to
[35:53] believe right right to the intellectual
[35:57] mind
[35:59] the day listen the
[36:02] the a good portion of the world believes
[36:05] that there was a man named Jesus Christ
[36:07] who was the son of God who died for the
[36:09] sins of the world a good portion
[36:12] billions I think believe that and
[36:15] confess that and have no problem
[36:17] believing that's
[36:19] true but the day he was here that was
[36:21] the hardest thing in the world to
[36:23] believe that only a tiny Remnant
[36:26] believed it in the day that it was being
[36:28] made manifest and only those that had
[36:30] representation in heaven were able to
[36:32] believe
[36:35] it amen brother brandham said the
[36:37] Pharisees did not have representation in
[36:40] heaven she did so it doesn't take
[36:43] representation in heaven to believe the
[36:45] historical gospel amen that's right it
[36:49] takes representation in heaven in being
[36:51] a thought of God to believe the present
[36:53] tense
[36:55] gospel and that's the way it's all
[36:57] always been through the Bible always I
[36:59] say this over and over and over and over
[37:01] and over and over but Salvation has
[37:03] never changed from Genesis to Revelation
[37:06] salvation from day one all the way
[37:08] through has always been based on
[37:11] believing the word for your day always
[37:14] in every generation in every cycle of
[37:17] the Bible you go back and read it
[37:19] salvation is always based on believing
[37:21] the word when it's presented to you yeah
[37:25] amen amen and and it's always been hard
[37:28] to
[37:29] believe it was hard to believe that a
[37:32] farmer named Noah was given the rescue
[37:34] plan for the whole world it's hard to
[37:38] believe a common man amen was called to
[37:40] be a prophet of God and God spoke to him
[37:42] and told him and things were going to
[37:44] happen that had never happened he said
[37:45] there's going to be rain there's going
[37:46] to be a delug there's going to be a
[37:47] flood and they had never known rain they
[37:50] had never felt raindrops fall on their
[37:52] skin Amen in fact brother R tells us in
[37:54] their scientific achievement in their
[37:56] Advanced civilization they could check
[37:58] and they could find no moisture no
[38:00] nothing amen because they didn't know
[38:02] amen that they were going to destroy
[38:03] themselves with an atomic bomb and knock
[38:05] the Earth off its axis and create
[38:07] condensation but God knew it amen and
[38:10] God could tell an unlikely individual
[38:14] yeah who just happened to have something
[38:17] in them that would
[38:19] [Music]
[38:21] believe and what he
[38:24] believed became his salvation yeah
[38:28] amen his faith is what saved him what
[38:32] saved Noah his faith how because his
[38:35] faith went into action and he built the
[38:37] boat according to what God Said and by
[38:41] faith Noah was
[38:45] saved oh praise God this is the way it's
[38:49] always
[38:50] been it's always been something within
[38:54] the children of God that when God MO
[38:57] moves they recognize it they recognize
[39:00] it with something more than int
[39:01] intelligence they recognize it with more
[39:04] than something than intellect they
[39:05] recognize it not because somebody told
[39:07] them this is it they recognize it
[39:08] because they believe it there's
[39:10] something in them to
[39:14] believe
[39:16] amen and so and that
[39:20] faith that Faith becomes their
[39:23] salvation which is their healing yes
[39:26] which is their rescue which is their
[39:28] restoration which makes them whole
[39:31] again
[39:34] amen oh my
[39:36] goodness sometimes I don't even know how
[39:38] to preach I don't even want to preach
[39:40] you know what I'd like to do sit down
[39:41] with a cup of coffee and let's just talk
[39:42] you
[39:43] know because you miss so much and you
[39:46] can't incorporate everything there's so
[39:47] much I want to say and I don't want to I
[39:50] don't want to say things too strong this
[39:51] way I don't want to say to I just want
[39:53] to tell you what's in my heart what I
[39:55] see in the scriptures and where we're at
[39:57] in our
[39:58] day amen because God is still saving
[40:02] today but he's saving by the same means
[40:04] he's always
[40:05] saved he's saving by faith in the I am
[40:08] the present tense God the god who's
[40:11] fulfilling his word today and when he
[40:13] fulfills his word that's God because
[40:15] God's not separate than his word so when
[40:17] you see the Fulfillment of the word
[40:19] that's God to recognize it is to see God
[40:22] which is Christ because Christ is the
[40:24] word and when the word comes into
[40:25] manifestation that's Christ
[40:29] to reject that is to reject Christ to
[40:31] receive that is to receive
[40:34] Christ and that's the way it's always
[40:36] been this is not anything new this is
[40:38] the way the just go back and read the
[40:40] Bible it's always been this
[40:44] way but I want to take a a look at Luke
[40:47] for just a minute we're in Luke let's go
[40:48] to Luke
[40:55] 4 Luke chapter 4
[40:57] 4 verse
[41:02] 16 Luke 4
[41:06] and16 and before I read this don't read
[41:09] it look up with
[41:10] me I want to make a disclaimer because I
[41:13] know when we have a group of people our
[41:15] minds are always wondering different
[41:17] spots when I talk about being saved in
[41:19] our day I'm talking about the elect
[41:21] predestinated seed amen we know good and
[41:24] well that there's going to be multitudes
[41:26] that'll be saved but that Sal will be
[41:27] meet out at the white Throne judgment
[41:29] and it'll be based on what they did with
[41:31] the word and when they were presented to
[41:32] it but they're not the ones with the
[41:34] faith of God to believe in the present
[41:36] tense truth amen all right we understand
[41:39] that I hope we all understand that right
[41:41] yes sir will they be saved absolutely
[41:43] brother B said they will be saved
[41:45] they'll be saved they're saved
[41:46] potentially now but they'll be saved
[41:49] amen as long as their names remain on
[41:51] the uh Lamb's Book of Life amen at the
[41:54] white Throne judgment they'll they'll be
[41:56] saved and they'll ENT enter into life
[41:58] not previously having had it cuz they
[42:00] were never born again right but when I'm
[42:03] talking salvation I'm not talking about
[42:05] those that are rescued in a future
[42:07] judgment I'm talking about a Salvation
[42:09] that causes you to bypass the judgment
[42:11] and never come into
[42:13] condemnation I'm talking about how the
[42:15] elect of God are saved in every
[42:17] generation and they're always saved by
[42:19] believing the present tense I am truth
[42:22] of God so don't think that I'm saying
[42:25] nobody else will ever make it there's
[42:26] mult multitudes that are going to be
[42:28] entering into to the new heavens and new
[42:29] earth but they're going to be entering
[42:30] in on a different basis than what you
[42:33] and I are are bypassing the judgment and
[42:35] coming to the Millennium for I hope
[42:38] that's clear and if we need to clear it
[42:39] up we can clear it up we got all kinds
[42:42] of quotes and I got them here on the
[42:43] notes but I don't want to take the time
[42:45] to go into all of that but I just want
[42:46] to stay focused on this I'm talking
[42:48] about the salvation of the
[42:51] elect Luke
[42:54] 4:16 and he came to Nazareth where he
[42:56] had been brought up and as his custom
[42:59] was he went into the synagogue on the
[43:00] Sabbath day and stood up for to read and
[43:03] there was delivered unto him the book of
[43:04] the prophet Isaiah and when he had
[43:07] opened the book he found the place where
[43:09] it was written the spirit of the Lord is
[43:11] upon me because he had anointed me to
[43:13] preach the gospel to the poor he sent me
[43:16] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[43:18] Deliverance to the captives and recovery
[43:21] of sight to the blind to set at Liberty
[43:24] them that are bruised to preach the
[43:26] acceptable youth ear of the
[43:29] Lord all of that is
[43:32] salvation going to read it
[43:35] again to heal the
[43:38] brokenhearted salvation is to
[43:41] heal to preach Deliverance to the
[43:44] captives it's to rescue and deliver
[43:47] that's also
[43:50] Soo recovery of sight to the blind
[43:53] that's healing to set at Liberty them
[43:56] that are bro
[43:59] what was he come to do the son of man
[44:02] came to save that which was
[44:04] losten he come to heal the
[44:07] brokenhearted he did that for the woman
[44:09] at the
[44:11] well he come to set at Liberty those
[44:13] that were bound he did that for the
[44:15] woman who washed his
[44:17] feet he come to heal the brokenhearted
[44:20] he did that he did all of these things
[44:23] why because those who had Faith to
[44:25] believe him were saved
[44:27] amen there were multitudes who who who
[44:30] remained with a broken heart blind and
[44:32] bound and captive yeah right so he came
[44:37] he came to heal the
[44:40] brokenhearted he came to preach the poor
[44:44] the the gospel to the poor to heal the
[44:47] brokenhearted to to bind up those who
[44:49] were bruised and and set at Liberty
[44:52] those that were captive to Open the Eyes
[44:54] of the blind he came to do all of
[44:57] that but he could only do that for the
[45:00] people who could believe him and those
[45:03] who believe him all got the benefit of
[45:06] his coming they were healed they were
[45:09] restored they were rescued their broken
[45:11] heart was mended amen because that's
[45:14] part of the word and part of the
[45:15] Salvation and don't forget that God is
[45:17] still preaching the word and if he's
[45:19] still preaching the word he's still
[45:21] binding up broken hearts he's still
[45:23] healing those that that are sick he's
[45:25] still healing those that are captive
[45:27] amen praise God God is still here to
[45:31] save he's saving but saving also means
[45:35] to keep
[45:38] saved to keep what delivered to keep
[45:42] rescued to keep
[45:44] healed amen you know we we come back to
[45:47] service time and time and time again we
[45:49] say well we're already saved amen I
[45:52] don't know about you but I'm still
[45:53] getting saved I'm still being healed I'm
[45:55] still being restored I'm still being
[45:58] rescued I'm still being bound up I'm
[46:00] still being set
[46:01] free amen I come through life with all
[46:04] kinds of things and all kinds of baggage
[46:06] and all kinds of my own thinking and
[46:08] things I hurt people hurt me things I've
[46:10] hurt myself with amen but it's the
[46:12] preaching of this present tense truth
[46:14] that is still unlocking and freeing and
[46:16] setting us free it's still saving us
[46:19] friends I don't look at Salvation in the
[46:22] old traditional way as I said a sinner's
[46:24] prayer one day at an altar and I was
[46:26] saved oh praise God I think we're going
[46:28] to see in the scriptures that that
[46:29] doesn't even hold up anymore because s
[46:32] salvation was based on faith amen it's
[46:34] not what I believe then it's what I
[46:36] believe now and continue to believe and
[46:38] keep walking in the truth as he unveils
[46:40] the truth and as I keep walking in the
[46:42] truth as he unveils the truth it'll keep
[46:44] healing and restoring and delivering and
[46:47] setting me
[46:48] [Music]
[46:49] free that's saved friends we're we're
[46:52] saved we're being saved yeah amen amen
[46:58] amen that's why I love to come to hear
[47:00] the preaching of the word that's why I
[47:02] love to hear the prophet's voice amen
[47:04] why because that presentant truth is
[47:06] still unlocking the things that are
[47:07] locked inside of me it's still freeing
[47:09] the things that have me bound it's still
[47:11] setting my mind free from the captiv
[47:14] Captivity of wrong
[47:18] thinking amen wasn't something that just
[47:21] happened once long ago that's a
[47:23] traditional way of talking about it's
[47:24] not even evil to talk about it that way
[47:26] I'm not I'm not saying we should change
[47:28] all of our language but there's a
[47:30] traditional
[47:31] idea I said a sinner's prayer one day
[47:34] and I'm saved and I'm saved forever but
[47:37] listen that's only for the
[47:40] elect and the elect will keep walking in
[47:43] truth
[47:46] amen we're going to
[47:48] read we're going to read some scriptures
[47:51] while we're in Luke I want to read one
[47:52] more in Luke chapter 8
[47:58] Luke
[48:02] 8:1 Luke 811 reads now the parable is
[48:05] this the seed is the word of
[48:08] God those by the wayside are they that
[48:10] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[48:13] away the word out of the take the word
[48:15] out of their hearts lest they should
[48:17] believe and be
[48:19] saved amen
[48:23] Soo if that word in their heart if they
[48:26] believe believe that word they would be
[48:28] saved yeah they would be healed
[48:31] delivered rescued made whole free from
[48:36] destruction let's go to Matthew 10
[48:52] now Matthew
[48:55] 10 and verse ver
[48:58] 22 and you shall be hated of all men for
[49:01] my name's sake but he that endureth to
[49:04] the end shall be
[49:07] saved I hope you catch that he that
[49:10] endureth to the end shall be saved not
[49:14] the person who said a prayer one time
[49:16] that was in the Baptist order of repeat
[49:20] after me and say this and now you're
[49:21] saved right amen that's a church
[49:24] tradition yeah but but he that endureth
[49:27] to the end shall be
[49:31] saved I know sometimes that rakes
[49:33] against our traditional understanding
[49:36] but it's the scriptures amen let's turn
[49:39] to Jude chapter 1
[50:04] Jude verse
[50:07] 5 I will therefore put you in
[50:09] remembrance though you you once knew
[50:11] this how that the Lord having saved Soo
[50:14] the people out of the land of Egypt
[50:16] afterward destroyed them that believe
[50:20] not they were
[50:22] saved he saved them out of Egypt he
[50:25] rescued them he deliver delivered them
[50:27] out of
[50:28] bondage is that true
[50:31] amen and when they saw all the Miracles
[50:34] and they saw uh Egypt destroyed and they
[50:37] saw the plagues fall they were able to
[50:40] believe they believed Moses they
[50:43] believed that Moses was sent by God and
[50:44] we know this was quite a struggle for
[50:46] them for when Moses first came things
[50:48] got difficult and they didn't believe
[50:49] Moses and they wanted to reject Moses
[50:51] but God gave Moses two signs and so
[50:53] there was this back and forth this
[50:54] Warfare but then when the plagues began
[50:57] to continue on and they saw more and
[50:59] more destruction coming uh to Egypt then
[51:02] they began to believe more and more and
[51:03] then finally uh uh Moses brought them
[51:05] the message of the Passover amen and
[51:07] those those who believed Moses and
[51:09] followed his instruction were
[51:11] saved they were saved from the Death
[51:13] Angel The Death Angel passed when it saw
[51:15] the blood amen they were saved from
[51:18] Egypt they were saved from destruction
[51:20] they were saved from the bondage of
[51:21] slavery but that wasn't the end of God's
[51:24] salvation because salvation is more amen
[51:27] than just rescuing from bondage God
[51:29] wanted to make them whole and restore
[51:31] them he wanted to bring them to the
[51:32] Fulfillment of the promise he wanted to
[51:35] save them from bondage but he wanted to
[51:37] make them whole in their own land
[51:39] restored under the promise the promise
[51:41] that was given to Abraham that was also
[51:44] part of
[51:45] salvation Salvation wasn't just rescue
[51:48] from Egypt salvation to heal to restore
[51:51] to make whole was also to place them in
[51:54] the promised land according to his work
[51:57] Amen to to be their God to bring them
[51:59] into the land Amen to give them peace
[52:01] and safety in a land that flows with
[52:03] milk and honey according to the promise
[52:05] that he gave to Abraham that was also
[52:07] salvation because that was a restoration
[52:10] back to the
[52:13] promise so they were
[52:15] saved but they didn't go on in
[52:19] Salvation why where did they hang up
[52:22] they
[52:24] disbelieved because salvation is is
[52:26] based on
[52:28] faith and when you stop
[52:31] believing you stop being
[52:34] healed you stop being restored you sto
[52:37] being rescued you sto being
[52:40] delivered you were delivered they were
[52:42] no longer in Egypt but they couldn't go
[52:44] all the way to the promise they were
[52:47] hung up somewhere in the process of
[52:49] salvation but never to be able to move
[52:52] on to the fullness of their Redemption
[52:56] he redeemed them out of the land but he
[52:57] redeemed them to bring them into his
[52:59] land yeah and give them his land and be
[53:01] their God and to be a chosen Nation unto
[53:07] him so he had saved the people out of
[53:09] the land of Egypt afterward destroyed
[53:12] them that believed
[53:15] not they came out singing shouting
[53:21] dancing and they come to the Red
[53:24] Sea another obstacle
[53:27] and in the obstacle they begin to murmur
[53:29] and complain and and accuse Moses and
[53:32] God delivered them again they got to the
[53:34] other side of the Red Sea and guess what
[53:35] they did took the tambourines and sang
[53:37] and danced all over
[53:39] again this is amazing
[53:42] friends
[53:43] see there's a difference between the
[53:49] elect and and those that are in the
[53:54] church just say it that way
[53:57] amen because then they they come on and
[54:00] you know every stop along the way there
[54:02] was another battle when things got
[54:04] difficult when they couldn't see
[54:06] Deliverance when they couldn't
[54:07] understand when it looked like they were
[54:09] having hardship or difficulty they
[54:11] didn't understand any of that and so
[54:13] they they began to murmur and complain
[54:15] and accuse Moses and they were constant
[54:17] it was constantly back and forth then
[54:18] God would deliver then they would
[54:20] rejoice and then they would get into
[54:21] another obstacle and they would murmur
[54:23] and complain and then God would deliver
[54:24] then they would rejoice and Fin fin they
[54:26] came to the obstacle that was
[54:28] insurmountable they had to go in and
[54:30] take the land that was full of Giants
[54:31] and full of wall cities people with
[54:33] chariots and armor and horses and armies
[54:36] and all of a sudden they come to the
[54:37] Fulfillment of the promise they came to
[54:40] their fullness of their
[54:42] salvation to the promise the reason they
[54:44] were delivered was to take the land to
[54:47] fulfill the promise he made to Abraham
[54:49] to be Abraham's seed in God's land and
[54:51] they come to the actual border of the
[54:54] very promise itself and when they came
[54:56] to that they looked across and they sent
[54:58] spies who came back with an evil report
[55:00] and say the land surely filled with milk
[55:02] and honey all that Moses told us is true
[55:05] but listen friends there's no way that
[55:07] we can do this they're walled cities
[55:09] they're Mighty Men they're huge of
[55:10] stature they have all this armor they
[55:12] have everything we can't do it we can't
[55:15] go amen and what did they do they
[55:17] disbelieved the
[55:19] word they had believed the word
[55:24] yeah they believed Moses Moes was a
[55:26] prophet they believe Moses was sin of
[55:28] God they believe God rescued them out of
[55:32] Egypt they belied that it was the time
[55:34] for the Fulfillment of the promise they
[55:35] belied they were being redeemed they
[55:37] believed they belied they belied but
[55:38] they came to a place where they could no
[55:40] longer believe yeah but there was two
[55:44] who could
[55:45] am there was two who could believe and
[55:48] know who were those those were the
[55:50] predestinated elected seat of God those
[55:53] were the children of God
[55:58] guess what they were
[56:03] saved when everybody else disbelieved
[56:06] then wandered 40 years in the wilderness
[56:08] and were destroyed because of unbelief
[56:11] amen guess who was saved by faith it was
[56:14] it was Caleb and Joshua they were still
[56:17] alive after everybody else had died what
[56:19] preserved their life they were saved
[56:21] amen because they had Faith to believe
[56:23] in a present tense truth when they come
[56:25] to the wall then when they come and saw
[56:27] the wall said listen you're not talking
[56:28] to people who heard the report they went
[56:30] and saw the Giants they saw the cities
[56:33] they saw what the 10 spies saw and they
[56:35] saw how impossible it was but they
[56:37] didn't look at the city they didn't look
[56:39] at the Giants they didn't look at the
[56:40] spears they looked at the promise in
[56:42] God's word and something inside of them
[56:45] could say hey they're but bread for
[56:48] us it wasn't logical it wasn't
[56:52] intelligent amen it was different than
[56:54] what everybody else in the camp was
[56:55] saying
[56:57] yeah Hallelujah there was a seat
[57:01] inside they couldn't explain
[57:03] it Caleb went running amongst them and
[57:06] said don't do it listen we can do
[57:12] it he had faith and his faith is what
[57:16] saved
[57:17] him saved him for 40
[57:20] years of Destruction in the
[57:23] wilderness kept him safe kept him whole
[57:26] kept him strong yeah till 40 years later
[57:29] when he was 80 years old he come to
[57:31] Joshua and said give me my Mountain amen
[57:34] I'm as strong this day as the day when I
[57:37] spied out the land 40 years ago strong
[57:40] to go out and strong to come in amen
[57:42] what had preserved him was Faith what
[57:45] had saved him was Faith what made him
[57:46] whole and kept him whole was his faith
[57:50] he still had it 40 years later he was
[57:52] eager to go run the Giants off of his
[57:55] Mountain 40 years later later because he
[57:57] believed the word of God he could
[57:59] believe it it was his
[58:03] salvation but all those who couldn't
[58:05] believe
[58:06] it they
[58:10] died oh praise
[58:14] God let's go to Second Timothy chapter 4
[58:33] we're still talking about this word
[58:35] Soo it's a big word I mean it's a little
[58:38] word s o Zoo but it's a big word it's
[58:41] big for
[58:43] us I hope our idea of being saved I hope
[58:47] it
[58:48] changes second Timothy 4:18
[59:00] and the Lord shall deliver me from every
[59:02] evil work and shall preserve me unto his
[59:04] Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory
[59:06] forever and ever amen the word Soo is in
[59:11] this
[59:12] sentence it's the word
[59:15] preserve and the Lord shall deliver me
[59:18] from every evil work and will preserve
[59:20] me he will save
[59:23] me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to be glory
[59:26] forever and ever that means to Paul to
[59:31] the Apostle Paul salvation wasn't
[59:33] something that took place on the road to
[59:36] Damascus
[59:37] only salvation was something that was
[59:40] going to carry him all the way
[59:42] through that was going to preserve or
[59:44] save him unto the kingdom of the
[59:47] Lord amen I'd like to just say my
[59:51] salvation wasn't something that happened
[59:52] years
[59:53] ago my salvation is going on
[59:57] now amen he's preserving me now God the
[1:00:00] soo for me
[1:00:03] now you know who wasn't preserved unto
[1:00:07] the Heavenly
[1:00:08] Kingdom
[1:00:10] Deus who left
[1:00:12] Paul he forsook the word for what having
[1:00:16] loved this present
[1:00:18] world and brother Benham told us when he
[1:00:21] preached on Deus he told us Deus didn't
[1:00:23] go into the world he didn't go to
[1:00:24] nightclubs
[1:00:26] went on being a
[1:00:28] Christian he just couldn't bear the
[1:00:30] reproach of Paul who was the church age
[1:00:32] messenger the word for his day so he
[1:00:34] forsook the
[1:00:36] word and stayed in
[1:00:40] church but Paul who stayed with the word
[1:00:43] was preserved unto the Heavenly Kingdom
[1:00:47] he was saved and kept
[1:00:52] saved and had the promise of continually
[1:00:56] being
[1:00:57] saved unto the kingdom and the Heavenly
[1:01:02] Kingdom let's go to John chapter
[1:01:05] 10 back to the Gospel of
[1:01:16] John John chapter
[1:01:18] 10 I like to read verse
[1:01:24] 7 then said Jesus unto them again verily
[1:01:27] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[1:01:30] the sheep all that ever came before me
[1:01:33] are thieves and robbers but the Sheep
[1:01:35] did not hear them I am the door by me if
[1:01:38] any man enter in he shall be saved and
[1:01:41] he shall go in and out and find
[1:01:44] pasture so Jesus is the door of
[1:01:49] Salvation it's found in him he is the
[1:01:52] door he is the gate let's go to Acts
[1:01:54] chapter 2
[1:01:58] Acts chapter
[1:02:03] 2 and verse 21 acts chap 2 verse
[1:02:11] 21 and it shall come to pass that
[1:02:13] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:02:15] Lord shall be
[1:02:17] saved this is an interesting
[1:02:20] verse it says whosoever shall call on
[1:02:22] the name of the Lord shall be saved this
[1:02:25] is a promise of salvation for all those
[1:02:27] who call on the name of the
[1:02:29] Lord so is everybody who confesses the
[1:02:32] name Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] saved it's an interesting scripture
[1:02:38] lovely brother venam gives us an answer
[1:02:40] to
[1:02:40] this first I want to read one other
[1:02:42] scripture while we're here go to verse
[1:02:46] 46 verse
[1:02:50] 46 and they continuing daily with one
[1:02:53] Accord in the temple and breaking bread
[1:02:55] from house to the house did eat their
[1:02:56] meat with gladness and singleness of
[1:02:58] heart praising God and having favor with
[1:03:00] all the people and the Lord added to the
[1:03:04] church daily such as should be
[1:03:06] saved so who added to the church the
[1:03:10] Lord how did he add them who did he add
[1:03:13] such as should be saved they were
[1:03:14] ordained unto this they were the
[1:03:17] predestinated they should be saved and
[1:03:19] they were able to believe so I want to
[1:03:22] go uh to Acts chapter 4 now remember who
[1:03:25] whosoever calls on the name of the Lord
[1:03:27] should be saved acts chap
[1:03:33] 4 verse 8 acts
[1:03:39] 4:8 said then Peter filled with the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[1:03:43] people and Elders of Israel if we this
[1:03:46] day be examined of the good deed done to
[1:03:48] the impotent Man by what means he is
[1:03:50] made whole be it of known unto you and
[1:03:52] all to all the people of Israel that by
[1:03:54] the name of Jesus Christ Christ of
[1:03:56] Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God
[1:03:58] raised from the dead even by him do this
[1:04:00] man stand here before you
[1:04:03] whole this is the stone which was set at
[1:04:06] knot of the builders which has become
[1:04:08] the head of the corner neither is there
[1:04:10] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:04:12] other name under Heaven given among men
[1:04:14] whereby we must be saved so salvation is
[1:04:18] in the name of Jesus Christ sir that
[1:04:21] right and so if if salvation is in the
[1:04:24] name of Jesus Christ then everybody who
[1:04:27] in prayer confesses the name of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ and says Jesus Christ was the son
[1:04:31] of God who died long ago then they're
[1:04:33] all
[1:04:34] saved it's a good
[1:04:36] question but brother brandom says in
[1:04:39] 1965 God's only provided place of
[1:04:41] worship he said and the name is in the
[1:04:44] word because he is the word I want you
[1:04:47] to notice that every time that God
[1:04:50] brought a new revelation to his children
[1:04:52] he changed his title amen he gave them
[1:04:55] revelation of himself and he would come
[1:04:57] from a different title Jehovah Gyra
[1:04:59] Jehovah siku Jehovah nii he always had
[1:05:02] another way of expressing himself so
[1:05:04] that he would be to them a present tense
[1:05:07] God and they would have a new name y
[1:05:12] amen we know it wasn't the name the name
[1:05:13] of God is Jesus Christ but a new name a
[1:05:15] new title a new way in which to address
[1:05:18] God and the attribute that was being
[1:05:20] expressed in that day because God was
[1:05:22] always expressing himself more and more
[1:05:23] to his children and wanted to know him
[1:05:26] in his new name and brother R said and
[1:05:28] the name is the is in the word because
[1:05:30] he is the word I I hope you catch that
[1:05:33] and his name is in the
[1:05:36] word so his name is not separated from
[1:05:40] the word for he is the
[1:05:42] word I hope you're catching this you can
[1:05:45] say a name and the name that we say is
[1:05:48] actually English name it's a
[1:05:50] pronunciation that wasn't the
[1:05:51] pronunciation that was called over him
[1:05:53] when he was a young boy running around
[1:05:56] Mary never said Jesus the way we say it
[1:05:58] yeah are you clear amen so it's not the
[1:06:02] pronunciation of the name CU whatever
[1:06:04] country you're in you'll say it
[1:06:06] differently yeah but the name is in the
[1:06:10] word because he is the word so his name
[1:06:14] is attached to the word and you can't
[1:06:17] disattach it from the word and call his
[1:06:20] name because if you separate it from the
[1:06:21] word you no longer have the right
[1:06:23] identification for the name you name
[1:06:26] amen that's right you're calling a name
[1:06:29] but it's not the identity of the person
[1:06:31] you're calling for for the identity is
[1:06:33] attached to the
[1:06:35] word to the scriptures to the Bible to
[1:06:38] the word made manifest now listen to
[1:06:41] what he says next the name is in the
[1:06:43] word because he is the word amen is that
[1:06:46] right what is he then the word
[1:06:50] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[1:06:52] name of God Amen the word interpreted
[1:06:55] what do we have today we have the word
[1:06:57] interpreted amen by a prophet when we
[1:07:00] call the name Jesus Christ we know him
[1:07:02] and his identification today who he is
[1:07:05] present tense Jesus Christ not a
[1:07:08] historical Jesus not what he was but who
[1:07:10] he is
[1:07:13] now amen I said this before you can you
[1:07:17] can you can call up one of my friends
[1:07:19] from high school and you can call them
[1:07:21] and talk to them and say hey do you know
[1:07:23] Chad Lamb they say oh yeah I know Chad
[1:07:25] Lam I I know him really well we went to
[1:07:28] school for high school for two three
[1:07:30] years
[1:07:32] together but if I haven't spoke to
[1:07:35] them for how long is it now like I do
[1:07:38] some
[1:07:39] math 29 30 years if I haven't spoke to
[1:07:43] them in 30 years they can claim that me
[1:07:45] they know me they can have my name and
[1:07:47] they can call my name all they want but
[1:07:49] they don't know me at all they don't
[1:07:51] know me as a husband they don't know me
[1:07:52] as a father they don't know they don't
[1:07:54] know who I am as a and they don't know
[1:07:56] me they know who I was and they have my
[1:07:58] name but they don't have my name cuz my
[1:08:00] name is attached to my person to who I
[1:08:03] actually am present tense that's my name
[1:08:06] not who I was but who I
[1:08:10] am so the word interpreted is the
[1:08:13] manifestation of the name no wonder
[1:08:16] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:08:19] you but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:08:20] revealed this to you who I am and Upon
[1:08:23] This Rock I'll build my place of worship
[1:08:25] and the gates of hell can't shake it
[1:08:26] down amen oh Living Church of God stand
[1:08:29] in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone
[1:08:32] you can sing the song but if you're not
[1:08:34] on Christ the word you're on teetering
[1:08:36] faltering sand but Upon This Rock Christ
[1:08:39] my
[1:08:40] word so what did what was it that Peter
[1:08:44] was given by the father he was given a
[1:08:46] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:08:49] is present tense
[1:08:52] amen amen
[1:08:55] so what is the Revelation the church is
[1:08:57] based on who Jesus Christ is present
[1:09:05] tense that's his
[1:09:07] name how could we call on the name of
[1:09:10] Jesus
[1:09:11] Christ and believing he's the second God
[1:09:14] in a trinity of
[1:09:16] gods is that Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ is that who he is is he a second
[1:09:24] God and a trinity of God
[1:09:26] there was a day that Jesus Christ
[1:09:28] covered for that his blood was atoning
[1:09:30] for that ignorance because that wasn't
[1:09:32] revealed
[1:09:33] yet but it's been revealed in this end
[1:09:35] time and to know him is to know his
[1:09:38] person who he is who he's revealed
[1:09:40] himself to
[1:09:41] be that's
[1:09:44] right praise God Psalms
[1:09:53] 10719 remember the the
[1:09:56] hardest scriptures to
[1:09:59] believe has always been the ones that
[1:10:01] are manifest in your
[1:10:03] day all through the Bible the hardest
[1:10:08] scriptures the hardest scriptures to
[1:10:10] believe this is what brother B said over
[1:10:11] and over man will always tell you what
[1:10:13] God's done and always point you to what
[1:10:15] he will do but ignoring what he's doing
[1:10:17] today am
[1:10:19] amen but look at Psalms 107:19
[1:10:26] uh
[1:10:27] yeah then they cry unto the Lord in
[1:10:29] their trouble and he saveth them out of
[1:10:32] their
[1:10:33] distress he sent his word and healed
[1:10:36] them and delivered them from their
[1:10:40] destructions how does God save us he
[1:10:43] sends his
[1:10:45] word how does he save us how does he
[1:10:47] heal us from all our destructions he
[1:10:49] sends his word how did God save us in
[1:10:51] this end time he sent the
[1:10:53] message it's our
[1:10:56] salvation it's our Redemption it's our
[1:10:58] healing it's our restoration it's
[1:11:01] everything that Soo is in the Bible this
[1:11:04] message is all of that to
[1:11:08] us brother bam said in
[1:11:11] 1957 and a message and then Jesus came
[1:11:15] your presence is here to do the greatest
[1:11:17] healing to heal the sinick soul to heal
[1:11:22] the weary to bring those in who are
[1:11:24] indifferent those
[1:11:25] those people who join church and doesn't
[1:11:27] know you by the spirit they've never
[1:11:29] been born again they don't know what it
[1:11:31] means to have peace the perfect peace
[1:11:33] that passes
[1:11:35] understanding what does that his
[1:11:38] presence his presence present
[1:11:41] tense is here to do the greatest healing
[1:11:45] his word is here how do you know he's
[1:11:47] here his word is made manifest today
[1:11:50] he's here to heal the sin sick Soul how
[1:11:55] how did the soul get
[1:11:58] sick amen by leaving the
[1:12:02] word by rejecting the truth by moving
[1:12:05] away from the
[1:12:07] word so how is he going to heal the sin
[1:12:10] sick Soul by bringing his
[1:12:16] word and modern events made clear by
[1:12:20] prophecy so now and with patience we
[1:12:23] have to wait for this for the prophecies
[1:12:24] that's promised every one of them must
[1:12:27] be fulfilled in its age for it is for it
[1:12:29] tells us the author has before done this
[1:12:31] and we wait to see him do it again what
[1:12:34] a time it is that we're living in
[1:12:36] something like a calendar you look at a
[1:12:38] calendar to find out what day of the
[1:12:39] year you're living in and you look at
[1:12:41] God's Bible to see what age we're living
[1:12:43] in we are not living in the Methodist
[1:12:45] age the Baptist age we're living in the
[1:12:47] bride age the calling now he's going to
[1:12:51] describe what it is yes the calling
[1:12:54] bringing back to God through a channel
[1:12:57] that he promised to bring it back in
[1:13:00] what is the bright age it's bringing the
[1:13:03] church the elect back to God through a
[1:13:07] channel that he promised to bring in
[1:13:08] what was the channel through the
[1:13:10] prophetic word the prophetic word is the
[1:13:12] channel amen and faith in that channel
[1:13:14] brings us back to what what is the bride
[1:13:17] age what is the message what is God
[1:13:18] trying to do God is presenting himself
[1:13:21] Amen to his bride he's unveiling himself
[1:13:24] he's opening the the word he's revealing
[1:13:26] who he really is so that we would know
[1:13:28] who Jesus Christ really is present tense
[1:13:32] not what the nominations made him not
[1:13:34] what he was not not what he was in the
[1:13:35] previous generation but what he is today
[1:13:38] the message came to peel back all the
[1:13:40] misunder understanding to present Christ
[1:13:42] to a
[1:13:43] bride and to present a bride to Christ
[1:13:46] to what to heal to restore to
[1:13:52] save amen
[1:13:57] the bride AG is to bring
[1:13:59] back through a channel that he promised
[1:14:02] let's turn together to Ephesians chapter
[1:14:13] 4 Ephesians
[1:14:16] 4 and
[1:14:20] 17 Ephesians
[1:14:23] 4 and 7
[1:14:31] this I say therefore and testifying the
[1:14:33] Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[1:14:36] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:14:38] their mind having the understanding
[1:14:41] darken being alienated from the life of
[1:14:43] God through the ignorance that is in
[1:14:44] them because of the blindness of their
[1:14:48] heart listen he's trying to trying to
[1:14:51] get the people to see you were blind
[1:14:55] don't walk as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:14:57] vanity of their
[1:14:59] mind being having their understanding
[1:15:02] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:15:04] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:15:07] them because of the blindness of their
[1:15:09] heart listen friends this is the
[1:15:11] condition you and I were born
[1:15:13] in this is how we
[1:15:15] came we came ignorant we came
[1:15:21] blind and alienated from the life of God
[1:15:25] that's how we were what did we need we
[1:15:28] needed
[1:15:29] saved we needed our blindness removed we
[1:15:32] needed to be restored back to God Amen
[1:15:35] we needed our ignorance
[1:15:37] removed that's the condition we were in
[1:15:40] brother Brandon preaches a message in
[1:15:42] 1964 called spiritual Amnesia and he
[1:15:45] says now this Amnesia we're told because
[1:15:48] it it CS you to be to a place where you
[1:15:51] cannot identify yourself brother spends
[1:15:55] a lot of time in spiritual Amnesia and
[1:15:57] and he talks about uh he tells different
[1:15:59] stories but he talks about uh sometimes
[1:16:01] in the war the different ones who were
[1:16:03] shell shocked and they had Amnesia and
[1:16:05] they forgot who they were they couldn't
[1:16:07] identify they couldn't tell you their
[1:16:08] name they didn't know if they were
[1:16:09] married they didn't know where they Liv
[1:16:10] they didn't know where they came from
[1:16:11] they didn't know who their parents were
[1:16:13] they had complete Amnesia it was erased
[1:16:15] all they knew was the present they
[1:16:16] didn't know
[1:16:18] anything it calls you to a place where
[1:16:20] you cannot identify yourself that's
[1:16:22] spiritual am that's amnesia
[1:16:25] now it's an unusual thing it don't
[1:16:28] happen too often but the causes is from
[1:16:30] shock it's somebody that don't even know
[1:16:32] who they are you find it from war
[1:16:35] sometimes soldiers get it sometimes
[1:16:36] people get it another thing that causes
[1:16:38] it is worry worry will cause
[1:16:42] it this is good brother REM said another
[1:16:45] thing that will cause it is being halt
[1:16:47] between two
[1:16:48] opinions you don't know whether this is
[1:16:50] true or that's true and you're somewhere
[1:16:51] in between you don't know whether you
[1:16:53] should do this or you don't know whether
[1:16:54] you should do that you're somewhere in
[1:16:56] between he said that will cause that
[1:16:58] will cause Amnesia being halt between
[1:17:01] two opinions being Shell Shocked because
[1:17:04] you took a blow from a war that'll cause
[1:17:06] Amnesia and worry he said will cause
[1:17:12] Amnesia even if it's temporary
[1:17:17] Amnesia because when I say Amnesia you
[1:17:19] think well I never forgot who I was cuz
[1:17:21] I worried or got between no temporarily
[1:17:25] you're no longer identifying yourself
[1:17:29] properly under worry when you're worried
[1:17:32] about something and stressed and you're
[1:17:34] afraid you become afraid and you forget
[1:17:36] you're a Son of God you get nervous that
[1:17:39] you're not going to be a a saved you get
[1:17:41] nervous that you're not going to come
[1:17:42] out of this situation that you're not
[1:17:44] going to be rescued that's spiritual
[1:17:46] Amnesia because you're no longer
[1:17:47] identifying yourself as a Son of
[1:17:49] God you get between two opinions and you
[1:17:52] don't know which way is right or what
[1:17:54] thing I should should do and which
[1:17:55] direction I should go and all of a
[1:17:57] sudden you start looking at all of these
[1:17:59] things you're looking at yourself you
[1:18:00] try to solve the equation and you can
[1:18:02] easily slip back into spiritual Amnesia
[1:18:05] and not be able to properly identify
[1:18:06] yourself because you don't know what you
[1:18:09] are don't know if I'm this or I don't
[1:18:11] know if I'm this that can cause you not
[1:18:14] to be able to identify yourself or if
[1:18:17] you get a shock in
[1:18:19] war and I don't think any of us here
[1:18:21] have been in a literal War recently but
[1:18:24] we've been in a lot of
[1:18:26] battles anybody been in a spiritual
[1:18:29] battle been shocked maybe been rattled a
[1:18:32] little bit does anybody got
[1:18:35] rattled that can cause
[1:18:39] Amnesia temporarily not being able to
[1:18:42] identify who you are don't know if I'm
[1:18:45] in I'm out I don't know if I'm one of
[1:18:47] them or not one of them I don't know if
[1:18:48] I agree or disagree I don't know
[1:18:56] we find that this spiritual Amnesia this
[1:18:59] alienation from God this ignorance and
[1:19:02] blindness is slipped in because Adam and
[1:19:05] Eve left the
[1:19:07] word brother Ram says in in Fellowship
[1:19:10] he said when Adam and Eve separated
[1:19:12] themselves from God by sin separated
[1:19:13] them became they became a wonderer then
[1:19:16] no Fellowship wondering about weaken
[1:19:19] down watch what's the matter with man
[1:19:21] today sin has separated man from that
[1:19:23] type of Fellowship
[1:19:25] when man sin when when the woman was
[1:19:27] deceived and she sinned amen and Adam
[1:19:30] took her into his self and he left the
[1:19:32] word amen all of a sudden they become
[1:19:34] Wanderers they become separated they
[1:19:36] become alienated they lost that
[1:19:38] Fellowship that they had and they begin
[1:19:40] wandering around and they no longer had
[1:19:42] the identification that they had before
[1:19:44] because Adam was a Son of God he was a
[1:19:46] God on the earth he had control he named
[1:19:49] the animals amen he he spoke things and
[1:19:52] they moved at his command he moved
[1:19:54] creation he moved nature he could
[1:19:56] properly identify himself but he took a
[1:20:00] blow he took a he took a blow in a
[1:20:02] spiritual battle and he could no longer
[1:20:04] properly identify himself and he became
[1:20:07] just a tiller he became uh somebody who
[1:20:09] thorns and thistles were overcoming his
[1:20:11] crops now he couldn't speak them out of
[1:20:13] existence he was
[1:20:17] plowing and then his children started
[1:20:19] suffering with spiritual
[1:20:21] Amnesia started being born because of
[1:20:25] hybridization because of the fall in the
[1:20:27] garden started being born ignorant
[1:20:31] blind alienated from the life of God and
[1:20:35] that's how we all come into this world
[1:20:38] because of
[1:20:39] that because of a separation from the
[1:20:45] word but brother R tells us God has
[1:20:49] promised to
[1:20:50] restore and that's the work that he's
[1:20:52] doing now he's bringing it back back
[1:20:55] through a channel that he promised to
[1:20:57] bring it back by and Christ is the
[1:21:00] mystery of God revealed he said secondly
[1:21:01] to have the preeminence in his body of
[1:21:03] Believers that is his bride that he
[1:21:05] might live in people now he could do
[1:21:09] that in Adam and Eve but sin separated
[1:21:11] them so now there had to be some way to
[1:21:14] get them back again then further down in
[1:21:17] the same message he says notice then one
[1:21:19] like the first Adam and Eve before sin
[1:21:22] separated them in death now Christ the
[1:21:24] second Adam in life redeems his bride
[1:21:27] from death and now on his way back to
[1:21:29] the original the original Eden restoring
[1:21:32] back his bride in Fellowship back with
[1:21:34] God as husband and wife in the Garden of
[1:21:37] Eden sure Christ and his bride so what
[1:21:40] is the word what is the message for this
[1:21:42] hour doing it is saving the bride it is
[1:21:46] saving her amen and bringing her back
[1:21:49] into the position she fell from bringing
[1:21:51] her back into what she was amen she
[1:21:54] through said through seven Church ages
[1:21:56] she's fallen into ruin the church has
[1:21:57] fallen amen and separated from God and
[1:22:00] been put away yes but God in the end
[1:22:04] time through the opening of the word
[1:22:05] he's going to save her amen amen bring
[1:22:09] her back redeem her restore her and make
[1:22:13] her whole again what she was originally
[1:22:15] intended to be which was a bride for
[1:22:17] Jesus
[1:22:18] Christ and it's this message that's
[1:22:20] doing the work it's it's not just the
[1:22:22] message I I don't want to say it that
[1:22:24] way because brother bham Jesus Christ
[1:22:27] came and he preached a
[1:22:29] message but it only saved those who
[1:22:32] could
[1:22:34] believe amen it couldn't save anybody
[1:22:36] who didn't believe Paul the Apostle came
[1:22:39] and preached the message but it can only
[1:22:41] save those who believed yeah
[1:22:45] right I mean Apostle Paul he came and he
[1:22:48] preached the message and he found Lydia
[1:22:50] and he began to tell Lydia the present
[1:22:51] day truth the message of the hour and
[1:22:53] all of a sudden there was some in Lydia
[1:22:55] that could believe it yeah
[1:22:57] amen and listen Lydia had lived near a
[1:23:02] synagogue there was synagogues
[1:23:04] everywhere remember everywhere Paul went
[1:23:06] he went to the synagogue to preach so
[1:23:08] every city had a synagogue they all had
[1:23:10] a Jewish population they all all these
[1:23:12] Gentiles they had a chance to hear the
[1:23:14] history the historical God Amen The God
[1:23:17] Who parted the sea through God had did
[1:23:18] all in that but what woke up Lydia was
[1:23:21] when Paul came and told her the present
[1:23:23] tense truth
[1:23:27] amen amen that's what happened Amen to
[1:23:30] the Apostle Paul uh uh and Paul and
[1:23:32] Barnabas when they were in the book of
[1:23:34] Acts am mean they went to the synagogue
[1:23:35] preaching and all of a sudden the
[1:23:37] Gentiles heard him gladly everybody was
[1:23:38] super excited about what they heard but
[1:23:40] then some people got upset and wanted to
[1:23:42] hold to the traditional teaching and not
[1:23:43] to accept this because of the popularity
[1:23:46] of Paul and they started a big Hall of
[1:23:51] blue but Paul said it was needful that
[1:23:54] the gospel first be presented to you but
[1:23:55] Lo we turned to the Gentiles and they
[1:23:57] which were ordained into eternal life
[1:23:59] believed what did they believe they had
[1:24:02] also been part of the synagogue they
[1:24:03] first heard him in the synagogue they
[1:24:05] had heard all the traditional teaching
[1:24:07] and they liked it because there was
[1:24:08] something in them that had a capacity
[1:24:10] for truth they liked what they were
[1:24:12] hearing but when they heard the present
[1:24:14] tense I am something in them said yes
[1:24:17] that's what I want to can you come back
[1:24:18] and preach that again next week I want
[1:24:20] to hear more
[1:24:22] am some were threatened by Ministry
[1:24:25] another group wanted more of it what was
[1:24:27] it doing it was unlocking their identity
[1:24:29] they were beginning to see who they
[1:24:31] really were not just proelite Jews not
[1:24:34] just an attachment to the Jewish
[1:24:35] tradition not somebody who was allowed
[1:24:37] to just sit on the outskirts and hear
[1:24:40] what they was no they were learning by
[1:24:42] that day that Jesus Christ broke down
[1:24:43] the middle partition now there is no
[1:24:45] separation now you're a son and daughter
[1:24:47] of
[1:24:50] God what was it doing it was healing
[1:24:52] their spiritual amnesia
[1:24:54] it was saving them
[1:24:57] amen let's go to Titus Chapter 3 still
[1:25:01] want to look at Soo just a couple more
[1:25:03] times or on the subject like I said 111
[1:25:07] times we're not going to read them
[1:25:09] all we won't even read half just a
[1:25:13] fraction portion Titus Chapter
[1:25:18] 3 Verse four
[1:25:27] Titus 3 and4 but after that the kindness
[1:25:29] and love of God our savior toward man
[1:25:31] appeared not by works of righteousness
[1:25:33] which we have done but according to his
[1:25:35] Mercy he saved us that's
[1:25:38] Soo according to his Mercy he saved us
[1:25:42] by the washing of regeneration and
[1:25:44] renewing of the Holy
[1:25:46] Ghost which he shed in US abundantly
[1:25:49] through Jesus Christ Our Savior that
[1:25:51] being justified by his grace we should
[1:25:53] be made Heirs of according to the hope
[1:25:55] of eternal
[1:25:57] life so now God saved them by his
[1:26:01] through his Mercy he saved us by the
[1:26:04] washing of
[1:26:06] regeneration and the renewing of the
[1:26:08] Holy Ghost they were saved by the new
[1:26:11] birth which brother Brenham teaches is
[1:26:14] true salvation is being born again by
[1:26:16] the spirit of God not a confession but a
[1:26:20] the true salvation is a new birth to be
[1:26:24] born born again in our day for the elect
[1:26:26] to be born again by the spirit of God

[1:28:30] word which is able to save your
[1:28:34] souls brother bam says God who is rich
[1:28:37] in Mercy this quote I've read so many
[1:28:39] times but I'm going to place it here I
[1:28:41] know you know it well but we're going to
[1:28:42] read it again so I'm only saying this
[1:28:45] not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten
[1:28:46] it out that we might get away from this
[1:28:49] fear and scare you don't know who you
[1:28:51] are you're not going to be but now you
[1:28:53] are the the sons of God but's not
[1:28:56] talking future he's talking about a
[1:28:57] Salvation that's taking place now yeah a
[1:29:00] restoration a wholeness a healing of
[1:29:03] sons of
[1:29:05] God the healing of an
[1:29:08] Amnesia that caused us to be ignorant in
[1:29:11] our minds our minds darkened and
[1:29:12] alienated from the things of God there's
[1:29:14] a healing that's taking place now to
[1:29:17] take away that Amnesia that Darkness so
[1:29:20] that we can to do what to properly
[1:29:24] identify
[1:29:30] ourselves he said you don't know who you
[1:29:34] are that's
[1:29:36] Amnesia that's
[1:29:38] Amnesia you are not going to be but now
[1:29:41] you are the sons of God see you always
[1:29:43] were the sons of God for when God had
[1:29:47] you in his thinking at the beginning you
[1:29:49] have to be some part of you your life
[1:29:51] that's in you now had to be with God
[1:29:53] before well when he before he even
[1:29:56] became material here on Earth before
[1:29:58] there was anything but God you were one
[1:30:00] of his attributes he know what your name
[1:30:02] would be he know the color of hair you
[1:30:04] would have he knowed all about you the
[1:30:06] only thing happened is when you become
[1:30:09] you being a sinner many of you can
[1:30:11] fellowship with me on this thought when
[1:30:13] you was a little boy I want to stop
[1:30:15] there brother B says he knew when you
[1:30:17] would come on the earth he knew what
[1:30:19] your name would be he knew what color
[1:30:20] hair you would have and he knew what
[1:30:22] color eyes you would have so God has
[1:30:24] never had
[1:30:26] Amnesia it's only we who were born in
[1:30:29] this condition came with
[1:30:31] amnesia God knew who we were and where
[1:30:33] we were but God has a method for
[1:30:35] unlocking it to bring us out of Amnesia
[1:30:37] so that we can identify
[1:30:40] ourselves because if we don't know who
[1:30:42] we are we're still stuck in
[1:30:46] Amnesia says many of you can Fellowship
[1:30:48] me on this with me on this thought when
[1:30:50] you was a little boy or little girl you
[1:30:52] would walk around and there would be
[1:30:54] certain things that would just where it
[1:30:55] wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed
[1:30:57] like there was
[1:30:58] something in you that cried out there
[1:31:01] was God somewhere yet you were a sinner
[1:31:03] you remember that certainly now what was
[1:31:05] that that was that little form of life
[1:31:07] in you
[1:31:09] then and then after a while you heard
[1:31:11] the gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:31:13] picked out this and that and went from
[1:31:15] denomination to
[1:31:18] denomination did you catch
[1:31:21] that you picked out something you heard
[1:31:23] the gospel you went from denomination to
[1:31:25] denomination so you would have heard the
[1:31:28] traditional
[1:31:31] teaching but one day you being part of
[1:31:35] God you had to be part of the word and
[1:31:38] when you heard the word you know where
[1:31:40] you come from you know that was the
[1:31:43] truth so if you went from denomination
[1:31:46] to denomination but you didn't hear the
[1:31:48] word right but yet they were preaching
[1:31:50] out of a Bible and they were saying
[1:31:52] things that had really happened and were
[1:31:53] true
[1:31:55] what kind of word did it take to wake
[1:31:57] you up it was the word for this day it
[1:32:00] was the present it was the message of
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:06] hour but one day you being part of God
[1:32:09] you were part of the word and when you
[1:32:10] heard the word you know where you come
[1:32:12] from you know that was the truth you
[1:32:14] were always the seed was in you always
[1:32:16] the word the word seen the word that was
[1:32:19] in you that was before the foundation of
[1:32:21] the world saw the word and you came to
[1:32:24] it so what saw the word it wasn't your
[1:32:27] brain amen it was the word that was
[1:32:29] trapped inside of you that little form
[1:32:30] of life of God the word saw the word and
[1:32:32] came to
[1:32:33] it I which one came to which I don't
[1:32:36] know but there was a magnetism and these
[1:32:38] two things came
[1:32:40] together and the third seal brother says
[1:32:43] now that's what's the reason today the
[1:32:44] revivals that we're supposed to have we
[1:32:46] have denominational revivals we haven't
[1:32:48] had a real stirring no no no no no sir
[1:32:54] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:32:56] oh they've got millions and millions and
[1:32:57] millions of church members but not a
[1:32:59] Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't
[1:33:01] had a Revival yet there's been no
[1:33:03] Revival there no manifestation of God
[1:33:06] distur the bride yet see we're looking
[1:33:08] for it it will take those seven unknown
[1:33:11] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:33:14] he will send it he promised it when did
[1:33:17] he say that that was in the third seal
[1:33:20] then he comes now he comes to to 1964
[1:33:23] and he says why are they crying for
[1:33:24] revivals Revival in our day he says my
[1:33:26] good friend Jack Moore in his paper he's
[1:33:28] calling he says they haven't recognized
[1:33:30] The Awakening of the Bride what woke her
[1:33:33] up it was that hidden word that had been
[1:33:35] hid that only Christ himself could
[1:33:37] reveal and when Christ came himself and
[1:33:40] through a prophetic gift open the
[1:33:41] mystery of the seals all of a sudden
[1:33:43] there was something and wake up in the
[1:33:45] bride so she could get rid of her church
[1:33:47] Amnesia her denominational Amnesia and
[1:33:49] she could identify herself I'm not a
[1:33:51] church member I'm not I am heart of
[1:33:55] God it'll take those seven unknown
[1:33:59] Thunders to wake her
[1:34:00] up that's for the bride that's for the
[1:34:03] elect that's her
[1:34:10] salvation in the message spiritual
[1:34:13] Amnesia 1964 this is April
[1:34:16] 1964 it's a linky quote but I'm going to
[1:34:18] read it all I believe but just listen
[1:34:22] carefully now he's preaching spiritual
[1:34:24] Amnesia now to be a true Christian you
[1:34:27] have to be the same we don't want to
[1:34:29] forget that all that he was I'm
[1:34:31] identified with him I'm identified with
[1:34:34] him to be a true
[1:34:37] Christian notice and he is in me and I
[1:34:40] in him notice that every Christian
[1:34:43] that's a real genuine
[1:34:45] Christian Christian was with him when
[1:34:48] the morning Stars sang together and the
[1:34:51] sons of God shouted for Joy but before
[1:34:53] there was a foundation of the world Amen
[1:34:57] I'm going to read that
[1:34:59] again that hits me with such impact
[1:35:02] friends this message came to break
[1:35:05] spiritual Amnesia so we could properly
[1:35:06] identify
[1:35:09] ourselves every Christian that's a real
[1:35:12] genuine
[1:35:13] Christian was with him when the morning
[1:35:16] Stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:35:18] shout it for Joy before there was a
[1:35:20] foundation of the world we were
[1:35:22] identified in The Immortal Realm with
[1:35:24] God 10 million years before the world
[1:35:26] was ever formed and I was back there
[1:35:28] with him if I got eternal life I was
[1:35:30] there with him I was identified with him
[1:35:32] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:35:34] the sons of God shouted for Joy what a
[1:35:37] thing brother brandom is saying listen
[1:35:38] to what
[1:35:39] this this is a human being a man born in
[1:35:43] Kentucky amen who's ministered the
[1:35:44] gospel for so many years but he's come
[1:35:46] to a place of Revelation that his
[1:35:48] Amnesia is broke and he can identify
[1:35:51] himself and he can say that I was there
[1:35:54] when the sons of God shouted for Joy I
[1:35:56] was there amen that's a man who no
[1:35:59] longer has Amnesia amen and if we
[1:36:01] haven't come to that Revelation then
[1:36:03] there's still some spiritual Amnesia and
[1:36:05] I say God save me amen heal me open my
[1:36:09] blinded eyes free me from the alienation
[1:36:12] and the ignorance that is blinding me to
[1:36:13] the real reality of who I am that's what
[1:36:17] this message is here to do save us save
[1:36:19] us from what save us from partial save
[1:36:22] us from misunderstanding save us from
[1:36:24] Darkness save us from
[1:36:27] separation to heal to
[1:36:31] restore to buy back to make
[1:36:35] whole to deliver
[1:36:41] Amen brother said I was identified with
[1:36:44] him when the morning Stars sang together
[1:36:47] and the Suns of God shouted for
[1:36:50] Joy he goes on to say some
[1:36:54] some I'll just say it this way in the
[1:36:56] humid realm of thinking he goes on to
[1:36:58] say some extreme
[1:37:01] things I was with him when he called
[1:37:04] Abraham at the age of 75 years
[1:37:08] old and his wife being 65 I told
[1:37:12] him and told him they were going to have
[1:37:14] a baby I was with him when he took his
[1:37:16] stand upon thus sayith the Lord I'm
[1:37:18] going to have a baby I stood with him
[1:37:21] every other Christian stood with him I
[1:37:23] was was with him when his Temptations
[1:37:25] come I was with him when he went up on
[1:37:27] the top of the mountain to offer up
[1:37:29] Isaac I was with him when the ram
[1:37:31] appeared I was with Joseph when he was
[1:37:33] rejected of his brothers because he was
[1:37:35] spiritual and the rest of them was
[1:37:36] carnal I was with him when he knowed the
[1:37:38] reproach he had to stand by his own
[1:37:40] Brothers what he was I am what I am he
[1:37:44] was for we were all one in Christ Jesus
[1:37:48] I was with Joseph in his cave his grave
[1:37:50] I was with him when he went to the right
[1:37:52] hand of pharaoh you had you had to be
[1:37:55] identified with him I was with Jacob
[1:37:59] that night when he wrestled all night
[1:38:00] with the angel I've wrestled myself I
[1:38:02] know what he went through with so I
[1:38:04] wrestled with Jacob the same time he did
[1:38:06] for I am his
[1:38:08] brother I was with Moses when he went
[1:38:10] down into Egypt I was with Moses at the
[1:38:12] burning bush if you're a Christian
[1:38:14] you're identified with them Bible
[1:38:16] characters don't forget it I was with
[1:38:18] Moses when all the people turned against
[1:38:19] him I was with Moses when he crossed the
[1:38:21] Red Sea when he raised his hand and
[1:38:23] walked forward and the Red Sea opened I
[1:38:25] was identified in Christ right then and
[1:38:28] I was with Moses at that hour what every
[1:38:31] Christian has been what every believer
[1:38:32] has been every believer now is
[1:38:34] identified with the same person whatever
[1:38:37] it is you must be identified don't
[1:38:38] forget that when you do you've got
[1:38:41] spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who
[1:38:43] you
[1:38:44] are now ident now identified with him
[1:38:47] with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea I
[1:38:49] was with Elijah in the days of ABAB when
[1:38:52] they had to make a choice who they would
[1:38:54] serve God or balam we was with him on
[1:38:56] Mount Carmel when he had to make his
[1:38:58] choice for we are identified in the body
[1:39:00] of the same God that he was identified
[1:39:04] that he he was identified in so if we're
[1:39:06] identified in that body then we must
[1:39:08] remember we were with him that's right
[1:39:11] now I was with David when he was
[1:39:13] rejected by his own brother I was with
[1:39:15] David you were too if you're a Christian
[1:39:17] you have to be identified his rejection
[1:39:20] I was with the Hebrew children in the
[1:39:22] fiery furnace the fire couldn't burn
[1:39:24] them because of the presence of the
[1:39:25] fourth man I was with Daniel in the
[1:39:28] Lion's Den I was identified in there
[1:39:30] when the angel the Lord identified him
[1:39:32] there I was most surely with him at
[1:39:37] Calvary I must be identified with him at
[1:39:40] Calvary I must be there to a to a place
[1:39:43] that where not also I was identified
[1:39:46] with him at Calvary I died with him at
[1:39:47] Calvary every Christian must die with
[1:39:50] him at Calvary if you don't die with him
[1:39:52] at Calvary you can't be of his I was
[1:39:54] there when he died I died with him and
[1:39:57] then I was with him when he raised up
[1:39:58] from the dead I came up on Easter
[1:40:00] morning with him in the resurrection
[1:40:02] whatever he did I was right there with
[1:40:04] him every believer was the
[1:40:07] same and now I am seated with him in
[1:40:11] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all
[1:40:14] the powers of Hell conquered through him
[1:40:16] every Christian believer has was seated
[1:40:18] the same way cuz you have to be
[1:40:21] identified now I find myself in this
[1:40:23] last days with the many of the believing
[1:40:26] Christians identified in his ministry he
[1:40:29] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:30] I find myself in this day identified in
[1:40:34] his ministry do you find yourself that
[1:40:36] way believing it walking in it notice
[1:40:40] the works that he did he said the
[1:40:41] believer would do the same thing the
[1:40:42] works that I do shall you do also then
[1:40:44] can you be identified with him then when
[1:40:47] the reproach comes on the word Can You
[1:40:49] Stand The reproach like he did see
[1:40:52] identified with him I was identified
[1:40:55] with him brother R goes on and he goes
[1:40:57] example after example and and listen you
[1:41:00] you you you read these things and what
[1:41:02] what is he saying it sounds so extreme
[1:41:04] but the reality is if I am part of God I
[1:41:07] am part of God and wherever God was I
[1:41:10] was there too because I have
[1:41:12] representation there because what God is
[1:41:15] amen and what I am are not two separate
[1:41:17] things I'm certainly not fullness but a
[1:41:19] little measure is still part of God part
[1:41:22] of Jesus Christ part of the word to be
[1:41:24] the bride you have to be part of the
[1:41:27] word and wherever the word was you had
[1:41:29] part in
[1:41:31] that and this message came to break our
[1:41:33] spiritual Amnesia to recognize where you
[1:41:36] can say I was with the Hebrew
[1:41:38] Chen I was with the Hebrew children in
[1:41:41] the fiery furnace how I don't have
[1:41:43] conscience of it I didn't see anything I
[1:41:45] can't describe it to you but whatever is
[1:41:47] alive in me now was there whatever power
[1:41:51] is working in me was there res resing
[1:41:53] them bringing through CU it was the
[1:41:54] fourth man it was
[1:41:56] Christ and if you're part of Christ and
[1:41:59] Christ is you and you're in Christ then
[1:42:01] you were there why because whatever was
[1:42:04] there is in
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] you amen Were You There When the sons of
[1:42:10] God shout her for Joy I don't remember
[1:42:13] it I don't have consciousness of it I
[1:42:15] can't describe it to you but something
[1:42:17] inside of me jumps up and down and says
[1:42:19] amen when I hear the prophet say
[1:42:21] that why because brother brother bham
[1:42:23] said they were shouting for Joy when he
[1:42:25] showed him his Plan of Redemption and
[1:42:27] we're in the day when he's taking the
[1:42:28] veil off his Plan of Redemption and I'm
[1:42:30] shouting for Joy today at the same thing
[1:42:33] I shouted for joy in that day if I can
[1:42:36] rejoice in the opening of the seals the
[1:42:38] peeling back of the entire mystery of
[1:42:40] redemption and shout and clap my hands
[1:42:42] then I certainly can believe I did it
[1:42:44] there when I was with him
[1:42:47] there he said to be a true
[1:42:50] Christian you have to identify yourself
[1:42:52] there
[1:42:54] amen you see that's a pretty big
[1:42:56] leap it's a leap that only faith can
[1:43:00] make human mind can't make that leap
[1:43:04] it's
[1:43:06] impossible we can we can act like we can
[1:43:09] go along with That's What Judas did
[1:43:14] right Judas
[1:43:16] believed so
[1:43:18] much Judas believed Jesus was a
[1:43:21] prophet amen Judas believed all the
[1:43:24] Miracles he
[1:43:25] saw he believed in the raising of dead
[1:43:28] he believed in the opening of blind eyes
[1:43:30] Judas did it
[1:43:31] himself he cast out demons and he healed
[1:43:34] the sick because he had a portion of the
[1:43:36] ministry of
[1:43:37] Christ Judas believed that this man was
[1:43:40] righteous he believed he was a good man
[1:43:42] he believed the things that Jesus said
[1:43:45] but brother Brandon made a statement one
[1:43:46] time he said he just couldn't see that
[1:43:49] man being God
[1:43:55] he could go so long with the
[1:43:58] message the healings the campaigns the
[1:44:02] truths the
[1:44:05] Beatitudes he could go so long but when
[1:44:08] it came to accepting that that man in
[1:44:10] flesh was actually
[1:44:12] God Judas couldn't cross that line yes
[1:44:18] that's why he sold him out
[1:44:23] we can go so long with the message but
[1:44:25] you can believe that these people are
[1:44:27] Christ they are the body of Jesus Christ
[1:44:31] The Dwelling Place of Christ that the
[1:44:34] head has come to the body and they are
[1:44:39] one that message is our
[1:44:42] Salvation sir it's bringing us back to
[1:44:45] God through a channel to break away
[1:44:47] spiritual Ania so we know who we are and
[1:44:49] we know who we are we know how to act we
[1:44:51] know what to do we know what to believe
[1:44:52] we know who we
[1:44:55] are then when we get into scraps and we
[1:44:58] get into stries and we get into trouble
[1:45:01] all we have to do is look back at what
[1:45:03] happened when that happened
[1:45:06] before when the Hebrew children had to
[1:45:08] stand for their faith
[1:45:11] well I was there I can certainly stand
[1:45:13] today cuz we stood then amen amen when
[1:45:18] Moses come against the Red Sea and had
[1:45:19] no place to go I can certainly believe
[1:45:21] in the face of unsurmountable obstacles
[1:45:24] because it worked then and I was there
[1:45:26] then and he's here now and nothing has
[1:45:28] changed with the power of God I can
[1:45:31] stand in my place because of an
[1:45:32] identification of who I am amen that I'm
[1:45:35] part of this word part of it from
[1:45:37] Genesis the Revelation all I've got to
[1:45:39] do is gain strength from what I seen
[1:45:41] Christ do before Christ in me can do it
[1:45:44] again I was part of that and now they're
[1:45:46] part of
[1:45:48] me right cuz they're not yet made
[1:45:50] perfect without us
[1:45:56] this is our healing
[1:45:58] friends this message is salvation
[1:46:02] amen this message that God gave us to
[1:46:07] peel back the sickness of a sinick soul
[1:46:10] that's ignorant to who they are who God
[1:46:13] really is and what the truth really is
[1:46:15] this message is
[1:46:18] healing this message will make us whole
[1:46:21] this message will rest restore us to the
[1:46:23] right
[1:46:24] Faith this message is
[1:46:28] salvation and the true sense of Soo this
[1:46:31] is it it's delivering us bringing us
[1:46:36] back when you know that you've been part
[1:46:39] of you are part of the word that you
[1:46:42] come from God and you go to God and
[1:46:43] you're here to live out your portion of
[1:46:45] the word that he's allotted for you now
[1:46:48] when you come to obstacles when the
[1:46:50] spiritual Amnesia is gone it's totally
[1:46:53] different where before we would run
[1:46:55] crazy before worry would put us back
[1:46:57] into spiritual Amnesia being halt
[1:46:59] between two opinions would bring us back
[1:47:00] or the shock of the trial would bring us
[1:47:03] back into spiritual Amnesia if we can
[1:47:05] just hold steady and look at what God's
[1:47:06] told us amen and not go back into
[1:47:09] spiritual Amnesia so don't let being
[1:47:11] halt between two opinions bring you back
[1:47:13] out of the
[1:47:15] message don't let worry bring you out of
[1:47:19] this Revelation and don't let shell
[1:47:20] shock from hard trials amen Knock You
[1:47:23] Out amen let's hold fast and remember
[1:47:26] who he said we
[1:47:29] are and if they could stand before then
[1:47:32] with Christ we can stand now if the word
[1:47:35] could overcome then then the word can
[1:47:37] overcome Now where's the word the word
[1:47:39] is in
[1:47:40] me the same word that was there is
[1:47:44] here
[1:47:46] Lord this is our
[1:47:49] Salvation it's not a folding of the
[1:47:52] hands and repeat meeing of
[1:47:53] prayer it's not a
[1:47:56] traditional
[1:47:57] something it's not an act that took
[1:47:59] place long ago that may have been the
[1:48:01] beginning of our
[1:48:02] journey but it actually is the thing
[1:48:04] that's preserving us into the Heavenly
[1:48:06] Kingdom it's keeping us healing us
[1:48:10] delivering
[1:48:12] us amen do you still need some
[1:48:16] Deliverance do you still want more
[1:48:19] salvation amen oh I believe you know
[1:48:23] we've given our hearts to the Lord we've
[1:48:24] received his word we received him we're
[1:48:27] saved but I want to be more
[1:48:30] saved say brother CH how can you get
[1:48:32] more saved you're eternally secure I was
[1:48:34] eternally secure before the foundation
[1:48:36] of the world when my name was put in the
[1:48:37] Lamb's Book of
[1:48:39] Life the moment I recognized it was not
[1:48:41] the time I became eternally secure I've
[1:48:43] been secure I'm in a section I believe
[1:48:45] with all my heart in a section of the
[1:48:46] Lamb's Book of Life that's written an
[1:48:48] indelible ink of the blood of Jesus
[1:48:50] Christ that was shed before the
[1:48:51] foundation of the world and can no more
[1:48:52] be lost and God can be
[1:48:55] lost not worried about being lost I'm
[1:48:57] worried about being
[1:49:01] saved fully saved completely saved
[1:49:04] absolutely saved 100% made whole I want
[1:49:08] to touch the H of His Garment as he goes
[1:49:10] by in the word today that's him amen
[1:49:12] what we're preaching is the word the
[1:49:14] message is him I want to reach out and
[1:49:15] touch him and be made every bit ho I
[1:49:18] want my confusion to go away my doubt my
[1:49:20] anxiety all the things that I'm plagued
[1:49:22] with my past experiences that are still
[1:49:24] like chains around my ankles I want to
[1:49:26] get a hold of him and say bring me
[1:49:28] greater Revelation and greater
[1:49:30] Revelation that breaks away everything I
[1:49:32] want to be more saved than I was
[1:49:34] yesterday I want to be more saved
[1:49:36] tomorrow than I am today I want to be
[1:49:38] delivered made whole set free
[1:49:43] restored and this message and faith in
[1:49:47] this message is what's doing the work
[1:49:52] you say like Jesus so be it according to
[1:49:54] your
[1:49:56] faith but we all know it's not my
[1:50:00] faith it's the faith that God
[1:50:04] gives it's a gift of faith to believe
[1:50:09] and it's faith in this revealed
[1:50:12] word when Jesus looked at the woman who
[1:50:14] touched the H of His Garment he said thy
[1:50:18] faith has made you
[1:50:20] whole I don't know how
[1:50:23] I I wish I could take what's stirring in
[1:50:25] me and give it to you but he says thy
[1:50:27] faith what you found inside of you to
[1:50:30] believe in me has made you whole
[1:50:35] right listen Jesus didn't know who
[1:50:38] touched
[1:50:39] him he just felt strength went out of
[1:50:42] him and the strength that went out of
[1:50:45] him went to
[1:50:47] her not because he went and took it out
[1:50:50] and put it in her right
[1:50:53] right I hope you're understanding right
[1:50:55] amen it was because there was something
[1:50:57] in her that could reach out and pull it
[1:50:59] from
[1:51:04] him he talked to the woman who washed
[1:51:07] his feet at Simon's
[1:51:10] house and he
[1:51:12] says all your sins are
[1:51:17] forgiven listen she didn't go down
[1:51:21] through the list of sins that she had
[1:51:23] and confessed them each one to Jesus she
[1:51:26] didn't go to the priest she didn't offer
[1:51:29] a turtle
[1:51:31] dove how could Jesus say such a thing
[1:51:35] she didn't come the traditional way of
[1:51:37] paying a price she didn't list it all
[1:51:40] out she
[1:51:42] didn't when she saw the word for her day
[1:51:46] and believed it amen he said all your
[1:51:50] sins are forgiven
[1:51:55] he didn't tell her to go to the priest
[1:51:57] he didn't tell her to go to the temple
[1:51:58] he didn't tell her to offer a
[1:52:01] lamb he says your faith has saved
[1:52:07] you that's the Bible amen that's the
[1:52:12] scriptures she believed in what Simon
[1:52:14] couldn't believe she believed in what
[1:52:17] multitudes couldn't believe she believed
[1:52:19] What Judas couldn't believe that that
[1:52:22] that man is
[1:52:29] God God has placed something in his
[1:52:35] elect that when they come in contact
[1:52:38] with the manifested Jesus Christ present
[1:52:42] tense something in them says if I can
[1:52:45] touch
[1:52:46] him I'll be every bit
[1:52:49] ho if I could serve him if I could just
[1:52:52] give to
[1:52:53] him and the same thing that was true for
[1:52:57] those women is true
[1:53:00] today thy faith has made you whole
[1:53:04] because we're saved by grace through
[1:53:06] faith and that not of yourselves it is a
[1:53:10] gift of God it's not your faith your
[1:53:12] faith is weak but it's the faith that's
[1:53:14] been imparted into you before the
[1:53:17] foundation of world when it was placed
[1:53:18] in your soul that part of God you have
[1:53:20] something to believe with and that is
[1:53:22] found in you so God calls it yours when
[1:53:25] you know what good and well it's not
[1:53:26] yours it's just the part of God that's
[1:53:27] been imparted unto you amen and because
[1:53:29] it's found in
[1:53:31] you it's called
[1:53:34] yours I thank God for the faith to
[1:53:37] believe this
[1:53:38] word but I want to believe more of
[1:53:42] it I want to be further United with I I
[1:53:45] I want to touch the him of His Garment
[1:53:47] every time he passes by I want to wash
[1:53:50] his feet and serve him and kiss his feet
[1:53:52] every every chance I
[1:53:53] get I want to continue being
[1:53:57] healed I want to read one more thing
[1:53:59] from the prophet as we close musicians
[1:54:01] if you'd please come brother John if
[1:54:03] you'd make your way up please this is
[1:54:06] out a resume of the ages out of the
[1:54:07] church age book this is Brother Brenham
[1:54:09] this is the last paragraph this isn't
[1:54:11] the last sentence but it's almost the
[1:54:12] last sentence the last thing that he
[1:54:14] says in the res of the ages out of the
[1:54:17] church age book he says not for one
[1:54:19] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:54:21] people that they may follow me or join
[1:54:23] my church or start some fellowship and
[1:54:26] organization I have never done that and
[1:54:28] I will not do that now I have no
[1:54:31] interest in those things but I do have
[1:54:33] an interest in the things of God and
[1:54:35] people and if I can accomplish just one
[1:54:37] thing I will be
[1:54:39] satisfied that one thing is to see
[1:54:42] established a true spiritual
[1:54:44] relationship between God and Men wherein
[1:54:46] men become new creatures New Creations
[1:54:49] in Christ filled with the spirit and
[1:54:51] live according to his word what was
[1:54:55] brother Benham hoping his message would
[1:54:57] do it would break the Amnesia and bring
[1:55:00] man and God back together as
[1:55:02] one bring them back to their true
[1:55:04] identity where they came from and his
[1:55:07] message was to do what this what was
[1:55:10] broken in the Garden of
[1:55:12] Eden Fellowship between God and man it
[1:55:16] was broken they lost it and they began
[1:55:18] wonders and then they slipped into
[1:55:19] spiritual Amnesia and they could no
[1:55:21] longer identify themselves Fellowship
[1:55:23] was broken what did this message came to
[1:55:25] do what was brother benham's Ministry to
[1:55:26] do and what did he want to do restore
[1:55:29] broken
[1:55:30] Fellowship how did he do it through the
[1:55:33] revelation of the word which is Christ
[1:55:37] God used that vessel to present himself
[1:55:40] to his church again and say this is who
[1:55:44] I am this is
[1:55:45] me and those who could receive it found
[1:55:49] salvation and find Salvation and is
[1:55:53] finding Salvation let's all
