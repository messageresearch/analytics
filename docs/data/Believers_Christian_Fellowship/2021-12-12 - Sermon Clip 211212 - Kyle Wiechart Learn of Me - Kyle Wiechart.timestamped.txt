[0:00] and there shall be signs in the heavens
[0:02] and the moon and in the stars and upon
[0:03] the earth distress of nations
[0:06] with perplexity are we living in a
[0:08] perplexed time
[0:10] has anybody looked at the situation said
[0:12] ah
[0:14] you know you can't you can't go to the
[0:16] store right now and be sure you're going
[0:18] to get what you're looking for this has
[0:20] never happened to americans
[0:22] it's sad but come on i mean it is a sad
[0:24] problem that we have but reality has
[0:26] stead into us you don't know if you
[0:28] travel you're going to come home
[0:30] i mean this is a perplexing time this
[0:32] was this this is a time like we've never
[0:34] seen
[0:35] you you i don't look at the news hardly
[0:36] anymore it's too discouraging but you
[0:38] look at the news there isn't a day goes
[0:40] by where it just makes you want to vomit
[0:42] to see men killing their families
[0:45] kids killing their parents there's a
[0:47] school shooting in america almost every
[0:50] week
[0:51] i mean
[0:53] it's hell on earth
[0:55] this is hell on earth
[0:57] hell is spilling over brother branham
[0:59] said
[1:00] you have people driving people over
[1:03] this has become a common everyday thing
[1:06] for us in america
[1:08] it is sad but it is the reality hell is
[1:10] present but if hell's present
[1:14] heaven's present
[1:16] that means that the rock of my salvation
[1:18] is here that means that he promised
[1:20] he'll be walking with me through the
[1:21] valley of the shadow of death i'll be
[1:23] with you so i'm going to take you right
[1:25] on through i'm going to let the winds
[1:27] i'm going to let the waves i'm going to
[1:28] let the storm i'm going to let the winds
[1:30] turn contrary against you but don't you
[1:32] worry i've been training you for a long
[1:35] time and this time you're not only going
[1:37] to walk on water you're going to walk
[1:38] from one dimension to another dimension
[1:40] this was a promise that he gave and i'm
[1:42] still standing on that promise i don't
[1:44] know i don't know how he's going to do
[1:46] it i'm not trying to figure out the
[1:48] mechanics i believe the dynamics
[1:51] brother last night we're talking about
[1:52] brother enoch and trying to figure and i
[1:54] says
[1:55] i look at enoch all the time there's
[1:56] things i don't understand but i know
[1:58] this i may not know the mechanics of how
[2:00] enoch took that body change but with all
[2:02] that's in me i believe the same dynamics
[2:04] that was there present with enoch to
[2:06] walk out of this world is the same
[2:09] dynamics that's here in the presence of
[2:11] his people because he promised i'll be
[2:13] there with you and if that condition was
[2:15] a hell on earth in enoch's day which it
[2:17] was satan's eden in full effect and he
[2:19] was able to leave one dimension to
[2:21] another i believe with all my heart the
[2:23] same dynamics is present with us not to
[2:26] just heal our bodies but to change the
[2:28] molecules from which we are in to take
[2:30] that other dimension very very soon
