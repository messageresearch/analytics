sister Sonia God bless you and anybody else visiting just and think of brother ch at this time and he's uh I guess if you if you've been in a a family where there's a a minister there's kind of like a bit of nerves going around and the attacks that come and go and it's it's not an easy life um so I just feel for brother CH he was saying before I left I think it's eight services in nine days that he's really going to be under pressure so we really just send my prayers especially for myself and you are sending yours I would just think of him at this time it's remembering those those ones and I think brother um Steve Golden's traveling today so we just pray for traveling mercies for those and those ones that are just listening in loving the Lord what can we say I'm a bit nervous I'm just calming down uh I've just got a simple word today but the the good thing about not being a preacher is that there's no comebacks so I'm just uh I'm just I I don't know why that that song touched me sister is it Rebecca yeah um because the seasons come and go and you know the gray hairs on the side of my head came I never thought I'd see him but I'm just thankful I don't look the prettiest never really did but um to the Lord we're the most beautiful thing we are trophies of his love and his grace and we're just thankful so if we could turn please if we would to um dra thank you musicians I forgot appreciate you John 21 if we could John John chapter 21 yeah just we we traveling back Lord willing on Wednesday morning and so just to say thank you as well for I I would say it's overwhelming love because uh I haven't really ever been loved like that before and I'm so thankful for you guys you know when the Lord changes you you become a different person and you no longer hang with the guys that you used to or the people you used to and yeah I'm thankful that I'm amongst people that the Lord's changed also so we appreciate each other it's not just the one way straight so it's a little bit of a I won't say a lengthy reading but we're going to read from 1 to 17 so John chapter 1 1 to1 17 if we could it says and after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiaras and on this wise he showed himself so for the kids on when it says on this Wise It's like in this manner he showed himself verse two there was together Simon Peter Thomas called dius Nathaniel of can in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples Simon Peter saith unto them I go fishing they say unto him we also go with thee then uh they went they went forth and entered into a shape immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but his disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus said unto them children have you any meat and they answered him no and he saith unto them cast the net on the right hand right side of the ship and ye shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto John it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he G his fish's coat upon Him unto him for he was naked and he cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from the land as it were 200 cubits so for the kids again a cubit is from there to there is so it's about 200 ft you can ask your dad later on how far that is dragon in N with fishes verse n and as soon as they were come to land they saw fires of coal there a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread Jesus said unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught Samu Peter went up and Drew the net to to land full of great fishes 115 and3 and for all they were so many yet was the not the net broken Jesus saith unto them come and dine now none of his disciples thirst ask him who art thou knowing it was the Lord Jesus then cometh and taking bread giveth them and fish likewise this is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead so when they had died Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yay Lord thou knowest I love thee he said unto him feed my Lambs he sayith unto again second time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him y Lord thou knowest I love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto you the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me pet was grieved because he had said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he saith unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him feed my sheep let's just pray over the reading of the word Lord Jesus we just come before you Lord just ask Lord that you bring something through the scriptures that you just encourage us Lord we love you Lord we just bless your name we say thank you Lord for all the things you do for us we love you Lord Jesus in your name we just come before you asking for your help amen amen you may be seated so sorry I think Blake would have just gently flipped the uh I I'll try actually you're never too old to learn sister Joyce as she as she picks up a tissue so this morning I just want to try and relax a little bit this morning it's more of like a I would say a kind of a Sunday school see the nice thing about the word of the Lord is that we can see something in the word of the Lord and we can use it as a type and a shadow and see just see the word see the word and that that's what kind of excites me is if you see something new so as I read the scripture a while ago um the thought came to me and uh I haven't spoken on it so I'm doing a Ben sorry but that's the good thing about not being a preacher I'm just sharing my thoughts with you sharing what blessed my heart um and the title for the sermon I'd like to say uh call it fishing on the right side fishing on the right side and um i' just like to begin with a with a quote from from um brother Ram he says and Jesus came it's 1957 way after the resurrection a disheartened little bunch of disciples had gathered together in different places at different places Jesus said well I'm just going to go fishing I'm so discouraged how could it be that the one that I seen called Lazarus from the grave how could it be um be when I stood there and seen the woman of name and her only son dead and he laid his hand on the boy and said young man arise I saw him come to life eyewitnesses seen Lazarus after being dead for 4 days his old grave clothes wrapped over his face and over his body he came forth from the grave I've seen him turn water to wine I've seen him touch the leper that was as white as snow and the Very blush of Health was in his cheeks in a few minutes how could it be that he could hang on a cross with the mockery Soldier spit on his face how could it be that he could lay his hands down and could drive Nails in his hand how could it be that he'd permit a crown of thorns to be pull down over his face and cross his feet and let them Drive spikes into his feet how could he stand there rolling a cat of Ninetails and split his back and ribs and was shining through how could he let them treat him like that how could he hang there between the heavens and the Earth and blood running from him and let those mockery priests his arch enemies walk by and Sass him how could he let a Roman soldier put a band around his head and hit him and say now who prophesies and who can tell forth tell us who hit you we'll believe you how could it be how could it be that he could let the high priest walk out there and say say come down off the cross if thou be Christ we will believe you how could it be that a great person like that who we believe to be the Son of God could ever go through such torment and Punishment as that and sit silent oh it was a dark hour the very Darkest Hour they hadd ever seen seeing them pull the nails out and see him bow his head and die and they take his body put it in Joseph Aria's grave how could it be when he seen the big rock laid up there and the the Roman seal put upon it how could it be he was so discouraged he said I just believe I'll go fishing and the disciples said well I'll go with you all night long discouragement they had pulled and caught nothing Jesus was gone it seemed like everything was gone they couldn't even as much as catch a fish right in the darkest of ours someone stood on the bank and said children have you any meat amen you know God I we like fishing but I've also been plenty of times when you catch nothing and you get discouraged you know our thought this morning is fishing on the right hand and I'm just praying that the Lord's just going to reveal a little bit of his word to us just encourage us because we need Revelation there's a song I think you guys sing give me more Revelation and that's what we need it's what keeps us going we need more Revelation you know if we can just turn the diamond of the word a little bit I like saying that expression I can actually start this makes me a bit more calm down I've got this drawn in in our little church there and it's basically supposed to be a diamond but the diamond there they got six little pieces to it but if you would turn the diamond it would kind of look similar all the way around and so we you know if if if you look at one side of the diamond here you can describe this piece but then when you're standing down the bottom here you can describe this piece and whoever's kind of looking up at this look you know you see it from this angle and then somebody up here and they're seeing it down from that angle and I'm not into somebody saying oh well you know the message means this because we're looking at it this way it's always got to match up with the word it's always got to be the word but we can see um a picture that helps us to see the word clearly and this is what I'd like to do today so now in verse three of this John chapter 21 we can read pardon me we see that John says I go fishing and if you remember Simon Peter he was actually a fisherman that was his that was his job and um we' like I'd like to just turn to that and just read that one as well it's quite important scripture turn to Mark Matthew 4 EXC excuse me you can hold your hand in there hold your hand in John 21 hold your hand in there and turn to Matthew chapter 4 and we're going to read 18 to 20 verses 18 to 20 it says and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew's brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishes and he said unto them follow me and I will make you fishes of men and they straight away left their Nets and followed him so we can see that they were fishermen we've got two things here that we can see we see that Simon Peter and Andrew Philip both they were fishermen okay of the natural the natural fish but now we see that the Lord here is pointing to a time when they will become fishes of men so if we notice the Lord Jesus says I will make you fishes of men follow me and I will make you fishes men so he's pointing to the Future because the Lord when he called Simon Peter and Andrew Phillip it's a time when the Lord had actually come to Israel we know the scripture it's John 1:11 um he came to his own in his own received him not so at this point in time um he came to his own so he's saying I will make you fishes of men pointing to a time in the future when they were not fishes of men natural now but they were going to be fishes of men so now we're back to John 21 by the way so when Simon Peter in verse three says I'm going to go fishing for him it's kind of normal that's his it is it's what he knows and sure he was supposed to go fishing you see but his own see the his own had rejected him as in the Lord Jesus his own they rejected him now so Simon Peter was supposed to be going fishing but not the fishing that he thought you reading between the lines you see the Lord's already right at the very beginning the very first time he lays eyes on Simon Peter he says give pack it in follow me and I'm going to make you fishes of men but so he was pointing for but they kind of missed it at that point in time and like us too many times get discouraged and they kind of fall back on the thing that they always used to do so now with his own strength with Simon Peter's own carnal strength he goes back to what he always does and he catches nothing and that's the quote we read There were how discouraged they were how discouraged they were and don't forget Simon Peter he's also denied the Lord he's denied the lord I can't even be a good Christian I can't I can't I'm so useless how many times do you know many times um many times we're all human beings we're trapped in this body and many many times we we we begin to feel like we're worthless you know and it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter if it's standing behind this Pulpit or song leading whatever it is you maybe walk down you've been song leading you think oh Lord I just what a mess I I I didn't say what I wanted to say I didn't I couldn't bring it and but it's CU we're in this flesh and we become down it's not he looks at us is how it's how we look at ourselves so now he's gone back and he's he catches nothing you know sometimes it's like that song the sister sang um about the seasons sometimes the Lord's got a season for us to go this way and He blesses our path and then suddenly the Lord turns us around and he's got something else for us and the Very fact that he's leading us to a different path means that he can no longer bless us going in this way and because his hand of blessing kind of comes off Us in carnal things in the things that we think meanwhile he's blessing this path here but because we're kind of a bit like donkeys we just want to keep going on we become discouraged meanwhile if we just turn our heads the Lord's got a door open for us on this side but oh no no I'm going to keep going and and you know brother Chad preached on religious reasons for things that was the first Wednesday we were here I think you know all the religious reasons that you make in fact was it last time I can't remember last time we what we make religious reasons so it's kind of like the I'm plowing ah head going this way and the Lord's showing me I'm going to go this way but not not the Lord showed me to go this way like 10 years ago now the plan's changed but no no I'm going to go this way and we keep plowing ahead and the way gets narrower and narrower and here the Lord's basically showing us to go this way but because we're plowing ahead this and then the road gets narrower life gets harder and then we remember all the quotes and the scriptures life's harder for Christian oh that's it I've got to be in the will of the Lord and you plowing ahead and then things get more difficult and it's like oh well you know Lord you know the way is narrow of scripture I yes I've course the narrow way and we just and meanwhile the Lord's just saying hey guys turn right see what I mean so now this is Simon Peter he's actually showed him right at the beginning that he's going to be fici of men now the Lord is actually wanting him now because now at this point in time um I would move it across maybe um I can do my little famous timeline so this would be time across here time across here and we're going that way and don't worry I've spelled it wrong but I can't UND do that and so here we have the cross here is time time is all the years and then here we've got uh the cross okay so now this on this side this side of the Cross okay the Lord Jesus calls Simon Peter now we're on this side of the Cross so now is the time that he's supposed to be the fishes of men plowing on down you know oh we're without fishing there's no it's it's it's a narrow way it's a narrow way it's it's got to be hard the way of a Christian's hard it's getting meanwhile the Lord's got something else for him sometimes we go back to something we fall back on something that we think we know how to do it some so Simon Peter now he feels discouraged to the one thing that he ever could do in life was the fish and he thought he knew how to do it so now he goes back to that sometimes we find our way in ourselves in that way sometimes we just stay in the comfort zone as brother Shay were talking the other day you know it's like sometimes we feel like we're going to stay in his comfort zone and the meanwhile the Lord's got something else let's read verse four and 5 if we could we're going to look at this scripture verse four and 5 it says but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not he was Jesus then Jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat you know it's really interesting he calls them children and I just want to look at this word children at this look at this word children if we can so this this word children we just move that to one side so the word here children CH children it's a Greek word and it means uh P pon pon okay that's that's what that's the Greek word so it means it means a child ling a child which is a child Ling here it's written childing it means half grown boy or girl so I'll just write half grown boy slir okay it means an immature Christian which I really like that IM mature sister Marin is in prayer right now Chris she's uh brother Gabe there's brother Gabe here he's preaching well yeah he um he doesn't capitalize the devil as well I that's me right it means a child and a damsel child and a damsel damsel okay and this is the word that we're just looking at here this this Christian immature Christian so the Lord uses the word it's very interesting he calls the disciples as he calls them in a manner using this specific word which means also an immature Christian so they're just starting out on the young in the word the the young they don't I mean they they don't they've gone fishing you're going to be fishes of men and they go fishing you know so so so the young you know we're not the only ones you know who who kind of grow in Revelation we're not the only one that it takes us so long to actually realize hangout and they put Penny drops ding he's like whoa you see these the disciples were the same Simon Peter's the same story and now the Lord's identifying them you know we're going through immature Christians we were immature Christians we're getting there and maybe there's some fresh one starting out but you know we're getting there slowly this this immature Christian but the Lord he asks them now he calls he says children immature Christians children have you any meat now I just want to draw this little picture for the kids it's for the kids it's only for the kids so we have a picture of the Lord Jesus this is a this is going to be a seashore around here and we've got the uh palm tree we've got the Lord Jesus standing here and the Lord is calling calling out what the Lord so we put the pillar of fire above him and here now we have these fish these fishermen okay and I'm not the best drawer believe it or not okay I promis pipper that I would also be drawing she really enjoyed it there's the water and you got the fishermen here on the top and they're holding there that's the Nets okay beautiful Beau so the Lord Jesus is on the seashore the Lord's calling to the disciples now notice we want we really want to catch this Revelation the fact that he's identifying them as as immature Christians he's not saying they're not a Christian he's just identify as their immature Christians and now we notice this is quite phenomenal really we notice how the Lord uses this word meat it uses meat and so we're going to zoom in on this word meat and you'll see why we're going here I'm going to move it to one side again and then we'll just write this word meat down here so this word meat that's written here in the English Bible meat is a Greek word it means Pro proos Fon Fon I probably spelled that wrong Pro Fon and it means something eaten something you'll see what we see where we're going later on something eaten in addition to bread and if you're spiritual you'll already be catching it right especially especially especially I think that's wrong but anyway fish okay and it means meat so it's this is one meaning of it and um this is the other it means meat meat I just spelled that wrong so meat that's it beautiful okay so so this word this particular word this this this this this PR fagon it's believe it or not this is used once in the whole Bible once this specific word is used once it appears once in the whole Bible and it's something in addition to be eaten with bread okay and we know that to eat something you know take the book and eat it to eat something means to be become one with this so to become one with the book to take the book and eat it become one with the book become one with the word and this word appears once and it's specific to what the Lord's saying here it's specific to this revelation we could say that we're going to that we're seeing in this word now notice it's also specific to fish so it's in addition ADV written forgive me that's my mistake here I wrote especially it's specifically forget that it's specifically spefically sorry specifically to fish it's specific the Lord is not just kind of everywhere with his thoughts on this so the Lord's pointing to it being specific so now we see the Lord is calling out which is back here on this one the Lord's calling out to his disciples and he says children pon don't you remember when I first called you this is just Simon putting in now obviously for those he says don't you know remember I said in the future you're going to be fishes of men in the future were you going to be fishes of men and now this is the time when you're supposed to be fishing for you're supposed to be going down this road but you're going down this road you're not supposed to be fishing for fish you're supposed to be fishing for Ben you know he children this this is this word pide on young Christians young immature Christians what are you doing you know you've gone out by yourself you're supposed to be fishes of men you know have you got any fish have you got any this this this Pro proon that's right have you caught something to go with the bread listen have you caught something to be to to that goes together with the bread the Lord said I am the bread of life he's searching for something amen that's going to go with his bread just read John 6:35 I'll read it if you want you right John it's just over the page I think John 6:35 John 6:35 the Lord Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst see the Lord is looking for fish but he's looking for specifically this pron meat to go with the bread of life yes verse 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for for the life of the world we can go back to John 21 so the Lord is specifically looking for something that's going to go with this bread this bread say amen I can say Amen that was exciting so now the Lord now don't forget the Lord already right at the beginning when the Lord first called these men he already called them to be fishes of men okay already you know from the very first moment he was calling them to hunt my bride he was calling them to catch my bride you know and because here now is the he is he is actually the the bread of life he's needing something to go with the bread of life he needs fish let's read verse 5 again in verse John 21 John 21:5 it says then Jesus said unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no so now I want you to catch this see they had their Nets on the left hand side I want you to it's so simple but it really it thrilled my soul but it's so simple they had their Nets on the left hand side on the left hand side of the boat why did they do that cuz they' always done it that way they'd always done it that way but you see they didn't particularly realize what was going on here they hadn't realized that now we've moved going to draw a dotted line which is going to be the this is time yeah and here is time here now I'm I'm putting this overlapping and here's the cross I'm going to do it in dark here is the cross they haven't realized that we've now moved over into a whole new dispensation okay they have they and and the Lord is now saying remember he's called them to catch fish fishes of men and now they're out fishing but you know on the left hand side well you know we're just going to do as we always did they haven't realized that now we've moved over into this new dispensation of time right and the fish that the Lord has called them to catch wasn't on the left hand side of the boat listen hey it wasn't on the left hand side the fish that he called them to was on the right hand side of the boat mate no longer are we supposed to cast the net into Israel into the left hand side of the boat but the fish that the Lord wants to go with his bread of life is on the right hand side of the boat M that's so simple but hey come on there's a a new dispensation new time changed and they didn't get it they hadn't caught on to it and so the Lord called he doesn't say they're not Christians he just says they're immature Christians there's nothing wrong with being immature Christian there's nothing wrong with the youngest kid and just just just just just praising the Lord and just being kids there's nothing wrong with that but there comes a time where we're called to something higher there's a new testament Bride on this hand side of the boat that's got to be caught mate the Lord's good see the word had come to the children of Israel the word had come they rejected him I'll read it John 1:11 John 1:1 he came unto his own and his own received him not the Lord came to his own he came he cast the net on the left hand side of the boat yeah he did it and they rejected him yeah but now the Lord is pointing him saying whoa whoa whoa uh what I put that thing there whoa um I don't know how this works to delete it anyway just forget this one big no no big no no cast that on the other side so now the Net's cast on the other side side the Lord is telling them he's pointing them in the right direction let's read John 21 go back to John 21:6 it takes the Lord to come personally he came personally to call him he told them what the future was going to be but now it how many times is that how many times any of you you feel a tug on your heart when you're young and then you kind of turn for a while and and maybe not but the Lord comes personally whoever in you have to put your hands up whoever in here has had a total life change absolutely tell me that the Lord didn't come personally to you personally see sometimes the Lord just comes personally let's read John 21 let's read verse 6 verse 6 and he said unto them cast the net on the right hand side on the right side of the ship and ye shall find what are they going to find listen he doesn't say have you got any fish normal fish he's asking have you got any fish specifically something that's going to go with my bread specifically he's asking them for a specific PR fagon I think that's the right word um yeah that's the one he's specifically looking for a specific fish the Lord's not talking about fish he's talking about fish fish if you know what I'm saying so verse six and s him casting it on the right side on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore now they were not able to draw for the multitude of fishes you see he points them to the right side of the ship it's the place where his fish are it's the place where the ones that he wants to catch that's where they are let's read uh Divine Healing 195 for brother I'm talking about the first Commission of the the apostles the first commission so this is just where he says he says what was the first commission he ever gave to his Apostles you like me to read to you it's found in the 10th chapter of Matthew Jesus commissioned his disciples said go out heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils as freely as you have received freely give Matthew 10th chapter is that right that's his first commission to his Apostles so we just want to read we want want to read that so turn to Matthew 10 if we could Matthew 10 Matthew chapter 10 and if we notice then as we read this we will see that the first commission that the lord gave was to the Jews it was to the left hand side of the boat yes see it was the left hand side so he says here we're going to read 5 verse 5 to verse 8 I think I've got written here 5 to8 says these TW uh Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not the way of the Gentiles or into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not hey guys go fishing don't throw it on the right hand side don't th so now we see another picture is that the guys are on the left hand side well this is what the lord always Tau us this is how he did it yeah but they haven't realized what's happened so so he tells them don't whatever you do do not I repat do not put the net on the right hand side the scriptures got to be fulfilled that I'm coming to my own okay so verse uh what do we say verse verse 5 to8 these 12 sent ye Jesus forth commanded them saying go not in the way of the Gentiles or in any way of the any city of the Samaritans enter you not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick claim the cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely ye have received freely give so we see now this specific commission the Lord's giving only go to the Jews and I said it before I'll say again the Lord's saying I repeat do not whatever you do not cast that net on the right hand side don't that's that side for you guys don't cast it on the right hand side only go to the Lost House of Israel do not go to the gentille he came to his own his own received him not okay should we once more brother what I'm saying cuz there's two now this is now the commission for after the commission now comes for after into the new dispensation so says once more 1963 he says so here we stand a church commissioned on the last commission the last thing that Jesus said to his church the last commission given go ye into all all the world see now no longer it's no longer going just to the Lost House of Israel now it's going to all the world if we were clever we might even just say well it's just a silly picture but you know the net on the left hand side has only got 200 cubits to sh the net on the right hand side is all the world you've got a fairish ocean to go out there and I've just done this and I don't know what I'm doing here oh here we go let me just uh okay where was I quote from that's it so it says go into all the world and Make Disciples of all Nations he that believeth um and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and in this and and is a and is a conjunction so basically brother I'm saying it ties it together to and is a conjunction to tie your sentence together and these things shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with you tongues if they take upstairs serpents or drink deadly things it will not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover so now we see there is another commission and this time we are casting the net on the right hand side of the ship that's this side for you guys okay and I want to read this scripture that brother M's just U mentioned here which is Mark chapter 16 Mark chapter 16 we a little bit in the scriptures but it's fine Mark chapter 16 and we will read 15 to 20 Lord Jesus and he said unto them go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature see it's no longer only to a certain group it's no longer to the old leftand side of the ship now we're not just going into into into the Cove small like a limited now it's just totally unlimited now now it's to the whole world says go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature verse 16 he that believeth and and he's baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and now this is what brother R says he says and the Seas and brother B puts in there that's where we read it he says it's to tie the sentence together these two things belong together so he says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall tape up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they sh shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken did I say 20 yep so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the the the Lord working with them and confirming the word word with signs following amen so if we notice as brother R says he says we stand he say brother says so here we stand a church commissioned on the last Commission Now if you when you kind of see who you are and what the role of the bride of Christ is which we're all we're all seeing now um you understand what he's saying here we've got the same commission amen not just here each one of us we stand here we stand a church commissioned on the last commission we have got a commission to cast The Net into all the world yeah to catch fish but specifically this PR fagon specifically so if we you move on a little bit now go back to John chapter 21 if we could John chapter 21 let's move on a little [Music] bit okay just read verse 6 to verse 11 and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple who Jesus loved said unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he G his fish's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from Land as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes uh to land uh and as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread and Jesus said unto them bring the fishes which ye have now caught Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to land full of great fishes 150 and three for they were all there and and for all there were so many yet the net was not broken amazing so we've seen how the net was cast on the left hand side and there was no fish the reason there was no fish is because the dispensation now changed and they' refused the Lord theyd refused the Lord there's no fish to be caught there but now that the Net's cast in on the right side in the right place place right this gospel net of Grace is cast into the right place it's so full that the net is almost breaking and if we notice there was only 153 fish there must have been really big fish you know I I actually took this out of my notes it's just you don't ever want to make the scriptures say something I I discussed this with a brother not not on this subject something else and he's an accountant down in London Brother David and he just he just loves the scriptures and we were just talking about um numbers he's into like numerology and things which is awesome You See It All Through the Bible and he says and and I just said oh I I think I was preaching on Simon being discouraged or whatever once down in down there and and and he said oh he said you know 153 I said you know there's not many fish 100 it's actually not many and so we looked at this 153 and and we were discussing certain things he said you know he said somewhere there's a scripture that talks about 153 I was like okay fine anyway you messaged me I wasn't going to read it but 2 Chronicles 2 Chronicles I think it's second chonicles 2 because we're looking look we're looking at we're seeing this picture and for me that's why I like to say it's like the diamond we just turn the diamond I'm not trying to bring some weird something else you turn the diamond you just seen something this is the first time I'd seen this and it's like it's encouraging and it fits with the word it fits with the picture it's like yes but we're looking now the casting the net on the right hand side it's Gentiles Gentiles yes did I say the word Gentiles yes okay read 2 Chronicles 2 this is the scripture that he sent me verse 17 is awesome I like it and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel pause look up look up Richie a stranger in the land of Egypt is defined as what Gentile stranger in the land now you can put your head down and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the of Israel after the numbering where with David his father had numbered them and they were found 150,000 and 3,600 153,000 and 600 so there's 153 again and it's also in relation to Gentiles so 153 this time it's not 153 it's 153,000 and the 600 but you've got that 153 so on a sliding scale it's see what I mean it's just a nice type I like it back to John 21 but notice these 153 fish now they they they it's not a big number but they were great fishes it says in the Scripture it says they were great fishes we've been we've been fishing a few years ago we went it was the most ridiculous fishing trip we've been on up on out on the sea on a charter with with the Brethren from another church they organized it we just came back we got the feed bags you know the feed bags for the for the corn we came back with two of those full and every brother I mean we've got hundreds but like just in a few bags and they were like mackerel the point is is that 153 fish would fit into if they were normal like they' fit into a couple of bags so what's special about these fish because it almost broke the net you see in the fish in the natural 153 yeah it sounds like a lot and if you they've got to be big ones to break the net you imagine how SI the size of their fishing nets they weren messing about they were professionals he's almost breaking the net so they were huge fish these fish that the Lord C trust me if the Lord is trying to type to them stop casting in the left hand side cast in the right and then that's where you're going to find him you're not going to find him in the Old Testament anymore guys you're not going to find it oh yeah but we've always gone to the synagogue and the priest so he's done the work yeah yeah but now I've asked you to do it yeah but but but no buts goats but check it out go to the right hand side so now we go to the right hand side now suddenly there's these fish and the Lord's trust me he's not going to let them catch fish that come like this trust me they're going to be like stunning fish they're going to be huge you know the the Lord is catching them now we're on the right hand side he's using these five-fold Ministries he's using everything he's using his body every single thing um the testimony the sister uh that's beautiful you know with the de seizure it's beautiful see that see maybe the sister seeing there thinking oh why why why did I have to go through that all them years why didn't the Lord hear me earlier because you've got to be that testimony so you go through that all that time now suddenly you've got this testimony everyone around can see it you tell a testimony and that is you throwing the net out that's you the Lord is using you to catch the greatest fish of all the Lord is good you know we've got a part to play each one of us you see now we see the Lord he started the ball rolling the Lord is the one who started all he's the beginning he was the beginning he was that Cornerstone he's our foundation notice in ver in verse n when we look at verse 9 it says as soon as they were come to land they saw fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread I've got a question do you think the Lord out fishing Gathering wheat and beaking no just like bread fish that's it done see so the Lord supernaturally starts it going right he starts the work I could draw it for the kids I suppose for the kids so here we have a little fire these are supposed to be sticks and here we've got a big fish on top this is the one that the Lord Jesus caught and there's Flames flying up okay and there's a nice loaf of bread there that's like supposed to be a loaf of bread the Lord say now the Lord starts the work the Lord's the one who where did the 12 disciples come from it came from him he's the one who starts the work and he's they come to find the work already started he's pointing them where to catch the fish and then he turns around and says now you bring of the fish that you've caught Amen Brother John you bring of the fish that you've caught see what I mean Kyle everyone everywhere you go you're casting that net out to people and one day one day the Lord will say bring up the fish that you've caught and believe me you will you don't even know what you're doing yes you're just living your life nobody notices me I'm just driving me forklifting brother Richie oh I'm just I'm just in my office you know no no it's unnotice whoa whoa whoa you might think so but one of these days it's you will see the fish that brought in through you that the Lord used you the Lord is still the one who draws the fish but he's got a net that he uses am he's got a way of doing it he's using his body he's using you and he's using me he's casting the net out over all these years casting the net casting the net casting the net in the in the for Cliff Factory Crown is it Crown I don't know what it's called I can't remember I've seen the truck go by Brother um priest Paul isn't it casting the net there wherever you working brother ammanuel casting the net down there casting the Lord's using all these things constantly sister joice what can I say you know and and and the people in the old old people's home every day the Nets being cast out oh nobody notices me no no you just think that and if there was no one here to tell you different you'd say I'm going fishing yeah You' also get discouraged because we don't see behind the picture we can't see what the Lord's truly doing the Lord has given us a commission he's commissioned us to go into all the world he's commissioned to cast the net on the right hand side of the ship let's read Mark 16 I want you to read that again Mark 16 let's read this commission once more Mark 16 and we're going to read verse 15 and verse 16 verse 15 and verse 16 the Lord Jesus says this is for you he says go ye into all the world I've got a question for you if you want to turn around and say oh that was only for the disciples I'm going to ask you a question how do the disciples go into all the World by themselves can't be so it's got to be someone I yes it was the it was the the seven Messengers yeah as well but even brother B he's not here now so someone's got to carry the message someone's got to do the work and the Lord's got a way of doing it the Lord never changes his way of doing things once he sets he says I'm doing it this way he's going to do it this way when he commission the disciples go you go and you I'm going to make you fishes of net I'm sorry Shay Wherever You Are you're going to be catching them fish police the police whatever it is when I say I'm sorry sh that means that's it's you as well you know he's called he's he's the policeman that that's just got a bit more compassion than anyone else do you know what I mean it's like we're living that life each one of us I just want to read verse 15 verse 16 again and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned you know yesterday I was turning my scriptures and this dropped out you all know what this is it's it's a it's it's A1 $1 note and I picked it up and it was at a time when um i' just been to um brother Franco and Sister Amy been to their place and she was telling about oh you know sometimes with the Chads just says oh you know 9: at night and and the direction changes he like oh what are we going to do I get that as well and I was just thinking Lord please no she not spoken to me please but late last night I just thought oh Lord which which which way and I opened my Bible and this fell out it was a $1 note now you all know it I'm not going to go all like Technical and look at all the arrows and the 13 stars and the pyramid and all that no no on the front there's an inscription and it says this note is legal tender for all debts put public and private I was like boom that's it I thought wow this word is legal tender to cover all debts public and private all debts are covered by this one it's amazing I just saw I saw it I thought you know this is our net that we're casting out but you know it's in word form still but it's also in flesh form so that's why I say wherever you are you are that net being cast out amen we are the these written Epistles with this written word and you are displaying the fact that that this legal tender this one is Illegal Tender for all debts public and private I just thought that's amazing that's what this gospel is the gospel is the legal tender that will cover all our debts it's if you give that to any sin that you've got you lay that on the table and it's covered it's done you know the gospel the message of Grace this message that we carry is freely we've received it freely give tell me how our commission is different to the commission the lord gave the first disciples other than being on the right hand side of the ship we got it freely we didn't do nothing for it he gave it to us and we're just saying look take the money just take it just take it cover the debt it's done that's what we're doing and that's what our life is our life is reflecting that you know there's a price that's been paid for everything and you know we are these written Epistles we are the word of God listen an epistle for the kids is it's a letter right so if you look if you read through the Bible and you go to the first the first book of of Mark it's The Gospel According to Mark and you read the Ephesians go to Ephesians that's an easier one it says the official the Epistle of Paul to the Apostle of the Ephesians and it goes on through it's an epistle it's a letter it's written it's a written form of something so if the scripture tells us that we are written Epistles read of all men then you are walking Living Word of God am I stupid did I say that wrong no that's what it is so so if we are written we are the word made flesh we word the word displayed in flesh you know and and and we are displaying the the resurrection power of the lord we are witness we are um we are proof of his resurrection the fact that we live ye I live the you shall live also he's telling us that and now the fact that we're here and we're alive and it's a paradox because yeah we're dying but we're alive we're die we're dead but we live we live but but we're alive we can't die the realist can't die we we are proof of his resurrection you know the world will see him and only can see him in a bride form now and the light of the Lord the light of his word which moves on moves on is it's him in her it's him in her it's it's the Lord just taking on flesh again you know the Lord the Lord just picked up dust and spoke to um to Abraham the Lord picked up dust he stands in anyone and the Lord p stand picks up your dust and he's standing in you and it's this gospel net that's always being thrown out you want to read this I think it's the last quote Christ is the mystery of God revealed and I'm going to it's paragraph 591 595 and 611 I'm just going to read the highlighted bits it says the headship and the we know all this the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifest in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain they're one God and his church is one Christ in you God's Great Revelation glory to God even bearing his name his name is Jesus the anointed see if we're the anointed bride then how we've we've taken on his name we've taken on his name we are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ paragraph 595 is the whole paragraph uh and the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it it's the same word nothing can be added or taken from so the same word that moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one the husband sorry they are they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know it it Bears the same record the same fruit the same word see it manifests Christ the same life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same signs the things that I do shall you you also oh my Hallelujah listen and then you sit there and you yes but I don't have the spirit of discernment and you walk away you're not called to so what you can do go fishing no but there's others around here look you know oh but I'm not called to preach so the preacher not called to play the guitar like brother John and brother Steven and Josiah you know they they they're ministering in a different way but we're all part of this body it's all part of the same gospel it's all part of the message it's all part of the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh just in different parts of it's a God manifesting himself through uh 611 we're not all called we are not all called and the Lord the word comes to the prophet you know I said the the the the um the uh the Lord doesn't change his way of doing things when when when the people said no no no no don't let God speak let let let a man speak the Lord says well that's fine I'll do that from now on hence the word of the Lord only comes to the prophets so yeah we can take this word but the word comes to the prophets I'm thankful we've got a prophet in our day that the Lord came to spoke his word and we can carry that on and now we can open and we can see clearly holding the two things together I'm thankful paragraph 611 I can read the whole paragraph So that because I've just highlighted the middle piece H's Church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing listen I want you to catch this the church is ident identified he was listen he was identified by um he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing amen she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days so look the Lord Jesus is identified being the body that God dwelt in okay and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing remember all that God was according to Christ all that Christ was according to the church we the church are standing here with this commission he's chosen us to continue that work he's chosen us to continue throwing the net out to the world the lord is you know the Lord has chosen to show the world to show himself to the world through his bride we see it in the type of uh King aah Horus and yashi was it yashi or something y yeah that one she's not worth mentioning really well you know the Lord wanted to put on sorry the Lord aurus wanted to put her on show and she was like yanah so he said Yana and got another one see what I mean so the you know cast on the left hand side of the ship and she says yanan so he's like okay Y and I'll get one that's worthy then comes Queen Ester see what I mean one that one that the Lord can show off one that the Lord can can put the the clothes with the clothing the righteousness of of of his word he can clothe her in that and he can say this to the world this is it this is the one see see he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in the church is identified by his body doing the same thing see what I mean mate see we are the word made flesh you know the scripture says the Lord says no man lights a candle and then covers it puts it under a bushel nobody the Lord the king hosah Horus didn't call for a queen to have a queen and then just say will you now go and hide in the back no no no no no no he wants the queen to be on show because don't forget I don't want to get into it because we'll be here hours but listen the glory of the man is the woman amen the glory of the man is the woman is it any different for Christ than the bride no so he wants to show his bride he's chos it's the place he's chosen to show you know the scripture um the glor um the the sufferings of this world is not to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us it's a scripture there's this Glory there's this there's this there's this there's this showing off the glory of God through his bride and the Lord is not going to hide us under a little candle a little a little bushel and you know the Lord the Lord didn't let brother Chad just carry on doing what he wanted to do no no you no he put him on show you know and I just want to stay on my little farm and just like be myself but we a got Choice have we we can't we've got to do what he calls us to the Lord is good remember the Lord started the work there was these fish that the Lord Jesus did at the bottom here he started the work and then he hands over okay he hands over to his disciples the ones that he's chosen to continue his work okay to cast the net on the right hand side and then he says he says now you bring of the fish that you've caught so there is a fish to be brought in through S still one the Lord's good you know I just see you know little s sisters and I just see them when you talk to them and you know brother mik sister El you talk to them and and the testimonies and you see all these ones and and then you see like a little old sister and sister Karen and I'm out names cuz I'm everyone's thinking wow and sister rain wrong one this is Sister rain sister Lan these little sisters you start to see the Lord like everything that comes out listen everything that comes out of her artwork she does artwork do she a Phenom it blow me blow me away but you see that the artwork that she does it's like everything in it is like giving off this reflection of the Lord and I'm not lifting a sister oh sister no no no I'm just I'm I'm really touched by it because there's also Believers Believers in theory believers who who do artwork and there's a kind of dark side to it you know what I mean and I'm just like well I don't know about what's going on here and then you see somebody who's truly reflecting through the music and through the life you can see what is that see we're not the only people that see that and if they're out there in the world and say well he's just a weirdo well that's for them they'll be judged on that but what is it sure he's a weirdo to you cuz you don't know what you're doing you don't know you know you don't know from down but the lord it's this Glory that's being reflected and the glory isn't just some fancy fancy schmancy it's just this this radiation of of godliness we're thankful for that you know the Lord is still fishing but now the net he's using is the word it's the message how are people going to see the message or hear the message he's using you he's using you we are read seen and read of all men yes you know our our life is this gospel net to all men and so we have to remember uh the importance of living right there there is an importance of living right we have to live correctly walk circumspectly you know and we're talking not just not just on a Sunday on a Wednesday through the week we have to act and do we've got to live that life it's it's it's very important listen if we if we are the final voice to the final age if if we believe that then that means a second I'm a bit thick so final Voice final age to me that means it's the last one right does that mean mean that there's no more after us on so if we don't live that life on how is anybody going to see what actually God's anything about how is anybody going to see if we don't walk in the light as he is in the light it's oh yes if we walk in the light as he's whoa whoa whoa if we walk in the light as he is in the light sorry oh yes looking at brother RAM and brother R's life that's that's nice but you've got to live that same life you've got to walk in that same life the the the um the uh uh what's the word I'm looking for um sacrifice the sacrifice that he had to lay down you got to do the same thing yes but I'm not called to it if you part of the body you've got to be because who's going to speak to the little old lady that that sister Lan lives next door to or who's going to be in the old people's or who's going to be in the workplace who's going to do it oh well well well well okay fine fine listen if we're the final voice to the final age that means there's no one after us that means that you see this see the high calling of Christ the high priest it's something different than what we think yeah everybody wants to be I think I mentioned it last time I don't think you understand what I was talking about I said oh everyone wants to marry the king but nobody wants to bake the cake and everybody at home knows what I'm talking about but basically the king Everybody Wants to Marry The King and the King's got his favorite cake which would be Raspberry Pi yeah and everybody wants to marry the King right oh can you make me a raspber pie so well actually I like I like blueberry muffins the king's yeah yeah but my favorite Cake's like raspberry piie so yeah yes well you've got to watch your waistline oh I didn't ask that I just wanted a raspberry cake a raspberry T but you see everybody wants to marry the king but nobody wants to be his favorite cake see what I mean so everybody wants to be I ask we the bride of Christ wo whoa wo then live the life yes well I think I'll leave that little bit out thank you very much fine just shows who you are the king the king will just get another one as it were you know all you're actually not called to be see we have to live that life who else is going to see the word and read the word in your life if we're not here or if we live shut up in a box in a jungle cuz I mean I mean I'm be honest with like when I was younger I thought does does people second world war didn't really affect like maybe daily life like it did us as much I know it did but for us it goes deep as English U and I heard about um those families that had felt the leading of the Lord I guess um before the um first and second world war and they moved out to Siberia in Russia I mean you can it's like car drive like 5 weeks and you'll be in the middle of it it's it's just so huge it's just huge and no one lives there I think it's called the tundra is it the tundra that's it yeah Tundra not Siberia Tundra right and these families moved there lived there and they lived through the first world war and the second world war they never even knew anything happened and after all these like like couple of generations down whatever it was they came back to reality was like mate what's going on here but they just literally the family probably believing believing family felt to move out there and so you're talking like they never even knew the first world war or the second world war even happened and I used to think as a young Christian I used to think you know I could live out there maybe brother Brown was thinking the same thing you know what I'm saying up to Alaska with family and with the kids and just just leave it foret maybe it's the same thing I felt the same way I thought you know if we could just go up to the tundra somewhere you know just just live and just hunt and just just be imagine you don't you don't have to ask anyone where to live you just live you don't have to buy a house you don't have to get a mortgage you don't have to have money you just live like oh I'm hungry let's go and get a deer let's go fishing or something it's just but then who's going to who's going to see Christ through me see this is the whole bushel in the candle thing sometimes we want to just go fishing sometimes we just want to I just just go just just hide somewhere and the Lord's got a different plan for us because if we're the final voice to the final age then how is anyone going to see us if we're up in tundra you know what I mean how is it going to work the world will not not read the Bible forget it America is probably the number one Bible reading nation in the world you say laugh and say no believe me you are all you got to do is drive down to Cincinnati you know what I'm saying like 50 foot signs everywhere so they're reading the Bible but not reading the Bible so no one's going to actually physically pick up the Bible and read it with any intent of learning anything so how are they going to know what's right and wrong how are they going to know they'll only see it through you through you they will see it and you know it'll come down to only those that are foreordained to see it will see it see don't forget we're throwing the net out and the Lord is watching over who comes into that net I'd like to read to Second Corinthians if I could second Corinthians and it's verse chapter 12 chapter 12 so 2 Corinthians 12 second Corinthians 12 and we'll read 15- 19 15- 19 Paul says and I will very gladly spend and be spent for you though more abundantly I love you the less I beloved but be it so I did not burden you neither nevertheless being crafty I caught you with Gile I like this did I make Gain of you by any of them who I said unto you I desire Titus and with him I sent a brother did Titus make Gain of you walk not we in the same Spirit walk we not in the same steps again think he that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before God in Christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying so notice here Paul describes the way that he is living his life sister Joyce he catches them with Gile and I'm pict see Joy because you know she's the first one that I can see him she's always smiling so it's like you know I really feel a burden to talk to um sge so it's like how are we going to do it well it's a birthday let's just slide over there and bring our favorite cake and maybe just slip a little scripture on the bottom or use my favorite little dish that when she's eating the pie in the bottom it's got a scripture repent and be baptized but she knows that you know everybody after they've had a nice pie they're going to be a bit Dopey they're going to be like ooh what's this the point is it's catching people with Gile craftiness the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 6 10:16 he says be wise as serpents harmless as doves now we know that at that point in time he he the Lord Jesus is in fact we'll read it quickly just just CU to get to make sure that you're understanding uh Matthew 10:1 16 Matthew 10:16 Matthew 1016 so yeah that's right so remember the Lord Jesus he's sending them out into he's actually sending out into the left hand side of the ship okay and he says behold I send you forth a sheep into the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise a serpent and harm as doves so now when we go out into the world yeah we're going out into wolves but we don't know if there's a sheep there see so we have to be so yeah although this is he's sending them out knowing that they're going into wolves I'm not saying the reason I've said this is otherwise you're going to be when you go out there and you cast your NS to Joyce you're going to be like I'm going to make this cake but she's a wolf and you're going to put it on the thing and walk back cuz you don't want to get bitten the point is we don't know who's who but we still got to be wise as serpents harmless as doves you just got to be loving be kind we don't know you know we don't know where the fish are we just C the net we don't know who the bride is and who not we just cast a net but one thing we know that there will be a bride and it'll the Nets will be bursting but they won't break yeah there'll be so many 153 fish is not a massive number but it's quality that the Lord's looking for the Lord is looking for quality and remember the third pool was to cat the big fish you know the the the the quality and you know you could say I'm not going to get into the fishing techniques but brother Jack will tell us that one but it's like you know if you want to catch certain fish you got to stick certain bait on the hook you know what I mean I know how to catch trout that's about it you know I'm not I'm not I'm not you know I just if I go somewhere else oh we're going to catch crappy whatever they are it's like okay fine just use this and this it's like okay fine you know oh we're going to catch sge who she likes the raspberry Tarts yep you know what I mean oh you know brother John's going to catch it Nathan whoever he works with whatever he is oh yeah he likes this and this and this well what are you going to do brother Brown did the same thing go and look at cars oh are the good cars oh real good cars yeah yeah you know about convention you know he is he goes on talks about if you if it's a farmer talk about crops if it's a mechanic talk about brother richy talk about technical machines I don't have a clue what they are but he looks good and just sit there and Nod and say yeah brother brother Richie they're good machines then slide it push it make it look like you know what you're doing I don't do you see what I'm saying it's like this this is a craftiness it's not like a a nastiness it's just being clever it's actually following the lead in the spirit the Lord has called this quality bride and I could put it on here I suppose because this has stayed still now for quite a while uh and we run out of time uh run out of space here as well so here on this timeline here you know as time goes on we have here this is the uh the cross here we have one 2 3 4 five six so we've got these six one 2 3 4 five six and then uh that's it seven so the point is we've got these seven Church ages that are along here so this is the time now this suddenly becomes a timeline the next cast on the right hand side and we are in this seven Church ages and in every single age I think I think I I read the quote um last week it's where um it's I think it's the church age book uh and and the Lord and brother B is bringing out how that in each ch that Luther was the voice of God to the lutherans and Wesley was the voice of God he was the Living Word to the to the to the wesan movement and you are the last final voice to the final age so we have we have moved through these seven Church age and we are speaking the word we are casting the net out we are calling those for this church age but all the way through the bride you know there is there is these seven Church ages of fish that's been caught and all together they will make up this huge number of the Bride amen each one I'm going to come to a close musicians would you come I'm probably the shortest sermon we preach for a long time could the musicians come we'll just slowly close I want to read verse uh John 21 again please you know looking at our our commission what we have to do John 21 we're going to read verse three and 4 John 21 Simon Peter to saith unto them I go a fishing they say unto him we go also with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but his disciples knew not that it was him listen notice how they fished through the night see that they fished all through the night the Lord had it in such a way that that that these disciples were out on the boat and they were fishing through the night it was dark it was the Old Testament typing we we're typing it the Old Testament they were fishing in the wrong place the Gentiles had no chance in the Old Testament no chance there was no Grace for us but when the morning was come amen when the morning was come you know we're into this new day here look here so we can see here zoom in look here see this this this new this new day here into this new day okay and here is very this this point here is where the Lord Jesus is standing on the shore so we suddenly we're into this new dispensation we're into this new day and now suddenly we have Grace suddenly we can be caught there's a new day that's dawned it's the beginning of the Bride age it's the beginning of all these seven Church ages it's the beginning of the Lord calling his fish this Pro this this word something that goes together with the bread it goes and it's used remember it's used once specific it's for this spread the new day brought a change the net was suddenly cast on to the right side the Lord's good and finally the Gentile bride could be caught in this net of grace and the net it's been casting out now for 2,000 years so this whole this whole seeven uh uh seven seven seven um Church ages the seven Church ages is actually in in years it's it's 2,000 so from here from here to here it's actually 2,000 years so it spells out 2 days we know we know the script I don't want to get into it but it's like it's like we get into it if you want okay this is 2,000 years this this this whole uh this whole um age here this is 2,000 years so this is uh here and then we've got here we've got uh what's this what am I doing is it uh this is uh wait 2,000 years right so I need to start back here so this is uh I'm working back 1 two three 4 okay so this is I've got I'm terrible at m one two I can I can always zero this is Adam and Eve A and E okay that's not good that means accident that's like your emergency room I think you call it in England A and E okay fine well that's where it all happened and that's when the first Band-Aid was put on so boom okay so this is uh 1,000 years okay this is 2,000 years 2,000 years this is 3,000 years this is 4,000 years okay this is 5,000 years and this is 6,000 years okay so we're at the end of the sixth day and here in the here we have Noah's AR here okay Noah AR and there's Noah okay and here we have the cross in the middle we've got that already L yeah and we are right here so it says there in the prophecy in Joel it says in the last days I will pour out my spirit yeah okay and so for the young ones who kind of like you know a spirit the Holy Spirit is the life of God so we look in the scriptures and we can read and it says um it says he gave the ghost you know he gave the ghost I think maybe Anan and zapir for example fall at Peter's feet and give up the ghost so a ghost is a life right so it's like the Holy Ghost is the holy life it's it's God's Life Ghost spirit it's all the same thing so Holy Ghost holy spirit is God's own life okay so the prophet Joel um um Joel 2 we can read actually Joel 2 is it Joel 22 28 I think somebody might have to shout out and help me here where are we Joel where are we go find Joel out where are we Joel Joel 2 that's it Joel 2:28 that y says it and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see visions and all also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and then we go to Acts 2 I just off the top of my head this hopefully is Right Acts 2 I'm sure it is oh Acts 2 if we could uh and it's Acts 2 Peter that's right in verse 14 see now now no longer Peter is uh fishing for uh Peter's not fishing for fish no more when we get to Acts 2 he ain't fishing for fish no more he's fishing for the fish fish okay so it says here in verse 14 but Peter standing up with the 11 have you got it yeah Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and then and then now he quotes in verse 17 what Joel said and it shall come to pass in the last days days last days sayith God I will pour out my spirit my spirit my life as we swap over into this new just ation I'm going to pour out my life and my life is going to fill the church okay my spirit upon All Flesh and your son and daughter should prophesy and young men should see visions and old men should Dre dreams right okay I've got a question for you so here when you get to number four between number four and number six right is that one day or two days there's a scripture that says uh you might have to help me now um be be be not be not deceived a days is a thousand years and a thousand years is a day which scripture is that I don't I w't read it you know it's the scripture it's telling us that a day in the eyes of the Lord is a thousand years so how many days have we gone past now oo we're at the end of the sixth day if we would zoom in on number six there right we are on day six we are about here it is the evening time it's later than you think it's gone past here if we would look at this as a day it's like if this is a clock okay a clock and it's hours okay then we've got 1 2 3 4 5 and this is 12:00 here midnight and we're like 11:58 we're right there right so that's at the end of the last day but here now we have got since the Lord began we've got six days but here it says that the spirit is not going to fall on All Flesh notice All Flesh not just on the smaller side of the sea but on the big side of the ocean on the right hand side my spirit is going to fall on All Flesh right in the last days and there's s on the end isn't there so it's not the last day it's the last days so if a thousand years is one day then we've got had six days right um is that right right so if it's days there has to be two days right so that's going to be days am I right is this right the last days so that is now at the point where the Lord where the dispensation changes over suddenly we're into the last days now notice it doesn't say day it says days so when the spirit of P fell on the day of Pentecost and the Lord suddenly indwell his bride in flesh this is the beginning of the calling in of the 50 153 fish this is the call this is the beginning of the casting out the net and pulling that net in this is the beginning of Christ notice he didn't pour out his Spirit on All Flesh before only in the New Testament only his bride the Net's been going out for 2,000 years now in my spirit I'll the last days but the Net's not going to break the Net's getting full but it's not going to break and our commission each one of us is to live this life of Christ and you know we're written Epistles we are written Epistles I just want to find this this this dollar note again whever it is I better find it cuz that's my ticket home I can't find it oh good there there we go right see we are written Epistles and on here this is a written epistle this is a written this is a written proof it's a written document and this is actually for real and if we weren't all bankrupt we could go and say I want Donald's $1 worth of gold and they would give it to you in theory so the point is this is a this is a written document this is a written an epistle and it's showing you that when I give this to you like this is going to cover your debt it's a written epistle and you know we've got a written epistle we have got a written epistle to show that this will cover your debt that this one has come to judge the world and this one will cover your debt we've also got this written epist we can also hold it up we can say this is legal tender this is legal tender and will cover your debt it will cover your debt public or private whatever you whatever we've done in public the Lord will cover it whatever we've done in private the Lord will cover it it's covered you know the Lord's good I I I just trust and I hope that my broken up message and thoughts everywhere and I just trust that we can just see something I was thrilled when I saw you know that the right hand side the left hand side what you can see what the Lord shows us in type form he's trying to get through to us what's going on on and Acts chapter 2 verse 14 now suddenly Peter's got no more questions suddenly he's not wanting to go fishing anymore I don't I haven't looked but I don't think he'll find him going fishing becoming a fishing no more no no no he's realized his commission he's realized what the Lord's called him to do he's the Penny's dropped he's going for it and the Lord he's he's he's he's called us he's lifted us up and now the Lord's cleaned us like justification sanctification he took us and he bought us with a price he paid the debt he's cleaned us up and he's using us for his glory to show forth the Praises of him as the scripture says you know the Lord after after the Lord um called them there was the there was the fish on the fire already suddenly the Lord commands them to feed his sheep to feed his lambs and the reason we see um Peter feeling so despondent is because oh Lord I love you yes sure yeah and then he remembers that he denied him once Saints don't ever let the devil tell you that you failed once before and that you can give up don't ever let the devil tell you that don't ever let the devil oh yeah yeah yeah oh do do you love oh Lord I love you I love you and then and then you kind of remember the time when you kind of just lost faith a little bit and the devil trust me he'll hone and say yes look at you you remember Sister colen when you were you know doubting a little bit see what I mean that's not the Lord first thing is to identify the Lord identified I'm just zooming on the class off C there and brother um uh don't tell me Chuck how can I forget Chuck I love Chuck it's like it's like you know the the the devil will honing on that and you see how the Lord he didn't call your Sinners no he didn't he just called them immature chran Christians he just identified where they were in their walk with the Lord and it's just like no no you're just a bit immature yet don't worry you'll get there you know and he calls I have you any me no you're doing the wrong thing cast it on the other side you know in our life you know sometimes we we we we get we feel down it doesn't take much for us it doesn't believe me it doesn't take much just a word just take somebody to just say something and that's it you're on the floor I'm going fishing you see and it's it's important that we recognize the spirits of sister Cen she'll she'll she'll she'll recognize the spirit on the choke and and she'll say oh honey I just feel so so upset and this and he'll say that's not the Lord like whoa you know you're immature Christians it's fine don't worry he's not telling you you're a sinner he's not he's just saying don't worry that's not the Lord identify he identified their condition and so it's important that we listen to our Brethren who the Lord is using to give us strength to strengthen one another that we listen and when they say you know don't worry it's it's it's it's it's not that's not the lord it's just the devil trying to bring you down happens to all the time even the kids the kids SCH ad that's not that's not the Lord what and she like yes it's just like Ah that's so true you know that's so true and just keep pressing on you know every testimony and every sermon is strengthening us amen we hear
