[0:00] it'd be a shame an absolute shame
[0:04] to have a home
[0:05] that's contrary to the word
[0:09] and expect our kids to be born again in
[0:12] the church service or at a camp
[0:17] when we have a we have kept them in the
[0:19] wrong atmosphere for how many years
[0:23] kept them in the wrong atmosphere
[0:25] entertained by the wrong things with the
[0:27] wrong kinds of discussion going on in
[0:29] the wrong attitudes
[0:32] and we expect that they can get a
[0:35] two-hour exposure to the right
[0:36] atmosphere that will wash out the weeks
[0:39] of bad atmosphere that we have in our
[0:41] home
[0:44] see we deceive ourselves by not getting
[0:46] in god's program we think god's just
[0:48] always going to cover it it's always no
[0:50] god has told us what to do and god is on
[0:52] partnership with man and he's given us
[0:54] instructions if we'll just do what he
[0:56] told us to do he'll do the part that we
[0:58] can't do
[1:01] what a shame it is the thing that we can
[1:04] send our kids to a youth meeting
[1:06] and that there the seed will come to
[1:08] life but at home we have arguing we're
[1:10] fussing we have criticism about amen
[1:13] others in the church
[1:16] amen we don't fully apply the token in
[1:18] our home we don't take what the prophet
[1:19] taught us but we mingle we mix
[1:23] we allow things he told us to throw out
[1:25] of our house
[1:26] we bring in things that he told us not
[1:28] to have
[1:29] we discuss things that are not godly
[1:32] and that's the atmosphere that that
[1:34] little seed has to sit in all the time
[1:36] and we wonder why sometimes they
[1:38] struggle and they struggle and they
[1:39] struggle i say god help us to create the
[1:42] right atmosphere at least help us to do
[1:44] our part if i've got the holy ghost in
[1:47] me i should be able to create a holy
[1:49] ghost environment in my house
[1:53] we should be able to create the right
[1:54] environment in our fellowships we should
[1:55] be able to create the right environment
[1:57] in our church services we should be able
[1:59] to create the right environment in our
[2:00] homes
[2:02] and if we can then we trust god to do
[2:05] the part that we can't do
[2:08] but
[2:09] i believe we need to be conscious of
[2:11] these things
[2:12] so much we just keep
[2:15] putting stuff over on god
[2:17] god you do this and you do this and you
[2:20] do that and god says but i sent a
[2:22] prophet in this day to teach you how to
[2:24] do that
[2:26] i taught you how to talk to your
[2:27] children i taught you how to have family
[2:29] devotions that family alter i taught you
[2:32] how to come into the church and create
[2:33] an atmosphere i taught you why do we
[2:35] keep shoveling off on god when god so
[2:38] graciously brought a prophet in our day
[2:39] to give it to us
[2:43] i say god
[2:45] teach me
[2:47] teach me god
[2:49] forgive me
[2:50] lord and teach me
[2:53] teach me how to let that spirit flow
[2:55] through me
[2:57] teach me how to change the atmosphere in
[2:59] my home teaching me how to speak
[3:02] positive instead of negative how to
[3:04] speak the word and display the word
[3:07] instead of allowing the world and the
[3:09] corruption of the world to constantly
[3:11] take over in my home
[3:13] help us god
[3:15] tell your friends
[3:17] god has given us so much
[3:21] but to whom much is given
[3:23] much is required
