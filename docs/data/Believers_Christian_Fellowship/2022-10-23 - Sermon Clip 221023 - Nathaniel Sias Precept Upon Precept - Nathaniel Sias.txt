========================================

there was a message that was given to Noah there was instruction that was given to Noah he followed the instruction but within the instruction was a representation of a precept there was something that was being represented by what Noah was doing that was bigger even that what Noah was doing God committed a precept that when judgment is about to come that he will give away of escape and here it is being played out in this dramatic scene Noah is building an ark in the instruction was a precept and there are times where we look at instruction that has been given and we confuse the instruction with the precept we hear the instruction we we want to be obedient but in the instruction we miss the precinct so we are following this instruction and this instruction and this instruction and this instruction and Our Lives begin to produce strife but God never produces strife not with his children not not amongst his children and not within his children God is the author of Peace God is presenting peace he's giving us a message of peace and when he gives us a message a message of Peace it produces peace but I'm following the instruction I'm trying to do what God told me to do but friends there are times when we are looking at the instruction and we miss the precept this is why Jesus said I come not to destroy the law but to fulfill the law the precepts are written in the law of Moses but if you try to only follow the law it produces death friends it's so close it seems that I have a genuine desire I desire to do what is right and I'm following the instructions of God but we miss the precepts we miss God's intention and in doing so we misapply we misunderstand the precepts it is not just line upon line it is precept upon Precinct
