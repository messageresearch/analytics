[0:00] there's so many things when we get down
[0:02] to the heart of it there's so many
[0:04] things that we as human beings do to
[0:06] make us look good
[0:09] Cain his offering made Cain look good
[0:15] Abel was going to give a different kind
[0:17] of offering
[0:19] he was going to give an offering that
[0:21] pleased God
[0:24] and the only way to give an offering
[0:26] that would please God is he would have
[0:28] to die to everything he thought about
[0:31] what God wanted
[0:33] and wait for God to tell him what he
[0:35] wanted reveal it by Revelation and then
[0:39] just give God what God wanted
[0:42] with nothing extra
[0:44] when nothing lasts with nothing more but
[0:46] just to give God what he wanted but
[0:49] listen we're back in the same place
[0:51] today oh my goodness there's religious
[0:53] Spirits floating around all over the
[0:55] place amen and they're all around you
[0:57] and I amen so don't think they're
[0:58] somewhere else amen we can keep giving
[1:01] what makes us look good and look like
[1:02] Believers and say the right thing and
[1:04] look good or we can say I want to bring
[1:07] an offering by a genuine Revelation
[1:09] because I know who this is in this hour
[1:13] because he's revealed to me what he
[1:15] wants and what he wants is my life not
[1:18] my not just my money not just some time
[1:20] on Sunday and Wednesday he wants me
[1:23] because that's the plan and this day is
[1:26] to live in people
[1:29] so what does he want not a few hours a
[1:32] couple times a week a few dollars that
[1:35] come out of a paycheck that's not what
[1:37] he wants what does he want it's a
[1:39] revelation of what's going on in this
[1:41] day is going to require amen what we
[1:44] give indicates what we believe out of
[1:46] this message
[1:47] if I believe that this message is what
[1:50] God did through William Branham then I'm
[1:52] going to keep talking about what God did
[1:54] and how wonderful it was and all the
[1:55] wonderful things and I believe in the
[1:57] prophet and I'll keep living for self
[1:59] thinking everything's fine but what God
[2:01] wants in this day he got what he wanted
[2:03] in that day but what he wants in this
[2:05] day is a bride that he can pour himself
[2:07] completely into and she will be so much
[2:10] like him she will be him
[2:13] that's the that's the revelation of this
[2:15] hour Christ in you the hope of glory and
[2:18] you don't get there with a partial with
[2:20] a halfway withholding back for self
[2:24] so when it comes down to it amen
[2:28] when it comes down to it
[2:30] we've got to look at our lives and say
[2:31] what do I believe about this message
[2:36] and does my gift
[2:40] match my revelation
