here's my come f it and made me let's pray this evening precious Lord Jesus we truly do want you to come and fill our cups Lord father but we know your Prophet said that you wanted to fill us more than we even wanted to be filled Lord so we have to come to a recognition father that in order for you to fill our cups we need to First empty ourselves out Lord and that's our purpose for being here tonight father is to lay ourself here on your altar and just empty ourselves out Lord of anything that would not be like you father that you would come Lord and just scour us out Lord with your word father that you can come and pour in the balm of Gad Father Like Only You Can Do Lord father we stand here a needy people Lord and that's bad enough within itself but we've come to the closing moments of time and we've come as a people that are called to Perfection Lord and we've come to a point Lord that as needy as we are we don't even know what we have need of so we would just ask Lord that that you would come and that you would empty us out completely father and that you would fill us with that which is needful that we can walk and do and be what you would have us be we just want to commit this service to you father Bo both hearer and speaker Lord we've done all that we can morly do at this point and we would just ask now that you would come and do the supernatural that you would accomplish your purpose for this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you this evening it's certainly a pleasure and a honor to be with you we just invite you into the scriptures this evening to Philippians chapter 2 I just want to say I have certainly appreciated the messages that have went forth the last couple Services I started to say that I enjoyed them but it was maybe a little too close to home for enjoyment but I appreciated them amen and I will enjoy them I will make this flesh enjoy them it does not have a choice but I told him several years ago when he preached on Jacob and Esau for the first time that I was here that I was pretty well convinced it was the will of the Lord for him to preach on Jacob and Esau every service from thereafter so I think he's finally starting to yield himself to that Vision that I had I like preaching that's real saints and I like preaching that changes lives not just my life but my family's life my brothers and sisters lives and it's certainly being doing that whether it's pleasurable or not that doesn't make any difference but we want a real gospel we want to we want to serve a real and true God that can change our lives and can reveal to us where we're really at here in Philippians chapter 2 verse one it says if there therefore if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves and we just want to lay emphasis on that verse tonight let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but may himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men God bless you as you would have your seats this evening you all don't pay any attention to my emotions I've been that way for a couple weeks now after I read a quote that I'll get to here in a little bit but we're not here to play on your emotions we're we're we don't believe in doing that um but if if I'm an emotional wreck you just ignore that but I want to look here at verse three it says let nothing nothing is a big word covers a lot of things but the scripture says let nothing not even one thing be done through Strife or vain Glory that means by default that everything that we do should not involve Strife or any form of vain Glory but let each esteem other better than thems now skipping over to verse five it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so now the scripture is going to put us and reveal to us what was in the mind of Jesus Christ who being in the form of God remember we preached on that last couple times knew he knew where he came from and he knew where he was going he knew and had a proper understanding who he was so when this says who being in the form of God we know that this was not a flippant thought this was very firm he knew who he was yes am who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with god well why would it be robbery to be equal with God if you're God and this was not a confusing thought to him he knew who he was amen but with that Revelation but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant but made himself of no reputation none this would be equivalent to what we just read in verse three let nothing be done he made himself of no reputation we need to grasp this as we would start this thought here this evening he made himself of no reputation we have to understand that this was a man the only man that walked the face of the Earth who had a right to have any type of reputation in fact it was the only man that did have any form of what we would say good reputation we certainly came with a reputation and we probably don't want to discuss that this evening but here was the one and only man to set foot on this planet who would right Yul even have a possibility to have any reputation let alone the reputation that he did have as literally God himself on Earth the Son of God so he came as not only the only one having the right to have any type of reputation but he came as one with the greatest reputation right amen so we we have to grasp this we have to understand this it would be something if there was you know maybe a scale that we had to work with to balance this out but we don't because we don't have another example of this we don't have example a oh that man he had a right to be you know a one on a scale of 1 to 10 when it comes to reputation we don't have that the scripture says that we have all sinned and fell short of the glory of God so here's a man finally arrives on the scene and I think we would be kidding ourselves if we didn't think that up to this point that there were men already on the scene who tried to make themselves a reputation who tried to present them as being a good good man or better man or the best man I'm sure there was the whole gamut that was on display when it came to reputations prior to Jesus Christ showing up but now one finely does arrive who has a right to declare himself if he so chooses that I have a good reputation not only do I have a good reputation I have the best reputation and not only do I have the best reputation but you don't even have a good reputation in fact you don't even have a good reputation because all you have is a bad reputation yeah that's right you see the scale that we have to work with here it's unprecedented yeah but there here is a man standing where no man has stood and he would not even allow himself to have a one on a scale of 1 to 10 the scripture says he made himself nobody else you say well the Romans did that they trashed his reputation they told no no no no no Saints the Roman government had no control over this man 's reputation amen he voiced this when he came before Pilate you have no power over me unless it was given to you by God unless it unless I gave it to you you have no power you say the culture did it the murmuring the rumors no the scripture says he made himself of no reputation the only man who could have had a little bit of a reputation made himself of no reputation none nothing we have to grasp that not even he's a pretty good Carpenter right he's pretty well behaved as a child he made himself of no reputation everything that was said about this man was bad illegitimate mom had an affair with a soldier you name it everything that was said even before he showed up even before he showed up his reputation was already gone and I don't find one place in this book where he tried to change it the only man who had an argument contrary came that way even before he got here allowed it to be trashed a while he was here allowed it to be trashed and after he left allowed it to still be trashed and he's never tried to change it since amen and if that wasn't humble enough the scripture says that he took upon him the form of a servant so now not only has he allowed his reputation to be trashed but he would go and he would pick up the lowest reputation that he could find of those that were out there not his reputation but he would go and pick up that of a servant took the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so once again the man the only man to come to this planet that had a chance to make himself of a little bit of something said I will not do that and he humbled himself not only to have no reputation but to have the to become in the form of a servant and then to allow himself to Die the crest death on a cross for for what what did he do that for Saints who did he do that for for a 5' 10 150 lb Benjamin seab ball who would show up one day and he would think that he was a little bit of something something that he would think that he was a pretty good Christian that he would think he's got his act pretty well together that's what this man did that for he did all of that for somebody that would show up and be on the exact opposite end of the scale yeah who had no rights to declare himself as any type of reputation other than a bad one born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking life hybrid in a hybrid form violating the very essence of God in his first commandment let every seed bring forth of his kind we would show up in that condition in that situation with this as an example but yet we would somehow manage to by his grace get ourselves out of bed and take the Breath of Life in that he would would give us and somehow proceed throughout the day thinking that we're something I don't want to say we I'll say I I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching I'm preaching here how does that happen Saints how do we go from this level of humility God himself in flesh to crawling out of bed by the strength that he gave us by the life that he put in us how do we go from this example to all of a sudden thinking we're a pretty good message believer I'm a pretty good Deacon I'm a pretty good preacher how do we get there how does that happen when this example is there again I'm not preaching to you maybe I need to turn around and preach this way where's my cardboard cutout that I always say that I'm going to bring of my picture but how do we get there yeah how does how do we allow that to happen it's kind of mindboggling how we go from one end of the spectrum of right to totally off the end of the spectrum this way man who had the right to make himself something to a person who has no rights to nothing no thoughts of anything wouldn't even be able to get out of bed if it wasn't for his grace wouldn't be able to breathe if it wasn't for his grace wouldn't be able to even know there was a God if it wasn't for his grace let alone know that this God cared so much for me that he sent a voice in my age and this is that voice if that doesn't humble us Saints when there's billions of people on the face of the Earth and now there's this tiny minor percentage who knows there is a true God yeah who isn't out of their out of their mind so to speak naturally thinking that there's Little Green Men chasing them all over the place every day but we're in our in our natural sound mind but yet we would we would have him revealed to us not only that he is God and that he has sent a voice and he would by his grace let us know where that voice can be found but then to continue our Revelation in that to let us know that's not only just a voice that I sent to you but that's actually me showing up in your age and by the way this is my second coming this is how I chose to come the second time and and I've come to call you to come to come home with me and now I'm going to give you a message to to give you the power to overcome this Lan CH this a lan age and to to come up higher out of that and to be with me in a spiritual condition and going to culminate that by actually removing you from this Dimension and changing the atoms in your flesh yes because in case you forgot which I know that you have by this point your flesh is no good see the reason that I had to do all of that to reveal you to you that I was God and that I sent you a voice and that I came in that voice and through that voice I'm drawing you back to myself the the reason that I have to do all that is I have to come to remind you that you're nothing but somehow through this process of him coming and pouring all the grace that he can muster upon me somehow during that process in the greatness of the Revelation in the greatness of the understanding of where we're at and what's going on and what's happening and the changing that it's doing in my life and the changing that it's doing in my mind somehow in in all of that we lose the whole principle of the fact that he had to do all of this because I'm nothing and I don't have my act together and I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity and I have no reputation other than a bad reputation which is deserved me am the reason we find ourselves in this position is because this was injected into the human race at the fall it's called the pride of life and that's my topic for this evening the pride of life I have come to a revelation the last couple months that the pride of life is probably the most evilest wickedest abomination that has ever touched the human race you say well what about adultery and Heathen worshiping and that stuff PS in comparison to the pride that I find Within Myself even after conversion the pride of life goes so much deeper and so much higher and so much wider than I ever ever contemplated before and it is absolutely repulsive the effects that it has on our everyday living it is repulsive the effects that it has on our thought processen Ezekiel 2 verse two says son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus saith the Lord God but because thine heart is lifted up and thou Hast said I am God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God here's a scripture addressing an individual and we know this individual represented Lucifer and this scripture is addressing Lucifer ER saying because thine heart is lifted up so it it Reveals His condition because thine heart is lifted up because thy heart is prideful because of the pride of life in you you say I am God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God so because of the pride of life this man expresses himself I am God you say well I would never go that far brother have you ever taken your way over the word of God you may have never verbalized it but the minute that we get up here this is what the word of God says but you might as well just put your name right there in Ezekiel 2 I might as well put my name right there in Ezekiel 2 it's off of the same tree Saints the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that's where this man came from this where this is where this condition came from and the minute that we exalt ourself and our thinking over the word of God we've put oursel right there where that man was but remember that's what that man said that's not what God said that's what that man was saying God's response was thou art a man and not God so he brings a proper identification back to the situation you're a man you are not god let's establish that first and foremost so that we have something to work with remember I'm the one with the reputation you're the one without the reputation although he would never say that because he would never make himself of any reputation but he's sure going to bring a proper identification you are a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God skipping all the way down to verse 17 still speaking of Lucifer here thine heart was lifted up thine heart was lifted up where's 's the problem at it's in the heart your heart was lifted up I would be very confident in saying there's nobody that even before you walk out of here tonight as you walked in here this evening I would venture to say that none of you was out and about today telling vocalizing verbalizing to people of how great you were I'm confident that I associate with that kind of people people although your laughter is making me very nervous about that Revelation it's not what we verbalize it's what's in the heart thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty what beauty do we have we have the beauty of this message but will we allow our heart to be lifted up because of the beauty that this message is revealed build us in do we allow that to happen do we allow the beauty that he has closed clothed us with the beauty of the Bride do we allow the beauty of being his bride to lift up our heart I'm a pretty good Christian I'm a pretty good message believer I certainly don't believe like that guy does I mean you all heard what that church over there was doing didn't you thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom there wasn't anything wrong with the wisdom there wasn't anything wrong with the Revelation there wasn't anything wrong with the message there wasn't anything wrong with us being his bride but we in our heart somehow corrupted that amen and now allow it to have an effect that it shouldn't have even if we would never verbalize it or vocalize it within our heart we would be lifted up to where we would think somehow some way we have some type of reputation you say well I don't think that why do we spend so much time defending our reputation if we don't think we have a reputation one person say one thing that's not even half bad about and we lose our minds and we will spend three days sorting it out to make that right and make that brother correct himself true why the pride of life the evil dark dirty sinful yeah devil yeah of the pride of life amen we will spend three days because our feelings got to a little bit hurt and because if that brother tells this brother over here and it gets back to that sister they may think of my reputation somehow we've allowed the wisdom and the beauty to not have its full effect on our life and remove that aspect out of our life because our heart gets lifted up you see we can get our feelings hurt in that area because we have pride associated with how good of a Christian we are if you come to me and you tell me Benjamin seol you are the absolute worst mechanic I have ever met in my entire life you are awful you could not put a nut on a bolt if you had to you can't even rotate the tires on my car correctly you can't change the oil you are hands down the worst mechanic ever on the face of the Earth I'm here to tell you it is not going to bother me one bit if I hear that my brother second cousin by marriage to the third degree divided by the square OT of 64 was a little confused about something I said when I preached the other day I lose my mind why why the pride of life the devil of the pride of of life I'm not a good mechanic I'm not even a mechanic I'm not even able to stand by a mechanic it's not going to bother me a bit right I don't care it's true I'm the worst mechanic ever that's walked the face of the Earth if you don't believe me lean me your car for a week just an hour you got a Ratt on your dash I assure you when you get your car back the last thing on your mind will be a rattle in your dash I don't care but I am a minister am and that not of myself that's just the grace of God but somehow the beauty of the wisdom and the beauty of the message somehow in all of that I would have pride in my heart that you are a minister of the message message and this person over here I won't go through the whole equation again but you all got the point that you'll never even meet in your entire life was a little bit confused about something you said and might they might think that you were slightly off and I'll lose sleep over that why the pride of life the pride of life because it's something I care about and look I'm not trying to be fanatical about that you can't be a minister and not care about anything that you say or that people think like there has to be some concern there you have to have a heart for the people we're not here to you know say whatever we want to say and I don't care how you feel about it don't like that's you understand that's not the point it's not that we want to be Reckless with that Revelation the point is the pride that's attached to that to the IND indidual that's the evil part we have to submit ourselves one to another and that goes for ministers as well as the Le so it's not that we can ever take an attitude well nothing bothers me I heard this I don't care you know I'll preach what everyone preach and I don't care what it's not that at all it's just why does that bother your pride if somebody would think that you're wrong on something yeah now you can put that in whatever position you need to put it in if you're not a minister and you're a deacon make your put it in that position you're not a deacon you're you sing a special and you heard that somebody from another church listened to it and thought you were slightly off key why are you losing sleep over that the only reason that bothers you is if you think you're a pretty good singer yeah right I picked on myself for there a little while I get a pick on somebody else now because Lord knows I'm not a singer you can't put me in that group why would that bother you unless you had a thought amen that they shouldn't say that about me because because why yeah why shouldn't they say that about you amen yes because maybe it's not fair oh let's talk about fair fair born let me remind you of fair born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies cost the only innocent man that ever walked the face of his this Earth his life because of your fairness yeah let's not talk about Fair we don't want Fair Saints we don't want fair fair puts us in the deepest darkest hottest hell that there is period am that's fair yeah I don't want fair I want Mercy but we see how that we can so easily be offended and be be prideful about things that we would not consider evil look it's not like we have somebody attacking a reputation well I drank five beers and you only drank four and now you're offended because you're not the best Drinker I I think we're a little ways beyond that Saints but I'm here to tell you it's still the pride of life and it's off the exact same tree amen true the demon that'll cause that man to drink himself into a stuper just to prove he's more of a man than the hill belly sitting next to him on the bar who dranks six and I can drink Seven well I drink Seven now I'll drink eight it's the same thing that will cause you to lose sleep because somebody said something that offended you or might even possibly offend you or might possibly offend one of your neighbor kids about how of a Believer you are that fell off of the same tree and it's the same spirit it's the exact same Spirit and the spirit's name is the pride of life and it's the ugliest one that fell off of the tree Proverbs 6 16 these six things doth the Lord doeth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him guess what number one is a proud look I want to remind you this is the list of things that not God don't really like or kind of annoys him am finds it frustrating wish it would go away no this is the list of the things God hates and seven are an Abomination unto him number one being a proud look you say well I don't get up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror and be like well kind of no no no that's not it you may never look in a mirror but you may carry your reputation around in this shiny little crystal glass jar oh that was a bad situation did you see how well I handled that oh look how I tied those two scriptures together right there it's closer than we think Saints it's closer than we think a proud look God hates it a proud look let me say it this way looking proud trying to look proud being proud of how you look your look is not natural it can be naturally vision of course but we're a spiritual people remember and I think this is applying not to one but both there's maybe sometimes we should be more proudful of how we look naturally brother R says the holy spirit will clean you up he typed that to Natural hygiene he says the holy spirit will clean you up talking about dirty fingernails and stuff everybody put their hands in their pockets for a minute he said the Holy Spirit would naturally clean you up that you wouldn't go around with just being dirty but we'll spend so much time on that and we won't go around talking about how good we look I mean at least I hope we don't you understand we will spend so much time on our outward appearance and we don't try to make it of any reputation but we will spend such little time on our spiritual reputation but we'll spend so much time defending it this is a paradox why because of the pride of life a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood I want you to notice the group of other characters that this is with I mean we so easily blow right over oh a proud look well I'm not that a ly tongue I tell the truth sh I wouldn't shed innocent blood look at the group that Pride keeps the company that Pride keeps a liar I mean if we CAU somebody lying in the church we're going to deal with that it's going to go under church discipline would it not somebody that murdered somebody innocent blood like we're going to deal with that a man that's sitting around devising Wicked imaginations that's not going to go very far feet that's always running to get into trouble the deacons are going to handle that a false witness somebody constantly lying about their neighbor their brother's or sister that's not going to be acceptable and he that's constantly trying to break up Brotherhood sewing Discord among brother why is it that we will deal with six of those seven and not touch the seventh one why why will I not deal with the first one I will give my life fighting against those other six but I won't even address the first one and it is probably the ring leader of the whole group right you take pride out of that out of that group not going to be any honor among Thieves it they're just going to fall why would a man lie if it doesn't have to do with pride why y right did you steal the cookie no I didn't steal the cookie why are you lying about stealing the cookie because you're afraid you might get in trouble you'll be labeled as a thief Pride I mean it's I know that's a ridiculous example but I'm serious pride is associated with all of these it's because of Pride you tell a lie it's because of Pride that you would kill an innocent man pride is associated with all all of those false witness why would you want to break up Brotherhood if it wasn't for Pride well I'm a little better preacher than he is I got a little bit better light on the subject I'm he's not quite as spir you know I won't say it because I don't want to talk bad about my brother but you understand let's bring it home Hey listen my feet are on fire too it's not just yours don't worry like I'm looking for a trash can I'm looking for a fire extinguisher it's not just you when it comes home it comes home and I haven't even got to the good stuff yet and we're already on fire why would you want to break up Brotherhood find me one reason that you would want to break up Brotherhood I'm not saying that every time something is broken up that it's evil I mean God himself came down separated Abraham and lot um there there's there's times that God does that but that's not what this is referring to it says it says it's referring to and he that Seth Discord among Brethren to break up the Brotherhood Abraham didn't have to seow Discord to break up the Brotherhood Abraham says you know what you take First Choice whatever you want I'll go the other way that's not so IND Discord among Brethren so in Discord is I heard that he said that right and he preached that the other day and that did you hear how he handled that situation the other day oh yeah yeah I heard I wouldn't have done that I wouldn't have done that did you hear what the deacons did the other day why why so Discord among Brethren the only reason that you're sewing Discord and that you have to point out what this guy did right is so that you can now tell that person how you would have handled it right right because of course you handle everything right right we laugh at this but it's astonishing whenever this is truly revealed to us and I'm not saying that I have a perfect perfect proper revelation of it but I'm just here to tell you when when the lid came off of this to me a couple months ago I have been repenting ever since for two solid months I've had to repent and just when I think I get done I remembered something that happened in the third grade and I'm like what was I thinking and Junior High what was I thinking when I was homeschooled what was I thinking at this day at work what was I thinking the pride of life is what I was thinking the pride of life and I'm not talking sinful things Saints by his grace I was born and raised in the message and by his grace i' I'm I'm not you know seen if you want to say most of the world and I'm thankful for that i' I've got no complaints I'm just saying that don't put it out there in the world here's a real Zinger as brother Brandon would say have you ever sat in a church service and God will supernaturally anoint The Man Behind the pull pit to come and preach something that you and a brother were just talking about and you you know it's super natural but yet somehow in the beauty of the Revelation that's going on somehow I will sit in my seat and I will think Peter just listen to me tried to tell him boy I sure hope he's hearing that you say that does doesn't happen oh let's not kid ourselves Saints let's not kid ourselves let's be real let's be genuine remember if we want him to fill our cup up we better empty it out first there is a genuiness to this gospel there is a reality to this gospel and we're not going to get it by faking it and not dealing with the things that are needing dealt with we're not not going to to get it just by blowing these things away and acting like they don't happen and acting like that we're okay and acting like we're good Christians and acting like we've got our act together and that we don't have these things to deal with that's right we better deal with them now of our own free choosing because there's scriptures here that promises us that if we don't he will and I believe with all of my heart the things that God is going to do with this bride before we leave this earth and the power that he is going to entrust into our hands and even onto the foolishness of our tongue and our lips it is not going to come into a vessel that hasn't dealt with these issues who has not dealt with the problem and the demon and the devil that will somehow still come into my brain when I'm sitting under supernaturally anointed preaching and a situation will be exposed and I somehow still allow myself to let the pride of life raise up and think something contrary against my brother you think for a second that God is going to put the power of the spoken word onto that tongue that still has those thoughts and who still will not deal with those thoughts and say that is a devil and I do not accept that and I will not think those thoughts right he is not going to do it Saints we've got to be be real with ourselves and we have got to come to an understanding of where we're at and What needs dealt with and I've got good news for you and I've got bad news for you the good news is I cannot preach this to you in a legalistic way for you to get it that's the good news the bad news is I cannot preach this to you in a legalistic way for you to get it this is so far past legalism amen from the pull pit that it's not even funny right true but it's not past legalism from your seat prise God I cannot preach you to this level nobody else can preach you to this level you have got to make a conscience decision in your own seat that there is a possibility that I'm not where I need to be and this man's inviting me to come up [Music] higher and as he stands there and makes a fool out of himself and exposes himself for the ridiculous thoughts that he would have in a church service where the Supernatural is going on I don't want to just judge that man but I want to take advantage of the fact that he's revealing that there are spirits still working within me that are not acceptable from the message of the hour and the word of God and I want to identify these Realms in my life and I want to deal with them and I do not want to walk out of these doors thinking that I'm okay when I still have the pride of life rise in up in my thought process brother Brandon says it's come to the point to where if I could just get the people and I could just not this is not verbatim but just jam it into them if I could take it and I could just put it into them to where I know that they got it I would do it but he couldn't he says I can't but that invitation is there that invitation is there and by God's grace and by Revelation when he exposes these things to us and through the foolishness of preaching and a man to come here and to say thing I'm not proud to stand and say that I've had these things we chuckle about it and we you know kind of laugh about it you know to keep the nervous tension away but it's repulsive Saints what part of me thinks that it's acceptable to have that thought process right to think as God is supernaturally speaking a word across the body of people that I can boy I hope they're getting that maybe I should get it amen maybe I should get the beam out of my eye yeah amen but we so easily do that and we so easily accept that right and if somebody would tell a lie we would be calling Church order and we would be dealing with it and if somebody would shed innocent blood we would be dealing with it immediately if somebody would be spreading rumors trying to break up Brotherhood we would deal with it that day we wouldn't let it go till the next day we would deal with it then but we won't deal with that Pride that's rising up during the service in our own mind we don't have to get a counsil together to deal with it we don't have to go to the pastor we don't have to get approval from the deacons we have the a the possibility and the permission to deal with it right then amen but we won't we'll just let it go let it sit there let it fester and think somehow that we're right in doing that we'll deal with all the other things but we won't deal with the main thing the ring leader of it the pride that's in ourselves amen I say God have mercy on us I say God have mercy on me Proverbs 8 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate the fear of the Lord is to hate let's call it for what it is the fear of the Lord is to hate evil amen now it gives us what evil is pride and arrogance Y and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate Proverbs 13 only by Pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom it is only with pride that you can have an argument with your brother why can you have an argument with your brother Pride because if you don't think you're right there is no argument if you approach it with I might be wrong because let's remember flashback born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the word speaking lies let's approach this conversation that way but we don't we approach it with I've been in the message for 40 years I've read the Seal's book three times Church age book six at the top of page 328 paragraph two I can tell you what the two purposes of the second forerunners to do oh what' you say brother I might be wrong let's make it real saints let's not act like it don't happen right why don't we approach the conversation so that there's not the possibility of contention and approach it with humility as in this drug head that was just saved 30 seconds ago might be able to tell me something I've never experienced before not with how in the world would he ever tell me nothing I don't know I'll give you a little clue for those of you whove by his grace been born and raised in the message those kind of people are going to open your eyes more than the people that's sitting in the church beside of you it's cuz they don't have the message filter they just speak what they know's truth that's they just call the principal for the principle and it's shocking and it will open your eyes and you could have sat in the message for 30 years rubbing shoulders with everybody in the ranks of the message the problem with everybody in the ranks and in the circles they've all got the same Viewpoint I'm not saying on everything understand what I'm saying it's just I mean let's face it if you've been in this message for more than 10 years you you've probably heard just about everything around it right I mean I'm not trying to be funny that's just natural like if you go to the same place of work every day for 10 years the water cooler rumors or whatever like you've probably heard all of them by this point it'll be somebody that comes in that's new that will be like hey did you hear you like what I never heard that it's the same thing spiritually speaking when you have the same viewpoints constantly around you and around the same people it's going to take somebody new also known as the drug head that was just saved 30 seconds ago to rock your world and to show you that maybe you haven't heard everything right I remember the first time this ever happened to me I was sitting in Beckley West Virginia and Perry green was given his testimony I was probably I don't know maybe 18 years old born and raised in the message Dad's a pastor I mean I've been there done that I've heard it all Perry green comes and he puts on his slideshow the picture of the prophet's profile in the cliff and I had never seen that picture before you you know what I'm talking about out in Arizona I had never seen that picture before since it blew my mind the profile of the prophet's face I mean it's I mean you can't miss it and I never seen that picture before and I'm sitting there in my seat and I see this picture for the first time and as an 18-year-old I had a great Revelation there's this small chance small I mean it's pretty much remember I'm 18 I'm an 18-year-old male it's pretty small but there is a chance I don't know everything and I haven't seen everything one picture was lifechanging for me God because it totally wrecked my world of thinking I'd seen everything and I'd read everything and I I don't say that lightly by his grace I was I was raised right and I had the proper things put before me as a child and I love the message I read the message I read the church I looked at the photos I listened to the testimonies I loved it but somehow somehow in the beauty of all of that wisdom I came to the conclusion that I've seen it all and then I know it all and now I'm 39 and it's happening all over again read one quote totally wrecks my my world am and I come back to the conclusion that maybe I got something to deal with yet maybe there's part of me that's not okay quite yet maybe I still got some problems I know you all are dying to hear that quote but I'm going to just keep on going here only by Pride cometh contention amen have you ever heard of discernment by the word we've heard that that saying discernment by the word when you see two brothers arguing about a spiritual principle and they're upset with each other here's the discernment by the word one of them most likely both of them are dealing with pride yes sir that's easy to say Amen to right let's go a little step further next time because there will be a next time that you find yourself getting a little hot under the collar right with your brother about a topic that he for whatever reason just somehow cannot grasp maybe we should use discernment by the word and realize there maybe might be some pride involved that's amen maybe not on his part only this would be proper discernment by the word sir you say well that's real simple that's real easy you know can you move on to the seventh seals and the coming of the Lord this is the coming of the Lord Saints brother Brandon would preach the seals you go back and read the seals almost every time that he would break a seal in his prayer he would said Lord please come and break this seal so that we know how to live well I want to know who the first horse rider is no you need to know how to live that's right who are them Souls under the prison you need to deal with your pride you need to know how to live you need to learn how to treat your brother you need to have you need to learn that you're probably not right all the time brother brandom says I thank God for the day that the seals broke in my life it was a wonderful thing Saints to have the seals come off of this book you would be ignorant to say otherwise I hope that's not a prideful statement I didn't have anything to do with it so I don't think it is you would be ignorant to think that the seals the interpretation of those symbols coming off of that book was not a marvelous event but how much more so when it has the effect of loosing the seals of our own life how much more so what good is it if he breaks the seals off of the written word but yet I'm still all closed up and can't see myself for who I am good and bad right so much more marvelous only by Pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom Proverbs 16 Pride goeth Before Destruction the these are verses we learned in Sunday School saints why didn't we get it then Pride goeth Before Destruction you want to have a Sure Fire way to have your Meer reputation destroyed start thinking you have a reputation yeah it's scriptural you'll never beat it the moment that you think that the scripture kicks in oh Pride goeth Before Destruction there is probably hundreds of angels lined up on this Duty it's probably a task force like okay I am God I have to keep my word pride cometh Before Destruction oh there's one there's one there's one like they have to have a ladder going up and down constantly Pride goeth Before Destruction it's in the word of God it will never fail if you don't want destruction in your life we spend every minute of every day trying to prevent destruction in our life but we'll never deal with the one Surefire way that it's coming if you you want to know the safest thing you can do for yourself to avoid heartaches bad times trials tribulation destruction the first and most simplest thing you can do for yourself is kill your own Pride I don't know what percentage it takes off but I guarant you at least has to be double digits has to be because now this scripture is set to the side there's no Pride there's no need for Destruction if there's Pride there's a need for Destruction amen you say that is so simple I know I know I say God help me why can't I get it why can't I get that like every time I turn around and run into a wall God what's happening what's going oh yeah I did think that I did I had it coming I thought it and I didn't rebuke it and I let it sit there amen let alone the things we flesh out let alone the things we actually manifest that's right and then we're dealing with years of reaping the the destruction from that Pride that's right amen every minute that you continue that argument yeah oh yeah you're going to reap it because you know better I know better why not five minutes into the argument be like this ain't going so good you know what why don't I just try to be humble and see where they're coming from you just saved yourself like 13 months of trials and tribulation and you don't even know it I don't know the equations how they work out Saints but it's true that's how it works it and you know what's the Paradox about all this is once we finally get to that point and we start bypassing all of that destruction that we Heap upon oursel now I don't know why but God comes along and he says Satan have you considered them people and now we got destruction coming and we never even ask for it but God wants to show us off amen and prove to Satan that we're not like the first Eve and that the caliber of the man of job is still here on Earth right amen amen I think that it's a very valuable and honest way and prudent way when we find ourself upside down and just ran into a wall and destruction all around I find it very prudent to First approach God and say Lord is there anything that I have done I go so far to say Lord is there anything that I have done said or thought I would love to stand here and tell you that I do all of that before I ask him why I'm working on that I'm not there yet but I'm working on it and by his grace I'll get there before I even come and ask him why why me woe is me what I want to first come say Lord is there anything that I have done said or thought that has caused this around me see a lot of times we're wanting God to come and Deliver Us from something and we're the ones that put the destruction around us and we're the ones that can take the destru ruction away you say well how do you do that well you know how you do that hey ding D dinging ding hey you know what I said the other day I was wrong I'm sorry please forgive me Walls Start crumbling down years of bad seed that you just sewed gets washed away amen but why is it so hard to say Hey brother can I see you after church I I got to make something right with you whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you've you have been in the message for 12 years two days he should be coming to you and being like hey I was kind of out of line the other day why why are we still dealing with such Elementary things when we have been given the most powerful word on the planet am and we still have a problem saying Hey brother I was wrong the other day I have no clue what I was thinking you know why we can't do that is because we have to make this brother feel that we were thinking something right the other day like that we've got our act together that we're at least right 75% of the time what if he thinks I'm only right 60% of the time what if he thinks I'm only squared away 50% of the time right who cares what they think amen how about we start caring what the master thinks how about we start caring about what the one who's in control of the destruction thinks and that's just naturally like we know we don't serve God out of a out of fear you know of what may come upon us we serve him out of love am but there are natural things that we can address here and there are natural things that there are many things we can avoid just by applying this simple spiritual principle amen Pride goeth Before Destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall you want to guarantee yourself to fall get a hotty spirit it's scriptural it'll never fail that's right guarantee you guarantee you if you're a child of God and you take a hotti spirit you will fall amen it's a guarantee better is it to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud amen I think this applies more to things than just proud men sitting around together counting their money right better is it to be of a to be humble and of a l and with the lowly better is it to be humble and with the lowly than to sit around and divide the spoils with the proud I don't think that we're dealing with staying up and losing sleep at night because we have all of our friends over and we're you know checking everybody's bank account look here woo this is good look this is good do you see this investment I made no Saints we wouldn't do that at least I would hope not but we'll have a ministers meeting sorry I'm preaching about preachers because I'm a preacher it's the way it works just hope I don't get on whatever occupation that you are we'll set at a ministers meeting and there'll be two groups in the room this group over here nailing it down answer after answer question I got it boom answer answer answer this group over here has been like I don't know I think this but I'm not sure I've seen it both ways I'm not real sure I'm undecided which group do you want to be a part of like do you want to be the one who don't have a clue about anything and hasn't decided about anything or do you want to be the one with the answers you say well that's easy oh no Saints it's not because pride pride gets involved by the way after I preach I'm never com back to church this is humiliating it's horrible but it's the truth I'm telling you right now if I never preach again it's the truth who wants to be seen as the guy that don't have a clue when you've got the search table I mean you can set in the ministers meeting search the question and have three responses before it even gets your turn or you can be real with yourself and when it comes your turn you can be like well I've seen this I've seen this and I've seen this to be honest with you I still got to pray about it I don't know amen I don't know well that's the 14th time you've said I don't know do you know anything no I don't know anything I shouldn't even be here why did you all even let me in but why instead of that we walk into the ministers meeting like can't wait till I get asked a question I am going to blow their minds you say that doesn't happen in the message oh my my my my love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for th all that is in the world the lust of the flesh oh you carnal person you carnal person fleshly lust lust of the eye PR my my my always wanting something they can't have why don't we have the same repulsion to the pride of life am lust of the flesh we'll crucify that brother lust of the eye we'll chop his hand off pride of life hey you you behave yourself get on out of here if it wasn't for the third one the first two wouldn't even be problem amen why do we always want to deal with the first two but we won't deal with the third one yeah all that is in the world all is a big word but he puts it in three categories all that is in the world the lust of the flesh we got to deal with that the lust of the eyes we certainly have to deal with that the pride of Life we'll get to it whenever we have time can't be that way anymore Saints it's got to start inside quit trying to control your eyes and control the lust of your flesh when you cannot control your own Pride it'll never work you better first die to yourself you better first be real with yourself and say Lord I've got a problem and I think that I'm something and I've got to deal with that first because if you never deal with that first you are constantly going to be going the way of the eyes and the ways of the flesh because you don't realize that you are the problem you're going to be constantly blaming it on well I walked and I solved this and I walked and I got put in this situation and i' succumb to the weakness and the temp deal with the pride first deal with the fact that you are born in sin shaped in iniquity don't have your act together don't stand a chance without his anointing amen that's right don't know anything and then let that work outward and manifest itself in your flesh and in the in your eyes deal with the most repulsive first deal with the most powerful first look at the categories I'm sorry look at the company that the pride of life keeps we went through that in Proverbs there a minute ago I believe it was but look at the company that this guy keeps we already went through all the other ones but now he he keeps company with the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes he does not keep good company and it is of the world and the world passeth away way and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever I'm getting shorter on time so I'm going to go a little bit faster here Mark 7 and when he had called the people unto him he said unto him unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entereth into him that can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile a man verse 21 for from within out of the heart of the man proceede evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy I mean these are not good things Saints like this is the top the top 10 most wanted yeah guess who's next on the list pride and foolishness it's not what goes into a man that defiles him Jesus said it's what comes out of him and what comes out of him are evil thoughts adulteries fornication murders theft Covetous wickedness deceit lasv an evil eye blasphemy pride comes out of him foolishness that is that which destroys a man we'll spend every waking moment of every waking day dealing with all those other things and trying to re them in and keep them under control and we won't deal with pride but yet Pride's right in there with the rest of them all these evil things this is what the scripture calls them evil I want to clarify something a bad attitude is not I'm sorry pride is not just a bad attitude Pride it's not just a bad attitude it is a devil yes it is not just a bad attitude let's identify it for what it is I'm telling you what it's not it is not just a bad attitude like it is not just you having a bad day it is not you just getting stuck in a situation it is not you just having a disagree agreement with your brother that is not what pride is pride is a devil it will come in various shapes and situations let's not belittle it and call it something other than what it is let's not make excuses for it that was just me having a bad day I was under a lot of tension and it was the devil of Pride that I now have to deal with and I'm going to deal with him because he's a devil I'm not going to explain it away I'm not going to sweep it under the carpet I'm going to deal with this devil of Pride if we don't handle him appropriately he's going to rule and reign in our lives let's handle him appropriately this is what the scripture calls him evil things evil things questions and answers brother brandom says now let's take a look back at Cain could you tell me where that spirit and that meanness come from if Cain was the son of Adam which was a Son of God where did that evil come from the first thing when he was born he hated he was a murderer he was jealous and now take the nature of his daddy the very start in the beginning Lucifer and he was in the beginning he was jealous of Michael that's what started the whole trouble right the whole trouble that we see and the things that we haven't seen for centuries remember we're 6,000 years into this just in this time allotment we're 6,000 years into that and all of that is because one person was jealous of another that's right but yet we think somehow we're going to reverse everything with pride still laying in our heart that we're going to go back to an Eden condition with the very thing that ruined even before a needing condition we better call it for what it is and we better deal with it for what it is it is a devil it is the same fruit that fell off the the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that ruined in the beginning and even before the beginning it was the same fruit from the tree the evil tree the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Pride fell off of that tree that's right and it ruined God's Church in heaven he was jealous of Michael that's what started the whole trouble jealousy Pride brother Brandon says remember that he was that he wanted to build a little better Kingdom than that of the humble kingdom kingdom of Michael interpreted that is I have a little bit better idea than you and because me naturally my idea is right that Saints is literally what started the downfall of everything is one man thinking somehow some way that he was entitled and would have of course a better idea than this man and that started the downfall of everything that's how power ful that is that's how evil that is let's not brush it away like it's something lightly let's call it for what it is it is a devil of Pride 1953 go tell my disciples the quote that you've been waiting on this whole service that I've never got to speaking of Mary brother brandom says she knew there was something about him was different from anyone anyone else speaking of Jesus she had Seven Devils cast out of her everybody that's been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they're standing no one can ever come in his great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore so she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy he doesn't list the other five we read that scripture and we know this lady in the Bible who had Seven Devils out of cast out of her but now a prophet comes on the scene and starts identifying what two of those Devils were and the two that he identifies are pride and envy Devils that she had cast out of her I'm sorry but if like I've read this story and heard this scripture many times and we knew she was not a good woman she was a woman of ill Fame my mind did not go to Pride and envy my mind went to much more repulsive things you know adultery fornication the list goes on and on and on brother brandom comes and identifies this two of the Seven Devils that was cast out of her were pride and envy that in itself caught my attention and started my mind blowing the next statement that he makes is what put me in Repentance for the last two months here's his definition of pride and envy she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her the prophet identified that as a devil one of the Devils that the scripture would reference this is a famous woman in the scripture Saints she is known all around the world of having Seven Devils cast out of her but nobody's ever asked well what were the Seven Devils but a prophet comes on the scene and he would tell us one of those Devils was pride and the way that that Pride manifest the way that that devil right of Pride manifested itself catch this Saints the way that that devil of Pride manifested itself was in her mind she thought she was pretty and there was nobody like her as I said Saints this is not something I can preach you into you either get it or you don't get it you either realize yeah I've had some thoughts like that or you don't like I can't fix that I can't make it have the same effect on you that it had on me but I know one thing when I heard this and I realized that the prophet just identified one of the Devils that was cast out of this woman was pride and that Pride the devil of Pride manifested Itself by her thinking I'm kind of pretty and there's nobody like like me I realized I had a lot longer down the road to go than I realized I got a lot more Benjamin seol that needs to die than I realized and I've never even thought that I was pretty thought I was a pretty good Deer Hunter though I even thought I was a pretty good state trooper at one point and I got some ribbons to back up my argument you want know what that is that's a devil of Pride it's not Benjamin been a little cocky that is a devil of Pride that's not Benjamin been a little bit conceited that is a devil of pride I even thought I preached a couple good sermons every once in a while I seen it affect a couple people's lives one time I must be a pretty good preacher you know what that is Saints don't let it be something that it's not call it for what it is you say well there's nothing evil about that Saints we're so far beyond evil things it's it's done sa that's not the day we live in we have been called so much higher the devil of Pride manifested Itself by her thinking that there was nobody like her she was kind of pretty there was nobody like me me can we take that and put it in our own lives yes I think if we can honestly do that we'll realize real quickly we have not arrived yet and I think if we will ponder on these things and go back and search out Saints I've been opening doors in my life that have been shut for decades now that I realized that this is not just a complex this is not just seabolt DNA this is just not culture this is not just this is just the way that I am now that I've realized that's not what this is and this is a devil I've been hunting him down I have been hunting him down and I'm going to be honest with you along the way I've been absolutely repulsed at myself and I'm going to be repulsed at myself tomorrow when I find something else in the next day when I'll find something else from 12 years ago but I know one thing nothing's ever going to change if I don't go hunt him down and if I just let it be okay and I just let him lay there nothing's ever going to change but now that I know how this devil of Pride can manifest itself I'm on high alert for him and I'm hunting him down and I am changing my ways and I am changing the way that I think by his grace because I'm I recognize very very clearly that I cannot do this myself Saints I am so wrong I don't even know how wrong that I am am amen I have conducted and operated my myself for decades in a way that I thought it that I thought was okay and I've been wrong the whole time how do I stand a chance how do I stand a chance of figuring this out how how do I even know what to repent of and go make right I didn't even know it was wrong for decades how do I think that I'm going to figure out going forward it's only going to be by his grace to prick my conscience and be like hey remember what that is that's not just you disagreeing or having a better idea or you you better identify that for what it is you you better not talk to your wife that way that's not just you lining her out listen I believe in a man ruling his house you better not do it with pride you better rule your house you are held accountable for her and your children you better not rule it with pride and you better not set yourself up before your children like dad's got his act together Pride cometh before a fall you want to fall before your children set yourself up before him like dad's like dad knows what he's talking about you remember the story brother brandham said he said I'll be sitting there talking with the kids and I'll tell him hey there was three great men that came out of Kentucky and his wife said now Bill he said I would have to go off into the corner into the closet and repent of that Saints I don't think he was faking I don't think he was over there Lord I did it again sorry when he said I had to slip off and go get in the closet and repent for joking with his kids that there were three great men that came out of Kentucky we better reset the bar because it's closer than we think and it's lower than we think and we have trampled over it I have trampled over it egregiously thinking they understand me they know who I am then she thought she was so pretty and there was nobody like her but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clean all of that left her what left her pride and envy she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight amen it didn't say she wasn't pretty anymore saints of God this was an ill-fed woman this is how she made her living I'm sorry but I don't think she was ugly her visual appearance did not change what changed was she was not so pretty in her own eyes anymore when he said be thou clean pride and envy left her appearance didn't change but her heart did her thinking did the pride went out and now she didn't think I'm kind of pretty and there's nobody like me I say Lord come to me and tell me to be clean speak your words over me to be clean drive this out of my life that I don't have these thoughts anymore facts of of situations may not change the r ribbons that I earned they're not going to go anywhere there's facts to back those up but what needs to change is the mindset behind them that I thought I was a pretty good interdiction officer I've got facts to back it up Saints it's not about the facts it's about what's in the heart I thought I was a pretty good Deer Hunter I've got facts to back that up that's not what need to change I don't need to go burn all the deer heads what needs to to change is up here I've got some pretty good rabbit dogs I don't need to go shoot my rabbit dogs the dogs are not the problem right here is the problem killed my l in less than two hours the other day this is what needs to change not the dogs that's right you say that's Petty I say we better start being petty I say we better be so petty to where we wake up and look oursel in the mirror every morning and not one thought crosses our mind that I'm a pretty good Christian that's how Petty we better get that I've got my act together that I'm his bride I'm okay we better wake up every morning look in that mirror and in our mind see the most beautiful bride of Jesus Christ That Ever Walked the face of this Earth and still be able to look at it and be like you better get yourself together you better be more sincere that's right you better humble yourself right we're not going to walk out of this building and not be bride Saints we're bride and there's facts to support that and I would not want to change that but we better be the bride with the right attitude we better not be the bride that's the apple of his eye because we're kind of pretty and there's nobody else like us right right we better get beyond that I know where I'm at on time but if you'll bear with me just a little bit more I want to read this this little bit and and come to a close brother Ren says she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master let's get out of my mind that I'm kind of pretty and there's nobody like me and let me have him breathe his word over me to be clean amen and now let me take myself and wrap myself in meekness his meekness his humility and walk after him brother brandom says there's 2/3 of the earth that's in sin and more than that which two-thirds of the Angels were kicked out and those demon Spirits came into people and habitate their body see what I mean they're demons catch the the the words that he's using here they demons that once existed and they came into the people and gave them a nature Jesus cast seven out of uh seven of them seven of them what demons out of Mary Magdalene listen to the list Pride boast big people you see she thought she was something unclean now he starts getting into the ones that I would think of unclean filthy vulgarity listen to this one emulations emulations you know what emulation is it's competition thought I was a pretty good basketball player emulations demon demon you better get rid of it it's not acceptable anymore the word has exposed it it's not acceptable to me anymore competition is what that is emulation competition the church volleyball setting it was over the line it wasn't over the line competition we'll stand there and argue about it for five minutes I won't CU I don't play volleyball but you all will that like to play volleyball I know you all won't want to do it for 5 minutes I've seen you all you conduct yourself right but if you would in a moment of weakness that's emulations I've been to church camps and literally seen Brothers get mad at each other whether a ball was in or out and I'm like who cares come over here so I can tell you what a good Deer Hunter I am that's the truth that's the real demon the real demon is not the brothers over here arguing about whether the ball was in the real demon is the guy over here who wants him to shut up so he can tell them what a good Deer Hunter he is sure is nice to point at the other two brothers though and be like look how ridiculous they're acting don't they know that's emulations don't they know that's a demon you ought have seen this deer I shot the other day it was huge took me two years to kill him you want to know how I killed him outsmarted him you don't you don't want to hear you don't want to hear it what's the matter with you I hope I'm not that bad but I'm not going to lie anymore and say the thought's not there and even if I have the thought I still need to deal with the thought and I need to quit roing about these guys every here making fools out of themselves fighting over whether the ball was in or out and I need to deal with the demon yeah the devil amen that's causing pride in my own heart really the only reason that I'm upset about them making fools of themselves is because they never picked me to play anyhow cuz they know that I wouldn't stand that wouldn't be any good you put yourself in that put yourself in that setting you say well I'm not there fighting over the volleyball I'm not there wanting to tell the guy what a good Deer Hunter I am no you're the sister sitting over in the corner all upset because somebody complimented her cherry pie and didn't compliment your cherry pie hey we're all there you go find yourself cuz I'm not going to make a bunch of enemies finding finding you for you because I like your pies I have facts to support that too I won't give you my Witnesses though we're all there at that camp we're all there in that Circle we're all there under the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil with pride hanging all around us and it's so easy to find it here and here and here and you let one of them older men make an inappropriate comment to one of them younger sisters and you'll be going out of here maybe alive maybe not uncleanness at the church camp will not be tolerated we will deal with that before it happens but the demon of Pride and the devil of Pride will run all around the CR ground screaming and hollering and tooting his horn and we'll be like what's that what's wrong what's going on oh just leave him alone he it's a demon it's a devil and it's in the same category as that pervert that would want to do something of that to a young sister we may not understand that but there's too much scriptural proof and I've read them to you right it's in the same category it needs to be dealt with the same way brother Brandon said speaking of Joseph Joseph type Perfection brother brand says Joseph problem this is not verbatim you you go find the quote he said Joseph's problem was Joseph thought he was a pretty good boy you say well he was that wasn't the problem the problem was Joseph thought that he was a pretty good boy I'm not speaking of his son I'm speaking of the Bible character the one in Egypt right that was next to pharaoh who has facts to support that he was a pretty good boy like my brothers beat me half to death sold me into slavery I got thrown into prison for an false accusation and now I'm here seated beside the throne I must be a pretty good boy that wasn't the problem the the facts were not the problem the problem was he thought he was a pretty good boy yeah and he goes through all of that so that he can finally get to an understanding of what then he knows how to manage grain real well no he goes through all of that to get to a proper understanding I'm not okay and I have issues that I need to deal with I am not a pretty good boy he got to the point Saints the brother random says you've heard me quote this before that when trials and tribulation would come his way he would respond with Lord what part of your forn knowledge am I manifesting out now I was talking about this with our pastor the other day and he gave me some great insight and he actually gave me hope for myself but he said that's true and I believe that but if Joseph was a man like us he probably didn't do that the first time I just thought well if that's what brother brandham said well that's the way it's always been but let's think about it realistically like when he's getting beat and thrown in the pit and sold off into sve slavery like that might not have been at the point in time that he was saying Lord what part of your for knowledge am I manifesting right now it may have been a few years down the road to where he finally came to a realization so something greater is working here I need to grow up I need to deal with myself I'm not a pretty good boy anymore right these things are going on in my life but I see his hand over me all of the time I know where I would have fell but he kept me I know where I would have went astray but he kept me my life is a wreck right now I don't want to respond inappropriately Lord what part of your for knowledge in I manifesting out today that's where I want to get to Saints not why me Lord woe is me what are you doing this surely can't be fair I want those responses are from Pride those responses are from Benjamin thinking he's a pretty good boy that he's a pretty good Christian that he's a pretty good message believer that's how he responds I'm done with that by his grace I'm done with that now I want to respond I done said or thought anything that would Grieve Your Spirit out of my life that would allow this to come on me or is this simply you manifesting some part of your forn knowledge through me that's how I want to respond in humility I'm going to go through these last few examples very quickly and then we're going to close close it's almost 9:30 30 I thank God that we had a prophet that was real that we had a prophet that would stand and make even more of a fool out of himself than I've made out of myself tonight that would be so raw and expose himself before the public right he says and so they called me back out this was during the time of the flood and I always lived on the river and quite a Boatman you all have already caught up I don't even know to go you all know where he ended up at the Falls with a boat that won't start praying and screaming and hollering before God save me save me I'm quite a Boatman but say no he wasn't say nothing about being quite a Boatman then Saints you want to set yourself up to go over the falls of Life get in your head you don't even have to verbalize it just get in your head that you're quite a Boatman on this sea of life yeah let me know how that works out for you your engine's going to stop brother R said so I went out the next day and I took my little old rifle and walked down this way well I thought I was just too good of a Woodsman to ever get lost I'd been in the woods all my life he said now you couldn't turn me around I told you I could go really fast because you all got the principal we know the end of this story right Lord where's where's the wire at where's the wire at I'm lost I can't do nothing SS he was not joking that was life or death but he is he this is the seventh angel in the Book of Revelation amen who's now taking upon himself the nature of Christ to make of himself no reputation just to tell a story how it really happened why I'm really up here on this mountain with my hand up in the air hoping to hit a wire so my family don't die down at the bottom of the mountain why I'm really in this position cuz I took a demon of pride in my life and I thought I was a pretty good Woodsman and the facts said that he was and the facts did not change what changed before he came off of that mountain is he no longer longer thought that he was a pretty good Woodsman yeah said I thought I was just too good I couldn't get lost you see God had to learn me some sense so put some brains in my head to let me know that I wasn't self-sufficient that's right that's his interpretation of that event God I wasn't as good as I thought I was that's the seventh angel for you I say we should follow the example he said here you're too good of a wisman you you ain't lost what's the matter with you and I sat down on a rock I thought now you think you're lost don't you but you're not and I sat down on a rock again say now you're not lost you know where you're at why stand still you know where you're at but all the hunting and Wood's ability I had was gone I'm telling you I was actually completely lost says I was moving I thought oh God I'm lost I'm lost Lord I have no Compass I've nothing this is me the last two months once the seal came off of this Revelation this is me I'm lost I am lost I am nothing and I don't even have a compass to get myself out of this situation I don't even have the the well-being and the the ability to get myself out of this condition don't leave it on the mountain Saints bring it right here he says I have nothing but I said I still have you Lord and I kept talking out loud I thought wait a minute now you're going to get out of hand you're going to get frantic you're thinking about your wife dying tonight and that baby I said you better think about that you better think about dying and losing everything that you have don't leave it in this story Saints we better think about dying and losing everything that we have he's saying I'm making this prayer before God that I'm lost I'm lost I need help I don't even have and at the same time I'm having a thought you better get yourself together you're going to get franic you're going to get panicked you're going to lose your wife and your baby you better get yourself together is this not what we go through on a daily basis approach God and try to die to self see if this if this Same Spirit don't come come along right you better get yourself together you're overreacting you don't really need to do that you're okay true Spirits don't die Am Lord I'm not worthy to live but don't let them die okay now we're going somewhere who does this sound like this sounds like a man who made of himself no reputation Lord I'm not worthy to live but don't let them die here it is almost dark I'm lost father totally lost now we're getting somewhere totally Lo I'm not just lost I'm totally lost and I don't even know how to fix it God Amen won't you help me I say God wants you help me and I felt somebody on my shoulder I say praise God I felt them on my shoulder before Saints but I've got to fill them again amen I felt him on my shoulder before but I needed again I turned to look who it was and just then the fog cleared away and I followed through the bushes I seen I was going straight into Canada the way I was going with my knowledge and here was Hurricane Mountain right up here it was on the other side see I was passing right by it and everything that he could think to do in all his Woodmans ship in all his ability in all his thinking I'm a Prett good Woodsman and I can't get turned around and I can't get lost he finds himself even after prayer going the exact opposite way he should be going you say well then what chance is there there's still a hand Saints there's still a hand and there's still the master of the Wind brother random got to a point and he was preaching one time I think it was in the seals but I could be mistaken and he's going along boom boom boom tying stuff together and he says I was talking to this guy the other day and if ID have just had two two if I had two minutes I could have tied him up in knots into scriptures and hang on just a second hang on what's wrong oh he didn't like that I'm sorry you think that lesson on the mountain didn't come to fruition sir you think it didn't have some fruit you didn't think it changed his life that quick make a statement oh wait stop he didn't like something I find it astonishing the first thing that he comes to is oh maybe it was something I saidise not what's wrong with you all out there right is somebody resisting the message oh something I said right amen brother Randa said told a story one time I felt one time that God owed me an explanation remember how that worked out for him Saints I thank God for an honest Prophet I know we say that but it is astonishing what would we do if he would try to cover up 50% of the experiences that he had if he would not be honest and tell us what uh what came before these situations we would lose the lesson but because he was willing to make himself of no reputation I'm not saying he did it on day number one but by the end of the time when he left the face of this this Earth he would and I'll prove it to you here in a second he would make himself of no reputation so that we would get it am that is astonishing nobody's had a messenger like this before Luther couldn't do this Wesley couldn't do this this Pentecostalism can't do this Saints this is genuine sir said I felt God would me an explanation we know that didn't work out too good for him brother brand says that's the problem with mankind God will bless a man a little bit and then he gets all puffed up every time God will give him a little bit of gift he says and he gets all puffed up that's the problem with humans brother brandom says if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you prideful arrogant Pride if you want to get anywhere with God don't ever let that come around you brother Chad was preaching on John a couple Services ago and how that he represented the bride and how that there was so much more information and details in the Book of John and as he was preaching that I was already dealing with this thought but it struck me John outran Peter to the Grave John outran Peter to Jesus Christ where he was he outran him but John having the appropriate Spirit of the Bride on him yes never boasts about being quicker right it was factual he put it in there it was factual the other the he said the other disciple outr humility he never talks about how fast that he ran or how much faster than Peter he was and how he got the Revelation you see where I'm going he got it first why is it that we always have to be the first one to get the Revelation why can't we just say brother I have I've been in the message for 30 years and I have never seen that where did you get that from no it's oh yeah it's interesting yeah I was looking at that that a couple weeks ago and I had no you didn't you never heard that before just say you've never heard it before I read something kind of like that the other no you did not quit giving grounds to that demon call it for what it is I've been in the message for 39 years and I've never seen that before where did you get that that is amazing John never said anything about out never BR bragged about outrunning him but even so much more that when he got to that Revelation he looks in he verifies it in the word and he says going in First Peter amen and you preach it amen that's the bride amen will scream and holler anytime somebody says John represents the bride let's do it about that I I don't need to tell myself first the scripture says he believed that's right he was the one that believed before I don't need to preach it first let let those people think that brother saw it first why can't we deal with the demon of Pride and do that yeah we won't think for a second that it would be kosher to walk around and tell people how strong we are how good-looking we are how much money we got blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but you let somebody think that somebody else got a revelation before we got it I got to go back how can I word my conversation to be like you remember three weeks ago when we were talking oh you don't remember that yeah I said that about we better get real with ourselves that's right that's a demon a devil of Pride that would cause that that's right Amen brother brandom demonstrated this in his life remember throwing darts the testimony yes never win a game of darts darts but when they're not playing a game he can sit there and throw a bulls eye every time that's how much he killed pride in his life yeah if there's any joy to be had in winning let my brother have it let's start dealing with him the way that the prophet taught us to deal with him brother brandom's pig hunting there's a pig contest he kills the biggest pig shows up there's an old man there who's in first place until brother brandom shows up remember what meant something to brother Brandon that's right right this is not him showing up to a mechanic show with the best built car this is a hunting contest this is real this is important this is life or death whether you believe it or not I redo this in my mind now that I've read this quote about Mary and I'm repulsed of how I would have handled this situation actually I'm not if it would have been a pig contest I would have cared less if this was a big buck contest and I show up with the biggest one right before closing time and there's an old man there who's in first place and he's going to win a rifle I would have gave him the rifle after I won it and I would have felt good about my myself that's the truth and that would be wrong and that would be a demon of Pride working in my life why can't I show up and I've got one that's 10 inches bigger than his and be like close the tailgate don't need to show anybody anything why am I even in a big buck contest to begin with let's start dealing with that unless there's free stuff involved if there's free stuff involved then it's fair game I'm saying do I would I really need to be in a big buck contest what's that serving this guy right here he gave us live examples but I'm going to go one step further because I think through a little bit of prayer and maybe some fasting I can get to this point but now you have the seventh vile Angel who I can show you in the scripture where my position is at I'm sorry Saints but brother brandom can't be with us here this evening he had an emergency in his family and he had to go yeah I'm here oh he just lied about me so that he could get people here right I'm not here I'm not here all right I'm not here all right I would have walked on the platform I would have waved and I would have left and I would have been feeling good about myself because I didn't chastise that man in front of everybody that all I did was I walked on there and waved to let them know that he was lying that's right God I say I'm coming up short saint I'm coming up short but I'm done not hunting him down and I'm done not calling him for what he is I'm going to say if I can't just keep my mouth shut and walk out of that building and let him have whatever positive influence he can have on the people if I can't do that he's not the problem I'm the problem saints of God it's going to go against everything that is in our flesh it is going to go against everything that is in our hybrid Spirit it is a total another level but so is the creative spoken word being on your tongue and if you want one you better get the other one first there is no power of the spoken word coming onto a tongue that has pride in it it's too great of power there's too much damage can be done it is not going to happen amen and even more so the creative word of God to come into my life to literally manifest Jesus Christ on this Earth and to physically change my atoms that is not going to happen with pride brother random says if you have one ought in your heart against any person sinner or Saint we can go along with 50% of that that he says ought against sinner or Saint you're in danger of Hellfire not just of not being bride not just of being backslid you have one ought in your heart against a sinner or a saint that ought is there because of Pride sir and his defin his interpretation of that is is you're in danger of Hellfire that's how serious it is you remember aik in the scripture aimc would have a man come to him while he's done nothing wrong and the other man has done everything right I'm sorry the other man has done everything wrong aimc has done nothing wrong and God would come to him and say you're as good as a dead man I've done nothing wrong Lord but aimc I've not studied this out and done the history on it but and I know he wasn't Abraham but I'm not about to call him an unbeliever like I I don't know all the circumstances I'm just saying you don't get that character and that response being a rank Heathen unbeliever and not caring about or fearing God we have to understand that just because somebody's not recorded in the Bible like Abraham was doesn't mean that God wasn't doing some stuff in A's life he may have been doing the exact same thing in aim's life that he was in Abrahams it's just Abraham was predestinated for this specific thing and to be recorded in the scripture yeah amen let's not look negative towards him this was a man that could this was a man that could stand before God and say you know the Integrity of my heart right I claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ the Spotless virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ and I'm telling you I still wouldn't say that without a stutter and here's a man that would stand before the message of the hour that would stand and say Lord you know the Integrity of my heart in other words you judge me yeah right I'm an open book you judge me yeah why could he do that cuz aimc knew he didn't have any pride in there yeah and he proved there wasn't any pride in there because God says this is what's wrong you go do this and he lickly split went and did it he didn't say well I no he said if that's the way it is and that's the way you say I've got to handle it it's done yeah why no Pride I'm telling you Saints me being aimc um God told me to do this yes God speaks to me as well you believe this if you want to but I didn't even mean to say that but that's the truth yeah that's the truth that's the raw honest truth yes Abraham God speaks to me as well I hope it's getting real saints it's way late on a Wednesday night for it not to be real I hope it's getting real do we see ourselves yes sir yes Abraham God speaks to me as well and he's told me that you've deceived me but Abraham because God knows the Integrity of me my heart this is how I'm going to handle things because this is how God what God told me to do I don't read that in the scripture I read God coming to this man and saying there's a problem he says Lord you know the Integrity of me heart just tell me what to do this is what's wrong this is what you need to do yes Lord and oh by the way have that guy that's a liar pray for you yes Lord who being made in the image of God took upon himself no reputation no reputation in the beginning what God Eve's got Eve in trouble was her Pride Eve looked at the tree and couldn't see anything wrong with it and because Eve looked at the tree and she couldn't see anything wrong with it then surely there's not a problem because if there was a problem I mean I would I'm the wife of Adam I would see the see the problem like yeah the Slick talk tongue serpent wasn't what deceived Eve what deceived Eve was Eve she thought because I can look at the tree and I don't see anything wrong with it surely I can't be wrong brother random says we were put here to do what Pro prove to Satan that we're not like the first Eve you say well I would never touch those denominations I would not fornicate the word I would but yet we'll stick our head in a dirty television and thinking that we won't have the effects on it that brother Brandon said it would have on us we'll stick our nose in Hollywood and think that it won't have the effect because we can't see anything wrong with it surely it's not what brother brand was talking about if he said it's wrong it's wrong yes doesn't matter whether you agree with it or not doesn't matter whether you can see what's wrong with it or not if he said keep your head out of it he said keep your head out of it if he said keep your head out of it take it as grace and mercy from God to keep you from something that you don't even understand you want to know why there's mental illness on this planet television amen you want to know why people are calling me every day wanting me to get the hidden men out of their house and the bugs out of their house and the listening devices and the cameras that are hidden in their house Television right you want to know why it's exploding social media y the human brain cannot sit in front of something and process images at the rate that people are putting them in their brain their brains are frying their brains are frying yeah in so much that brother random says when that when the plagues come on the earth those are not natural things that's in their imaginary mind they are not real he says the things that they are seeing they are not real it's in their imagination but you try to convince them they're not real can't do it right it is real to them why is because they looked at the tree they heard the voice and they say well I don't think he really meant exactly what he said we do the same thing and we will get the same results if you think you won't get the same results as the world it's your pride telling you that amen right true amen go against the words of the prophet and think that you won't reap the same thing in your natural body that the world reaps that is your pride telling you that and I'm here to tell you you're wrong stick your head in that television stick your nose in Hollywood stick your nose in that social media fry your brain with your cell phone and all those images over and over and over and day after day 500 images in 60 seconds your brain cannot handle that it cannot upload that it cannot process that you will fry yourself amen true and you'll still have the Holy Ghost got a quote for it brother Brandon says you can lose your mind and still have the Holy Ghost don't think just because you're still the Bride of Jesus Christ that you cannot ruin your natural body by going against what the prophet told us not to do some of the warnings that he gave us absolutely were spiritually minded some of the things were absolutely natural some of them were both amen true amen don't be like the first Eve and just because you can't see why the prophet was saying this I'll go ahead and do it if brother brandom says don't mix marriages don't mix marriages you don't have to understand it do it and see what happens you might be dead and gone before it manifests itself but that's what brother random says lot did he says lot did not consider his children when he went to Sodom mix your marriage marry an unbeliever which brother brandom emphatically said never to do amen marry an unbeliever see if it don't have destruction coming down your path amen you may be dead and gone when it arrives but I assure you it's coming you cannot go against the word of God and not have it happen just because you can't see why he gave the warning yeah or why he said it don't worry about it just do it or don't do it based on what he said don't give your all to Christ and see if you come out better than the world don't give your all and see if you come out better than the world the only reason that we are in a better position than the world as Saints is because we have given ourself to Christ period by his grace we have given oursel over to him even if it's not in fullness yet we have given some portion of oursel over to him and that is the only reason that we are anywhere better off than the world don't give all and see if you don't end up just like the world we are not called to partiality we are called to fullness you want your kids to go astray keep your career before the house of G you want to lose your kids to the world to the sin to the flesh to the devil you as parents don't give all to God keep your career first keep your resident your residence first keep your close family first and you know easily Fellowship certainly whatever you do whatever you do don't forsake all and move to Lima best thing that I ever did since not because it's Lima not because of the pastor not because of you people it's because God said go and I said I don't want to and he says I supernaturally showed you and answered your prayer of what to do with your life you go and I said I'm gone to he has done financially what I would never even imagine in my world and that's the least of my concerns I have grown spiritually at a rate like under Miracle Grow and fluorescent lights amen and that's secondary to what I've seen happen in my family amen now that I have a family family when he says do something just do it and don't hold back when it came to the point in time that we had our second child on the way and I realized we can't be driving two hours both ways for service twice a week Saints I never prayed whether I should move to Lia the fact came up that now that we have these children I can't be in every service when the doors are open if I'm still residing 2 hours away I don't need to pray I need to move what if I don't is the question what if I don't and William comes to the age of accountability and he starts stepping off into the world and now I'm on my knees remember the Deliverance is in the commandment and I'm on my knees begging God SA save my boy my little William my precious little William save him save him and he says remember 12 years ago when I told you to give all and you still wanted to stay down south because it's better deer hunting let's make it real saints you put yourself there why aren't you giving all I'm not saying you're not but if you're not why not pride is why not you say well it's my career it's not it's Pride why did you care about your career if you don't have pride your financial well-being Pride your family status Pride your house Pride the scripture says it's all vanity the only thing that separates us from the world is if we have the ability to give all to die to Pride and to give all as the musicians come in the invasion of the United States

place where I'm thinking about how many will attend my meeting yes sir the devil invading the United States you go back and you listen to this tape you tell me if you think he was playing games you tell me if you'd think he wasn't been sincere you tell me you if he was just been flippant he is broken and saying the devil has invaded the pull pits and the United States and the churches and everything even he's invaded Me Myself and his manifestation of that is Lord I'm beginning to wonder how many will attend my meetings let's stand together please look at the example that he's given us compare that to where we're at he doesn't say Lord I'm beginning to lust after women Lord I'm beginning to count the finances Lord I'm beginning to his interpretation of the devil invading him is Lord I have got to the point I'm wondering how many is going to be attending the meeting why do you care how many is attending the meeting unless there's Pride see what he's dealing with pride pride see how it reveals itself how it exposes itself in the seventh angel I'll remind you who has a position in the scriptures I can show you very clearly would come to the point he would say Lord no he certainly wouldn't say Lord he would say Bill how don't you think you going to be at that meeting you think you'll get more than the last one you think the people will show up more an invasion of a devil true I'm going I want to close with this prayer heavenly father I'm so thankful for the god this is just after he told the story of being up on the mountain this is in 1962 right before the seals break heavenly father I'm so thankful for the god the one who leads me oh sometimes you can play something softly sometimes I can't hear him around me I get scared I want him close to me because I don't know what time I'm going to run up on the river I want him to be near me don't never leave me Lord right I can't talk I can't preach I can't hunt in the woods I can't fish on the bank I can't drive my car there's nothing I can do without you there was a point in time that I think he would have prayed like this I can't talk I can't preach I can't drive my car there's nothing that I can't do without you but now now God has come and dealt with this man and now right before the seals break he would include in his prayer Lord I can't even hunt that's right I can't even fish without you that's not coming from a man who thought he was a pretty good Woodsman thought he was a pretty good Boatman quite The Boatman this is another level Saints you want the seals to break in your life come to this point they'll break you meet him there they'll break let's pray together Lord Jesus father I pray that you would take the words that have been spoken and the inspiration that you laid on my heart on this father God I am embarrassed of how lengthy I've been but Lord you know that I didn't stand her and preach this of my own being Lord I didn't even stand here and preach this because I wanted to Lord I didn't even stand here and preach this because I felt like it you you know father Lord there is many here that has worked and they are tired in the flesh but father I pray that you would change our lives tonight father this has this has been unacceptable in length for a Wednesday night service but I pray that it would not just be a Wednesday night service father because if this was just another Wednesday night service I embarrassed of how long that I have went but if this has been you to come and reveal something to Benjamin seola how he needed to change and if this has been you in the foolishness of preaching to come and speak to your bride that you love to inspire them that there's another level that we need to come to then it's not been in vain Lord and then the time is accept acceptable and being here all night is acceptable father I pray that you would somehow let us snap out of carnality and forget about a clock and be real with you tonight God come and change our lives Lord may we snap out of this dimension and come up higher Lord may we not leave here just concerned about how long the preacher went what we have to do still yet tonight before we go to bed how early we have to get up to go to work God may you come here Lord you you know that I came from work and I came here and preach this and I'm going back to work if there's anybody to be tired I can be tired but I value this Revelation that you dropped in my heart two months ago so much and I know that what it has done for me Lord I'm praying that somehow you would come through a supernatural mystical Channel and drop that into the hearts of this children these people tonight may we put tiredness to the side may we put the world to the side may we put our jobs to the side may we not as we so as I have so often done just said yeah that's a good message that's a good principle what do I got to do next what do I got to do tomorrow I got to get I got to deal with the kids God may you do something Supernatural here tonight may you change us literally change our hearts Lord take all Pride from us may we be humble may we have the mind of Christ not that we would forsake the revelation of where we come from or where we're going but we may we make ourselves of no reputation here tonight in so much that we would die even to the clock that we would let you have your way with us father I've done all that I know to do I just pray that you will do the same in the hearts of these people that you've done in my heart and more so we yield ourselves to you fully Lord and we want to Echo your Prophet father I cannot even work without you I cannot hunt without you I cannot fish without you I cannot preach without you I cannot hear preaching without you I cannot come to church without you I cannot drive my car without you I am a mess I am not squared away I do not have my act together I need Revelation I need your Holy Spirit in my life you have got to take my hand and change me I

I need more of God Amen you know so many times I'm praying on God how will we go to the next level Lord I want to go higher with you I just found the way to the next level and once again the way up is down we found that the enemy was so close [Music] cuz the enemy is me we find ourselves once again in the garden we have to make a decision which tree we eat off of say God help me to die to self like I've never died to S we didn't realize how many depths and how many layers it was going to be when we began this journey of dying out but God has exposed it so that he can deal with it I believe it with all my heart God has opened this channel so that he can do a work in our lives not just to open a channel to make us miserable and say I'm finished to open the channel so he can say I understand I want you to understand so I can come and help you I wrote down two lines while he was preaching and I wrote it if we can help ourself maybe he will let us just think about that if we can help oursel maybe he'll let us if we can't help oursel maybe he will amen I've come to the place where when it comes to this I can't help myself I need him to come and help me but what he's asked me to do is humble myself the scripture said humble thyself brother B preached the message on it humble thyself one thing I can do and he's given me the power to do is humble myself and lay myself down down and say God what I heard today is true now would you come and help me will you forgive me for my pride will you forgive me for my Envy will you wash that out of me Lord and continue to reveal it to me we've had such a good example even brother Ben laying himself bear as an example was a good example same God help me to be real and honest and truthful and lay myself bear and God is good friends you know what he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle and she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him she's going to be so much like him she will even be him he's going to have it and he's using the word to make sure he'll have it the word is creating it in our lives we just need to receive it amen let's sing this song do you know let's just sing this song together I don't know the title of it hopefully brother Ben can find it but when he when he reached down his hand for me he had to reach way down for me he didn't pluck me off the pristine shelf of good Christians that I want to make my bride that's not where he found me I don't know where he found you but I wasn't on that shelf I was down in the muck and the mire of the world I was lost and undone without a hope in this world Amen he didn't pull me off the good Christian candidate shelf but he reached way down and I don't ever want to forget what I was without him and what I am today without him let us never forget that you going to sing this together once my soul was astray from the heav friendly way and was wretched and file as could be but my sa P above gave me peace joy and love when he reach down his hand for for when he reach down his head for [Music] me when he reach down his hand for [Music] me I was lost and undone without God only son when he reach down his head for me oh I was nearing despair when he came to me there and he showed me that I could be free then he lifted my feet gave me Glory complete when he reach down his head [Music] for when he reach down his hand for [Music] me when he reached way down for [Music] me I was lost and undone now God holy son [Music] his for amen let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy God it's your mercy that'll expose the devil hiding in our lives it's your great love to us Lord that won't allow that hiding spot to stay but you'll peel it back and you'll expose it Lord Lord all I can say is I'm ashamed of myself Lord I'm ashamed of how many times I try to make myself look good how often I defend myself feel offended get angry but I'm not treated right God I recognize the root of all of it now is pride Lord I pray you forgive us Lord pray that you forgive me pray that you wash that out of me Lord help me to die in a greater way to myself to where I don't get so upset Lord so I don't feel offended so that I don't have to defend myself and so that I don't try always to make myself look good but help me God to die in a greater way than I've ever died before so that I can be
