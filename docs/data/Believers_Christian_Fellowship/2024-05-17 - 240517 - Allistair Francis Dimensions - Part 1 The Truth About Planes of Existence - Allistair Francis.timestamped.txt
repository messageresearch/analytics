[18:37] standing with Saints of like Precious
[18:39] Faith it's my honor to be sharing God's
[18:42] word with you and um so I really
[18:45] appreciate the invitation and uh he
[18:48] spoke to me last year and and asked me
[18:51] to come but I just couldn't make it and
[18:54] um so um this year seemed more uh
[18:57] conducive to our life there in Durban
[19:01] South Africa and I'm I'm thankful that
[19:03] God made a way for us to be here so um I
[19:07] I've got nothing new everything has been
[19:11] revealed I've got nothing special that I
[19:14] can give you all I have is to share my
[19:17] excitement and uh I I like something I
[19:20] heard brother Chad say so I just want to
[19:22] give you a little um sort of idea about
[19:26] this weekend so we're just going to have
[19:30] fun that's what he says so uh this
[19:35] evening and tomorrow evening we're just
[19:38] going to have fun with the
[19:40] word uh and to say that lightheartedly
[19:44] but I just I feel like sons of God
[19:47] Daughters of God need to enjoy the
[19:50] word and yes we have Services where we
[19:54] we speak about serious things that might
[19:56] be
[19:57] Sunday uh but there's such things to be
[20:00] excited about and um like I said when I
[20:03] was when I was here last I grew up in
[20:06] the message I've seen the growth of the
[20:08] message from its Inception in South
[20:10] Africa uh I've had a mentioned to the
[20:13] brothers brother brother Lonnie Jenkins
[20:16] I've never said this before here made a
[20:19] great impact on my life as a youth you
[20:22] visited um Newcastle uh when I was about
[20:27] 16 years old and when the word begin to
[20:29] make an impression and uh so if some of
[20:32] you didn't know he made a great
[20:35] impression in my life especially to give
[20:38] me that hunger for teaching the word and
[20:41] um so and there were many other brothers
[20:43] who came through but he was a special
[20:46] one of them and so I just want to be
[20:49] able to say that this evening so I'm I'm
[20:52] really um when I spoke to the youth last
[20:55] night I said to them I actually came to
[20:58] speak to to them the whole
[21:00] weekend I told them you know I'm not
[21:02] really interested in the older
[21:04] people uh because they've had their time
[21:06] of fun right and they've enjoyed the
[21:09] message but then some of the adults they
[21:11] said we're still
[21:12] youth so um I just meant it
[21:15] light-heartedly but my
[21:18] desire and I found in me the passion
[21:22] that God has placed in my heart is for
[21:24] the young
[21:25] people and uh in the scripture
[21:29] it said it told the disci it told the
[21:31] Hebrews to preserve the word keep the
[21:34] Commandments means to preserve the
[21:37] Commandments and how do you you know
[21:39] what preserve is it's like you add salt
[21:42] in something and make it last longer you
[21:43] put it in a refrigerator that's how you
[21:46] preserve something today in terms of
[21:47] food but how do you preserve something
[21:50] for a perpetuation for every
[21:53] generation you teach the
[21:56] youth that's what and in in the in the
[21:59] Hebrew law every Manchild had to present
[22:03] himself in the Tabernacle every year at
[22:05] least three times a year why because he
[22:08] had to be taught the truth right and
[22:11] this is it and I feel like that's that's
[22:13] my passion that's what those ministers
[22:16] did for me when I was growing up and
[22:18] that's what I want to do so um we're
[22:20] we're teaching something today and
[22:23] tomorrow and uh uh I I my desire is to
[22:27] is to make make the youth and and some
[22:31] of you maybe most of you already know
[22:33] all these things and um but it's to make
[22:36] you understand
[22:39] reality that we have in this world and
[22:42] one subject that makes us understand the
[22:45] reality of what's going on with us and
[22:47] that's what we want to we want to speak
[22:49] about today so um I'm are we ready
[22:53] brother all right so I want to uh read
[22:57] the scripture first
[23:00] uh let's see if it's on the
[23:03] screen uh we're going to read from 2
[23:05] Corinthians CH 12 verse
[23:17] 2 2 Corinthians
[23:23] 12:2 it says I knew a man in Christ
[23:27] above 14 years ago whether in the body I
[23:31] cannot tell or whether out of the body I
[23:35] cannot tell God knoweth such an one
[23:39] caught up to the third
[23:41] heaven and I knew such a man whether in
[23:45] the body or out of the body I cannot
[23:47] tell God
[23:49] knoweth verse four how that he was
[23:52] caught up into paradise and heard
[23:55] unspeakable Words which it is not not
[23:58] lawful for a man to utter Amen in the
[24:03] next scripture Mark chapter 9 verse 43-
[24:15] 45 Mark chapter
[24:17] 9 verse
[24:26] 43-45 and if thy hand offend thee cut it
[24:31] off it is better for thee to enter into
[24:34] life maimed than having two hands to go
[24:37] into hell into the fire that never shall
[24:41] be quenched where their worm dieth not
[24:45] and the fire is not quenched and If thy
[24:48] foot offend thee cut it off it is better
[24:51] for thee to enter halt that is lame into
[24:55] life than having two feet to be cast
[24:57] into
[24:59] into the fire that shall never be
[25:01] quenched amen the Lord had a blessing to
[25:03] his word you read those scriptures and
[25:06] you think how is this going to be
[25:08] fun right
[25:11] so um I want to um brother is it all
[25:16] right there we go so the subject I want
[25:18] to speak on is the seven
[25:21] dimensions the dimensions and I don't
[25:23] know if your your pastor has preest it
[25:25] I'm sure he has I'm sure that other
[25:27] ministers would have spoken it but this
[25:30] is a
[25:31] special uh has always been a special
[25:35] Revelation to me as a young man to to
[25:37] get this right uh and that's why I want
[25:40] to share it with the young people I want
[25:42] to make it as real as possible make us
[25:45] move away from
[25:47] fantasy into what it is exactly and we
[25:50] would never know these things unless the
[25:53] prophet U made many statements now you
[25:56] know the prophet didn't take a special
[25:58] subject and say we're going to speak on
[26:00] the dimensions he just you just find all
[26:02] these quotes all over the place right so
[26:05] for a title the truth about planes of
[26:10] existence the truth about planes of
[26:13] existence so the reason for that is if
[26:16] you look at Dimensions they are not
[26:19] places a dimension we've been led to
[26:22] think that heaven is a dimension it's a
[26:24] different place somewhere else far away
[26:27] and hell is under the ground like most
[26:30] Christians believe can you believe that
[26:32] they they think hell is under the ground
[26:34] The Serpent of the the the Devil is a
[26:37] lizard likee creature with horns and a
[26:40] tail and hoof for feet and a three-prong
[26:44] fork in his hand and um his demons are
[26:47] running around chasing people who died
[26:50] in sin and there's fire burning right
[26:53] and all of these things and okay that's
[26:55] hell how about all the fantasy that
[26:58] Christians have about
[27:01] heaven and it's
[27:03] false it's all false and if you still
[27:06] have those beliefs your understanding of
[27:08] the seven seal is wrong if you can't
[27:11] clear up Dimensions you get everything
[27:13] wrong amen right so they are they are
[27:17] not places that's the thing they are not
[27:20] places that are disconnected from each
[27:23] other that you need to be transported by
[27:25] some Supernatural capsule from here to
[27:28] that place right and um there are planes
[27:33] of existence that are all connected yes
[27:37] Heaven is connected hell is connected we
[27:40] want to know how they're connected every
[27:43] single Dimension is connected to your
[27:45] existence to your reality amen all
[27:50] connected so I'm going to show you uh
[27:52] and those of you who did some
[27:53] mathematics at school some of the
[27:55] children are going to enjoy this as well
[27:58] so uh you've seen this a
[28:02] cube and you know this Cube has length
[28:06] bread and height and that's what makes
[28:09] up a cube so you're looking at a cube
[28:12] and it's made up of three dimensions one
[28:14] thing is made up of three dimensions
[28:16] these are mathematical Dimensions right
[28:19] and that's easy to see but are these
[28:22] Dimensions
[28:25] disconnected they're connected for for
[28:28] that thing to exist you have to have
[28:31] three dimensions connected and you
[28:34] understand it very well because if there
[28:36] were not connected then you who are Body
[28:38] Spirit and soul are something
[28:42] strange you are one person with three
[28:45] dimensions to you and you know this the
[28:48] prophet told you this three different
[28:51] dimensions to your existence to your
[28:53] being and you are you have to be those
[28:58] things connected for the body to even
[29:00] have some kind of
[29:02] meaning right so Heaven hell Earth ether
[29:09] are all connected to
[29:12] man that's the the that's the common
[29:16] denominator man is the connection all
[29:19] those dimensions are connected to man
[29:22] they are not
[29:25] places somewhere far off or under the
[29:27] ground are dimensions of existence amen
[29:31] so I want to that's the foundation of of
[29:34] what our understanding or to be I now
[29:38] bear with
[29:39] me uh maybe some of you and this is not
[29:42] insulting maybe some of you come from a
[29:46] Catholic background maybe some of you
[29:47] come from a Pentecostal background
[29:49] Methodist Lutheran Episcopalian whatever
[29:51] it is maybe you're from a Hindu
[29:54] background maybe you're from Islamic
[29:56] background and and if you read all those
[29:58] religions all those religious beliefs
[30:00] all those Christian beliefs all of them
[30:02] is based on fantasy yeah right every
[30:06] single last one of them is based on
[30:08] fantasy which is why the rest of the
[30:10] world trying to look at what they
[30:12] believe laugh at everybody because it
[30:14] looks like you're believing in fairy
[30:16] tales and what do what do we say we say
[30:19] you know uh well you need Faith to
[30:21] believe that you don't even know why you
[30:23] believe that uh if you come from there
[30:26] and you still have those beliefs
[30:28] so if you were in Catholicism the reason
[30:32] why the doctrines were created the
[30:34] teachings were created why pergatory was
[30:36] created by the Catholics why certain
[30:39] rights and rituals and prayers and
[30:42] baptisms because they had understandings
[30:44] of heaven and hell that terrified them
[30:47] that's right amen and those
[30:49] denominations carried over and then you
[30:51] come into the message and you still have
[30:53] those if I ask some of you now to close
[30:55] your eyes and think of God in heaven
[30:57] you're going to have a picture that you
[30:59] saw in Sunday School in a book if I ask
[31:02] you to close your eyes and imagine
[31:04] Howell you immediately have a picture of
[31:06] something which proves that in your mind
[31:09] and when you hear something when you
[31:11] sing a song uh of the Resurrection or of
[31:15] Heaven of the Rapture or something your
[31:17] mind is creating images which is
[31:20] actually
[31:21] fantasy right and and when we when we
[31:23] kneel down to pray and maybe that's okay
[31:27] but when we get get to the opening of
[31:29] The Seven seal the seven Thunders the
[31:31] mighty Angel descending placing one foot
[31:34] on the earth one foot on the sea and you
[31:36] operate by fantasy you're you're going
[31:39] to miss the truth which is why people
[31:42] cannot see what is happening today this
[31:44] is why many message Believers tragically
[31:47] do not see the opening of the seventh
[31:49] seal because they don't have Dimensions
[31:51] right they're going to ask you questions
[31:54] but uh the cloud that's just his head
[31:57] where is his body body what kind of
[31:59] question is that why would you have that
[32:01] question because you don't have
[32:03] Dimensions correct and where are the
[32:06] dead Saints according to Christ the dead
[32:09] Saints are not
[32:12] dead they don't need to be resurrected
[32:14] from death into life they're already
[32:17] alive we do not hold them back who are
[32:21] asleep
[32:23] right right and if you don't have
[32:25] Dimensions correct you're going to mess
[32:28] everything up and if you mess everything
[32:30] up it means your faith is Tainted
[32:33] tainted means it's weak which means
[32:36] anybody else who comes with a convincing
[32:38] argument is going to win you
[32:40] over right because what you're believing
[32:43] is actually a convincing argument right
[32:46] so how about the truth amen the truth
[32:49] about PLS of existence so these um
[32:52] Heaven hell Earth ether all form part of
[32:55] man's existence and when when we look at
[32:58] Earth and ether it's like your body
[33:01] realm right um heaven and hell because
[33:04] Earth and ether is what your body uh
[33:08] contacts everything on Earth in the
[33:09] dimension of Earth we're going to speak
[33:11] about that just now but your body
[33:13] connects to that your body connects to
[33:16] Ether whatever you speak goes into The
[33:18] Ether right you get uh communication to
[33:22] your ear Through The Ether if ether
[33:24] didn't exist you wouldn't be hearing
[33:25] anything if there were no waves e uh uh
[33:29] here for those waves to be transmitted
[33:31] you wouldn't hear so it's very much
[33:33] connected to the body realm but when you
[33:35] look at Heaven and Hell those are
[33:38] connected to your spirit and your soul
[33:40] that's what your soul picks up that's
[33:42] where influences come from they are
[33:45] connected to you how are they connected
[33:47] to you if Heaven is someplace far away
[33:49] in the
[33:50] Galaxy or if hell is some deep hole
[33:54] under the ground so what we also want to
[33:56] know is where do these things come from
[33:59] why did we why were we indoctrinated
[34:02] with these things where did we get these
[34:04] beliefs from right and this is a time if
[34:06] we say we have the open book we need to
[34:09] know the truth we need to put aside we
[34:11] need to be brave we need to step into
[34:14] Jordan by faith amen we don't need to be
[34:18] afraid to be wrong amen if we're wrong
[34:20] we're say we're wrong God teach us some
[34:22] more right but we're not going to be
[34:24] afraid to this is because I'm telling
[34:26] you this because I I went through this
[34:28] in life I saw Ministries that were
[34:30] afraid to be wrong afraid to step in
[34:33] because of fear of being wrong and what
[34:36] they came up with was stay with the
[34:38] ABCs don't get into the deep things it's
[34:41] too dangerous because it's going to
[34:42] destroy you well staying with the ABCs
[34:45] destroyed
[34:47] them because no Son of God who who has
[34:50] to come to adoption can come to adoption
[34:52] with
[34:54] ABCs so let's look at the
[34:56] interconnection right let's go to John
[34:58] 3:13 you don't have to turn in your
[35:00] Bibles you can follow up in the screen
[35:02] so we can move quicker John 3:13 now
[35:05] look at how you need to understand this
[35:08] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[35:10] but he that came down from heaven even
[35:13] the son of man which is in
[35:15] heaven now that son of man was standing
[35:17] right there on Earth and he says no man
[35:20] can Ascend up to heaven except he who
[35:22] came down from heaven even the son of
[35:24] man which is in heaven what is he
[35:26] talking about he is the son of man he is
[35:28] on on Earth but says he's in
[35:30] heaven which means can you imagine the
[35:33] faces of the
[35:35] Pharisees can you imagine the disciples
[35:38] most of the time they didn't know what
[35:39] he was talking about they kept asking
[35:41] for explanations because of the fantasy
[35:44] that they had believ
[35:46] in so he was in heaven and we know this
[35:50] phrase he was Heaven and Earth
[35:53] embraced brother baram said God and man
[35:57] met and
[35:58] joined that's what the son of man was
[36:02] amen God and man met and joined what is
[36:04] God he is heaven what is man man is
[36:06] Earth met and joined the marriage of
[36:10] Heaven and Earth glory to God and he was
[36:13] the first fruits of that he was he who
[36:16] are we as the bride we're supposed to
[36:17] become him what is becoming him we need
[36:21] to become Heaven and Earth met and join
[36:24] God and man met and join Heaven and
[36:25] Earth Embrace if you don't have
[36:28] Dimensions sorted out you're going to
[36:30] miss that whole
[36:31] thing glory to God so man and God met en
[36:35] Joy now I want to I'm I'm not going to
[36:37] read you all the quotes because I know
[36:39] you've read them I'm just going to give
[36:41] you the references and if you want you
[36:43] can get it from your pastor as well uh
[36:46] it's firstly all over the scripture
[36:48] dimensions are all over the scripture
[36:50] except you just don't see the word
[36:53] Dimensions right but they're there and
[36:56] brother bam when he speaks opens up that
[36:58] language to us so we understand what it
[37:00] is you'll find quotes in glorified Jesus
[37:03] preached 1955 present stage of my
[37:05] Ministry is one of my favorites it's
[37:07] just amazing on the way here on the
[37:09] plane I listen to it over and over again
[37:11] just to to understand more about it to
[37:13] see if I missed anything and I enjoyed
[37:15] it so much all over again uh the
[37:18] countdown message speaks about
[37:19] dimensions in influence Chicago Illinois
[37:23] U 1963 these are many of the of the main
[37:27] main messages uh just like four of the
[37:29] main messages where he speaks
[37:31] specifically about Dimensions actually
[37:33] kind of lays it out which one comes
[37:35] after the other and what the conditions
[37:37] are and what the characteristics are and
[37:39] he gives some examples about it but then
[37:41] there's places all over the message
[37:44] where he just mentions things everywhere
[37:46] that's right right so there is confusion
[37:51] and the confusions of the dimensions is
[37:53] what we want to look at and I'm not sure
[37:55] if you you're going to be able to see
[37:56] this clearly I hope can here's where it
[37:59] all started and it started with the
[38:01] Hebrews the Hebrews are the cause of all
[38:04] the trouble for us regarding the
[38:06] dimensions because when um they went
[38:09] into captivity of Babylon and they
[38:12] started learning
[38:14] Babylonian uh uh teachings and uh
[38:17] Babylonian religion which you find came
[38:21] from the Sumerians and U became part of
[38:24] the zoroastrian religion from Zoro as
[38:27] the prophet and you if you read zor
[38:29] Aster's teachings you're going to find
[38:31] an abyss and a beast in the abyss and a
[38:35] hierarchies of angels and hierarchies of
[38:38] demons and uh you never find in the
[38:41] Bible what the names of the seven of all
[38:43] seven archangels are you're not going to
[38:45] find who's the highest one who's the
[38:47] middle one what this one does and yet
[38:49] the Hebrews have an understanding of
[38:52] hierarchy of angels what you find in the
[38:54] talmud and other writings that they have
[38:56] rabbis speak about them and they become
[38:58] so crazy about it they'll be able to
[39:00] tell you which um which uh Angel does
[39:04] this and which Angel does that and which
[39:06] one is affecting you and which one heals
[39:08] you of this and which one but that's not
[39:10] in the Bible there a Babylonian
[39:13] doctrines right and while in there they
[39:16] made a diagram about a few hundred years
[39:20] or something before Christ an
[39:22] understanding they drew it out what they
[39:24] think Heaven and Earth was and it will
[39:26] shock you what they
[39:28] believed so they didn't know about a
[39:31] universe they didn't understand that
[39:33] there was a universe out there right
[39:35] they had no telescopes they had no
[39:37] vision they took Moses's writings from
[39:40] Genesis to Deuteronomy and they drew an
[39:43] understanding that they had and this
[39:45] understanding went all the way up
[39:48] believed by the church accepted by the
[39:51] Catholic Church all the way up to
[39:53] Galileo galile when the telescope was
[39:55] formed
[39:57] and Galileo galile who was said to be a
[39:59] heretic because he looked at what the
[40:01] Catholic church was teaching the
[40:02] Christians and said what you've been
[40:05] teaching was wrong because we can see
[40:07] past the clouds and the angels are not
[40:09] sitting on the
[40:10] clouds and God is not sitting on the
[40:13] clouds we can see beyond that now and
[40:15] then they had to scramble for belief so
[40:17] have a look this is what the Jewish
[40:19] tradition
[40:21] was can you see that they believe that
[40:25] the whole universe is just a ball a
[40:29] sphere and there is Earth and can you
[40:32] see that this band you you can see right
[40:35] above they've got God which is heaven of
[40:36] Heavens you'll see that in in the
[40:38] scripture and then there's the Gate of
[40:40] Heaven right down the center and then on
[40:42] on uh there Waters above the firmament
[40:45] and they believe well that's what caused
[40:47] the flood because there were there was
[40:48] this band protecting the Earth because
[40:50] there were Waters flowing in between God
[40:54] and the clouds and the sun was in our
[40:58] atmosphere can you see it clouds in our
[41:01] atmosphere and the Moon in our
[41:03] atmosphere and all the stars of the sky
[41:05] are in our atmosphere they believe the
[41:08] universe is a dis like that and all
[41:11] these things are moving within that
[41:14] sphere now look at what they believe
[41:16] hell is that black spot in there under
[41:18] the ground they called shol which in the
[41:21] writings of Enoch apparently was the pit
[41:25] now can you see there are four segments
[41:27] of the
[41:28] pit right Enoch's writings if you ever
[41:30] read The Book of Enoch which I do not
[41:32] recommend because we don't know what
[41:34] happened in there but I I did read it
[41:37] because youth questioned me about it and
[41:40] it's mad they can make quite a good
[41:43] science fiction movie Out of The Book of
[41:45] Enoch because the stories in there and
[41:47] the stories in many other things of
[41:49] Adam's first wife was Lilith and she was
[41:51] a succubus who prayed on the on the the
[41:56] the the body of men and his second wife
[41:59] was Eve so they believe Lilith was was
[42:01] in Genesis 1: 126 can you believe the
[42:03] Hebrews believe this they made us up in
[42:06] Babylon and then uh Genesis 2:7 man man
[42:10] married Eve who was his second wife and
[42:13] there's there's legends that they have
[42:16] as to as to why things happened the way
[42:18] they did and what the Gentiles were
[42:20] that's why they hated the Gentiles
[42:21] because they believed we are the seed of
[42:23] The Serpent and they were pure race
[42:27] right right and U they believe um sh was
[42:30] divided into four segments can you see
[42:32] it's a deep hole there the pit that's
[42:34] where your Christian theology comes from
[42:37] the pit and that Satan is living they
[42:40] had no idea about the core of the earth
[42:42] and uh so on one side of the pit was uh
[42:45] the sleeping Saints and uh one side was
[42:48] the demons and the the one part was was
[42:50] Satan and then the one part was those
[42:53] who were who died prematurely like Abel
[42:56] whose blood was was crying out from the
[42:58] ground and the they were trying to make
[43:00] sense of scripture but this led to the
[43:03] fantasy that we have
[43:05] today right this is for more
[43:10] than uh 3,000 years it's what they
[43:14] believed 3,000 years of mankind
[43:17] genetically it's encoded into
[43:20] you so naturally when you close your
[43:23] eyes and try to imagine you're going to
[43:24] see what was passed down by your
[43:26] ancestors
[43:27] right furthermore this progressed or
[43:31] digressed to the early church teachings
[43:34] and influenced by Gentile heathens so
[43:36] when Gentiles started reading the Bible
[43:38] and heard how the Hebrews were were
[43:40] preaching now I I must add that the
[43:43] disciples and apostles were
[43:46] Hebrews the only one who was correcting
[43:49] what they were saying was Paul which
[43:51] means they were teaching whichever
[43:53] churches they go to whatever questions
[43:55] they were answering from their Hebrew
[43:57] belief amen all they were told was teach
[44:00] the gospel um uh uh teach the
[44:03] resurrection teach the crucifixion there
[44:05] is life after death and that why do you
[44:08] think they were so mesmerized when
[44:10] Christ rose from the dead what happened
[44:12] what happened to him in shol how did
[44:15] this work you know uh um did he climb
[44:18] out of the pit can you imagine what
[44:19] their fantasies were
[44:21] like and the graves were opened
[44:27] Church beliefs some of you might laugh
[44:29] at this one this is a picture of souls
[44:32] under the
[44:35] altar which many message Believers have
[44:38] a problem with which brother brandham
[44:41] himself thought there were actual
[44:44] physical Souls under the altar until God
[44:47] showed him something amen and then he
[44:49] even thought he had a wrong idea of who
[44:52] they were that's right there is no alter
[44:56] Brazen literal to Brass altar in a
[44:59] dimension of heaven where souls are
[45:02] hiding under crying for vengeance how
[45:05] can you be in the dimension of the word
[45:07] crying for
[45:08] vengeance think about
[45:10] that
[45:12] right so these are and this is one
[45:15] aspect this is one image I've showed you
[45:17] which passed down all the way through
[45:20] even the Protestant churches believing
[45:22] in this that there are these Souls
[45:24] crying for vengeance crying to be
[45:27] Avenged of what was done to them
[45:29] according to the prophet all those who
[45:32] died uh who were crying for vengeance
[45:34] were were not in that Dimension and we
[45:37] have to tie those things together amen
[45:40] are you with me yes sir all right let's
[45:42] move on so I just want to again tell you
[45:45] if it's something you've never heard
[45:47] before or something you didn't see
[45:49] exactly the same way if it's not exactly
[45:51] wherever you come from whatever your
[45:53] pastor teaches I'm not here to change
[45:56] that I'm just sharing my excitement amen
[45:59] because of what it's done for me and how
[46:01] it's opened up my eyes to everything
[46:03] else and that's what I'd like to share
[46:05] and if it's wrong I'm willing to learn
[46:08] amen so these confusions of these
[46:11] Dimensions if you look at it brother
[46:13] brandham first understood if you can't
[46:15] read that don't even look there just
[46:16] follow me brother Bram first understood
[46:20] Heaven and Hell by Pentecostal teachings
[46:23] I'm going to show that to you right
[46:25] until God revealed Dimensions to him
[46:28] over the time of his ministry there
[46:31] wasn't even a single time in his
[46:33] ministry where he had everything right
[46:35] that's right and he admitted it so don't
[46:37] tell me I'm correcting the prophet he
[46:39] corrected himself which allowed me to
[46:42] correct myself amen amen he preached the
[46:45] coming of the Lord the resurrection and
[46:48] many other things based on Pentecostal
[46:51] understanding right which was pertinent
[46:53] for its time my dad was a a pre PR in
[46:57] Assemblies of God before he became um
[47:00] and that is Brother Steve before he
[47:02] became uh a Believer message believer
[47:05] and I remember the uh Pentecostal days I
[47:09] remember the Evangelical preachings of
[47:11] fire and brimstone I remember scaring
[47:14] people half to death that if they don't
[47:15] accept the Lord Jesus Christ Christ now
[47:17] they die tomorrow they're going to be
[47:19] burning with fire and it's going to be
[47:21] so hard they're going to call out for
[47:22] Abraham to dip his finger and cool their
[47:25] tongues because that's how they saw the
[47:27] scripture and they literally saw it as
[47:30] fantasy in that way how does a Spirit
[47:33] cool his tongue with actual
[47:36] water right now you know that but what
[47:39] happened when they were in Pentecost
[47:41] everything was so real to them like a
[47:45] fantasy
[47:47] movie I was standing uh as a a young
[47:50] person I was standing in a Christian
[47:52] bookstore uh well almost 30 years ago
[47:57] and uh I I walked in there and they had
[47:59] a video playing of the the end of the
[48:02] world and were like these people running
[48:05] around with triple six literally printed
[48:07] on their foreheads and there were people
[48:09] chasing them with axes and sword and
[48:11] there was a guillotine and all those
[48:13] people who were sons of God were being
[48:15] beheaded by these people with the mark
[48:18] of the beast and uh I I'm standing there
[48:21] and there were other Christians there
[48:23] were just shaking their
[48:25] head that time
[48:27] you know and like triple six on their
[48:30] foreheads triple the the movie makers
[48:32] literally showed triple six in the right
[48:34] hand triple six here planted on the
[48:36] forehead and and and this this world
[48:39] that's that's darkness and demons flying
[48:42] around it's
[48:43] ridiculous amen and I stood there
[48:45] feeling so sorry for them and then I
[48:47] thought Lord how grateful we are and it
[48:50] was only a teenager so grateful for the
[48:53] prophet and I don't have to live in fear
[48:55] of this thing amen man once the seals
[48:59] were opened something opened in the
[49:02] prophet that's right and it required a a
[49:05] higher understanding so you've got to
[49:08] understand speech brother Ram's speech
[49:10] in the message it's important to know
[49:12] which Ministry he is speaking in
[49:14] different times so there's times where
[49:16] in the ministry he's speaking
[49:18] Evangelical way in an Evangelical way to
[49:21] Pentecost there's times where he's doing
[49:24] exactly that warning them of hell he was
[49:27] called to do that to get them to the
[49:29] altar it was the Pentecostal age it was
[49:31] a church age right we are not in a
[49:34] church age that's right just clear up
[49:37] for those who think we we believe in an
[49:39] eth day with an eighth messenger and one
[49:41] of us is an eighth messenger and all
[49:43] that no no no the Capstone Age The Bride
[49:46] age is not a church age we're not saying
[49:48] there is another church messenger we are
[49:50] not in a church age if you believe a
[49:53] Third Exodus there was a first Exodus
[49:56] God taking a nation out of a Nation
[49:57] Israel out of Egypt a second Exodus
[50:00] where God took a church out of Israel
[50:02] and a Third Exodus where he takes a
[50:04] bride out of a church that's not the
[50:07] Rapture or the translation it is part of
[50:10] the Rapture but we've been taken out of
[50:12] church ages into a bright age there's no
[50:16] eighth messenger we never said that I
[50:18] don't know why we're accused of having
[50:20] said that I don't know who said that but
[50:23] we are not looking for some eighth
[50:25] messenger we are the bride the bride has
[50:27] a Ministry before the translation and
[50:30] our messenger is Christ the prophet told
[50:32] us that our husband is our messenger and
[50:36] he's with us he calls us his bride we
[50:38] become his wife because we are married
[50:39] to him what do we mean by married to him
[50:42] we mean Heaven and Earth embracing we
[50:44] mean Dimensions coming together because
[50:47] that's what was promised from the
[50:48] beginning that's what we mean we're not
[50:50] under some illusion yes sir of of making
[50:53] another church agent making one man's
[50:55] Ministry special that's not if they're
[50:57] telling you that about us they're lying
[50:59] they don't even know anything what we're
[51:00] saying maybe they haven't even listened
[51:02] to us clearly that's right amen so we're
[51:05] not a
[51:06] movement the bride is not a movement
[51:09] movements died and failed a long time
[51:11] ago we are we are an experience that man
[51:15] was looking for for a very long time
[51:17] that's right glory to God so we need to
[51:20] understand brother bram's speech right
[51:22] so I want to go to brother bram's first
[51:24] idea of Heaven I love this prophet he is
[51:28] the most honest I had ever seen if he
[51:31] was wrong he said he was wrong he told
[51:34] us how he believed he corrected himself
[51:36] he had the humility why shouldn't we why
[51:39] do I need to behave like I know
[51:41] everything right brother Mam's first
[51:43] idea of Heaven this is things that ought
[51:45] to be and this is uh paragraph 42 and I
[51:49] do not think that heaven is a place that
[51:52] my mother used to tell me about I
[51:55] believe that heaven
[51:57] has grow I believe that the church has
[51:59] grown from that yes sir have you grown
[52:03] from
[52:04] that right to think it used to be he
[52:07] says a 100 years ago or two I think the
[52:10] old times used to think that everyone
[52:12] that died went up to heaven and had a
[52:14] hop and set up there on the clouds and
[52:17] played a hop and they know that there
[52:19] was a place called heaven and they if
[52:21] they be so all the musicians would have
[52:23] it on
[52:25] us that's brother brother R's humor he
[52:27] saying all the gifted people would be up
[52:30] there the ones who can play music if
[52:31] everyone had hops he's trying to tell
[52:33] you I can't play a hop all the musicians
[52:36] would have it on us right but if they be
[52:38] so so it isn't playing Hops at all I
[52:41] believe I don't believe the Bible
[52:43] teaches that but that was a conception
[52:48] that they had before the fullness of the
[52:51] word come into
[52:53] existence amen or the opening of The
[52:55] Seven Seals
[52:57] he's telling you the opening of The
[52:58] Seven Seals needs to bring you the truth
[53:00] about
[53:01] heaven glory to God what more do you
[53:05] need there is one quote which tells you
[53:07] the reality of Heaven should change for
[53:09] you after you see the opening of The
[53:11] Seven Seals see that we didn't make this
[53:14] up the prophet is saying
[53:16] that right so there was his first
[53:19] understanding of hell you're going to
[53:20] see here uh
[53:22] 1957 right we read the quote from 1965
[53:25] this is 19 57 thirsting for life what's
[53:29] the trouble today we've got too many
[53:31] weak pulpits that's afraid to preach an
[53:33] eternal burning hell there it is right
[53:37] and to warn the people of things and
[53:39] letting the church go just as slothfully
[53:41] and sloppy now if I preach I know this
[53:43] because I preach dimensions then a
[53:45] brother comes and tells me you false
[53:47] because brother Brandon preached an
[53:49] eternal burning hell now as he
[53:51] progressed you know first thing he said
[53:53] is there's no Eternal burning h hell
[53:57] right because God changed his Revelation
[54:00] now he says in 1963 Souls that are in
[54:03] prison CU you see the Judgment isn't now
[54:06] there is no burning hell now somebody
[54:10] tell you the guy is in burning hell now
[54:13] that's
[54:15] wrong of course during that time he had
[54:17] major conversations with the
[54:19] denomination and told them you can't
[54:21] have an eternal hell because if people
[54:23] are in there for eternity you know it
[54:25] then they have eternal life and eternal
[54:27] life is God and God canot be in
[54:29] hell so you know that so can you see
[54:33] that he's understanding progressed from
[54:35] the early part of his ministry he was
[54:36] preaching from a Pentecostal background
[54:38] it was needful when it was the Elijah
[54:41] Ministry smashing Ahab and Jezebel and
[54:45] calling for the elect but when it
[54:47] switched to the Eliza Ministry the seven
[54:49] seal had to open the seals had to be
[54:52] revealed and things had to change for a
[54:55] bride
[54:56] because she had to be called out by this
[54:58] new Revival of the open book descending
[55:01] glory to
[55:02] God so what do we believe now what we
[55:06] believe now affects our understanding of
[55:10] everything number one the Rapture if you
[55:13] don't get Dimensions right you don't get
[55:15] the Rapture right right you don't get
[55:17] the resurrection right you're going to
[55:19] be still confused but brother Chad what
[55:21] about the bodies how will it happen what
[55:24] about Jesus's body what happened here
[55:26] what what happened I don't understand
[55:27] I'm confused why are you confused
[55:29] because you don't have Dimensions right
[55:32] the translation what's it going to be
[55:34] like what was Elijah's Chariot was it a
[55:37] real Chariot does God have real horses
[55:39] of fire in heaven pulling a chariot is
[55:43] that what elishah
[55:44] saw what was it so if you have fantasy
[55:48] you're not going to know you're going to
[55:51] be confused you're going to be expecting
[55:53] that yes I know there's quotes where
[55:54] brother bandam talks about horses
[55:56] he's talking about the Saints coming
[55:58] Enoch talks about it yes we know all
[56:00] that but now the seven seal is opened
[56:03] amen the reality of the dimension of
[56:06] Heaven needs to open to you glory to God
[56:09] the seven seal the seven
[56:12] Thunders if everything is like that this
[56:14] is why people don't understand because
[56:17] they're expecting a real
[56:20] angel Christ to come down with uh uh his
[56:25] face shining like the sun with a literal
[56:28] open book in his hand like God needs a
[56:31] literal book made with pages of wood
[56:33] from
[56:35] Earth right and his feet like brass and
[56:38] then he literally stands on the the sea
[56:41] and on the earth which is why many of
[56:43] the original first second generation
[56:46] preachers believed that the seven seal
[56:49] could not be open because the mighty
[56:51] Angel has not literally descended
[56:54] yet so if if it hasn't yes then we are
[56:58] Leia we are Leia we are wretched
[57:00] miserable poor blind and naked there has
[57:02] been no Third Exodus yet we are a church
[57:05] age that's who we are yes sir and
[57:08] everything brother B spoke in 1965
[57:10] doesn't exist right if you don't have
[57:13] dimensions that's what you're expecting
[57:15] that's right then you're going to make
[57:17] up fantasies about the seven
[57:19] Thunders booming voice all of those
[57:21] things what's it going to do right
[57:24] casting out of demons oh oh my goodness
[57:27] praying for the sick when you don't have
[57:30] dimensions and and most of the people
[57:32] who love casting out demons are actually
[57:35] afraid of demons that's right they use
[57:37] the the the tradition of casting out to
[57:40] overcome their own
[57:41] fear right you don't need to go there
[57:44] and and and and uh uh pretend you don't
[57:48] need to go there and act like you
[57:50] casting out Devils right how do we know
[57:52] you're afraid because you take 10
[57:54] Brothers with you to sing
[57:56] oh the blood of Jesus hold your hands
[57:59] together everyone eyes closed let's why
[58:01] can't you go alone amen you're terrified
[58:05] you're terrified that you the bride of
[58:07] Christ can be overtaken by a
[58:10] demon if you understand Dimensions you
[58:13] know that when that demon comes into my
[58:16] presence it runs
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] away they shouldn't be in your church
[58:22] today if they come in here they must
[58:24] leave without us costing them them out
[58:27] we know it from the word if the word is
[58:29] being spoken the word is supreme the
[58:31] word is him how can Heaven and Hell
[58:36] survive together in one place what are
[58:39] demons doing in your church in a bride
[58:41] church I understand if it's in leoda
[58:44] yeah people frothing at the mouth and
[58:47] speaking in some other language and
[58:49] acting weird and and then you got to
[58:51] fight with the thing to come out that's
[58:53] not a son of man Ministry he didn't go
[58:56] there and sing all the blood he didn't
[58:58] chant he didn't have a prayer meeting he
[59:00] came to the demon and said leave
[59:03] him and that's it he stepped on the
[59:06] shore and the demons ran to him and said
[59:08] what do we have to do with you why are
[59:09] you tormenting us that's who you are you
[59:13] don't have to lay hands on them you
[59:14] don't even have to touch them they must
[59:17] run from you if you have Dimensions
[59:19] correct they are afraid of you you don't
[59:21] need to have any fear of them we don't
[59:23] need to have those services to cast out
[59:25] demons
[59:27] what are they doing in your churches
[59:28] when you have the pure word of God
[59:32] something is wrong you need to question
[59:34] that a lot of people don't like that
[59:36] because they like the idea of I don't
[59:38] need to feel powerful to cast out a
[59:41] devil I don't I need to feel powerful to
[59:44] overcome my own
[59:45] failures that's it I already know he
[59:48] said don't you know the demons are
[59:50] already subject to you you you don't
[59:52] need to to be to feel great about that
[59:55] you should rather feel great that your
[59:56] name is written in heaven glory to God
[1:00:00] preaching salvation will change if you
[1:00:03] get Dimensions right prayer towards God
[1:00:06] prayer is such a big thing it's such a
[1:00:08] victory if you pray with fantasy it's
[1:00:11] not a
[1:00:12] victory that's how much this can change
[1:00:15] your life if you get Dimension
[1:00:17] straighten out all right so if we don't
[1:00:19] get it straighten out our faith is weak
[1:00:21] in all aspects of the word so I don't
[1:00:23] know where this diagram came from I hear
[1:00:26] tell part of it was put together by
[1:00:28] Brother Lonnie Jenkins I don't know or
[1:00:32] brother bisol or whoever it is but we're
[1:00:34] going to use it just to have you seen
[1:00:36] this
[1:00:37] before no no
[1:00:41] why they showed it to us in South Africa
[1:00:44] when they
[1:00:45] came what happened to
[1:00:48] you so this was taken by some of those
[1:00:52] great pioneering Elders in the message
[1:00:55] and we thank God for them they put this
[1:00:57] I saw this back when I was a teenager of
[1:01:00] course it was a little different I kind
[1:01:02] of uh they had it uh pictures with it
[1:01:05] and the Seven golden candlesticks they
[1:01:07] did a fantastic job I just uh simplified
[1:01:09] it so that you can see things clearly
[1:01:11] and understand so basically what we have
[1:01:13] there in the center that that thing that
[1:01:16] looks like the globe that's Earth
[1:01:18] according to what brother bandham
[1:01:19] teaches that is light matter time we are
[1:01:22] living in three dimensions of light
[1:01:24] matter time and if you're going upwards
[1:01:26] the regions of Angels the region of the
[1:01:29] Blessed is the sixth
[1:01:31] Dimension seventh is God dimensions of
[1:01:35] existence seventh is the existence of
[1:01:38] God Amen sixth is the the existence of
[1:01:41] angels and the existence of the the the
[1:01:44] the Blessed who have died and are there
[1:01:46] in the sixth Dimension it's the
[1:01:47] existence of theophany right and
[1:01:50] incomplete theophany hold that thought
[1:01:54] then The Fifth Dimension the tells us
[1:01:56] was is divided was divided into four
[1:01:59] we'll talk about that just now uh which
[1:02:01] that little corner there I've got
[1:02:03] paradise and then is the regions of the
[1:02:05] lost that is those who died without
[1:02:07] believing or rejecting the word regions
[1:02:10] of demon Spirits lower than that and
[1:02:13] Hell itself which is Satan amen the
[1:02:17] father of all lies right so this is
[1:02:19] where we are and this is how brother
[1:02:21] bandam kind of sets it up in present
[1:02:23] stage of my Ministry and he speaks about
[1:02:25] it saying going up this way going down
[1:02:27] this way and he sets it this is how it
[1:02:29] is right so that I want you to imprint
[1:02:31] it in your mind tomorrow we're going to
[1:02:34] use the same diagram to show you how the
[1:02:36] dimensions shifted and changed from the
[1:02:39] beginning till now that's why I say
[1:02:41] we're can to have lots of fun with it
[1:02:43] all right so Dimensions here's the
[1:02:46] important facts the number of Dimensions
[1:02:49] vary with regard to each person who
[1:02:51] speaks about it so Christ spoke certain
[1:02:55] things about Dimensions spoke about
[1:02:57] heaven he spoke about hell he spoke
[1:02:59] about Earth Paul spoke about uh the
[1:03:02] first second third heaven three
[1:03:03] dimensions remember we read in the
[1:03:05] beginning which one it was we don't know
[1:03:08] right and then we have brother Bram who
[1:03:10] came and spoke about seven
[1:03:12] dimensions when Paul spoke of the third
[1:03:15] heaven he based it upon access right in
[1:03:18] other words a first Heaven which you can
[1:03:20] get to First a second one so it wasn't
[1:03:23] like uh first was on the top and second
[1:03:26] below and third below he spoke about it
[1:03:28] as access right so and that's how
[1:03:31] brother bham put it there as well and
[1:03:33] I'll explain that when brother brandom
[1:03:35] laid it out mysteriously he did the same
[1:03:37] thing he put it according to access to
[1:03:40] go upward there's the sixth first then
[1:03:43] the seventh right in other words if if I
[1:03:45] was a theologian and uh because we're
[1:03:48] we're humans who are mainly OCD all the
[1:03:51] time we want things to be according to
[1:03:53] certain order we'll start with the First
[1:03:55] Dimension at top and we'll label it 1 to
[1:03:57] seven going downwards right and brother
[1:04:00] baram didn't he put seven on the top six
[1:04:03] beneath 1 2 3 and then five at the
[1:04:06] bottom and you see on the side there's
[1:04:08] the fourth dimension which is the
[1:04:10] dimension of
[1:04:11] communication okay so 1:7 is now I'm
[1:04:15] going to tell you the mystery behind how
[1:04:17] he put it 1: 7 is based on easiest to
[1:04:22] hardest to access
[1:04:26] in other words it's you are you are
[1:04:29] basically now accessing light matter
[1:04:30] time that's where you're living today
[1:04:33] man is more able to access the realm of
[1:04:37] communication and Hell than it is for
[1:04:40] man to access
[1:04:41] Heaven All Men on Earth are all
[1:04:44] accessing communication and they're
[1:04:47] accessing hell they're accessing hell
[1:04:49] more than
[1:04:51] communication so in level of how
[1:04:54] difficult it is right right and we know
[1:04:57] this because even you know brother R
[1:04:59] speaks about the witches and wizards and
[1:05:01] people who can who are like clevan or uh
[1:05:05] people who can speak to the dead not the
[1:05:08] fakers the real ones like the witch of
[1:05:11] Endor they're actually brother B says
[1:05:13] they're like a radio that picks up
[1:05:15] frequencies says those frequencies are
[1:05:17] moving through the room right now if
[1:05:19] there's a radio why was he even saying
[1:05:20] that in the seals because he was a radio
[1:05:23] picking up a frequency with a gift and
[1:05:25] there Angels moving through and all he
[1:05:27] was doing was echoing what was being
[1:05:29] spoken glory to God so it is easier for
[1:05:33] man to access hell and communication and
[1:05:36] we know this since from the beginning
[1:05:39] the way to the tree of life was
[1:05:41] blocked right so Dimensions important
[1:05:45] was not created from the beginning from
[1:05:49] before the Earth began God didn't create
[1:05:51] hell hell was there was no hell
[1:05:54] existence there was no Fifth Dimension
[1:05:57] when God was creating uh uh the universe
[1:06:00] the hell was only created after he took
[1:06:03] Lucifer of the earth that's right you
[1:06:06] know brother B says Lucifer walked upon
[1:06:07] the volcanics that's right there must
[1:06:10] have been some civilization of Fallen
[1:06:12] Angels before Adam came there and then
[1:06:15] they messed around with Earth and
[1:06:18] whatever life there was they put the
[1:06:20] earth into a without form and void
[1:06:23] condition because after they were struck
[1:06:25] down from Heaven they were struck down
[1:06:26] to earth when they lost their existence
[1:06:29] they they had an Earthly existence and
[1:06:31] when God was going to create man he took
[1:06:33] them out of an Earthly existence and
[1:06:35] hell was created right and we'll speak
[1:06:38] more about that just now so not all
[1:06:41] these these these Dimensions were just
[1:06:43] there from the beginning waiting to be
[1:06:45] filled places that just existed right
[1:06:48] they are Realms of existence PLS of
[1:06:52] existence hell cannot exist unless
[1:06:54] there's a creature of hell that's right
[1:06:58] Earth Light matter time there are
[1:07:00] creatures of light matter time the realm
[1:07:02] of angels cannot be unless there are
[1:07:04] angels angels are in existence a realm
[1:07:08] of God cannot exist unless there is God
[1:07:11] it's a realm of existence glory to God
[1:07:14] so they evolved according to the
[1:07:16] relationship of God to man don't stumble
[1:07:19] over the word evolved brother BR says I
[1:07:22] believe in evolution just not the way
[1:07:24] they say amen amen things
[1:07:27] evolve let's get to light matter time so
[1:07:31] Dimensions 1 2 and 3 light matter time
[1:07:34] you love him
[1:07:35] Saints are you having fun all right so
[1:07:39] where we live right now in the flesh and
[1:07:41] young people this is why I said it's for
[1:07:43] you I want you to enjoy this I want you
[1:07:44] to understand it it's very simple just
[1:07:47] religion makes it complicated we want to
[1:07:50] take that away we want to make it simple
[1:07:51] to understand so where we live in the
[1:07:53] flesh this is the realm of three
[1:07:55] dimensions right now as you're sitting
[1:07:57] in this room there is length there is
[1:07:59] breadth there is height right and these
[1:08:02] are three dimensions of measurement at
[1:08:04] the same time everything in this room
[1:08:07] consists of light matter and time this
[1:08:11] is your existence the existence of your
[1:08:14] body your life on Earth if there is no
[1:08:17] light there is no existence if there is
[1:08:20] no matter there is no existence amen if
[1:08:23] there's no time there is no existence
[1:08:26] for man all three dimensions have to
[1:08:29] exist for man to exist it is the
[1:08:33] existence of mankind it is the existence
[1:08:36] of nature is the existence of animals
[1:08:38] light matter time so this is the realm
[1:08:41] brother bandam says all your senses of
[1:08:43] the flesh
[1:08:45] contact right he says there are quotes
[1:08:48] you contact the dimensions through your
[1:08:50] senses light is a substance
[1:08:56] light is not a thing that comes on when
[1:08:58] you turn a switch on it's a substance
[1:09:01] science tells us it has partical nature
[1:09:05] it has a
[1:09:06] wavelength it reacts differently as it
[1:09:09] moves through different mediums it
[1:09:11] reacts differently as it moves through
[1:09:13] water through glass how it hits Earth
[1:09:17] light has substance in it God said let
[1:09:20] there be light it was a
[1:09:23] thing he created it glory to God and it
[1:09:28] was created so in other words are you
[1:09:30] seeing the First Dimension coming into
[1:09:32] existence at the beginning of creation
[1:09:34] let there be light right every substance
[1:09:38] on Earth everything that you look around
[1:09:40] this Pulpit this microphone your teeth
[1:09:44] your hair your
[1:09:46] children the flowers it's all made of
[1:09:49] different kinds of
[1:09:51] matter and science is still uh Mesmer
[1:09:55] there's a whole faculty studying matter
[1:10:00] which was just created by God amen amen
[1:10:04] every substance on Earth is made of
[1:10:06] matter time I love time and I hate it
[1:10:12] too it's a lie you can't save time you
[1:10:16] can't waste time stop telling your
[1:10:18] children you wasting my time because you
[1:10:21] can't waste time time doesn't care about
[1:10:23] you time just ticks on and on you can't
[1:10:26] save time you can't waste time you can't
[1:10:28] do anything to you it's its own Master
[1:10:31] right it doesn't wait for anybody it's
[1:10:33] just ticking away but you don't realize
[1:10:36] how time affects you do you know you
[1:10:40] cannot see the Horizon if there's no
[1:10:42] such thing as
[1:10:43] time amen you can't have P perspective
[1:10:47] things moving to a point if the
[1:10:49] dimension of time does not exist right
[1:10:52] if someone throws a ball at you as a
[1:10:55] comes closer you see it getting
[1:10:57] bigger you see that if there is no time
[1:11:00] that won't exist it'll look like it's
[1:11:02] the same size moving at you like that
[1:11:04] you wouldn't even know it'll hit you in
[1:11:05] the face what tells you you need to
[1:11:08] catch it is it's growing larger your
[1:11:09] eyes picking it up it's coming to hit me
[1:11:12] time does that right right why because
[1:11:15] over a certain amount of time it's
[1:11:18] coming towards you if time doesn't exist
[1:11:21] there's no decomposition of matter that
[1:11:23] is died because decomposition occurs
[1:11:26] over a period of
[1:11:29] time right if time doesn't exist how is
[1:11:32] something born and
[1:11:34] grows we take it so much for granted
[1:11:37] it's a dimension science even Einstein
[1:11:40] couldn't understand completely they came
[1:11:43] up with ctcs they came up with uh
[1:11:46] movements of time and space continuum
[1:11:49] and uh traveling they were thinking
[1:11:51] about traveling backwards in time
[1:11:53] traveling forwards in time they had a a
[1:11:56] conference of physicists many years ago
[1:11:59] to study this thing and he still haven't
[1:12:02] gotten it right amen the the the
[1:12:04] atheists believe the Earth is 4 billion
[1:12:06] years old and they don't believe that
[1:12:08] God how God created it they don't
[1:12:11] understand they and maybe they have
[1:12:13] proof that the Earth is so many billion
[1:12:15] years old and say no you know Christians
[1:12:17] believe it it's in six days right uh
[1:12:21] when Adam was
[1:12:23] formed in Genesis 2
[1:12:26] that was his
[1:12:28] birthday but he was
[1:12:32] 21 his first day on Earth he was 21
[1:12:36] which mean God can bring something to
[1:12:39] existence with
[1:12:41] age with
[1:12:43] age so how old was the earth you just
[1:12:47] don't know you just don't know brother
[1:12:50] bam said quote it could be 4 trillion
[1:12:54] years we don't know because it existed
[1:12:57] God created the heavens and the Earth
[1:12:59] period something happened and then he
[1:13:02] began to refurbish it for man to live on
[1:13:05] in the six days of creation furthermore
[1:13:08] if the sun and the moon and the stars
[1:13:11] were only put into place on the fourth
[1:13:14] day then that's where a 24-hour cycle
[1:13:17] began because that in the fourth day he
[1:13:20] said these shall be for signs and
[1:13:22] Seasons so how was the first day 24
[1:13:25] hours right right or the second day 24
[1:13:28] hours as some Christians believe right
[1:13:31] and they accuse us of believing nonsense
[1:13:33] they just don't know because these
[1:13:35] Christians didn't have Dimensions right
[1:13:36] they didn't understand Dimensions but we
[1:13:39] do amen so on the fourth day here comes
[1:13:42] times and Seasons began which means the
[1:13:45] dimension of time
[1:13:49] changed right time actually
[1:13:52] existed in a different form and in the
[1:13:55] beginning was the
[1:13:58] word and the Word was with God what was
[1:14:01] that time like that's like Time and
[1:14:03] Eternity Blended together in some kind
[1:14:05] of form we'll never understand but the
[1:14:07] word says beginning that's right that's
[1:14:10] right so if scientists depend on carbon
[1:14:13] dating Argan dating all of that they
[1:14:15] have to have something called a constant
[1:14:18] in mathematics if your constant is based
[1:14:21] on the speed of light moving through the
[1:14:23] universe now sorry to sound so sciencey
[1:14:25] I just have to disprove it so that you
[1:14:28] we get out of the way but if your
[1:14:30] constant is based on the speed of light
[1:14:32] now what was time before the speed of
[1:14:35] light which means everything falls apart
[1:14:38] with your carbon dating and Argan dating
[1:14:40] if if the if the the Earth was 4
[1:14:42] trillion I don't know I don't even know
[1:14:44] what years were because this the Earth
[1:14:46] wasn't revolving around the
[1:14:48] Sun so it couldn't even be 4 trillion
[1:14:51] years it's based upon constants of
[1:14:54] science
[1:14:57] you older people don't worry about
[1:14:58] constant it's it's for the young people
[1:15:00] who do mathematics today I love picking
[1:15:03] on old
[1:15:06] people everything that is real to us is
[1:15:10] made up of this these Dimensions glory
[1:15:13] to God and it's beautiful isn't it you
[1:15:16] walk out every day and you appreciate
[1:15:19] the first three dimensions it's
[1:15:21] magnificent in every way every day look
[1:15:25] at how time takes us up in the morning
[1:15:28] the sun moves to the sky ends the day we
[1:15:30] have a sleep at night you have any idea
[1:15:34] there's this beautiful thing called the
[1:15:35] Circadian rhythm in your brain which
[1:15:38] your brain works with light if there's
[1:15:42] no light there's no Cadian Rhythm which
[1:15:44] occurs in the brain which wakes you up
[1:15:46] why do the birds wake up in the morning
[1:15:48] and start chirpping because the sun
[1:15:50] ignites a cycle in the sucan Rhythm and
[1:15:53] they start chirpping because and it's
[1:15:55] light that starts do you know how it
[1:15:56] works do you know when the light comes
[1:15:58] in through your window and your brain
[1:16:00] your circadian rhythm SS a moment and
[1:16:03] and tells you your bladder needs to
[1:16:04] empty wake
[1:16:07] up did you know it's light that does
[1:16:09] that morning light do you know at
[1:16:12] Darkness a certain time there's another
[1:16:15] thing that says it's dark you need to
[1:16:17] sleep sleep hormone gets in gets uh uh
[1:16:20] sent out through the brain and you go
[1:16:23] 9:00
[1:16:26] if there were no light what was going to
[1:16:29] happen light is controlling this night
[1:16:31] and day is we don't appreciate such
[1:16:34] beauty and and the things that God has
[1:16:36] done for us and you know why most of us
[1:16:39] are stressed because we found ways to
[1:16:41] make these
[1:16:42] lights so we lose sleep so you know what
[1:16:45] happens if you deny the sleep cycle at
[1:16:49] 9:00 it sets the whole circadian rhythm
[1:16:52] off put stress on the bladder the
[1:16:54] digestive system the brain cortisol gets
[1:16:57] passed down you wake up in the morning
[1:16:59] your bladder works at 2:00 in the
[1:17:01] morning wakes you up now you can't sleep
[1:17:04] right why because we're denying the laws
[1:17:07] of light matter
[1:17:09] time oh I could go
[1:17:12] on let's go on so Earth was in chaos
[1:17:16] before these Dimensions were put in
[1:17:18] order amen and so you know the prophet
[1:17:22] told us this and I I've already
[1:17:23] explained some of that so each cannot do
[1:17:26] without the other light cannot do
[1:17:28] without matter matter cannot do with if
[1:17:30] there is no light matter will freeze
[1:17:33] right um I I just explained how you
[1:17:36] can't do without time matter will not
[1:17:38] will be out of control if there's no
[1:17:39] such a thing as time so the dimension of
[1:17:42] time is not what's happening on your
[1:17:43] watch that's how we measure it it's way
[1:17:48] beyond our thinking way beyond our
[1:17:50] understanding it's it sets you know I
[1:17:53] was speaking to a doctor because uh I I
[1:17:55] love speaking to them because they tell
[1:17:57] me what science thinks they know right
[1:17:59] now and I wanted to know about age and
[1:18:02] uh I I said to him so you know about the
[1:18:05] age of man and uh how long do men live
[1:18:09] uh he said uh well according to this
[1:18:12] thing in your DNA strand it's called
[1:18:15] Tas um man should live no more than 120
[1:18:20] years old I said do you know that's in
[1:18:21] the Bible that was in the days of Noah
[1:18:25] it was set there and now that thing is
[1:18:27] depleting because of everything else our
[1:18:29] diets or denying of all the dimensions
[1:18:33] and now it's dropped down and it came to
[1:18:35] David's time and he said three score and
[1:18:37] 10 right and uh so imagine that science
[1:18:42] figures It Out by working out chemicals
[1:18:44] what our AG is and how much of time we
[1:18:46] have but God already knows that so this
[1:18:49] doctor told me somebody in the Bible
[1:18:51] must have studied
[1:18:53] genetics to get those things so
[1:18:58] accurate each cannot do without the
[1:19:01] other what is light without matter to
[1:19:03] shine through
[1:19:06] amen what what is that dimension on its
[1:19:08] own it's it's useless without matter for
[1:19:11] it to affect what is matter matter would
[1:19:14] not be seen and appreciated without
[1:19:16] light you can't have an existence
[1:19:19] without light time is the mystery
[1:19:21] because it's annoying but it allows for
[1:19:24] rest of everything that is not Eternal
[1:19:28] right everything that is not Eternal
[1:19:29] exists because time exists right and
[1:19:32] it's beautiful it's beautiful right now
[1:19:34] to not be living in eternity because it
[1:19:38] it it balances out nature things have to
[1:19:41] die for things to live if there was no
[1:19:43] time then you're going to have to eat
[1:19:45] live animals that are going to live
[1:19:46] inside of
[1:19:48] you time actually makes death possible
[1:19:51] so that you can eat that which is D you
[1:19:53] see that which is d and that you might
[1:19:55] live from that which has died time is
[1:19:58] that important and it's important to
[1:20:00] matter so because of time you can absorb
[1:20:03] things that you eat and it takes time to
[1:20:05] digest it and then it grows and your
[1:20:07] cells develop all that has to do with
[1:20:10] time it may be annoying to us cuz we
[1:20:12] can't save it we can't waste it we can't
[1:20:14] manipulate it in any way but it's
[1:20:17] working for us day and
[1:20:19] night so we appreciate it without either
[1:20:23] dimension
[1:20:25] oh without all three dimensions Earth
[1:20:27] would just go back into
[1:20:29] chaos right either Dimension without
[1:20:31] light and M or light and time you Earth
[1:20:34] will be back in chaos right both Heaven
[1:20:37] and Hell have to produce things in these
[1:20:41] three dimensions to get our
[1:20:44] attention right this is why these
[1:20:46] dimensions are important we can't have
[1:20:49] some invisible Prophet speaking to us he
[1:20:51] has to be made of light matter time God
[1:20:54] has to bring bring a pillar of fire a
[1:20:55] pillar of cloud he has to bring things
[1:20:58] within our dimension for us to see he
[1:21:01] has to uh do things within our dimension
[1:21:03] for us to hear and Satan has to do the
[1:21:07] same right if Satan was a literal lizard
[1:21:11] likee creature on the ground then he
[1:21:13] doesn't need he can just pop out of the
[1:21:15] ground right but he's a spirit he cannot
[1:21:19] do anything without a body to work
[1:21:22] through you know the prophet says so
[1:21:24] both both Heaven and Hell need the three
[1:21:26] dimensions of Earth's existence to make
[1:21:29] us believe them the fourth dimension a
[1:21:31] beautiful one I don't want to tell talk
[1:21:34] too much about it but it's it's
[1:21:35] wonderful to study how it how we uh
[1:21:38] connect to it so God didn't create the
[1:21:41] fourth dimension God created ether ether
[1:21:45] was working together with light matter
[1:21:47] time like I told you it's how we hear
[1:21:49] it's how waves have passed through ether
[1:21:52] existed from the beginning of time
[1:21:55] right beautiful uh man has only learned
[1:21:58] to manipulate ether in the last few
[1:22:02] centuries now how do we know ether
[1:22:04] existed brother B told us about how one
[1:22:06] Prophet sees what's happening there God
[1:22:09] puts these waveline he explains it like
[1:22:11] Television right you remember that like
[1:22:13] Elisha seeing what was happening in in
[1:22:15] the other King's uh uh country and then
[1:22:18] elishah is a spy who was a master of
[1:22:20] ether the gift of Prophecy has got to do
[1:22:23] with ether
[1:22:25] because God can transfer things through
[1:22:27] brain waves through dreams through
[1:22:30] Visions ether is beautiful because it
[1:22:32] works for us the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:35] Ghost can affect ether to make gifts
[1:22:38] work in the
[1:22:40] church
[1:22:42] vibrations if you don't it's it's a
[1:22:44] shame that Christians don't know these
[1:22:46] things because the Hindus the Buddhists
[1:22:49] that have you ever heard Hindus saying
[1:22:50] om right you see them put their hands
[1:22:52] together OM they believe it's the
[1:22:54] vibration that created the universe they
[1:22:57] believe so much in ether those who are
[1:23:00] who are in different religions believe
[1:23:02] the ether works for them
[1:23:05] spiritually and yet Western Society not
[1:23:08] just America Western societ is all over
[1:23:10] the place it's UK it's Europe the West
[1:23:12] is everywhere the West is Central right
[1:23:15] so uh Western Society because we've
[1:23:18] moved away into intellect education and
[1:23:22] Atheism uh just lost lost that thought
[1:23:26] they done away with with spirituality
[1:23:29] don't understand how these things affect
[1:23:31] us except and then they call all these
[1:23:33] people who delve in astrology and all
[1:23:35] those kind of things they call them like
[1:23:37] you know um uh
[1:23:39] soothsayers they don't understand
[1:23:41] there's some reality in there and
[1:23:43] they're being affected so what did
[1:23:44] science do they manipulated ether and
[1:23:47] formed the fourth dimension the
[1:23:49] dimension of communication right it was
[1:23:52] not realized before that the realm of
[1:23:54] communication brother bam calls it
[1:23:55] science telecommunication television
[1:23:58] satellit cyberspace can you imagine this
[1:24:02] realm of existence was created by
[1:24:08] man you say existence yeah how many of
[1:24:11] you have a cyber
[1:24:14] footprint how many of you have an
[1:24:16] address in cyber space and know address
[1:24:19] is where people
[1:24:20] live today more young people live in
[1:24:24] Snapchat Instagram that's their
[1:24:29] existence they exist more they can say I
[1:24:32] love you I'm sorry uh I I care so much
[1:24:36] for you they can do that on on on on
[1:24:39] WhatsApp on Facebook in cyberspace
[1:24:42] Through The Ether but when they face to
[1:24:44] face
[1:24:46] they they can't exist in reality anymore
[1:24:49] in light matter time they exist in
[1:24:52] cyberspace there's a new existence of
[1:24:54] human beings in the fourth
[1:24:57] dimension they hiding in Mom's basement
[1:25:01] and think that they have a life in
[1:25:03] cyberspace this is a new existence that
[1:25:05] occurs because of
[1:25:07] Technology it's a realm that makes use
[1:25:10] of invisible waves that exist in the
[1:25:12] universe amen records brother brandom
[1:25:15] says it records words actions images and
[1:25:18] even thoughts that's right yes Lord this
[1:25:22] Dimension is created by man
[1:25:25] ether existed from the beginning of time
[1:25:28] right and now today it has been
[1:25:30] manipulated by man so let's get to the
[1:25:35] favorite The Fifth Dimension and I want
[1:25:38] to start with what hell is not right
[1:25:42] this is not hell there is no edge of the
[1:25:46] world where people are falling into fire
[1:25:48] and this certainly is not the devil
[1:25:52] forgive me for the artist ression this
[1:25:55] is not and this is a a mild one compared
[1:25:58] to what they have uh all those things
[1:26:01] about you saw the the the the goat
[1:26:04] beet you know with a five-pointed star
[1:26:07] his horns are are two parts his ears are
[1:26:10] two parts and his beard have you seen
[1:26:11] that the upside down the pentagram right
[1:26:14] do you know where the legend of bamet
[1:26:15] came
[1:26:17] from from the goat that was let loose in
[1:26:20] the wilderness
[1:26:24] every time they encountered the goat
[1:26:26] that was that was carrying the sin they
[1:26:29] believed it was evil it was
[1:26:32] baffet that's where the legend came from
[1:26:34] this poor
[1:26:36] goat somehow it lived they expected it
[1:26:38] to die with the sins when they
[1:26:40] encountered it they had to kill it
[1:26:42] because it was the devil bringing back
[1:26:44] the
[1:26:44] sins and so started the legend of baffet
[1:26:48] Satanism is a bluff don't let the
[1:26:51] Pentecostal fool you Satanism is a bluff
[1:26:54] which depressed kids run after for kicks
[1:26:59] right they can they can worship Satan
[1:27:01] they can have a a a shrine to Satan
[1:27:05] don't be afraid of that it's totally
[1:27:07] useless it's a bluff if you know
[1:27:09] anything about demon possession it's all
[1:27:12] a bluff to create fear for one purpose
[1:27:16] to make you disbelieve it's a lie it's
[1:27:20] got no power in
[1:27:22] it do not believe in that power right
[1:27:25] it's only got power if you have fear and
[1:27:28] doubt am if you have no fear and doubt
[1:27:32] you can walk into a Satan's Shrine it'll
[1:27:35] do nothing to you there can be some
[1:27:38] five-pointed star on the floor you don't
[1:27:40] have to walk around it you can go there
[1:27:42] and rub it
[1:27:43] out it's not going to put a spell on you
[1:27:46] if you've got dimensions in the right
[1:27:48] place you got no fear no doubt young
[1:27:50] people don't be
[1:27:53] afraid don't be afraid of those Gothic
[1:27:55] children with dark eyes Shadow and black
[1:27:58] and earrings and nose piercings and
[1:28:00] they're just troubled people crying out
[1:28:02] for
[1:28:03] help the and and and your presence can
[1:28:07] set them free you don't need to run from
[1:28:09] them there are souls that crying out for
[1:28:13] Christ trapped by fear and doubt and
[1:28:16] abuse and molestation and all of those
[1:28:19] things you don't need to be afraid you
[1:28:20] are a son of God and Heaven has come
[1:28:23] down upon you you you don't have to be
[1:28:25] afraid of any of those things witches
[1:28:27] Wizards I I I've live I've lived in
[1:28:29] Africa I live in Africa I've seen a real
[1:28:33] witch she when she saw my dad and and my
[1:28:37] mom uh she was when I say a real witch
[1:28:40] and she didn't she didn't look like a
[1:28:41] pointy nose crooked nose with a cap on
[1:28:44] and no she was just somebody who is a
[1:28:47] normal person who had the ability to do
[1:28:50] something to contact the other dimension
[1:28:53] to know something about certain people
[1:28:56] one thing I learned about this was that
[1:28:59] if they tell you they spoke to your
[1:29:02] grandma who is a believer in heaven
[1:29:05] they're lying to you because witches
[1:29:07] have no contact with a sixth Dimension
[1:29:10] do not believe them anyone says to you
[1:29:12] that your grandma spoke to them walk
[1:29:14] away that's a lie right especially if
[1:29:18] your grandma to beli her if she did
[1:29:20] speak to them it's a problem it's
[1:29:23] somewhere else
[1:29:24] all right The Fifth Dimension which was
[1:29:28] hell so there's there's two things to
[1:29:29] know hell before Christ I told you we
[1:29:31] going to have fun Paradise brother Ram
[1:29:34] said he taught us there was Paradise and
[1:29:36] we know this existed because the witch
[1:29:38] of Endor was able to call up the spirit
[1:29:41] of Samuel right and she could see into
[1:29:44] that she was brother maram said she was
[1:29:45] a real clavant in our language uh right
[1:29:49] she was she was a medium she was a real
[1:29:51] medium and U and Saul went to her to to
[1:29:54] find an uh um a message from Samuel so
[1:29:58] she could literally call it up and speak
[1:30:00] to them why did that happened because at
[1:30:03] that time before Christ had come all
[1:30:06] those who died job speaks about it they
[1:30:08] went into a place of Slumber while I'm
[1:30:11] in Slumber I will have my rest but on
[1:30:14] that day I will see my redeemer remember
[1:30:15] all that paraphrasing it was the region
[1:30:18] of Old Testament Saints who died
[1:30:21] believing God and they were in a Spirit
[1:30:24] realm you say well how did she say she
[1:30:27] saw a man with a bald head and a mantle
[1:30:29] on because that's what a gift does a
[1:30:32] gift can perceive a spirit and it shows
[1:30:35] them a
[1:30:36] picture right it doesn't it doesn't mean
[1:30:39] Samuel was literally a baldheaded man
[1:30:41] with a mantle on stuck in some hole in
[1:30:44] under the
[1:30:45] Earth but a person with a gift can see
[1:30:48] the existence of a spirit what's going
[1:30:51] to call up is the picture of the person
[1:30:53] from the way they died that was back
[1:30:55] then how do we know it's changed because
[1:30:57] when brother bham saw people beyond the
[1:30:59] curtain of time they were not how they
[1:31:03] died something changed do you agree so
[1:31:06] the region of the Lost is the next SE
[1:31:09] section going down that is those who
[1:31:12] died rejecting the word for their day or
[1:31:15] accepting Satan's lie how do we know
[1:31:16] this so in the message ement brother man
[1:31:19] said Christ died he descended into hell
[1:31:23] and he walked down the corridor he
[1:31:25] dramatizing it there were those on this
[1:31:27] side it was a Chasm those on this side
[1:31:29] who who said that's the one who spoke to
[1:31:31] me was Noah that's the one who told me
[1:31:33] to pull the ark this is Abram the one
[1:31:35] Abram said that's the one who told me
[1:31:36] about the promise and the people on this
[1:31:38] side were the ones who rejected the word
[1:31:41] for every day of those Believers there
[1:31:44] was something separating them they were
[1:31:46] not together because these were
[1:31:47] Believers in cist in God Amen then below
[1:31:52] that now remember we're not saying there
[1:31:54] are four flaw in the dimension of Heaven
[1:31:57] these are four different
[1:32:01] existences okay this is not hell with
[1:32:04] you know Satan has a a four-story house
[1:32:08] no that's not how it works there are
[1:32:10] four different existences right the
[1:32:12] region of devil Spirits Fallen Angels
[1:32:16] who lost their first state and became
[1:32:19] spirits that seek to cause Discord in
[1:32:21] the realm of men that's right where are
[1:32:23] those exps are they under the ground sir
[1:32:26] sir they're working right here they're
[1:32:28] in your politicians they're in your
[1:32:30] government they're the definitely the
[1:32:33] politicians because everything that
[1:32:35] comes out of them is a
[1:32:37] lie and we know who the father of all
[1:32:39] lies is yes sir what is the meaning of
[1:32:42] devil liar false accuser the word demon
[1:32:48] is not even in the Bible the word demon
[1:32:51] comes from the Greek word Deon which
[1:32:54] means
[1:32:57] superhuman someone with Supernatural
[1:33:00] strength Supernatural ability that's
[1:33:03] where the word demon comes from so demon
[1:33:06] we just use it demon and devil but what
[1:33:08] is a devil really it's a lying
[1:33:10] spirit so whenever you see somebody
[1:33:13] possessed with the devil and you're
[1:33:15] afraid of someone who's ring on the FL
[1:33:17] like a snake speaking in a different
[1:33:19] voice uh saying I Know Who You Are going
[1:33:24] to come for you in your sleep that's a
[1:33:27] lie that's not a demon that's not a
[1:33:29] devil where are devils they're behind
[1:33:32] pulpits preaching the gospel the lying
[1:33:36] Spirits people possessed with Devils
[1:33:39] with lying Spirits occur in people like
[1:33:42] Psychopaths sociopaths are people who
[1:33:45] are who lie
[1:33:47] compulsively those are people you pass
[1:33:49] every day who like uh salesman who like
[1:33:53] to you that they're selling it to you
[1:33:55] for for a great price cost price they're
[1:33:59] selling you a lie why are they selling
[1:34:01] you lie because they want to taken
[1:34:02] advantage of you anything that is a lie
[1:34:06] is of The Fifth Dimension which is why
[1:34:09] children is always important to tell the
[1:34:11] truth because the truth shall set you
[1:34:15] free that's what a devil actually is
[1:34:19] it's a lie how do we know why do they
[1:34:21] say to Jesus thou art a devil
[1:34:25] nobody's doing this to you because there
[1:34:27] what they're actually saying is you're
[1:34:30] lying that's what they mean by a devil
[1:34:33] it's a lying spirit so when you have
[1:34:35] people there's a difference between
[1:34:37] afflicted by demons and possessed by
[1:34:39] demons it's easier to see someone
[1:34:42] afflicted by a demon because you can see
[1:34:44] the effects on the body there's
[1:34:46] depression there's a Darkness they want
[1:34:48] to talk they're aloof they're going off
[1:34:51] to substances
[1:34:53] afflicted by something they're afflicted
[1:34:55] by a lie and this that is simple it
[1:34:58] could be from they were molested as
[1:35:00] children they suffered uh the the tragic
[1:35:03] loss of something a mother who lost a
[1:35:05] child and went into absolute depression
[1:35:07] and is afflicted by a spirit of
[1:35:09] depression you read demonology brother
[1:35:12] maram says every disease is accompanied
[1:35:14] by a spirit a Son of God knows he's
[1:35:16] healed when the spirit disappears even
[1:35:19] if the disease is still
[1:35:21] there and that's why the this grow is
[1:35:24] here this lady says I'm Healed how does
[1:35:25] she know because the spirit is departed
[1:35:27] even though the growth is still there he
[1:35:29] says in demonology the disease is
[1:35:32] accompanied by a lying
[1:35:34] spirit amen but who are the real Devils
[1:35:38] that you don't know it's the colleague
[1:35:40] you work with the brother who's teaching
[1:35:42] you false Doctrine that's right the
[1:35:45] brother who's convincing you to believe
[1:35:47] a lie that's not Afflicted that's right
[1:35:51] that's possessed amen try casting that
[1:35:54] one out Antichrist
[1:35:57] amen see we want to cast out people who
[1:36:00] are afflicted we have depression those
[1:36:03] people need love
[1:36:05] amen love casteth
[1:36:09] out that's what they need they don't
[1:36:11] need demon possession
[1:36:13] services but try casting out the liar
[1:36:16] from a psychopath
[1:36:19] right from a
[1:36:21] sociopath from people who use the Bible
[1:36:24] to twist its words to manipulate people
[1:36:28] to give them money am try costing that
[1:36:31] out you can have a service with a
[1:36:33] thousand people they'll take over you
[1:36:35] right if you don't know what dimensions
[1:36:37] really are that's right the realm of
[1:36:40] Satan is the the depth of lies and
[1:36:43] deceit he's the father of all lies right
[1:36:46] so if you really want to know who Satan
[1:36:48] is and what that Dimension now now tell
[1:36:50] me where the dimension of Lies is in
[1:36:54] this world under the ground no it's
[1:36:57] right here it's connected to man there
[1:37:00] are humans in this world whose existence
[1:37:03] is by lies that's right brother bam when
[1:37:06] he when he was in a hospital bed and and
[1:37:10] he he he told us he died and he felt his
[1:37:13] Spirit just falling and falling and
[1:37:15] falling did he describe
[1:37:17] fire no what did he say about
[1:37:20] it this is important right uh he said it
[1:37:24] was like a
[1:37:25] nightmare that's all it was like a
[1:37:27] nightmare it's like have you ever had
[1:37:29] that feeling where everyone has that
[1:37:31] dream uh where you're just falling you
[1:37:34] might actually land on the floor of
[1:37:37] while you're sleeping but you have this
[1:37:40] horrible sensation of
[1:37:42] falling right some people tell me that
[1:37:44] that their recurring dream is losing
[1:37:46] their teeth in their mouth I've never
[1:37:47] had that one I don't know about that
[1:37:49] maybe that's bad I don't know uh don't
[1:37:52] want to figure that out but brother B
[1:37:55] speaks about it he says you like caught
[1:37:57] between two places and it's it's a
[1:38:00] horror he uses the word horror he
[1:38:02] doesn't talk about fire and demons
[1:38:05] chasing you and all of that no nobody
[1:38:08] you will not even find that in the Bible
[1:38:10] all right so anyway what happens is
[1:38:13] after Christ Paradise is emptied out you
[1:38:16] know this which means all those Saints
[1:38:19] which were in that side of the chasm get
[1:38:21] resurrected and taken where
[1:38:24] into the sixth
[1:38:26] Dimension right where they don't have
[1:38:28] the same existence they had before
[1:38:31] Christ their existence changed which
[1:38:34] means the dimension of Hell
[1:38:37] changed amen and so all you're left with
[1:38:40] is those last three Paradise was emptied
[1:38:43] out so let's look at not a burning hell
[1:38:46] under uh until the Lake of Fire
[1:38:48] Revelations 2014 when uh the sinner dies
[1:38:52] his soul is caught between between Earth
[1:38:54] and Hell in a nightmare that's brother
[1:38:56] Mam's words what that's what happens
[1:38:58] when a sinner dies the wrong
[1:39:00] understanding of Hell came into the
[1:39:02] church because of the Catholic church
[1:39:04] right who learned from the Hebrew
[1:39:08] mythology that they got from Babylon are
[1:39:10] you still awake all right before Christ
[1:39:14] don't sleep you might be caught in
[1:39:16] another
[1:39:18] dimension before Christ the Jews
[1:39:21] believed that death was a place of sleep
[1:39:24] for the soul which they called shol
[1:39:26] which means the word hell didn't even
[1:39:29] exist they called it the place of sleep
[1:39:32] for the soul shio some of them believe
[1:39:35] that everyone who dies goes to shio they
[1:39:37] didn't even know there was a Chasm
[1:39:39] brother brandham tells us there was a
[1:39:40] Chasm right and um it was never
[1:39:43] described as a place burning with fire
[1:39:46] never ever until the church picked it up
[1:39:49] as time progressed from Moses stories of
[1:39:52] uh from Moses stories of Hell began to
[1:39:55] increase until it became something
[1:39:57] hugely exaggerated and that's what we
[1:39:59] have today right the Greeks took it up
[1:40:03] the Greeks spoke about Hades we'll tell
[1:40:05] you about that now I want to I want to
[1:40:07] show you where it comes from right when
[1:40:11] the Lord Jesus spoke of hell if you go
[1:40:13] into the gospels and you see where he
[1:40:16] spoke about hell you'll see the word
[1:40:18] there is the Aramaic word
[1:40:20] gehna right gehenna not had is not hell
[1:40:25] gehenna so you study where this comes
[1:40:28] from and we read this Mark 9:44 says
[1:40:31] where their worm this is the Lord Jesus
[1:40:32] saying where their worm dieth not and
[1:40:35] the fire is not quenched so I was
[1:40:37] waiting for this because I know the
[1:40:39] people who know the scripture and say
[1:40:40] brother Al hold on a second Jesus said
[1:40:43] where the worm dieth not and the fire is
[1:40:46] not
[1:40:48] quenched you believe there's worms in
[1:40:51] hell in ex existence of demons and the
[1:40:55] fire is not quenched where does this
[1:40:57] come from let's expose the LIE right
[1:41:01] gehenna was originally the valley of
[1:41:05] hom which was outside the Gate of
[1:41:08] Jerusalem it was south of Jerusalem
[1:41:11] where the filth and dead animals were
[1:41:14] burned the fire was not
[1:41:17] quenched and the worm did not
[1:41:20] die because it was always burning with
[1:41:24] carcasses that would dying and Jesus was
[1:41:27] telling because the Believers or the the
[1:41:30] Jewish people would not burn or bury
[1:41:33] criminals and rapists and murderers in
[1:41:37] the burial grounds of the righteous so
[1:41:40] they took all criminals all unworthy
[1:41:43] people and threw them in this
[1:41:45] Pit Where did the Legend come from I can
[1:41:48] hear how quiet you are you hear this
[1:41:50] before right the wicked of the city were
[1:41:53] cast out and burned because this comes
[1:41:56] from way back right before the
[1:41:58] rebuilding of Jerusalem many children
[1:42:01] and young virgins were sacrificed to
[1:42:04] Heathen gods in the valley of
[1:42:06] Kon and this is spoken of in the Bible
[1:42:09] that's why the Jews believed this ground
[1:42:11] was cursed many of them came up with a
[1:42:14] legend of it so let's go to it Jeremiah
[1:42:19] 7:31 and they have built the high places
[1:42:21] of toet which is a god of those people
[1:42:26] which is in the Valley of the son of hom
[1:42:30] to burn their sons and daughters in the
[1:42:33] fire that's where they were sacrificing
[1:42:36] babies and virgin girls in the fire in
[1:42:40] the Valley of the son of Hino which I
[1:42:43] commanded them Jeremiah saying I
[1:42:44] commanded them not neither came it into
[1:42:47] my heart I don't believe in what they
[1:42:49] were doing right so after the rebuilding
[1:42:52] it became the rubbish dump the Refuge
[1:42:55] site of Jerusalem but people were
[1:42:57] terrified of it because it was always
[1:42:59] burning and that's where the Legend of
[1:43:01] Hell burning was
[1:43:04] born so when Jesus was speaking of them
[1:43:07] being cast into the place where the fire
[1:43:09] is not quenched the worm dieth not he's
[1:43:11] telling you if you don't live right and
[1:43:14] if you're going to be a transgressor
[1:43:15] that's going to be your
[1:43:17] end in the valley of Kino and what did
[1:43:20] the Christians do they started believing
[1:43:23] Jesus said how why would he say that why
[1:43:26] would the son of man who knows what hell
[1:43:28] is start a thing where there's fire and
[1:43:32] worms that do not
[1:43:36] die many moabites and Jews believe that
[1:43:39] the Valley of the of hom was the
[1:43:42] beginning of the pit a cursed place you
[1:43:45] can go and read it and it's there in the
[1:43:46] bible Jeremiah says it Jesus Christ Our
[1:43:49] Lord was referring to what Jeremiah
[1:43:52] spoke of he didn't so do you agree Jesus
[1:43:55] didn't make that up he was referring to
[1:43:58] Jeremiah's reference right when when
[1:44:02] Christ spoke about the worm that dieth
[1:44:04] not and the fire is not quenched he was
[1:44:06] speaking from where from Isaiah again he
[1:44:09] didn't make up the fire is not quenched
[1:44:11] and the worm dieth not here's Isaiah
[1:44:14] 6624 and they shall go and look upon the
[1:44:17] carcasses of men not the spirits of men
[1:44:20] in Hell the carcasses of men burning
[1:44:23] that have transgressed against me for
[1:44:26] their worm shall not die neither shall
[1:44:28] their fire be quenched and they shall be
[1:44:31] an abhorring unto all
[1:44:33] flesh this is where Jesus is quoting
[1:44:36] from where their worm die what is the
[1:44:38] worm the worm is a part that takes part
[1:44:41] in the composition the decomposition of
[1:44:43] human bodies and the fire is not
[1:44:45] quenched because they had to keep this
[1:44:47] pit burning all the time because it had
[1:44:50] to burn out these carcasses and some of
[1:44:52] these carcasses took death days until
[1:44:54] the disease was completely quenched they
[1:44:56] remember they had a big deal about
[1:44:58] diseased carcasses that's right right
[1:45:00] and they were not going to bury
[1:45:02] criminals in the in where the righteous
[1:45:05] are buried burial was a big thing to to
[1:45:08] the people remember Joseph said don't
[1:45:09] leave my bones in
[1:45:11] Egypt take me back to the the ground of
[1:45:14] Heth I want to be gathered to my people
[1:45:17] amen where the people were gathered and
[1:45:19] and Jacob died and pulled up his legs
[1:45:21] and was gathered to his people
[1:45:23] and this one died and was gathered to
[1:45:25] his people and that one died and was
[1:45:27] gathered to his people they were buried
[1:45:29] in the burial ground that was purchased
[1:45:31] by Abraham from the sons of Heth is that
[1:45:34] right that's what they mean gathered to
[1:45:35] their
[1:45:37] people so Isaiah 6 say I'm showing you
[1:45:40] where the Legends
[1:45:41] began why these Legends mythology
[1:45:45] Legends are actually nice things uh the
[1:45:48] the mythology of it and where the
[1:45:50] Christian church and the Catholic Church
[1:45:52] took it up without even looking at where
[1:45:55] it came
[1:45:56] from uh so some of you if you young
[1:45:59] people don't
[1:46:00] realize Jerusalem had no bin
[1:46:03] trucks they had no refuge dump they had
[1:46:07] no way to get rid of decomposing things
[1:46:09] they had a fish gate a sheep gate a dung
[1:46:12] gate this gate it it had a system for a
[1:46:16] city to get rid of Filth from the city
[1:46:19] and the valley of hom on the south was a
[1:46:22] part of the Refuge that had to be burned
[1:46:24] so that no contamination had to come
[1:46:26] into the City and that's what Christ was
[1:46:29] speaking about where the worm dieth not
[1:46:31] and the fire is not
[1:46:34] quenched Lord there is no literal fire
[1:46:37] which on on Earth fire is is of matter a
[1:46:41] type of matter called plasma it there's
[1:46:43] no literal fire in hell if you talk
[1:46:46] about fire um how was there Holy Fire
[1:46:50] where a bush was not burning when Moses
[1:46:52] saw it
[1:46:53] because it was not a fire of this
[1:46:55] Dimension the fire the the pillar of
[1:46:58] fire was not a fire of this Dimension
[1:47:01] right and so when he's speaking about
[1:47:03] fire what do we understand by the worm
[1:47:05] died not spiritually and the fire is not
[1:47:08] quenched so spiritually symbolically
[1:47:12] their worm dieth not the guilty
[1:47:14] conscience of a person is actually what
[1:47:17] the worm refers to when Jesus Christ is
[1:47:19] speaking of the spiritual aspect of it
[1:47:22] guilty conscience is that worm the fire
[1:47:24] is the spiritual
[1:47:26] torment right this the spirit being
[1:47:29] tormented by the life that you live if
[1:47:31] you die and you know you rejected God
[1:47:35] okay you rejected God you rejected his
[1:47:37] word on Earth you die you go into the
[1:47:39] existence of The Fifth Dimension there
[1:47:41] is a
[1:47:43] knowledge that you are not in a good
[1:47:45] place you are in the condition of being
[1:47:48] a spirit without a body you cannot
[1:47:52] express yourself you know you have
[1:47:54] rejected the truth you know you are in a
[1:47:57] place of unrest it's torment you know
[1:48:00] the wrong things you've done that's the
[1:48:03] torment personal fire burning in the
[1:48:06] Bible spiritual burning speaks of
[1:48:08] Torment of the
[1:48:10] spirit right have you ever heard it is
[1:48:12] better to marry than to
[1:48:15] burn burning in lust that is a torment
[1:48:19] of lust taken over you right burned with
[1:48:22] hunger
[1:48:23] marry them to burn you you you'll read
[1:48:26] all these things in the Bible they were
[1:48:28] they burned with
[1:48:29] Hunger brother man says get the Eastern
[1:48:31] View and the Bible becomes a new book
[1:48:33] When Your Eyes Open up and you
[1:48:35] understand what happened why there's
[1:48:37] this thing called the pit and the
[1:48:38] entrance of the pit it was the valley of
[1:48:41] Kino you love him
[1:48:43] Saints New Testament the Greeks came in
[1:48:47] the Romans came in they made this guy
[1:48:49] called Hades Hades isn't and that's
[1:48:52] where the English said that's hell but
[1:48:55] Hades was a mythological Greek god the
[1:49:00] god of the
[1:49:01] underworld the one who handled the the
[1:49:05] death he was respect and he was the
[1:49:07] brother of Zeus or somebody and the guy
[1:49:09] from the sea what is his
[1:49:11] name Poseidon yeah so and and and he was
[1:49:16] a brother of I don't even want to go
[1:49:18] into the story it's too complicated but
[1:49:20] when the English translated it they used
[1:49:22] used one word and it was
[1:49:26] hell but the prophet uses the separation
[1:49:30] correctly death hell and the
[1:49:34] grave right because of the Bible death
[1:49:37] hell and the grave separate things right
[1:49:41] hell is a dimension so the grave is not
[1:49:43] in
[1:49:45] existence where people you put their
[1:49:48] bodies in they they contaminate they
[1:49:51] decompose and that's the end of it it's
[1:49:53] not an existence death is not an
[1:49:56] existence hell is an existence where a
[1:50:00] spirit is existing without a body a
[1:50:03] spirit and a soul is existing without a
[1:50:05] body separation there is death hell and
[1:50:08] the grave all right so brother bam says
[1:50:11] in one place you might read this in the
[1:50:13] message very uh complicated sometimes
[1:50:16] Christ's body is in the grave his soul
[1:50:18] is in Hell preaching to the Lost
[1:50:23] right but there are people who believe
[1:50:25] the body goes into hell there's a quote
[1:50:28] brother said the body lay in the grave
[1:50:29] his soul went into hell to preach to the
[1:50:32] Lost there's a separation between grave
[1:50:35] and Hell amen glory to God so here's the
[1:50:40] truth about hell it's a dimension of
[1:50:42] man's existence after rejecting the
[1:50:45] truth are you still with me it used to
[1:50:48] be after death hell was usually a
[1:50:51] dimension of existence after death where
[1:50:53] the spirit went in right but now it is
[1:50:57] becoming one with those who have
[1:51:01] rejected the truth while they are living
[1:51:04] how do we know the pale horse rider
[1:51:07] comes in in the in the seventh Church
[1:51:09] age and death in Hell follows with him
[1:51:14] this actually telling you just before
[1:51:16] Heaven and Earth become one hell and
[1:51:19] Earth are becoming one under the Pale
[1:51:22] Horse wrer it's the perfect time for
[1:51:24] Heaven to come down glory to God so that
[1:51:27] Dimension that existence of uh um uh the
[1:51:32] dimension of demons or devil spirits and
[1:51:34] Satan is very much alive we know this
[1:51:37] because brother maram when he when he
[1:51:38] died he had that vision and then he saw
[1:51:40] those ladies coming up the
[1:51:42] escalator remember that and then it
[1:51:44] occurred to him hell is on
[1:51:48] Earth whoa it is now a dimension
[1:51:52] Saints Hallelujah open up your eyes yes
[1:51:56] sir there are people living right now in
[1:52:00] Hell sir you think all these things are
[1:52:04] a mistake it's happening around us I was
[1:52:08] sharing with the brothers you think all
[1:52:09] is transgender nonsense gender identity
[1:52:13] is a mistake no sir no
[1:52:17] why because it's going right against
[1:52:20] something God is bringing that's right
[1:52:22] amen do you not believe she is
[1:52:29] him hold on those are
[1:52:33] pronouns you just said she is him that's
[1:52:36] what they're saying it's happening right
[1:52:38] now when the open book the bright coming
[1:52:41] of Christ is taking place except the
[1:52:43] true feminine nature of God is not
[1:52:46] claiming to be the masculine she's not
[1:52:49] trying to overpower him she's not trying
[1:52:52] to turn physical appearance into a man
[1:52:54] she's very happy to be the feminine
[1:52:56] nature of God and accept the masculine
[1:52:59] who is coming down to become us amen
[1:53:02] Heaven and Earth becoming one but look
[1:53:05] what the devil is doing with the very
[1:53:06] thing you are
[1:53:07] claiming right now amongst young people
[1:53:11] this generation is heading there didn't
[1:53:13] don't think it's happening for no
[1:53:18] reason after death the existence of
[1:53:21] spirit and soul without a body that's
[1:53:23] what hell is Saints there are really
[1:53:27] depressed people out there in the world
[1:53:29] yes sir they are living in a
[1:53:33] Hell their Dimension is light matter

[1:53:41] things right now there are depressed
[1:53:43] people do you know how many people in
[1:53:45] this world today are in
[1:53:48] anti-depressants if you go I get it
[1:53:50] every year I make sure I find that I

[1:53:54] depression which age has more depression
[1:53:57] what the kids are going through I have a
[1:53:58] look at I track it I attract the
[1:54:00] depression I attract the divorce rates I

[1:54:08] high the depression rates are you know
[1:54:10] demonology what depression is it's
[1:54:13] Affliction of The Fifth Dimension that's
[1:54:15] right amen and it's happening all around
[1:54:18] us there are poor people out there being
[1:54:21] afflicted by the fth dimension and they
[1:54:23] need your
[1:54:24] help you're the only one that can
[1:54:27] release them from the grip of Lies this
[1:54:30] is why the truth must Prevail glory to
[1:54:33] God the sixth Dimension Heaven's realm
[1:54:36] of angels and the Blessed glorious it
[1:54:40] used to be the realm of
[1:54:42] angels right before Earth became man's
[1:54:45] home after Christ's Resurrection it
[1:54:48] became the realm of the Blessed when
[1:54:49] Paradise was emptied out the the those
[1:54:52] who died in God were taken up in there
[1:54:55] and received a new existence amen the
[1:54:58] sixth Dimension is now an extended
[1:55:02] existence of
[1:55:03] man right so the same way hell is
[1:55:07] connected to living people
[1:55:10] today do you know what it means to be
[1:55:13] seated in Heavenly
[1:55:15] places glory to God this is not some
[1:55:19] figment of our
[1:55:20] imagination we know all these things
[1:55:23] remember when brother boswood
[1:55:25] died did he have to fly into space to
[1:55:28] shake their
[1:55:29] hands brother M said he got up in the
[1:55:31] room started shaking the hands of the
[1:55:33] Blessed his light matter time was
[1:55:35] responding to another dimension because
[1:55:38] his spiritual eye was open up and he
[1:55:40] could see what was right around him
[1:55:42] glory to God that sixth Dimension is
[1:55:45] sitting right here with you the same way
[1:55:48] hell came in and is affecting people so
[1:55:51] God brought in heaven down upon us and
[1:55:55] we are seated those Saints you all
[1:55:57] they're waiting for is your eyes to be
[1:55:59] open to them you're not waiting for a
[1:56:01] time for them to
[1:56:02] come they're here you're seated in
[1:56:05] Heavenly places those prophets those
[1:56:08] sages those um uh living creatures those
[1:56:12] anointings that's all a dimension of
[1:56:14] Heaven they're affecting you they're
[1:56:16] influencing you glory to God all those
[1:56:20] who died in Christ are living in his
[1:56:22] Celestial body the sixth Dimension is an
[1:56:24] extended existence of man so those in
[1:56:26] this Dimension are not United with the
[1:56:29] seventh that's right this is the amazing
[1:56:32] thing I love this because brother M said
[1:56:35] when he went there he said where is
[1:56:37] Jesus now remember went there his Spirit
[1:56:41] was transported into that place I can't
[1:56:43] explain it I'll be honest I have no idea
[1:56:45] how that works right I can't explain it
[1:56:47] but he told us he saw it they were 18 to
[1:56:50] 21 it looked like an ex existence he
[1:56:52] spoke about
[1:56:55] Fields not
[1:56:58] space he spoke about he spoke about an
[1:57:01] existence he saw these people and he
[1:57:04] said where is Jesus and they said he's a
[1:57:06] little
[1:57:07] higher that's the seven not that there's
[1:57:10] a double story in heaven now right why
[1:57:13] and I love this why are they waiting for
[1:57:16] us that's right why can they not be
[1:57:19] perfected without us because day in
[1:57:23] their life and generation did not come
[1:57:25] to the marriage of the Lamb what is the
[1:57:28] marriage of the Lamb it is the combining
[1:57:31] of Earth matter time with number
[1:57:34] seven God himself is the marriage that's
[1:57:38] why to know the dimensions is so
[1:57:40] important they are waiting for us to
[1:57:43] combine with seven they join with us and
[1:57:46] that's why we complete the race for them
[1:57:49] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:57:52] they're waiting for us that's why the
[1:57:55] marriage is so important to them you're
[1:57:57] thinking you're waiting for
[1:58:00] them oh when I see the dead Saints they
[1:58:03] knock at my door we heard all the
[1:58:05] stories they knock at my door and then
[1:58:07] I'm going to I'm going to receive some
[1:58:09] Supernatural thing and then I'm going to
[1:58:11] go in the Rapture no sir they're waiting
[1:58:13] for you they're waiting for your eyes to
[1:58:15] open up to the marriage of the Lamb to
[1:58:18] see your husband standing before you to
[1:58:20] join with your Earthly existence
[1:58:22] and when that happens they become
[1:58:24] visible to you because now you've
[1:58:26] completed the race for them praise be to
[1:58:29] God it takes the bride to make the sixth
[1:58:32] and seventh Dimension One how do we know
[1:58:35] this happens when Christ came to Earth
[1:58:37] the veil rent in Twain and the two rooms
[1:58:41] became one this must merge seventh and
[1:58:45] six have to merge at some
[1:58:48] point but before that happens we have to
[1:58:51] marry
[1:58:52] the seventh
[1:58:54] Dimension oh
[1:58:55] Hallelujah this is not heaven
[1:59:00] am can you see that old man sitting on
[1:59:03] the throne that is not God I don't know
[1:59:05] who that is and then Christ standing
[1:59:08] there next to him interceding the
[1:59:10] Catholics were fantastic they were great
[1:59:13] storytellers apologies to all Catholics
[1:59:16] ex Catholics but you get taken for a
[1:59:19] very long
[1:59:20] ride you know because because uh for
[1:59:23] certain things you actually had to go to
[1:59:26] Mary because you were so bad you had to
[1:59:29] go to Mary who had to take it to Jesus
[1:59:31] who had to take it to the
[1:59:33] father and before you did that you had
[1:59:35] to pay the
[1:59:38] priest or else you'd go through
[1:59:40] purgatory and if per chance you had to
[1:59:42] go through Purgatory then you had to pay
[1:59:44] us to do the prayers for 9 days so that
[1:59:47] we make sure your soul passes through
[1:59:49] Purgatory peacefully
[1:59:52] all
[1:59:53] lies do you know where that comes from
[1:59:57] heathenism in my
[1:59:59] ancestors uh mythology when someone dies
[2:00:03] you have to do a 16-day prayer a 40-day
[2:00:06] prayer what is it about the soul finding
[2:00:10] rest those Catholics brought in their
[2:00:12] heathenism paganism into Christianity
[2:00:15] and the Christian Church got duped by
[2:00:17] it when Christ came he took away the
[2:00:20] fear of death in the grave and the
[2:00:23] church put it back into the
[2:00:26] people even the
[2:00:28] Pentecostals go preach the gospel man
[2:00:30] tell the truth I have no fear of death
[2:00:33] nor Hell nor demon Spirits because my
[2:00:37] savior gave us the victory Our Savior
[2:00:40] gave us the victory we fear no death no
[2:00:43] hell no pain because there is a hope
[2:00:45] beyond the grave for us glory to God
[2:00:48] it's not a funeral service that's a
[2:00:49] victory service
[2:00:52] amen so this is not heaven and this is
[2:00:56] definitely not how you get
[2:00:59] there this is a Pentecostal idea of the
[2:01:03] Rapture sadly I've heard message
[2:01:05] Believers tell me this is going to
[2:01:07] happen so I I asked some of them I said
[2:01:10] okay so Christ is going to come in a
[2:01:13] cloud uh how you going to see
[2:01:16] him is he going to be man's size because
[2:01:19] then he's going to be a dot in the cloud
[2:01:22] no one's going to see him and the first
[2:01:24] thing you know is CNN is going to
[2:01:26] broadcast it so it's not going to be a
[2:01:28] secret
[2:01:29] coming and then if all of us start
[2:01:31] floating like this then it's totally
[2:01:35] against everything the prophet says
[2:01:37] brother ROM says it'll be a secret they
[2:01:38] won't even know you're missing they
[2:01:39] won't even care cuz they never liked you
[2:01:41] anyway he said you won't even appear on
[2:01:44] a milk
[2:01:45] carton that's
[2:01:47] sad but right but there W and he said of
[2:01:50] course there's so few that will go in
[2:01:53] the translation they'll not even miss
[2:01:55] you'll be a total secret the second
[2:01:58] coming to the Bride is a total secret
[2:02:01] but this is what they're waiting for I
[2:02:04] have such precious Pentecostal friends
[2:02:07] who preach this till tears comes out
[2:02:10] comes out of their eyes they get so
[2:02:12] anointed by preaching this they fall on
[2:02:14] the floor they're friends of mine school
[2:02:16] friends while preaching the word and I
[2:02:19] love them and I try to change what but
[2:02:22] they're so indoctrinated by this they
[2:02:24] believe they're going to float in the
[2:02:25] sky
[2:02:26] someday how can we who have the truth in
[2:02:29] the open book succumb to
[2:02:32] this if you don't get Dimensions you'll
[2:02:35] never understand the
[2:02:36] translation how do we know Christ's
[2:02:39] mystery Christ is revealed in his own
[2:02:41] word brother BR says and they're going
[2:02:43] to find out someday you know this
[2:02:45] already right yes they're not seeing 150
[2:02:47] million of light space either they're
[2:02:50] going right around in a Circle that's
[2:02:52] exactly you're going to find it one of
[2:02:54] these days that when you go to heaven
[2:02:56] you don't fly off somewhere else right
[2:02:59] somebody say Amen that picture is
[2:03:02] definitely false you're still right here
[2:03:07] too just in another dimension faster
[2:03:10] than this one that's what I believe when
[2:03:13] I think of the translation that's what I
[2:03:16] believe when Elijah went in the
[2:03:17] translation it wasn't flying off to
[2:03:19] space it was here in a dimension when it
[2:03:22] says they looked up what does it mean up
[2:03:25] you think is up up means a higher
[2:03:28] Dimension and they saw him ascending a
[2:03:31] cloud Acts 1:8 and those two angels were
[2:03:33] there why do you stare the same way he
[2:03:35] went is the same way he'll come so
[2:03:37] brother Al you wrong he went up in the
[2:03:39] skies does it say that it said they
[2:03:42] looked up steadfastly do you know what
[2:03:45] that means we didn't if we didn't even
[2:03:47] know what the valy of h
[2:03:50] means you just assume you have the
[2:03:52] authority and what looking steadfastly
[2:03:54] up
[2:03:55] is get the dimensions then you'll know
[2:03:58] what it means amen it's a higher
[2:03:59] Dimension certainly to be able to look
[2:04:02] up is to look up to God when it says
[2:04:05] lift up your heads or your Gates what
[2:04:07] does up me let the king of glory come in
[2:04:11] look up for your Redemption draws nigh I
[2:04:13] don't see the bride walking like this
[2:04:17] everywhere look up means get a higher
[2:04:20] Vision glory to to God get a higher
[2:04:23] understanding above the things that
[2:04:25] they're preaching here in this Earthly
[2:04:27] realm because look up look into a higher
[2:04:30] dimension for your Redemption draws nigh
[2:04:33] that doesn't mean look with your nose in
[2:04:34] the clouds glory to
[2:04:37] God Seven Dimension before there was
[2:04:40] anything there was
[2:04:43] God this is beautiful he was the first
[2:04:47] existence nothing existed he was the
[2:04:50] self existing one yes sir he was the
[2:04:55] first yes sir but we defined him now as
[2:04:57] the seventh because it's the hardest to
[2:05:01] attain yes you are going to attain the
[2:05:04] existence of God yes that's what
[2:05:07] restoration is
[2:05:09] about we'll show you tomorrow when he
[2:05:12] became the logos a new form of existence
[2:05:15] began because the seventh Dimension made
[2:05:18] himself visible in the sixth Dimension
[2:05:20] so the Ang angs could see him he was the
[2:05:23] seventh making himself visible in the
[2:05:26] sixth When sin came in the sixth
[2:05:28] Dimension was separated a veil came in
[2:05:31] the way between seven and six heaven was
[2:05:34] only called heaven to differentiate from
[2:05:37] Earth the heavens speak of the universe
[2:05:40] the heavens speak of the atmosphere of
[2:05:42] Earth then there's the heaven of Heavens
[2:05:45] in the Bible Heaven refers to having
[2:05:49] rule over
[2:05:50] Earth right Heaven is his throne Earth
[2:05:53] Is His foottoo it's an existence it's a
[2:05:55] dimension he used the understanding of
[2:05:58] the universe to express his existence
[2:06:00] beyond Earth's existence he's outside of
[2:06:03] light matter time Heaven is an English
[2:06:06] word which we use to differentiate what
[2:06:08] the seventh Dimension is in fact it is
[2:06:11] simply the realm of
[2:06:14] Eternity Eternal existence God is
[2:06:18] eternity eternal life is God amen amen
[2:06:23] not that old guy with a
[2:06:26] beard who has to say bring me the
[2:06:29] Scrolls I need to remember who
[2:06:32] sinned open the books cuz I forgot what
[2:06:35] their Works
[2:06:38] were that's not the seven that's not an
[2:06:41] eternal God there's no time there's no
[2:06:44] forgetting when he said and God when and
[2:06:47] said and God remembered Noah does that
[2:06:49] mean he forgot him no the word
[2:06:52] Remembered in the Bible means keeping
[2:06:54] his
[2:06:57] promise see how our English lets us down
[2:07:00] it's
[2:07:02] terrible in you know what when God said
[2:07:05] let there be light did he say that in
[2:07:09] English cuz we all say that and God said
[2:07:12] let there be light when English was
[2:07:15] informed even Hebrew was informed so how
[2:07:19] did he say it
[2:07:22] when God speaks it's when his thoughts
[2:07:24] become
[2:07:27] manifested he didn't need to use Earthly
[2:07:30] languages this pathetic languages barely
[2:07:32] explains anything and we have to you
[2:07:35] know I was speaking on that I was
[2:07:36] telling brother Chad and them I did this
[2:07:38] exercise in our church when I was trying
[2:07:40] to explain how powerful the seven seal
[2:07:43] is and I was talking about how we we
[2:07:45] struggle with languages and we fight
[2:07:47] about quotes and this meaning it's so
[2:07:50] tedious yeah tiring exhausting and every
[2:07:53] other adjective that goes with it right
[2:07:56] and we fight with what quotes do you
[2:07:58] have how many quotes you mine is more
[2:08:00] proof because I have more
[2:08:04] quotes So I I I I I told a sister in our
[2:08:08] church who had parents who were
[2:08:11] mute to translate what I was saying in
[2:08:14] English using sign language there are
[2:08:17] people who catch the seven seal without
[2:08:19] knowing English
[2:08:22] how do you how do you do that how do
[2:08:24] they get the revelation of the coming of
[2:08:25] the Lord with sign language prise God
[2:08:28] which means the word transcends beyond
[2:08:31] our pathetic
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:34] languages it proves it's not about
[2:08:37] intellect the word is a person being
[2:08:40] made
[2:08:42] known we only use this language to
[2:08:45] understand some things right glory to
[2:08:47] God you don't have to be a a science Wiz
[2:08:50] you don't have to be someone who studied
[2:08:52] the Seven Hills and put this quote in
[2:08:54] order and the dates in order and this
[2:08:55] and that you can be catching it even if
[2:08:57] you didn't know the quotes by the
[2:08:59] preaching of the word you're getting it
[2:09:01] and you know how you know you get it
[2:09:03] when someone says something that's false
[2:09:05] you say that's not true how do you know
[2:09:07] do you have the quotes I don't care I
[2:09:08] just know it's not
[2:09:10] true glory to God Amen in fact it's
[2:09:14] simply the existence of Eternal
[2:09:17] existence the realm of Eternal existence
[2:09:19] if anything has eternal life it is
[2:09:20] heaven
[2:09:22] is eternal life setting in sir that's a
[2:09:26] sign Heaven is here the Bible calls it
[2:09:29] the heaven of Heavens so heaven was
[2:09:31] extended how do we know brother Brandon
[2:09:33] says God stretched his tent prise he
[2:09:38] became man man formed on Earth Heaven
[2:09:40] the realm of eternal life was extended
[2:09:42] to Earth Adam in the beginning was a
[2:09:45] theophany combined with an Earthly body
[2:09:48] Heaven and Earth were once one in the
[2:09:50] garden of EG
[2:09:52] we'll show you that tomorrow he was not
[2:09:54] even subject to
[2:09:56] Angels that's right why was he not
[2:09:58] subject to Angels because he's one with
[2:10:01] seven angels were subject to
[2:10:04] him oh prise when he sned he lost
[2:10:09] heaven when Christ but that's why the
[2:10:12] tree of life was blocked he lost Heaven
[2:10:14] never to be
[2:10:15] attained unless Christ came in who was
[2:10:18] the second Adam who was Heaven and Earth
[2:10:21] and embraced God and man met and joined
[2:10:24] and he came to bring many Brethren like
[2:10:28] unto
[2:10:30] him what does that mean oh you know he's
[2:10:33] a guy who's holy he prays every day is
[2:10:36] that really God's holiness no be perfect
[2:10:40] as God in heaven is perfect how is God's
[2:10:43] perfection in heaven young people is it
[2:10:46] how short he cuts his hair is it that he
[2:10:49] doesn't wear
[2:10:50] shorts is that he doesn't listen to pop
[2:10:52] music what is the Holiness of God the
[2:10:55] singleness of his nature that's right
[2:10:57] the purity of his nature is Holiness
[2:11:00] holy means to be set apart set apart
[2:11:04] from what he only has one purpose amen
[2:11:07] what does it mean when you are not set
[2:11:09] apart when you're living your life for
[2:11:10] two purposes that's right the will of
[2:11:13] God and the will of man and you're
[2:11:14] trying to make it work together you try
[2:11:18] to make the message convenient for an
[2:11:19] Earthly purpose that's Unholy
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:22] that's not set apart if I live my life
[2:11:25] for God's purpose it means I'm holy yes
[2:11:29] sir Lord glory to God let's close it
[2:11:32] down seventh Dimension Heaven brother
[2:11:35] bam says in the for seal Heaven is
[2:11:37] consisted of the
[2:11:39] word that's not the sixth that's the
[2:11:42] seventh wherever the pure unadulterated
[2:11:46] person of the word
[2:11:47] is it is heaven the realm of eternal
[2:11:50] life when a man believes and accepts
[2:11:53] that the word person in that word person
[2:11:56] into himself it is the dimension of
[2:11:58] Heaven opening glory to God the purpose
[2:12:02] of the message and the open book
[2:12:04] returning to man is to bring Heaven and
[2:12:06] Earth back into a perfect union that's
[2:12:09] what we talk about when we speak about
[2:12:11] the open book and having the open book
[2:12:13] because that's what Revelation tells 10
[2:12:16] tells us it's Heaven coming down it's
[2:12:18] the book coming to man the book was in
[2:12:21] heaven whoever held the book
[2:12:25] ruled all
[2:12:28] Dimensions whoever held the
[2:12:30] book ruled all
[2:12:34] dimensions and where's the book
[2:12:37] Revelations 10 tells you it's given to
[2:12:40] man it comes back why because man lost
[2:12:44] the original title de to everything he
[2:12:46] inherited and the whole purpose of the
[2:12:49] first coming was to teach people what
[2:12:52] heaven and earth embraced is to bring
[2:12:54] the nature back to mankind to receive
[2:12:57] the book after seven Church ages so
[2:12:59] bride has been prepared and The book
[2:13:01] must come down Heaven and Earth

[2:16:54] that's what's happening with meise I'm
[2:16:56] in two Dimensions at one time I'm
[2:16:57] standing and looking at you but there's
[2:16:59] something else there in the message
[2:17:01] glorified Jesus he spoke about what's
[2:17:03] happening in the world he says can you
[2:17:04] see the darkness that's happening in the
[2:17:06] world the smuttiness the filth can you
[2:17:09] see all that he said they are influenced
[2:17:11] from a lower Dimension he said and those
[2:17:14] who are light amen are influenced by a
[2:17:18] higher Dimension God in the L he said to
[2:17:22] the people he said maybe you are in

[2:18:12] can we appreciate Heaven and Earth

[2:18:16] Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation
[2:18:19] of the fullness of time
[2:18:21] he will make all things in heaven and
[2:18:24] things in Earth one which is in
