the mystical union that is between christ and his church it is commended in the scripture to be honorable among all and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently discreetly advisedly soberly and in the fear of god into this holy estate these two persons come now to be joined we have gathered as family and friends of this man and this woman to lend our support and good will to this holy union who now gives this woman to be married to this man uh you may be seated black lamb will you take emily preston to be your wedded wife to live together after god's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony will you love her comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health forsaking all others keep yourself only under her so long as you both shall live thank you emily preston will you take blake lamb to be your wedded husband to live together after god's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony will you love him comfort him honor and obey him in sickness and in health forsaking all others keep yourself only unto him so long as you both shall live and let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over this ceremony lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege to be here today lord as we've come lord because you have drawn blake and emily together you had this in your mind before the foundation of the world and lord we've come down to time and in this element of time lord these two have grown up and they've come to the place where you have ordained that the two shall name now be won i pray that you bless this ceremony bless all that we say and do may we bring glory and honor to your name and to your plan in jesus christ's name we pray amen well this is a different wedding for me i've been officiant at several weddings i've participated in several weddings but this is the first time i've wedded my son to his bride and uh it's a different experience for us i've always looked at the family and said what's the big deal you just walk up it's easy but now i know what the big deal is and so blake and emily had desired that i would do the ceremony and perform the service and it's an honor for me to do so but but it's uh i was thinking and reflecting on what do you say this is your first born son none his bride and god is ordained and when you think about it you think of what a wonderful exciting time this is exciting for the families exciting for friends exciting for the local assembly because as a local church we've seen both of these individuals grow up in the church come to maturity and make choices for the lord and make sacrifices for christ and seeing god unite the two together and now we've come to this ceremony which is a tremendous time of celebration and rejoicing for what god has done and when you reflect on that you you can't help but reflect on the great purpose and plan of god because this is not the only rejoicing that's going on because the bride is uniting with the bridegroom and it's also a rejoicing time it's an exciting time if we look in the scriptures you can see that the bible starts with marriage and ends with marriage in the book of genesis god creates all things and he speaks his word and his word goes to work and forms and fashions the earth to the way he had it in his mind the way he wants it to look and god is working a plan over the days of creation and he's getting everything just so just the way he wants just the way he desired it in his heart but you can see he's building he's building from day one to day two to day three it's a building it's a progressing in god's mind his image is coming more into the reality and becoming clearer and clearer what he wants but but he's not finished until he has a man in the garden of eden and as he has this man in the garden of eden it looks like his work may be done that he saved the best for last but but there's a scripture that says it isn't god looked and said it is not good that man should dwell alone so you could see that god wasn't finished yet with his great creation and he couldn't be finished until he lays adam down and he strikes a blow to a rib under his side and he pulls out what we'll need to make the elements that will be needed to make his bride he takes that bride and he unites them back together in what is the crowning act and crowning achievement of all of creation and then after god has finished making everything he looked at all that he made and all that he had done and he said it is very good and it says and on the seventh day god rested god would not have rested if there was still more work to do god would not have rested if he had not completed the picture he was trying to paint the great masterpiece that he was trying to his mind that he had tried to portray he had finally got it so he could rest from his work because he had finished and what was that great masterpiece a man in his bride in a perfect setting and god could rest and we know that that image was destroyed by satan he came down and through deception he caused doubt on the word and a fall and since then god has been working to build the masterpiece again but if you look in revelation 19 verse 6 it says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints what was causing all heaven to rejoice what was the thunderings and the shoutings and the alleluias because the great god omnipotent raiden in his bride has made herself ready the marriage of the lamb had come and what had been destroyed in the garden of eden god had now restored his great masterpiece his great plan and we know that you know we come to the end of the book and the end of the story we see this great climax coming the marriage of the lamb is coming and it just happens to be that blake's last name is lamb and here we have a perfect picture the marriage of not the lamb but a lamb and his bride and so we can rejoice and we can shout hallelujah and glory to god for what god's done on earth but this is only a reflection of his great desire of what god's been trying to do all along so when we come to a wedding like this it's more than just what we see because what we see represents what we don't see what we don't see in the spiritual is happening all around us his bride has made herself ready and uniting with her bridegroom gone after he had created his great masterpiece and went to his rest lucifer shows up and through the serpent he it says in genesis 3 13 it says in the lord god said unto the woman what has this house done something happened something was now broken in god's great masterpiece something was wrong and he came to discover what was wrong and he asked her what was done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat the word begow means deceived he deceived me tricked me i fell into a trap i was deceived and now i did i broke the word i was deceived by the serpent and i broke the word and the breaking the commandment of god broke the perfect image of god and now the man and his wife were cast out of eden and looked like it was ruined but god's plan can never be defeated by satan god had a master plan and what he had done in the beginning and the creation only was foretelling what he really wanted to do because god was not after just one man and one woman but he was after christ and christ's bride which is a mini-membered bride the saints have gone the woman was deceived the first timothy 2 tells us that adam was not deceived he said an adam was not the seed but the woman being deceived was in the transgression adam was not deceived he knew what was right and what was wrong the woman was deceived but adam was not deceived and adam willfully chose to walk out with his wife to save her so that she wouldn't be lost foreshadowing a christ jesus christ would come and willingly take on our sin upon himself and suffer our reproaches suffer our sin and die on calvary to save us christ was never defeated that christ was never deceived but his bride had been deceived because after the first image fell god now begins to work and he makes a promise of a restoration and he begins to restore back and in that restoration he chooses a man named abraham he's going to choose abraham's seed to be a peculiar people and now we know the exodus story he sends moses down to draw that special people out of bondage out of egypt and bring them into the wilderness so that he can unite with them so that he can marry them he's going to have a people peculiar to himself and he chooses the nation of israel the children of abraham but if we read the story the same thing happens once again the nation of israel is deceived on the word they begin to mix religion together with the law of moses and the word of god and they get it all corrupt and they fall until god and the book of isaiah in the book of jeremiah sends prophets to call them an adulterous woman he says i brought you to marry you in the wilderness but yet you didn't keep my word so once again it looks like it failed then christ comes and the bible calls him the last adam in first corinthians 15 45 it says and so does it written the first adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit so god had restored an atom and this adam had not fallen but this adam had taken our fall and he had paid the price so that we could be free and now if there's a last adam must there be a last eve if god had restored adam will he restore his wife we see this is very planned and that's what the apostle paul talks about for in second corinthians 11 the apostle paul says for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband and that i may present you a chaste virgin to christ so paul says i have engaged you espoused you to one husband that i might present you a chaste virgin to christ what's paul doing he's trying to bring back this image adam had been restored and paid the price and made a way back now adam must have a wife there must be an eve and he says and paul says i have engaged you to christ but i'm worried about something he said i he said i'm jealous i have espoused you to one husband and then i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begot eve through his septility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ paul the apostle paul was afraid that this new gentile church would go the way of eve would go the way of israel he said i'm jealous over you i'm afraid that you'll be beguiled as he was beguiled we find out that's what happened now what happened to israel now happened to the church they began to be deceived by ideas of man by corrupt doctrines that came in now it looks like all would be lost but praise god there's a promise in revelation 19. the bride has made herself ready the marriage of the lamb has come and if it's written in the word it will happen satan will not have victory he will not stop god's plan for god is determined to have a bride for his son christ he's determined to restore what had been fallen all the way back in eden as a foreshadow of something greater in our day and he restored it through the last adam and now he's restoring the last eve if we read revelations three speaking of the laodicean church the last church the final church the seventh church and the first part of the book of revelation it says because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent when you come to the last church the final one we find that she says i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but god says that you are miserable wretched miserable poor blind and naked here you have that bride and just as paul was worried that she would be deceived and fall she fell but god had a plan he says i counsel to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent god said come to me come to me don't go anywhere else don't listen to any other voice come to me and buy of me gold white raiment and i salve and god in this day has provided gold and white raiment and i says he says in ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish god has already made the preparation god has already known what would happen to the church ages and god has said that he will cleanse he will sanctify and cleanse his church with the washing of water by the word and so what was it that he fell by the word what was it that israel fell by the word what was it that the early church fell by the word but what is it that's going to cleanse this bride the word the word will restore all that was lost the word will wash away all the corruption from man-made religion and man's ideas and schools of theology the word will wash it away the word will be restored lost through the dark ages but out of the dark ages they started printing bibles bibles were kept from the people now the bible come back into the hand of god's people and god began to restore the word one revelation by one revelation until they could see clearer and clearer and clear all that was lost until they finally in this day god through a prophetic ministry could bring us back to the full understanding of the full bible so that there can be a purifying water to wash this bride and clothe her with a white garment unspotted by man unspotted by deception or reasonings of man but washed lily white purified prepared for the wedding day i want to finish by reading the first verse we read revelations 19 6-8 and i heard it i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints emily didn't just walk up here haphazardly she didn't decide this morning what she would wear she didn't just wake up late forget to set the alarm run and put anything on she had in the closet and run up here to marry but she's been preparing for this for a long time she's been careful of her wedding dress she's been careful to keep it to watch over not to let it get spotted or stained or corrupted in any way to make sure that she was prepared that she prepared herself and the scripture says the bride had prepared herself jesus said when he left i go to prepare a place for you that i can come again you can be where i am and blake has been preparing a place literally painting and hammering and nailing and patching drywall he's been playing preparing a place but as he's been preparing his place doing his part emily's been doing her part in preparing herself preparing to leave the known the all the known and the familiar to move into the unfamiliar to leave family to be united with her bridegroom and then preparing herself for this day the right the right attire her hair everything she's thought about she's prepared for she's been careful over and i want to say the marriage of the lamb is come this is the day that the white raiment has been given for us to put on which is the word of god the bride has made herself ready she's careful she doesn't just take any word and put it on but she has to take the pure word of god unaltered by man and unchanged and undoctored by reasoning she has to take the word and she's careful about it and she's got to put it on and to put on the word means to live it she takes it and becomes a written epistle blake's been busy emily's been busy but i say christ has been busy and his bride has been careful to make sure she stays under the washing of the water of the word and make sure that everything she puts on is the white garment that's prepared for her this is what thrills our souls what we're looking at now with great excitement in a day when the world is in chaos when there's pandemics and political unrest and social unrest we're excited we're happy we're joyful for these two are becoming one and as just as we're happy and excited in the natural in the spiritual realm the same thing's happening christ is uniting with his bride she's made herself ready and in the midst of chaos and turmoil and trouble in india every hand there's a people on earth that is excited with great anticipation because they've united with their bridegroom they've been prepared by the word and they've taken the word on themselves and they know where they are and they know what's happening and they know that the next step is a glorious grand great step the next step for you guys is glorious and grand the next step
