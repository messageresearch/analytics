[22:32] 19-21
[22:34] psalm 107 19-21
[22:38] we seems like the last few times we
[22:41] always have trouble getting here
[22:44] uh this time we made it by the grace of
[22:46] god
[22:48] and but our luggage came on monday
[22:52] and that's that's kind of fine for the
[22:54] guys because you know you wear your
[22:56] socks three or four days then then it's
[22:58] like a challenge
[23:00] how many days can i go
[23:02] but for the sisters that's a different
[23:05] different story so
[23:07] praise the lord jesus
[23:09] god's merciful amen
[23:12] psalm 107 19-21
[23:16] then they cried unto the lord in their
[23:18] trouble
[23:19] and he saveth them out of their
[23:21] distresses
[23:23] he sent his word
[23:25] and healed them
[23:27] and delivered them from all their
[23:28] destructions
[23:30] oh that men would praise the lord for
[23:32] the for his goodness
[23:34] and for his wonderful works to the
[23:36] children of men
[23:38] and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of
[23:40] thanksgiving
[23:42] and declare his works with rejoicing
[23:45] praise the lord let's read in another
[23:47] place
[23:49] 2 thessalonians
[23:52] 2 1-4
[23:55] familiar verse
[23:58] chapter and verses 2 thessalonians 2 1-4
[24:13] now we beseech you brethren by the
[24:15] coming of our lord jesus christ and by
[24:17] our gathering together unto him
[24:19] that ye be not soon shaken in mind
[24:22] or be troubled
[24:24] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[24:27] letter as from us
[24:29] as that day
[24:32] as that the day of the of christ is at
[24:34] hand
[24:36] let no man deceive you by any means
[24:39] for that day
[24:41] shall not come except there come a great
[24:43] falling away first and that man of sin
[24:46] be revealed the son of perdition
[24:48] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[24:51] all that is called god
[24:53] or that is worshipped so that he is god
[24:56] sitteth in the temple of god showing
[24:58] himself
[24:59] that he is god
[25:02] lord we
[25:04] know that
[25:05] you are a god who's full of grace and
[25:07] mercy
[25:08] and you're a god of the word lord
[25:11] and god you don't honor us you honor the
[25:13] word in our life lord and so i'm so
[25:16] thankful for that lord and so we ask you
[25:18] to have your own way open your word to
[25:21] us lord may the holy spirit
[25:25] escort the word into our heart and god
[25:28] if anyone is listening tonight who's a
[25:30] sinner
[25:31] god whether here or on the
[25:34] the internet may the holy spirit come
[25:36] down in conviction and may they repent
[25:38] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[25:41] jesus christ
[25:42] and god they will receive the holy
[25:44] spirit we thank you so much lord in the
[25:47] name of jesus christ amen praise the
[25:49] lord you may be seated
[25:53] hallelujah so
[25:55] tonight this is
[25:57] my title is god is in his word and
[25:59] you're saying well of course
[26:01] of course he is
[26:03] all right let's see
[26:05] after i'm done if you can say that
[26:08] right hallelujah
[26:10] and i love that scripture in 107 psalms
[26:13] 107
[26:14] they cried unto the lord and he saveth
[26:16] them out of their distresses
[26:19] he sent his word and healed them and
[26:20] delivered them
[26:22] from their destructions and what an
[26:24] appropriate
[26:25] uh scripture it is even today still also
[26:29] in um
[26:30] i just forgot what book it was in but
[26:33] you know there's several be still and
[26:35] know that i'm god
[26:37] and no weapon formed against us shall
[26:39] prosper
[26:40] and and see those those are for
[26:42] believers no matter where they're at
[26:45] and and because
[26:47] every weapon that is formed against you
[26:49] is formed against christ
[26:51] and and as we have christ on the inside
[26:53] then we can never be defeated even in
[26:56] death we can't be defeated praise the
[26:57] lord
[26:58] and so it becomes a life of just
[27:02] constant joy and victory and overcoming
[27:05] i i just see that more and more
[27:08] it's it's like this wave of overcoming a
[27:12] word coming daily it governs every
[27:15] little thing hallelujah and so it's a
[27:18] wonderful time to be alive
[27:21] and so it's up to us to encourage others
[27:24] our children those around us not to
[27:26] focus on all the things that go on but
[27:28] to focus on that it's a wonderful time
[27:30] to be alive because we get to see the
[27:33] culmination of all things we get to see
[27:35] our life be victorious over satan amen
[27:40] hallelujah and so i love that i love
[27:42] being a christian and i love being a
[27:44] part of god because he who began a good
[27:46] work in me he who began a good work in
[27:49] you will be faithful to complete it you
[27:51] can all you're only maturing
[27:54] hallelujah which means you'll be the
[27:57] best forgiver
[28:00] someone cuts you off or does something
[28:02] to you
[28:03] you you say poor little fellers amen uh
[28:07] you know someone else from another
[28:08] church might dig you a little bit you'll
[28:10] say poor little fellas amen lord god
[28:12] just do something amen hallelujah and so
[28:16] that's what i'm talking about that's the
[28:17] holy spirit
[28:19] uh because that's more than just a nice
[28:21] person see god's not coming back for
[28:23] nice people he's coming back for
[28:25] believers
[28:26] amen and he's coming back for those that
[28:29] love god with all their heart amen
[28:31] oh hallelujah
[28:33] and so in our scriptures it said that
[28:35] the falling away there'll be a great
[28:37] falling away
[28:39] and so what are they falling away from
[28:43] and so even around message ranks people
[28:46] are falling away from the word
[28:49] still good people wonderful people but
[28:52] people the devil is distracting
[28:55] those to fall away from the word you're
[28:58] saying but but they have the word yes
[29:00] but have they even received it at the
[29:02] soul amen and so it causes people to
[29:05] when things get a little tough they kind
[29:07] of back up away from it amen and so
[29:10] people today are falling away from the
[29:13] word
[29:14] and its inherent nature
[29:17] and its power
[29:20] and its abilities
[29:22] because all of those things must be
[29:24] placed inside of you and i and they just
[29:27] don't automatically get there amen we
[29:29] repent we're baptized and then god
[29:32] promises to give us the holy spirit you
[29:34] know what if you are desperate how many
[29:37] came out of the world desperate yeah
[29:41] and i tell you what you didn't have to
[29:43] wonder when god did something for you
[29:45] right
[29:46] amen because you repented and you were
[29:49] baptized and god gave you the holy
[29:51] spirit and from that day you just
[29:53] started growing
[29:54] and it wasn't you you weren't adding
[29:56] miracle grow to your bathtub amen
[29:59] but you were you were all of a sudden
[30:01] there was something different and he
[30:03] just he's growing and growing and moving
[30:06] and moving and moving amen hallelujah
[30:09] and that's the word
[30:11] the word does that
[30:13] praise the lord
[30:14] but see it's they're not falling away
[30:16] from their concept of jesus christ in
[30:19] the word they're falling away from the
[30:22] word
[30:23] amen see we're in the final age and
[30:26] because of that
[30:28] there's spiritual darkness
[30:31] if you haven't noticed
[30:33] but there's also great light
[30:36] and both of them show up at the same
[30:38] time like judas and jesus
[30:41] right
[30:42] and so that antichrist spirit is here
[30:44] with the bride of jesus christ
[30:47] and so that antichrist spirit brother
[30:49] brahms said is here to
[30:51] weaken the church
[30:53] not just out and out blatantly do stuff
[30:56] but just just a little here
[30:59] just a little here
[31:01] and all of a sudden you know you like
[31:04] eating twinkies you get a real rush of
[31:06] sugar but afterwards you're kind of
[31:08] tired amen see there's no nutrition in
[31:10] that
[31:11] amen and so that's what's happening
[31:14] today is that that that people are are
[31:17] not sure anymore and so they're feeding
[31:20] the the people what they think is right
[31:22] without knowing what is right
[31:25] and the word is always right
[31:28] i don't care who you are though i'm
[31:29] gonna stay with the word no matter what
[31:32] oh
[31:33] someone was trying to sell me on a
[31:35] ministry one time and i said i'm sorry
[31:39] this third this this one little
[31:42] scripture here
[31:44] i can't get past that oh it infuriated
[31:47] them but what about all these
[31:50] great things and great teachings they're
[31:52] like i'm sorry
[31:54] husband of one wife that's it
[31:58] amen
[31:59] praise the lord
[32:01] amen
[32:02] hallelujah but see
[32:05] so people
[32:10] they're falling away
[32:11] from strength
[32:14] see the word gives you strength
[32:17] it lights your path it shows you what to
[32:19] do
[32:21] amen that's why again that's why those
[32:23] worldly things don't don't
[32:26] don't keep us like they did before
[32:30] we're always tempted to do things we're
[32:32] always tempted to to speed or to to do
[32:35] this little that amen but see
[32:37] but now you're just
[32:39] you're like oh god i'm sorry you know
[32:41] you get to talking and worship and all
[32:42] of a sudden whoa
[32:44] back down see that's a sin of omission
[32:47] but but what i'm i just use that as a
[32:49] little example because there's many more
[32:50] things
[32:51] uh
[32:52] like paying your tithes and your
[32:54] offerings
[32:55] amen i hope everybody gives heavy on
[32:57] offerings
[33:02] it's something there
[33:05] tithe is your obligation where you're
[33:07] blessed is an offering
[33:09] that offering doesn't usually go it
[33:11] doesn't go to the minister so don't
[33:12] think that it goes to pay these bills
[33:16] this is electricity
[33:18] this is heat
[33:20] or air conditioning
[33:22] that's why when you go to service you
[33:24] come ready to give because that's where
[33:26] god promises to give you 30 60 or 100
[33:29] fold amen amen
[33:32] yeah you didn't like that i'm sorry
[33:34] last time i was here there was some
[33:36] comments on youtube and it's like sorry
[33:38] i'm here again amen
[33:41] hallelujah
[33:42] that's the beauty of knowing who you are
[33:45] i just don't care amen
[33:47] hallelujah but see
[33:49] this is a time of the spirit of apostasy
[33:54] or it means defection from the word
[33:57] it just has to be
[33:59] and as we see that we know that we're in
[34:02] god's time amen
[34:03] yet it's also the time where the bride
[34:05] of christ is beginning to shine in her
[34:08] glory
[34:09] it's the time when when individual
[34:11] brides are being persecuted in message
[34:14] churches for what she believes
[34:16] and and she even has the
[34:18] manifestation of attitudes and healings
[34:22] and things in her life that god has
[34:24] completely taken yet they're looking at
[34:26] you like you're old-fashioned we don't
[34:29] want that in our church
[34:31] hallelujah
[34:33] amen
[34:34] but it's your time to shine amen and you
[34:37] just stay with that word and we're going
[34:39] to see what brother ram said in a while
[34:41] so it is the time of apostasy see that
[34:44] man of sin that that spirit of that man
[34:48] of sin is already here it has to be that
[34:50] way so that the man of sin can be
[34:51] manifested
[34:53] and so
[34:54] since it's already here then then then
[34:57] what happens the word not message
[35:00] theology the word gets watered down
[35:04] amen can't can we see that
[35:06] this gets watered down
[35:08] praise the lord jesus
[35:10] and so
[35:13] it's lord
[35:16] if it's watered down how can we be
[35:18] protected
[35:20] how can our families be protected
[35:22] how can the token be applied
[35:25] amen how can we keep our houses clean
[35:27] except the token is there and that token
[35:30] came because of revelation on the word
[35:32] for our day
[35:34] oh
[35:35] praise it works i promise you
[35:38] amen hallelujah
[35:41] but see that spirit of the church is to
[35:43] weaken the people
[35:47] yet prosper and grow in numbers
[35:50] yet have more people come into a message
[35:52] church
[35:54] right
[35:55] hallelujah
[35:58] like balaam
[36:01] i'm hard on myself
[36:04] just like balaam
[36:07] sold out for a few more people a little
[36:10] bit more money all right
[36:13] amen because we still live in laodicea
[36:15] we are in the bright age we're in the
[36:17] maturing age for the bride not the
[36:20] message people
[36:22] two different things and we're gonna see
[36:24] that tonight hey hey man
[36:26] completely different
[36:28] oh lady
[36:30] you say well you're not very uplifting
[36:31] tonight brother
[36:34] but i pray it'll do you good
[36:37] and so
[36:39] how does faith come
[36:41] oh you just go to church and if your
[36:43] pastor says you know
[36:45] this is what brother branham said and
[36:46] you know and and all this other stuff
[36:48] you see or that we do
[36:50] you know it doesn't matter
[36:54] see
[36:55] you should be going back into the word
[36:58] you should be going back into the
[37:00] messages
[37:01] and catching the spirit of the thing
[37:03] amen and then you should be saying hey
[37:07] deacons we need a meeting
[37:09] right
[37:11] hallelujah praise god and so faith comes
[37:14] by hearing the word of god nothing else
[37:17] i don't care how nice how beautiful how
[37:20] wonderful god doesn't come for that he
[37:23] comes forward people amen
[37:27] hallelujah
[37:29] amen and so faith comes by hearing the
[37:31] word and that's why god wants his holy
[37:34] ghost to dwell within you
[37:38] hey we need more than just enough to
[37:40] come to church
[37:41] we need to we need more enough to just
[37:44] to say amen to the word we need to have
[37:47] it in practice in our life
[37:50] hallelujah because all of us want to
[37:53] prosper and be in health right
[37:55] and i'm not talking so much about money
[37:57] prospering
[37:59] i'm talking about exceeding abundant
[38:02] above what we ask or think that is the
[38:04] difference between a church member and a
[38:06] holy ghost filled believer amen
[38:09] i live abundantly
[38:13] what about you
[38:15] how many lives
[38:16] abundantly well i'm not sure what you
[38:18] mean brother
[38:20] because i love the word
[38:23] and no one can talk me away from it
[38:26] no one can brainwash me
[38:30] that's why i mean i uh last year i
[38:33] preached in the denominational
[38:34] pentecostal church
[38:36] see some people would just kick you out
[38:38] just for that
[38:41] where else are they going to hear
[38:45] when i'm in the front row and the music
[38:47] is so loud that the
[38:50] one of the men that came with me went to
[38:52] the back
[38:55] oh man my head
[38:57] i haven't felt like that since my
[38:59] concert days in the world
[39:02] right amen
[39:04] but see when they begin to hear the word
[39:08] guess what happened
[39:10] they were like
[39:11] wow
[39:12] amen none of them may come fully into it
[39:16] but they heard the word amen
[39:19] hallelujah and so god wants us to
[39:22] prosper he wants us as we're going to
[39:24] see to be able to speak and go forward
[39:27] to know that our prayers are actually
[39:29] heard by god amen hallelujah and so a
[39:32] fully surrendered man or woman
[39:35] is omnipotent
[39:38] you are all powerful you are little
[39:40] messiahs i've said it plenty times
[39:43] before
[39:45] omnipotent means you hold sway or power
[39:49] over all things
[39:52] praise the lord
[39:54] you
[39:56] you young kids you adults
[40:00] you
[40:02] control your atmosphere you
[40:04] create the atmosphere you
[40:07] call things that are not as though they
[40:08] are amen it's you that that believes god
[40:12] so much that that you just you just say
[40:15] this is how it is because it's the word
[40:18] hallelujah
[40:21] that makes you want to run and jump
[40:23] doesn't it
[40:26] praise the lord
[40:28] see in mark 11 23 it says for verily i
[40:31] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[40:34] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[40:36] be thou cast into the sea
[40:38] and shall not doubt in his heart
[40:40] but shall believe that those things
[40:43] which he saith shall come to pass
[40:46] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[40:49] brother branham put that scripture with
[40:51] that quote about being omnipotent
[40:54] when two omnipotents meet
[40:57] you and god
[40:59] that's what the word will do for you
[41:02] you will have command and victory over
[41:05] every attitude in spirit that tries to
[41:08] come upon you
[41:10] hallelujah
[41:12] amen
[41:13] you won't sit there at the light and
[41:15] lust after the woman or the man walking
[41:17] across the street
[41:19] right
[41:21] amen
[41:23] are you tempted sometimes yes
[41:27] but you will not give in to sin
[41:30] are we like christ or we're not
[41:36] now we're getting someplace
[41:38] amen the word
[41:40] it is all the word amen you are all the
[41:43] word
[41:44] amen amen
[41:46] praise god
[41:48] see
[41:50] if god says it in his word
[41:55] then it's there for use
[41:56] for you to use
[41:58] and to glorify him not yourself
[42:02] that's why any ministry that glorifies
[42:05] himself is not of god
[42:07] even though they raise the dead heal the
[42:08] sick cast out devils know every bit of
[42:10] quote nailed the messages it's not of
[42:12] god
[42:14] hallelujah and so if it see it
[42:18] how will anybody know see that's the
[42:20] thing if we don't tell them what the
[42:22] word is
[42:25] because a lot of people don't want to
[42:26] hear that god sent a prophet
[42:28] and that can come
[42:30] maybe after the initial
[42:32] but they need to see
[42:34] see when when when people see your life
[42:37] and they see how you how you handle
[42:39] yourself then brother branham said when
[42:42] somebody says to another unbeliever
[42:45] i really like him i really like her
[42:49] that's witnessing
[42:52] because they're looking at the virtue of
[42:54] jesus christ coming out of you
[42:57] hallelujah and so
[42:59] we we know that people need to hear the
[43:01] word i had someone call me up the other
[43:03] day or text me and said oh man i miss
[43:06] your smiling face at work let's get
[43:08] together for breakfast complete
[43:10] unregented man
[43:14] and another one says oh we miss you here
[43:15] at work
[43:17] why is that
[43:19] be i i'm nothing but they miss the
[43:22] virtue
[43:24] they miss
[43:25] me studying they miss me talking about
[43:28] the lord they miss jesus christ amen
[43:32] hallelujah are you jesus tonight amen
[43:36] praise god
[43:38] hallelujah
[43:40] so how will they know except you live it
[43:43] and so
[43:44] too many people good people but see it's
[43:47] a lot of it is the ministry fault
[43:50] that's an absolute it's we've lost a
[43:52] generation or two because ministry have
[43:54] compromised on the word
[43:56] and so
[43:58] if if you presume you're dead
[44:02] if i went into a fire on the nozzle
[44:06] under my own impression
[44:09] i'd be dead
[44:12] there's
[44:12] you don't get a halfway dead
[44:16] right
[44:17] if i go up a stairway where there's fire
[44:20] burning below the hallway and i step on
[44:22] it i'm dead it's just like oh i can do
[44:25] what i want
[44:31] no you can't do what you want
[44:34] i don't care if you go to a message
[44:35] church you can't do what you want and if
[44:38] you've got that spirit tonight that's
[44:40] the devil amen
[44:42] you are jesus christ you do what he
[44:45] wants amen
[44:47] hallelujah if you presume you are dead
[44:50] because to presume is to venture without
[44:52] a authority
[44:54] yeah see we're trying to stretch us
[44:58] into more of god amen
[45:01] see i grew up in a home it wasn't
[45:03] perfect
[45:06] but when mistakes were made
[45:08] forgiveness
[45:10] dad would gather us
[45:12] please forgive me he getting to the
[45:14] pulpit he says i can't preach today
[45:17] he because my wife and i had a fight
[45:20] i asked her forgiveness will you forgive
[45:22] me
[45:25] praise god
[45:26] amen
[45:28] that's that
[45:30] spoke and so if it wasn't for that and
[45:34] seeing jesus christ alive
[45:37] i never would have came back i mean we
[45:39] know predestination but but in our in
[45:42] that experience of coming out of the
[45:44] world into christ
[45:46] that the devil couldn't tell me there
[45:48] was no god
[45:50] the devil couldn't tell me he wasn't
[45:51] alive amen
[45:53] and i've i already experienced
[45:55] forgiveness and what that was about and
[45:58] so
[45:59] see because god sent his word into this
[46:02] day
[46:03] see now our children could know who god
[46:06] is
[46:07] in your home they should know who mr and
[46:10] mrs jesus christ is
[46:13] praise god
[46:16] they should know what god will do
[46:20] there's nothing wrong with going to the
[46:21] doctor
[46:22] but we should be praying
[46:26] because it seems like the last several
[46:27] times that i've had things happen i went
[46:30] to the doctor but god healed me there
[46:35] i don't know why
[46:38] right
[46:40] and so
[46:42] they can see who god is
[46:45] and they can see what god will do that's
[46:47] all i want i don't care if my kids are
[46:49] brain surgeons
[46:52] i just
[46:53] i have a promise
[46:54] it's called the token and they will all
[46:56] be filled with the holy spirit that's
[46:58] all that matters to me
[47:02] see
[47:02] romans says all things work together for
[47:05] good to them that love the lord
[47:08] to those that are called
[47:10] according to his purpose
[47:12] right see that's it's written about you
[47:16] praise the lord
[47:17] and so the atmosphere
[47:20] of a living god must be in our homes
[47:23] praise god
[47:27] you fill in all the blanks what
[47:28] shouldn't be there
[47:31] well i just do it to unwind a little bit
[47:35] okay
[47:37] tell god that
[47:39] right
[47:40] we just watch all these videos you know
[47:42] they're harmless
[47:45] right
[47:47] romans 10 14 15 it says
[47:51] how then shall they call on him and whom
[47:53] they have not believed
[47:55] and how should they believe in him of
[47:57] whom they have not heard
[47:58] and how shall they hear without a
[48:00] preacher
[48:01] and how shall they preach except they be
[48:03] sent
[48:04] as it is written how beautiful are the
[48:06] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[48:08] peace and bring glad tidings of good of
[48:11] good tidings amen
[48:14] see
[48:15] the one who stands in this pulpit
[48:18] has to know
[48:20] not presume
[48:22] and you are obligated to make this
[48:25] person in this pulpit toe the line by
[48:28] the word
[48:29] amen
[48:30] gone are the days where you just
[48:33] blatantly to say
[48:34] oh whatever you say
[48:37] right that that went out with
[48:39] probably in the 60s or 70s
[48:41] or it should have
[48:43] right
[48:44] and so in john 10 4-5 it says and and
[48:48] when he put us forth his own sheep he
[48:50] goeth before them and the sheep follow
[48:53] him for they know his voice
[48:56] and a stranger they will not follow
[48:58] but will flee from him for they know not
[49:01] the voice of strangers and you're
[49:02] probably sitting there go well how do i
[49:05] know who's right
[49:06] amen
[49:07] this is not about who you know is right
[49:10] this is about you knowing that you know
[49:13] it's right
[49:14] this is about individual experience
[49:17] this is about and you say well how will
[49:19] i know because i'll just say what he
[49:22] said because god will bring this to pass
[49:25] in your life you just have to ask
[49:28] amen praise god
[49:31] that's the only way i know that i'm i'm
[49:33] saved and full of the holy ghost is that
[49:35] i've been i've been growing my family my
[49:37] wife we've been growing
[49:40] hallelujah
[49:42] i don't want anybody else i i just want
[49:45] god i want his word amen
[49:48] and so
[49:49] for the person coming behind this desk
[49:53] each person has to meet god in a
[49:55] supernatural way
[49:57] that's that's just that's what brother
[49:59] graham said
[50:00] you cannot get up here if you haven't
[50:02] met god in some sort of supernatural way
[50:06] hallelujah
[50:07] because then you're presuming because
[50:09] when times get tough when they get hard
[50:12] amen
[50:14] then you can look back and say i know
[50:16] god called me
[50:18] i know what he did i know how he spoke
[50:21] to me and i'm not going anywhere
[50:24] i'm not going to run out i'm not going
[50:26] to desert these people
[50:28] who cares if they if the ties are 20 a
[50:31] month amen
[50:32] hallelujah if you start preaching the
[50:34] word then things are going to change
[50:36] amen
[50:37] praise god and so
[50:40] it is through god called ministers
[50:43] not all ministers are called
[50:46] it's through god called ministers that
[50:49] this word is taught and preached so that
[50:51] you and i can know what the truth is
[50:54] amen by this word
[50:59] oh hallelujah brother branham said in
[51:02] exposition of the seven church ages
[51:04] he has placed his church in the care of
[51:07] god ordained spirit-filled word living
[51:12] that's important to me
[51:14] who men who lead the people through
[51:17] feeding
[51:18] through feeding them with the word
[51:21] amen let's just try living what what he
[51:24] said
[51:25] besides going beyond what he said let's
[51:27] just try to
[51:28] it's like a balloon the message is like
[51:31] a balloon and we are like that second
[51:33] balloon in there that that god is
[51:35] pumping up well what is happening is
[51:37] it's expanding and spanning expanding to
[51:40] the full revelation of the first balloon
[51:44] we don't go beyond those things
[51:46] see this this word is so that it's for
[51:49] the bride this is the elisha ministry
[51:52] for the bride amen because we have to do
[51:55] the greater works amen
[51:59] overcoming evil that's a greater work
[52:03] talking about your brother or sister
[52:05] that's the greater work
[52:09] and so
[52:10] we have different message gods
[52:14] but there's only one
[52:16] right there's only one revelation
[52:19] i'm not responsible for all those other
[52:21] ones
[52:22] because they're not they are not
[52:24] producing anything
[52:27] eternal
[52:32] amen
[52:35] eternal is the young people changing the
[52:38] parents changing
[52:40] god having preeminence that's that's
[52:42] what should be happening in our churches
[52:45] hallelujah
[52:46] and so there's different message gods
[52:49] everywhere but see god ordained his his
[52:52] revelation of this word to free the
[52:55] people to take you out of this age amen
[52:58] i think it was sister norman or brother
[53:00] one of the they they had a dream about
[53:02] those people in that cave with nine inch
[53:04] bars and brother branham was in front of
[53:07] it and and
[53:08] and the voice says let my people go and
[53:10] he goes i don't know i don't know how
[53:12] they're too big
[53:13] and all of a sudden jesus the word
[53:15] appeared into the midst and he says you
[53:18] gates of hell and i can't remember the
[53:20] rest but they just exploded and the
[53:22] people are running out praise the lord
[53:24] i'm free amen the word has set me free
[53:29] amen
[53:30] oh
[53:32] glory to god amen
[53:34] the word
[53:37] amen
[53:38] amen
[53:39] this
[53:41] which is the message
[53:43] this is jesus christ
[53:45] hallelujah and so
[53:48] the gospel has to be preached in the
[53:50] demonstration and the power of god
[53:53] and it's not for the world to see you
[53:56] know who cares if they catch it on
[53:58] internet
[54:00] you know what happens
[54:03] i'm sure things happen all the time here
[54:05] that the rest of of the world never
[54:07] knows
[54:09] just like us
[54:10] world doesn't know
[54:13] that god's still alive
[54:15] amen
[54:16] in that body
[54:17] praise the lord
[54:18] but see
[54:20] the revelation of jesus christ for this
[54:22] day
[54:23] is so the bible will be a new book
[54:27] to those that love him
[54:29] this will be the new book
[54:31] amen
[54:33] see you still have to come through the
[54:35] cross you still have to be washed in the
[54:37] blood of the lamb you still have to feed
[54:40] on this word amen
[54:41] and so don't don't give me your
[54:44] associations because i'm going to vomit
[54:47] right
[54:48] i really don't care
[54:50] are you saved are you sanctified
[54:54] are you full of the holy ghost and are
[54:56] you growing through the stature of the
[54:58] perfect man into adoption that's what i
[55:00] want amen
[55:02] hallelujah and so
[55:04] my goal or chad's goal whoever's goal
[55:07] this is not about to minister to be
[55:10] invited back because i don't care
[55:13] right
[55:16] i love being in that position
[55:19] if no one pays tithes again praise the
[55:21] lord i don't care
[55:23] it's just that they are in
[55:25] you know they won't be blessed anymore
[55:27] but for me i don't care
[55:32] see it's our goal is for the
[55:35] congregation not to like us
[55:41] has anybody played organized sports
[55:46] his or her goal is for you not
[55:48] to like them
[55:51] it's to train you
[55:53] and drive you to a point and past that
[55:56] point
[55:57] that you never thought you could do
[56:02] amen and you don't like them sometimes
[56:06] praise the lord
[56:08] but our our purpose as a minister is to
[56:11] deliver the unadulterated word of god to
[56:14] the people and see you grow
[56:17] if if i lived in a shack just seeing
[56:20] people receive jesus christ in the word
[56:22] that's the greatest reward i could ever
[56:24] have amen
[56:26] and so
[56:27] we know that the main thing is
[56:30] demonstrating
[56:31] demonstrating to this is ministry
[56:34] demonstrating a true spiritual
[56:37] relationship
[56:39] between god and man the minister we have
[56:42] to demonstrate that we have to have our
[56:45] kids see that we must have the world see
[56:48] that even when we don't think they're
[56:49] watching
[56:50] but that has to be because we want the
[56:53] sheep to have the same thing
[56:56] praise the lord jesus and so what
[56:58] happens when you preach the word then
[57:01] the spirit of god transforms those that
[57:04] hear the word
[57:06] amen but see all of us we've been we've
[57:08] been in the place where the preacher
[57:10] says something is like oh
[57:14] but at the same time you're just going
[57:16] lord
[57:17] if if that's you then
[57:19] then then reveal it to me amen
[57:22] praise the lord
[57:24] and so
[57:25] because of this day of apostasy this
[57:27] great defection from the word
[57:31] it puts christ on the outside
[57:34] amen
[57:36] the spirit of the age is
[57:38] defection from the word
[57:41] that's what paves for the man of sin
[57:43] and we know that in jesus time he says i
[57:46] come in my father's name and he didn't
[57:47] receive me
[57:49] well he said but if another will come in
[57:52] his name you'll receive them that's
[57:54] exactly what has happened that that
[57:56] spirit of denomination is of the devil
[57:59] is the other name and people suck it up
[58:02] like it's cotton candy
[58:05] amen
[58:07] well brother we want to we want a church
[58:09] that has
[58:10] a little more programs for our kids
[58:14] okay have a nice life
[58:18] i pray for him
[58:20] but you're judging a church on that
[58:23] right you're judging a church on the
[58:24] number of people are there you're
[58:26] judging the church on the
[58:29] music
[58:30] you're judging the people on
[58:32] on on programs for old and young people
[58:36] come on
[58:37] we should be more mature than that
[58:40] amen we should be judging it by you
[58:43] actually prayed through
[58:44] and you know beyond shadow of doubt if i
[58:46] came and put a gun to your head right
[58:48] now and says is this your church you
[58:51] should be able to say you can shoot me i
[58:53] know this is my church
[58:56] but now when you get offended over here
[58:58] over here over here
[59:01] musical churches
[59:05] amen
[59:07] hallelujah
[59:09] i say that so we know
[59:12] this is not my usual message amen i'm
[59:14] sorry
[59:16] i still believe that he's a miracle
[59:17] worker
[59:19] because he is
[59:21] hallelujah but but you'll see where i'm
[59:23] going
[59:29] see another name
[59:31] people will receive jesus but when he
[59:33] comes as the plain
[59:36] non-beautiful
[59:37] jesus christ
[59:40] yeah it's just not exciting enough
[59:42] brother
[59:44] that time when they come in they looked
[59:46] in our church brother you only have a
[59:47] piano in oregon
[59:54] see my inside voice wanted to say yeah
[59:58] the dead are still raised the sick are
[1:00:00] still healed
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] see
[1:00:15] but for the bride and we're getting
[1:00:17] we're over halfway
[1:00:19] for the bride in our day
[1:00:22] those who are led
[1:00:24] by the spirit
[1:00:26] and the love of the word
[1:00:29] you will have a spirit of sacrifice
[1:00:31] as a parent you will give up maybe what
[1:00:34] you like so your kids can have
[1:00:37] things that god wants in their home amen
[1:00:40] you will the the man
[1:00:42] is the head of the home but he's also
[1:00:44] the greatest
[1:00:45] person to sacrifice for his family
[1:00:48] because for the husband it goes god
[1:00:50] family and you
[1:00:51] and so it may be mean giving up things
[1:00:54] so that your wife can be at peace in the
[1:00:57] home
[1:00:58] amen so the kids can be at peace in the
[1:01:00] home
[1:01:01] and so
[1:01:02] those who are led by the spirit amen who
[1:01:06] love the word that is a great stabilizer
[1:01:09] brother brown said
[1:01:10] the word is the stabilizer
[1:01:13] it is the living word that is the
[1:01:15] stabilizer
[1:01:16] not well brother so and so oh he
[1:01:18] preached a wonderful message oh i just
[1:01:20] love the word
[1:01:23] that that's
[1:01:24] it's it's it's only the word if this is
[1:01:26] in it
[1:01:28] it's only the word if he's living it
[1:01:30] it's only the word if it's being
[1:01:32] manifested from him
[1:01:34] oh
[1:01:35] hallelujah
[1:01:37] and so
[1:01:39] the word is different from what your
[1:01:40] church believes
[1:01:43] sometimes
[1:01:46] or what they teach sometimes
[1:01:48] see your you might be insulated here the
[1:01:51] rest of the message world it's a mess
[1:01:58] but this is what's alive
[1:02:02] and it's personal to you that's what you
[1:02:04] need to find amen and so
[1:02:07] see god did not design us to contact him
[1:02:10] with our intellect
[1:02:13] but some of us
[1:02:16] we're all made different right we have
[1:02:18] different likes and dislikes god gives
[1:02:20] us a pastor who fills that void right
[1:02:24] but see god is not known by our
[1:02:26] intellect
[1:02:27] and god is not known by our emotions or
[1:02:32] our flesh
[1:02:33] because if you're desperate
[1:02:36] and you repent and are baptized
[1:02:39] he promises to give you the holy ghost
[1:02:41] so you come up out of that pool saying
[1:02:43] thank you lord jesus you saved me you
[1:02:46] cleansed me you i've been baptized in
[1:02:49] your name and i thank you for what you
[1:02:52] have already done
[1:02:54] and then you go thanking him and you
[1:02:57] will see the growth
[1:03:00] hallelujah praise the lord but see
[1:03:04] it is
[1:03:06] it god we're not made to contact god
[1:03:09] with our flesh or spirit
[1:03:12] though we're emotional people sometimes
[1:03:16] but it is faith which is the substance
[1:03:19] and that comes by the word only amen
[1:03:21] hallelujah and so i just want to tell
[1:03:24] you tonight no matter if i feel don't
[1:03:27] you love those mountaintop times where
[1:03:29] you're just praise god and you know
[1:03:31] everything is going and god's answering
[1:03:33] all these prayers
[1:03:39] see it doesn't matter if i'm in that
[1:03:40] state
[1:03:41] or i don't feel anything amen amen
[1:03:44] in my emotion or my flesh but see i get
[1:03:47] up and there's a song in my heart
[1:03:51] right
[1:03:52] there's joy and peace within there but
[1:03:54] this outside
[1:03:56] you try studying when you're tired
[1:03:59] see if you're not called
[1:04:02] it would it would demoralize you
[1:04:05] but see when you're called you'll study
[1:04:07] when you're tired
[1:04:10] because you don't feel him but you're
[1:04:12] trusting in the leadership of the lord
[1:04:14] to do it amen
[1:04:15] and so
[1:04:17] i don't
[1:04:18] i don't judge my walk with god by how i
[1:04:20] feel or what i see
[1:04:22] i judge it by the word coming to pass
[1:04:25] and that i want to follow every word so
[1:04:28] i'm led in the right direction amen
[1:04:30] see john 5 30 it says i can of my own
[1:04:33] self do nothing as i hear i judge
[1:04:37] and my judgment is just because i seek
[1:04:40] not my own will but the will of the
[1:04:42] father which has sent me
[1:04:45] i
[1:04:46] and my father are one amen
[1:04:49] john 10 30.
[1:04:52] that's me
[1:04:55] that's you
[1:04:57] i don't seek my own will my judgment is
[1:04:59] just
[1:05:00] oh brother you're pretty cocky
[1:05:04] no i'm just being her
[1:05:11] you're just being her
[1:05:16] do you realize that just because you go
[1:05:18] from this dimension to the next you
[1:05:20] don't change
[1:05:23] and you will be judging the the saints
[1:05:27] and so
[1:05:28] if you don't know you're that here then
[1:05:30] you won't be that there
[1:05:34] amen i'm here to help lift this up a
[1:05:38] little higher
[1:05:39] to accept brother chad is he's going in
[1:05:42] the right direction i believe
[1:05:44] amen amen he's not my idol i don't
[1:05:47] consult with brother chad website
[1:05:53] i don't need him to tell him that to
[1:05:55] tell me i'm going in the right direction
[1:05:57] but i appreciate him i love him
[1:06:00] and it's good to see people that just
[1:06:02] want the word
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:05] but see
[1:06:06] you have to know that i my father are
[1:06:08] one
[1:06:10] and that i don't do anything until i
[1:06:12] hear from god that's why all of your
[1:06:15] decisions slow
[1:06:16] down because you're talking to your
[1:06:19] husband
[1:06:20] amen and so
[1:06:24] our experience will bring emotion when
[1:06:27] god got a hold of me i was bawling and
[1:06:29] snotting and oh it was i was a mess
[1:06:33] but my experience is not defined on that
[1:06:36] i know something happened but it wasn't
[1:06:38] because i was worked up or crying
[1:06:43] hallelujah
[1:06:45] it is because
[1:06:47] he did something and so it's not because
[1:06:50] you agree with some intellectual
[1:06:52] stimulating phrase that some teacher
[1:06:55] said
[1:06:57] that is not the evidence of the holy
[1:06:59] ghost the evidence of the holy ghost is
[1:07:02] that you
[1:07:03] believe every word of god
[1:07:06] believe every word of god not believe
[1:07:10] every word of god you believe every word
[1:07:13] of god
[1:07:14] that's why the word of god is so
[1:07:15] important to us tonight amen
[1:07:17] hallelujah
[1:07:19] amen and so we always have him i always
[1:07:23] have them in my heart when i make the
[1:07:25] biggest blunders or mistakes in the
[1:07:27] world
[1:07:28] i don't want to throw in the towel but
[1:07:30] i'm just crawling on my knees back to
[1:07:33] god for forgiveness that shows something
[1:07:35] is different
[1:07:38] hallelujah
[1:07:39] he's always he's always ruling you he's
[1:07:43] always reigning in you what are you sad
[1:07:45] about
[1:07:47] well they made us wear masks
[1:07:53] let me put you back in the time of jesus
[1:07:56] when the romans could do anything they
[1:07:57] wanted to you
[1:08:04] there's going to be greater trials
[1:08:07] i hope that is the least
[1:08:13] i have rights brother rich
[1:08:15] no you don't
[1:08:18] you have a right to serve god
[1:08:21] and to do what the word says
[1:08:23] praise the lord
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:26] hallelujah
[1:08:28] see your home life in your church life
[1:08:30] exactly the same
[1:08:33] you driving down i-75 is the same as you
[1:08:36] are in church
[1:08:37] amen and so
[1:08:40] we do we have greater storms coming
[1:08:42] folks
[1:08:43] brother banham says
[1:08:45] stay
[1:08:46] with the word
[1:08:49] stay with the revelation of jesus christ
[1:08:52] stay with christ is the mystery of god
[1:08:55] revealed stay with his revelation amen
[1:08:59] hallelujah and so no matter how we feel
[1:09:02] during these storm times there are
[1:09:04] challenging times absolutely
[1:09:08] but just stay with the word that's all
[1:09:10] god wants
[1:09:12] brother brown said there's no special
[1:09:14] church
[1:09:17] i used to hear that back in the 80s and
[1:09:19] 90s all the time oh come to our church
[1:09:21] we have all the revelation
[1:09:28] where are they now
[1:09:32] i don't like it
[1:09:34] do you think we like to see people fail
[1:09:37] well they just weren't predestinated
[1:09:39] oh give me a break if you have that
[1:09:41] attitude i want you down here in the
[1:09:43] altar right now
[1:09:46] oh they're just see for us oh they're
[1:09:49] just pentecostal
[1:09:56] last time i checked we're sovereign
[1:10:00] last time i checked
[1:10:01] that brother bam says that after the
[1:10:04] seals we have a
[1:10:05] day of pentecost pentecostal experience
[1:10:08] which means we just believe everything
[1:10:09] he says
[1:10:11] don't try to box up jesus christ in your
[1:10:14] little mightier than thou attitude
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] because you know what's going to happen
[1:10:22] god is going to cut your legs off
[1:10:25] and let you be on the ground to where
[1:10:27] that little
[1:10:28] unrevelated message person is going to
[1:10:30] be the one to help you
[1:10:32] and you know i don't care i
[1:10:35] i don't have hurt feelings at all i just
[1:10:37] want us to recognize christ amen
[1:10:40] and so
[1:10:41] see in our day
[1:10:43] we have a tendency
[1:10:44] to glorify everything else except the
[1:10:47] word and what god does
[1:10:49] we're glorifying men and we should not
[1:10:52] do that amen and so it's not about his
[1:10:55] word it's it's about everything else
[1:10:58] when it should be all about jesus christ
[1:11:01] the word
[1:11:03] oh hallelujah
[1:11:05] don't add anything to it don't take away
[1:11:07] anything from it well it doesn't mean
[1:11:09] that today oh
[1:11:11] shut up
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:18] see we're way past the denominational
[1:11:21] pentecostals being the shock
[1:11:25] it's right here
[1:11:27] it's the message churches they are the
[1:11:29] shock now
[1:11:32] hallelujah
[1:11:34] it is here
[1:11:38] but the bride is growing within every
[1:11:40] church
[1:11:42] and she's being protected until the time
[1:11:45] that they say i can't take your your
[1:11:47] little butt on the back of your head
[1:11:49] anymore and you won't listen to our
[1:11:51] message music anymore and you won't
[1:11:53] watch our message movies anymore and you
[1:11:55] won't you won't run around with us kids
[1:11:57] and do things message kids do
[1:12:02] let's say we don't want you anymore
[1:12:04] you say
[1:12:05] i love you
[1:12:06] i pray for you blessed be the name of
[1:12:08] the lord anyway amen
[1:12:10] amen you'll be there until they
[1:12:12] disfellowship you
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:15] and so
[1:12:18] who would have ever thought our ministry
[1:12:20] would be explaining away the word
[1:12:27] you better be grateful for a ministry
[1:12:30] here that does not try to explain away
[1:12:32] the word of god
[1:12:34] hallelujah god is his own interpreter of
[1:12:37] this message amen
[1:12:38] hallelujah
[1:12:40] amen but see it's that spirit trying to
[1:12:43] render the people void of life and life
[1:12:47] is not
[1:12:49] and i'm not being blasphemous but it's
[1:12:51] not jumping around hopping and and until
[1:12:54] you're out of your head god can use that
[1:12:58] but it is about you coming to church
[1:13:01] prayed up ready to worship and then the
[1:13:04] song service just it just feels like
[1:13:06] whoa something is happening here amen
[1:13:09] and then the minister comes into the
[1:13:10] pulpit and it just goes on from there
[1:13:13] and you're just rejoicing amen
[1:13:16] hallelujah because life is here
[1:13:20] oh the life of christ is pleased amen
[1:13:24] amen don't worry there's one lord
[1:13:27] there's one baptism there's one faith
[1:13:29] there's only one message hallelujah
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:35] hallelujah
[1:13:40] this message
[1:13:42] of life
[1:13:45] was to call out
[1:13:46] you
[1:13:48] and equip you
[1:13:50] to be an overcomer
[1:13:52] oh
[1:13:53] let's just drop our isms let's drop what
[1:13:55] we think
[1:13:56] amen let's just let's just do what he
[1:13:59] says
[1:14:00] amen i don't care i'll still like you
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:07] all i wanted to do god equipped you for
[1:14:10] this day
[1:14:11] just take what he says then amen
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:16] amen see when the children of israel
[1:14:19] came out of egypt only two of the
[1:14:21] original
[1:14:22] minus the children went in
[1:14:25] because we know 20 years and older went
[1:14:26] in but but the others could not go in
[1:14:30] why was it they were in a message church
[1:14:34] they listened to a message pastor but
[1:14:37] they refused to follow the word of the
[1:14:41] lord
[1:14:44] they were too scared
[1:14:45] oh
[1:14:47] i don't i think we need to get our kids
[1:14:49] into another church that has more
[1:14:51] progress because they're just going into
[1:14:53] the world well let me tell you sister
[1:14:55] let me tell you brother why don't you
[1:14:57] get on your knees and pray throughs for
[1:14:59] those children why don't you take your
[1:15:01] experience pray through so that they can
[1:15:04] see that you actually love them
[1:15:12] hallelujah
[1:15:13] he gave us this word
[1:15:15] to equip you to be victorious
[1:15:18] amen see the rest of those 2 million
[1:15:21] they had all the signs and wonders and
[1:15:23] miracles they had a message pastor but
[1:15:26] they didn't have faith
[1:15:28] two of the original had faith
[1:15:30] hallelujah amen
[1:15:34] see satan exalts himself
[1:15:37] above all that is called god brother
[1:15:39] brown said and god is the word and any
[1:15:42] church that exalts their church over
[1:15:44] this word
[1:15:45] it's a lie
[1:15:47] it has to be this word it has to be
[1:15:50] jesus christ and then you want to see
[1:15:52] god move in your midst you want to see
[1:15:53] god heal the sick raise the dead cast
[1:15:56] out devils meet all your financial needs
[1:15:58] save your kids that's when you'll see
[1:16:00] that amen
[1:16:02] hallelujah
[1:16:04] see the devil wants you worshiping him
[1:16:08] and not
[1:16:09] not the word
[1:16:10] he wants to be exalted and too many good
[1:16:13] people think they are but they are
[1:16:15] they're they're not amen and and people
[1:16:18] always i always feel like they're saying
[1:16:20] well who do you think you are to tell us
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:24] i'm
[1:16:26] mrs jesus christ
[1:16:29] take it or leave it
[1:16:32] i know where i stand do you
[1:16:36] praise the lord amen
[1:16:40] that's the kind of confidence we need
[1:16:43] hallelujah you should be said there
[1:16:45] brother rich yes sir amen amen
[1:16:47] hallelujah but see satan exalts himself
[1:16:51] above what is called god the word of god
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:55] and so
[1:16:56] the devil wants that
[1:16:58] and in the days of jesus the people in
[1:17:02] their
[1:17:03] message of the hour chose
[1:17:05] a murderer instead of the word
[1:17:10] amen and we've done the same thing i'm
[1:17:12] afraid
[1:17:13] not the bride but see i'm
[1:17:18] we are the bride if we're converted amen
[1:17:20] if we love god but but i want to see
[1:17:22] everybody
[1:17:24] i want to see all people come to christ
[1:17:27] i don't want to have see people with bad
[1:17:29] attitudes amen i want them to know that
[1:17:32] they know that they know
[1:17:34] and so the battle today is between man's
[1:17:37] idea and the vindicated word
[1:17:41] the vindicated word the word that comes
[1:17:44] to pass in your life when you have that
[1:17:45] need amen
[1:17:48] and so
[1:17:49] the devil has his children
[1:17:51] but i don't want to think that
[1:17:59] but just because you go to a message
[1:18:00] church you're not marrying my kids
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:08] just because you go to preaching a
[1:18:10] message doesn't mean you're preaching in
[1:18:11] our pulpit
[1:18:13] no
[1:18:15] nope
[1:18:16] but see
[1:18:18] the bride is rich
[1:18:20] with gold
[1:18:23] the gold of god
[1:18:25] she is tried in the fire
[1:18:28] and she manifests the victory of her
[1:18:30] husband amen and it manifests the
[1:18:33] character of jesus christ who would have
[1:18:35] ever thought that rich cobb would be
[1:18:37] that way how many was in the world you
[1:18:40] you look back and you say how am i here
[1:18:43] today
[1:18:48] how
[1:18:50] it's his sovereign grace
[1:18:53] and and he's it's his character that
[1:18:55] he's building us see it's god's
[1:18:57] revelation of his word that carries her
[1:18:59] above the world
[1:19:01] it carries her and keeps her from all
[1:19:03] that is called worldliness that's why
[1:19:05] somebody with the holy ghost can never
[1:19:07] absolutely not go back into the world
[1:19:13] amen god keeps you spotless
[1:19:16] you are perfect and entire wanting
[1:19:19] nothing
[1:19:20] you are you have spot and wrinkled
[1:19:22] there's no spot and wrinkle you are
[1:19:24] perfect you know why brother brown says
[1:19:27] he hears your voice but he sees you
[1:19:29] through the blood
[1:19:31] that's actually he doesn't even see you
[1:19:33] he said he just hears the voice
[1:19:37] oh
[1:19:38] glory to god
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:44] praise god
[1:19:48] see
[1:19:50] in our day
[1:19:52] christ in the true church
[1:19:55] is the continuation of the
[1:19:59] starts of the b
[1:20:01] book
[1:20:04] x yes
[1:20:05] hallelujah
[1:20:07] what made them different
[1:20:09] just just take away all the signs and
[1:20:11] wonders of miracles they said yes to all
[1:20:14] the word amen
[1:20:17] that's what god wants that's why we are
[1:20:19] a continuation of the book of acts
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:23] hallelujah
[1:20:25] praise the lord
[1:20:30] brother brown said this is the time when
[1:20:32] the devil is trying to destroy god's
[1:20:34] people
[1:20:34] and the word of god
[1:20:39] not in my life
[1:20:41] not in your life
[1:20:44] the devil's trying to discourage people
[1:20:46] from standing alone
[1:20:48] on the word
[1:20:49] you have to be prepared for that to
[1:20:51] stand totally alone
[1:20:54] hallelujah
[1:20:56] and so he says the devil wants to
[1:20:58] discredit the word of god to the people
[1:21:01] because
[1:21:03] he wants to say you know god's a healer
[1:21:06] but maybe not for you
[1:21:07] god saves and fills with the holy ghost
[1:21:10] but maybe not for you no he did it once
[1:21:13] it's all for you amen
[1:21:15] healing is el shaddai
[1:21:17] amen it's the double-breasted it's both
[1:21:19] spiritual and physical healing they are
[1:21:21] together amen hallelujah and if he saves
[1:21:25] somebody one time then he will save you
[1:21:28] the same amen hallelujah and so
[1:21:35] why are people going back to
[1:21:36] denominational pentecostal
[1:21:38] things i i'm old enough where i i was
[1:21:41] there and i and you can still watch all
[1:21:44] the videos from the 50s and 60s
[1:21:48] why
[1:21:50] well we've been held down too long
[1:21:52] people have forgotten what the holy
[1:21:54] ghost is like
[1:21:58] really
[1:22:00] you forgot that god saved you and
[1:22:02] cleaned you up
[1:22:03] you forgot that he supernaturally put
[1:22:06] you and your wife together and now your
[1:22:07] kids are serving god you forgot that
[1:22:10] you forgot that he's the the same
[1:22:12] yesterday today and forever you forgot
[1:22:15] that what in the world is being preached
[1:22:18] then
[1:22:19] not the word
[1:22:22] hallelujah or they want to go back to be
[1:22:25] a baptist intellectualism an
[1:22:27] intellectualist
[1:22:32] one of the missionaries that brother
[1:22:34] otto kony that we listen to is his
[1:22:37] testimonies and he had one of the
[1:22:39] overseers fly into his village and and
[1:22:42] they're having church and everything and
[1:22:44] he looked at otto he goes i thought you
[1:22:46] were making this a baptist church
[1:22:48] because they were loud
[1:22:53] it's like
[1:22:54] people say i thought you were making
[1:22:56] this a message church no i'm making this
[1:22:58] the church of god amen
[1:23:06] we're speaking of the living word
[1:23:08] tonight
[1:23:09] and so
[1:23:11] as she gets that true revelation he says
[1:23:14] of the true church of yourself
[1:23:16] what she is
[1:23:18] you are mrs jesus christ
[1:23:21] and what you stand for the word

[1:23:33] hate you and despitefully use you those
[1:23:35] are greater works
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:41] and
[1:23:42] she will be an invincible army
[1:23:48] that's what the word will do for you
[1:23:51] hallelujah you will receive
[1:23:53] the revelation of the two spirits event
[1:23:56] that are in the church and you will be
[1:23:58] able to discern that
[1:23:59] and you will be able to withstand that
[1:24:02] not by

[1:24:09] god satan i rebuked that attitude in the
[1:24:12] name of jesus

[1:24:16] and so
