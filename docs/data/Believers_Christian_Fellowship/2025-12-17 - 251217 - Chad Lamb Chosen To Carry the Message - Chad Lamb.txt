As brother Chad comes this evening, let's sing the winds of faith. There are two roots that you may take, one by side and one by faith. Take the word of God. Not what you see. What you believe is what will be. Set your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's by grace set your weak to the wings of faith. What's your need? What's your cry? What's your mountain? Much too high. See the word of God and by and by it will move for you will fly. Set your reach to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher plane. Do not struggle. It's my grace that your wings to wash in the sky. He does not struggle. He does not strive for the power that makes him rise is already in the sky. Set your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's by grace that your wings to winds of pain. Watch the bride in this time. She does not struggle. She does not struggle. For the power that will make her rise is already down inside. We'll set our wings to the wings of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's my grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. Set your wings. Set your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's my grace. Set your wings to the winds of &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's bow our heads together as we pray. Lord Jesus, once again, we're grateful, Lord, that you've watched over us and you've kept us. You've protected us, Lord, and you've drawn us back together again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God, the privilege to stand with our brothers and sisters and sing of your glory is tremendous, Lord. For we sing in spirit and in truth with revelation and understanding that you have granted to us in this hour. And it means so much to us, Lord, to be able to give back to you praises for you have done so much for us. And God, now as we look into your word, we're asking that you would come, Lord, and that you would speak through these lips of clay. that you give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us. May your word, Lord, rest solidly in our soul, Lord. May it grow and bring us, Lord, into all that you desire for us to be in this hour that we live. Strengthen us, shape us, Lord. Anoint us, and use us for your glory. We pray as we commit ourselves to you and surrender to you under your hand this evening. In Jesus Christ's name, we ask for these blessings. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. While we're standing, if we could turn to the book of Jeremiah, we'll get right into the word. Man, I just want to remind you of the schedule of this next week. Next Tuesday will be our midweek service, December 23rd. So, uh uh not next Wednesday, but next Tuesday. And then a week after that on Wednesday, will be our watch night service at 8:00 p.m. And so, we hope you're all able to make that. Also, if you've got a special in your heart, you'd like to share a song special, please uh let Brother Mike know so we can get it on the schedule. We always enjoy that night of worship and fellowship and testimonies and a time to cap off the year and look forward to the next year together. So, we're looking forward to that as well. In Jeremiah, let's look at chapter 1. Jeremiah chapter 1 and uh we'll we'll read verse four and five. Jeremiah 1 4 and 5. Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. And before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Amen. God bless you as you have your seat. And God bless us as we look at his word. Amen. What a statement he made to Jeremiah. Jeremiah, he he says, uh, before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. Oh, what consolation from God Almighty that he knew him before he was conceived, before he was formed in the belly. Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. So Jeremiah was not a prophet by choice. &gt;&gt; He was not a prophet by his will. He was not a prophet unto the nations because of anything he had done or anything he desired or anything he decided. Amen. This was decided before he was born. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What else could he do? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. If you'll turn with me to the book of Acts. If we could bring the PowerPoint up. Turn with me to the book of Acts. Uh I want to preach on chosen to carry the message. So Jeremiah was chosen to carry a message. And we look at Acts chapter 9 together. We're going to look at the Apostle Paul. Acts chapter nine verse one says, "And Saul, this was Paul before he was Saul, and Saul yet breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem." And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there shined around about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what will thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do." Let's go down to verse 10. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananas. And to him, said the Lord in a vision, Ananas. And he said, "Behold, I am here, Lord." And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he prayth and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananas coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight. Then Ananas answered,"Lord, I have heard by many of this man how much evil he have done to the saints at Jerusalem, and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name." But the Lord said unto him, "Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake." So here we look at the calling of the Apostle Paul. He was Saul. And as Saul, he was raging, absolutely raging against the disciples, against the Christians. And he was wreaking havoc amongst the churches is what the Bible said. Amen. And and he was doing horrible things. And even Ananas, when God told Ananas, "This is what I want you to do. I want you to go, Amen. pray for Saul." Amen. And he says, "Oh Lord, I've heard I've heard of this man. I've heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to the saints at Jerusalem." So here is a man that was doing evil to the saints of God, &gt;&gt; persecuting Jesus Christ as he persecuted the body of Christ. And Jesus even said,"Wh persecutest thou me?" He said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus whom you persecutest. Why is it so hard for thee to kick against the pricks?" And he trembling and astonished said, "Lord, what do you want me to do?" He didn't know he was persecuting the Lord, but he was doing evil. Amen. And Ananas knew this man. He knew the reputation. He knew the evil was doing. And he was he was questioning God on God's uh desire to send him to Saul. But God said to him, "Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me." I chose him before. When did God choose him? Amen. God chose him before. How far before? I believe before the foundation of the world. But certainly in this text, he chose him before his conversion. He chose him before he was right. He chose him while he was evil. While he was Saul, while he didn't know the Lord, while he was wreaking havoc of the churches and doing evil to the saints in Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; God chose him not because he was good. God chose him by his grace. &gt;&gt; And he was a chosen vessel unto me, listen, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. So he says, "I have chosen." HE'S A VESSEL THAT I HAVE chosen to bear my name to the Gentiles and to kings and to the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Now listen, you know who he hasn't got permission from yet or who he hasn't asked permission of yet? Saul. &gt;&gt; He already told was the rest of his life. Hey, listen. He's a chosen vessel to me and he's going to bear my name and he's going to take it TO THE GENTILES. HE DIDN'T ASK SAUL IF HE WANTED TO GO TO the Gentiles. and he'll bear it before kings and to the nation of Israel. And and he never asked him. He never came AND SAID, "SALM, I I'VE GOT A DEAL FOR YOU. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHANGE YOUR WAYS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD? WHY DO YOU say we make a deal and you come to work for me?" And no, that was never in the equation. God had already determined it and already knew what it would BE AND SAID, "NOW I MUST SHOW HIM WHAT GREAT things he must suffer for my name's sake." Yeah. &gt;&gt; EVEN THE THINGS THAT SAUL WOULD SUFFER WITH. AMEN. GOD HAD ALREADY LAID HIM OUT AND adorned him and he PICKED HIM. AMEN. AND THE CHOOSING OF GOD. AMEN. BROUGHT PAUL INTO GENTILES whether he wanted it or not. &gt;&gt; Brought him unto kings, brought him into the Israel to bear the name of the Lord. The same one that he was persecuting. Now he would bear his name and he would suffer greatly for his name's sake. My oh my, God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose him to carry the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask him to carry the message. He chose him to carry the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Galatians, Paul says,"For you have heard of my conversion in time past in the Jews religion. How that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers." But when I I'm going to take a look at this here, but when it pleased God, Look at this word when &gt;&gt; that means time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the appointed time. &gt;&gt; When God decided. &gt;&gt; When it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that means God birthed Saul onto the earth at an appointed time. &gt;&gt; Because he SAYS IT WAS GOD WHO SEPARATED me from my God saw after my birth just like he did Jeremiah's. &gt;&gt; And when God separated me from my brother, my mother's womb, it was God who did this. Amen. God appointed my time. Uh God watched over my goings. Amen. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles. So when it pleased God to reveal his son in me, Amen. That's when he called me. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, LISTEN, GOD knew the day Saul was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew him when he was conceived. God knew when he was born. He foresaw his life. Amen. And he knew and separated him. And he knew when he was in the school of Galia. And he knew all that he was doing. And he knew when he was wreaking havoc in the churches. And he knew when he was hailing them to prison. And he knew he knew then what he would do. Amen. But he was waiting for the appointed time. And when it pleased God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD WHO SEPARATED me from my mother's womb, but it pleased him to reveal his son in me. Amen. Then then he called me by his grace and he began to to use me and anoint me. God was in control. Amen. God met Saul on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saul didn't find God. God found Saul. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't looking He wasn't looking for God in that way. He wasn't expecting to find him. Amen. He didn't want him to be Amen. the the He didn't want Jesus Christ to be God. He didn't want him to be the one he was persecuting. He didn't want any of that. Amen. But when God determined that it was now time, when it pleased God, God interrupted his plans and he met a pillar of fire on the road to Damascus, who began to tell him, "Amen, you're going the wrong direction. I've got another plan for you." And he sent Ananas to tell him, "Hey, you're a chosen vessel unto God, and you're going to go to the Gentiles and bear his name, and you're going to go to kings and bear his name, and you're going to go to Israel and bear his name. AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER GREATLY for his name's sake. And God never asked him if he wanted to. &gt;&gt; He just told him that's what he would do. &gt;&gt; Listen, we know, brother Bam tells us that God is a gentleman. He never forces anybody. So Saul had to surrender. He had to submit. Amen. But it wasn't his plan. It was God's plan. No matter how much he would have wanted to do a god a service and it's evident that he wanted to do god a service he was more zealous than all of his brethren for the father's traditions he had a zealousness inside of him and no doubt he was sincere and had a desire TO DO FOR GOD because he was upholding the traditions of the fathers which he thought was right and he was destroying anything that came against it and he wanted to do God a service but he was going about it completely wrong because he was doing it his way &gt;&gt; of his own mind, of his own will, of his own desire. And God let him go so long in his own knowledge and his own wisdom and his own ability. Amen. And and maybe God let HIM GO THAT FAR so that when God turned him around, he would realize what a wreck he is and how off he is and how he doesn't know anything. BUT WHEN GOD APPOINTED THE TIME when it pleased him, amen, to reveal his son in me, then he called me by his grace. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, so now the God being a gentleman, he never would force uh uh Saul to do this, but he would tell Saul, "This is what I have for you." And Saul would have to surrender to it. But no, no matter how zealous Saul was for a work of God, he could never put himself in this position. It was God who called him. &gt;&gt; It was God's decision. Listen, there's many decisions. Brother Vam said that we all are under a law of free choice. We're all under a law of choosing. We can all choose and we have a right to choose. And God gives us free moral agency. We choose. And that law of choosing sets within us a law of cause and effect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Choice and consequence. Which is part of our training in this life. &gt;&gt; God lets us make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; How many of you ever cried out to God, "God, why didn't you stop me? &gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED ME. WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME? I mean, I wonder if Saul ever wondered why God didn't come to him before the stoning of Steven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; God chose when to come to Saul. He could have come earlier and stopped all of that. And brother Brandham said it always bothered Paul &gt;&gt; about Stephen and he wanted to die a martyr's death to kind of make up for it. &gt;&gt; It was always on his subconscious. It always bothered him what he had done before and his persecution of the church. Amen. And God could have stopped him earlier. Amen. Because it was God's will and God's appointed time. Amen. But it served a purpose. &gt;&gt; So no matter how much he wanted, he couldn't be in that position by wanting to. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be in the position to bear his name to Gentiles and to kings and to Israel. He couldn't do that just because he wanted to or he desired it or he had a strong desire or something. That wouldn't do it. It had to be God's choice. Right? &gt;&gt; So, we can choose many things and those choices God allows us to make for good and for bad. And all of it's for lessons for us, but one thing we cannot choose is whether or not we're children of God. &gt;&gt; He chose that before. &gt;&gt; And what purpose we'd serve on this earth, he chose that before. We didn't choose that. A lot of choices he allows us to make, but that's one choice that we don't choose. He chose. &gt;&gt; Paul also says here in first Corinthians, "For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God, but by the grace of God, I am what I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See this word grace? &gt;&gt; That's God's love and favor. &gt;&gt; That's his choice. &gt;&gt; That's his desire, his plan. That's God's grace. but by the grace of God. So he says I'm not meat. That word meat means worthy. Said I am not I am not worthy to be an apostle. It's not merit. It's not worthiness. It's not ability. It was the grace of God. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. But I labored more abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. I think Paul learned something through his disastrous first part of his of his zeal for God. He realized that this isn't me. When it was me, it was all wrong. Now it's got to be him and me if it's going to be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO NOW PAUL now he realizes he's an apostle. And he realizes he's an apostle to the Gentiles. And he knows that he's here to fulfill the scripture because he knows there's a prophecy that he's fulfilling on Isaiah Isaiah that he is a light unto the Gentiles. He says so. &gt;&gt; So he knows he's the word. He knows he's the fulfillment of the word. He's a He's fulfilling a role that God gave him. He is a light to the Gentiles. He's bearing God's name. He's a chosen vessel. He's all of this, but he knows it has nothing to do with him. Has everything to do with God. So there's no pumping his chest. There's no pride. He's realizing I'm not even worthy to be what I am, but I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it's then even in my abundant labor, it's not I, it's the grace that's in me. &gt;&gt; So, I think he realized that this was all God. &gt;&gt; In 1st Samuel 16, we're going to jump around the Bible a little bit, so just hold on. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said to Samuel, "How long wil thou mourn for Saul?" Saul was the first king of Israel and Saul Samuel had anointed him king and he has failed to obey the voice of God. Said, "How long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill thine horn with oil and go. I will send thee the Jess to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I have provided me a king." Amen. &gt;&gt; I have provided me a king among his sons. &gt;&gt; What did David have to do with this at this part of the story? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; He was a lad out tending sheep. He was probably playing a harp when God was talking to Sam. He's probably playing a harp, singing and picking clover and and looking for a good place to pasture the sheep. He wasn't thinking about being a king. He wasn't desiring to be a king. He wasn't dreaming about being a king. HE WASN'T PRE PRE PLAYING PRETEND to be a king. He was out doing HIS THING. BUT GOD had provided uh he says, "I have provided me a king." GOD SAYS, "I PICKED one out." &gt;&gt; Had nothing to do with David. David was chosen of God. And at this stage uh of the story, HE DIDN'T SAY, "SAMUEL, I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO GO ASK David if you'd like to be a king for me." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's some things that he has to do himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Then he goes to Samuel's house. And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are here all thy children?" And he said, "There remainth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep." And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither." And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, "Arise, anoint him, for this is he." Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. Listen, David, they go and fetch David. David, who knows if he has a clue what's going on because he's been out tending the sheep. When when Samuel comes and tells his Aaron to Jesse that I'm going to anoint one of your sons king, he doesn't even think to go get David. He leaves David back out wherever he is in pasture tending sheep. And he brings the strongest all the way down through the through the first seven sons. And he brings them all down through there. And and and and the first one that came was Ilab. and he was broad shouldered and strong and he looked like a king. Amen. Samuel jumped up with the anointing oil and he was going to run over and said, "Surely this is God's choice." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God says, "No, you're looking wrong. You're looking like a man. You're looking to the outside. You're not looking at what I look at." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AND SO HE SAT DOWN AND one by one they're all rejected and he's he's like, "Well, &gt;&gt; is there another one?" SO THEY GO FETCH HIM AND THE GUY WHO WENT TO TO FETCH THE SERVANT WHO WENT to go fetch uh David, who knows what he told him, BUT DAVID IS OUT TENDING SHEEP. MAYBE DAVID had to run to the house. You know, they need you quick, Samuel, but the prophet's there. And he's wondering, am I in trouble? What have I done? I Why is Samuel the prophet there? My dad wants me to come. &gt;&gt; He's not thinking about being a king. &gt;&gt; He runs in there and stands. And as soon as he comes in the room, Samuel rises with a horn of oil cuz God says that's him. And all of a sudden, he begins to pour oil over his head and anoint him to be the next king. Amen. And then when he anoints him, then the spirit of God comes and rests upon him and he has this experience and now he's anointed. And now he he's he's got the spirit of God upon him. Amen. And he didn't do anything. All he did was walk in the room &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS GOD'S CHOICE. IT WAS GOD'S DECISION. IT WAS ALL GOD. IT WASN'T DAVID. IT WAS GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you know, FROM THAT POINT ON, DAVID'S life changes. &gt;&gt; I mean, immediately he goes back out and tends sheep. &gt;&gt; But somewhere along the line, he kills a bear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he kills a lion. &gt;&gt; And then he takes cheese and bread to to the armies of Israel when they're fighting the Philistines at the bidding of his father. and and he goes to check and see how it's going and and Goliath stands up and makes his boast and and David says, "Why isn't anybody killing this guy?" &gt;&gt; And it all GETS UP TO SAUL AND HE COMES TO SAUL. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO DAVID? LISTEN, DAVID'S NOT LOOKING TO BE A WARRIOR. DAVID'S NOT LISTEN WHEN A when a lamb when when his lamb was taken by a lion, HE WASN'T SAYING, "GOD, UH, MAKE ME A LION KILLER." God just made the circumstance HAPPEN. AMEN. BUT HE WAS UNDER an anointing and he was under the spirit OF GOD. AMEN. AND GOD WAS TRAINING HIM FOR A ROLE. AND WHATEVER HAPPENED, AMEN. the anointing and the spirit of God was moving him and he slew the lion and he slew the bear. And now he comes and there's a there's an anointing on him from the prophet. And there's a THERE'S A SPIRITUAL POWER THAT'S RESTING UPON HIM that when HE HEARS GOLIATH BOAST, THERE'S NO FEAR INSIDE HIM. EVERYBODY ELSE IS TREMBLING TILL THEIR KNEES KNOCK TOGETHER, till their bones are moving OUT OF JOINT. AMEN. BUT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT IN HIM. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE DAVID'S A BETTER MAN. It's because David WAS CHOSEN OF GOD, ANOINTED BY THE PROPHET, AND has the spirit of God resting upon him. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD DID NOT LEAVE IT TO DAVID TO DO HIMSELF. AMEN. HE SENT THE ANOINTING OF A PROPHET UPON HIM. AND HE SENT THE POWER OF HIS SPIRIT UPON HIM TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE ANOINTED HIM TO DO. AND GOD HAS NOT ASKED US TO GO OUT, AMEN, AND BE WHATEVER IN OUR OWN strength we need to be for THIS MESSAGE, BUT WE'RE UNDER THE ANOINTING OF A PROPHET. AND THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS BEEN POURED OUT WITH THIS WORD, AMEN, TO GIVE US THE ANOINTING AND THE POWER TO FACE EVERY DEVIL, TO FACE EVERY GIANT, TO FACE every lion and bear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT US, BUT IT'S GOD'S CHOICE IN US AND THE EQUIPPING THAT HE EQUIPS UNDER THE ANOINTING and the power to do his work. Amen. It wasn't David. It was God's choice and God's will and God's power and God's anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said it wasn't even David that killed Goliath. He said it was the spirit of God who caught that stone &gt;&gt; when it left the sling and guided it to the one spot in his armor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was David. David was God's choice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God was beginning to display him his choice to all of Israel. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not not because of David, but because of God. &gt;&gt; So he kills Goliath and then he gets a commission in the army and and he begins to slay thousands and ten thousands and then then people begin to write songs that the the the ladies begin to sing. Saul has killed his thousands, but David has killed his 10,000. And then David wasn't killing 10,000 by the strength of his arm. He was under an anointing &gt;&gt; and under the power of God. And he was a king already anointed to be king. And that was what was moving in his life. And the anointing of God in his life gets him in trouble with Saul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And David didn't want trouble with Saul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T WANT ANY PROBLEMS. HE TRIED TO AMEND THEM. HE TRIED for peace. He tried everything he could. Amen. AND IT WASN'T DAVID'S FAULT. IT WAS THE ANOINTING HE WAS UNDER. AND IT WAS THE POWER that rested upon him. HE WASN'T TRYING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS, &gt;&gt; but the anointing he WAS UNDER WAS CAUSING PROBLEMS. WHY? BECAUSE GOD TOLD SAMUEL, "ANOINT HIM when he walked into the room without him having anything to do WITH IT." AMEN. GOD SAID, "ANNOINT HIM." And under that anointing came a power. AND UNDER THAT ANOINTING AND POWER, HE WAS ALREADY ACTING LIKE A king and destroying the enemies of Israel. And and they were singing songs of HIS PRAISES. AND SAUL WAS GETTING JEALOUS. AND NOW SAUL WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM. And this ANOINTING AND THIS POWER BEGAN TO CAUSE HIM ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; Just like Paul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show him great things he must suffer. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; As soon as as soon Amen. as as as Ananas comes in and lays hands on on Saul. AMEN. AND AND SAUL NOW GETS UP AND IS baptized and he's filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately he goes into Damascus and he goes into the synagogue and he starts preaching Christ and proving to them from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. &gt;&gt; Immediately. &gt;&gt; And then what do they do? The Jews sought to kill him. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED? OH, HE WAS JUST GOING ALONG DOING HIS THING. AND GOD interrupted his plan. God came in and changed his perspective, CHANGED HIS PLAN. AND GOD, AMEN, COME AND OPENED HIS EYES TO ANANAS. And God told him, "You're my chosen vessel. You'll do this." AND THEN GOD FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT. AND GOD GAVE HIM REVELATION of the word. And all he does is go out under the anointing to preach the revelation of the word. And all of the trouble starts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, David is running from cave to cave to cave cuz Saul hates him. And all of a sudden, HIS LIFE IS DIFFICULT AND HE'S GOT ALL KINDS OF TROUBLES AND AND and we see the life of David. All kinds of problems. &gt;&gt; And David never asked to be a king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God told him he was. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I love this so much. God is so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Exodus, this is a story of Moses. Moses, we know what Moses tried to do. I'm going to use the black screen of power. We we know that Moses was born a proper child and he was born to be a deliverer. And brother Ben tells us the stories how his mother jockabed used to take him on his knee and tell him, "You were born to be a deliverer and this is the promise to the children of Abraham and and you were born under a sign and this and that." Amen. And finally, he comes of age and he goes to visit his brethren and he's got all of this in his mind. Amen. And and he's an Egyptian trained in warfare, trained in arts, trained in science, and he's got it all figured out. And all of a sudden, he sees an Egyptian smiting one of his brethren, the Hebrews. And he says he is so uh so educated into being a deliverer, he thinks, well, I'm a deliverer. But look at what he says when he saw the Egyptians smiling in Hebrew. He says he looked this way and that way to see if anybody was looking. &gt;&gt; This isn't a godly anointing, friends. That's human. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you stand up to declare amen, the gospel and you look around to see which the co-workers are listening. Listen, that's not a godly anointing. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not the godly anointing. He looks this way and that way and he smites the Egyptian and kills the Egyptian and hides him in the sand. &gt;&gt; This is all human effort to serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we know the next day he goes out and he finds the two Hebrews, amen, fighting one another, one smoke the other, and he goes to correct him and he says, "Who who made you ruler over us? Are you going to kill me as you did the Egyptian?" and he ran away and Pharaoh heard about it and wanted to kill him and he ran off and he got married and now he's working for his father-in-law and he he's tending the sheep the the the the as a herdsman and and he's out we he has this meeting at the burning bush and that's where we're we're at now. Exodus 3 says now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel's come up unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee into Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses didn't make this happen. &gt;&gt; God did. &gt;&gt; Moses may have had an idea of who he was given to him by his mom, and he may have had an intellectual conception and a theological understanding of a deliverer. Amen. But when he went out humanistically before God's time, in his own time, &gt;&gt; he failed. &gt;&gt; But now God come to him in a burning bush. It wasn't Moses who made the burn the bush burn with fire but not be consumed. &gt;&gt; It was God who worked the miracle to get Moses' attention because now when it pleased God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And now was the time it pleased God. And now Moses goes to the burning bush to see what this phenomenon is. And a voice speaks out to him. And now God begins to tell him, "All right, Moses. This is what your mama told you. Now I've heard the cry. Now I'm going to send you. Now I go on now. I will send thee into Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." And this is Moses' response. And Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" And he said, "Certainly, I will be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt. You shall serve God upon this mountain." Moses first response is, "I'm not good enough. Who Who am I that I should go into Pharaoh? Don't you know I'm already rejected? Don't you know I've already failed failed? Don't you know I'm back here? I'm a nobody. I'm a hasb been. I'm washed up. I'm on the back side of a desert. I'm working for my father-in-law. I I I'm nothing. And he says, "Who who am I that I should go into Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" Moses still has the wrong idea of what God is looking for. Because before in his strength and in his power and in his humanistic ideas, he slew an Egyptian. He started to work to work. But that wasn't God's way and that wasn't God's time. And now he has no more power. He has no more strength. He has no more armies. He has no more political anything. He's down nothing. And he thinks, "Who am I? I can't do this." and he's got the wrong idea of what God wants. &gt;&gt; God wants a vessel. That's all he wants. &gt;&gt; He just wants a vessel, a predestinated vessel that he can use. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we start thinking, Amen. There's two ways to think. We can either think, I see all these skills in me. I can do this and I can do this and I can do this. God must want to use me for this. &gt;&gt; That's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wrong. But the other way of looking at it is I can't do this and I can't do this and I can't do this. God must not want to use me. &gt;&gt; Both are wrong. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW ABOUT LETTING GOD JUST DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH your life? Whether you can or can't, whether you got it or don't got it, God can supply an anointing and God can supply his spirit and God can bring to pass whatever he wants to bring to pass. It's not us FOR US TO DECIDE I can or I can't. I can do it. I can't do it. I've got it. I don't got it. It's for us to stand still and let God manifest whatever he predestinated our purpose in this life to be. BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A PURPOSE IN YOU, HE CAN TAKE THE SMALLEST of the brothers h sons of Jesse and he can MAKE HIM KILL A GIANT. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN DO THAT. GOD CAN TAKE THE SMALLEST IN THE STATURE AND SLAY A BEAR AND SLAY a lion because he can put an anointing ON HIM FROM A PROPHET AND SEND THE POWER OF HIS SPIRIT UPON HIM and he CAN ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER HE WANTS to accomplish with you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not here to find out what we're good at. We're here to find out who we are &gt;&gt; and and what God wants TO DO WITH OUR LIFE AND JUST surrendered to him and let him do it. &gt;&gt; And here he comes TO MOSES. MOSES THOUGHT he had messed up. Got read the wrong signs. His mom misunderstood the sign that was over. I'm not the deliverer. Now God comes and says, "You are the deliverer." But he he'd failed so much and he got so low of himself. Amen. Living with a hot-tempered wife on the back side of the desert had really worked him over. I guess he said, "Who am I? Who am I?" I mean, I could imagine now God didn't say this, but I could imagine saying God saying, "Moses, who am I?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. forget about who you are. WHO'S TALKING TO YOU, MOSES? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is the problem with Moses. Now, he says, "And Moses said unto God, behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your father sent me." Now, this is this is just logic and reasoning, but I want to skip back to what God just said. God said, "Certainly, I will be with thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; What more do you need? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. &gt;&gt; Certainly, I will be with thee. &gt;&gt; End of discussion. That's all I need. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's it. If you'll be with me, if God's with you, you're in the majority. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Certainly, I'll be with thee. You don't need any more discussion. But he's still troubled in his mind. And he gives him a token and evidence and says, "Surely, this will be the token. You're going to come back TO THIS MOUNTAIN AFTER YOU DELIVER them out of Egypt and you're going to worship me on this mountain. That's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Moses says, "But but they're not going to believe me. When I come unto the children of Israel, and I shall say unto them, the God of your fathers has sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, what is his name?" Listen, what is he talking about? GOD JUST SAID, "I'M SENDING YOU. I will be with you." And I promise you, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A token of what I said you'd be truth because you're coming back to worship on this mountain. And Moses is worried about if they're going to believe him or not when he says, "I talked to God and they're going to say, what's his name?" WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? GOD JUST SAID, "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND YOU'RE COMING back to THIS MOUNTAIN WHEN YOU BRING THEM OUT OF EGYPT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is the problem with human thinking. This is the way our human brains operate. We can all we see is hindrances. All we see is inability. All we see is impossibilities. AMEN. BUT FAITH HAS to look beyond human reasoning and the human mind and said, "If you'll be with me now, more than enough." &gt;&gt; Amen. They say, "What is his name? What shall I say unto them?" And God said unto Moses, "I am that I am." He said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am has sent me unto you." Okay. Chapter 4:1. And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, "The Lord hath not appeared unto thee." And the Lord said unto him, "What is that in thy hand?" He said, "A rod." Said, "Cast it on the ground." And he cast it on the ground, and he became a serpent. Moses fled from it. And this is where he says, "I'll give you two signs. I'll give you this sign. I'll give you a sign in the hand where you put your hand in your bosom, pull out leprosy, and do it again. It comes out white and clean." And and so, okay, we dealt with this one. Then he says, "And Moses said unto the Lord, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither hereto for nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant, but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue." And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind? Have not I the Lord? Now therefore go, I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh my Lord, send I pray thee by the hand of him who thou will send." Says, "God, please send somebody else." &gt;&gt; My goodness. Have you ever felt like this? When you look in the mirror, when you look at yourself, when you think, listen, we may not have this kind of dialogue with God, but this is exactly the way that our human minds work. &gt;&gt; But not me. But I can't be one of them, but it can't be me. How could I be the bride? But I make so many mistakes, but I but I've done this, but you don't know my past, but I can't. It says, "And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses." And he said, "Is not Aaron Levite, Aaron the Levite, thy brother? I know that he can speak well, and also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart, and thou shalt speak unto him, and put his word, put words in his mouth, and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do." This this dialogue with God and Moses to me is so astounding in the scriptures that God comes down and says, "Listen, now's the time. The prophecy fulfilled. I'm going down and I'm sending you." And Moses says, "No, I it won't work." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he says, "But I'll be with you and you're going to come back here." But but they won't listen to me. And if they ask me who talk to me, what am I going to tell them? &gt;&gt; Well, just tell them I am sent you. But they won't believe me. They won't listen to me. They won't believe that you appeared to me. Okay. What's in your hand? A rod. Okay. Throw it down. It's a servant. Take it up. It's a stick. All right. Do look at these two signs. They'll believe the signs. The voice of the signs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm not eloquent of speech, but how many excuses can one person come up with when they're talking to God? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why not just say, "I'm not worthy to be nothing." That's a double negative, &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, if that's what you want me to do, if that's what you want me to be, I'll go. I have no idea how I'm going to do it. I've got no idea. I got a million questions. It looks like it's impossible, but if you'll be with me, if you've made the promise, it'll work. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message expectation he said testifying when he come he said I am sent from the presence of God to tell you your birth in life is to indicate that you are take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world. This is when the angel visited brother Brandham to give him his commission and be to tell me different things would happen. I told him that I was uneducated and wasn't able to go. He told me I'd be given two signs. It said the people will not believe. I said, "The people will not believe me because I'm not educated sufficient to speak to people." He said, "You'll be given two signs as was the prophet Moses." He said, "One sign will be that you'll detect diseases through your hand. When the people contact you, well, you'll be able to tell them what diseases they have through a supernatural discernment." and then said, "If you'll be sincere, then it will come to pass that you'll tell the people the secrets of their hearts and the things that they've done in life that might have hindered their healing and so forth." And I said, "I I'm well, they'll they will not believe me." He said, "I will be with you." I said, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many of you are glad he said, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that he was able. Not that he had skills, not that he had the abilities to do anything. But God says, "I I I've come with a commission." And listen, the angel says, "I've come from the presence of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he come from the presence OF THE LORD TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE and what your purpose is and to give you your commission from God Almighty, THEN MY IF THAT'S WHAT GOD SAYS I AM, THEN THAT'S what I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT'S WHAT GOD SAYS I'M TO DO, THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW. AND BROTHER BENHAM HIMSELF HAD QUESTIONS. I'M NOT ELOQUENT. I I CAN'T SPEAK. I'M not educated. They don't They won't believe me. Amen. But the angel said, "You'll be given two signs." Like Moses was given two signs. Amen. And here's what the signs will be. And And Brother BAM AGAIN SAYS, "BUT I'M NOT EDUCATED. They're not going to believe me." But he says, "I will be with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all I need. If you GO WITH ME, I'LL GO. &gt;&gt; OH, I'm so glad we had a prophet in this day. Amen. With a seventh grade education, couldn't read the big words in the Bible. Amen. Was intimidated. Amen. To begin with in the ministry. But, but because he was sent, Amen. an angel from the presence of the Lord gave him a message from God and promised to be with him. He went and he went listen when brother Brandham went he didn't know how he was going to pray for kings and potentates and and he was going to travel around the world even his pastor told him said how are you with a seventh grade education going to go to places like that and talk to those kind of people and brother SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT HE SAID IT and I believe it &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going TO DO IT BROTHER didn't have it figured out he he had maybe as many questions and doubts as Moses had about himself but he knew one saying that THIS MESSAGE I GOT COME from the presence OF GOD AND THAT ANGEL PROMISED HE WOULD BE WITH ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you're going to pray for kings and potentates and and you're going to travel the world. And this was a man who had hardly left uh uh hardly left Indiana except one stent when he when he went to Arizona. Amen. And he worked for a while in a ranch and then came back after his brother died. Listen, he he traveled the world. He had no money. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh uh uh pray for kings and potentates and ALL OF THESE PEOPLE. LISTEN, he had a seventh grade education. And when he first went out, Amen. He didn't even have a A PROPER SUIT IN HIS COAT. HE had to mend by himself. And listen, and that's why he began to shake people's left hand because he would cover. I mean, the patch job HE DID ON HIS POCKET and his coat with his right hand. He wasn't even DRESSED RIGHT, COULDN'T TALK RIGHT, DIDN'T HAVE EDUCATION, DIDN'T KNOW how to conduct meetings, didn't know how to handle finances, didn't know how to rent facilities, didn't know how to do anything, but he just went. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE GOD CALLED HIM, GOD PROTECTED HIM, GOD ANOINTED HIM, GOD EMPOWERED HIM, AND GOD OPENED ALL THE DOORS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He didn't HAVE TO HAVE IT FIGURED OUT BEFORE. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS GO. LISTEN, and you don't have to figure ANYTHING OUT. WHATEVER GOD'S CALLED YOU TO DO IN THIS LIFE, HE CAN DO THROUGH YOU. HE'LL OPEN THE DOORS. HE'LL CLOSE THE DOORS. HE'LL EDUCATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have accepted little little Jesse's little son, David, as their king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So God made sure there was a big old giant show up one day to scare them all to death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Till their bones were rattling inside and their knees were sming together. AMEN. AND THEY WERE ALL TERRIFIED. AMEN. FROM SAUL ALL THE WAY THROUGH. EVEN ILAB, the big brother who looked like a king WITH BROAD SHOULDERS, HE WAS SCARED HIDING IN THE TENT. WHEN LITTLE DAVID showed up WITH A LITTLE CART FULL OF CHEESE AND BREAD and wine. Amen. AND HE STARTS SAYING, "WHY ARE YOU GUYS SCARED OF DEATH? WHY DON'T SOMEBODY GO AND KILL HIM, KILL HIM?" &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHY HAS HE LIVED THIS LONG? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING? AMEN. GOLIATH WAS SERVING GOD'S PURPOSE IN DAVID. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. David didn't know how God was going to make him a king. David didn't know what GOD WOULD DO. BUT GOD KNEW WHAT HE WOULD DO. AND GOD KNEW HOW to accomplish it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't know HOW TO GO OUT and start a worldwide healing campaign. HE HAD NO IDEA. AMEN. IT STARTED WITH ONE PERSON WITH A NEED. AND IT STARTED BY GOING TO A HOSPITAL. THEN IT STARTED BY a news article. And that news article went to somebody else. AND HE GOT CALLED OUT TO ILLINOIS or Indiana or wherever it was. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, one thing after another happened. HE WAS LED STEP BY STEP, BUT HE WAS anointed and he had the power of the HOLY GHOST AND GOD did it all. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Bam says this. Now, I want you to know this is sure know this is sure. And you that listen to this tape, you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message. I have no more to do with it than nothing. No more than just a voice. and my voice even against my better judgment. I wanted to be a trapper. But it's the will of my father that I declare to do and I determine and determined to do. &gt;&gt; Remember I said this wasn't my idea. I didn't decide to have a worldwide ministry. I didn't decide to have a mill healing ministry. I didn't decide to have have two gifts &gt;&gt; that would show themselves. I didn't decide to BE A PROPHET. I DIDN'T DECIDE ANY OF THAT. I WAS just I was just there. &gt;&gt; He decided against my decision &gt;&gt; against my better judgment, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad God picks. &gt;&gt; I would have made myself something. I don't know what I would have been. Amen. But I'm so glad God picks. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God picks and God ordains and God sends, then God must make a way. &gt;&gt; God must provide. God must protect. God must defend. God must demonstrate. God must show his power. &gt;&gt; If we send ourselves, Amen. We'll go like Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is anybody looking? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Kill one Egyptian and hide him under the sand. That was the great deliverer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That was a man trying to be something before his time, &gt;&gt; of his own efforts. &gt;&gt; Then when the other one challenged him, he runs away scared. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we go ourselves in our own time and our own calling, that's how it'll be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we wait on God when it pleased God, &gt;&gt; then God has to make all the provisions for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. in Acts chapter 13. Turn there with with me. Acts 13:46. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you. But seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation and to the ends of the earth. That's a prophecy out of Isaiah. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; Huh? Which came first, believing or being ordained? &gt;&gt; Appointed, &gt;&gt; chosen. &gt;&gt; Why did they believe? Because they were already ordained to eternal life &gt;&gt; by the predestination of God. &gt;&gt; They were ordained to believe. &gt;&gt; They were believers because they were predestinated to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't because these Gentiles happened to be smarter than the Jews that were in that city. &gt;&gt; It was because they were ordained unto eternal life. They were predestinated. They were chosen of God, they were positioned for eternal life. And because of that, when the message came to them, they believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, when it says as many as were ordained to eternal life believed, that means God chose for them to believe. &gt;&gt; That means they believed because of God's choice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you mean God ordained them to believe? &gt;&gt; Yes. And if you ordained them to believe, then did he ordain us to believe? &gt;&gt; And if he ordained us to believe, then we've been ordained into eternal life. We've been predestinated. And God has positionally placed us as believers. We're not believers just because we want to be believers. &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to be a believer. &gt;&gt; I mean, I want to be, but but my wanting to be cannot change God's eternal purpose in his mind. AMEN. BUT GOD GOD CHOSE ME TO BE a believer. And that makes me a believer because he chose me to be a believer because by grace are we saved through faith and that not of ourselves. It is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ability to believe is a gift from God. AMEN. SO GOD ORDAINED US, AMEN, unto eternal life. And when we heard the message, we believe not because we were better than anybody else on this planet. Amen. Better skills or better abilities. Amen. But we believe because God ordained us to be believers in this age because that's our position. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO LOOK AT GOD AND SAY, "GOD, I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE, BUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT BUT GOD, WHAT ABOUT BUT GOD?" NO, THAT NOBODY WILL BELIEVE I'M A BELIEVER, BUT GOD, I'VE GOT ALL THESE PROBLEMS IN THE PAST, BUT GOD, I'VE GOT A BAD REPUTATION, BUT GOD, I'VE GOT THIS AND I'VE GOT THAT. LISTEN, BE QUIET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAYS YOU'RE A BELIEVER, YOU'RE A BELIEVER, and if you're a believer, and you believe this message, THEN YOU'RE PART OF HIS BRIDE. HE CHOSE THAT. YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So many people are still arguing with God. They believe. Listen, they they believe. Then they have all the questions like Moses had. &gt;&gt; Then they got all the TROUBLE WITH THEIR PAST LIKE SAUL HAD. THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE ISSUES. AMEN. And and they start thinking because of all THE ISSUES I I I can't be. I must not be. And then they end up being miserable. Miserable. Miserable. Saying I I must not be a real believer because because of this thing in my life or because this thing in my past because I can't this or because I can't that. I must not be a believer. But they're utterly miserable. &gt;&gt; And you know what makes them miserable? is because they believe the message. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; If they didn't believe the message, then they wouldn't mind not being a believer. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE TORMENTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE they're not a believer, proving they're a believer. They need to FORGET ABOUT THE TORMENT AND JUST BE A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; AND THANK GOD THAT YOU'VE BEEN ORDAINED INTO ETERNAL LIFE. THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THE MESSAGE, YOU BELIEVE. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BELIEVE. GOD HAD TO CHOOSE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD OR YOU WOULD WALK AWAY &gt;&gt; LIKE MILLIONS HAVE WALKED AWAY. LISTEN, HOW FEW PEOPLE on this planet have actually heard the message? &gt;&gt; You did. &gt;&gt; Out of all the people THAT HEARD THE MESSAGE, HOW MANY BELIEVE the message? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; YOU DID. &gt;&gt; WHY STAY IN MISERY TRYING TO CONVINCE GOD YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER AND CONVINCE YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER? And you're miserable being a not a believer believer. Listen, people who AREN'T REALLY BELIEVERS, THEY'RE FINE JUST MOVING ON AND FINDING SOMETHING ELSE IN LIFE TO DO. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the people who believe the message, WHO DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; To be a believer that are miserable human beings because they won't JUST ACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS MADE THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, AND IF GOD HAS MADE YOU THAT, &gt;&gt; then God's got to clean you up, fix you, equip you, ordain you, bring you out of your slumps, help you OVERCOME YOUR COMPLEXES. YEAH. WHAT CAN WE DO? AMEN. WE NEVER MADE OURSELVES GOOD ENOUGH. WE WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. BUT HE CHOSE US. IF HE CHOSE US, HE'S GOT TO DO THE WORK LIKE HE DID FOR MOSES, LIKE HE DID FOR PAUL, LIKE HE DID FOR DAVID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We just got to accept what he says. &gt;&gt; Go to Acts chapter 8. No, no, I'm not going to go there. I'm going skip that. Seventh seal. As they were a remnant according to election, these Jews are now. He's speaking of the tribulation period. The remnant according to election in the days of Elijah's first ministry to the Jews where 7,000 believers were kept away by the hand of God. Now there is in this remnant time coming in their time to be 144,000 according to the election that the message at that time to to believe the message will be 144,000. Listen in the days of Elijah Elijah thought he was the only one when he was back in the cave and God says no I have reserved this is what he says in the book of Romans. He says, "I have reserved to myself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 7,000 that have not bowed the knee. Those 7,000 men didn't reserve themselves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Weren't better Israelites. &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "I RESERVE TO myself &gt;&gt; 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee." &gt;&gt; Why were there 7,000 that didn't bow the knee? because God determined that there'd be 7,000 who didn't bow their knee. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't fall by the same deception. And then what's funny too is he tells Elijah, "Hey, listen Elijah. I got three things for you to do. I want you to anoint Joo. I want you to anoint this one king over Syria. And I want you to anoint Elisha to be prophet in yourstead." Then he goes off from Mount Horeb. And he goes along and here's Elisha. You know what Elisha's doing? He's being a good boy &gt;&gt; working for dad &gt;&gt; and he's plowing behind 12 a team of 12 oxen and he's by the 12 and he's just being a good boy working his dad's farm doing what he was told to do. I wonder what Elisha was thinking about that day. Man, these ox are slow. It's going to be all it's going to be late in the afternoon before I get this job done. and all my friends will this and the servants are this and I probably missed lunch or whatever he was thinking about. &gt;&gt; He might have been thinking about how good the soil smells when it turns over. He might have been watching the the the the hooves of the oxen as they clop along. They go down one long row and then he turns them around positions and they go down another row. He's just doing his daily routine and all of a sudden the prophet Elijah comes by, takes off his mantle and throws it over his shoulders &gt;&gt; and from that moment his whole life changes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did Elijah have to what did Elisha have to do with that? Nothing. &gt;&gt; That was God's choice. &gt;&gt; The 7,000 were God's choice. &gt;&gt; And now in the seventh seal, Brother Benham's telling us the elected will come out and the tribulation period. God will call his elected. And that is the Jews during that time. The elected. The Bible speaks of it. Paul speaks of it. According to the election, there will be 144,000 according to the election. There's a reason I'm reading this over and over that will believe the message out of literally millions that will be there over in Israel right now. I think there's somewhere between 6 and 7,000 million or six and 7 million, sorry, 6 and 7 million Jews &gt;&gt; in Palestine. &gt;&gt; How many are going to believe the message of the two witnesses? How many will believe? &gt;&gt; You passed the test. &gt;&gt; So, is God waiting to see how many of 7 million will believe? &gt;&gt; Is God waiting for good people to decide that this sounds like a good message? &gt;&gt; What message are the 144,000 going to receive? They're going to seem the receive the same message you're hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Brother Bam said. So, they'll receive the same message you're hearing tonight. Amen. And they're going to receive it through two prophets, Moses and Elijah. It'll be in two men there that'll be preaching the gospel. And they'll be preaching it with signs following. And out of millions, God is not waiting to see who's who. Cuz he said there's going to be 144,000. And better than that, he said there's GOING TO BE 12,000 OUT OF EACH TRIBE. HE HAS ALREADY DETERMINED who will believe the message. &gt;&gt; God's not waiting to find out. Amen. Brother Brenham made this statement over and over. I just got one quote here where he says, "This is in the hidden life with Christ. So you see the argument of that just doesn't stand. But we're not arguing. We're preaching the word. And God will have somebody that'll hear it and receive it. Those who Jesus died to hear the word, they'll hear it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you ever think of that? May I stop here just for a moment and realize I'm facing clergymen and smart men, but I'd just like to say this. Know that I believe this and I know it. Jesus never went to the cross and died for some haphazard affair. Right? &gt;&gt; Perhaps maybe somebody might feel sorry because he died and so they come to get saved. God doesn't run his business like that. God runs his business by fornowledge knowing before the world ever was formed who was his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were in God's fornowledge. We were saved before the foundation of the world. And Jesus came to die for those who God by fornowledge had elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was not waiting to see who would believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not waiting now to see who will believe. &gt;&gt; There'll be preaching. There'll be signs. But he already said there'll be 144,000 &gt;&gt; that believe. &gt;&gt; And there'll be 12,000 out of each tribe. &gt;&gt; He has already appointed it. He has already ordained it. And that's the way that it'll be. &gt;&gt; And I don't think any of those 144,000 are going to be able to beat their chest and say, "Haha, look at me." And listen, THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. GOD HAD ALREADY DETERMINED YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15, Jesus says, "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter didn't choose &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus chose Peter. &gt;&gt; Andrew, James, and John, and Bartholomew, and all of them, they were chosen by Jesus. in the church ages book in the Smirn age. This is what brother said. He goes through several scriptures. I'm going to read these together. John 6:37 and 44 says, "All that the father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I shall in no wise cast out. No man can come to me except the Father draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day." &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's already chose. &gt;&gt; John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor the will of flesh, nor the will of man, but of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 1:4, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will." Now, without getting too involved in the subject of sovereignty of God, for that would take a book in itself, let me point out here that according to these verses, Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today. The bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband. No sir, it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Now, according to the word of God, the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world. This choosing of the bride was purposed in himself. Ephesians 1:9. And in Romans 9:11, it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand. You can't read it any other way. The heart purpose, the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing. See all capitals. &gt;&gt; Who chose? &gt;&gt; Did you choose or did he choose? &gt;&gt; To take a bride of his own choosing. And that purpose was in himself. And being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. Listen, it's not that I chose, it's that he chose. &gt;&gt; God wasn't waiting to see what I would choose. He already chose me. It's my job to surrender to him &gt;&gt; to exercise free moral agency and surrender back to him. But he already chose &gt;&gt; again in the Sammy church. He is not the person that comes predestined eternally from God. It's the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for human mind to grasp. The eternal God with eternal thoughts thought and decreed. Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated. &gt;&gt; Amen. when and neither was born and neither had done good or evil. &gt;&gt; Why? That the purpose of election might stand. &gt;&gt; See, it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed. Jacob alone had the seed. That is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of God. If you are true seed, you will hear the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ, filling you and empowering you, and you will receive the word for your day and age. You will &gt;&gt; If you're a true seed, you will hear the word. &gt;&gt; Have you heard the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit will baptize you in the body of Christ, filling you and empowering you, and you will receive the word for your day and age. Why? Because you're seed. You're a thought. You're in THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD. YOU'RE predestinated to be part of his bride. He chose you and ordained you as PART OF HIS BRIDE. THAT'S why you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not waiting to see if you'll believe. He's not waiting to see if after you believe if you'll become a good boy or girl. He'll take care of all of that. What he's doing is he's waiting for us TO JUST SAY, "I BELIEVE. I WILL GO. &gt;&gt; I will go. IF YOU SAY YOU'LL BE WITH ME, I'LL GO. I'LL BE WHAT YOU'VE CALLED ME TO BE, BUT GOD, I'M GOING TO NEED your help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't do THIS BY MYSELF. I'M JUST AS BAD OFF AS MOSES WAS. I'm as bad off as brother Brandham was. I'm just as LITTLE ON THE BACKSIDE of the desert as David was. I'm just as evil and wretched and going the WRONG WAY AS SAUL IS. I'M LIKE ALL OF THEM. BUT IF YOU CAN do that for them by predestination, then you can do for me whatever you purposed for me to do. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER MY PURPOSE IS, you will MAKE A WAY. WHATEVER I need to do and accomplish for your word, say you'll accomplish IT IN ME BY THE anointing I'm under and by the power of your spirit. &gt;&gt; God will do it because it's his word. John 6:37, "And all that the Father giveth me shall come to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. This is the father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me. Is this word hath? &gt;&gt; I should I all that he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's taken care of it. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:9 says, "But ye are a chosen generation." Chosen. I love that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chosen. &gt;&gt; You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. I'd like to take a look at these two words, chosen generation, because you can look at it and misunderstand it. You can say, well, we're a chosen generation, which means that this is the generation, the end time, when God's going to do all the work. We're chosen to be in this generation. But that is not what this means. &gt;&gt; The word chosen means electtos. Sometimes you don't even have to speak Greek. &gt;&gt; It's the origin of our language of English, you know, through Greek to Latin and then and to English. And electtos means elect, chosen, picked out, chosen, chosen by God. So you're a chosen generation means you've been picked by God. You've been chosen. Electtos elected. &gt;&gt; Generation means genos. &gt;&gt; Which means race, offspring, family, &gt;&gt; children, stock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kind. &gt;&gt; You are the chosen family of God. &gt;&gt; You are electtos genos. You come from his gene. You come from him. You're his offspring. You're his children. I was telling brother Franco about this today. He says, "You need to make a t-shirt that says I'm Altos Genos. Somebody make it for me, please. That's going to be a good shirt. That'd be a hot seller." Amen. Electto Genos, you're a chosen generation. YOU'RE NOT JUST part of the end time thing. No, you're you're PART OF GOD'S FAMILY BY CHOICE. NOT YOUR CHOICE, his choice. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't choose to be a son OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. HE chooses who's his son and DAUGHTERS ARE. HE CHOSE YOU to be part of electtos go. &gt;&gt; He chose his own family. He chose his own bride. He chose his own offspring by by fornowledge by predestination through election. He has chosen you and I. Amen. And we're here. Amen. to respond to that choice and to surrender and yield our lives to him so that he can accomplish his purpose in our lives. If he chose us, he chose us for a purpose. That purpose he has the power to perform. Whatever he's called you to do in life, he'll give you the anointing and the power. And he's already anointed this bride under a prophetic anointing &gt;&gt; just like David. And he's already Amen. through the through the opening of the word, loose the Holy Ghost in full measure to come back in the church. So, she's already under the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All we have to do is just trust in him and believe what he said and move forward like Moses moves forward. Brother B said Moses went forward with a stick in his hand and a donkey and his kids and wife on the donkey and he said, "Where are you going, Moses? I'm going to take over Egypt. How you going to do it? I don't know, but God said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. What are you here to do? I'm here to manifest the very life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? I have no idea, but I believe. He told me. He called me. He's anointed me under this prophetic MESSAGE AND HE'S EMPOWERING MY SPIRIT AND WHATEVER. IF HE NEEDS TO BRING UP A GOLIATH TO PROVE HIMSELF, HE'LL BRING UP A GOLIATH and anoint me to take him out. &gt;&gt; But I can't do nothing. I feel like Moses. Most days we feel like Moses, &gt;&gt; BUT I CAN'T SPEAK. I'M NOT ELOQUENT. THEY won't believe me. But I can't do it. But I already tried. Listen, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU FEEL LIKE MOSES. You can feel like Moses every DAY OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. BUT THE TRICK IS NOT TO NOT TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN FEELING LIKE MOSES. But to get up and move by the word of GOD AND LET GOD make a way. Let his purpose and his choosing and his word produce the works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; MOVE FORWARD AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. MOVE FORWARD AS THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST in this age. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW. JUST BELIEVE HE WILL AND move forward. &gt;&gt; How are WE GOING TO DO IT? HOW IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN? I don't know how. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this scripture. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son &gt;&gt; that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. Whom he called, them he also justified. Whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God before us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; What have we to be afraid of? Amen. Let's all stand together. Musicians, if you'd come, please. Hey, listen. We don't have it figured out. &gt;&gt; He didn't expect us to have it figured out. &gt;&gt; We're not good enough. He never asked us to be good enough. &gt;&gt; But he chose us. &gt;&gt; He picked, he chose, he declared by his fornowledge. He chose &gt;&gt; and and he just needs a vessel. Saul was was Saul zealous but in the wrong direction but he says he's a chosen vessel unto me not doing what he's doing now but doing what I want him to do Jesse's son David was a chosen vessel Moses was a chosen vessel brother Brandham was a chosen vessel and guess what you're just as much a chosen vessel &gt;&gt; and none of these people could do it on their own none of these people can make themselves anything you can't make yourself anything &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; you can't by wanting to and trying to. You can't make yourself anything. What you are is determined by God. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't do us one ounce of good denying what we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Resisting and fighting against the word of God and trying to what I don't know what we're trying to do, prove something. All we're doing is making ourselves miserable. You you know when when Paul would look at somebody and says, "God is going to judge the world by my gospel." &gt;&gt; That wasn't pride. &gt;&gt; He wasn't being pompous. &gt;&gt; He wasn't being arrogant. He was telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he says, "I'm called to be a light unto the Gentiles." &gt;&gt; Man, that really sounds like &gt;&gt; you really think a lot of yourself, Paul. But Paul, Paul's not the one who came up with that plan. &gt;&gt; Paul's not the one who decided that. When David said, "God's anointed me to be a king." And you look at him, you little shrimp, you're a king. Haha. Listen, it wasn't David's idea. David wasn't doing anything wrong for David to say, "God's anointed me to be a king," is speaking the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; FOR FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL TO SAY, "GOD WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL. I'M A LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." God has called me, amen, to take the gospel to the Gentiles. HE'S NOT BRAGGING. HE'S NOT LIFTING HIMSELF UP. HE'S just telling the truth. &gt;&gt; AND GOD LET HIM FAIL SO MISERABLY AND SO BAD THAT WHEN it come time to declare he's apostle, an apostle of God, HE SAYS, "HEY, LISTEN. I'm not even worthy to be an apostle, but by the grace of God, I am what I am." &gt;&gt; When Moses says, "I've come down to deliver you out of Egypt. I'VE COME DOWN AND GOD HAS CALLED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK." AMEN. AND GOD IS GOING TO DO MIRACLES through me. Listen. Listen. And he wasn't bragging. He was only TELLING THE TRUTH. AND FOR US TO SAY, "I BELIEVE BY FAITH AND BY GRACE. I'M PART OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST." THAT'S NOTHING BUT DECLARING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we don't DO SO WITH PRIDE or arrogancy, but in humility, saying, "I MESSED MY LIFE UP. EVEN AFTER BELIEVING, I'VE MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'VE MESSED everything that can be MESSED UP HAS BEEN MESSED UP BY ME. &gt;&gt; But I still believe. &gt;&gt; I believe what he said about me. I believe what that prophet said about me. I believe the word. And why do I believe? Because I can't help but believe. &gt;&gt; I didn't believe BECAUSE I CHOSE TO BELIEVE. I JUST BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. IT WASN'T THAT YOU CALCULATED EVERYTHING OUT AND LAID IT ALL OUT and says, "hm, you know, the Baptists say this and the Pentecostals and but I've been reading my Bible and I talked to a few theologians and listen, I put together a flowchart AND THE MOST REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE GOSPEL IS BROTHER BEN. SO, I DECIDED TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." THAT IS NOT HOW WE COME TO THE MESSAGE. WE COME TO THE MESSAGE BEFORE WE UNDERSTOOD IT. WE STILL HAD A MILLION QUESTIONS. PEOPLE WOULD ASK US, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT?" YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW." WELL, WHAT about this scripture? I don't know. Well, this scripture proves trinity. HOW DO YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. UH, BUT I STILL BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; We didn't come when WE FIGURED IT OUT. AND WE DIDN'T START PROCLAIMING IT BECAUSE WE HAD ALL THE ANSWERS. Something down inside of us, a seed gene OF GOD BY PREDESTINATION WAS ALREADY pre-programmed that when they heard the word like they did in the book of Acts WHEN PAUL AND BARNABAS CAME, THOSE that were ordained to eternal life, they believed. And you were chosen to believe this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't believe it because you decided to. &gt;&gt; If you decided to believe it, you'll be one of those who will leave it one day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I promise you that. &gt;&gt; But if against your will and beyond YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT AND AGAINST ALL AGAINST ALL OF YOUR resistance and intellectualism and ALL OF YOUR UH PUSHING AGAINST IT, YOU STILL BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, when David was king, anointed king, before he came into the role of king and he was being chased because of a jealous former king running him from cave to cave to cave. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT OR PLEASANT or easy to be an anointed king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he still was the anointed king. &gt;&gt; There's times that believing this message isn't convenient, isn't easy. It's caused pain. It's caused rejection. It's caused &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But guess what? We still believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz when if you decide to believe, you can decide not to believe. &gt;&gt; But if you never decided to believe, you just did, &gt;&gt; you can't stop it. No matter how many times your heart gets broken, no matter how confusing things are, no matter how many times people show you contrary evidence, &gt;&gt; you can't help it. &gt;&gt; I believe. Why do you believe? Because I believe. &gt;&gt; Because I've been ordained into eternal life. Because he chosen me before the foundation of the world to believe. And I can't help it. I've been ordained &gt;&gt; to believe. You know what that means? &gt;&gt; Then I must be part of the true seed. &gt;&gt; You know what else that means? That means he's whispering his love secrets in my ear. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? I'm a sweetheart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm good and not because I'm prettier, not because I'm better, but because he chose me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the bride's not choosing the groom. The groom's choosing the bride. All the bride's doing is surrendering to the groom's choice. &gt;&gt; And I choose to surrender to the groom's choice. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to surrender to the groom's choice? &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, Lord, you can have this vessel to use. God bless you. Let's bow our heads and pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much for your word. God, it's a constant encouragement to our faith. And God, we realize now that we are what we are by predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, we all have earthly parents. We have genetics. We have things that construct our facial features, our stature, some of our characteristics. But deeper than all of that is a segene of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Something you chose, one of your thoughts, Lord, that you had of yourself before the foundation of the world. and you ordained that we would be part of your chosen generation, your chosen family. We are here, Lord, as believers, not because we chose, but because you chose. But because you chose, you can keep, you can empower, you can equip, you can overcome. Every obstacle, and every threat against our faith, you can conquer. And we're trusting in you, Lord, to keep your word in us and to keep your promise to us that we're going to make it all the way to a translation. God, we never volunteered to be your children. We never chose. You chose for us. But oh God, we surrender. We surrender in joy. We surrender and lay our lives down at your feet and say, "God, all that you said is true." And we thank you, God. Lord, we're so appreciative and so thankful. And God, I still feel like I can't, but I know that you can. And if you chose, then you've got all the power to make it come to pass. I love you, Lord. And I give myself aresh to you and ask all that you would forgive us for our falterings, Lord, for being distracted and confused. But Lord, may we come back to our first love through the quickening of our hearts, Lord, when you burned within us your truth. And may may we fan those flames of that first love and ever stay so in love with you and connected to the truth that you revealed to us that it becomes more than life to us. becomes everything, Lord. And that your word, Lord, will make a way for itself. And that you'll overcome every obstacle by yourself. That you will provide all that we have need of in this life's journey. For we're trusting in you, not in us. Because it wasn't us to begin with. It was you to begin with. So now we surrender to your purpose for our lives. We proclaim, Lord, that it's your grace that has made us what we are. And by your grace, Lord, I am what I am. Now carry us forward in your plan and use us for your glory. May we accomplish in this end time, Lord, that very purpose you've purposed us for as we surrender to you. Be with your children. Carry us forth under your anointing. You have poured out the oil of anointing through a prophetic message in this end time. And now you've poured out your spirit upon us to accomplish by your power your word. And now we're trusting in that. We ask God that you would bless us now as we move forward in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Well, I know that I am nothinge to bear the Christian name for every blunder that I make. I've just myself to blame. But glory halleluah, I don't see them at all. And neither does my savior. For the blood has cleansed them all. In him, in him is the only place for me. I won't go back for anything. to where I used to be. The sun is always shining and the victory's been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. And why do you talk of sorrow? For there is none in here. In Christ is no unhappiness. In Christ there is no fear.
