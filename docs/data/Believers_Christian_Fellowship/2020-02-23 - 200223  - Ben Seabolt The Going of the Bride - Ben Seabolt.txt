oh that's really true all that really matters is so take the grandest things you know that life can get just weigh it with eternity one thing i have learned in all my life i believe that really counts yes is the lord i'm sure that's each and every one of our prayers and desires this morning everything to gain nothing to lose what a position to be in what a privileged position to be in there's only a select group of people in the face of this earth that can say that and it be true everybody else has everything to lose and nothing to gain what a privileged position we're in just greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ this morning we certainly deem it a great privilege to speak to the bride of jesus christ and those that he has purchased by his own blood we don't take that lightly we just consider it an honor and a privilege if you have your bibles we'll turn straight to the scriptures this morning and we're going to turn to first corinthians 15 beginning with verse 51 and i would like to speak on the subject of the going of the bride beginning first corinthians verse 15 chapter 51 or i'm sorry verse 51 says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed that's our promise saints sages and prophets and every person that's walked the face of this earth has looked for that promise but that's our day and our hour and our promise let's turn to first thessalonians chapter 4. first step thessalonians chapter 4 beginning with verse 15 speaking along the same lines he says for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord let's just bow our heads for a moment precious lord jesus we just want to pause here a moment to ask you to come and have the preeminence once again lord we've came and we've sang the songs of zion there's a wonderful atmosphere created lord we've read your holy script but lord now we would just like to set ourselves aside both speaker and here and just ask that the lamb would come and do only that which the lamb can do and is worthy to do and to take this book and these words therein and to loose them and to break them to the people lord we commit ourselves to you thankful for this opportunity giving you praise for this opportunity and we just asked now that you would come and do that which you have divinely purposed this time for in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the bride says god bless you as you would have your seats i would like to direct you to a quote that i guess was started my inspiration for this in 1964 recogni recognizing your day and its message brother branham says as a minister of the gospel i can't see one thing left but the going of the bride this is a very direct statement it's a very profound statement but if you brother branham says if you take a scripture and you look at it shallowly you'll get a shallow answer the same thing will apply with this quote if you take this quote and you look at look at it shallowly then you'll get a shallow answer so i'm going to finish reading this and then i'm going to come back to that portion and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what's happened speaking of the jews they were scattered blinded and now gathered what's left the bride has to be taken out of the way waiting for the going of the bride so that their prophets of revelation 11 can call them to the feast of trumpet and to make them recognize what they've done so he's laying that in there that before anything can happen with the jews that the bride has to be taken out of the way and he says as a minister of the gospel and obviously we know he's the prophet for the age he says that i can only see one thing left before that happens and that's the going of the bride but what we have to make sure is we don't look at this with a shallow impression that the going of the bride is if any different than the coming of the bride because the coming of the bride is a process just like the coming of christ was a process christ came and that was a process christ went and that was a process the bride has come and that's been a process and when the bride goes and as the bride's going that will be a process so we have to make sure that we don't just get hung up on the going of the bride and we take all of that and tie it into these scriptures that we just first read that oh that's just a moment and a twinkling of an eye that that's just one little dot that's the going no that's the culmination of the going but the going is the same as the coming and the going is going to be exactly like christ's going was and that's what we really want to look at this morning is it's just very i don't necessarily want to preach this but i just want to take my time and very slow and teach these principles of the of the conditions and the requirements surrounding the first going of christ because that pattern is laid in the scriptures and whether you like it or whether i like it it doesn't matter that pattern will not change it will not change so the only thing that we can do is get on board with that because if not we're going to find ourself confused with no understanding and eventually we'll find ourselves fighting against the very plan of god and that's a condition we don't want to be in he says as a minister of the gospel i can only see one thing left the going of the bride if you'll take your bibles and turn to matthew chapter 21 and you can keep your bibles handy because we're going to go through several scriptures here in matthew beginning in chapter 21 and ending in chapter 26. this is going to lay down the patterns the pattern and the condition surrounding the process of the going in jesus's life matthew 21 verse 6 it says and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass the cult and put them on them their clothes and they set him there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way notice what class of people this is a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way strew them in the way and the multitude that went before and that followed cried hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee so here is a here is a great multitude and this is the coming of jesus this is the culmination of his of his coming he's now coming into the holiest city he's now coming to where all these scriptures are going to be fulfilled he's coming into jerusalem and this multitude that is there they're worshiping him they're singing praises they're laying their clothes down they're laying the palm branches down and then somebody poses a question who is this and they give the response this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee and they are 100 accurate and they are 100 wrong this is the class of people that we are not this is the multitude this is not the bride and that's what the multitude sees they can get worked up when everybody else is getting worked up they can scream and worship with the best of them they can throw their clothes off they can throw palm branches down but when they come to have a definition of who this is well that's the message of the hour you're 100 right you're 100 percent wrong who is this appropriate answer is this is god himself in the form of flesh that was the answer then that's the same answer now matthew 21 verse 12 and jesus went into the temple and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and he said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them and when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased and he said unto them hearst thou what they say us i'm sorry they said unto them unto him hear us now what they they say and jesus said unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise skipping to verse 45 and when the chief priest and the pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a profit i don't know if you just caught it but in that portion of scripture we made the dispensational cornerstone of from the coming of jesus to the going of jesus and that transpired there in verse 15. and when the chief priest and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased there's your cornerstone this is the point of the dispensational change this is the point where it goes from coming to his going and what that was is when he exposed them when he came in and he exposed them and he and he told them the truth something along the lines of i and my father are one they were sore displeased they would have culminated his going right then if they could but they couldn't because there were other factors that there were other scriptures concerning his going that had to be fulfilled but it says here in verse 46 if they would have had it their way that would that his coming would have immediately been followed by his going it would have been a very very very quick process because they went from being very sore displeased to wanting to lay hands on him in verse 46 and the only thing that stopped them was the multitude of people that they had not convinced yet and they needed something there was a there was we'll get to it here in a minute but there was something that the multitude needed to facilitate this going because they could not break the scriptures but we have to hone in on this because this is extremely because as i this is extremely important because like i said before the pattern's not going to change saints it doesn't matter where whether we like it or whether we don't like it or whether we're comfortable with it or whether we're not comfortable with it this is a scriptural pattern it will not change and the start of that is when jesus catches a revelation of who he is and he knows where to go and he knows where to set what to say and where to say it and who to say it to this is preeminence in flesh and he comes to the place where he's supposed to be and he speaks the words that he's supposed to speak and they are sore displeased matthew 24 so that was ending that was in chapter 21 and from 21 until 24 he's just speaking parables to the multitude he's just laying the scriptures in there he's just speaking to them exposing them exposing you know the desires of their hearts he's he's just laying all those parables in there about them and about other things but he's speaking in parables to the multitude this changes when he comes to chapter 24. and jesus went out and departed from the temple that's the end of your church ages they're done this pattern will not change jesus went out of the temple he departed from the temple he he was not there anymore it didn't matter whether they wanted him to be there or not it didn't matter if they liked whether he was there or whether he wasn't there the fact of the matter was he was no longer there period and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he set up on the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately notice this is a totally different group this is a totally different ministry this is a totally different class of people this is who he was dealing with dare i say this was a precursor to the bright age this was no longer in the temple in the church ages this was to a this was to a very select group of people this was to an exclusive group of people and this is the pattern that's laid down the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world they want to know the mysteries and they've come to him privately and they said tell us privately tell us these mysteries that you've been speaking about dare i say he opened the seals to them privately not to the multitude to his bride this was the shout out this was the precursor to the shout this is this is the pattern that was laid down that made first thessalonians or second thessalonians be accurate a shout a voice a trump this was the shout to the disciples this is the same scripture if you'll go back and pull the sixth seal this is the same chapter that brother branham takes to to break all of the six seals he goes back and picks up matthew 24 and he shows how every seal laid in that and this is what the disciples are wanting to know privately and jesus took them to a place privately and he expounded on those things you'll notice jesus left the temple before he broke the seals like it or don't like it the seals were not broke in the temple the seals were not broke in the church ages we have to catch that pattern we have to understand that we're not going to change that and we can't have a problem with that this message is an exclusive message it is only to certain people that's god's choosing that's god's sovereignty we're not going to change that we should be happy that we're a part of that people that doesn't make us superior to anybody because it wasn't anything that we did it was his sovereign grace extended to us but just because i'm the recipient of his sovereign grace i am not going to try to change that and change his sovereign will and make it a social gospel or a social message the scripture shows the pattern is not like that and we can't try to change it it's only for a certain certain group of people the disciples came to him privately saying tell us the secrets and you know what he did he told them the secrets so let's go to chapter 26 and this is where i really want to look at the conditions and the requirements surrounding because remember we're already in the going of his ministry now he's already came they got the multitude the scribes and the pharisees and the multitude and the religious leaders got so displeased at the things that he had to say that was the change we're not going back anymore now we're moving forward in the going this is now part of the going and it came to pass matthew chapter six verse one when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples you know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified so now he's taken them privately he's broken the seals to them and they've had a glorious time no doubt they had a wonderful time sitting there at the feet of jesus letting him break the seals to them may i say it was sweet in their mouth but now all of a sudden he says something that's not so sweet and this is after the seals have been broken he says something that comes after there's a sweetness in the mouth now there's something that becomes bitter in their belly he says and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people under the place the palace of the high priest who was que ephesus and they consulted that they may might take jesus by subtility and kill him but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment this woman's the bride just so you we make that very clear having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he set at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation in the nation if you'll skip over you don't have to turn there but if you skip over to john this person this person this disciples identified as judas we know that but they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste what purpose is this waste this is pure unadulterated total preeminence worship to god in flesh and it's identified by an individual as a waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor then jesus understood it and said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath brought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but ye but me ye have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her then one of the tale 12 called judas iscariot went unto the chief priest and said unto them what will you give me for him and i will deliver him unto you and they coveted with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he meaning judas sought opportunity to betray him brother branham says that in the last moments of jesus's physical life here on earth there were so many multitudes and dozens and dozens of scriptures that transpired and were fulfilled he had thirty uh three and a half years worth of ministry but when he when he come down to that very last few moments of his ministry there were hundreds of scriptures brother brandon said were just fulfilled just like this one after another after another there were so many scriptures that laid in the old testament that were fulfilled just in this passage alone so many of them so we've had the multitude we've had the response of the multitude we've had the disciples we've had the response of the disciples but now we come to one person this is one person with jesus one person with jesus and this one person this one little bride is now going to do the thing that exposes not the spirit and the multitude but it's going to expose the spirit within the framework of the true church this is the portion that the multitude needed that they couldn't make happen because they weren't close enough because the scripture said it would deceive the very elective possible but now this one individual is going to do one thing that unleashes hell on earth that unleashes all demonic forces all satanic purposes to fulfill the scripture of what must take place to jesus one individual one little lady is going to do one thing that allows the scriptures to be fulfilled this one little lady is literally holding up all of the prophecies of the new of the old testament everything in the old testament relies on this one individual this one little unholy unrighteous full of mistakes woman she controls the piece she's the one with the watch in her hand she's the one that says what what will happen and when it will happen everything the culmination of jesus's physical coming now rests in this one little woman and she has no clue about it nobody has a clue about it not the disciples not the multitude she doesn't even know herself but everything that needs to transpire for me and you to even be setting and standing here today covered under the bleeding bloody word of god himself is now is now resting upon this little lady and she has one thing that she's going to do that allows the timepiece to continue and that one thing has nothing to do with an alabaster box but that one thing was even before the alabaster box when she decided i'm going to take everything that i have i am going to take everything that i have and i'm going to give it for this when that one little woman made that decision in that little room you know where i'm at when she made that one decision in that little room of her prayer closet i'm going to take everything that i've got and i'm going to give it to him nobody else on the face of the earth knew that the entire old and new testament was hinging upon this little lady nobody had a clue but what unleashed everything to continue as it was ordained to continue was this little lady standing in the way and what allowed that timepiece to continue was when she made the decision everything that i've got i'm going to give it that's what allowed it to continue that is the pattern you and i will not change that pattern it doesn't matter how much we work it up or how much we pull it down until we give all the timepiece will not move i've got news for you saints the news is not ran by a political force the news is not ran by climate control the news is not ran by an outside force what you read in the news is directly related to one little lady on the face of this earth one little lady on the face of this earth is controlling the headlines around the world that's what's in control nothing else is in control you and i are in control you and i are in control nothing else you say well god's in control that's what i said brother branham says god can do nothing unless he uses your hands unless he uses your feet unless he uses your mouth god can do nothing and god can do nothing until we are willing to give all that's the scriptural pattern 99 will not change it it has to be 100 so simple so simple so simple but yet the entire old and new testament hinged on that lady making that decision it had nothing to do with an alabaster box had nothing to do with the ointment had nothing to do with what she was wearing what it had to do with was when she gave preeminence and when she decided i'm going to give everything now the timepiece can continue because what this did when this little lady made that decision what this what this did was it allowed jesus to expose the judas that was in the midst because god can't force them to do anything they have to do it of their own free will so now jesus will create the situation for some little lady who's not worthy to come and give him true worship the way he's chosen to have true worship by giving preeminence by giving everything that she has and a result of that is the judas the judas spirit is exposed it can't help itself brother branham says that balaam he never really liked that that people of israel to begin with in his heart he never really liked them to begin with but he needed something to expose that the scripture says judas was a thief at heart but he needed something to expose that so this little lady unknowingly she don't care about all the repercussions she's not sitting around trying to figure out if i do this this will happen or what do i do and no she made a decision one thing i'm going to give everything that i have to that man and the results of that just happened she didn't have to make it happen what she did automatically exposed it because if you're a thief at heart or if you never really like that people to begin with it's going to be manifested but i'll say like the scripture says and like jesus says woe be to that man it would be better they were never born but you're not going to change the fact of that what's in a person's heart's going to be manifested that's the age that's the time that's the purpose that we live in so i don't know that i can lay enough emphasis on this but there's a lot more ground to cover so i'm going to move on but i wouldn't encourage you not because i've said it but i would encourage you to write it down because this is what everything hinges on everything hinges on this you can look and try to see well this is going on here and this is going on here what's going on i don't understand how don't worry about it don't worry about it it's not your place your place is this lady your place is to do what this lady did the rest of it will take care of it and as brother branham says if god needs you to know something or want you to know something he'll reveal it to you you worry about being this lady everything else will be just fine you'll notice this lady was not concerned about the persecution that was going to come no doubt she knew it was going to not be well received no doubt she knew there was going to be things said no doubt she knew they may even pick her up and throw her out this lady was not concerned about the after effects of giving all she was not operating in an element in a realm and a spiritual condition of fear this lady had no fear maybe in her carnal self in her hybrid flesh she she had mixed emotions but that's irrelevant because she had already made the decision i'm going to give all and that decision is not based on fear or what might happen she was not operating in an atmosphere of fear she was operating an atmosphere of pure unadulterated preeminence worship that's where we have to be at continuing in verse 36. so again i just maybe i need some big letters to hold that up in i don't know everything hinges on your and i preeminence to christ himself everything everything hinges on that nothing else can move until that takes place uh continuing in verse 36 then cometh so that was number one of the conditions surrounding the going of jesus that was number one so let's move on down the list verse 36 then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto disciples i'm going to stop right there before i read the next verse but i want you to realize we were reading a few verses ago in the coming and what a joyous time it was look how quickly that changed what changed is they turned a corner it changed from the coming to the going when it's coming it's joyous immediately when it turns to go it's no longer joyous it's sorrowful it's heavy the scripture says that's not a bad thing saints scripture is being fulfilled why does it matter if we're joyful when scripture is being fulfilled or if we're sorrowful when scripture is being fulfilled so long as scripture is being fulfilled because brother branham says god's will is his word and if his word is being fulfilled why why does it matter if we were happy or were sad about that it doesn't matter let's be happy where it matters in the realm that it matters by let by recognizing scriptures being fulfilled and he cometh unto the disciples and finding findeth them asleep and he saith saith unto peter what could you not watch with me but one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cup may not pass away from me i accept i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doeth betray me condition number two surrounding the going of christ was the lack of the dedication to prayer not in the multitude in the true church even more so with three individuals in the true church that's condition number two those that he selected and anointed for prayer could not keep dedicated prayer for one hour the pattern's there it's not going to be changed fortunately we don't have to repeat what they did because that's not our position this pattern was laid here so we would recognize the conditions that would repeat but just because the conditions repeat our response doesn't have to be repeated you understand what i'm saying the conditions won't change that is set in stone it will not change that pattern is it's infallible the response to that condition and to that pattern depending on your time frame that you're living in can change because as the word comes the response can go higher and higher and higher but the pattern of the conditions and the anointings and the spirits surrounding those time frames as those events are occurring that will not change the only thing that can possibly change is as the ages move on and the timepiece moves on and the answers are given as paul says all these things that were done in the past were for our admonition now the response can change to be a correct response but this condition is here not will be here this condition is here and it has to be here because it was there it was in jesus first going it's got to be in jesus's second going yes i'm aware i just said jesus is second going misses jesus christ the conditions are going to be the same the inability to keep dedicated prayer for one hour that's all they ask just pray with me for an hour i'm not preaching doctrine i'm just saying what jesus said you can pray for however long you want to just don't repeat the cycle and when he says this is the key when he says now we should always pray but when he says pray with me when he says pray with me don't repeat the cycle you'll notice when jesus came to them the third time and he says sleep on now and take your rest he was not speaking to a natural condition because the very next verse he says rise let's go you just told me to sleep now you're telling me to go what do you want me to do he wasn't speaking to a natural condition and telling them to sleep what he was saying is they had failed the test so just go ahead and do whatever you're going to do now it's irrelevant but let's go the one that betrays me he's coming too late see they had already failed his response to them wasn't their natural condition his response was to their spiritual condition and he was letting them know you might as well just stay on in that you've done missed you've done missed the opportunity brother brenda says i'm getting ahead of myself that condition won't change it will not change but we don't have to repeat the cycle we have the ability and we have the anointing and we have the power to keep dedicated prayer time when he says to pray when he doesn't say to pray pray anyhow that's good that's wonderful that's we should do that but it's especially important when he says to pray totally different when he says to pray because if he's told you to do something he has to anoint you to do it brother branham says a man cannot do anything but yet god anoints him to do it so if he says do this he's got to anoint you to do it you have to receive that anointing to do it there's an emphasis being lay on prayer right now and i'm sorry i can't change my note just because what the pastor came out and said i can't help that blame it on him but the emphasis is on prayer and i want to say this and this is going to be bold and i hope it don't offend you but when jesus told the disciples to pray it was jesus in a corporal body standing there telling them to pray jesus in a corporal body is not going to come and tell you to pray how is he going to come and tell you to pray i just told you a little bit earlier god can do nothing but he uses your mouth your hands and your feet it's going to be a flesh vessel but it's not going to be the nail scarred corporal body of jesus christ telling you to pray better recognize who's speaking and who's telling us what to do and recognize that it's not just a man how miserable of a people we would be if we were just led by a man and what a man felt to do this condition is repeating and the reason that we're not going to repeat the failure is because we've been instructed not to that's his grace to us saints there's a reason that's being emphasized is because that condition is laying there and we're in the going of the bride and that's a condition that we have to combat matthew 26 47 and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whosoever i kiss that same as he hold him fast and forthwith he came to jesus and said hell master and kissed him and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him this was the thing that the chief priest scribes and the religious leaders of that day needed to facilitate what they wanted to do they were powerless to do anything because the scripture said he would be betrayed of one of his own and until one of his own came to them and coveted with them to do that very thing they were absolutely powerless they would try to do something to him he'd just walk through a wall they would try to stone him to death he'd just walk away just disappear but now the scriptural conditions that have been prophesied are laying in order and now the only thing that's changed the only thing that's changed from any of the prior events is now one of his own that walked with him that he called his own not one of his own one that he called his own he called him a friend within the framework of the true church judas was called a friend not by the disciples by god jesus himself said friend wherefore they'll come from the pattern's not going to change saints like it or don't like it the denominations are not going to be the one that disappoints you the rank and file message believers are not going to be the one that disappoints you it's going to be the one you call friend you say well then i just can't trust anybody why do you need to trust anybody why does it matter who you trust or who you don't trust the scripture is not going to waver the scripture is going to be fulfilled and if god has to hold our eyes to a judas among us so that the scriptures can be fulfilled praise god praise god until god tells me that's not my brother that's my brother until god tells me that's not my sister that's my sister until god tells me it's an enemy of god i'm going to call him friend and if god if god withholds my understanding and it makes me look like a fool at the end so be it it doesn't matter that i know everything and can discern everything what matters is the scripture progresses that's what matters so i don't need to live in tension and anxiety of who i can trust and who i can't trust trust them all the lamb said don't hurt my oil and wine it doesn't matter who i trust they can't hurt me unless he lets them hurt me call them friend call them brother don't worry about trying to understand what i'm saying i'm not saying we shouldn't use spiritual discernment but don't worry about getting hurt you're going to get hurt face the facts it's going to hurt bad way worse than you even anticipate mark my words not that my words mean anything it's just an expression i guarantee it it's going to be closer and it's going to hurt worse than you can even anticipate i guarantee that i guarantee that the re the appropriate response to that is to keep the fountain open keep the fountain open until he says turn off the fountain keep the fountain open if he's calling them friend right up until that time call him friend right up until that time let him identify who is who don't worry about the hurt that's coming you're going to get hurt there's nothing you can do to there's nothing you can do to stop it saints it has come and it's going to come it's going to get closer and closer and closer that's the negative the positives those that are really his are going to be closer and closer and closer and closer to you to the point you can chew their chewing gum that's close it's going to be close saints it's a condition laid in the scripture it's the only way the scriptures can advance don't worry about that be a brother be a sister be a friend let god reveal who is who it's not he's not going to reveal it too late he's not going to reveal it too late we'll know but we'll know at the appropriate time and we don't have to worry about them hurting us they are powerless they are powerless the lamb has already said hurt not the oil and wine they are powerless anything that they can and will and have done is because the lamb has approved it and if he's approved it i approve it and if he's approved it i say be it unto me according to your will according to your word because i know whatever you're approving this for my good and i know whatever you're approving is for the advancement of this timepiece the going of the bride see we can pray for a body change all we want i've got news for you your body is not going to change tomorrow i'm going to get crucified over that i know but i'm just going to say it anyhow i have got a list of scriptures and a list of quotes that have not been fulfilled your atoms are not changing tomorrow it's not happening saints it is not happening the words of the prophet are not going to fail because we are begrudging our extended stay the words of the prophet and the scriptures are not going to change because we're uncomfortable the words of the prophet and the things that he has prophesied and what lays in the scripture is not going to change because we want to whine about things we are a chosen elect group of people to stand here in satan's eating and fight face a politically backed persecution with physical consequences and until we do that our atoms are not changing we have got to get praise the lord we have got to get out of that mindset i have heard that preach for years and years and years and years to where where children are in i mean when i was in first and second third grade i'm like you know fourth grade what's the matter my atoms are going to be changing that's not true now i understand there was revelation withheld from that generation because it wasn't time yet but that's not the time we live in brother branham says that god couldn't release all his truth to those church age dispensations because if they knew what time it really was it would it would release them from all tensions and and looking for his coming and they would not operate appropriately you understand we do not operate under a church age anointing we operate under a bride anointing and the bride will know what time it is and the what time it is does not dictate our relationship to jesus christ what dictates our relationship to jesus christ is divine love so it doesn't matter whether things are good being prophesied or things are bad being prophesied or what is to come or what has come that does not change my relationship my relationship and my conduct is based on my divine love to him period and just because he tells me my body is not going to change for a little while longer it does not change how i operate that is not the age that we live in this bride is going to be able to operate under knowing what time it is what's coming her way and be perfectly fine with that if you're looking for an easy way out and you're adam's to change before you face persecution you better get out now because it's not going to happen and that is not the anointing for this people this anointing for this people is to know exactly what's going on and exactly what they're coming to and be okay with the fact that i'm not going to have an easy way out we don't live in the days of well praise god the rapture is going to be tomorrow let me rephrase that your body change is going to be tomorrow your body change is going to be tomorrow we don't live in that age anymore saints it is not okay to preach that it is wrong it is wrong according it is wrong according to what the prophet and the scriptures say i may get crucified about that i don't care it's the truth the scriptures and what the pro we are not going to leave here with 90 percent of what the profit is said to come to pass being being brought to pass and 10 percent not it's not going to happen either he was god's prophet and everything he said is going to come to pass or he wasn't god's prophet we can't just lay lay and shuffle away the bad things and say oh well our bodies will change before that old bodies will change before that it's not going to work it's been prophesied it has to be done and there is a people on the face of the earth that are okay with that you may call me crazy but i do not want my atoms to change tomorrow that's ludicrous to say that it's absolutely ludicrous but what's more important to me than my adam's changing and me having it good is seeing the scriptures fulfilled and i i do not want to face him on that day and say i wimped out on him or that i took an easy way out i want to look at him and say i am thankful that you told me what day and what hour and what was coming and that you gave me grace and gave me strength to overcome that and to stand in that adversity and i did not shirk back from that responsibility and i did not look for an easy way out i want to be able to say it say i'm thankful that your prophet told me these things were coming and i'm thankful you gave me grace not to shirk from them and i'm thankful that you gave me the ability to stand on everything that he said and not just the good things i don't want to face him as a coward and i don't want to preach false doctrine that your atoms are going to change tomorrow when there are quotes and scriptures that have not been fulfilled now i will disclaim this by saying this one thing that brother branham has said things that will transpire and i am not going to put a timeline on that it can happen very very very very quickly very quickly so when i say your atoms are not going to change tomorrow i'm not going to put a 24-hour period on that i will say this until everything that the prophet has said is to transpire your atoms are not changing and you are in direct control of that because nothing can transpire until you give him preeminence and when you give him preeminence things can transpire very very very quickly but the things that the prophet has said we have to get comfortable with the fact that there is a timeline for those things to occur and all of those things are not going to occur in the next 24-hour saints it's just not going to happen it is not going to happen brother branham was so in tune with this and brother branham was okay with this i can show you the quote he says you know what i've got ahead of the timeline he says i have to pull back a little bit because these things over here have to catch up if he's comfortable and he's okay with doing that why can't we be why can't we be why can't we be comfortable with the fact that our atoms are not that we are so in tune with god that we know our atoms are not going to change tomorrow because his word here here and here has not been fulfilled if we know the truth what's wrong with preaching the truth why do we need to cuddle people and tell them just hang on a little bit longer your atoms will change just stick around just tough it out a little bit more just hang in there hang in there hang on your atoms are going to change just any time just any time you're out it's going to change since that's not what we're called to operate under if my atoms don't change and i die of an old age it doesn't matter how i'm going to operate i'm going to operate in divine love and preeminence towards god and if he sees fit to change my atoms then he sees fit to do that i believe that with all my heart that that's my calling i believe that with all my heart i am called to have a to experience the physical change of the body i believe that with all my heart but i'm not going to whine to god and tell him that he has to do that before all these things are fulfilled but what i will tell you is this when i face a physical politically backed persecution his ears are going to be ringing about my body change i guarantee you i'm going to be a squeaky wheel then and i'm going to get some grease because when that transpires he has no scripture to stand on you understand what i'm saying it's not like i'm arguing with god he has nothing to hold that he has nothing to hold that and the only thing that can hold that is his scripture so when his scripture has been fulfilled i will join you in the whining and the crying and and anything else that we can come up with but until then i am not going to insult god by trying and preaching something is going to happen when he has already vindicated a prophet and said these things must happen before your atoms change and he may not said that directly but he lays those things in there so that we can see those see brother branham even the age that brother branham was in wasn't the age we're in they couldn't handle that you think for a minute what people were standing with the prophet towards the end of his ministry would still have been around if he told them since it's going to be 2020 and we're still going to be here you talk about whittling a crowd down see he couldn't even release that in his time that's how close we are saints is now god knows there is a people with the character that he's looking for on this earth that he can literally tell them what time it is exactly and he knows that they won't try to alter the program or take an easy way out they will be comfortable knowing there is a politically backed persecution coming my way and i do not want my atoms to change until then because that is my calling my calling and purpose is to withstand that persecution by standing on the truth and by giving him preeminence and overcoming that and and delivering the final blow to the final to the final battle that's my calling what just think about this how awful who how many wants to live through eternity i think we would all say we want to live through eternity how awful would it be to live through eternity knowing that you had one little blip in eternity one little blip called tom and during that one little tiny blip of time you couldn't even do what he wanted you to do the all you had to do was whine and cry about how you wanted to get back into eternity and now you've got to spend eternity knowing that i chickened out on god now how many wants to spend eternity like that spend eternity knowing you went out on god he just wanted one thing he just wanted one thing and he was so kind and so gracious to tell us exactly how it was going to transpire and exactly when it was going to transpire brother branham says no man the scripture says no man knoweth the day nor the hour brother branham came and he says he didn't say you couldn't know the week the month or the year so what if i tell you that for the next five years we are going to face an intense onslaught of politically backed demonic forces what does it matter what does it matter it's been prophesied it has to be done see that's the character he's looking for is he's not wanting somebody to serve him based on the conditions he's wanting somebody to serve him because of who he is you recall i can't remember his name right off the bat but it was the servant that spit on david the one that would serve david when it was pleasurable to serve david and would spit on him when it wasn't so convenient god forbid we would ever be like that that's not our age that's not our anointing that is not who we are we are called to serve him because of who he is and what he has done for us period and be joyful in doing it that's the anointing that's released to us that's the character that he's looking for and he knows i believe that with all my heart he knows that there is a people now capable with that character of living under that truth and under that anointing they are comfortable living and serving him not for what they can get but for what but for who he is regardless of where the timeline is he can reveal that timeline to them so accurately and let them know exactly what's coming ahead and it doesn't waver their preeminence to him there's a reason these things can be preached now saints is because there's a people to hear him and there's a people to believe him and i know i'm not the only one i know i'm not the only one that's ludicrous to say that i don't want my atoms to change right now but i don't because i want to fulfill the scripture because this scripture is me and what he said about me i've got to do there's nothing that can change that that's what i want to do and i believe the adam's changing is a portion of that scripture but in order to get to that point to get to the climax of the going i've got to go through the process and i'm going to be joyful about that process i didn't say i was going to enjoy it i said i'm going to be joyful about that process during that process praise the lord condition number three is to be betrayed by friends like it or not it's already in the scripture matthew 26 51 and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear then jesus said unto him put up thy sword unto its place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinketh now that i cannot pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be condition number four is you fight back with no orders to do so from the captain fighting back with no orders to do so from the captain if the captain gives the orders to fight back it's totally different you remember when brother branham was facing the chicago ministerial association he says oh well that's easy i just won't go down there that was the appropriate response but then the captain came he says no you go i'll be with you now it's totally different now it's no holds barred now it's take no prisoners because the captain has said go but until the captain says go you can't fight back the reason they were in this condition the reason peter was in this condition is because of condition number two he failed to keep dedicated prayer time now a direct result of that was he found himself doing two things number one he was fighting back when he wasn't allowed to fight back he was actually fighting against the scriptures and number two he was fighting a spiritual warfare carnally he missed all of that because he didn't pray when god told him to pray how simple what consequences fighting against god is his scriptures we know he's fighting against god moving forward notice though now his motive and his objective were absolutely unadulterated snow white it doesn't matter what our motive and objective is if we're against the word brother branham says you can be sincerely wrong and the only way that you're going to make sure you're always right is if you meet condition number two dedicated prayer to god when he says pray in case you've missed it he's told us to be in prayer there's a reason he wants us to be in prayer oh here we go again i'm never going to finish jesus is in the garden with peter james and john and he says pray with me why did he want them to pray with him it was not going to change a single thing think about it i mean what what's he telling pray that i won't be crucified he already knows he's going to be crucified he's he don't want that in his flesh but he knows it's to be that's why he's praying thy will be done so you think he's going to tell his disciples go and pray that i don't have to go to the cross so why is he telling him to go and pray if it's not going to do any good for him same reason he wants us to pray when it don't do any good for us see prayer is not to change it prayer is not to change what's coming unless he's told you to pray to change what's coming that's a paradox i'm not even going to try to explain but it's possible but if he don't tell you to pray to change what's coming and he just tells you to pray he showed you how to pray let this cut passmanly but if not your will then let me drink it thy will be done see he came to them and he told them to pray not to change what was the scripture says was going to happen he told them to pray not so that it would be comfortable on them he told them to pray for one reason and that was so they would avoid condition number four [Music] fighting against the purpose and will of god with pure motive and pure objective he didn't tell them to pray to change their motive and objective that's not what he was after what he wanted to do was through dedicated prayer give them a proper understanding of where they were at and what was going to happen that's why he wanted them to pray not to change it he wanted them to pray so that they wouldn't be fighting against him or fighting a spiritual warfare carnally that's why he wanted them to pray he didn't want them to pray to change the conditions of the external forces he wanted them to pray to change the conditions of the internal forces he wanted them to pray to change themselves so now if they would have simply done what he told them to do they wouldn't have been fighting peter wouldn't have been fighting against the word of god and they would not have operated in fear when the multitude came if they would have just done what he told them to do when the multitude came they would have went down there to the council with him with no fear and they would not have been touched because that would have distracted from the glory of christ and that was not scriptural to begin with they didn't need to die for the sins of the world he did what a testimony one hour in prayer now gives me a proper understanding of where i'm at in time and what i'm to do and it alleviates me fighting a spiritual warfare carnally and that alleviates me from operating in fear we've seen what the results of not keeping that will do those two results that i just gave you are the conditions that will happen if you do do it you will know what time you're living in and you will not be operating in fear that's what we're called to that's what he wanted the disciples to do but they failed that's why when he came back to them he said sleep on you missed it all right let's go he that betrays me he's here he wasn't wanting them to pray to change the outcome of the external forces he was wanting them he wasn't even wanting them to pray so they know who judas was he showed him who judas was whenever it was fit to show him who judas was judah showed himself he was wanting them to pray for one thing i'm sorry for two things so that they would know what time they were living in and they wouldn't be fighting against the purpose and will of god and that they would not be operating in fear he wanted them to go down to that council with them and not deny him like a chicken before the chicken crowed that's what he was wanting and they could have done it and been totally untouchable totally untouchable but they were operating in fear from a lack of dedicated prayer and they missed their opportunity what a testimony just think about that for a second look at the testimony that's recorded in peter about peter and even the miraculous that was surrounding it i'm the guy that cut the high priesteer off because i was trying to chop his head off i cut his ear off jesus picked it up put it back on and healed it oh my goodness hallelujah pentecostal revival totally missed the point all the signs and wonders and miracles surrounding that and it totally missed the point what if peter could go back in time hypothetically speaking and given another chance do you not think his testimony and his will would want to be the one i prayed when jesus told me to pray and you know what i did when multitude came and got him i laid down my sword because he never told me to fight i'm the one me i'm the one who walked down into the council with him and i wasn't scared and i knew they couldn't touch me because i'd done what he told me to do and i had a revelation that i was untouchable if peter had to do it again which do you think he would do which are you going to do which are you going to do what am i going to do that's the testimony i want i operated knowing what day and hour i lived in and i did not operate out of fear i operated out of love and preeminence praise the lord matthew 26 30 and when they had sang a hymn so this is after the last supper and when they had sang a hymn they went out into the mount of olives then jesus saith unto them all ye i'm sorry i've skipped something here i'm sorry yes sorry to confuse you so this was the last supper before he went to the garden before the multitude came and got him the reason that i had to bring this out of out of order is because this ties directly to condition number four so let's read this portion and then i'm gonna go back sorry if this confuses you but just stay with me so this is at the last supper before he goes to the garden and asks them to pray and when they had sang in him they went out into the mount of olives then jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad jesus has already told them what's going to happen you think that's not going to come to pass but after i am risen again i will go before you unto galilee peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter saith unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also saith all the disciples skipping to verse 56 chapter 24. so that was right before they went to the garden which is the topic we just discussed then we had the period of the garden and what transpired there the multitude came and got them with swords and staves and now we come to verse 56 speaking of all of this that's just happened and it says but all of this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all of the disciples forsook him and fled funny what he said was going to happen happened imagine that he told them this was going to happen and it happened this is condition number five in the pattern of the going smiting of a shepherd scattering of sheep smiting of a shepherd scattering of sheep and the inability to bear the offense of the shepherd the inability to bear the offense of the true shepherd it's in the scriptures it's not going to change the patterns there it has to repeat there will be the inability to bear the offense of a true shepherd may i say a true ministry the inability to bear that offense and that in turn relays into the smiting of a shepherd and the scattering of sheep because it's fine to stick with the ministry when everybody loves the ministry but what if a certain individual says that ministry is just a little you know just a little sideways is there an ability to stand with a true ministry that conditions their saints we better not miss it a true ministry speaking the true word of god a smitten shepherd scattered sheep it's a condition of the going of the bride when you see that condition it's a flashing red light of what time you're in the inability to bear an offense associated with a true ministry associated with a true shepherd flashing red light flashing red light can we bear christ's reproach they couldn't bear it in that day can we bear his reproach how are we going to bear his reproach in this day is because the form that he has chosen to come in is going to be an offense your brother and your sister is going to be an offense and you are going to have to make the decision you all thought i was just talking about a pulpit ministry didn't you oh no no no no no no that's the preliminary stuff that's not even the real stuff that just shows their callers real quick what about your brother and your sister what if you're in jail together and they say oh you're associated with this one that we brought in the lunatic who believes the guy from like 1950s or whatever is he still he still plays tapes of that guy you're associated with him oh you're associated with the god that says i and my father are one you're associated with him yeah the inability to bear the offense associated with a true ministry pulpit or not pulpit that's a condition of the going we should be thankful we see that condition because it means we're going we've we're well beyond the corner we've turned the corner we're going most of these things that i'm speaking here have already we've already seen them saints we've already seen them we've already experienced them we're currently seeing them and currently experiencing them there's one thing we'll get to the end that's you know not there yet but no doubts it's it's happening that's condition number five that we will not get away from we're going to have to make a decision about that not just in a pulpit your brother and your sister can you bear their offense can you bear the offense associated with them there's much i could say there much i could say there's things that are happening with our brothers and sisters that are only going to increase and they are going to be absolutely wonderful to the bride and they are going to be absolutely offensive to those around the bride i did not say the denominations i said to those around the bride it will be wonderful to the bride it will be offensive to those around the bride we're very familiar with that quote where brother branham says when you come to say i and my father are one then the shock will pull away we've seen preliminary things of that sure we've not seen that in fullness but when christ really starts to manifest himself not from the pulpit from the laity that's where he's trying to get saints that's been his goal all along in case you've missed it is not to have a good preacher his purpose and his goal is to have preeminence in a people and when that starts to transpire in the fullness of its power it will be absolutely wonderful to the bride and it will be an absolute offense to the people that's possibly sitting right next to them and you're going to have to make a choice are you going to be smitten and scattered or are you going to bear the offense of a true ministry that may have never got behind the pulpit in a day in their life but is ministering the living bleeding bloody word of god don't shirk away from that offense so i hopefully you can see now how that tied back into what uh what i said before matthew 26 59 now the chief priest and the elders and all the council sought false witnesses against jesus to put him to death but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses and said this fellow saith i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answer us thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god oh praise the lord i almost wish he would have been cardinal for just one second just just someone said oh me i'm sorry i thought you said my name high priest the religious leader i'm invoking you i'm enduring you by yourself tell me who you are what what blindness how sorrowful condition how sorrowful tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy i'll just interject this real quick when the high priest rent his clothes it wasn't just a sign he was mad this was actually a sign of a changing of the priesthood if you'll go back i'm sure many of you are familiar with that if you go back and look at that through the old testament when the high priest was forbidden to rent his clothes and when he did that changes the priesthood so i just want to throw that in there real quick you can go back and study that if you would like so this is there's a lot in those words watch what immediately preceded that jesus told him who he was and when he told them who it was it caused a reaction that by default changed the priesthood so that's just a side note i don't want to go down that trail but it's it's very relevant saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what thank ye they answered and said he is guilty of death what do you think is going to happen when you say i and my father are one i don't think i really need to expound much on that but condition number six was they're going to bring false witnesses they're going to hunt them down they're going to make sure they have at least two false witnesses and even when those witnesses aren't any good they're going to find you guilty of death anyhow but they are going to have false witnesses and they are going to accuse you of blasphemy i'm not talking about the denominations there will be false witnesses there will be accusations of blasphemy in the framework of the true church praise the lord matthew 26 67 then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee condition number seven is the opportunity and the temptation to misuse your power because at this point in time you will have it in its fullness in its fullness at this point in the timeline you will have it and the condition that you will be met with is the opportunity to misuse it at the in opportune time it's a very very powerful situation to be in and there's examples through the scriptures that we can bring up and show that that's there but just because you have the power doesn't mean you can use the power the same character that released that power to you must be the same character that you operated by and that's why i say you'll have it because jesus couldn't have been tempted with an opportunity to do something he didn't have the power to do anyhow he had the power at this time he had the opportunity the temptation was to misuse it you and i will face this same thing and thank god we are predestinated not to fail thank god for his grace that we are predestinated not to mess that up because i don't know about you i know about me and i guarantee you i would mess it up i'm saying the condition that i'm in now i would mess it up when i'm in that condition that's released to me i know i'll be incapable of messing it up because he's not going to release that to a character that can misuse it you say well what about elijah and the she bears elijah did not have the fullness of this saints no no no no we will have a more we will have more than what he had we will have what he had plus we will have a better character than he had you understand he did that because of flaw in his character brother brahm said it was an angry prophet the scripture says be angry and sin not it was powerful demonstration powerful demonstration i was wanting to use it yesterday because i was in a church i kid you not they were doing a funeral service and they used a curse word over the pulpit and said well it's okay for me to do that in the church because i'm just quoting what another person said about this guy i'm wanting some she bears saints i'm not going to lie i'm looking for some she-bears curse word over the pulpit and what was what was worse than the people laughing back is the minister sat there and allowed it it wasn't a message church just so just so you could calm down it wasn't a message church very carnal denominational church but just look at where they've got to saints curse word over the pulpit the congregation laughed he said it's okay to do it in church because i'm quoting what this guy said about my father and the minister allowed it like i said i'm not going to lie i'm looking for some she bears utter repulsive even in a you know brother brandon said they're just lodges we understand we have that revelation but just just if you look at it carnally it's a house of worship it's a pulpit and the conscience is so seared that you can do that tell me not tell me judgment's not ant god's not going to wink at that forever the opportunity and temptation to misuse power matthew 27 verse 1. so i'm an hour and a half in and i'm just now getting where i wanted to get so should i have you stand up and do jumping jacks they there's a study there's a study that says you can only keep people's attention for 50 hours in a sitting so if i have you all stand up and sit back down i get 50 more minutes right of your attention you can do that if you feel to do that nobody will look at you weirdly i just wanted to break that spirit just a minute because i really want you to concentrate on what's coming next here this is where i wanted to get so these are the conditions that led up to the very final climax of the going everything that we've we've touched on so far there's seven conditions i didn't make that up there was just seven conditions i don't know maybe there's a doctrine that i should be spiritual and catch behind that um just the way that it worked out that that's what i saw maybe there's i'm sure there's more than that that's just all that i saw there but now we come to the climax now we come to the purpose and the climax of the going matthew 27 verse 1 and when the morning was come all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death and when they bet had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontus pilate the governor and we know what happened from there they crucified him this is the final condition this is the scribes i'm sorry this is the chief priest the religious leaders of the day i cannot stress enough i am not talking about denominations as we know denominations it's definitely denominational spirit but i'm not talking about the common titles that we're associated with we are talking about the denominational religious spirit remember that was a natural occurrence we're in a spiritual occurrence that will bleed over into a physical occurrence but this is currently going on now we've seen it all over the spiritual condition is but now this is the change when all the chief priests and the elders of the people why do they need the people they're the chief priests why do they need the people took counsel against jesus to put him together and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontus pilate the governor there's your three classes of people that we have yet to face the religious leaders the people the government all three have to be unified against that bride and brother branham says when they are about to accomplish their cowardly plot he snatches her away [Music] you can't get to the snatching away without going through they're about to accomplish their cowardly plot don't try to change his words let it be the way he said it's going to be don't operate out of fear and a misunderstanding operate out of proper understanding and faith divine love [Music] these three must be joined together must be and no doubt but at an underlying level that we haven't been privy to yet they are joining together brother branham said when he was on the scene that that council was already set up but you remember the pattern we showed see if you were paying attention the council could do nothing until what they have to have the multitude and they have to have to have to have a judas judas wasn't here and when the prophet was here in the form that he needed to be in there wasn't even enough people that understood what was going on to resist what was going on and i don't say that disrespectfully i'm just saying that's the reality of it brother braden said they're preaching the seals as we've heard it he says you all aren't getting this you're not supposed to get it i mean how deflated spiritually but we would rather be honest than you know try to be like oh yeah i got it no he didn't i'd rather just somebody be honest you're not getting this you're just not getting it we'll get into that a little later on but we we had as brother bryan says i've got to pull back now and he says nothing sinfully no no nothing like that he says but i've just got to wait for these things to catch up what was he waiting to catch up what was he waiting to catch up the religious world would have crucified him then they wanted to then you'd think for a second they didn't want this man off the scene there were people prophesying of him going off the scene they missed how it was to happen but i mean they're prophesying he's going this way and he's going this way and then there were a lot of prophecies after that he got called off the scene in a car crash oh yeah the lord showed me he was going because he was you know he was abusing the word and he had got off i mean there was a lot of things after that he was taken off the scene that the lord had told people but you think for a second if they would have been able to snatch him off the scene and that ministry that they wouldn't have he was putting them all to shame because they couldn't combat that they could not combat that character in that living word that was in him to the point he would stand there in front of that ministerial association and say whoever it is whatever you've got just come and stand here with your bible and disprove me you think for a second that spirit's still not angry you think that spirits don't die saints the men passed away the spirit don't die you think for a second that spirit is not within the rank and file of the bride around her rank and file of the message church around the bride i would say and you think it's not roth steel you think it's not just absolutely just enraged from that proclamation i could be wrong just get your bible come here and stand disprove me anybody actually he didn't say he was wrong but that was just me saying that he knew where he stood he said i've preached this it's right if anybody can disprove me just bring your bible come here and stand you think for a second they're still not upset about that they would have crucified them that's why brother branham said so many times that i'll be shocked for this he was anticipating being shocked for preaching the gospel you'll notice he didn't quit preaching the gospel it didn't change one element of the way he was operating he didn't go buy a bulletproof vest he didn't go get you know body armor he didn't have bodyguards it did not it did not put him to operating in a level of fear or misunderstanding of where he was at what he was doing if i'm shocked for this i'm shocked for that the lamb approved it or it's not going to happen i was talking with some brothers there the other day and we'll get to this quote here in a second but you realize brother brown says it will come to the point in time that if you offer prayer for a man you'll be shot on the spot and i kind of got meditated on that i was like how how comical that actually is because you realize the person with the gun no matter what happens he leaves confused so option number one god instructs you to go pray for an individual you go there there's a man with a gun says you're not going to offer prayer for that individual or we're going to shoot you you pray for him anyhow he pulls out his gun he points his at you and it doesn't go off he's extremely confused option number two it does go off and nothing hits you maybe even more confused option number three maybe what we would term as worst case scenario but it does go off and it does kill you he still leaves confused of why any man would have a character and a love about him that knowing i'm going to shoot and kill him he still prays for his brother either way he leaves confused the devil does not know how to handle this power he does not know how to handle this character he does not have an understanding of how it works so if it does come to that point in time and worst case scenario happens just have the assurance and the joy that that guy's confused and you're in the sixth dimension so you'll you'll be okay that's maybe a little cardinal but seriously think about that they don't win saints they do not win no way at all no way at all so chapter 27 is the cornerstone of where all of this changes this is the climax this is the culmination of the going and this is a politically backed persecution brought on by the religious powers and the multitude of people who got the politics involved because the chief priests and the people cannot do anything until the politics tell them they can there's laws on the books that says you can't kill people for their religious beliefs in this country still that's why revelation 13 comes out of this country because it's out of this country the image not the beast the image to the beast comes out and then it gives power to the beast the image to the beast and the beast are two totally different things we have to recognize that and the image to the beast comes out of this nation by a politically a politically backed lawful persecution of the true bride of jesus christ that's why i can sit here and preach to you your atoms are not going to change tomorrow because that has not happened yet saints it has not happened and we are not going to get a free e-z pass we cannot get to the snatching away unless we first go through the attempted cowardly plot and i feel that i can say that and i feel there's a people here that believe that and like i said i'll always put that disclaimer out there that that can happen very quickly these look how quickly these things happen in jesus ministry but until they happen i'm not going to get ahead of god and i'm going to preach where we're at brother branham says the evidence of the holy ghost is to recognize your day and its message the evidence of the holy ghost is not to recognize a future day and its message the evidence of the holy ghost is to recognize your day and its message and as the revelation and the holy spirit is released in its fullness that clarity is going to get greater and greater and greater to the point it would tell a prophet that a prophet would say it didn't say you couldn't know the year the month or the week and none of that changes how we operate to our towards our god because we will be operating out of preeminence and divine love not looking for a way out that's the climax of the going now we know this pattern that was that laid here for us does not end in a crucifixion it ends in the in our atoms changing so that's where we can all rejoice scream glory hallelujah go back and read the scriptures that we started out with and have a good time that's the ending that's the sweet in the mouth but there's a lot of bitter in the belly in between there so we hopefully now have a proper timeline of where we're at and where we're operating at and the purpose of me ministering this is not to tell you something you don't know not to tell you you know something new but it's to refresh this because saints these this we say it's coming i'm going to say it's brother and says we're standing on the threshold of the millennium the threshold that's how close we are and when these things transpire you may not have we may not have the opportunity for somebody to go back and rehash all this to us so that we can get comfortable and remember where we're at and what's going on what's coming no these things are going to transpire just the way it transpired with jesus extremely quickly and it's going to be an individual walk at that time so i'll just say like peter said though you be taught correctly though you're pure in heart and though you're holy i just bring these things to your remembrance don't get out of the timeline of god and don't be scared of the timeline of god the story has a happy ending but don't try to skip chapters in it let him reveal to us where we're at okay so i'm going to go back to matthew 26 verse 69 and i'm going to show you the bride's position in all of this somebody please make that clock stop mercy goodness this is us this is the appropriate bride response to the very final seconds and climax of our going matthew 26 69 now peter set without in the palace and the damsel came to him saying thou was with jesus of galilee but he denied before all of them saying i know not what thou sayest and when he was going out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto him that we're with that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man and then after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou art also one of them for thy speech betrayeth thee then he began to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the crew that portion is obviously not the portion i was referring to this is the bride's portion and peter remembered the word of the lord which said unto him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly he went out and he repented peter went out and repented that's the bride's position peter recognized he'd got ahead of god he got out of the will of the lord he had been fighting against god he realized that what god told him was going to happen just happened i just did what he told me i was going to do i told him i'd die before i did it my motives were pure my objectives were pure but you know what he told me what was going to happen and it just happened now peter repented for his own ways he repented for getting out of the timeline of god he repented for trying to fight a spiritual warfare carnally he repented for being offended by a true ministry this is the bride's position this is the climax of the bride's ministry if you'll turn to revelation 13 i'm sorry revelation 3. so there's the pattern and then at the end of jesus ministry to the church natural in his day when he was physically in a corporal body on this earth this is the culmination of jesus ministry in and through his bride and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write verse 14. these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou work cold or hot sow them because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes without scythe that they might see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent you'll notice this condition was not met in the church ages this condition was not met in the multitude this condition was met in the individual this was out of the church ages this was out of the laodicean spirit this was a condition of the individual repentance repentance recognizing what what he was trying to say is he's brother reynolds says that this this portion of scripture was to the church age but the repentance wasn't you understand what i'm saying if you'll go back brother brainer says that this portion of scripture to verse 18 was to the church age he says a lot of ministers try to take this and use it to an individual like making an altar call he says that's he says this was a condition of the church age so i'm agreeing with what he's saying there what i'm saying is the church age didn't have this characteristic in it to repent you understand what i'm saying so now in order to display this characteristic of repentance it shows what what age you're in and it shows you're not in a layout can later see an age and condition this is the same condition that peter got into repentance for thinking his own ways pure motives pure objectives repentance for getting out of the word of god fighting against the word of god fighting a spiritual warfare carnally and this is the same condition this is just prior to the going of the bride this is just prior to the going of the bride in revelation and this same condition comes up be zealous therefore and repent the pattern's not going to change so guess what we need to do we need to be in prayer and we need to repent for our own ways i assure you if you do those two things you're going to be just fine you've got nothing to worry about if you deal with those two things pray when he tells you to pray repent when he tells you to repent be willing to do both in spite of all odds that's the condition we have to make continuing verse 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me i want you to go back to where we very first begin and remember what started all of this was one little lady who made a decision in that little room of her prayer closet i'm going to give all that i have until that's done none of this can come none of this can culminate but the reason that we've seen these things maybe not in their fullness yet and definitely not the politically backed persecution in this nation i'm not saying that's not going on in other portions of the nation but understand revelation 13 is a specific scripture of this nation that's what i'm speaking of and that has not been fulfilled yet in a physical way no doubt on a spiritual level and like i said no doubt they're having meetings about it right now i'm saying about a physical persecution towards the bride though that has happened and that specifically has to come out of this nation i mean yeah you go to iraq and say you're a christian they cut your head off i get that that's happening but that's not the fulfillment of revelation 13. revelation 13 has to come out of the united states it's very specific all of that has is hinging on me and you giving our all me and you giving preeminence if we want our atoms to change which i'm sure we all do more so as the days go by if we want to get to the climax and the culmination we have to follow the pattern and the condition and re respond appropriately to those things and that hinges on me and you giving preeminence amen i'm just going to read you a couple quotes to back this up and then we're going to bring this to a close 1954 acts of the holy spirit brother branham says i believe one of these glorious days when this united confederation of church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the united states and put over there according to prophecy then they'll form an image like unto the beast and i tell you the true church of god will be drove together the real true believers out of methodist and baptist and presbyterian pentecostal nazarene pilgrim holiness wherever whatever they'll be will go together and be cemented by the love of god that'll make the body of the lord jesus christ all believers and agnostics and shallow minded will be cast to one side they'll go right on into the confederation of churches there is so much there to preach i'm not even going to try but i just want to highlight a couple things brother branham gives us a specific point on the timeline here and he says and then i tell you the true church of god will be drove together what does that mean that means when the persecution comes the true church of god is still going to be here you can't be drove together if you're not here simple i know but i just want to make sure that we're catching that it doesn't say that they're going to be going sitting on a cloud somewhere he says when this persecution comes the true church is going to be drove together cemented by what not doctrine not because they all understand everything together cemented by love agnostics and shallow-minded will be cast to one side they'll go right on in the confederation 1963 what shall i do with jesus called christ and now the dynamics of this great regime that they've got built this big machine will work someday in the united council of the world council of churches which will make a forcing too you say when that happens he's saying basically as an individual they're going to say well when that happens i'll get right i believe that's what he was getting ready to say he cuts himself off he says you say when that happens it's going to be too late for you then you're already in it whether you want to listen to the saints whether you want to be or not you're already there see notice you've already got that spirit on you see what's controlling that you should be thankful if you can sit here and just in your carnal mind make the decision i would never join that counsel and i would never do that there will come a time though saints remember your mind is your spirit and if you have an anointing on that spirit it will change your mind and you will think you're doing right brother brandon says they will do this thinking they're doing right understand it is a spiritual driven that then physically manifests when it physically manifests that means they've already accepted the spirit brother random says when it comes to this point in time when we see these things happening then you'll say he says it will be too late for you then because you've already taken the spirit and when you take the spirit of something you're going to you're going to flesh that out it's going to happen your brain will align with that anointing and you will do things the same way the holy spirit works on us how many has had the holy spirit make you do something that you would not do normally why did you do it and what could you have done to stop it not a thing the same way that you take christ's spirit and it has preeminence on you and you do things you normally wouldn't do it's the exact same exact same for the false church they take that false spirit it gets preeminence and then they then they do things they normally would not have done that's why i say it's going to be close and it's going to be closer than you think and it's going to be the person that you would have never imagined because normally we'd say there's no way that brother or that sister would ever do anything like that but it's a spirit it's a spiritual condition that's why the ministry blasts against entertainment and worldly living so much it's not that if you line up to that that you're going to be fine if we don't want you operating under that spirit whether it's sinful or not if you're operating under that worldly spirit you're going to have something get on you that you don't recognize and you're going to be then operating and fleshing that out without even knowing it and then you'll get mad at the person that reveals it to you because they're not operating in that spirit and then that person will get mad at you because you see something they don't see and you tell them about it that's a whole nother topic for another day that's the way it's going to work those saints so let's get rid of our pride let's get rid of our pride and let's allow god to use the form that god has chosen to use to bring correction to us our brothers and our sisters the scripture says iron sharper than iron that's not an enjoyable process but that is god's way and will be more so i assure you it will be more so as time continues you are going to watch the ministry of jesus christ leave the pulpit and go into the people the pulpit will always be there to confirm it but that is not god's way and that's not his purpose and that's not his will brother brandon would say things like you know it's you older women's and responsibility in the church to deal with them young women dressing inappropriately brother branham should have never even had to preach on that he said it in the church who should deal with those things that's just one example you understand what i'm saying brother branham would have been happy the day he was out of a job that is the that is the five-fold ministries not the laity's ministry but that is the five-fold ministry's job is to preach ourself out of a job i cannot wait for the day that i don't have to preach anymore i will always have a ministry as your brother but i don't need to be a preacher i don't need to be a five-fold ministry preacher because when i come to that day the scripture says we are in perfection that's what i want i don't want to keep my preaching career alive while you all are in me or in perfection my goal and any true minister's goal is to preach ourself out of a job and the quicker we can get the ministry out of the pulpit and into the people the quicker we're getting out of here that is the key if you see somebody that's held up on pride and they won't accept the correction not only from the pulpit but from a brother and a sister they are the same way brother branham preached indictment to that generation they are indicted right then because that is the form that god has chose to speak is your brother and your sister now there's a side note to that because you say that's a very powerful situation to be in and you're right it is so now what thought and what meditation and what consideration should we give to the words coming out of our mouth now we start to have a proper understanding where brother branham says you should be a frank stern sober people it's not that brother branham didn't like laughing it's brother branham knew the position that was coming on the people and now we literally hold the power of god of mercy or judgment in our mouth and we can speak something to a brother or a sister that will be mercy or judgment to them depending on how they receive it let's not confuse them by always been the guy that makes everybody laugh so maybe he wasn't being real serious when he said that to me let's not be the sister always cutting up and carrying on let's put let's not let's not confuse our brother and sister brother raynor says you can be so spiritually minded that you're no earthly good i believe that i'm a long ways from that but maybe we should be more that if we're leaving this earth why do we need to be earthly good let's focus on being spiritually minded let's focus on our purpose and our calling and our position let's not confuse our brother and sister that when we're fellowshipping with them we have two hours of nonsense and now the word the lord drops a word in my heart for you and i've got to convince you that it's from the lord when i just spent two hours of absolute nonsense lord have mercy i'm getting back to my notes what we should give and consideration we should give to the power that we hold in the very words we speak if we really believe we're the bride and we really believe we're the mercy seat and the dispensing of mercy and judgment what thought should we give to our actions and our communications let's not confuse our brother and sister let's encourage them by our words and our actions to make them be comfortable with the fact that we can dispense mercy or judgment let's make them comfortable with that let's not send out confusing signals and i i don't have to i can't preach that as a doctrine i can't stack up a bunch of quotes and nail it into you the holy spirit has to reveal that to each individual the way that you're made your temperament because the scripture says there is a time to laugh there's a time to cry there's a time to mourn there is a time and a place and an order to things and i'm going to get off of this subject by one last thing brother branham says the spirit of america is entertainment and frolic if he's revealed that to us how guarded should we be against that let's not confuse our brothers and sisters if i'm entertainment and frolic one second and i'm the mercy seat the next let's give thought and meditation to that 1963 just once more i promise you i'm coming to a close because all organizations that isn't into this council of churches i got the paper on it that if your church is not in this council of churches in time of trouble in time of trouble trouble can be a lot of things i was talking about this with a brother the other day trouble can be a lot of things it can be a worldwide disease it can be a famine it can be a lot of things but in time of trouble they can use your church to store ammunition or anything that they want to and if any man is caught having a prayer for anybody outside of an affiliation with this council of churches can be shot as a federal offense that's right i got the papers on it from washington you they're going to force you into it two things i just want to point out there real quickly they can use this building for whatever they need to whenever they need to and you can be shot if you don't like it 1963 looking away to jesus there is coming a time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it which was pagan rome when it became papal rome see that this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains it and then after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised all the power the dragon had before him and the dragon is rome always so don't you see roman denomination a mark protestant denomination an image unto the beast making a power that will force all protestants like a union you'll have you'll have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship well it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some event identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all that altogether that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you watch the third pull then see and it'll be absolutely to the total lost but for the bride and the church i want to emphasize one thing here we can all rejoice when he says and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then glory hallelujah wonderful experience look at what's right before it tells you the true church and the fullness of the manifestation of the third pool will be here in the time of a politically backed persecution that originated from this nation 1964 his unfailing words of promise now that great gift others i've tried to explain and say how it was done this can't be explained just wait it will not be in operation so perfectly now wait till that council of churches brings on that persecution that's when it will happen ditto to what i just said about the other quote we will be here at that time it originates out of this nation don't be afraid of that the lamb is in control 1964 god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief but the last thing was to be a great thing would take place we've been watching for it all these years and we all know when it happened first when a creation come into existence the third time and then the fourth time last night i told you the fifth time speaking about the tumor and media and it's waiting for this count it's waiting it's waiting for this council of churches when it unites and the protestants if i speak saturday morning that's what i want to speak on and then when this gets together then the spirit of god always raises a standard against them so you tell me what's got to come first the fullness of the manifestation of the third pool or a politically backed persecution out of this nation do you believe that you're going to demonstrate the fullness of the manifestation of the third pole prior to your atoms changing yes you do that also means that prior to your atoms changing you're going to face a politically backed persecution out of this nation let the prophet preach the doctrine don't try to change it because you regret begrudging your extended stay quit trying to change the atoms of your body thinking that if you pray hard enough or if you fast long enough something will happen it's not going to happen until the word's been fulfilled get on board with the word and the word will lead you when to fast and when to pray and what to fast and what to pray for don't fight a spiritual war carnally 1964 shalom and we all know that's the identification we know what the third poll is we all understand that now you've got you'll have a tape see and i think it'll just lay dormant for a while until the great hour of persecution comes i feel that you're getting my drift so i'm going to move on that's when it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly and now i think just wait see to see what it done 1963 church order and remember god is looking to me to see that i stay in the word and i'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word see in this church and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of darkness the kingdom the dark kingdom of satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the lord and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits your aged soldiers now and been trained to fight and satan will come amongst you cause you to dispute with one another if he can i wonder why he'd want you to do that maybe satan knows where the mercy seat's at maybe he does i'm convinced he does why else would he want you to dispute with one another what's he care what you all do with one with another what what relevance does that make he knows where the scriptures are lined up at and he knows what's coming his way and he will do anything to sort that he's not concerned about the nail scarred corporal body of jesus christ right now what he's concerned about is mrs jesus christ and the form that god has chosen to come in that's why he wants to bring dispute to you and your brother and your sister because he know if he knows if he can drive a wedge in there we're separated from the mercy seat god how else is god going to bring correction saints he's got no mouth but your mouth no feet but my feet no hands but your hands it's the form that he's chosen to use he's got to stick with it he's not going to change the form just because we saw that brother make a mistake two weeks ago it's the form he's chosen to use get on board with it you have to be age soldiers not fresh recruits and we're here to hold a standard in this evening like time and when the world is darkened and the whole church kingdom is going into the council of churches and pretty soon they'll they'll try to attack a sign on this door here closed and then we're going to have to meet other places last time i checked we're still meeting at a church this has not been fulfilled yet don't ask for your atoms to change until it does be in line with the timeline be in line with the timeline because they'll certainly certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast so if we see a politically backed persecution that's not concerned about our church closing we got a big problem moving on 1963 there is a man here that can turn on the light when the persecution comes i wonder why he tell us about a persecution coming if we're not going to be here for it when the persecution comes this is so profound look i'm just going to read it when the persecution comes don't get scared now i really feel like preaching i'm gonna have to make y'all stand up and sit down a couple of times look what he does he ties this right directly back to matthew 26 he knows where he's standing saints he's not just throwing these things out here he knows with this when this comes what conditions were here before so of all things that he could tell us of all things that he could tell us to do when this comes what does he tell us don't get scared it's perfectly in line with the scriptures and the only way that you're going to be able to do what your prophet has commanded you to do is if you are in dedicated prayer consecrated to god so that you have a proper understanding of what time you're in and the word for your hour and when you have those two things by default there will be no fear and again that doesn't mean that it's going to be a pleasant experience and that doesn't mean that your flesh is going to be comfortable you may be terrified in the flesh the flesh doesn't matter what matters is you have no fear in your soul you have no fear in your spirit you know where you're standing and as brother branham says i'm going to come to that day and i'm going to serve him with everything that i have and he looks at me and kicks me into hell i'm going to kiss his bottom of his boots when he's doing it that's the character word to live in when that persecution comes don't get scared there is a light he said he would catch his people away she'll not go through the tribulation she'll never do it he said she wouldn't she'll be caught away how they going to do it brother branham it looks awful dark no matter how dark it gets no matter how dark it gets why would he be emphasizing it's going to get dark if it's not going to get dark these aren't frivolous tape space using words no matter how dark it gets you can't see your hand before you that's pretty dark just remember there is a man here who can turn on the light he'll rapture the church that is the climax rapture that is the atom's changing rapture that is we are no longer in this dimension rapture but before that happens it's going to get dark to where you cannot see your hand before your face take the natural apply it to the spiritual it's going to be a physically physical persecution backed by a political religious force i'm going to have brother franco play this clip real quick as soon as i finish reading the end of it because i want you to hear the inflection and the tone of voice and the emphasis brother branham is laying on this he's not joking around saints he knows what's coming he say he'll rapture that church you say well i'm all right yeah shadrach meshach and abednego were right up to the fiery furnace but there's a man there who can turn on the light i read that with the wrong emphasis so i want to go back he wasn't saying that i'm right as in i'm i'm holy he's saying well i'm right as in i'm right up against something that's that's what he's trying to say there i'm right up against it you say well i'm right yeah shadrach meshach and abednego was right up to the fiery furnace but there's a man there who can turn on the air yes sir that rushing mighty wind that came down on the day of pentecost it turned he turned it on again and fanned the breeze away from them all the fire there was a man there he's called the fourth man there is one here today he's the only one hallelujah he has the light switch in his hand who's in control the man with the light switch if the musicians would come and brother tommy and if brother franco you just play that clip i want uh i just want you all to hear that i'll make a couple real brief comments afterwards and we'll close the service but i want you to hear the emphasis brother random lays on this looking children as i say i'm five minutes past time now let me say this one thing there is a man present don't get scared no matter what they say i've seen it come to the spot before i didn't know where to move next but he's always present the never failing presence he's always there he can turn on the line yes sir he's just waiting see what you're going to do he can flip the switch anytime he wants to yes sir there's a man here that can turn on the lights those who sit in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer some of them under the death of denominations some of them under creed's death some of them under traditional death and all them kinds of death and they have seen a great light the man the flesh the light sin is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light that same god yesterday today and forever he's present today right here now don't get scared he can turn on the lights when the persecution comes don't get scared hallelujah does the light say catch his people away shall not go through the tribulation [Applause] that can turn on the light you're gonna rapture that church you say well i'm right yeah shadrach meshach and abednego is right up to the fiery furnace but there's a man there yes sir that russian mighty wind he come down the day of pentecost he turned it on again and fanned all the breeze away from him all the fire there was a man there he's called the fourth man there's one here today he's the only one he's got the light switch in his hands oh she said in the regions of the shadow of death great light sprung up don't reject it receive it in the name of the law are we our heads yes you can hear the seriousness that he says that with you'll notice he said a couple times just before that about the persecution then he comes back and you can see the anointing change you can hear the anointing change and he comes back and he drives that in he comes back and he clinches that nail don't get scared as we would stand together that is our position saints that is our calling we do not operate out of fear we know where we stand we know what's coming and we're going to conduct ourselves with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring our way politically backed or not it will be will the church be closed it will be will we be an offense will the shepherd be smitten it will be will we be scattered we will be we're not going to change these patterns the only thing we can change is our response to the conditions and i want to leave you with what we started on remember all of that all of that i'm going to say this and this is going to sound harsh but i can't help but say it quit asking for your atoms to change if you're not willing to give all and that goes for me and you and anybody there's a lot of people wanted brother branham's ministry and the power that came with it how many of them were willing to do what he did quit asking for your atoms to change if you haven't given all when you give all and when i give all that goes for me i'm not i'm not pre i know i'm pointing at you but i'm i'm pointing to myself quit asking for something quit asking for a way out quit looking for a way out if you haven't done what the scriptures told us to do because when you do and when i do what he's told us to do that scriptural pattern will not change and look how quickly it processed from one thing giving all let's give all as we would bow our heads precious lord jesus we've been lengthy in time lord just we ask that you would come i feel that the people has got the point of what you've laid on my heart i pray that it was delivered appropriately lord we just ask now that you would come and you would take these words if there's something that's been said wrong or incorrectly we just pray that you would supernaturally correct it in the minds and the ears of the people lord we just want to stand on exactly what your prophet has told us that is coming lord we want to stand and operate with joy of knowing where we're at and not trying to take an easy way out lord we're thankful for truth we are so thankful for truth and to know where we're standing at lord that we don't have to operate in fear but we know who has the switch in his hand and we know who we who we belong to lord i pray that you would just come and each and and every individual myself included and i pray that you would let us manifest that which you need to process your kingdom coming and that is for us to give a complete and total surrender and preeminence to you lord may we all just completely die out to your ways and your word and your spirit here this morning may we have a spirit of repentance and humbleness and no pride whatsoever that you can come and do with us that which you would do in whatever form you have chosen to do it with may we be yielded to you lord we thank you once again for truth we worship you and we praise your name and we're thankful lord we are thankful that somehow that we don't understand but in your great sovereign mind and will you chose us to be the ones to bring the final blow to the final age to literally put death under our feet lord we we don't understand how that works but we are thankful that we are the ones that get this opportunity that all the other christians longed for in days prior we thank you for that no doubt it will be difficult lord but we still thank you that we're the ones that get to leave with that testimony we worship you this morning we pray your blessings on the people we pray your blessings on the pastor we ask that you would just have your perfect will in all things and cement us lord with your love in jesus christ's name we pray amen according to your promises [Music] can you still sing that after the quotes that were read why is it that this is heavy this is a heavy this is a heavy service these are heavy things why is that there's a witness in your heart that says it's true and it's timely i mean most people would be afraid intimidated timid but although we there's some anxiety we don't know what will happen next we know what it will look like we don't know how much suffering there will be we don't know how much pressure will be but something inside says i was made for this hour you know why because before you come to earth in a state of spiritual amnesia you already knew this was what you were coming to you just come into spiritual amnesia and forgot but it's already played out in the mind of god and you were there amen and you already knew this would happen and now you're coming down here and the word is breaking away spiritual amnesia and there's something very familiar down deep inside of you that can relate to what's being preached there will be people god has ordained to be here his seed genes his people his attributes that will be here to overcome all of those things and if you're one of them you could count yourself one of the most privileged people that have ever walked the face of the earth because you've been ordained and you've been placed and you've been called to a glorious stand say god help me help me die to myself i love the woman with the alabaster box she gave up everything but there was a two other church members one time in the new testament church called ananias and sapphira they were in the church they were part of the church they probably were part of the fellowships they probably were invited over to people's homes they probably had part of the services but ananias and sapphira didn't give everything they held some back and they died this matters it matters that we give everything there's been too much ananias and sapphira i'll give my tithe amen and i'll go to sunday and wednesday but i'm not giving all i'm not giving up my favorite entertainment or my favorite program or my favorite vice or my favorite complex but that ananias fire died and the bride will die spiritually unless she's willing to give everything i want to be identified with the little woman of bad reputation bad reputation bad living bad everything but when it counted amen that seat on the inside came through with the right action in the right time and she was willing she had no reputation so she had nothing to lose oh praise god let us come to a place where we have no reputation so we have nothing to lose let's just die right now let's just choose humility let's just choose death let's just choose to say you know what i am nothing amen nothing about me is special amen the only thing that's special whatever part is him and i want to die to everything else praise be to god don't be afraid but you've seen temporarily you'll see manifest in the fullness of its power don't be afraid amen god bless you i was thinking i've been meditating on the thing where the the part of the sermon where brother branham was preaching that time and brother way fell over dead just been on my mind over the last few days brother way fell over dead and brother ben said the people got nervous and they started to scream and they started talking and brother ben says you've been taught better than that you're a better trained people than that i mean the man fell dead and you know us in our carnal mind we wouldn't fault anybody for squealing or saying oh our lord jesus help us amen but brother brennan was rebuking the whole congregation he said you should be more mature than that you've been taught better than that you've been better trained than that amen when some of these things begin to happen and brother brother so-and-so is taken away we can't find this one you've been better trained than that you know what's happening amen you know what's coming it is not time to be fearful it's not time to run around amen like a chicken with no head the head ship has come we're eagles not chickens under the headship of mama eagle there's no reason to be afraid or run around or let anxiety take us over amen we've got to resist those spirits we ought to be better trained people than that we got to have better training what has god been doing over the last 50 some years training his bride for that final stand and she's going to make it and i just want to be one of them god bless you amen little tell us i want you going around back and get ready amen i'm going to enjoy baptizing our young brother god is still stirring god is still drawing god is still positionally placing all of his people no matter what age gender class god is still calling little telus just wants to be a christian and he loves the lord and he wants to obey and be baptized in his name and he's fervent this is what he wants and his daddy's watched his life and knows that it's real it's a real desire and it's really coming from the heart and it's with joy that we as a church get to observe our brother obey at a young age the word of the lord and we believe that god will do everything that he promised to do for this young man if we if he repents as baptized in the name of lord jesus christ he will fill him with the baptism the holy ghost for that promise comes to this time as many as the lord shall call and god just called him so it's still available now amen tell us because you love the lord jesus christ and you want to obey him and obey his word i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ dear heavenly father i lay hands lord on this boy but god there is no age in eternity and no age to a seed gene and god you are so fit to call him at this time and there's something in him to respond i pray god is he's been obedient and we've kept the word i pray that you would keep your word and fill him with the baptism of the holy ghost let this seed come to life may he never know what it's like to stray away from the path to move to the world but may he always follow after you with all of his heart and all of his life shield him and protect him and use him as a bright shining light in this dark world we love your god we give you glory and honor and praise in jesus christ's name amen love the lord with all your souls oh you shall love the lord with all your mind with all your soul with all your mind the lord all the things oh lord i love you for all the things you want lord i love you for all the things help me love you more one more time with foreign of the lord now be separated yes i was born to be a dwelling place a home for the presence of my lord let my life now be [Music] place a home for the presence of the lord let my life that i might be but i was born amazing grace [Music] like me oh i once was lost but now i found was blind but now i see was grace who was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears really how praise that grace [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you [Music] [Music]
