[6:42] [Music]
[6:44] It's hard to take the first step when I
[6:48] don't know the way.
[6:52] Each turn is so uncertain.
[6:55] But I learn to walk by faith.
[7:00] You gave me a promise
[7:03] and you would never leave.

[7:50] I never need to fear.
[7:54] For though at times I feel alone, I know
[7:59] that you are near.

[8:36] I will answer.
[8:40] Lead me Lord and I
[8:44] will go.
[8:48] Amen. and God bless you this evening.
[8:49] Let's bow our heads together.
[8:53] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God,
[8:55] that you've brought us together. And I'm
[8:57] so thankful, Lord, that there's such a
[8:59] love in our hearts that wants to cry out
[9:01] to you and tell you that we love you,
[9:03] Lord. You're so wonderful. And we so
[9:06] appreciate your goodness to us, Lord,
[9:08] and how you've gathered us together once
[9:10] again to speak to us, Lord. I pray now
[9:13] that you give us ears to hear, Lord, all
[9:15] that you have for us. give us a heart to
[9:17] perceive and may the words that you
[9:19] speak to us have an effect in our lives.
[9:21] May it go deep into our souls and take
[9:23] root there and may it grow and produce
[9:26] fruit, Lord, back to you that we could
[9:28] surrender to your word and surrender our
[9:30] lives to your word. And may your word,
[9:32] Lord, become a life inside of us. May it
[9:35] come to a manifestation in each of us.
[9:38] Take this vessel of mine under your
[9:39] control and speak your eternal words to
[9:41] these lips. For we're depending upon you
[9:44] and trusting in you that you will do
[9:46] what you promised to do for the
[9:48] preaching of the gospel, for the saving
[9:50] of the soul. And may you come and Lord
[9:52] and use this method to heal us, to
[9:55] restore us, to bring us back to what you
[9:58] always wanted us to be, back in
[9:59] fellowship with you, back in union with
[10:01] you, back with you as our father, back
[10:03] with you as our husband, back to that
[10:06] perfect place. We love you. We ask your
[10:09] blessing upon all we say and do tonight.
[10:11] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[10:15] Amen. God bless you. Amen. While we're
[10:17] standing, if you'd like to take your
[10:19] Bibles, we'll turn to the Gospel of
[10:20] John, chapter 20. Say it's good to be
[10:23] together. As you saw, we had a little
[10:25] power flash, but praise God, the power's
[10:27] back on. Amen. Amen. It's amazing. We've
[10:31] had we've we've preached a service here
[10:33] before. I didn't preach it, but um
[10:35] another brother did when the power was
[10:36] out. Praise God. It was a good service.
[10:38] Anyhow, we enjoyed it. So, but we thank
[10:40] God for the lights being on. You can
[10:42] still hear the thunders rolling. Uh, one
[10:44] of the deacons come and informed me that
[10:46] on Stewart Road out here, just to the
[10:48] north of us, there's a tree down and
[10:50] power lines across the road. So, as you
[10:52] go to leave, if you go north on Steuart,
[10:54] if the end of the driveway, if you turn
[10:55] left, that's north. Then you might want
[10:58] to check before you go. You might have
[11:00] to go the other way around. So, thank
[11:02] God that we've got power, especially
[11:04] with that happening. Amen. Also, we have
[11:06] a visitor with us today, visiting from
[11:08] Germany. Brother Aaron Lang. God bless
[11:10] you, brother Aaron. He's here visiting,
[11:12] staying with the Golden family. He
[11:15] attends brother Andreas's church. And he
[11:17] met Brother Steve and sister Nette and
[11:20] sister Nita while their last visit
[11:21] there. And uh brother Steve invited him.
[11:24] He decided to take him up on the
[11:25] invitation. So, God bless you. He'll be
[11:27] with us for three weeks. Amen. So,
[11:29] hopefully you get a chance to meet him.
[11:31] Amen. While we're standing, let's look
[11:32] at John chap 20 verse 17.
[11:37] John chapter 20 verse 17.
[11:42] Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not, for
[11:45] I'm not yet ascended to my father, but
[11:48] go to my brethren and say unto them, I
[11:50] ascended to my father and your father
[11:53] and to my God and your God." Amen. Let's
[11:57] turn back to um Genesis chapter 1.
[12:01] Pick up one more scripture here. Genesis
[12:04] chapter 1
[12:08] verse 26.
[12:12] Genesis chapter 1 26 says, "And God
[12:15] said, let us make man in our image,
[12:17] after our likeness, and let them have
[12:19] dominion over the fish of the sea, and
[12:20] over the fowl of the air, and over the
[12:22] cattle, and over all the earth, and over
[12:24] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[12:25] the earth." So God created man in his
[12:28] own image, and the image of God created
[12:30] he him. Male and female created he them.
[12:33] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[12:35] them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[12:37] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[12:39] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[12:41] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[12:42] every living thing that moveth upon the
[12:44] earth." And God said, "Behold, I have
[12:47] given you every herb bearing seed, which
[12:49] is upon the face of the earth, and every
[12:50] tree, and which is fruit of the tree,
[12:52] yielding seed to you. it shall be for
[12:55] meat. Amen. God bless you as you have
[12:57] your seats. Uh I want to uh take a look
[13:01] here as as we started with John 20:1 17
[13:05] where Jesus says, "I go unto my father
[13:09] and your father." We spoke about this
[13:11] last service on Sunday, but I want to go
[13:14] I I want to continue on with that same
[13:16] theme. But how thankful I am that Jesus
[13:18] said these words, I go to my father and
[13:21] your father. Amen. It's so good to have
[13:23] a father and know who our heavenly
[13:25] father is because with him with God as
[13:27] our father everything's under control
[13:29] when he says I go to my God and your
[13:31] God. So Jesus wasn't just taking that
[13:34] position himself he was sharing it with
[13:35] his brethren. Amen. And recognizing his
[13:37] brethren in the resurrection. So brother
[13:40] Frank if we could pull up it is up.
[13:41] Okay. So I want to speak on the subject
[13:44] parenthood originated in God. So we go
[13:47] to Genesis 1 and we look at Genesis 1.
[13:49] God wanted to create man in his image in
[13:51] his likeness made him man made them male
[13:54] and female and and the Bible tells us
[13:56] that that Adam was a son of God. So God
[14:01] had created a son. He had given he
[14:03] brought forth a son and that son upon
[14:05] the earth was Adam. That was his child.
[14:07] And and and God was a a a father. If we
[14:11] go here to this first slide and look at
[14:13] what brother Brandham says in the
[14:15] conflict between God and Satan, he said,
[14:18] "Would not you tonight to your children
[14:19] that was helpless little fellows who
[14:22] can't take care of themselves, don't you
[14:23] struggle and work and do everything that
[14:25] you can to provide the best that you can
[14:27] or able or to provide for those children
[14:30] because you are a father, a parent. And
[14:32] if that be what what I would say the
[14:34] truess and the thought of an earthly
[14:36] parent and parenthood originated in God
[14:39] because he was the first parent. This is
[14:41] where we got our title. Parenthood
[14:43] originated in God. So if we find
[14:45] ourselves as a parent tonight,
[14:47] parenthood originated in God. So we want
[14:50] to find our example. We look to God.
[14:52] He's the example for all things because
[14:54] parenthood originated in God.
[14:58] And Christ's mystery of God revealed. He
[15:00] says, "But what he wanted to do, he
[15:01] loved fatherhood, for he was a father,
[15:04] and the only way that he could express
[15:05] it was to become son of man." So,
[15:07] brother Ram is starting to explain to us
[15:09] these attributes that were locked in
[15:11] God. And God wanted to express himself,
[15:14] what was in his thinking, what he was a
[15:17] as as as a being, he wanted to express
[15:19] that to be known, to be made manifest.
[15:22] And in him was to be a father. He loved
[15:24] fatherhood. And in order to express
[15:26] himself as a father, he had to create a
[15:28] son. He had to become a son, as son of
[15:30] man. And that was the expressing the
[15:32] fatherhood of God. So God is our father.
[15:37] Praise God. And parenthood originated in
[15:40] God. Praise be to God. So let's go to
[15:45] this next quote here in Pergamian
[15:47] Church. He said, "The first son, Adam,
[15:48] was the spoken seed word of God. He was
[15:51] given a bride to reproduce himself.
[15:54] That's why the bride was given to him to
[15:56] reproduce himself to produce another son
[15:59] of God." So, we went over this last
[16:01] time, but I'd like to labor on this a
[16:02] little bit longer uh tonight.
[16:05] God God reproduced a son. He produced a
[16:09] son, and that son was Adam on the earth.
[16:11] And Adam was a reflection of God. He was
[16:14] he was made God over the earth to rule
[16:16] and reign over God's creation. And he
[16:18] placed him there as such and told him to
[16:20] take dominion and told him to re reign
[16:22] and told him to to reproduce himself to
[16:24] replenish the earth. And when God saw
[16:26] that Adam was alone, he said, "It's not
[16:28] good that man should be alone." So he
[16:30] laid him down and he took a rib and from
[16:32] the rib he made him a help meat. And
[16:34] that help meat was his wife. Amen. And
[16:36] he brought the two together. And and to
[16:39] God that was not Amen. Those were not
[16:41] two separate beings. Although they lived
[16:43] in two separate vessels, but to him that
[16:45] was just a furtherance of Adam. That was
[16:48] Adam now and male and Adam now and
[16:50] female. Because he created them male and
[16:52] female and called their name Adam. This
[16:54] is Genesis chapter 5. So God gave Adam
[17:00] a bride to reproduce himself. So in the
[17:04] original parent God, God was singular.
[17:07] And in him was everything that was
[17:10] needed, amen, to reproduce himself. And
[17:12] God, that's what God wanted to do. He
[17:14] wanted to to bring something forth that
[17:16] reflected him, that was in his image, in
[17:18] his reflection. Amen. that would would
[17:20] that he could place upon the earth that
[17:22] he could reveal himself to that he could
[17:23] have fellowship with. Amen. And that's
[17:25] what he was doing with his children.
[17:26] That was his original intent. He wanted
[17:28] to dwell together with his family with
[17:31] his attributes as a family of God upon
[17:33] the earth in flesh tangible.
[17:37] That's what God wanted in order to God
[17:39] to bring this forth. Now, he took
[17:40] everything that he placed in Adam and
[17:42] Adam was both male and female. And now
[17:45] in order for God to do this, he splits
[17:47] the feminish out of Adam and puts that
[17:49] in the woman and brings the two back
[17:51] together. And now God's going to use two
[17:53] vessels with a split spirit,
[17:56] one masculine and one feminist. And God
[17:59] is now going to show now through this
[18:01] God is going to show fatherhood and
[18:03] motherhood.
[18:05] So where was motherhood before? In God.
[18:08] Amen. Where was fatherhood before? It
[18:10] was in God. It was all in God. And now
[18:12] God wants to display it. and into this
[18:14] display. This is all of God's choosing.
[18:17] All the way God wants to display
[18:18] himself. So he wants to split the
[18:20] masculine and feminist that was bound up
[18:22] in him to display motherhood and
[18:25] fatherhood.
[18:27] So parenthood originated in God.
[18:31] In the message leadership, Brother Venom
[18:34] says it's usually a mother that gets to
[18:36] lead a child to its first step cuz she's
[18:40] home while daddy is out working trying
[18:42] to make a living. But it's they they
[18:44] make their first step and at night time
[18:46] when they come in the father he's always
[18:48] saying oh dad she said Johnny and Mary
[18:50] the little boy or girl could walk come
[18:52] and look and just one step maybe mother
[18:54] had to hold and had to hold mother's
[18:56] finger cuz you was kind of weak and kind
[18:59] of turned sideways you know and fall
[19:01] down a little so you had to hold the
[19:02] mama's hand to make your first step and
[19:04] brother Bam's starting to just explain
[19:06] the simplicity of life the natural life
[19:08] that we see all around and showing us in
[19:11] the message leadership ship. How when
[19:13] you first come to this earth, your first
[19:15] leader is mother. The first one you
[19:17] contact is mother. The first one to show
[19:19] you love is mother. And what is mother
[19:21] doing? Amen. If she's the right kind of
[19:23] mother, mother is your first contact and
[19:27] impression with God.
[19:30] The right kind of mother is what she
[19:32] what is she here to display? She's here
[19:34] to display motherhood. Where did
[19:35] motherhood originate? In God. So what is
[19:38] she here to do? She's here to give you
[19:40] your first picture of God.
[19:45] Of unconditional love, of unmmerited
[19:48] favor,
[19:50] Hey, listen. That little baby didn't do
[19:52] a thing to earn that mother's love.
[19:54] Amen. It didn't do anything right.
[19:55] Didn't say anything right. Didn't I
[19:57] mean, of course, the mother thinks this
[19:58] thing's never done anything wrong, but
[19:59] it also didn't do anything right. Amen.
[20:02] It hasn't made a mistake yet, of course,
[20:04] but it hasn't done anything right. It
[20:06] hasn't done anything to earn that love.
[20:08] It's just the very just the very fact
[20:11] that this life come from me has a
[20:13] mother's absolute devotion and
[20:15] unconditional love. And what is that?
[20:17] That's a picture of God's love for his
[20:19] children.
[20:22] Then that mother will take that baby and
[20:25] hold it to her. Amen. And she she's the
[20:27] one who carried this child. Amen. For
[20:30] for so long. She she gave birth to this
[20:32] child and now she's going to nurture it.
[20:34] She's going to care for it. And this
[20:35] child has nothing that it can do for
[20:37] itself. It is getting absolute all
[20:40] nourishment, all love, all care, all
[20:42] cleaning. Everything's coming from
[20:44] mother.
[20:46] And it doesn't mean that dad's not
[20:47] helping dad.
[20:50] But really, dad's insufficient compared
[20:52] to mom. Because she has the attribute of
[20:55] mother locked in the feminine nature.
[20:58] And so, she is giving this child its
[21:01] first glimpse or contact of God.
[21:06] Amen. This is this is so wonderful and
[21:10] so terrible at the same time. And the
[21:13] reason it's so wonderful and so terrible
[21:14] is because the fall in the Garden of
[21:16] Eden has brought a perversion and a
[21:18] corruption. And and there's so many
[21:20] things now that go wrong in life to
[21:22] where now the very thing that was
[21:24] supposed to be life to a child, amen,
[21:27] can become damaging. and and the fact
[21:29] that there could be a neglecting mother.
[21:30] There could be a mother that dies in
[21:32] childbirth. There could be things that
[21:33] go wrong and start to corrupt what God
[21:36] intended to be perfect.
[21:38] And so, so we can see what God designed,
[21:42] desired, and now we can see what Satan
[21:45] has perverted. And he's trying to
[21:47] corrupt by the very thing been trying to
[21:49] damage by the very thing God sent to be
[21:52] love to be grace to be unmmerited favor
[21:56] to be unconditional love to be
[21:59] lifegiving life sustaining love and so
[22:03] when we if we all of us who had good
[22:05] mothers we thank God for our mothers
[22:06] because this is the picture that they
[22:08] begin to paint for us of love.
[22:12] Amen.
[22:14] In Genesis 17 when God speaks to
[22:17] Abraham, he said, 'When Abraham was 90
[22:19] years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
[22:21] Abraham and said unto him, I am the
[22:23] Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou
[22:25] perfect. And this phrase almighty God
[22:28] means El Shadai. And Elshadai in in the
[22:32] Hebrew means the breasted God. God is
[22:34] showing himself in female form in a
[22:37] picture of a mother who's giving life,
[22:40] strength, nourishment to to a baby. And
[22:43] this is what he's saying to Abraham
[22:44] because Abraham is already 90 years old.
[22:46] His life stream is dried up. He's not
[22:49] able to produce a son anymore. He's in
[22:52] weakness. Amen. That the Bible says he
[22:54] was the Bible says he was as good as
[22:56] dead. That's what the Bible says. He was
[22:59] as good as dead. But God now comes and
[23:01] presents himself to Abraham as a
[23:03] nourisher and a lifegiver. I am. And
[23:05] when he when he when he presents himself
[23:07] this way to Abraham, he said, "I am El
[23:09] Shadai, the breasted God. you can come
[23:12] and nurse your strength from me. There's
[23:14] renewing power. There's lifegiving
[23:16] power. There's strength that can come
[23:17] from me. This is what the prophet says
[23:20] about that. Now, just like Abraham when
[23:22] he was 90 and 9 years old, I believe in
[23:25] Genesis 17, God appeared to this old man
[23:28] now 99 years old when he was almost 100
[23:31] years old that had been waiting upon
[23:34] that promise all these years. He
[23:35] appeared to him in the name of Elshadai,
[23:38] the breasted one. And what an
[23:40] encouragement it was. Yet the promise
[23:41] wasn't fulfilled then. But Abraham, I am
[23:44] the almighty God, Elshadai, the
[23:46] strengthgiver, the breasted God. Like
[23:49] I've told you before, like the little
[23:50] baby that's fretting and sick and
[23:52] crying, and it lays upon its mother's
[23:54] breast and nurses its strength back from
[23:56] her because it's satisfied while it's a
[23:58] nursing because the only access it has
[24:01] and knows of is a mother's breast. It
[24:03] knows the no dose of medicine. You might
[24:05] give him a dose of medicine, he'd squeal
[24:06] and cry. Give him a shot in the arm and
[24:08] he'd carry on. But the only access to
[24:10] satisfy him is the mother's breast. So
[24:13] this is how God pictures himself to
[24:15] Abraham. Abraham, I'm like a mother and
[24:19] you're weak and and you don't have
[24:20] strength, but you can get strength from
[24:22] me. And God is still El Shadai. He's
[24:26] still Amen. All the qualities he ever
[24:28] had, he's never lost. Amen. He's still a
[24:30] mother. He's still a father. He's still
[24:32] a savior. Amen. He's still a husband.
[24:34] He's still everything he ever was. He is
[24:36] whatever we have need of in the hour we
[24:37] have need of it. He's that to supply
[24:40] that need. When we're weak and have no
[24:42] strength in fredding, we can receive
[24:44] strength from him.
[24:46] Amen. He goes on to show us this
[24:49] feminine attribute of God. In Galatians
[24:51] 4, he says, "But Jerusalem, which is
[24:53] above, is free, which is mother of us
[24:56] all." Now, it's starting to show the
[24:58] heavenly Jerusalem, the the city of God,
[25:00] is the mother of us all. And so he keeps
[25:04] using this terminology, this picture to
[25:06] show us, amen, that that God is mother
[25:09] and God is father.
[25:11] And the message thirst, he says, notice
[25:13] Jerusalem, the word Jerusalem is from
[25:15] above. The Bible said which is mother of
[25:18] us all and Christ is our mother. We
[25:21] realize that God is our mother for we
[25:23] are born of him. Where do we come forth
[25:26] from? We come forth from God. God is the
[25:28] originator. God is the seedgiver. But
[25:30] God is also the one that brought us
[25:32] forth. Amen. Which means God is father
[25:34] and God is mother.
[25:37] Amen. The word simply means peace.
[25:39] Jerusalem shalom or shalom which means
[25:41] peace.
[25:42] It says in Revelation 21:2, "And John
[25:45] saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
[25:47] down from God out of heaven prepared as
[25:50] a bride adorned for her husband."
[25:52] Further down in the same chapter, then
[25:54] in verse 9, it says, "And there came
[25:56] unto me one of the seven angels, which
[25:58] had the seven vials full of the seven
[25:59] last plagues, and talked with me,
[26:01] saying, Come hither, I will show thee
[26:03] the bride, the lamb's wife. And he
[26:05] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[26:07] and high mountain, and showed me the
[26:09] great city, the holy Jerusalem,
[26:11] descending out of heaven from God." Now,
[26:14] this new Jerusalem, this heavenly
[26:16] Jerusalem, is the mother of us all. But
[26:19] now this new Jerusalem is the bride.
[26:23] Amen. Which means God and his attribute
[26:25] of mother. Amen. Attribute of feminine.
[26:28] Now he's going to show it through his
[26:30] bride. Amen. It's still Christ. It's
[26:32] still God. It's not human beings. But
[26:34] it's God dwelling in his people showing
[26:37] himself in this new Jerusalem as bride
[26:40] which is feminine which is the lamb's
[26:41] wife. Amen.
[26:45] in the invisible union.
[26:47] Uh he says, "So you see, she's
[26:49] pregnantated with something." He's
[26:51] talking of the end time church here.
[26:53] He's speaking of of the nominal church
[26:54] or the false church. She's pregnantated
[26:56] with something because she's bringing
[26:57] forth members all the time. See how God
[27:00] is now showing this feminine type now in
[27:03] a church. Amen. It doesn't change that
[27:06] God is the mother. God is the feminine.
[27:09] But now he's showing it where? He's
[27:11] showing it in the church. Amen. Amen.
[27:15] But uh she's bringing forth members all
[27:18] the time, but she don't want none of
[27:19] them screaming, hollering, blabbering,
[27:21] Acts 2:38, miserable creatures that she
[27:24] thinks they are. Amen. That's the kind I
[27:25] want to be. Amen. I want to be that kind
[27:28] that says, "Amen." when you hear the
[27:29] word. That gets really excited when you
[27:31] hear the word. Brother Venom, when he
[27:33] saw God in nature, he went running and
[27:35] running and running around. That's the
[27:36] kind I want to be. That gets enthused
[27:38] about the things of God. That gets
[27:39] excited when we hear the word. that'll
[27:41] say amen to the word of God almost
[27:44] involuntary when it pops out of your
[27:45] mouth. Say, "Praise God. That's the kind
[27:48] I want to be." Amen. Acts 2:38.
[27:50] Miserable creatures that she thinks they
[27:52] are. It would certainly embarrass her.
[27:54] It would ruin her educated, ethical,
[27:57] scientific, so society church that she
[27:59] belongs to here. They would throw her
[28:01] out at the next council. She can't have
[28:03] it. She don't want to be pregnant with
[28:05] the word because that's the only kind
[28:07] that the word can bring forth. The word
[28:10] is male. The church is female. Amen. The
[28:13] word is the progeniator of life or the
[28:15] seed, the giver of life. Amen. The
[28:17] church is what can become pregnantated
[28:19] and bring forth that life to manifest
[28:21] the life of Christ.
[28:23] Born of the spirit of God. It has the
[28:25] spirit of God in it. No intellectual
[28:27] church joining and creedgoing, bobbed
[28:29] hair, painted face. There's no such a
[28:31] thing as that in all of it. You don't
[28:33] find that in the word of God. You find
[28:35] an old-fashioned sanctified Holy
[28:37] Ghostfilled child born of the spirit of
[28:40] God screaming, hollering, shouting,
[28:42] praising God. Amen. Amen. So, Brother
[28:46] Benham is telling us that that there's
[28:49] uh there's a female nature to God that
[28:52] there there's God the motherhood
[28:54] originated God and he's showing that and
[28:56] now the church, amen, is bringing forth
[28:58] all the time. She's pregnantated on the
[29:00] word and she's bringing forth. Some are
[29:02] bringing forth church members. Some are
[29:03] bringing forth sons and daughters of
[29:05] God. So it means the church has a role
[29:08] in what the work that God is doing at
[29:10] the end time. Just like Adam's wife had
[29:12] a role. She had a role to play. And what
[29:15] was her role? To help Adam reproduce
[29:18] himself. And what is the role of the
[29:19] bride in the end time? To help Christ,
[29:21] the son of man, reproduce himself on the
[29:23] earth. And a many membered bride. Amen.
[29:27] So the bride has been given to Christ
[29:29] for the same reason the bride was given
[29:31] to Adam. so that he can reproduce
[29:33] himself upon the earth. He's doing that
[29:35] in a many membered bride. So that means
[29:37] we as a church have a role to play.
[29:41] Amen. We talked about it a little bit
[29:42] last time. That role to play is nurture
[29:45] and and and and the one who gives love
[29:48] and care and nurture and support and
[29:50] strength and all of that. Amen. But the
[29:52] one thing that we cannot do is play the
[29:53] role of the father. So we'll talk about
[29:56] that more as we go on.
[29:59] Brother Ram says in Abraham's covenant
[30:01] confirmed he says you notice said the
[30:04] Bible the 12th chapter the woman in the
[30:06] 12th chapter of revelations the moon was
[30:09] under their foot feet the sun at her
[30:10] head showing the law fading out as soon
[30:13] as the sun rises the moon goes down the
[30:16] moon is a wife to the sun oh I love that
[30:19] kind of Bible reading brother Brandham's
[30:21] showing the typology in Revelation 12 uh
[30:25] of the moon typing the church amen and
[30:28] the son typing Christ and then he makes
[30:30] a statement. I love that kind of Bible
[30:32] reading. Question is, do you love that
[30:34] kind of Bible reading? Amen. The sun and
[30:37] the moon is a type of Christ in the
[30:39] church. When the sun goes down, out of
[30:42] sight, it's not down. It's just out of
[30:43] sight to the world. It reflects its
[30:45] light back to the moon to give light in
[30:47] its absence. Amen. So, so the brother
[30:52] I'm showing us in the na in the nature
[30:54] the type of nature that the sun and the
[30:56] moon is type of husband and wife and the
[30:58] moon is a type of the church that shines
[31:01] the light of Christ Jesus Christ in the
[31:03] absence of Christ. Amen. Now that his
[31:05] death, burial, and resurrection and
[31:07] ascension has take place. Now he's
[31:08] shining his light upon the church and
[31:10] the church is reflecting the light of
[31:12] Christ back into the earth. That's the
[31:14] role that she's playing. But she's never
[31:16] competing with the sun.
[31:19] She's got a different role to play.
[31:21] She's not the sun. She's not the
[31:22] replacement of the sun. She's only the
[31:24] reflector of the sun. It's so important
[31:27] to know because this works for Christ
[31:29] and his bride. It works for the sun and
[31:31] the moon. But it also works for mom and
[31:33] dad in a home. So you can take the
[31:36] lessons that God gives us in nature, the
[31:38] lessons he gives us in his Bible, the
[31:40] lessons of his own nature, and he could
[31:42] bring it all the way down to our home to
[31:44] teach us how to live in our own homes as
[31:46] a mother and a father. Because what are
[31:48] what are we supposed to be doing as a
[31:50] mother and father in our home? We're
[31:52] supposed to be reflecting God to our
[31:54] children.
[31:56] They're supposed to come in contact with
[31:58] God through us.
[32:02] Amen. So the moon is is never in
[32:05] competition with the sun.
[32:08] In fact, the moon really has no light of
[32:11] its own.
[32:13] All of its light is coming from the sun
[32:16] because the church really has no light
[32:18] of its own. The light is coming from
[32:20] Christ. It's coming from the sun. It's
[32:22] coming from the illumination of the
[32:24] manifested word. That's what's shining
[32:26] off of our lives. It's not our light.
[32:28] It's his light shining through us.
[32:32] So now we realize the role that we're
[32:33] playing. Amen. But but what happens?
[32:36] Amen. When the moon gets between the
[32:38] earth and the sun, Amen, that's called
[32:40] an eclipse. Remember last year when we
[32:42] had eclipse
[32:44] when the moon moved in front of the sun
[32:46] and blocked out the light of the sun.
[32:48] Amen. That amen. That shows the negative
[32:51] role of the moon. When the moon wants to
[32:53] take the place of the sun and stand in
[32:55] the place of the sun, it becomes
[32:56] darkness. Now now the the moon's not
[33:00] even shining or reflecting any light.
[33:02] Everything becomes dark because now the
[33:04] moon wants to position itself in front
[33:07] of the sun. Amen. and become the supreme
[33:10] being in the sky so all the earth can
[33:12] only see her.
[33:15] And this is what the false church has
[33:17] done. The false church has shaded out
[33:19] Christ. Amen. They become the the word.
[33:21] They become the law. They want to become
[33:23] all in all. So that you have to look to
[33:25] the church for everything. You look to
[33:26] the church for salvation. You look to
[33:28] the church for everything that you get
[33:30] you get from the church. And that's what
[33:31] the church has wanted.
[33:34] Right? And now instead of reflecting
[33:35] light, all has become darkness. That's
[33:37] right. Amen. That's right.
[33:41] When if she would have just stayed in
[33:42] her place, she had a beautiful place to
[33:44] play. She was shining light. Not her own
[33:47] light, but Christ light, real light,
[33:50] true light, lifegiving light. The light
[33:53] of day was now coming through her and
[33:55] reflecting back to the earth through
[33:57] her.
[33:58] Amen. That was the role that we're
[34:01] supposed to play. That was the role the
[34:02] church was supposed to play, but it got
[34:04] in the way. You remember you you know
[34:07] sometimes you can see the sun and the
[34:08] moon in the sky at the same time. You've
[34:10] ever seen that? Amen. And that's
[34:12] beautiful because there's no
[34:13] competition. There's no blocking. But
[34:15] you can see the brightness of the sun
[34:16] and then you can see the brightness of
[34:18] the moon and you can see husband and
[34:19] wife, father and mother in the same sky
[34:22] and no competition with one another but
[34:24] in perfect harmony.
[34:26] And they're both beautiful and they're
[34:27] both in position. But the same thing
[34:29] that holds true for the sky and the same
[34:31] thing that holds true for the church
[34:32] holds true in our homes.
[34:35] If mother, amen, wants to take a
[34:37] dominant position over father, it's
[34:40] going to bring darkness into our
[34:42] families
[34:43] because that's that's marring the
[34:46] picture that God is trying to paint for
[34:48] all of us. God has set up and structured
[34:51] everything to try to reflect his nature,
[34:53] try to reflect his own person. Amen. And
[34:56] now God has called a man to be the
[34:58] leader of the home. He's one, he's the
[35:00] one that brings illumination and light
[35:02] into his family. And mom is there to
[35:04] help him with that. And she's there to
[35:06] shine the light. Like brother like
[35:09] brother Bam said, mom's there. When
[35:10] dad's off at work. Yeah. So when dad's
[35:13] off at work, what's mom doing? She's
[35:16] reflecting back the light from dad. The
[35:18] leadership of dad, the direction of dad,
[35:20] the guidance from dad is coming off of
[35:22] mom into the home. But you know what
[35:25] becomes really really deadly is when she
[35:29] doesn't give a true reflection of the
[35:30] light. But she wants to have her own
[35:34] light when dad's gone.
[35:38] This is this is this is what's been
[35:39] dangerous in the church. And this is
[35:41] what dangerous at home. Amen. When when
[35:44] the absence of dad when dad's at work or
[35:46] dad's off. Amen. the best thing that mom
[35:49] could ever do for her children. And this
[35:52] is not just for raising toddlers. This
[35:55] is for teaching your children about God.
[35:57] Amen. That's right. It's not for raising
[35:59] toddlers. It's teaching your children
[36:01] about God. The principles of God are so
[36:03] sound and so sure and they work so good
[36:06] if we stay in our parameters. Yeah. When
[36:10] that little tight comes running up to
[36:12] mom and says, "Mom, can we xyz? Can we
[36:15] do this?" and she says, "No, remember
[36:18] dad said." Dad says, "No, we can't do
[36:21] that." Or she says, "Yes." Dad says,
[36:24] "That's fine." Or, "Yes, that's okay,
[36:26] honey. Daddy told us." What she's doing
[36:29] is she's setting that child up to
[36:31] receive from God. Yeah. You may not
[36:33] think so, but that's exactly what's
[36:35] happening. Amen. by the way we operate
[36:37] in our homes. We're we're setting we're
[36:39] establishing an understanding in
[36:42] toddlers who can't understand the deep
[36:44] mysteries of God, but we're
[36:45] demonstrating them to them at a young
[36:47] age. And they're beginning to recognize
[36:49] that everything goes back to the father.
[36:52] Every instruction, every lesson,
[36:54] everything goes back to the father.
[36:55] Amen. It doesn't stop at mom. Mom's not
[36:58] the lawgiver. Mom's not the lightgiver.
[37:00] Mom's a reflector of dad's law and dad's
[37:02] light. Amen. to bring it back to the
[37:04] children and to nurture and to care for
[37:05] and to protect and to love and to help
[37:08] grow.
[37:10] And when we get it when we when we do it
[37:12] according to God's way, amen, it begins
[37:14] to set everything in motion the right
[37:17] way. But when we pervert it from the
[37:19] beginning, we're actually setting
[37:21] stumbling stones before our children and
[37:23] don't even realize it.
[37:25] Because what happens is say say mom
[37:29] doesn't really agree with dad. Dad says,
[37:31] "No, I don't want the kids going over to
[37:32] that neighbor's house, or I don't want
[37:34] the kids playing in that park. I I think
[37:36] it's dangerous. I don't want them over
[37:37] there." And mom doesn't see any danger
[37:39] in it. And the and dad's gone. And the
[37:41] kids come, "Mom, can we go this, this,
[37:43] this?" And they know what dad says.
[37:46] And she says, "Yes, honey. You go on.
[37:47] It's okay. Mommy don't care if you do
[37:50] that."
[37:52] See, what she's doing is she's vying for
[37:55] the affection of her children over her
[37:57] husband. She's competing with the light.
[37:59] Yeah, that's right. She's competing with
[38:02] the lie. She's in competition with her
[38:04] husband for the love of her children.
[38:06] Yeah,
[38:10] and and she is in some sort of
[38:12] disagreement with that or doesn't see
[38:14] eye to eye. Listen, I would say it this
[38:16] way. Even if dad is wrong,
[38:20] don't do that to your children. Yeah. If
[38:23] you think dad is wrong, then mom, you
[38:24] wait till you guys are alone in your
[38:26] room in the privacy and say, "Listen, I
[38:27] don't understand your rule. Will you
[38:28] explain it again? I think it's hurting
[38:30] the kids this way. I feel this way.
[38:32] Would you please go through it again
[38:33] with me? But don't ever do that in front
[38:35] of the kids. And don't ever contradict
[38:37] that in front of the kids because you're
[38:39] setting them up for the wrong
[38:40] understanding in life. Amen. That's
[38:42] right. Amen. Amen. These things are the
[38:46] truth, friends. It's counter to culture,
[38:48] but it's absolutely right with the
[38:50] nature of God. Amen. And it doesn't mean
[38:53] dad always knows best because dad gets
[38:55] it wrong a lot of the time.
[38:57] And any good dad will admit that I get
[38:59] it wrong. Sometimes my wife will
[39:00] question me, why did you do this and why
[39:02] did you do that? And as she questions
[39:03] me, I begin to realize I'm wrong.
[39:07] But if she does it in the privacy of a
[39:10] conversation between her and I, she
[39:12] hasn't damaged the influence of me with
[39:15] the kids and she hasn't competed for
[39:17] life and she hasn't changed the dynamics
[39:19] in the home at all. All she's done is
[39:21] expressed her right. Amen. As my wife to
[39:24] come and say, "I don't understand.
[39:26] Listen, we've got a right to come to
[39:28] Christ and say, "I, Lord, I don't
[39:29] understand." We have a right any time to
[39:32] come to him and approach him and say,
[39:33] "Your word says this, but I don't
[39:34] understand. Would you please reveal it
[39:36] to me? Will you please give me a fresh
[39:38] vision of it? I don't quite understand
[39:40] it yet." There's nothing wrong with
[39:42] that. Amen. But we've got to set our
[39:44] homes up according to the Bible.
[39:48] These kids, I mean, before they memorize
[39:51] a Bible verse, they're going to start to
[39:54] see God reflected in mom and dad.
[39:58] They're going to start to come to
[39:59] understandings
[40:01] before they even begin to speak.
[40:05] They're going to start to see God
[40:07] reflected in mom and God reflected in
[40:09] dad and the way mom and dad interact
[40:12] with each other.
[40:13] And so it becomes really important that
[40:17] that mom becomes a reflector of the
[40:20] light, that the woman is a reflector of
[40:21] the light, and the dad takes the time to
[40:23] give instruction to his family. It's
[40:26] important that dad's not checked out and
[40:28] turns the keys over to mom and lets mom
[40:30] run the show. Amen. Because it's not
[40:31] fair to her. Amen. If if dad's going to
[40:34] play this role, then dad's got to step
[40:35] up and dad's got to give instruction.
[40:37] He's got to give answers. He's got to
[40:39] give clear objectives. He's got to set a
[40:41] vision for the family. and he's got to
[40:43] give instruction to his home. And if dad
[40:46] will do that, it makes it so much easier
[40:48] for mom. But you know how what a
[40:50] blessing it is when when when a child
[40:53] will come up to mom and say, "Mom, can
[40:55] we do this?"
[40:57] And mom doesn't know. She doesn't know
[41:00] how dad feels about that. We've never
[41:03] talked about it. This is a new we've
[41:04] never crossed this bridge before. And
[41:06] the child comes up, "Mom, can I?" And
[41:08] she says, "You know what? Let's wait
[41:10] till dad gets home and let's talk to dad
[41:12] about and let's ask dad.
[41:16] Why is that so important?
[41:18] Because there's many things that we
[41:20] don't know how to handle.
[41:22] We don't know how to handle the bride of
[41:24] Jesus Christ. But you know where we have
[41:26] to go for all of it? We have to go back
[41:28] to God. We have to go back to the word
[41:29] and say, "Lord, please show me in your
[41:31] word what to do." The word has to be the
[41:33] ultimate authority. The male has to be
[41:35] the ultimate authority over everything.
[41:37] And this is the light. This is the sun.
[41:39] This is what illuminates our lives. And
[41:41] we're here just to reflect this. We're
[41:43] not here to make up our own light. We're
[41:45] not here to make up our own things.
[41:47] We're here just to reflect his light.
[41:50] And so it all becomes so important this
[41:53] this picture of parenthood and the role
[41:56] that we play. And if we play the role
[41:57] that God gives us to play, then there's
[41:59] a real power and demonstration in that
[42:02] role. And so too many times because of
[42:04] the American culture, because of the
[42:06] feminist movement, Amen. They've put
[42:08] they've given so much empowerment to
[42:10] women that women feel somehow belittled
[42:13] or undervalued. Amen. By by giving Amen.
[42:16] by giving authority over to the man and
[42:18] by consenting. But but they don't
[42:20] realize it takes more power to control
[42:22] yourself. It takes more power. Amen. It
[42:25] it takes more character and it takes
[42:27] more power to say no. We're going to ask
[42:29] dad
[42:31] not to give in to weaknesses and not
[42:34] give in to whims. It takes a real power.
[42:36] Amen. to subject ourselves to the word
[42:38] and say, "Listen, I want to demonstrate
[42:40] to you
[42:42] the right way for life because God is
[42:46] the one who runs our life."
[42:50] Amen. So, we see this relationship
[42:52] between the moon and the sun, between
[42:54] mom and dad.
[42:56] Amen. Let's keep going.
[42:59] In leadership again, he said, "First is
[43:01] the mother's kindness, then the father's
[43:04] word. after mother gives you your first
[43:06] step when you look to your daddy all of
[43:09] us for wisdom because he is the head of
[43:10] the house and usually not that he's any
[43:13] smarter but he's just made a leader of
[43:15] his family so we follow what our daddy
[43:17] says do when he says now son I would
[43:20] like for you to do a certain thing then
[43:21] we listen to him because it's wisdom but
[43:24] listen see he has learned a whole lot
[43:25] and we've got to ask him to see what he
[43:28] learned and then we can profit by his
[43:30] what he has learned he tells us now
[43:31] don't go and do this and because I did
[43:34] that so he says He's showing dad's
[43:35] sharing by experience and dad's giving
[43:37] leadership. Hey, hey, you know what?
[43:40] Dads don't always give perfect advice.
[43:44] We'll admit that, too. But still, the
[43:47] respect that we show to dad, Amen, is is
[43:49] is actually a picture of the respect
[43:52] that we're showing to God because of the
[43:54] role that dad plays. And and everybody
[43:56] in the family has to show this respect
[43:59] for the office. And there's sometimes
[44:01] there's people that wind up in a home,
[44:03] amen, where dad is not a spiritual
[44:05] leader in the home. Maybe dad is is not
[44:07] a believer, he's not a Christian, he
[44:09] doesn't come to church and mom does and
[44:10] she wants to raise her children, right?
[44:12] But even the even in that, she's got to
[44:14] be careful the right picture she paints
[44:16] for her children. Just because you don't
[44:18] have a believing husband doesn't mean
[44:20] you can train your children to
[44:22] disrespect their father.
[44:24] That's still their father. And the best
[44:26] thing you can do for those children is
[44:27] teach them to respect their father. even
[44:29] though he gets it wrong and even though
[44:31] he's not the most spiritual one. Amen.
[44:33] If they if you can teach your children
[44:35] to respect their father, they're going
[44:36] to translate to respecting God. Yeah.
[44:40] Amen. Amen.
[44:43] But when dad's gone and we whisper
[44:45] behind his back and dad doesn't
[44:47] understand, he doesn't know, so we're
[44:48] going to do this and this. Don't tell
[44:49] dad. That becomes detrimental. It
[44:52] becomes deadly. It's the it's the wrong
[44:55] picture alto together.
[44:57] In fact, if you if you tear down these
[45:00] institutes of mother and father, we we
[45:02] destroy our own lives. Brother Rem said
[45:05] motherhood is the backbone of the
[45:06] country, the backbone of the nation. You
[45:08] destroy motherhood, you've lost the
[45:10] nation. Because motherhood is the the
[45:12] very beginning phase, the very early
[45:14] onset of everything that's right and
[45:16] good.
[45:18] And you destroy that, you destroy the
[45:19] nation. But I say you destroy
[45:21] fatherhood, you destroy the nation, too.
[45:26] So,
[45:29] uh, Ephesians 6 tells us, "And you
[45:31] fathers, provoke not your children to
[45:32] wrath, but bring them up in the nurture
[45:35] and admonition of the Lord." The father
[45:38] is responsible for how his children turn
[45:40] out. Mother's responsible, too. But
[45:44] mother, mother, mother is so
[45:46] instrumental at the beginning
[45:49] and dad is so instrumental at the end.
[45:52] And it doesn't mean mom's not involved
[45:54] in the end. It doesn't mean dad's not
[45:55] involved in the beginning. So I hope you
[45:57] understand what I'm saying. Mom is so
[45:59] instrumental at the beginning phase.
[46:01] Amen. Those first days, those first
[46:03] months, those first years, that child
[46:05] would not live without mom. It would not
[46:08] survive without mom. It wouldn't learn
[46:10] anything without mom. It wouldn't have
[46:12] it wouldn't have a quality of life
[46:14] without mom. And dad's there, too. Dad's
[46:16] involved, too. Amen. But but in the end,
[46:18] as it grows, it begins to transition.
[46:20] and it begins to move over to dad's
[46:22] leadership. And dad is instrumental in
[46:24] adoption or placing or maturing of that
[46:27] son or daughter. And that's the way God
[46:30] designed it and that's the way it works.
[46:31] Even in the Bible, adoption is the is
[46:34] the job of the father, not the mother.
[46:35] The mother doesn't call the son to
[46:37] adoption. The mother doesn't call the
[46:39] tutor. The mother doesn't set the
[46:40] trials. The mother doesn't set the
[46:42] testings. father does because he's he's
[46:45] determined to have this son or daughter
[46:48] turn out right and to come to full
[46:49] maturity. And what is a mother and
[46:51] father trying to do? They're working
[46:53] together to try to replace themselves.
[46:56] What do you mean, brother Chad? I just
[46:59] remember you're not always going to be
[47:00] like you are right now. You're going to
[47:02] grow old. And if time continues, you're
[47:03] going to fade away. And who is it that's
[47:05] going to stand in your place? Who is it
[47:07] that's going to declare the gospel and
[47:08] shine the light of? It's going to be
[47:10] those children that you raise up. you're
[47:12] actually working to replace yourself.
[47:14] And that's one of the detrimental things
[47:15] in parents. If they're not working to
[47:17] bring a child to full maturity and
[47:19] independence that can stand on their own
[47:21] feet with a balanced view of the word
[47:23] and and an understanding of the life of
[47:25] God, they're doing a disservice. Amen.
[47:28] Not to just themselves or that child to
[47:30] the world. Yeah.
[47:32] Because sometimes you have mothers,
[47:34] mothers who don't want their children to
[47:36] grow up, right? Yeah. You ever seen a
[47:39] mother who doesn't want her child?
[47:40] Because mother is feeding off the
[47:42] affection of that child and that child's
[47:44] need for her and she's feeding she's
[47:46] feeding an insecurity or a lack in
[47:49] herself and she never wants that child
[47:50] to grow up. She wants to mother it all
[47:52] the time and won't let it grow up
[47:54] because mom's getting something out of
[47:55] that. And she would rather stunt the
[47:58] maturity of that child and it never
[48:00] fully developed than to have to part
[48:02] with the affection of the child and deal
[48:03] with it herself. Right.
[48:06] But a real mother will look at this this
[48:08] young girl, young boy growing up and
[48:10] saying, you know, they they need to go
[48:12] on their own. They need to find their
[48:14] own way. They're eventually going to
[48:15] move out. This girl's going to run her
[48:17] own home. This boy's going to have his
[48:18] own house, and I want them to. That's
[48:21] the sacrificial love of a parent. Amen.
[48:24] But the selfish love of a parent is I'm
[48:26] feeding some insecurity in me by their
[48:28] affection, and I'm going to keep them
[48:29] attached to me. So, I'll make all
[48:31] decisions for them. I'll tell them where
[48:33] to go, when to go, what to do. I'll call
[48:35] the doctor. I'll get
[48:38] I'll make every different phone call for
[48:40] them. I'll never teach them how to do
[48:41] anything themselves. They don't know how
[48:43] to renew their license. They don't know
[48:44] how to balance a checkbook. They don't
[48:45] know how to open a bank account. They
[48:47] don't know how to do anything. Yeah. I
[48:50] want them to come to me for all that. I
[48:51] want to be the source for everything.
[48:53] And listen, friends, there's churches
[48:55] that want to be that way.
[48:58] There's churches that want you to come
[48:59] to them for every decision you have to
[49:02] make. You've got to clear it with
[49:03] somebody in the church. You got to get
[49:05] everything from the church and all
[49:06] instruction from the church. Amen.
[49:07] Because the church is feeding off of the
[49:09] need.
[49:11] But oh, if we could be the right kind of
[49:13] church and say, "We're just here to get
[49:14] you started. We're here in those early
[49:16] developmental years when you first give
[49:18] your heart to the Lord and you don't
[49:19] know how to walk and you don't know how
[49:21] to feed yourself. You don't know how to
[49:22] get nourishment out of the word. We're
[49:23] here to encourage you to do Bible
[49:25] studies and stand alongside you, but we
[49:27] want to see you walk on your own. And we
[49:29] want to see you be able to take this
[49:30] word on your own and have your own
[49:32] family, your own home, and do your own
[49:34] thing.
[49:35] That's right. You see how it works from
[49:38] the beginning to the end. Amen.
[49:41] Spiritually and naturally.
[49:45] Amen.
[49:46] There's some fathers who are jealous of
[49:49] the success of their boys. Yes, sir. So
[49:53] they'll never let their boys come into
[49:56] manhood.
[49:57] And dad's always got to put them under
[49:59] thumb.
[50:00] So that my boy can never know more than
[50:02] me. He can never do better than me. He
[50:04] can never have a better idea than me. So
[50:07] there's dads who will shut down every
[50:09] idea their son has and always have a
[50:11] better way. That's that father's own
[50:13] pride coming from some insecurity. He
[50:17] wants to have the answer for all. He
[50:19] wants to be the one who knows the most.
[50:21] And he wants the boys to have to need
[50:22] his wisdom for everything. Oh, but a
[50:25] godly father, a godly father will want
[50:27] his son to pass him up. Amen. Want him
[50:30] to pass him right up. Amen. Want want
[50:32] him to look at the day and say, "Son,
[50:33] you know more about this than I do."
[50:37] Amen. Because that's what we should be
[50:39] working for as parents. Amen. To raise
[50:41] these children this way. And that's what
[50:43] we should be doing as a church. And
[50:45] guess what? That's exactly what God's
[50:46] wanting to do. We'll look at it here in
[50:48] the word. God is looking for somebody to
[50:50] be his replacement on the earth.
[50:54] So he can say like he did with Jesus,
[50:57] "Hear ye him.
[50:59] Hear ye him. I've trained him. I've
[51:01] brought him up. I've brought him to
[51:02] Mount Transfiguration to adoption. This
[51:04] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[51:06] pleased. Hear ye him." And brother
[51:07] Benham said he moved to the background.
[51:11] He said, "Listen, you can get everything
[51:13] you need from him. He's my adopted son.
[51:16] He's got the answers. He's got the life.
[51:18] He's got it all.
[51:20] Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:22] That's the way we should be raising our
[51:24] sons. That's the way we should be
[51:25] raised. Hey, hey, hey, listen. I told
[51:27] the youth, we were we had a youth
[51:29] meeting and I told some of these the the
[51:30] youth, you if God continues on and
[51:34] allows time to continue and we have a
[51:36] couple more decades on this earth,
[51:37] there's going to be most all of this
[51:39] youth, I bet all of this youth will pass
[51:41] us up in revelation. Amen. There'll be
[51:44] young men that come up that can out
[51:46] preach me or any preacher that's ever
[51:47] preached in this pullpit with greater
[51:49] revelation, greater clarity, greater
[51:51] ability. And I want to be the place to
[51:53] fan them on and say, "Go, boy. Go. I
[51:55] love it. It's great. I never saw that
[51:57] before, but thank God he brought it
[51:58] through you." Not to put them under
[52:01] thumb and say, "Well, you didn't get
[52:02] that from me and you didn't get learn it
[52:04] from me and I'm the master of every
[52:07] Come on. That's horrible." Amen. We want
[52:10] everybody to grow and reach their full
[52:12] potential. Amen. We want every life to
[52:15] reach its full potential. And the
[52:16] church, yes, we're supposed to be
[52:18] nurturing and loving and caregiving and
[52:20] create an environment. That's what mom
[52:22] does. She she creates an environment at
[52:24] home. Everybody wants to come home to
[52:26] mom's house.
[52:28] At least if you have a healthy
[52:29] relationship with mom and a good mom,
[52:31] everybody wants to come home to mom's
[52:33] house because mom creates that
[52:36] environment. Grand's connected. Mom's
[52:38] loving. But mom also won't let you
[52:41] suffer.
[52:46] It's dad who will say, "Son, I think you
[52:49] could jump that creek."
[52:51] And mom's like, "No, they can't.
[52:54] Son, let me help you build the ramp for
[52:56] your bike. I think you can go a little
[52:57] higher."
[53:00] And mom's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[53:02] What are you doing?" And say, "Shh, it's
[53:04] going to be okay." Cuz dad knows that
[53:06] boy's got to overcome. He's got to meet
[53:08] challenges. He's got to be willing to
[53:10] take a risk. But what if he falls down
[53:13] and hurts himself? What if he falls down
[53:15] and hurts himself? You know, God will
[53:16] stand and watch you fall down and hurt
[53:18] yourself. That's right. Yes, sir. But
[53:20] the church never will.
[53:23] The church never will. Amen. If you fall
[53:26] down and hurt yourself, guess what?
[53:28] You're going to have five or six people
[53:29] show up at the hospital and say, "Oh,
[53:31] brother, I'm so sorry. What happened to
[53:32] you? Let's pray together. Here's a
[53:34] basket of flowers. Here's a bunch of
[53:36] candy and chocolates.
[53:38] Cuz the church is a mother role and we
[53:40] should do that. We shouldn't ever be any
[53:41] different than that. Amen. But God's the
[53:44] one who says, "Hey, stand back for a
[53:45] minute. This is my boy. I want to see if
[53:47] you can make the jump." That's right.
[53:54] That's why healthy, well-balanced
[53:56] children come out of a home with a
[53:57] mother and a father.
[53:59] And I believe healthy, well-balanced
[54:01] Christians come from a place where
[54:02] they've got the love and nurture and and
[54:04] affection of a of a church, a stable
[54:06] church that gather around them and love
[54:07] them and care for them. But they also
[54:09] are constantly pointed to the son, to
[54:11] the father. But father says, but father
[54:13] says, but father says, but father says.
[54:15] And if we don't know, let's ask father.
[54:17] Yeah. Amen. And if I don't know, let's
[54:19] wait till father tells us what to do.
[54:21] and and and and hey,
[54:25] we don't want to be the kind of church
[54:26] that tries to tries
[54:29] to overcompensate
[54:31] for our lack of dad
[54:37] because sometimes
[54:39] in our development, in our spiritual
[54:41] development, God will let us struggle
[54:44] through.
[54:47] God will let us do hard things.
[54:52] God will let us face issues, face our
[54:55] mistakes, face challenges
[54:58] and and he and he and he wants us to
[55:05] and but but not so with mom, not so with
[55:08] the church.
[55:10] And when the word lays an issue out and
[55:12] the word says this is the way to do it,
[55:15] we can't as a church say but that's too
[55:17] hard.
[55:20] But they have a special circumstance.
[55:24] But I feel so sorry for them.
[55:27] The minute we do that, we're trying to
[55:28] overcompensate.
[55:30] And it appears to be that the church
[55:33] loves me more than God loves me. Or the
[55:36] church loves me more than the word loves
[55:38] me. The word is hard, but the church is
[55:41] loving. When the church does that, what
[55:44] is the church doing? The church is
[55:46] fighting for affection.
[55:48] Right. Fighting the word for the
[55:50] affection of the people. Yeah. Yeah.
[55:53] Yeah. The best thing we can do is have
[55:56] people fall in love with the word and
[55:57] point to the word and point to the word
[55:58] and point to the But what if we're
[56:00] diminished? And so be it. Let's be
[56:01] diminished. Point to the word. Point to
[56:03] the word for the father says.
[56:06] And even in hard situations, there's
[56:08] time that there's time for church
[56:09] discipline. You know that. But we only
[56:11] do so because the word said, not because
[56:13] we like it.
[56:15] There's sometimes you have to say no to
[56:17] something. Sometimes you can you say yes
[56:18] to something or there's times you say no
[56:20] and we don't say no because we like
[56:22] saying no. We say no because father said
[56:24] no.
[56:27] Amen. Amen. But we can't start making
[56:30] excuses and making this motherly love
[56:32] begin to compensate and compete with the
[56:35] affections of the people.
[56:38] I say, Lord, let us stay in our place
[56:41] and reflect that right light and set up
[56:44] a place that's spiritually healthy,
[56:47] that's balanced, where people can mature
[56:49] to the full potential.
[56:52] Amen.
[56:54] I look forward to the day one of these
[56:56] young boys that grow up or even from
[56:58] somewhere else comes through the church
[57:00] 30 years younger than me and starts
[57:02] preaching the word. I'm like, I'm blown
[57:04] away. I've never heard this before.
[57:05] Where did you get that's the I know
[57:06] that's the message. heard those quotes,
[57:07] but I never caught that before. God
[57:09] bless you, boy. Amen.
[57:13] Amen. Where we see where we see growth
[57:15] in our young people, we see growth in
[57:17] our families, we see people growing in a
[57:19] healthy way, and they got their own
[57:21] relationship with the father.
[57:25] Amen. See, mother can never become
[57:28] jealous of father.
[57:30] You know, there's a time in life when
[57:33] things begin to turn. When a when a when
[57:36] a toddler's tiny and everything's about
[57:39] mom, mom, mom, mom, mom's everything.
[57:41] But as they start to grow up, then dad
[57:43] becomes every dad becomes the hero. Dad
[57:46] is great. Dad's a superhero. Dad wears a
[57:48] cape. Dad can do anything.
[57:52] And mom can't get jealous of that
[57:55] because that's the healthiest thing for
[57:57] that child to start to turn towards dad
[58:00] because dad's got to guide them through
[58:02] the rest of their adoption phase, the
[58:04] rest of the maturing phase. And that's
[58:06] what we need to do as a a group of
[58:09] believers. We need to say, "Hey, you
[58:11] need you need to get connected with your
[58:14] father.
[58:16] You need to know him."
[58:20] Look at what God says about Abraham in
[58:22] Genesis 18. Says, "And the Lord said, '
[58:26] Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[58:27] which I do, seeing that Abraham shall
[58:29] surely become a great and mighty nation,
[58:32] and all the nations of the earth shall
[58:33] be blessed in him, for I know him that
[58:35] he will command his children and his
[58:37] household after him, and they shall keep
[58:39] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[58:41] judgment, that the Lord may bring upon
[58:43] Abraham that which he has spoken of
[58:45] him."
[58:46] God chose Abraham. But what did he say
[58:47] he knew about Abraham? I I know Abraham.
[58:52] I know him that he will command his
[58:54] children in his household after him.
[58:56] They shall keep the way of the Lord.
[58:58] What was it that God knew about Abraham?
[59:00] He chose Abraham. But what was it he
[59:01] loved about Abraham? That Abraham was
[59:04] going to teach his household to follow
[59:06] after the Lord.
[59:10] Amen. I want God to say that of me.
[59:18] In Exodus
[59:20] chapter 3, God's speaking to Moses. He
[59:22] says, "Moreover," he said, "I am the God
[59:24] of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
[59:27] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And
[59:29] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[59:32] look upon God.
[59:34] He went when he when when he when he
[59:36] talked to Moses and he began to uh
[59:39] identify himself said, "I'm the God of
[59:41] your father,
[59:43] the God of Abraham." He goes right down
[59:45] through his spiritual lineage.
[59:48] But praise God. Do you know that you're
[59:50] a child of Abraham
[59:53] by faith spiritually? You're a child of
[59:56] Abraham. You're a descendant of Abraham.
[59:57] You're part of the seed of Abraham, part
[59:59] of Christ. Amen. And so now he's the God
[1:00:04] of our father Abraham and now he's our
[1:00:07] God. Amen.
[1:00:09] Moses here at the burning bush,
[1:00:13] he comes in contact with his father.
[1:00:17] Moses was born a proper child. We we
[1:00:19] know the story uh uh back in Egypt. He
[1:00:22] was born under a sign. He was born a
[1:00:23] proper child and his parents hid him for
[1:00:26] three months. And then they then they
[1:00:28] because of the decree to go out to kill
[1:00:30] all the male Jewish boys, they had to
[1:00:33] hide him away. And then to save his
[1:00:35] life, they had to put him in an ark and
[1:00:36] float him down the Nile. And he was
[1:00:38] found by Pharaoh's daughter. But his
[1:00:40] sister Miriam went along to watch the
[1:00:42] little ark along the way. And when he
[1:00:44] saw when she saw Pharaoh's uh uh
[1:00:47] daughter pull him out of the of the Nile
[1:00:51] and take him up, she quickly ran to him
[1:00:53] and said, "Shall I fetch a nursemaid
[1:00:55] from the Hebrew women?"
[1:00:58] And so she said, "Yes." So she went and
[1:01:00] got her mother, which was Moses' mom.
[1:01:03] And Moses was nursed by his own mom,
[1:01:06] and she got paid for it, too. That was
[1:01:08] pretty good.
[1:01:12] But she began to teach Moses,
[1:01:16] you're a deliverer.
[1:01:18] From the time he could first begin to to
[1:01:20] to understand what she was saying, she
[1:01:23] would begin to teach him about Abraham.
[1:01:25] We're we're the children of Abraham. And
[1:01:28] God made a promise to our father
[1:01:30] Abraham. And that promise was that we
[1:01:32] should sojourn in a strange land for 400
[1:01:34] years, but he'll bring us out with a
[1:01:36] mighty hand. And son, you were born
[1:01:38] under a sign. when you were born, this
[1:01:40] was the sign that we saw and you're a
[1:01:41] proper child and we hid you away and
[1:01:44] God's preserved you because you're the
[1:01:45] deliverer.
[1:01:47] You know, everything she was telling him
[1:01:49] was the truth. Amen. And there was
[1:01:52] nothing inappropriate in what she was
[1:01:53] telling him because it was all the
[1:01:54] truth. They were children of Abraham. It
[1:01:57] was time for the promise. He was the po
[1:01:59] to be the place of the fulfillment of
[1:02:00] the promise. And she was telling him the
[1:02:02] word. Listen. She was telling him the
[1:02:05] word for his day. Amen. the promise for
[1:02:09] his day. She was telling him his
[1:02:11] position in that promise, his purpose in
[1:02:13] life, who his father was, what his
[1:02:15] lineage was, that he was Abraham's
[1:02:16] lineage, that he's part of the promise,
[1:02:18] and that he's part of he's part of the
[1:02:20] deliverance. She told him the truth. She
[1:02:22] told him the word for his day. She had
[1:02:24] preached it perfectly.
[1:02:26] But although Moses got enthused, and
[1:02:28] although Moses believed it, it didn't
[1:02:30] translate into a life that Moses could
[1:02:33] put into service. Moses had to run away
[1:02:35] after trying on his own effort to
[1:02:37] deliver Israel. Killed one Egyptian, ran
[1:02:39] away scared for his life. Went to the
[1:02:41] backside of the desert for 40 years and
[1:02:43] got beat around and beat out and tossed
[1:02:45] around and had all kinds of experiences.
[1:02:47] But finally, when God was ready, he came
[1:02:49] to him. And now, this wasn't mother
[1:02:52] telling him the story. Now, it was
[1:02:55] father telling him the story. Amen. When
[1:02:58] he met the pillar of fire, which was no
[1:03:00] more than almighty God. when he met the
[1:03:01] pillar of the fire, the pillar of fire
[1:03:03] confirmed the promise. And now
[1:03:05] everything the church has been telling
[1:03:07] you is true. I'm here as your father to
[1:03:09] bring you into adoption.
[1:03:12] Amen.
[1:03:13] Listen, we come to church Sunday and
[1:03:16] Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday, and
[1:03:17] the best thing that we can do is tell
[1:03:19] you what hour it is, what time it is,
[1:03:21] what the promise is for Abraham's seed,
[1:03:23] what's going on, and what your part is
[1:03:25] in it. But you've got to meet the pillar
[1:03:27] of fire. You got to meet dad because dad
[1:03:29] is the only one that can bring you to
[1:03:31] maturity and bring you to your position
[1:03:32] and bring you to adoption. The church
[1:03:35] can't do it. We're doing what we should
[1:03:37] do. As we nurse you along, as we give
[1:03:39] you life, we teach you all the stories.
[1:03:41] We tell you all the things. We tell you
[1:03:43] where we came from and where we're going
[1:03:45] and what the purpose is. That's exactly
[1:03:47] what the church should be doing.
[1:03:48] Jockabed was doing exactly what she
[1:03:50] should have done as she nursed life and
[1:03:52] strength and care into Moses. As a
[1:03:55] church, we do that. We help you take
[1:03:57] your first steps and we help you
[1:03:58] spiritually along. We help teach you
[1:04:00] that the word of the day. Amen.
[1:04:04] But at some point, you've got to meet
[1:04:06] your father. Amen. And he's got to tell
[1:04:09] you who you are. He's got to confirm
[1:04:11] everything you heard. Moses has got to
[1:04:13] the place where he just thought mom was
[1:04:15] wrong.
[1:04:17] Out in the wilderness kicking around,
[1:04:20] following goats, following sheep. Amen.
[1:04:23] He got thinking, "Well, maybe mom was
[1:04:24] wrong." and maybe what I heard, maybe it
[1:04:26] doesn't apply to me. Maybe there's a
[1:04:27] mistake somewhere. Yeah. But when he met
[1:04:30] his father,
[1:04:32] and his father told him, I'm confirming
[1:04:35] to you everything you heard in church is
[1:04:37] right, and you're the one. Amen. Oh,
[1:04:40] God, help us meet the burning bush.
[1:04:41] Every one of you young people,
[1:04:43] everybody. Amen. May God help you come
[1:04:45] in contact with the burning bush where
[1:04:47] everything you've heard in church and
[1:04:48] you're not sure. Is it me? Is it not me?
[1:04:50] Is it right? Is it not right? May your
[1:04:51] father come to you and say, "Son, it's
[1:04:53] you and it's time for you to start
[1:04:55] growing up now. This is the purpose I
[1:04:58] have for you. You're my bride. You're
[1:04:59] going to manifest my word in this end
[1:05:01] time." Amen. Amen. It takes the father
[1:05:05] to bring us into position.
[1:05:08] Mother can nurture, mother can teach,
[1:05:10] mother can give life, and she can
[1:05:12] sustain life, but it takes God to bring
[1:05:15] us into position.
[1:05:17] Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:05:20] Amen.
[1:05:23] Excuse me while I try to find out where
[1:05:26] I am.
[1:05:29] Praise be to God.
[1:05:32] I want to jump down a little bit.
[1:05:41] Reb says in the God who is rich in mercy
[1:05:44] says I'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:05:46] doctrine but to straighten it out that
[1:05:48] we might get away from this fear and
[1:05:50] scare you don't know who you are you're
[1:05:52] not going to be but now are you the sons
[1:05:54] of God see you always were sons of God
[1:05:56] for when God had you in his thinking at
[1:05:58] the beginning you have to be some part
[1:06:00] of you your life that's in you now had
[1:06:02] to be with God before well when he was
[1:06:05] before he was even become material on
[1:06:07] the earth before there was anything but
[1:06:09] God you were one of his attributes
[1:06:11] He knowed what your name would be. He
[1:06:14] knowed the color of hair you would have.
[1:06:16] He knowed all about you.
[1:06:19] John in 1 John 3, John says this,
[1:06:22] "Behold, what manner of love the Father
[1:06:26] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:06:28] called the sons of God." Just think of
[1:06:31] that sentence just for a minute. Yeah.
[1:06:34] What manner of love the father has
[1:06:36] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:06:39] called the sons of God. Can you think of
[1:06:42] anything greater in your life than to be
[1:06:44] called a son of God?
[1:06:47] Therefore, the world knoweth us not
[1:06:49] because it knew him not. Beloved, now
[1:06:52] are we the sons of God, and it does not
[1:06:54] yet appear what we shall be, but we know
[1:06:56] we know that when he shall appear, we
[1:06:58] shall be like him, for we shall see him
[1:07:00] as he is. What manner of love the
[1:07:04] father's bestowed upon us that we should
[1:07:06] be called the sons of God
[1:07:14] in the message the comforter he says oh
[1:07:17] he's a good father he's the fountain of
[1:07:20] goodness the great resource of all
[1:07:23] goodness and fatherhood belongs to our
[1:07:25] God he's so good to his believing
[1:07:27] children is he so good to you he's so
[1:07:31] good to me. Amen. You know, and in a
[1:07:35] healthy home, there's no competition
[1:07:38] between mom and dad. Mom's happy to be
[1:07:39] mom and dad's happy to be dad.
[1:07:43] Spiritually, there should be no
[1:07:44] competition between the word and the
[1:07:45] church.
[1:07:48] Man, we want the word to be preeminent.
[1:07:51] We want the word to be dominant. We want
[1:07:52] the word to be the light. And we just
[1:07:54] want to reflect that light.
[1:07:57] We We're not here to bring forth our own
[1:07:59] life. We're bring here to bring forth
[1:08:00] his life.
[1:08:02] We're not here to reproduce ourselves on
[1:08:04] the earth. We're here to reproduce him
[1:08:05] on the earth. Where it's all about him.
[1:08:08] It's all about the father. It's all
[1:08:09] about the male. And we're just here to
[1:08:12] facilitate that and care for it, nurture
[1:08:14] it, and do all that we can to help it
[1:08:16] along. But we can never replace the
[1:08:18] father. We can never be the father. We
[1:08:21] can only play the role that God's called
[1:08:23] us to play. And you know what's
[1:08:25] beautiful is the word the word of God
[1:08:29] never teaches us to disrespect the
[1:08:32] church.
[1:08:34] Forsake not the assembling togethers of
[1:08:36] yourself. I mean all these scriptures
[1:08:37] that tell us to come to church. The word
[1:08:40] never tells us to disrespect the church.
[1:08:44] And the church should never teach us to
[1:08:45] disrespect the word. Amen.
[1:08:50] Dad should never let his children
[1:08:51] disrespect mom. That's right. And mom
[1:08:55] should never let the children disrespect
[1:08:57] dad.
[1:08:58] Do you get it? Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[1:09:02] never taught us to do away with church.
[1:09:07] The Bible never taught us to do away
[1:09:08] with church. To forsake the assembling
[1:09:11] together. No. Never did. And neither did
[1:09:13] the prophet. Never disrespected
[1:09:16] the church.
[1:09:18] But may the church never disrespect God.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:22] So that there's a mutual respect. Amen.
[1:09:25] That that the the the to tell my
[1:09:27] children as they get older and they
[1:09:28] start moving into independence. Amen.
[1:09:30] Always always when they move into
[1:09:32] independence, they want to shake loose a
[1:09:34] little bit of of mother's overreaching
[1:09:36] care and mother's security and mother's
[1:09:38] safety. They want to they want to
[1:09:39] stretch, especially boys. And there's
[1:09:41] nothing wrong with that. They've got to
[1:09:42] move into manhood. They've got to be
[1:09:43] able to make their own decisions and
[1:09:45] move out. But they can never do it in a
[1:09:47] way that disrespects their mom. There's
[1:09:49] a father here who's here to make sure
[1:09:51] that hap that doesn't happen. And
[1:09:53] although we want people to grow
[1:09:55] spiritually, to be spiritually
[1:09:56] independent, to be have their own
[1:09:58] relationship with God, and to be able to
[1:10:00] come into adoption with God and God work
[1:10:02] through them as an individual, they can
[1:10:04] never disrespect the church. Amen. Or
[1:10:07] the role that the church plays. Yeah.
[1:10:09] Because the Bible doesn't. Amen.
[1:10:11] Everybody's got to play their part.
[1:10:13] Amen. But we want God the Father to be
[1:10:15] supreme. And he's the great resource of
[1:10:18] all goodness. And fatherhood belongs to
[1:10:21] our God.
[1:10:24] In Romans 8:14, it says, "For as many as
[1:10:26] are led by the spirit of God, they are
[1:10:27] the sons of God. For you have not
[1:10:29] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:10:31] fear, but you have received the spirit
[1:10:32] of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
[1:10:35] Father." The spirit self bearing witness
[1:10:38] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:10:39] of God. Oh, I'm so glad that he's given
[1:10:42] us the spirit of adoption that cries,
[1:10:44] "Aba, Father."
[1:10:45] There's something in us that loves our
[1:10:47] father, that loves that loves his love
[1:10:50] for us. That's crying out to him.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:57] In this message, there's a I want to
[1:10:59] read this quote and then I want to go to
[1:11:00] one more scripture as we close. Says,
[1:11:03] could you imagine a little mouse about
[1:11:05] that long under the great garners of
[1:11:06] Egypt saying, "I just better eat two
[1:11:08] grains a day. It may not last through
[1:11:10] the winter. Oh my, he wants you to ask
[1:11:13] abundantly so that your joy could be
[1:11:15] full. Don't be afraid to ask God for
[1:11:17] anything, for he's willing, more willing
[1:11:19] to give it than you are to receive it.
[1:11:22] If we just get that little shadow wiped
[1:11:24] away to know that he's willing to do it,
[1:11:26] you're his children. He loves you. You
[1:11:30] know how you like to minister and do
[1:11:32] good things to your children? The very
[1:11:34] strain of fatherhood of parent to your
[1:11:36] children comes from God. That's right.
[1:11:38] because he's the father of us all and he
[1:11:40] loves us and he wants to do for us. If
[1:11:43] he can just get us lined up with the
[1:11:45] blessing and so forth, he can trust us.
[1:11:47] Then there's just the heavens is open to
[1:11:49] all of us.
[1:11:52] God, brother said God loves to bless his
[1:11:54] children. And every true father loves to
[1:11:57] bless his children. But he said if he
[1:11:58] could get us lined up to his word, to
[1:12:00] his program, he loves to bless us. God's
[1:12:03] blessing will never equal spoiling.
[1:12:07] Right. Amen. God loves to bless us. And
[1:12:10] and it's so important for us to realize
[1:12:12] that that God's desire is to bless us.
[1:12:15] He's the fountain of all good things and
[1:12:17] fatherhood's in him. And what he wants
[1:12:18] to do is show our blessings. And he
[1:12:20] wants to bless us more than we even want
[1:12:22] we even realize how much he wants to
[1:12:23] bless us. But he can never bless us in a
[1:12:26] way that stunts our spiritual maturity.
[1:12:30] He can never bless us in a way that
[1:12:32] inhibits our growth. Right? So sometimes
[1:12:35] he's got to let us make our choice and
[1:12:38] make our mistake and move outside of his
[1:12:41] blessing so we can learn a lesson so
[1:12:43] that he can we can get lined up with his
[1:12:44] program so he can pour the blessings.
[1:12:46] It's never that he doesn't want to bless
[1:12:47] us. He always wants to bless us. But
[1:12:49] sometimes the greatest blessing is not
[1:12:51] in showering out blessings but letting
[1:12:52] us go our own way for a little bit
[1:12:55] because he's a good father.
[1:12:58] Man, that's the role of a father. A
[1:12:59] father's going to make sure that his
[1:13:01] children aren't spoiled.
[1:13:03] are spoiled. If you can turn with me to
[1:13:06] Luke chapter 15.
[1:13:13] Luke chapter 15
[1:13:17] and let's go to verse 11.
[1:13:25] Luke chapter 15 and verse 11.
[1:13:33] says, ' And a certain man had two sons,
[1:13:36] and the younger of them said to his
[1:13:37] father, "Father, give me the portion of
[1:13:39] goods that fallth to me, and he divideth
[1:13:42] unto them his living. And not many days
[1:13:44] after the younger son gathered all
[1:13:46] together, and took his journey into a
[1:13:48] far country, and there wasted his
[1:13:50] substance with righteous living." And
[1:13:52] when he had spent all there, there arose
[1:13:54] a mighty famine in the land. And he
[1:13:56] began to be in want. And he went into
[1:13:58] and joined himself to the citizen of
[1:13:59] that country. And he sent him into the
[1:14:01] fields to feed swine. And he would fain
[1:14:03] have filled his belly with the husk that
[1:14:05] the swine did eat, and no man gave unto
[1:14:07] him. And when he came to himself, he
[1:14:09] said, "How many hired servants of my
[1:14:12] fathers have bread enough and to spare,
[1:14:14] and I perish with hunger? I will arise
[1:14:17] and go to my father and will say unto
[1:14:19] him, Father, I have sinned against
[1:14:21] heaven and before thee. And I am no more
[1:14:23] worthy to be called thy son. Make me as
[1:14:26] one of the hired servants.
[1:14:28] And he arose and he came to his father.
[1:14:30] But when he was yet a great way off, his
[1:14:32] father saw him and had compassion and
[1:14:34] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[1:14:37] And the son saith unto him, Father, I
[1:14:40] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[1:14:42] sight, and am no more worthy to be
[1:14:44] called thy son. But the father said to
[1:14:46] his servants, "Bring forth the best
[1:14:48] robe, and put on him, and put put it on
[1:14:51] him, and put a ring on his hand, and
[1:14:53] shoes on his feet, and bring hither the
[1:14:56] fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat
[1:14:58] and be merry. For this my son was dead
[1:15:00] and is alive again. He was lost and is
[1:15:02] found," and they began to be merry. Here
[1:15:05] you have the story of a son. We know him
[1:15:07] as the prodical son in the Bible.
[1:15:09] He he couldn't live in his father's
[1:15:12] house the way he wanted to live cuz his
[1:15:13] father had a standard
[1:15:17] and his father wasn't going to adjust
[1:15:19] the standard for the son. So when the
[1:15:21] son didn't want to live the father's
[1:15:23] standard, he went away. Yeah. And the
[1:15:26] father didn't change his standard to
[1:15:29] keep the son. Amen.
[1:15:33] Because the son would have lost respect
[1:15:34] for the father if he had. Amen.
[1:15:38] See, the father wanted this son and he
[1:15:42] wanted him to come to adoption.
[1:15:45] Because the father cared about his
[1:15:46] character and cared about his adoption,
[1:15:48] he couldn't change his standard to keep
[1:15:50] the son. He had to keep the standard
[1:15:53] because he wanted the son to come to
[1:15:54] adoption.
[1:15:56] I hope this makes sense because if he
[1:15:59] had given into the the willful fancies
[1:16:01] of the son and changed the standard for
[1:16:03] the son, the son would have never
[1:16:05] learned self-restraint and self-control
[1:16:06] and he could never be a son that he
[1:16:08] could back up and let him take the
[1:16:10] family business. But the father wanted a
[1:16:13] son that he could turn everything over
[1:16:15] to so that he could diminish and so he
[1:16:17] could exalt a son. Yeah. And so in order
[1:16:20] to do that, he's got to remain the
[1:16:22] father. and he can't shower blessings
[1:16:25] and he can't bless what he can't bless.
[1:16:27] So he says, "Father, let me go ahead and
[1:16:28] my inheritance. I'm done. I'm going.
[1:16:30] I've got a different life I want to
[1:16:31] live." And he gives it to him and he
[1:16:33] lets him go. Neither does the father
[1:16:34] chase him down.
[1:16:38] Yeah. This is important, right? Because
[1:16:40] this is how the father deals with you
[1:16:42] and I. Yes.
[1:16:46] when he gets the fill of his life, when
[1:16:50] he goes his own way, not his father's
[1:16:52] way, but his own way, and he goes to the
[1:16:54] end of that way and he finds himself
[1:16:55] with nothing. He didn't lean on his
[1:16:57] father's wisdom, his father's
[1:16:58] experience, his father's leadership. He
[1:17:00] went in his own leadership in his own
[1:17:02] way. And when he comes to the ruination
[1:17:04] and end of everything, Amen. Now he he's
[1:17:06] a servant. He's feeding swine. He wants
[1:17:08] to eat the pig's food. And all of a
[1:17:10] sudden, he remembers the character of
[1:17:12] his father. Amen. because his father
[1:17:15] maintained a godly character and didn't
[1:17:17] give in to the whims of his son. And
[1:17:19] when he realized the character of his
[1:17:21] father, then he says, "How many servants
[1:17:23] in my father's house have plenty of
[1:17:25] bread? How many I'm not worthy to be a
[1:17:27] son, but I will run back to my father
[1:17:29] and ask if I can serve my father." Amen.
[1:17:32] Praise God. Look at the attitude of this
[1:17:34] son. He realizes my father was right. My
[1:17:36] father was my righteous and he's holy
[1:17:38] and he's got everything that I need. I
[1:17:41] can't go back as a son. I'm ashamed. But
[1:17:43] I'll go back just as a servant. My
[1:17:45] father's the kind of man I would love to
[1:17:47] serve.
[1:17:49] Right?
[1:17:51] But when the father sees him a long way
[1:17:53] off, what does he do? He beholds him. He
[1:17:55] has compassion on him. And he runs out
[1:17:57] to meet him and embraces him. And his
[1:17:59] son tells him, "Father, I'm not worthy
[1:18:00] to be called a son." And listen, he
[1:18:02] doesn't answer the son.
[1:18:05] Father, I'm not worthy to be called your
[1:18:07] son. I've done all this bad stuff. I'm
[1:18:08] not worthy at all. I'm not worthy to be
[1:18:11] called your son. He never says a word.
[1:18:13] He never responds to that at all. He
[1:18:15] calls the servant, "Go get the robe. Go
[1:18:17] get the ring. Go kill the fatted cats.
[1:18:19] Put shoes on his feet. This is my son.
[1:18:22] He's always been my son. He will always
[1:18:24] be my son. There's nothing he can do
[1:18:26] that will take him from being my son."
[1:18:29] But the father was waiting for him to
[1:18:31] come to adoption.
[1:18:34] And he had to let him go. And he had to
[1:18:36] let him decide. And he had to keep a
[1:18:38] standard. And he had to do all the
[1:18:40] things that he did. But he never changed
[1:18:42] the way he felt about his son.
[1:18:45] And when he came back learning hard
[1:18:47] lessons,
[1:18:49] he learn I think he learned some hard
[1:18:51] lessons.
[1:18:53] When he came back, he came back
[1:18:55] different.
[1:18:58] But the father's love had never changed.
[1:19:01] And what did the father say? Bring the
[1:19:04] robe.
[1:19:07] Bring the royal garment. Yes.
[1:19:10] put shoes on his feet. He's not a
[1:19:12] servant. He's a son. And put the ring on
[1:19:16] his finger. What's he doing? He's
[1:19:18] bringing him back into adoption. What he
[1:19:20] always wanted for this son was for the
[1:19:22] son to mature into a place that he can
[1:19:24] entrust him with the signate ring.
[1:19:28] Amen.
[1:19:30] Oh, praise God. That's the goal of our
[1:19:33] father to bring us into this place of
[1:19:36] adoption where he can slip the ring on
[1:19:38] our finger. Oh, he won't change the
[1:19:40] standard for us, friends. Because if he
[1:19:43] changes the standard, we'll lose
[1:19:44] respect.
[1:19:46] But when we go our own way and we failed
[1:19:48] again and again and we find ourselves in
[1:19:50] situations we don't like in places that
[1:19:52] are miserable. Amen. We Hey, listen.
[1:19:54] There's many times I've been so willing
[1:19:56] just to be a servant,
[1:19:59] to go back to a righteous God who does
[1:20:01] everything right and his house has
[1:20:03] everything in order.
[1:20:05] But he's never let me come back as a
[1:20:07] servant. No matter how much I messed up,
[1:20:09] he wants me to come back as a son in
[1:20:11] position as an adopted son. Amen. To
[1:20:14] take my place back in the family. Amen.
[1:20:18] Because that's where that son was always
[1:20:20] meant to be with a ring on his finger.
[1:20:23] That's what God's doing with us right
[1:20:25] now. And we have trials. Yes. Does he
[1:20:27] let hard things happen? Yes. Does he let
[1:20:29] us make our own choices? And he doesn't
[1:20:31] stop us. Listen, mom would stop you.
[1:20:37] Mom would stop you. Don't do that, son.
[1:20:40] You can't. No, I won't let you out the
[1:20:42] door. You're going to hurt yourself.
[1:20:46] Stand in front of the door. No, you
[1:20:48] can't go out there. You're going to get
[1:20:49] killed on the motorcycle.
[1:20:55] Dad will say, "Mom, there's nothing else
[1:20:56] we can do. He's of age.
[1:20:59] He's got to learn his lesson." Yeah.
[1:21:02] That's the difference between a mother
[1:21:04] and a father. And that's the difference
[1:21:05] between God and the church.
[1:21:09] We don't want anybody to get hurt. We
[1:21:11] don't want anybody to suffer. Listen, as
[1:21:13] a pastor, sometimes I sit down with
[1:21:15] people and they tell me the struggles
[1:21:16] that they've gone through and I tell
[1:21:18] them, "Listen, I if if it was up to me,
[1:21:22] I wouldn't have any suffering for you
[1:21:25] because the stories are so hard. The
[1:21:27] situations are so difficult. I mean
[1:21:29] there's real pain, there's real
[1:21:30] suffering, there's real hardship, but
[1:21:33] the fact is you can see that God has
[1:21:34] allowed it for a purpose. And although
[1:21:37] as a pastor and all as a brother, I
[1:21:39] would never want you to go through that.
[1:21:41] And I would never if if God asked me,
[1:21:44] okay, this is the decision I want to
[1:21:46] make. I'm going to have him suffer. I'm
[1:21:47] going to make it easy. I'll say easy. If
[1:21:49] you ask me, just I don't want them to
[1:21:51] suffer. I don't want anybody to suffer.
[1:21:52] I don't want anybody to have it hard. I
[1:21:54] don't want them to have a bad day, a
[1:21:55] difficulty, a sickness, a loss of
[1:21:57] anything.
[1:21:58] Yeah. Right. But God doesn't look at it
[1:22:00] that way. That's the way we look at it
[1:22:02] as a church. We would say no suffering,
[1:22:05] no hardship, no sickness, no loneliness.
[1:22:08] Yeah. Right. But that's not how God does
[1:22:11] it. That's not how God sees it. He sees
[1:22:15] character for reigning, maturity, coming
[1:22:18] to adoption. He sees it as necessary
[1:22:21] sometimes.
[1:22:23] And that's why we have to have a mother
[1:22:26] and a father.
[1:22:28] The church has a role to play, but she
[1:22:31] can never take the place of the father.
[1:22:34] And you're never going to come to
[1:22:35] maturity unless you can grow past that
[1:22:38] nurture of the mother and move into a
[1:22:40] relationship with the father where the
[1:22:43] father can deal with you as a son and
[1:22:46] bring you to adoption.
[1:22:48] Where you quit running to mom every time
[1:22:50] you get a boo boo. Yeah.
[1:22:56] You ever seen a a mom and a dad, an
[1:22:59] overprotective mom on the playground?
[1:23:00] Every time the kid falls, first thing he
[1:23:02] does to look up to see if mom looked.
[1:23:04] And if mom looked, he wales.
[1:23:08] But if mom didn't see him, he'll get up
[1:23:09] and play.
[1:23:14] And usually when dad's there and he goes
[1:23:16] on his bike and he falls and and dad
[1:23:19] says, "It's okay. Let him get up.
[1:23:21] He'll be okay. It's all right, Mom. He's
[1:23:23] 15 now. You know,
[1:23:26] you don't have to run over there with a
[1:23:28] Flintstone band-aid
[1:23:30] and Neosporin
[1:23:34] because that's the different view of a
[1:23:36] mother and a father. As a church, we
[1:23:39] want no suffering, no hardship, nothing
[1:23:42] ever hard. I want nothing ever hard to
[1:23:44] happen in your life today because I
[1:23:46] don't like to see you suffer. But God
[1:23:49] when he's your father, he says that's my
[1:23:51] son and he can handle it.
[1:23:54] That's my daughter and she can over she
[1:23:56] needs to overcome that.
[1:23:58] She needs and that's why when we mature
[1:24:00] friends, we need to go past the church
[1:24:02] and quit crying every time we get a boo
[1:24:04] boo and run to the church and ask for a
[1:24:05] bunch of sympathy and help. We need to
[1:24:07] just get up as a son or daughter of God
[1:24:08] and say, "My father knows what I need.
[1:24:12] My father's looking out for me and he's
[1:24:13] training me to be a son." And all these
[1:24:15] things work together for good. Amen.
[1:24:20] Sometimes people use their social media
[1:24:22] post or their WhatsApp statuses just to
[1:24:24] get sympathy from the church. It's a
[1:24:27] hard time. It's so hard for me. Start a
[1:24:29] prayer chain. Sometimes what we need to
[1:24:31] do is grow up and say, "God, you're in
[1:24:33] charge of me and I'm with you and I
[1:24:35] trust in you." I'm not going to use
[1:24:38] every hardship in my life to get
[1:24:39] affection from 50 other people.
[1:24:42] That's immaturity. Amen. I'm going to
[1:24:45] grow up to a place where God, if you
[1:24:47] allowed it, it's for a purpose. And if I
[1:24:49] need comfort, you'll send it to me.
[1:24:52] But I'm trusting in you to lead me
[1:24:53] through. And help me, Lord, to learn
[1:24:55] what I need to learn. And help me to
[1:24:56] grow to be more like you day by day.
[1:25:00] We need a mother, but we we're desperate
[1:25:02] for a father. We're never going to make
[1:25:05] it to maturity unless we come into an
[1:25:07] individual relationship with God
[1:25:09] Almighty, our father. Yes. And that's
[1:25:12] what we need more than anything. And the
[1:25:14] care of a mother, the care of the
[1:25:15] church, the love of the church will
[1:25:16] never go away, will never diminish it.
[1:25:19] It'll never never disrespect it, never
[1:25:22] go away. But to come to maturity, we
[1:25:24] need our father.
[1:25:26] May God bless you. Let's all stand
[1:25:28] together. I'm going to I'm going to read
[1:25:31] these two scripture in this quote while
[1:25:33] we're standing and the musicians come. I
[1:25:35] quoted it earlier, but I just want to
[1:25:36] read it together. Matthew 17:5. This is
[1:25:39] mount transfiguration when God adopted
[1:25:42] Jesus Christ. While he has spake,
[1:25:44] behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:25:46] them. And behold, a voice out of the
[1:25:47] cloud which said, "This is my beloved
[1:25:49] son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye
[1:25:52] him."
[1:25:54] Brother Brandham says, "While he was yet
[1:25:57] speaking, God shut him up. He said,
[1:25:59] "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:26:00] pleased. Hear ye him." God put himself
[1:26:03] in the background and said, "This is my
[1:26:06] son."
[1:26:08] You notice what God did in Eden when he
[1:26:11] went to his rest. He put himself in the
[1:26:12] background and gave all of creation over
[1:26:14] to Adam and Adam's wife and said, "This
[1:26:17] is him now. Whatever you say, Adam."
[1:26:20] Yeah. And Adam could speak to nature. He
[1:26:22] could speak through the tree to pluck up
[1:26:24] and move. He could speak. And what did
[1:26:26] God do? He went to take his rest because
[1:26:29] now he had a son on the earth. You know
[1:26:32] what God wants to do in his millennium?
[1:26:34] He wants to do the same thing. He wants
[1:26:35] he brought Christ into adoption. Now
[1:26:37] he's trying to bring the bride into the
[1:26:39] adoption. Amen. So what? So he could
[1:26:40] bring us back to rule and reign with
[1:26:42] Christ for a thousand years. And what's
[1:26:44] he going to do? Take his rest
[1:26:47] and move to the background and say
[1:26:49] that's them. I've trained them. Yeah.
[1:26:53] I've brought them to adoption. I've
[1:26:54] brought them to perfection. They can
[1:26:56] handle the world. Yeah.
[1:27:00] That's what it's all about, friends.
[1:27:01] That's what all of our trials and
[1:27:03] troubles and our growing and everything
[1:27:04] that we've been through. It's all about
[1:27:06] coming to that place where he can say,
[1:27:10] "These are my this is my family. Here
[1:27:13] they are. They're going to rule and
[1:27:15] reign for a thousand years." I say,
[1:27:17] "Thank God." Amen. For the wisdom of our
[1:27:20] father.
[1:27:22] And may God help us to make our homes
[1:27:24] reflect his great desire for family and
[1:27:27] his great picture of family. We We got
[1:27:29] to play our roles. We got to do our
[1:27:31] part. We got to do it faithfully.
[1:27:33] But we we can't diminish from any other
[1:27:36] role. We can't disrespect mother. We
[1:27:39] can't disrespect father. And God bless
[1:27:41] you. You have a song, Blake. Let's sing
[1:27:43] together as we dismiss.
[1:27:46] My father knows what I need.
[1:27:54] My father knows what I need.
[1:28:01] In everything I go through, he knows
[1:28:06] what's best for me.
[1:28:11] My father knows what I need.
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:19] He's got it all in control.
[1:28:27] He's got it all in control.
[1:28:34] He put that reassur
[1:28:38] way down in my soul.
[1:28:44] He's got it all in control.
[1:28:52] I put my life in his hand
[1:28:57] in his hands. I put my life in his
[1:29:03] hands.
[1:29:07] Every road I walk down, I know is in his
[1:29:12] hand.
[1:29:17] I put my life in his hands. My father
[1:29:22] knows.
[1:29:24] My father knows what I need. What I
[1:29:30] need.
[1:29:34] Knows what I need.
[1:29:39] In everything I go through, he knows
[1:29:44] what's best for me.
[1:29:49] My father knows what I need.
[1:29:56] Amen.
[1:29:58] God bless you.
[1:30:00] I just want to be under the direction of
[1:30:02] my father.
[1:30:04] You know what else I'm thankful for? I'm
[1:30:06] thankful for a body of believers that
[1:30:09] loves me. Thankful for people who hug
[1:30:12] your neck and shake your hand and ask
[1:30:13] you how you're doing and create an
[1:30:15] environment and will love at all times.
[1:30:18] I'm thankful for that. Don't want to
[1:30:20] diminish either. We need we need a
[1:30:22] church, but we need a father. I'm so
[1:30:26] glad that in this generation, he's
[1:30:28] presented himself in the full measure of
[1:30:30] himself so that we can come to the full
[1:30:33] revelation of who we are, what he's
[1:30:36] doing in our lives, what he's trying to
[1:30:38] accomplish in us, so there's no more
[1:30:41] confusion.
[1:30:42] So thankful for each one of you. I love
[1:30:44] you all. Such an encouragement to me.
[1:30:47] You're such a source of love and
[1:30:48] inspiration and strength. Your text
[1:30:50] message, your cards, they do me a world
[1:30:53] of good and I need it. I need love and
[1:30:57] encouragement. You need love and
[1:30:58] encouragement.
[1:31:00] I thank God we can have a fellowship of
[1:31:02] believers, a body of believers to
[1:31:03] nurture and care and love and create a
[1:31:05] beautiful environment and a place we
[1:31:07] always want to come back to. I'm
[1:31:10] thankful in this generation we can have
[1:31:11] that and we can have a father on the
[1:31:14] scene to direct us to adoption.
[1:31:17] I believe this is the best generation to
[1:31:19] ever be on earth and we get the
[1:31:21] privilege of the full picture of God in
[1:31:24] this generation. Thank God. God bless
[1:31:26] you all. Let's bow our heads together
[1:31:28] and thank the Lord.
[1:31:30] Lord Jesus,
[1:31:33] God, we thank you, Lord, for your
[1:31:34] goodness to us that we can be alive in
[1:31:37] this day, Lord, in this hour when you
[1:31:40] begin to express yourself in fullness,
[1:31:42] no longer partial, but a full
[1:31:44] manifestation
[1:31:46] through your bride and through your
[1:31:47] word, Lord, as they come together to
[1:31:49] unite to do what, Lord? To reproduce you
[1:31:52] on this earth, God. May we stay true to
[1:31:56] that, Lord, to that purpose above all
[1:31:58] else. May we yield ourselves to that
[1:32:00] purpose. May we surrender to it, Lord.
[1:32:03] May you use each one of us, Lord, as you
[1:32:05] bring us to adoption, Lord. May you deal
[1:32:07] with us each personally.
[1:32:10] And God, I pray if there's anybody here,
[1:32:12] Lord, they've been like Moses who had a
[1:32:15] good mother who would teach them the
[1:32:17] word for their day, would tell them
[1:32:19] about the promise of the hour and the
[1:32:21] promise of Abraham's seed and the
[1:32:23] position that they were in and the
[1:32:25] promise that was in Moses's life. She
[1:32:28] was a good mama and she did her job
[1:32:30] well, but it just somehow didn't change
[1:32:33] Moses. He needed something else, Lord.
[1:32:36] And if there's anyone here that's in
[1:32:38] that spot, they've been hearing the
[1:32:39] preaching. They've been hearing the
[1:32:41] word. They've been hearing the teaching.
[1:32:43] They've been nurtured and cared for and
[1:32:44] loved in the church.
[1:32:46] I pray God that you would present
[1:32:49] yourself to them as a loving father.
[1:32:51] Lord, that you would come to them as you
[1:32:54] did to Moses in the burning bush. May
[1:32:56] there be individuals who meet the pillar
[1:32:58] of fire. May they meet you tonight. May
[1:33:00] they meet you in their homes, in their
[1:33:01] rooms along the way, Lord. May you
[1:33:04] present yourself to them and call them
[1:33:06] out
[1:33:08] to come a little higher, Lord, to come
[1:33:10] into this place where you want to bring
[1:33:12] us into our position and move us, Lord,
[1:33:14] into a relationship with you that'll
[1:33:16] bring us into the fullness of adoption.
[1:33:19] God, maybe there's several, maybe
[1:33:21] there's many that have heard the mother
[1:33:24] teach, but God, they need to hear your
[1:33:27] voice. Speak directly to them that
[1:33:30] you're my son, and I'm bringing you to
[1:33:33] this position. You've heard about it,
[1:33:36] but I'm here to call you into it. Lord,
[1:33:39] would you call tonight? Would you call
[1:33:41] your sons and daughters into the
[1:33:43] position they've been hearing about,
[1:33:45] Lord? They've heard it. They've heard
[1:33:46] the truth. It's right and they're the
[1:33:48] right ones, but they need the father's
[1:33:50] voice to say it's me and you're the one
[1:33:53] and I'm calling you into this position
[1:33:56] to be my bride in this end time. God,
[1:33:58] would you do that work in your children?
[1:34:00] I pray for we love you, Lord. And we
[1:34:03] know only you can do that work. We
[1:34:05] surrender to you. We thank you, Father,
[1:34:08] for all you've done for us, Lord. As you
[1:34:11] lead us through, God, no doubt there's
[1:34:13] testings and trials and things that we
[1:34:15] have to learn, Lord, through the ups and
[1:34:18] the downs and the goods and the bads.
[1:34:20] God, help us not to complain, but help
[1:34:22] us to be thankful that we have a father
[1:34:24] watching over our instruction. You're
[1:34:27] watching over our training and our
[1:34:28] learning, Lord. And you're making sure
[1:34:30] that we're never tried more than we can
[1:34:32] endure. And we're making sure, Lord,
[1:34:34] that that you've provided for everything
[1:34:36] we need. You've given your word in due
[1:34:38] season. You've given your spirit to help
[1:34:40] us go through and may lord we learn just
[1:34:44] to trust you in the journey for you have
[1:34:46] a definite purpose for us. We love you
[1:34:50] father. We love that we can call you
[1:34:51] father. And what greater blessing is
[1:34:53] bestowed upon us than that we are called
[1:34:55] the sons of god. Oh God how we love you
[1:34:58] in this hour. Bless your children as we
[1:35:01] go from here. And may we reflect this
[1:35:02] word in our lives in our homes and our
[1:35:05] persons. We love you. May we as a
[1:35:08] church, Lord, be in our right position.
[1:35:11] May you keep us in that position. And
[1:35:13] may we never fight you for your
[1:35:15] position, Lord. We love you. We ask you
[1:35:18] for these things. May they be a reality
[1:35:19] to us. May they come into a
[1:35:20] manifestation in us all. We pray in
[1:35:24] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:35:28] Amen. Aba father
[1:35:33] take my life and let it be
[1:35:40] consecrated
[1:35:44] Lord to thee.
[1:35:47] Take my moments
[1:35:51] and my days.
[1:35:55] Let them flow in ceaseless
[1:36:00] praise.
[1:36:02] Let them flow in cases.
