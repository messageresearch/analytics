[0:12] oh brother Branham said if the bride
[0:13] could just get her positive position and

[0:18] that this message was for running her
[0:20] the coming word it was it was the
[0:23] forerunning of Jesus Christ in Bride
[0:25] form
[0:27] what is this what is this bride form
[0:29] what is it the bride coming what is the
[0:32] what is this coming out of dark
[0:34] denominationalism
[0:36] it's Christ in Bride form
[0:38] or the bride coming of Christ
[0:41] that is the revelation
[0:44] that's why the bride sees it that's why
[0:46] the bride recognizes it
[0:48] she's the only one that can see that
[0:50] mystery of his coming
[0:54] you say well Brother David you're sure
[0:56] being no I'm not I'm being exactly what
[0:59] I should be to the word bride
[1:01] this is exactly the message she gets you
[1:05] say they're very few oh very few that
[1:06] believe that I don't care how few it is
[1:08] I know that substance in me
[1:15] if I be the only one he said that makes
[1:17] it if you were living here I lived in
[1:18] Lima again I'd be the only one making
[1:20] lime it be me
[1:22] why because I hold that substance that's
[1:25] more real to me than I'm standing here
[1:27] on this platform that's real because
[1:29] that's real
[1:30] that's real because it's eternal
[1:37] you say do you walk in that every day
[1:38] every day well don't you have trials and
[1:41] struggles to test that has nothing to do
[1:42] with my trials struggles and tests I've
[1:44] overcome every one of those already
[1:47] what is it because I'm walking in him
[1:50] I'm putting him before me if I put him
[1:52] before me don't you make a mistake sure
[1:54] I make mistakes but what's that got to
[1:56] do with my relationship with God what's
[1:58] that got to do with the revelation of
[1:59] this substance what that got to do with
[2:01] the revelation of where I came from
[2:04] that doesn't change it
[2:07] glory to God that does not change it
[2:12] you can't pull me out of a relationship
[2:14] with him when I was ordained in Union
[2:16] with him when I was already his thoughts
[2:18] expressed when I was already in his mind
[2:20] are you going to take me away from the
[2:22] relationship with him when I always was
[2:24] related I always was married I was
[2:27] married to him the old man is dead
[2:31] out of existence
[2:33] eternally separated I've been eternally
[2:35] separated that old man is dead
[2:38] eternally separated
[2:40] and come back to what I was in the
[2:42] beginning
[2:45] amen amen and now it's expressing the
[2:47] being that I am
