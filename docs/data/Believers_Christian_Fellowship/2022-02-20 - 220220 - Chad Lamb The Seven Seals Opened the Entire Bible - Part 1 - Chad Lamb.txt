christ's name we pray amen and god bless you all if you could take your bibles while you're standing and turn with me to the book of luke luke chapter 24. say thank you brother tell us for that song i appreciated it very much it was quite a blessing amen i'd like to um i will read this scripture but i'm going to do a little bit of teaching i think this morning you never know for sure how things were going to go sometimes you get in your mind one way and it goes a different way and that's perfectly fine with me but i'd like to do a little bit of teaching and i've got quite a big subject so i made a powerpoint to keep myself on task and i've got a cutoff point and i'm not going to go i don't want to drag this out i want to be able to capture what we're looking at i want to look at it in detail but i want to get in hit the details and i want to stop and continue on wednesday or sunday so i've told you what my intention are we'll see what happens but it's a good intention but let's look at luke chapter 24 verse 25. we know this is the luke 24 is the road to emmaus it begins just above this where two disciples are walking on the road to emmaus and jesus draws near and their eyes are holding they don't know who he is and they begin to tell him about all their troubles and then this is his response in verse 25 then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen god bless you you can be seated but frank if you could help by bringing up that first slide on my powerpoint for me and uh when you look at this road to emmaus now jesus has uh he has been manifest upon the earth he's done what the lord has what the uh god as the father has told him to do he manifests the word amen he was crucified and paid the price of redemption for us and now he is resurrected again but his disciples those who are closest to him have missed what's been happening amen they saw the life they saw the healing they they saw the crucifixion and understood the the you know the capture and the crucifixion and but they're confused about all these events and and so christ draws alongside of them uh and and he comes the other scripture says he come to them in another form amen so in another form he comes to them and he begins to admonish them and rebuke them for not believing all that the scripture sits in they thought they were believing the scriptures but they weren't able to take the current present circumstances and attach it to the scriptures amen so they didn't understand and he begins to admonish them and and verse 27 is the one that interested me the most and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures these things concerning himself what did he do he opened the book he opened to them the scriptures he opened the book and he revealed himself out of the book and they were they were looking at the old testament as books of the bible as a torah as laws and as writings of prophets and as psalms that were written amen by singers they were looking at all of these things but they were missing the whole point of the bible the whole point of the bible was to dare to to declare christ and when christ came he was the declaration of the entire bible and when they missed what was happening he says oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have written you believed some but you didn't believe it all and then he begins in all the scriptures i love this and in the beginning at moses and all the scriptures he took them through the entire bible amen and beginning at moses and all the scriptures expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself so this morning i'd like to take the seven seals open the entire bible jesus in the road to emmaus opened the entire bible to these to these uh disciples along the way he spoke to them starting at moses and all the scriptures the scriptures concerning himself but but then the bible continued to be written amen we have a new testament that came forth after this and at the end of the new testament we saw that there were seven seals that were sealed amen and there was seven thunders that uttered and john was told to seal them up and not to write them but we know that at the end time these things will be unsealed and so the seven seals opened the entire bible this is taken out of a quote and we'll read that i think next yeah and john looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mystery was in the seven seals when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible that's where we get our title from when the seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and then these seven seals held the entire mystery of it all right we know this we believe this a lot of this will be reviewed but i i like the review amen but we go back here to the road to emmaus it says in beginning at moses and all the prophecy expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen and we realize that all that scripture was christ because christ is the word christ is the bible amen and and all of it was pointing to him and every story and every every parable and every type and every shadow was pointing to them and he would go down through the the bible and and maybe he didn't have time to read every verse and every word but he was going down through this is just how i envisioned it he was going down through like brother benham did and he was clipping out clips and showing this is what moses said and this is what jeremiah said remember isaiah and remember joseph and remember remember joseph and do you remember job and do you remember these do you remember these stories amen do you remember hearing them in the synagogue do you remember hearing them amen when you were a child at home amen well that story of joseph was me amen the redeemer job was looking for is me i am the fulfillment of those scriptures and he opened to them amen the entire word and when he opened them to entire word and all the scriptures they all the scriptures were pointing to him and i say that's still true today and so that's what the prophet of god is telling us the mystery was in the seven seals when this these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible amen these seven seals held the entire mystery of it so i'm just gonna stick with my powerpoint here hopefully and we'll just keep moving amen and i stood there a little bit until the holy spirit revealed it i said the entire bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name and all these things has been revealed but there is a secret that's hid inside because the bible is sealed with seven seals so he said you know you remember junior jackson's dream i go over this all the time but i it just is always striking to me how he's going around the outside interpreting the writing on the outside of the pyramid amen when he gets all of that interpreted amen then he he he reaches up and grabs a sharp object out of the air amen and he cuts the top off and inside is white rock that had never been written on and he's told to go out west to get the revelation for that it's a mystery it's unwritten word it's the seven thunders amen that was was thundered but john said don't write it amen there's nothing written it's unwritten word and he was told to go get that so now brother bam saying we've come through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost he's talking about the restoration of the church the restoration of the bride tree the restoration of the word it's coming back and the bible truths have been coming back through the man age amen but he said but there is secrets that's hid inside because the bible is sealed with seven seals i must go there to find it that morning when those seven angels come down and blasted the earth and the rocks flew every way seven angels stood there and said return back to jeffersonville from where you come from for the seven seals of the seven mysteries will be open revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so you have mysteries and you have the mystery there are many mysteries amen but there is there is a singular mystery of god that's being revealed and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so under the mystery is many mysteries many mysteries point to the mystery and the mystery has many mysteries praise be to god but in christ the mystery of god revealed he says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed so we know that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished and brother branham comes in july amen of that year july of 1963 and he says for a text i want to take a text from my sermon basing it upon the entire bible because when you open the seals you open the entire bible so now for his text in july 28 in 1963 he wants to take for his text based in his text on the entire bible and his text is christ is the mystery of god revealed so what did he base that on he based it on the entire bible so the entire bible is christ the mystery of god revealed and i want to look at this i just want to look at this specifically this morning so don't expect me to cover a lot of ground and go far i'm really kind of just focusing down and honing down and focusing on one point this morning so stay with me on this one point i mean there's so much we could preach on and this you can go in so many avenues your mind can go ahead and get five steps ahead of me but slow down just a minute and stay with me because we know so many of these things and so many of them tied together but i want to look at this specifically and lay a foundation because i'm wanting to build off of this into wednesday and maybe into sunday we'll see so christ is the mystery of god revealed so the revelation of christ in the opening of the word is the fulfillment of revelation 10 7. because christ is the mystery of god revealed and brother branham comes in july and preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed and he bases it on the entire bible in the message it is the rising of the sun he says he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is opening of the seals then revealing christ see this is such a wonderful beautiful statement because we can make the seal so many different things and there's so much information in the seals brother branham said i could take one of them seals and preaching around and around that clock i could take a month of services and still not touch it he makes several comments along these lines so you find out there's so much in these seals i don't think we've really begun to understand how much is in the seals i don't know that this life is sufficient but but we keep looking at it we keep focusing on it because this was the capping of brother branham's ministry this was the purpose he was here this is the seventh angels ministry and so we we keep focusing on this what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ so we can look at the seals and go back to the base understanding of the seals and that there is a white horse and what that means and and then a lion anointing and then we could go through all of this information which all of that is critical and all of that is important but we have to realize all of that has to reveal christ because he he's the one who opened the seals he is the seals what is the opening of the seals it's revealing christ so the whole point of the opening of the seals and the preaching of the seals and everything that was preached before leading up to and during and after all of it was to reveal christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed so revelations 10 7 is finished amen under the opening of the seals and the subsequent messages that were preached after that first peter 1 13 says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ when was the revelation of jesus christ given to the bride at the opening of the seals and there was a measure of grace amen the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ amen he is the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again see if see this is why we'll be reading our bibles the rest of our lives this is why we're never going to be able to say i got it now i got the full revelation you may have the revelation of christ in this day the revelation of the open book amen but i'm going to tell you that that revelation goes so deep amen i don't know that will ever come to the end of exploring that and so we'll always be continually reading our bible and discovering christ if you don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again see if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you've missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there is christ see every from that to the amen in revelations is every word testifying of jesus christ so the seals opened up the entire bible the entire bible is the revelation of jesus christ then what is the seals the revelation of jesus christ what is the bible the revelation of jesus christ when he took the oh when he opened the seals he opened up the entire bible you you've got to make the picture look right it's god's great picture and there's only one way you'll see it that when you see jesus christ there is the entire bible he's the principal theme of the bible okay if we go back to the road to emmaus these two uh disciples that are walking down the road to emmaus they made this statement we thought it would have been he that would have delivered now because of the circumstances making a turn you know they they were believing that this was the messiah they were believing this is the son of god that should come they were believing in the miracles and all that but because it took a turn that he didn't expect it to turn turn they didn't expect to make they made the statement we thought it had been he so now there was a question that doubt had entered in and and jesus admonishes him says old fools and slow of heart to believe all all that the prophets wrote you didn't catch at all you were just catching this part amen and then he began to expound the scriptures unto them to correct their understanding or bring them to the correct revelation of jesus christ but but if they had the correct revelation of who this was amen there would have been no question and no doubt to whatever the circumstance would happen amen so now he begins to to reveal himself to them he begins to open the scriptures unto them and open their understanding this is all in luke 24 he opens the scriptures to them but then later he opens their understanding to understand the scriptures amen then he fills them with the holy ghost and empowers them to be witnesses and they go off testifying believing the full word now if they had believed the full word before there would have been no question that he was the one but you could say but they took and nailed him to the cross and you can say i don't quite understand that part yet but it has to fit because of who he is amen so what about your messiah what about your deliverer amen what is this they've they've they've nailed him to a cross amen he's he's dead and he's laid in the sepulchre i saw where they laid him there's guard standing outside amen the correct revelation of who this was would have said i don't know but that has got to be in the word somewhere let me keep reading amen and as i keep reading amen that god will unlock it to me because there's nothing wrong with who this is my revelation of who this is is secure the change in circumstances does not change the truth of who this was and so you see how it takes a divine revelation from god to settle in your heart what this message is this message is christ the opening of the seals was the revealing of christ now if things in our life take a turn if we read things we don't understand and people ask questions we can't answer there's no reason to say well i thought this was christ there's no reason to go back and question amen because a true revelation a genuine revelation from god well says it doesn't matter if i can't answer your question it doesn't matter if even looks like this might be wrong amen i don't know one thing i know for sure that this is christ amen this is the mystery of god revealed in this day this is the truth that's been delivered through a prophetic ministry and been given to the bride i'm not questioning that anymore now i know that question has got to be in this word somewhere because that revelation amen was the entire bible amen i hope we see as we go on that brother branham was a very scriptural prophets amen even when he didn't explain it he was preaching the scriptures he's extremely scriptural so so many times because he doesn't explain he doesn't give the scriptural reference he doesn't uh he doesn't always tie all the pieces together amen that means it leaves many people wondering you know if that was his opinion or the way he felt about something or a statement he made and i just come back to say amen this was the seventh angel amen in the days of his voice the mystery of god shall be finished and christ is the mystery of god and christ is the seals and christ is the bible amen and when the mystery of god was finished it opened the entire bible amen and that that prophet of god was preaching out of that bible [Music] so if he makes a statement amen even if it looks like he might just be making a statement or giving an opinion because he doesn't qualify with scriptures amen do you really think that the man in discussing a situation or answering a question or giving a solution do you really think that the revelation that he had received in the seals did not influence that statement so it was influenced by the open book amen it was his revelation of christ his revelation of the mystery of god his revelation amen that was shaping every answer to every question the things that he would say and the things that he would warn against and the things that he would admonish and rebuke amen they were all shaped by the scriptures because this is the prophet of god who had received the mind of christ for this day and it was the unlocking of the entire bible so he's a very very scriptural prophet and we've had many questions in the past been asked many questions and many things that we could not answer but by the grace of god we can answer today things we could not answer 10 years ago we see and understand through the scriptures things today we didn't understand maybe even two three four years ago what is that there comes a time when god settles it in your heart what this message is and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this message is christ and so the the question you can't answer does not become the stumbling stone it becomes the motivation to look back in your bible again because if brother ben i'm taught it it's in the bible amen so there is the entire bible he's the principal theme of the bible and this message is christ so this message is preaching the entire bible message is christ it's the open book it's the opening of the word it's the revealing of the seals it's the revealing of the mystery of god the finishing of the mystery of god so we are a privileged people i want to keep looking in detail some of these statements he is the principle theme of the bible he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history and he also in the bible was the thing that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever so why is he the same yesterday today and forever because he's always been the word he was the word yesterday he's the word today he'll be the word forever so wherever the word was revealed that was christ and he's the same whatever he was then he's the same now even though the revelation is different in expression it's the same person it's the same one so he's the same yesterday today and forever john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men so we know this scripture we've been through it so many times but in the beginning was the word word was with god the word was gone amen all things were made by him and without him was not anything made and in him was life and that life was the light of men so we have to have him the word to have life and to have light and the seven he says now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of revelation it's the revealing of the seven seals perfectly mute and if i only had time i'll try in a few places to show you all the way back from genesis the seventh chapter this seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in genesis this these seals move right up now i've looked at this i i mean any of us who believe the message for any period of time we've looked at this quote over and over and over again but all of a sudden it just hit me in a deeper way the other day and and i want to share that with you if i only had time and i'll try in a few places i'll show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter the seventh seal is spoke of all the way back from the very beginning in genesis this this seals move right on up and i've always taken and looked at that the seventh seal and i showed the creation of man the creation of adam and his wife with him and coming out bringing her out of him and forming her and uniting the two together amen and that being a great thing and it and it was and that is an expression of the seventh seal but he says from the very beginning in genesis and i want to look at this he said he is the principal theme of the entire bible we had this quote before but i'm highlighting a separate part if you read the bible don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ he's the word when you read in the beginning god created there is christ if you want to find the beginning of the seventh seal there it is go all the way back to genesis 1 1 and if you want to find the start of these seals coming up in the beginning of the seventh seal you go back and when it says in the beginning god created there is christ oh i went back to genesis sure i preached on it back in genesis i didn't go back far enough amen you got to go all the way back to genesis 1 1 and when you go back to genesis 1 1 there you find christ christ is in genesis 1 1 and the bible he is the word he is the word amen the word was with god the word was god he is the word and in the beginning god created there is christ we're gonna find out why and see every from that to the amen in revelations is every word testifying of jesus christ so genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the key lies in how he created in revelation 4 10 he says the four and 20 elders fell down before him that sat on the throne so who did they fall before the one that was sitting on the throne i want you to catch this john is lifted up after the church ages and he caught into a heavenly realm and he first thing he sees is one sitting on the throne and now he sees the 24 others fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created so who created all things the one sitting on the throne god created the heaven and the earth but brother branham said when you read that genesis 1 1 there's christ in the beginning said when it says in the beginning god created heaven and earth there's christ and who created all things the one who's sitting on the throne hebrews 11 tells us now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so in the beginning when it says god created we know that the worlds were framed by the word of god so how did he create he created with his word so in the beginning when it says god created there's christ right there that's christ because christ is the word and god created by his word amen so the worlds were framed by the word of god praise be to god this is so important amen that we understand these seals open up the entire bible now genesis 1 1 is opened up all the way back in the beginning genesis 1 1 is opened up john 1 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he's speaking of jesus this just as john 1 where john 1 1 we just read in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god amen now we come it's describing him coming into the world and it says he was in the world who the word the word was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not now later when we get to verse 14 notice this is verse 10. so verse 1 says in the beginning was the word john 1 1 10 says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not verse 14 says and he was made flesh and dwelt among us so i'd like to say the word has been in the world and the word is christ and christ has been rejected from the very beginning when eve left the word she left christ in the world and he was in the world but he was rejected all the way back in genesis he was rejected because whenever they rejected the word they rejected christ amen the world was made by him and the world knew him not so the worlds were framed by the word of god christ who made it god how did he make it by christ by the word his word which is him and the word was made the world was made by him first john 5 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one so who is christ the word see when brother branham starts saying you know jesus christ is the word he's the word he's the entire bible he is a very scriptural prophet he's preaching exactly what paul preached amen when i mean when we first began to hear i was raised pentecostal i come up all my life i cut my teeth literally on the back of a pew because we had pews back then and and all my life i heard what was called the gospel but really what i wasn't being taught the gospel i was being taught traditional understanding of scriptures which is not the gospel the gospel is a good news today the good news today is the way of salvation today but i thought i was hearing the gospel and i came up and i and i realized that that i wasn't understanding who christ was and i would hear brother branham make statements like and and christ was the word and the word the entire bible is christ and when you have a denominational understanding you see that christ amen comes on earth amen and uh uh you know comes on earth when he's uh injected into the womb of mary amen and mary delivers and there is the beginning of jesus christ that's a denominational understanding so when brother branham said amen that was christ and moses i as the denominational boy i believe it i got a revelation of the message but now as you take time and read through the word and let the truth dictate your understanding of the scriptures amen and let this message amen be true by revelation not because i tell you that it is i could tell you that it is and you're going to get twisted up in all kinds of nonsense trying to make your own understanding work with the bible but when this message is true by revelation then you don't have to twist the bible to fit any previous understanding you take that the the truth the revelation of the message and you let it shatter every previous understanding that we've ever had and come back to the bible and read the bible through the lens of christ because this message is christ so he is the word in revelation 19 13 and he was clothed with a vester dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god this is why when we talk about the message the restoration of the word it is the coming of christ because he is the word we have embraced christ when we've received this word we have rejected christ when we've rejected the word and so we get so many misunderstandings because of traditional teaching and traditional understanding amen but we miss the truth that has been brought to us that he is the word of god in ephesians 3 8 90 says unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ okay now now we know that the bible tells us that in the beginning god created the heavens and earth and by his word the the god framed the heavens were framed by the word of god so now the apostle paul is saying he created all things by jesus christ amen but what form was jesus christ in creating all things amen he was the word or he was the manifestation or the reflection of god he was the thought expressed and the thought expressed was word amen so in john 1 1 when it says in the beginning was the word amen that greek word is logos the word logos means word but it means word with the thought amen including the thought not just a word that you can take and attach another thought to it that's not the word that's why when you can take a bible verse and you can take your own understanding to a bible verse and change it from god's original intention and now make it mean something else that is not the word no matter how much you say it is the word and how much you quote the bible reference amen that is not the word so let's just say let's say you take matthew 28 and you say jesus told them to baptize in the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost and so now we're baptizing according to the way jesus said baptize and they put somebody under under three titles and bring them back up that is not the word you can quote the scripture as you do it you can repeat the phrases out of the scripture but that is not the word because that is not what christ meant when he said that what christ meant was that i want you to baptize in the name singular of the father and the son and the holy ghost and there was one earthly name that god took in his manifestation and that is the lord jesus christ so when you baptize in the name of lord jesus christ amen the trinitarian the uh indoctrinated theologian the high educated scholar amen will take you back to scripture and i've had i've had some people that i've talked to say you know jesus said do it this way peter said do it this way i'll take what jesus said he's better than peter see human reasoning is so childish it misses the it misses how perfect god is amen how beautiful his word is how perfectly he gave us his word amen and it makes god haphazard and somehow god allowed peter to say it wrong and then he allowed some scribe to write it down wrong and that scribe he wrote it down or has been perpetuated wrong but really we got to get back to the original what jesus said was right and why do we even have a bible then if it can't be trusted but you see that's not the word amen quoting scripture is not necessarily the word you say them a lot of places and people want to throw stones at you but this is why we've got over 40 000 denominations if we just think about it amen we understand that just being able to base what you believe amen off of scripture that's been twisted to your understanding that fits your purpose does not make that the thought of god expressed that is now your thought expressed you've taken the ink on paper and changed it from its original intent and changed it to some human intent praise be to god so jesus christ is the word but he is the logos he is the word that is expressing the thought of god and whenever that word is expressing god's thought that is christ that's christ that's why to reject that is to reject christ i can't say that enough amen people think that they have to deny that jesus died 2000 years ago to reject christ amen billions of people believe that jesus died 2 000 years ago amen but to reject the word which is the thought of god expressed in our day is to reject christ you're rejecting the same one that died 2 000 years ago he's the word so he created all things by jesus christ colossians 1 14 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible so who created all things they were created god created all things how did he create it by him who's him the word amen for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers and all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist that makes the word central to everything all things are created by him the word oh and for him the word he is before all things the word is before all things and by him the word all things consist that means our life is totally wrapped up in this word amen this word is what brings light this word is what brings life this word is our life we consist in the word all things consist by the word but what word the word that is the expression of god's thought that is the pure word he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now and who is this melchizedek he says notice now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed so that's when brother bam says god was alone with his thoughts it wasn't yet nothing was expressed there was no expression this was god with his attributes all of his thoughts now i want to say i'm going to skip back because i get this feeling you're reading ahead i'm not a super sensitive person but i just have that sense so what first was was the god with his attributes with his thoughts that was gone and god's thoughts are real they're they're they're not uh fairy tales they're not something that he changes they're literal they're permanent they're everlasting they are eternal they are his thoughts are himself now you say now those thoughts were expressed and and we are one of those thoughts if we're a predestinated seed of god with the gene of god then we were in his thinking then we're one of his thoughts now now i want you to just hang with me for just a moment amen as i as i try the best i can to explain something as i see it no doubt when god saw the plan of redemption before the foundation of the world he did because he wrote a book called the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and he was the lamb slain from before the foundation world so in god's thoughts christ was slain to pay the price of redemption to redeem back that had been fallen so that means in god's thought he understood there would be a fall and if he understood there would be a fall he knew there would be bad characters in that fall and he knew that subsequently there would be air that would come into the church and and god knew the end from the beginning so you cannot say those thoughts are eternal and those thoughts are god right because he knew there would be those who wouldn't be saved in the end is that right but when god when you talk about god alone with his thoughts it's his thought of himself and how he wishes to express himself that's the attributes and in that plan to have an expression of himself amen that expression in order to be understood has to fall against the backdrop of black so the contrast will show god and all of his characteristics show him as a healer because their sickness show him as a savior because there's need of salvation you understand so god as brother matt says the great architect starts laying on his plan as he's laying out his plan he knows that in order to show this attribute there has to be this contrast and for this attribute has to be is contrasted and and and then the lamb is going to have to be slain from before the foundation world there's going to be need for a slain lamb there'll be somebody who will take him and kill him right god is an architect he he saw this out but but the attributes that he was along with was himself the thoughts of himself and how he would express himself in each one of those expressions of god are called attribute or thoughts so if you are on earth to express god then you were there that day as one of his attributes as thoughts you are here to express what he was thinking back then which is how he will express himself so you are part of himself being expressed that's what makes you the word you're not all of the word you're part of the word you may be one little speck of the word but i don't care if it's a microscopic speck the word is the word it's eternal it's his thought it's his attribute it's part of himself so we we can never claim that we're all the word or i may not even be a great big part of the word i might even be just a little bitty teeny part of the word but i'm satisfied with it being the smallest grain of the word that i can be i'm still satisfied amen i'm still thoroughly satisfied because if i'm the smart and they know i don't think god has big thoughts and little thoughts you know what i'm saying but in our own perspective if i'm just the littlest grain of the thought of god that means i was eternal with him and i'm part of his expression and his plan to express himself in this expression that makes me part of the word that gives an eternal eternal quality to me praise be to god that's why brother bremen could say it's not the flesh that comes predestinated not the dirt that you live in it's that seed of god that thought of god that expression that's what becomes predestinated and because that is predestinated and predetermined express god all the dirt that he gathers around you now is predestinated dirt because it's expressing the predestinated life inside praise be to god amen now now let's go back to who's this milk is today then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so he's throwing three stages of the progression i kicked back so you can't read ahead i'm wise enough first you have the eternal thoughts of god which the eternal thoughts of god are the thoughts about himself now that's just my terminology that's not what the way brother branham explained this is just the way i understand it so forgive me i may adjust it later but the thoughts god have of himself of how he will express himself are eternal thoughts and because he wants to express himself in me i'm part of those eternal thoughts so i'm part of god at the beginning but god in his great condensation when he would come into full expression he first had thoughts and when those thoughts began to express the thoughts came the expression came from the thought and that expression that came from the thought was the logos or the word which is the thought expressed now however the thought is expressed is word that's the expression of the thought and that word that expressed he called sun it takes the title of son but it's not different than him it came from him it's an extension of him to play another role all right and then that word that came from god that was with god that was god that word was taken and put into a body of flesh amen in jesus christ at 2 000 years ago and now it becomes manifested word okay so we have thought expressed is word coming to earth and it's season of manifestation is manifested word there's three stages amen to this and it all links back to god it all comes from god it is all part of god it is all expressing god so wherever you find yourself amen how can you separate it from god you find yourself down here you're here in 2022 and in 2022 you're here to express christ in the formation of the bride your little part your little life the little things that you do and interact with that little snapshot you're here to express bride of christ in your body of flesh if you're here to express that then you were in the logos when the word came out of god you were there when it came out as logos it was a theophany a form an expression something that could now be seen you were there i mean if you were there then you were in his thoughts when he was alone with his thoughts so where do you draw the separating line where do you say what's part of god and what's not part of god what's an expression of god and what's not an expression god it all links back to one head which is god the thought the father the originator the origin of everything is the thought the father the expression is the sun and further expressions are sons and daughters little clinkers off the clinker little clinkers off the sun our sons and daughters have gone you see friends when the seven seals opened it opened the entire bible it was so much more than just a an understanding of some doctrines and a correction of dying all the correction of the doctors was pointing back to the same thing it was pointing back to the origin in the original purpose oh i gotta quit i'm getting too far ahead i told myself i'm not gonna do this i think it's partially your fault he expressed secondarily he became the word and then the word was made flesh and one among us saint john the first chapter in the first verse notice this in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where melchizedek is he's preaching who's this melchizedek he's talking about melchizedek was an expression of the word in theophonic form amen it was a theophany of god expressing the thought of god and that's theophany can take many different shapes and forms the pillar of fire is the theophany of the word amen so that's where you get to where this melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then the word become flesh and dwelt among us hold that there now notice his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh and a theophany then the thought comes into an expression the expression comes into a manifestation all right it's called the word a body this then is the state that he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word again and who is his milk is it now god in this stage it's this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus so god listen now god in this stage who was that in milk is it what state it was another stage of an expression of god now god in this stage is this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in morphy later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all us sinners there he's talking the three stages again he says first first he is the spirit in great beginning spirit now now then come down to be the word bring itself out so the thought begins to express amen the word doesn't yet make itself the word doesn't yet make itself he's talking about down into flesh and this manifestation it just spoke out in morphing so it turned from thought to a spoken word to an expression of the thought and then later become flesh right i'm going to try to draw this out i hope this helps i know there's all kinds of different ways to express things and people learn in different ways but i just thought i would try to express it this way you have thought an expression and there may be even be better words to use to express this this is just the way that i can express it and then manifestation all right so if i could go up here and every time i draw pictures i'm embarrassed so you've seen these little caricatures a little thought there's first a thought and then there's an expression right some sort of expression and then there's a manifestation and the manifestation is light whatever manifestation if it's in flesh if it's in manna on the ground the manifested word is light if you look at this you have in the beginning i'll just write it across the bottom here you have god's thought of light right god thought about light in this world in this creation he thought about light then he spoke light and then later light appeared brother braham said it could have been hundreds of years later you have here jesus or god thought of jesus he spoke the prophecy and then he made flesh amen so you see the the expressions of god the thought was the original when in creation when light appeared that was not the original the original was the thought so the original is with the father the originator of everything the original is thought sometimes we think the original is what we see but by the time we see it that's just a reflection of the original an expression a manifestation of the original but the original is thought that's why it's so important that the expression matches the thought and the manifestation matches the expression which matches the thought it all has to go back to the original and this path of of god manifesting himself any time we deviate from the original we're no longer carrying the life of the original with us it becomes perverted life so in order for it to be true an expression of god it has to stay true from thought to expression now that expression many times was misunderstood when isaiah said a virgin shall conceive there was a lot of misunderstanding that went about that expression maybe it's the virgin nation of israel maybe it's the virgin daughter of the high priest for this day and that nobody in that day knew was going to be 700 years later a virgin in an obscure little town an obscure little out of the way place they didn't foresee that they got the the expression the expression was true absolutely perfectly true but it can become very much misunderstood and the misunderstanding is not god's fault because if we got if we want understanding on the word and then we need to stop our education and pray for revelation because revelation on the word will bring the original thought to that word and make it the correct manifestation amen this is this is god's way now we're still talking about the opening of seals open the entire bible but i hope you're seeing now that this is the entire bible the entire bible amen the entire bible was god's thought expressed and most of the bible or much of the bible contains the manifestation of that expression it was manifested in moses it was manifested in the exodus it was man that was the manifestation and then god keeps speaking manifesting speaking manifesting but it all ties back to his original thought that's the original all right let's keep going now hebrews 1 1 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake and time passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son who he hath appointed heir of all things by whom he also made the worlds so who did he make the worlds by his son who's his son the word amen and who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so i i want to focus on this uh by whom he made the worlds we know he made the worlds by the word we know by the word of god the worlds were framed that god created it all but he did it by his word and that word is an express thought and that expressed thought is called sun it has the title of sun so he made the world by his son who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person so now that son is a perfect reflection of the father that if you want to see the father you need to look at the son because the son is the expression of the original thought of the father and now he is the express image of the father that's what make jesus christ amen unique in all of creation because all of the word was in him and all of the word was made flesh in him and he became the perfect expressed image of god if you wanted to see god what would god be if god was in flesh look at jesus christ because that's god and flesh he's the express image and his life was so perfect amen that that the manifestation matched every scripture that's why on the road to the road to emmaus he could say he could take them back to moses and expound unto them through all the scriptures the scriptures concerning himself because the expression the manifestation of his life on this earth was a perfect reflection of the expressed word coming through all the prophets and that word coming through all the prophets was a perfect expression of the thought of god because those prophets weren't speaking their own word they were speaking god's word so the word that they spoke amen contain the thought so that word contained the original thought and when it was expressed the manifestation was perfect and that was jesus christ that's why he and the father or the he and god are the same thing because it's god's thought manifest and expressed in flesh and he becomes the perfect reflection of god not the father because the father is the originator to thought this is the son that came out of the father another expression of god another expression in manifestation but the expressed image of his person now there's and the message there's a man here that can turn on the light god's word comes only by the bible god's bible the the printed form of the son of god now we know why the prophet said this because of all the scriptures that we've just read the printed form of the son of god so brother brahm said this is god in letter form because it's the thoughts of god and letter form he said this is the printed form of the son of god because the son of god is the word that came from the father the printed form of the son of god because the bible said that is the revelation of jesus christ it's god it's god revealing himself through christ and christ is the word and it takes the light of god to shine upon that word to vindicate it to prove that god still speaks life eternal life he speaks natural light brings life the life only comes by the light the word made manifest or made flesh we talked about this i believe it was on wednesday night life only comes by the light the word may manifest or made flesh when that word is the expressed thought is made manifest if it's lined up all the way back to the original thought that manifestation is light and that light will bring life that is the purpose of the manifested word in each age and each age god's thought had been expressed in word that word come into manifestation that manifestation became light and that light brought life it's always been god's plan it's still god's plan first john 1 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light that means a present tense a current light if we'll walk walk is not stationary walker's movement so if we're moving in the light as he's in the light the whole terminology gives the image of movement so that means the light is not stationary it wasn't stationary in the exodus they had to walk in the light as he was in the light when the pillar of fire moved that was their light they moved with the light amen it's it is foreshadowing the movement of the church the church moves with the pillar of fire as the light of the manifested word moves the church moves with it and if you walk in the light as he's in the light it didn't say if you sit in the light as he sits in the light so you could sit in the light and refuse to walk and then find yourself outside of light and the light brings life so you can find yourself outside the life but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins he says god is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age god has revealed in every age by his promised word to that age so if you want god find his promised word for that age because god is revealed i just love the way the prophet says this i we would skim over these statements and read them and read them yeah yeah yeah but not understand the full impact of what he's saying god is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age so god wants to be revealed in this age how will he be revealed in this age by the promised word for this age not the promised word of a previous age but the promised word for this age will be god revealing himself now if you want to get somebody to a church or to a denomination or or to understanding that's fine to go to a previous manifestation but if you want to connect people to god you must bring them to a current manifestation a current revelation so you can see many people are content just attaching people to a denomination attaching people to a church to a ministry that that's fine if that's the objective then you can attach people to previous life it's not that that wasn't true it's absolutely the truth nobody's going to say it's a lie it's the truth but god is revealed god has revealed in every age by his promised word to that age and if you walk in the light as he is in the light see see the whole principle we must move when god moves and we must be where his expressed word is being manifest and vindicated and where it's being manifest brings god's thought his life comes all the way down through that channel revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john this is the opening of the book of revelation so what is the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ brother branham says i believe it's in the church age he said many say the revelation of john he said it's not the revelation of john it's the revelation of jesus christ so the rev the book of revelation this is why amen it was a book of symbols that had been probed at for generations but nobody could unlock the mysteries in the book of revelation because because god was going to send a prophet in the end time to bring the revelation of the entire scripture in the opening of the seals and that prophet was going to be the one who opened the book of revelation amen and had the correct interpretation of the symbols so the revelation of jesus christ so the book of revelation could not be revealed until the end time it took the seventh angel amen because he said he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant john so it took his angel to come and bring it to his servant john so in the end time the seventh angel amen will unlock the mystery the revelation of jesus christ which will unlock the entire bible and the book of revelation contains that mystery so the book of revelation caps off the entire bible or i would say it this way the book of revelation seals the bible because it's the last book of the bible but through a prophetic ministry in our day he's going to give us the revelation of jesus christ which is the unsealing of the book of revelation and when the book of revelation is unsealed it unseals the entire bible that's the open book that's the open word christ is the mystery of god revealed he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it the message shalom he says rise and shine for the light has come to you the word light is vindicated the only way as god was jesus christ was the manifestation of god's spoken word the light of the hour john the baptist was the light of the hour he was the light before jesus was light the prophet isaiah said a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord and make straight his path that was the spoken word of god it was laying there hadn't come to life yet malachi the last prophet 400 years before it taken place he said behold i send my messenger before me to prepare the way of the lord here come one out of the wilderness with the without denomination without creed without identification but his light identified him the word identified him they said are you the messiah he said i'm not but i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord jesus said you did walk in his light so that means john had light because he was the manifested word for that hour and there was light and jesus even declared he said you did walk in his light he was a bright and shining light for a while why until the wave was prepared then his light went out the light transferred to the current manifestation which was jesus christ the son of god so it wasn't that john didn't have light john was the light but that light was going to transfer to the word made flesh for that season brother says you can't walk in that light you baptist referring back to john the baptist this is the light of the hour the light has come rise and shine the word light word the manifested word of god identified is a light that is the light for this hour again in shalom he says but did you notice before the seven seals was revealed before the great mysterious light showed forth in the heavens up there at above out above tucson so what did brother banham call that cloud a light look at this again before that great mysterious light showed forth in the heavens up there above tucson flagstaff what's he saying light amen it's a light it was the light it's the light of the hour it's the light of the age it's the revelation of jesus christ it's the manifestation amen coming for a vindication to reveal the word for this hour the light is coming that's why he can preach and shalom rise and shine the light has come did you see that mysterious light in the sky amen while we were there brother fred two of these men the two men was with me that morning when i had been told months and months ahead of time what happened but both brother fred sofiman and brother gene norman sitting there this morning when it was there when the blast went off and not knowing these things would take place and he sent me back said that the time was at hand for these seven seals which held the seven mysteries of the entire bible was sealed in with those seven seals and how those angels down along the road messengers of the church ages opened to a certain part of that but in the seventh hour the seventh messenger that all these mysteries should be finished see the seventh earthly messenger this angel that he speaks of then was on earth an angel means messenger and then after that he saw another angel come down not the earthly angel that had been given the message here but another mighty angel come from heaven with a rainbow over him and set his foot on the land and see and swear by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more sea but before he broke forth on those seven seals to reveal them that he showed miraculously miraculous he showed it first in the heavens so catch this statement brother branham's saying before he broke in on those seals to open which he showed at miraculous and the opening of the seals before that he showed it in heaven first that light that mysterious light that day they took pictures all across southern united states and mexico there it hangs now in life magazine still a mystery to them but he declares it in the heavens before he does it on earth he always does that he shows his signs in the heavens first what's he coming to he's coming to give the revelation of the seven seals he's coming to open the seals but before he comes to do what he's going to do he shows the sign in the heaven first there's a mysterious light there and we see it as the cloud brother bear said it hangs in life magazine yet what is it it's the capping off of the church it's the capstone we know the capping the final word the capstone revelation is coming down upon the earth and brother branham was told a few months later to take the picture and turn it to the right and he took the picture and he said turn it right and he turned it to the right and he said there's christ see his eye see his nose see his mouth now remember this was the sign he showed in heaven's first before he did it on earth so then what's he going to do amen bring a revelation of seven new doctrines and you've got to study the seven no what's happening he's revealing the headship christ it's christ the opening of the seventh seals the sign shows what he's going to do on earth what's he going to do on earth he's bringing christ to the church amen all of christ the full mind of christ the full revelation of the entire bible is coming to earth to unite with the body with the bride that's what the sign declares the capstone is christ it's the finishing of the bible it's the opening of revelation which the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ but when he turned it to the right he recognized who it was that was coming it's the one the revelation is all about amen what is those seals christ christ is he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals what is the opening of the seals revealing turn it to the right that's what the opening of the seals was showing who could open the seals when he could open the seals why he opened the seals and who it was the sign shows when he opened those seals it opened the entire bible and the headship the mind the intelligence the understanding the identification take out your wallet and get your id how much of your body is shown in your id that's why brother branham says what identification this is identifying what this word is this opening of the seven seals was the revealing of christ and it unlocked the entire bible to show us the great plan of god from before the foundation of the world all the way through and every scripture speaks of christ and when he come down he come to declare himself it wasn't new doctrines to have new doctrines it was giving us a spiritual understanding and a scriptural understanding of the day and the hour that we lived in and peeling back the mystery and we'll get to that maybe next time peeling back the mystery of the previous 2000 years and beyond so that we would understand but before he did it on earth he showed it in heaven the question is what did he show in heaven he showed it was the headship the mind the capstone the finish the finishing of the church was coming the completing of the word was coming down the finishing of the revelation and manifestation was coming the the seven angels made his wig what are the seven angels showed the seven the seven ages all completed what is this it's the completion of all seven ages it's the finishing of his whole work through the new testament making outlining the headship what was those seven angels outlining they were framing the headship so that you would see christ in the revelation of this day that's why if we if we get in this message and all we can see is god sent a prophet all we can see is brother branham you haven't seen the sign yet you don't know what the opening of the seals was about you haven't turned the picture to the right why would brother branham have to come back when christ has already come what do you come back for the headship's here the identification is here identifying who this body is and what did the identification come to do the headship come down to identify his body his bride how did he identify his bride amen by bringing a revelation upon the earth and that revelation when it's received is an identification when you receive the headship identifies you as part of the body this headship is your identification amen this message is christ it is your identification it identifies you as bride how does it identify me as bride i never spoke in tongues i never saw a vision you saw christ amen you saw christ in this message you saw the opening of the seven seals you saw the entire bible ripped wide open and you believed all of it that is the identification of the bride that headship coming down if somebody tries to make the identification some other kind of identification they've missed the identification that's coming this hour and it opened up the entire bible and you've been identified with him your bridegroom your headship zechariah 4 7 who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto him why will he shout grace grace because until then amen there's doubts amen there's questions there's there's who is the bride what is the church is it this denomination that denomination this understanding who's right who's wrong where do i go how do i know that this is the original thought becoming manifestation how do i find light so what god did is he brought the light he showed the light he showed it in the heavens before he brought it through the preaching what is it it's your identification you are identified with your headshed oh that's grace grace to me somebody can say you have to understand this and you've got to understand that you have to have this manifestation you have to have this you have to have this level of cleaned up life even after the revelation brother branham he still lied to the lawyer did he have a level of purified life that proved that he had united with the headship do you believe he united with the headship yes it was the holy ghost that brought him to a repentance that's why we look at this headstone coming down and and jerubal was crying bringing the heads on with shoutings of grace grace unto it and i say grace grace marvelous grace we now know the truth and we know who god is we know who christ is we know where he can be found we know how to embrace him we know how to weep at his feet we know how to wash his feet with our tears and our hair what is he he is this anointed word that has been delivered to us the headship has come down and we know where to embrace him we know where to worship him we know where to love him grace grace and that identification becomes my identification and i want to read this scripture again first peter 1 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ i say it's amazing grace you didn't earn the revelation you didn't decide that you were going to become a message believer many of you didn't even know what a message was never heard of it before didn't even know what a term message was didn't know that there were seven seals to be opened had no idea that the bible was the revelation of jesus christ had no idea that the book of revelation was the yeah we had no idea what was it it was his grace and bringing that identification and something inside of you was triggered by the spirit of god that said that ain't nothing but the truth brother branham that is my lord up there he said what is it that's my lord up there and something and you said that's my lord up there somebody else will look up that and say that's some kind of funny para paranormal event we have to explain it but you said when he said that's my lord up there you said that's my lord up there what is it it's grace grace the headstone coming with shoutings of grace and the grace that is be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ not what you earned not what you've done but what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world has come to be made manifest and when you find yourself by faith as part of that it goes it brings you all the way back to the father and then he's your father individually independently he's your father that is grace friends nobody can take that away from you nobody can change that position you yourself can't take yourself out of that position it was in god's thinking before the foundation world that is grace and this grace has come to us at the revelation of jesus christ because it unlocked the entire bible god bless you friends let's all stand musicians if you come let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for the privilege lord the absolute privilege you've given us of having eyes to see and ears to hear god truly great prophets and great men of old long to see this day truly they desired lord if they could have just seen the picture of the capstone coming down they would have been inspired and been thrilled god we have it on our phones and we have it in our wallets and hanging on our walls if they could have just been here the day then they knew to take the picture and turn it to the right and see you and see your identification coming to unlock the word god those things that those mighty men and prophets were probing at and desiring to know lord you've unlocked it for us in this day what grace what amazing grace what abundant grace how could we not love you more lord how can we not worship you how can we not give you our lives how can we not surrender every idea every fantasy every thought every besetting sin how could we not lay it down lord and give ourselves completely to you for the grace that has come to us at the opening of the seals lord we ask that you would bless us now let us go forth lord and be a true manifestation of your true expressed word which comes from your original thought help us lord to yield to that so that you might have preeminence so that you can finish the work that you desire to finish through us in this day we commit ourselves completely and holy unto you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you we love you all this is the greatest day to be alive these are the most wonderful things to talk about what else do you want to talk about i mean there's other things
