TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this isn't about being deep this isn't about being revelated this is about your identification it's about looking in the mirror of God's word and saying mama that's me that's me I was part of God I come from God I'm going back to God I'm not afraid of not making the ratcher I'm not afraid of falling apart I'm Not Afraid why because he's revealed to me my part in the book when the book was sealed I was sealed in the book when the book was unseal my identity was unsealed to take away fear and scare and all these tactics of the devil amen is it simple is it plain to you oh my goodness we can go into all kinds of details that'll make your head spin and my head spin amen there's so many details why it's the revelation of Jesus Christ how you going to put it how you going to boil it down to three words he's all and in all you could talk about it forever he's going to be unfolding himself throughout eternity we can talk about it from every angle you want to talk about it we can use all kinds of language and words we can never come to the end of it but when you boil it all down it keeps coming back to the same Revelation that you are part of God you were with him before the foundation of the world you were in his mind that mystery that he had in the back part of his mind included you as an individual and he come to the end time to take the seals off so that you could see who you really are amen praise God is it simple Yes is it complex yes is it easy to understand yes is it deep Beyond understanding yes amise Lord praise God I love it I love it on the surface I love it in the depths I love it in the Mysteries I love the part I understand I love the part I don't understand I love realizing I thought I understood and still didn't understand when somebody else I like that too I want God to be unsearchable I want it to be the unsearchable riches of Christ I don't want to come to the end of Revelation I don't want to bump into it and say well that's it that's all we're going to get God's not going to reveal himself anymore I want a god whose resources never run out I want a god who's beyond my understanding I want a God that I can't boil down and put in my bottle and control in any way I want a God that's bigger than anything I've ever comprehended far beyond my understanding I want a God that wants to be searched and found and wants to unveil himself to his children I want a god who's new every day I want a god who's constantly revealing himself to me I want him deep I want him wide I want him shallow I want him on the surface I want him in the depths I want him in the cracks I want him in the crevices I want him in plain sight I want him everywhere that's what this Revelation is it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and what is Jesus Christ Christ the word what is the word the very thought of God being expressed he is the anointed word for our day which is fullness not partiality
