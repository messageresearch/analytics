under your control as we break the bread of life Lord may you give us the isab to see we ask ask for these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all and certainly good to be here together again we appreciate that special this evening and the sisters who saying it and then while you're standing let's just go to the Bible to First Corinthians I'd like to continue with the same thought from Sunday and there's just a few more things there's some notes that I skipped over and some thoughts I wanted to share so we're going to continue on with that I did speak to brother Emanuel today in um he said brother Burley is actually returning home tomorrow but he's staying an additional week so brother Emanuel will stay until uh Thursday September 5th so please remember to keep him in your prayers he'll be flying solo now have no help he'll be doing the work himself but uh he said there was quite a few requests quite a few uh pastors who were requesting more meetings so he felt in his heart to stay and do that so I'm quite sure he'll be very busy this next week so please be praying for him also wanted to let you know that that sister Pat McKenna passed away and some of you may know her husband brother McKenna was actually the first Pastor in the Lima area to carry the message but the family has asked brother Gabe Smith to do the funeral so he'll be doing that funeral this Saturday there'll be a viewing on Friday evening and a funeral Saturday so please remember our brother Gabe in prayer that the Lord will inspire him and bless him to be a blessing to the family there and bring honor to the name of our sister amen so just remember him in prayer let's look together at 1 Corinthians chapter 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 21 we read this scripture uh Sunday but I want to start with it now uh 1 Corinthians 1:21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and God bless you as you have your seats it's amazing he didn't it didn't please the god to use the foolishness of preaching just to save them that heard but to save them that believe amen so God was going to use the foolishness of preaching the preaching of the word to save his children but he was going to save them that believe so it required two parts it required the preaching of the word but it also required a heart that could believe the word it wasn't one-sided amen and that's what we begin to look at on Sunday and something I want to continue to look at it wasn't that that you can just come under the anointed preaching of the word and the inspired preaching and the true word and then all of a sudden under the inspired preaching of the true word that everybody sits there and everybody hears and everybody who even intellectually comprehends what's being said that doesn't mean that that's going to do the work but that's the method he's going to save Amen to save his children but he's going to save those that believe amen but those that believe have to hear the foolishness of preaching God's working with both sides now we looked at the word save here and uh we discussed this Sunday but I want to just bring it back to your remembrance the Greek word is soo uh and and it means to save to make whole to heal to be whole so it doesn't like like I said before many times we get understanding and ideas of what it means to be sa saved amen because of denominational ideas but this word save in the Bible actually means to save or or or to rescue but also to make whole to heal one of the meanings is to to save keep safe and sound to rescue from danger or destruction also to save a suffering one uh for example one's suffering from disease to make well heal restore to health to preserve one who is in danger of Destruction to save or to rescue so God is using the full foolishness of preaching to save them that believe amen and like we said before this this scripture actually confused me a little bit through the years because I thought why do we continually come back to the foolishness of preaching if we're already saved but the reality is we still need to be made whole we still need healing amen this healing from this disease of hybridization amen of all the afflictions that have come upon us because we were born wrong in this Human Experience we have is the foolishness of preaching that's saving us making us whole restoring us and keeping us rescuing us from danger and destruction let's go to Psalms 107 now Psalms 107 107 and let's begin reading at verse 19 19 and 20 then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distress he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions so when God was going to heal them and deliver them from their destructions when they Cried unto him and their distress he saved them what did he do he sent his word amen so that's how God Saves that's how God heals that how God delivers from destruction is he sends his word praise be to God amen now let's go and look back at Luke 8 I started with this on Sunday but I want to briefly review it and move from there it's amazing when we listen to the prophet of God he's over and over talking about the word the word the word the word the word so much about the word because we realize this is the age that the word is being restored and the word is having an effect in this day and it's bringing about everything that was prophesied in the word is coming to culmination under the preaching of the word and the restoration of the word because he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from destruction what's delivering us because in this day he sent his word He restored back the word that had been lost through the through the church ages he sent his word and he's healing us and delivering us from destruction in Luke chapter 8 verse 4 this is the parable of the seed swer he says in uh Luke 8:4 and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city spake by a parable and a serwer went out to sew his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the thorn sprang up with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit 100 fold when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptations fall away and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience man so we looked at this Parable and we begin to see that there was only one place that the seed would grow to bear fruit and that was in good ground and we begin to talk about the ground uh that we talked about predestinated ground good ground because the good ground had been cleared the good ground had been cleared of rubble cleared of thorns the good ground had been plowed the good ground had been prepared there was good ground ready to receive the seed amen and the ground didn't prepare itself amen it was somebody else the farmer the husbandman who knew that seed was going to come who made sure there was ground ready to receive the seed so the seed swer was tossing seed everywhere amen and the seed is the word of God the word of God is going everywhere it's being it's being uh broadcast all the time amen but there's good ground amen that if this seed can fall into that good ground that the husbandman has prepared to receive this seed then it'll bring forth a Bountiful Harvest now there's a a couple things I want to look at here the the there was only one place now the seed is the word of God the word of God Amen is powerful the word of God is quick and sharper than any two-edged sword the word of God has life in it amen the word of God is God God is his word amen is that what that what the prophet told us amen but yet as powerful as this word is this word would only replicate itself when it fell in the good ground this this word as powerful as it was didn't have the power Amen to replicate itself and come to maturity and bear forth the fruit of the life inside only when it fell in this one spot so now the seed needs the ground and the ground needs the seed and when these two entities come together then the life of the seed will come into the ground spring forth amen and now begin to Bear a life amen and now the ground will be covered covered with another life and you won't see ground anymore all you'll see is fruit of this seed amen you'll look and say you won't look at a field and anymore say there's dirt that's not dirt that's wheat but the wheat needed the dirt but you don't look at the field anymore and say that's dirt you say that's wheat and the only place that that seed can convert amen and and come into maturity and manifest the life in side is only in the good ground okay so that becomes really important so God Amen God's agenda is to put these two things together to put his word together with the good ground amen then bring his word to life and manifestation the to manifest the life that's in the word amen so now uh in the in the message again God's power to transform there's a couple quotes that I'm going to read today that I read again on Sunday I'm going to I'm just going to bring it to your memory but there's some others that I skipped over a few pages but I'm going to go back and many of them again are out of either God's power to transform or the power of transformation and he says and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God God put the seed in there with potentials and it would be what he said it would be so the life in the seed was already in the seed it was already the potential there the life was there Amen to bring it to bring it to whatever life was in it it had the power to manifest itself but it was going to have to fall into good ground and in the right conditions then it would go through the process but the life was already in it the power to transform itself from seed back to the plant back to Fruit again but it was going to require the conditions were right further down the same quote and he said and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be this is absolutely So Glorious because God has an idea of what he wants his bride to be in this age and he knows exactly what he wants to manifest in order for him to manifest in his guarden of you all the things that he wants to manifest amen he's going to have to send a seed and in that seed is his word and in that seed has the power to transform itself into the very life that's in the seed so God now amen in order to get us to be a Garden of Eden for him a garden for our bridegroom amen he didn't ask be dirt to all the a sudden become a flourishing Garden what he did is asked you to yield to the hand of the farmer amen and he would put the right seed in the right spot in the right time in the right season and all of a sudden before you know it he's got a lush Garden amen with every fruit and every all the fruits of the spirit and all the Life of Christ reflecting the very nature of the husbandman is now reflected in the garden because he knows that the life is in the seed he's not asking the garden amen you Garden just produce pomegranate the garden couldn't produce pomegranate he had to sew pomegranate into the garden to get pomegranate that's why in this age when he wanted a bride to stand in His image he had to bring a word with the life in the word to reproduce itself but he had to find good ground predestinated soil for it to drop into praise be to God and listen the reason I'm preaching this is because we get so discouraged because I'm not yet bearing pomegranates and I'm not yet doing this and I'm not yet doing that but listen friends the power is in the seed the power is in the word just keep receiving the word keep opening your heart let it fall into the good ground that God has predetermined will be the ground for that seed to come in and let it go through the process and bring forth life have confidence in the seed amen we've too long looked in the mirror to try to figure out if it's working or not amen I don't know about you but looking in the mirror is a good place for me to get discouraged but I need to look into this mirror and I need to see that the he sowed the right seed he's going to have the right Harvest he's not going to fail amen let's look together at ISA Isaiah turn with me to Isaiah chapter 7 Isaiah chapter 7 and let's look at verse 14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel so here through Isaiah the prophet God sends out his word he sends his word out and he and he swws this word out into the world this was a thought of God and now the thought of God is being expressed as a spoken word coming from Isaiah amen and this word this prophecy has the power within itself to replicate itself that's right that's right it's the word of God is it not the word of God with the thought of God has the very thought within it amen to replicate itself but for 700 years the prophet of God told us that prophecy was moving about wandering it was it was moving over the Earth what was it doing it was waiting for a beding ground to fall into so that it could reproduce itself that's let's go to Isaiah 55 together Isaiah 55 55 and 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it that means when God speaks a word it is going to come to pass amen there's nothing going to hinder it nothing going to stop it now when God said a virgin shall conceive it didn't matter how many wrong interpretations they had it didn't matter how many people had misunderstood what he meant by that tried themselves to bring it to pass tried to interpret it had that had no bearing on the power that was in that word cuz when God sent the word it shall accomplish the thing he sent it for and it shall not return unto him void but it will accomplish that which he sent it for so though though it's a 100 years now 200 years pass then 300 years pass and Isaiah the prophecy Isaiah keeps marching on and on and then people may the Jews may have believed oh it's already prophesied it's already fulfilled and the Virgin of Israel's this and that and no it will be when when this and this happen it doesn't matter none of that matters because that is God's word that come out of his mouth and it has the power to replicate itself in God's due season in God's appointed place it won't return it doesn't matter what people do with it doesn't change the fact that the word is perfect doesn't matter how many people fail while they wait doesn't matter how many people fall away and the waiting period it doesn't matter how much confusion surrounds that prophecy none of that matters because that prophecy will complete the task it was sent for amen and won't return to him void so let's go to Luke chapter 1 now let's find the landing spot the landing pad for this prophecy Luke chapter 1 in verse 26 Luke 1 26 and in the sixth month an the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou th hail thou that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this would be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her so here is here is Mary she doesn't know that in her lifetime that she is the good ground that God intended for this seed to fall in she has no knowledge of that she's just a regular person doing regular person things in her day amen going about her life but an angel God sends an angel messeng to her to tell her amen that now is the season now is the time and you're the bedding ground and she's confused about natural things as all of us would be how can this be and and immediately listen immediately she begins to look for ways that she can bring about the promise how can this be because I have not known a man so it's physically impossible for me to bring forth this prophecy and God was not looking for her to physically be able to bring forth the prophecy all he's looking for is somebody that will believe the word that this messenger gives her so that they can be the betting ground for this prophecy to bring forth of itself he's got the life of the word the Holy Ghost there to make sure that that word comes to pass inside of her amen she doesn't have to make it come to pass God has sent everything she needs he sent a messenger to tell her this is the appointed time you're the appointed person he's going to send the Holy Ghost to bring life to the very word that he promised to bring to life she doesn't have to manufacture anything she doesn't have to work up anything she doesn't have to try to do anything there's only one thing she has to do is surrender to the word that messenger told her and believe what God said it's so simple in the scriptures why does it become so hard in our lives as if somehow we're standing in a different spot than Mary is she says be it unto me according to Thy word God had sent a messenger to tell her the word of God to tell her the prophecy to to to to remind her of the prophecy and tell her you're the one you're the place you're the time that's now and she she had the audacity just to surrender and say be it unto me according to your word and we know that she conceived in the church age book under the section of pick up your pin and write when the angel tells brother BR pick up your pen and write it's the italicized uh section in the pergami and church age says the Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because I love this word because you want to hear what he says afterwards he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because nothing could stop it because he plowed through because no because she accepted his word to her when you look at things like this it becomes astounding the way listen this isn't the prophet saying this this is pick up your pin and write this is a message from the angel of the Lord to the to the bride and he's saying that everything that was prophesied he was going to do himself it was he came himself he he fulfilled himself the word he promised for that ever he did it all himself because she accepted his word to her as powerful as that prophecy was it had to have good ground or it wouldn't come forth right she was the predestinated good ground God foresaw her before the foundation of the world but there was something she had to do and that was surrender to the prophecy yield surrender her life and say be it unto me according to your word amen and he performed at that time all that was promised in the word because she accepted his word to her see she started with a mental battle she started with a struggle of how can this be how can I come on brother how long have we struggled with mental battles of how can this be and how can I amen H why me I'm nobody I'm from Nazareth no nothing good comes from Nazareth why me I'm already espoused to a man I come from no family I'm nothing special why me I can't even do what you're asking asking me to do I'm know no man I'm a virgin I have no ability to bring forth This Promise why me how me why and why for years and decades do we keep struggling with why me and how me and and I can't do it instead of just simply saying I don't know how I don't know why you chose me I don't know how it's going to happen but this one thing I know that something in me believes what that messenger just said what that angel just said and all I can say is be it unto me according to your word I can't bring it to pass I can't make it come to pass I can't be the bride that you've prophesied that I'll be in this end time I can't be that bride that that Prophet said was going to be standing here without spot without wrinkle shining in the glory of Christ very with the very display of Jesus Christ emanating from her flesh I cannot be that I cannot do that I don't have the power there's nothing in me that's capable of Performing that I can't do it but be it unto me according to the prophecy of that messenger if he said it's for me to do if he said it's for now to do then it's going to happen because God's going to send the power to bring the word to pass because the power is in the prophecy just looking for good ground friends let's turn to the Book of John John chapter 8 remember brother BR said man's a failure to begin with perfect can't do nothing right can't get anything right perfect but that's the place that he wants to manifest his word and if he chose to do it that way why am I constantly trying to talk him out of it that was his choice he chose to put himself on partnership with man he chose to bring the prophecy out of Fallen man he chose to fulfill the Plan of Redemption through mankind he chose to preach through the foolishness of preaching he chose all of these methods I didn't choose them he chose them amen why am I constantly trying to argue with him as if he doesn't know what he's doing instead of just accepting that he knows what he's doing he's got the power to bring it to pass and in John 8:37 Jesus he's he's in dialogue here with the the Pharisees and we're not going to get into all of it I just want to pull out one statement said I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you he started to identify yes naturally you're of the lineage of Abraham later he said you're not Abraham's seed spiritually this was only a natural acknowledgement but he's saying but you seek to kill me why because my word has no place in you because you're not the good ground there's no receiving set there's there's no receptor there's no place for my word to fall in you it's amazing when Jesus Christ was here his very presence his very presence brought brought every seed in the field to full Harvest maturity amen and and and I'm getting ahead of myself but just I want you to listen to me now when that bright light of the word made manifest in jesus' day when he was there that was the fullness of the word it was shining through a vessel it was shining through a man and it was so bright that not any seed whether it was wheat or tear could stay in immaturity but everything had to spring up and bear fruit of what was on the inside of it and it was that Shining Light that actually bound the tears and separated the wheat because the tears bound themselves together to persecute the light this is why Herod became friends with pilate and pilate and Herod were in conspiracy with the Jews amen all the tears just wrapped themselves together because under the bright light everything in the field came to full Harvest maturity right then amen and the same thing's happening in our day he says again in power of transformation he says now he had all this in mind and he said he said let there be now that's Genesis 1 said let there be this let there be that he was sewing seed let it be here Let It Be Here let it be here and he was and he knew it was going to be that way because it cannot change that's why when he says a virgin shall conceive he can't later come and say no it's a married woman who's already had two children because that seed can only bring forth of its kind can't change it it's already got life embedded in it it's already got certain genetic code inside so he says now it cannot change now that gives us Faith then and what he said here it's going to be so let's let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the beding grounds of that se into our hearts what do I have to do with this word believe it and receive it what do I have to do with this message believe it and receive it and that believing I can't do by myself amen I believe by faith it's by the grace of God it's a gift of God and not of myself the Fai to believe is a gift of God meaning that I've got something to believe with and that is the grace that's a gift of God but now I still have this free moral agency that I can receive what's being spoke I can accept it I can I can receive it and let it fall into the beding ground of my heart that I don't keep holding it out at arms length and analyzing it and talking about how it can't be mean it can't be right and that's not receiving it friends that's taking a gift and holding it out at arms length amen but he wants us to take that word and receive it and become one with it and say it's me be it unto me according to your word amen so let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the bedding grounds of that seed into our hearts and let us act out this place that he has placed Us in in the last days let the seed fall in our hearts Lord let the word fall into my heart let there not be any unbelief like Abraham when he was an old man looked like impossible how are they going to do that how is he going to be this way he never considered that he just received the word of God and went on believing it and God brought it to pass what did Abraham do to have the promised son what did he do I mean he wasn't taking Vitality vitamins to preserve his Youth and posterity right he wasn't doing exercise to try to stay there was nothing Abraham himself could do to bring the promise to pass but God had already prophesied and when the prophecy went forth it can't return to God void but it has to accomplish the purpose that he sent it for so the only thing Abraham could do was keep believing through every Junction in life through every failure of his own all Abraham could do was keep believing listen Abraham wasn't let's just think it this way it wasn't a smooth sail it wasn't an easy ride amen there were some bumps along the way there was some poor choices there were some mistakes there were some missteps all along the way amen but it didn't change the fact that he still believed what God said he received the word and believed the word when he tried to act it out maybe he got it wrong maybe he misinterpreted or allowed somebody to misinterpret it but it didn't change the fact that he believed it and because he believed it righteousness was imputed unto him not because he did but because he believed and he did a lot of things that weren't right and a lot of things that were odd sure but he kept believing and that that Faith he brother B said he or the Bible says he staggered not at the promise of God that's right he just kept believing make a mistake keep believing make a misstep keep believing produce an ishmail keep believing go to Egypt keep believing get in conflict with lot keep believing separate from lot keep believing amen your wife gets upset keep believing she's sterile keep believing you become sterile keep believing just keep believing amen God needed beding ground he needed a place where his word to fall into and abide in that until it could come of itself and produce itself again amen again in the paman church age from the church age book he said the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today day is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live so it's receiving the word the truth but not the truth just any truth the truth for the day in which you live now listen carefully Jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow am amen that is the Bible amen you mean you mean that the message in Christ and the word it it was never here to emphasize the works but it was here to bring back the word amen yes this message was not to emphasize works it was to restore the word because God knows that when the people get the word The Works will follow amen that's God's plan why because the life is in the word to what reproduce itself all it needs is good ground what is good ground a predestinated heart that will receive it and believe it that's all he needs friends he just needs us to receive it as he said it and say that's it and just believe it and just let God let the seed do the work inside of us let the process come to full fruit amen and not derail it and not come somehow handicap it all the time but just let the seed do the work he sent it to do because it will not return unto him void but it will accomplish that which he sent it to do and he sent a word in this generation through a prophetic message amen and that word is doing a work in our lives and it will accomplish what he said it will do and he will have a bride without spot a wrinkle he will have a many membered bride standing here reflecting his glory upon this Earth in the end times she will be so much like him she will be amen and don't you dare ask me how I'm going to do it cuz I'm not going to do it because I can't do it any more than the Virgin could produce a child I can't do it any more than Abraham could produce a promised son through Sarah I can't do it any more than anybody else in the Bible could do it all I can do is say yay and amen that's nothing but the truth brother brandom and then the word will produce itself cuz the word is God it cannot fail he knows that the works will follow look at Abraham's life God speaks to him he believes he acts amen but he doesn't act completely right because he's supposed to go uh separate from all his Kindred and his family in his home and go to but he he takes dad along and he takes lot along and we know that that there's this belief he has but the but the the let's just say the performance of that which he believes are been told isn't perfect oh my good goodness I'm so thankful God wrote a Bible and told us the truth and so that's in our lives it hasn't always looked good we believe this message but when it come to performing it we haven't always we don't have a stellar track record friends it doesn't look clean and tidy and nice and neat it's a little bit messy but it doesn't change the fact that in us we believe that prophecy is true and somehow I believe I'm part of it and so if you follow Abraham's life his life is not always perfect performance his life is not always keeping exactly to the letter what the Lord said he's got some misinterpretations and some disobedient and he left the promised land when he shouldn't leave the promised land there's a little bit of lying and there's all kinds of different things involved but he received the word and God knows that if you get the word The Works will follow and through all of the bumps and bruises and ups and downs Abraham kept learning one lesson this is just brother Chad this is my own interpretation the one lesson that I think Abraham kept learning is just do what God says just do what God says just do it it's it was so much better just to do what God says amen and by the time he gets to the end of his life When God says take thine son thine only son Hey listen now this man's faith has come to Perfection now his character has been developed by walking with the Lord he knows if he gets the word The Works will follow and at the end of his life there's no questions they're just taking his son going to the mountain to slame and God was so pleased he said Abraham stay thy hand now that I I know that thou lovest me yeah see that wasn't Abraham's performance day one but day one he received the word amen forget the word The Works will follow in the message you must be born again brother benam says the the true word comes to the true Prophet I believe that true word comes to the true prophet he tells you the true word I believe that you follow the true word and you get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's sons and the word of God is revolving right out of God into you because you are of his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God why will I do the works of God because a true Prophet brought the true word and I follow the true word and I get a true experience of the word amen and now something's spinning off of God and dropping into my heart which is the spirit of God and I'm going to do the works of God not because I'm special and not because I'm able but because I got a true word from a true prophet amen and I follow the true word and I got a true experience of the word amen and that started bringing the word to life inside of me as it I love this and the word of God is revolving right out of God into you because you are of his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God thankful so let's turn to Matthew 13 together so now we know the word of God is a seed God Saves by the fluences of preaching he saved and he sent his word to heal and to deliver from destruction God's word is a seed and has the power to replicate itself when it falls in good ground but now I want to once again review the fact that we are also a seed or we have a seed within Matthew 13:24 another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and S tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir do thou soow good seed in thy field from when thou have it tears he said unto them as the enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wil thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather you together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into the barn he goes down to give the interpretation of this in verse 37 and he said he answered and he said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels so when he brings the interpretation he tells us that he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man that's he himself the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom so in the previous Parable there was good ground the seed had to fall in and we've learned that the good ground is that which has been prepared predestinated ground that's the believer and only in the good ground will that seed bring forth of itself again but now the field is the world and the sewer is the son of man and the seed that he sown is the children of the Kingdom an enemy SED other seed this is going all the way back to the Garden of Eden an enemy sowed other seed and these were children of the wicked one amen but now we find out that the children of the Kingdom have been swn into the World by the son of man and when they were swn into the world it means as it went as a seed it's the same as in the Book of Genesis when the seeds were laying neath the water they already had a life inside of them God was what was God going to do God was going to change the conditioned by the spoken word to bring that seed to life and now God has once again swn seed into the world Amen and those seeds are the children of the kingdom and he's the husbandman who SED him himself so what do you think are in those seeds Amen in Genesis 1:1 we don't turn there but I'll just remind you of it he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light so we find already that the holy spirit is here brooding and I want to bring to your attention amen that the holy spirit is already present and the holy spirit is already brooding but the holy spirit is not changing anything till the word Goes Forth but when the word Goes Forth it's the spirit of God bringing the word to pass so it's not amen it's it's a conjunction amen gone the holy spirit is the spirit of the word to bring the word to to life the holy spirit's already there but it needs God's spoken word and when God speaks it word it goes into action as the agent to bring that word to pass and begins to move things into place and position around the world but the Holy Ghost wasn't just because it was there it was already there doesn't mean it can start repositioning things it has to position it according to the word and the word has to be spoken in due season amen the the the the point in all of this friends is that we can say we want the spirit we want the spirit we want the spirit and that's what we need we need the spirit to make the word live amen but the spirit of God can be present but the spirit of God is here to make the word live we still need the spoken word amen we needed a prophet to come in this age and bring the word and another thing that f i find absolutely amazing in what brother Ma's getting ready to tell us I'm going to read several quotes but what I find amazing is that Holy Ghost was bound in this generation bound the very spirit of God the very Holy Ghost was bound it was bound by these denominational Rivers for nearly 2,000 years but is going to be loosed in the evening time why by the evening time message and where's the Holy Ghost going to go back in the people of again what bound the Holy Ghost the limitation of the word bound the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost and the word are linked together they work together amen they're part of the same thing they're part of the same person they're expressions of the same being which is God almighty so we can say I just want the spirit I just want the spirit I want the spirit God is sending the spirit but God is sending the word and those two go together amen that's why all the Holy Ghost moves in the Pentecostal movement that I grew up in it amounted to enthusiasm and excitement but where was the word where were lives changed yeah where was a bride made manifest God had to send his word amen amen in the message it is the rising of the sun he said fear not for I am he that was dead and is alive again forever more and I have the keys to death and hell I've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every for ordained predestinated seat of God shall come to life when the light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to do he had he had raised from the dead so now he's saying that this this he he's typing this also with Genesis now there was seeds that were laying there they were under the water there was no light there but there was already light brother Ben said they were germinated seeds they already life in them but they were waiting for a condition something had to Spring them in the manifestation Quicken them to life amen they're laying there dormant they're waiting and now God would begin to speak and as he would speak the Holy Ghost and that would move amen and move that word into position and he said let there be light there was light then the firmament would move away and the waters would roll away and dry land would appear and as everything started coming into position according to the harmony of God's word all of a sudden he said now let the seed bring forth of its kind and all of a sudden that seed that was laying there that was a palm seed had Palm life in it was germinated long ago all of a sudden when the condition was right by the spoken word of God moved upon by the spirit of God all of a sudden a palm tree emerged cuz it was already there it was all already there it needed the word of God to recondition the atmosphere it needed the spirit of God to bring the right atmosphere according to the word of God and then what is it comes up a palm tree why is it a palm tree that comes up because it was a palm life that was embedded in it amen amen he says the predestined seat of God shall come to life when the light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to there's a crop laying there but it needs the light but it needs the light of its age and God sent a light in this day what is this light to do is to bring the life of the seed out God's power to transforming said God through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that's the spirit for it's the lifegiver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is doesn't change what it is it produces what it is so when the life in the word means the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is so again in in same message and now what is the transformation how do we get it what does the transformation God does it by the spirit of his word he transform he plants his seed throws his Spirit on it and it brings forth the product his holy spirit transforms the seed word in to be Vindication of its kind what kind of seed you are that shows just what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside this is what happened when Jesus Christ was standing there as that bright shining light whatever seeds were inside was starting to show on the outside doesn't matter if you're wearing broad Flores and you're wearing a robe and you have a priest garment on what you were inside was starting to show when this light was shining when the fullness of the word was present it was bringing out what was in the seed you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside you just can't keep from it you can't make the tree anything but what it is it's going to be that way the Holy Spirit transforms the seeds that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform it amen it'll bring it from dormant laying there lifeless shrouded in darkness it'll bring it into a full manifestation because the life is already there in the fourth seal the prophet makes this statement the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form I think it's amazing and I'm just going to share this with you I don't have a solution to all of these statements so don't look at me to explain everything tidy I can't but sometimes brother B said the seed's laying there and it takes the spirit to bring it life but then he said the the the the spirit is the word he says it this way the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form so where do you get the spirit from the word or from somewhere else to make the word live I think we start over complicating things I think we start making it difficult CU he told us in the scriptures that there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the spirit and these three are one amen the true word carries with it the true spirit amen they come together amen there's a spirit of God that will make the word of God live amen I can't tell you whether amen you have to get the word first and then the spirit comes upon the word and makes it live or you get the word when it's preached in the spirit of the word and the spirit of the word I can't tell you how the mechanics of it all I'm just going to tell you that you can't separate these things too far from one another that if you want the spirit you need the word amen if you want the spirit life inside of you you need to get the word if you want the word to live you need the spirit of the word to make it live so don't ask me how to mechanically break that down I can't break it down for you cuz brother Brom says it both ways and I can't make it neat and tidy but what I can tell you is this word that been given to us in this day has transforming power life inside of it life to bring the life in you to fruition life to bring the word that's preached to manifestation so is it the word that comes to me or the word that's in me it's both friends it's the word that's in you that was planted before the foundation world it's also the word that's coming to you to manifest itself in you so where does the manifested life come from does it come from the nature of God trapped inside the SE Gene of God or does it come from the word that's being preached to me as it manifests itself I'm just going to say both you need both you must have both you have to have a seed and good ground amen I know this it doesn't matter how much seed's inside of you amen you can ask for Holy Ghost to be poured on you all the time but without the preaching of the word there's not going to be a manifestation of the life of the word it takes both amen it takes the word and the spirit it takes the life inside of you and the Life coming to you right amen so let's not over complicate it let's just say God fill me with your word but no I want to be filled with the spirit okay fill me with your spirit how's he going to fill you with the spirit probably going to send you his word I I don't want to complicate this I just want to say this word that you've given me will do what you sent it to do amen whatever you planted inside of me before the foundation of the world by predestination it's going to do what you ordained it to do this word whether in me or coming to me is not going to return to you void but it'll accomplish what you sent it out to do I think sometimes in the past I I felt that I had to take one side or the other to explain it tidy one way or the other and in so doing we leave out truths I don't know how to explain it it's spiritual and my mind is just stuck in carnality but by the grace of God my soul is free to say Amen brother Brenham says the only thing that can make the word live is the spirit amen then he says the word itself is spirit amen so what makes what live I don't know it's just amen the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts praise God he didn't say you go to work and act the spirit goes to work and acts if you get the word The Works will follow we if we find ourselves living a mediocre life and we live below our privileges we're not happy with the way we're living well we don't really need is uh a a beat myself up session I mean if you're wrong just admit you're wrong like that's that's that should be step number one and we don't make excuses we just say you know what I'm doing a really lousy job of being a Believer right now no excuses but also not a self-pity party and say maybe I'm not one of them I'll never be them I'm never going they're all passing me out just stop that just stop it now cuz what we're doing is defeating ourselves we're never getting off the ground because we're tearing ourselves down we don't even need the devil to do it what we need to do is just be honest with ourselves but if I want to do the works I need to get the word I need to put my focus not on myself but I need to put a focus on this word that God sent and I need to say Lord let that be unto me too you said you'll take care of temper let that be unto me you say stop it let that be unto me Lord you say we're going to have your very manifestation let that be unto me too Lord I need it in my life amen listen no matter how much you hear it you're never going to attain to it of your own effort just just hearing it as a instruction in the ways of righteousness as though it's an intellectual speech and the way to be a a bride member so lesson one let's talk about the way you dress this has got to be long and that has to be covered and this has to be loose fitting and all of that's true but if you look at it as a way to attain to The Works you're going to be so disappointed instead of looking at it and say that's the truth yeah that's the way a daughter of God should dress that I believe it Lord be it unto me according to what the prophet taught and when the spirit of that word comes to life inside of you guess what you're going to want to do amen yes right doesn't mean we don't preach about these things brother B If You Don't Preach If You Don't Preach clothesline you're not preaching the gospel because we got to hear the truth so that we can recognize we're wrong so that the truth can set us free from misconceptions from wrong ideas from our own selfishness and our own Pride we need to hear the word we need to hear it straight we need to hear it true but we don't need to hear it as a as a measuring stick that somehow I must attain to to be Bri right we just need to hear it as the reality this is not what's pleasing to God I need that to be alive inside of me and let the word take root and good ground it says it's true God it's true now make it live inside of me another statement brother man comes to Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said the word only has life any other word is a hybrid no no matter how much it looks like it it isn't the word the word produces its own life praise be to God so if I receive the word the word will produce its own life I don't have to manufacture anything all I have to do is receive Abraham manufactured nothing Eve or uh uh Mary manufactured nothing what did they do they receive the word and it produced itself and the message it is rising of the sun he says this real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why he's an eagle a eagle to a eagle remember brother benham's story this is what he's referring to the chick the the eagle in the chicken yard the farmer took the egg and we all know it so well set it under a hen and it hatched out and it tried to live like the chickens but it was different in nature than the chickens and one day his his mama comes flying over and screams and when he hears the scream something inside of him resonates with that scream and and he knows whatever that is I am down on the inside and brother bram's trying to he's trying to show us amen how a God is calling out of the denominations his children this is what the analogy is this is what the parable is trying to tell us but he he's telling us that the reason the eagle could respond to the eagle scream is because it was already an eagle he wasn't trying to become an eagle he was an eagle so he wasn't trying to change from chicken to Eagle in his mind he was a chicken but in nature he was an eagle he was trying to overcome his mindset right not his genetics amen so because his mind was chicken when Mama Said fly he said I can't right how I don't know how and she says you're already an eagle just jump and flap your wings you already know how on the inside the life is there flying is already in you you just have a chicken mind cuz you you come to the world alienated your mind is darkened to the things of God you have spiritual Amnesia but you were a Son of God before the foundation of the world you're still a Son of God you'll always be a Son of God but the eagle scream come to wake you up out of the stuper thinking that you're just a chicken you're not a chicken look around look at what you hunger for for look at what you like look at what you don't like look at how you don't fit in you're not a chicken you're an [Applause] eagle and he realized listen Mama didn't have to come down and do demonstrations on flying all Mama had to do is encourage him to get out of chicken mentality cuz it was already in him this is the story brother Bam's telling it was an eagle to an eagle the chicken ran and hid but it was because he's an eagle he's responding to the eagle scream why is it you and I respond to this message because there's message already down on the inside friends it's a call to the children of God there's a child of God already down on the inside that's why we respond the problem our struggle is we've been raised in a chicken yard grounded for so long thinking that we're chickens we're not chickens we're sons of God yeah and the word of God is here to awaken the reality on the inside of us Amen to bring another truth another reality so that we can say you know when when that little Eagle began to flap its wings and jump and got up on the up on the post of the fence you know what he did he accepted what his mama had said he just said be unto me according to what mama said and started flapping his wings he hadn't done it before he didn't go to school for it he didn't have intellectual teaching on it it was already in him and it was already in you and I to believe this message from the first time we heard it we were just stuck in chicken thinking that's why when everybody else ran away we were like uh I should run with them but I kind of like what that sounds like like everything in my experience is telling me to follow the chicken but something else down inside is saying look up I mean let's it won't hurt the look when others wouldn't touch the books because they're poison amen something in you there was a curiosity that said well it won't hurt me to read just one it won't hurt to listen to this tape it won't hurt what was that friends it was an eagle to an eagle it was not an eagle to a chicken telling you to become an eagle it was an eagle to an eagle here he is in Rising in the sun he said it's an eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation of the world the word to the word pay close attention the word predestinated that's you and I to the word written for the hour that's the message of the hour what was calling the word written for the hour was calling to the word predestinated what was it Eagle to Eagle or brother B says word to word word to word yeah so where's the word where's the word yeah it's on both sides it's the word being preached but it's also the word on the inside and the Soul it's the part that's believing the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour praise God let's turn to John 4 quickly John chapter 4 we know this story is the woman at the well the Samaritan woman that Jesus had needs to go by Samaria because why CU she was predestinated to life it's amazing that she was predestinated to life but yet she had to hear the message because it takes the word to bring the seed to life amen and so he had to go by to wake her up in John chapter 4 he begins a dialogue with her and talk to her and reveal her husbands and all of this but I'm going to pick it up in verse 19 and the woman saith un him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me now I want to stop at verse 19 for a minute because this woman has a bad reputation five husbands she's living with the six she can't come to the well at the respectable time of day when the respectable women come her life is shrouded in darkness but what's in her heart when she comes in contact with somebody that can tell her her life and tell her that there's water of living uh everlasting life tell her that she's had five husbands the one she's in with now what does she want to know she wants to know how can I worship God what's the right way I'm confused with all this religion right the Jews say this the Baptist say this the Methodist say this the Catholic I'm confused about all of this but something inside of me though in a harlot condition though coming to the the wrong time of day there's something in me that wants to know how does God want to be worshiped and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what you know we know what we worship for the Salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh when which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he we know that the woman then leaves her water pot and goes runs into the City and begins to tell them she knows the truth she knows where to worship she knows how to worship and Jesus was given giving a dispensational change he was telling her now's coming the time that you're not going to worship in a building you're not going to worship through a denomination you're not going to worship through a Creed you're not going to worship in Jerusalem and you're not going to worship here in Samaria but you're going to worship in spirit and in truth and something in her liked it something in her resonated that that was true and the woman ran into the City and brother benam says I don't have the quote but I was just reading it today brother brandom said when she comes running into the City and begins to tell them they knew her before now they know she was changed she had been transformed what transformed her what was the what was it was it a week away was it a self-help book what what was it counseling it was it was immediately when she came in contact with the truth something inside her sprung to life and she was changed because she was no longer believing she was a chicken she was recognizing who she really was and it changed her yeah just hearing the truth changed her in testimony in the sea the prophet says notice the woman she wasn't dead she she caught it quickly she was a seed predestinated to eternal life and as soon as that flashed over her quickly she caught it yes she knew she says sir we know when the Messiah cometh he will tell us these things who art thou why was she attracted to the word why wasn't she believed the word what was going on Amen listen it wasn't Jesus's ability to clearly explain anything cuz he didn't clearly explain nothing she asked questions he didn't explain it but she came in contact with the living word for her day and when that living word for her day the person of the word the life of the word the word itself the prophecy fulfilled when she came in contact with that it quickened something inside of her because she she was a seed a predestinate to eternal life in another message brother R said look at that little woman she had fallen from God's thought yes she had fallen from God's thought what does that make her part of God Amen falling from God's thought what is a word a thought expressed she was part of the word predestinated to be part of the word she had fallen from God's thought she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven that's why he came to her that's why he spoke the word to her that's why she responded to the word and that's why she was changed by the power of the word for her day it awakened the seed inside of her see it wasn't just the word spoken because Jesus was speaking truth all over the place are it was that when the truth was spoken there was something there that could be quickened by the truth TR that was spoken the word to the word and the message The God Who is rich in Mercy says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or little girl you would walk around there would be a certain things that would just when it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that and certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then what was that little form of life it was the word it was God it was eternal life is that what the message tells us it was in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you came from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you where is the word oh is it in the message yes is it in you yes the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it why did you see the word because you were part of the word you were a thought that had fallen from the mind of God part of God predestinated to be part of the Manifest word for your day so the word was in you with life inside of it the seed was a germinated seed it was there with eternal life already embedded in it but it needed to come in contact with another part of itself now do you understand the whole idea between the Chinese Laundry ticket it takes two parts of the same thing Eagle to Eagle word to word Spirit to Spirit life to life and when those two come back together that's Redemption we're coming back home amen Hall [Music] Amen brother B said in things that are to be here in he's in the last few days of his life here on Earth here in uh December of 1965 and he begins to keep breaking these principles down as we get to the end of his ministry in 65 he starts to really hone in on this seed Gene and what really is and what a Believer really genuinely is and and listen he exposes it and he Nails it and this is right at the end of his ministry and he's trying to bring us to understand that we are part of God we were predestined before the foundation of the world Amen and and and can no more be lost than God can be lost that God's redeeming us and calling us back home and he says you say I got the baptism of the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God brother B starting to say something he's going to say something here two days later and I'm going to read it to you about the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's trying to move the Pentecostal idea away from this this sensationalism and this emotionalism and this something and he's trying to show us what the real gift actually is what makes us Sons and Daughters of God Amen is not some outward manifestation but what makes us Sons and Daughters of God is a seed Gene of God on the inside and that's the only thing that makes us Sons and Daughters of God Amen in the message leadership December 7th things that are to be we just read was December 5th leadership the choice of your conduct you you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expresses shows exactly what's on the inside the CER where many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell see there's something more important than manifestations there's something more important than experiences there's something more important sensation and it's not that those are not important but if you have all of that and don't have a c Gene of God you're not going anywhere no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right look here you are an outside person you have five senses that contact the outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home see taste feel smell and hear then you have a spirit on the inside of that and has five Outlets conscience and love and so forth five outlets and you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts to physical your spiritual contacts to spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God Hey listen we what we need is we need that se Gene to come to life what wakes it up the eagle scream man what what calls it to come forth the message of the hour what changed the woman at the well she had a seed she needed to come in contact with the word for her day the word for her day woke her up to the fact that she was a child of God what do we need we need the word because the word itself is spirit Spirit in word form do you need the spirit absolutely it's the holy spirit that makes the word live I need the spirit but I need the word which do I need more let's just say both that's how God gives us life is by his word his word itself has life in it he brings his life to bring to life his word he brings his word to bring his life I don't know how to separate that all I know how to do is receive it man brother Brenham is in an argument I just want to close with this thought brother Brenham is not in an argument but a discussion with a Catholic priest and when brother R says this I I I hear him say this all the time and it really made me sit and Ponder because the Catholic priest was saying God is in his church and brother benam says God's not in his church God is in his word but then at the end of the ministry brother Brenham saying God is in the bride which is his church so I'm are thinking well is God in his church or is he not in his church like he's telling the Catholic Church priest I disagree with you God's not in his church God's in his word but it seems like he's telling us God is in his church has anybody else ever had that question not just me I begin to look at this and what brother Brenham he Nails it down because you always have to understand take what brother Brenham says in context of who the audience he's speaking to he's speaking to a Catholic priest and a Catholic priest is all the Catholic church has already uh uh uh uh dismissed the Bible and the word of God as an absolute they become an absolute themselves and the pope and the church can change the word anytime they want because they believe that they're the mouthpiece of God the voice of God the representative the Vicor of Christ they can stand on Earth and speak for God and they can add to and take away and they believe that God is in his church and because God is in the church now the church can make the word whatever they want the word to be that's what brother brenham's resisting that's the idea that's the concept that's what he's saying when he said God's not in his church he's in his word amen amen because God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and God brother B said God is the word amen and Jesus Christ is the word made manifest amen the anointed word amen and and the and the word is the spirit and word form so we come back to God is in this word and here's the statement that he makes in the God of this evil age as as he's as he's disagreeing with the priest said I said God is in his word and if the I said God is in the word and if the church is contrary to the word then don't believe the church but then he comes in the church age book in the paman church age when the same section pick up your pen and write that Angel Lord told him to pick up a pen his right he says I'm just going to read just a little excerpt of it he says he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it again here's the secret of this the word is in the bride so brother brandom says that God is not in the church God's in the word but the angel of the Lord said the word word is in the bride so if the word is in the bride God is in his bride amen God is in the church if the word is in the church if the word is not in the church God is not in the church because God is with his word and God is in his word now when he was talking about the uh the woman at the well and he was talking about you and I and he was talking about the eagle he said the word come to word amen there's word trapped down inside the children of God the seed genes of God attributes of his thought there's word laying there and he sends the word to wake up the word he sends the word to Quicken the word he sends the word to connect with the word to bring the word to life so where is the word the word is in the SE genene it's already there when God is in this the bride amen when God is in the word and the word is in the bride then God is in the bride and see we can never take a Catholic attitude to that and say God is in his bride now anything we believe is truth and anything we say is right as soon as we start tampering with the word of God like that we're doing exactly what the Catholic church has done amen we are yielded to the word we're not leading the word the word is leading us and when the word is in the bride God is in his bride and she is becoming the word remember said the bride becomes the word the church becomes the word by letting the word flow through it by what surrendering to the word how did Mary become the word remember when Mary was there heavy with child she was the word amen why was she the word because the word was living in her she was the very manifestation of what Isaiah spoke she became the manifested word how will we become the word when this word that's been preached this word that's been given from from a from a messenger to his bride when that little virgin bride can say be it unto me according to your word and that word comes in and takes root and takes life and begins to take over she will become the manifested word for her day by receiving the word and when she receives the word she receives the life of the word and the life of the word goes to work to bring the word in her to pass amen I'm so thankful God God sent his word and I'm so thankful God sent his spirit amen and I don't know how to separate those two but nothing in me wants to separate those two God is in his bride because the word is in the bride amen which word was it the word that was preached or the C genene of God before the foundation of the world I'd like to say both all that was preached takes resident in her and comes to life in her good ground amen all that God foresaw in a bride and predestinated and laid inside her as a SE genene will all come to life and manifest itself under the anointing of the word so where does it come from the word what brings it to life the life of the word which is the spirit how does it work I can't figure that out but one thing I know this word is changing me it's bringing things out of me that were deep inside it's cutting away things on the outside of me that always trip me up what's doing it it's the foolishness of preaching that's saving me it's the preaching of this message it's going back again and listening to it again going back to the tape again listening to cge is this the time again going back to the rising of the sun again again choosing of a bride again coming Wednesday hearing preaching coming Sunday what's it doing it's bringing the life of the word to life inside of me why because the word's in me so the word comes to me what does it do it reproduces the word through me what do I have to do I don't know what to do except say God you can have me amen I want to be your betting ground I want to be the place that this word falls into takes root and comes to life and I believe that I'm part of that good ground not because I'm good but because somebody foreordained there would be a ground for this seed to fall in and I just believe that I'm part of that good ground because the husbandman saw to it that when the seed went forth in this day there would be a place for it the land that it could grow and predestinated me and put a seed in me to connect with that seed so the two could come together to produce the life of the seed so what seed has come to us Christ the anointed word what seed is it that's in us coming to life Christ the anointed word word is coming to word ego to Ego life to life and what's it doing reproducing Christ in the formation of the Bride I'm so glad I'm so glad that I can identify with the woman at the well I'm so glad I can identify with the Virgin Mary I'm so glad I can identify with Abraham or even Gideon none of these people could do it on their own none of these people had what it takes but every one of them had What It Takes not a one of them had what it takes but every one of them had What It Takes I can tell you this I don't have what it takes to be a mature adopted son of God in this day but I'll tell you this I've got what it takes a seed Gene of God that God is nurturing and building through the brooding of his Spirit he's bringing the life out of it and I know he's doing it by this me message and I thank God for it amen let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come I want to read one scripture to you as we close out of 1 Thessalonians 213 and I'll just read it to you 1 Thessalonians 2:13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you received the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as is a truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe he said I thank God that when you receive the word that we preach this is Paul we said you didn't receive it as it was the word of men but as in truth it was the word of God and then he says which effectually worketh also in you that believe what's working the word that you believe came from God under the preaching of Paul it's doing the work in youen it's changing you it's molding you it's bringing out virtues out of you what's doing it it's the word that we recognize not to be the word of Paul or the word of William Brandon or even the man in the pull pit we recognize it to be the word of God and it's that that we receive as the word of God that is working effectually in us who believe praise me to God I thankful that God gave me something to believe with yes and that was not my brain that was a SE Gene of God in my soul and it's deeper than anything else about me it's the original part I'm thank God he's bringing us back to the original part and let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus I'm thankful for your word here we are Lord on a Wednesday night because we need to be reminded of these things God we go out life and we get distracted and knocked down and make mistakes and do everything that your children in the Bible have done but God we have to come back and hear an eagle scream again so that we'll once again try to flap our wings once more and see if we can make it to that post maybe beyond the post to the rooftop maybe from the rooftop to the treetop one thing I know Lord that we're Eagles to begin with and we're going to fly we're going to fly out of here one day because we're Eagles to begin with though we were Eagles from before the foundation of the world we were Eagles before we landed in the chicken yard we were Eagles before our mind was dark and we were always Eagles you never left it to ourselves to figure out that we were Eagles but you sent a word that could identify us you sent an eagle scream to wake us up to who we really are and God the fact that we could hear the eagle scream is a testimony of who we are it's the word coming to the word it's a witness Lord that we are whatever is screaming out we have a scream within God all the potential of the word is inside of us Lord let your word come and water it Lord cultivate it Lord shine your upon it do whatever we need to bring the life of that word out sew more seed into our good ground Lord by the preaching of the word and change us heal us restore us bring us to a healthy condition Lord as Sons and Daughters of God We Trust in your word we don't trust in ourselves but we trust in your word we don't trust our minds but we trust this message Lord for it is thus sayith the Lord you have sent a word and that word will not return to you void but it's not just the word that was preached that won't return to your Void it's the word that you swed into our souls that won't return to your Void and that word will also accomplish what you determined for it to accomplish God Have Your Way in me we stand here Lord as helpless as Mary was we stand as helpless as Abraham and as helpless as Gideon but oh God you've already placed it inside of us and you're bringing it to us now for us to hear God help us to receive not to argue but to receive not to question but to receive Not To Doubt but to believe and let that word fall into the betting ground of My Heart Lord and move all unbelief away and help me to receive it and Lord may you bring fruit from this word we love you we trust you we trust your ways and we thank you for being alive in this generation we thank you for being here tonight to hear these words Lord for they more than life to us God may we run into the city tomorrow and declare but we've heard the truth may everybody see us know that we're changed Lord by the truth that you revealed to us it's changed us and molded us to your image we love you we're trusting in you to finish the work that you began in us we're trusting in the life and the seed to bring fruit back to you again we love you Lord we ask you bless your people as as we separate and go to our homes may you just walk with us and walk in us and use us Lord For Your Glory and for your purpose in Jesus Christ's name we pray Amen brother Ben it un to me according to your word according to your your prises I can stand secure carve upon th heart the truth
