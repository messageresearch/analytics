TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh jesus oh lamb of god worth is your name praise be to god amen it's good to see you on this cold wintry snowy evening we praise god for being here safely and trust that will keep you all safe on the roads tonight and while we're standing let's just turn to john chapter 5. we're going to continue on in the series we're on and search the scriptures amen it's been hard to get away from so we're not going to fight it anymore we're just going to stick here amen and see what god will do well we're standing let's look at john chapter 5 verse 39 it says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for the reading of the word but lord anybody with literacy can read words lord we need more than that we need more than what our minds can give us lord more than what an education can provide we need you to come down lord and give us a personal revelation of this by yourself lord that you would reveal to us yourself that we might see you for who you are in this hour at this time for god we love you lord and we love what you're doing and what you're revealing and we just give ourselves to you that you might have total and complete preeminence amongst your bride we ask that you take control of the service take these lips lord under your control to speak your words of eternal life in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated we're gonna i'm gonna read a couple quotes here and then we're gonna jump back over to matthew chapter one it's amazing the more we look the more we find in the first few verses of the new testament so there's so much laying there and we just want to explore that you know i used to used to be when i would read the bible and then probably the least interesting part of the bible was the genealogies you'd get to the genealogies and it's like blah blah blah you don't even try to pronounce all the names it's just like you know z name a name m name in name and you're just skipping through it until you can get to the other stuff but now all of a sudden it's amazing the revelations that are laying in the genealogies because god wanted to place it in the bible and if he wanted to place it in the bible there's some benefit to it there's some reason that it's laying there and i say thank god and give us eyes to see more there's there's the more that god is revealing himself the more he's showing us he's taking scriptures that we've read but not understood places where he's been hiding but we've never seen him and he begins to unfold and we see him in plain sight in places where he was hidden before now we see clearly and if he's doing that what about the rest of the bible i mean there's a this is a big book and he's hiding all over here amen the threefold purpose his plan that he had before the foundation of the world it's been unfolding itself through this entire scripture so he's hiding all over the place he's just waiting for the bride to come and dig out the nuggets and find where he is amen brother brahm says in christ is the mystery of god revealed so notice now down through the ages he has been gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the types now he can just go on to that and express himself so gradually slowly he's been letting the mystery out through the prophets and through the types the further down in the same message is all those things typed him just in type but yet the mystery was hid so he's been in the types he's been in the prophets amen he's been in all this he's been in the genealogies amen but he's been hid in there the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses so now we know he's been expressing it in time but never revealing the mystery never revealing the secret amen but holding it back to the last days for the great revelation because the great revelation is the theme of the entire bible the great revelation is christ the mystery of god revealed amen so to get the mystery of god revealed you have to see christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed so he's been holding it back for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david and joseph and elijah and on down through we we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expresses jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving is secret in full so he can go back and he can show hey it expresses christ perfectly amen and in this aspect it's perfect and in this aspect and it's showing this angle of christ in this thing on christ but yet and though it shows it so perfectly in time yet it never gives us secret and full waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it hallelujah now it's been waiting and waiting for this great revelation waiting for it to be known waiting for the last days waiting for that to be known but not known to the whole world amen only known to the seed only known to the christ seed only known to the elect only known to the bride amen so the mystery has been held back but it's been declared it's been shown but it's been shown in types and in shadows and in the prophets and then in the genealogies and in everything else it's been shown but never the secret given in full holding back waiting till the last days for it to be revealed but it's not revealed to everybody it's only revealed to a certain small percentage of the people that are on earth and they are the elect predestinated bride of jesus christ he's only giving the love secrets to his wife and that's why you know sometimes the message becomes so complicated amen for for individuals because the message is not supposed to be intellectually learned and this is a this is a point that if we could just catch this and hold on to it it would help us so much amen it's not that we can come down and then i can teach you the message and as i teach it to you you can learn it like you learned algebra or like you learn trigonometry or any kind of difficult science physics you know physics is hard it's hard to grasp it's difficult to catch but with a good teacher and enough time we can work you up to where you can accomplish calculations in physics the message is not that way it doesn't matter how good a teacher we have and how much time we have and how slow we go amen and how often we explain it it's only to be known by revelation in fact brother brennan preaches when he comes to the third pool of his ministry he preaches it in such a strange way amen because he comes to the seventh seal and he's moving down through the seventh seal and as he gets down there he starts he stops and he starts looking back and starts pointing to visions he says remember the tent vision amen remember the vision of the baby shoe and me trying to string the thread so you can't teach spiritual things to the pentecostal babies remember the fishing line the first pool the second pool and he he's preaching the seventh seal and he's taking you right back to the visions amen and showing first pull i explained too much second pull i explained too much but when it come to the third pool he said now don't explain this so he's preaching the seven seals and he goes through that he starts showing this and showing that and he says now the sword in the hand he said this is this is your third pull and he and he says the remember the constellation of angels and sunset mountain and he's talking about all this and he says now i said i feel to stop right here stop you know i remember the first few times i read that i'm getting so excited and like like he's showing us the vision he's showing a sunset mount he's talking about the king's sword all right now he's going to come and tie all of this together and my heart i remember reading the seal book one time and i'm really digesting it and i'm going all the way through and i'm sitting there and i'm getting excited i'm anticipating the punchline's coming the punchline is coming he's going to tie it all together explain it and tell me what all of these visions all of these symbols and all these happenings meant and it gets to that point he says now i feel to stop right there i said no don't stop right there but see he said don't explain this this is not to be explained that's why brother branham would go and say now i hope you're reading between the lines now i haven't said it all but i've said just enough that if you're spiritual you'll catch what i'm talking about amen he doesn't have one message that you can come to one message where brother branham is now going to lay out the third pull the seventh seal and make it simple for everybody to understand so you go take this one message and you read through and by the time you get there it'll be easily explained he's not allowed to do that he is specifically told not to do that so the only way he can do it is come along and start preaching and start ripping types out of the bible types out of the bible in every message he's pulling this type of this one and this type of this one and then he starts saying now do you remember sunset mountain now do you remember sabino canyon now you remember this and he's trying to show you without telling you what's happening because he's told not to explain it and the confusing part is when you start to see the theme that he's pointing at and when he starts to point at this scriptural type in this pattern he comes and he preaches this day this scripture's fulfilled and he's placing us exactly in the scriptures where we are where jesus stopped his ministry he has to come back and pick the ministry up now and the vengeance of the day of our lord amen and now brother branham's coming he has this supernatural experience when he's breaching birth pains which is the sixth seal which is the judgment of the earth and he has his experience now where his pages stick together a priest has to come and he says he's in all of his robes and he's got his name he's in full priest garb amen it couldn't be another preacher in a suit god had it so ordained that you wouldn't miss that this is exactly what happened when jesus amen was in nazareth and he says here read it out of my book because the priest handed him the scroll and he read it jesus reads it brother brennam reads it he hands it back to the priest amen and then he goes on preaching birth pains he goes on preaching judgment and then he goes on praying what's he preaching he's preaching the latter half of the verse where jesus stopped 2000 years before and now this whole scene takes place so that you and i can see this is the son of man ministry this is jesus christ and he's come back and he's picking up right where he left off and brother branham comes and he preaches amen this day the scripture's fulfilled and in there he starts laying out all of this stuff amen but he can't sit you down and he can't say now i'm malachi 4. and revelations 10 1 happened exactly like this and when i said this it was this scripture and when i got to the seventh thunders when i was preaching the seals i was actually christ with a loud roar thundering out seven thunders under their voice he said he can't do that he's not allowed to do that the angel told him not to do that amen that is not to be explained it's to be revealed to the predestinated bride [Music] and so now we'll start quote searches and quote wars and he said this and he said that and he said this amen brother branham was not explaining it in detail he was expecting us to pick up the theme of the ministry to read between the lines to catch what he didn't say one of these days i'm going to put together all of those quotes and i'm just going to come up and throw them up here so we could read them amen so you could catch what i didn't say so you could read between the lines i said just enough that you the spiritual will catch it amen he's not allowed to explain the third pull the seventh seal amen it's not his job to get you to understand it it's his job to preach it amen and it's the job of christ himself to reveal it to the bride and the bride will catch it her eyes will come open she says that's it that's him that's my mate the revealed word that's my husband and if that's my husband and he's unveiled himself to me that must mean i'm the bride [Applause] amen god's not just going around unveiling himself to every girl that's out there amen he's only unveiling himself in the secret chamber and the third pull amen in the holy of holies and only to his wife hallelujah so you can get into all kinds of debates and wars and ideas because we've missed the simplicity of the fact that the third pull was not to be explained you say well brother ben didn't say it that way brother branham wasn't allowed to say it that way brother branham after the seals he comes to a place where he says now we all know we're waiting for this one this prophet to show up and come on the scene he said that after the seals so i'm going to take a quote after the seals and that quote if i take it as an absolute fact that means brother branham could not be the fulfillment of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7. he says sometimes things are said in a certain way just to throw them off he can't tell you i'm malachi 4. he can't tell you this is elohim in flesh all he can do is read the story and then turn around at the end of service and start descending discerning the thoughts and the people's heart behind him but he can't tell you elohim is here in this prophet amen all he can do is read the scriptures and display the sign of the messiah it's not to be explained it's to be revealed hallelujah they say brother branham never said this and he never said that oh he most certainly did but he said it to the bride he didn't say it to the public amen he said it to the bride well on what tape is he only speaking to the bride all of them especially amen when you get down into the ministry brother brennan preaches the seals and he's going out and you can still hear him preaching in an evangelistic way after the seals he comes to the end of 1963 i believe it's a message in december of 1963 and he's away from his home church and he's preaching to the people amen and he's come to the end of the service and he's calling an altar call calling people to repent and he makes the statement how do you know that your name won't be the last name that's written in the lamb's book of life tonight and then the book will be closed and not another name written now that's exactly contrary to what he teaches as a doctrinal fact he says nowhere in any place is there ever uh in the scriptures a record where jesus christ is currently compiling names he said that was compiled before the foundation of the world no names being added to it amen so he's not hey listen brother branham is not contradicting his teaching he's preaching in an evangelistic way to denominational people and he's preaching in terms that they understand but when he's teaching and breaking down the word amen he is teaching the type he's breaking it down he's teaching amen there's no names being added to the lamb's book of life there's no names being added to the book of life amen there can be a name blotted out of the book of life but no name can be added all the names were added before the foundation of the world so you have to believe the prophet amen and see the big picture by revelation in these statements are not stumbling anymore it's after the seals so maybe there's names being added no he said there's no names being added but then he said how do you know your name might be added oh my goodness it's got to be by revelation you see why it can't be by intellectual because all of a sudden we'll go along and say well i'll look for the last place he references and the last statement he makes as he goes his misery has to be the most correct it's not going to be that way friends amen you're not going to discover him in a quote search you're not going to know the truth in a quote shirt you're going to know it by revelation so we've got to be careful we've got to be careful we don't take somebody else's intellectual idea where they're starting the the the piece together stuff with an intellectual mind and says it says this and says that no it's by revelation amen and the mystery is laying there to be discovered but it's only going to be discovered by one person and that's the bride nobody else is going to discover the mystery they'll hear all the tapes read all the books but unless you're that predestinated elected seed from god you will not get this mystery secret and will not see it you'll still be looking for something to happen that's already happened because we missed it by revelation trying to discern it intellectually hallelujah let's go to matthew chapter one together that was a tangent amen that's why brother branham said above all else pray for revelation not for a bigger brain amen not for a better bible not for a concordance amen don't don't even pray that you can get a message search program because the search program can lead you astray pray above all for revelation it's the most important thing it's the key to the bride overcoming in this day now we'll look at matthew chapter one here we are at the beginning of the new testament we've been through this several times and we're probably going to be through it several more so i'm just going to give you fair warning amen god is good he loves us but starting with verse one the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharas and zerah of tamar there's our first women we're going to look at these four women here in the first six verses tamar pharris begat ezram ezram begot aram and abraham begat aminadab and amina dabigan nayasan and nasa begot solomon and solomon got boaz of rahab second woman and boazby got jesse and no no rahab and bosby got jesse i'm sorry and boaz we got obed of ruth third woman and obed begot jesse and jessie begot david the king and david the king begot solomon of her that had been the wife of uriah bathsheba number four so we're going to focus on these number four and we'll see how far we get we may only get as far as tamar tonight but that would be good that's a good start but i want to lay down something as an understanding as we go into this because these are the four women that are mentioned here in the beginning and the first six verses of matthew chapter one of the new testament it's four women and this number four is a number we've looked at but i want to look at it again as we go into this story so that we can recognize our number four brother branham said in in in the restoration of the bride tree i think that's the one i want the restoration of the bride tree no that's not that's the one i want it's the next one i want to come to but this first one i can't remember what it's out of i believe it's in 1961 i cut the top of it off somehow but in 1961 he preaches on the revelation uh revelation chapter four i believe is where we're at here revelation chapter four revelations chapter five in 1961. he says now remember god's guards of the ark are the mercy seat now remember to how many john saw how many four how many did he see he's seen four four living creatures now watch they've both seen the same vision and four is the number of earth did you know that how many knows now before you have to go into it four is an earthly number sure it's an earthly it's a number of earth of deliverance deliverance now keep that in your mind deliverance because i'm going to strike it just a minute real hard see deliverance now there was three hebrew children the fiery furnace but the fourth one came it was deliverance lazarus was in the grave three days but when the fourth one came he was delivered four is god's number of deliverance all right so we got that four is god's number of deliverance and that's why we have four gospels four gospels bring us to the book of acts the book of acts is deliverance amen so he's talking about the four the four cherubims that are around the throne guarding amen the mercy seat there's four of them he refers to the three hebrew children the fiery furnace the fourth one was this was the son of god himself amen christ himself which is the deliverer lazarus in the grave three days the fourth day he was delivered now in the message restoration of the bride tree from 1962 he said four killers took it four messengers destroyed it and he's talking about the destruction of the bride tree four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restore her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live wish we had time i got it wrote down here but i have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of the coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones come forth but the life only come not when the senior skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when came come back that fourth message of life so he takes he takes the dry bones in ezekiel and it's a mighty army and it's laying there as dry bones in the valley amen is sick in these bowen lids he says thou knows he said prophesy so he prophesied and bone came to bone then sin you came upon it and then flesh and they were standing up erect a mighty army but there was no life yet and he said prophesy again when he prophesied again the breath of life came into him and it's the fourth stage that brought life there was these four anointings that we find in in revelation chapter six when he begins to open the seals and the first seal open amen and he heard the voice of the first beast amen and or he heard the the beast say come and see the first beast and there was a lion and so now we're talking the church ages the first four seals cover the church ages the first four creatures cover the anointing over the over the church ages so you have lion oxman and eagle all of the anointings that cover the seven church ages so four anointings cover seven church ages four stages of destruction destroy the bride tree four four stages of restoration bring it back again all right so four is restoration and four is tied to the church ages brother brahm says in the masterpiece notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself now listen this is the fourth stage so the baptism of holy ghost wasn't the finish that was the husk or that was the shock but the baptism holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself back to the original seed back to the same jesus christ that went in the ground come back out as the grain amen the holy ghost itself back in perfection again the word that's the fourth stage the fourth stage of life amen the fourth stage of restoration so we've got in this number four we've got justification sanctification baptism of holy ghost the holy ghost itself we've got lion ox man and eagle and under the eagle anointing amen is the message of deliverance you have stalk tassel shuck and seed we have luther wesley pentecost in the word and bride so we see the four stages all right so it's really clear to us four is the number of deliverance there's four stages we could go all through the bible and find this four but you you'll have fun doing that you go and do that we're going to just now look at at the story of tamar so if you look at matthew chapter 1 verse 3 it says and judas begot pharas and zara of tamar now judas judas is the fourth son of israel all right so judas is number four himself so this is gonna show up all through this story this number four this number four of deliverance and then back to seed everything we just talked about we're gonna find in this story because what is god doing he is hiding the mystery in the types he's hiding in the characters slowly letting out but never revealing the whole thing until he gets to the end and then you can look back and say he's there and he's there and he's there and he's there and if we go back let's go back to genesis chapter 38 together genesis chapter 38 we're going to look at the the life of tamar now i've decided i made a decision and my decisions don't always stand when i get in the pulpit but i decided that i'm going to go slow and we're going to do a bible study so keep your bibles open and stay with me and we'll see what happens so if you look chapter 37 starts off talking about the life of joseph joseph is favorite of his father joseph and we know joseph is a type of perfection he's a perfect type of christ we know that it's the type of christ in all brother brendon explains in detail all that he's done is typing christ and and here he's the beloved of the father hated of his brethren in verse 37 they hate him they take him they throw him into a pit amen then they they they take him out and they sell him to a band of medians going to egypt then they tear his garment they dip it in goat's blood and show it to his father and father believes that he's dead amen and and so verse 37 ends uh chapter 37 verse 36 says in the median medianite sold him unto egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaoh and captain of the guard so now just as soon as joseph a type of christ gets out of the way we inject a chapter here that's different than all the others because if you look at chapter 37 starts talking about joseph skip 38 chapter 39 joseph 40 joseph 41 joseph 42 joseph 43 joseph 44 joseph 45 joseph it's the whole story of joseph it's all about joseph but we're going to break into the sequence and tear open something in the life of joseph which is a type of christ and after joseph is rejected of his brethren amen after he's thrown into pit assumed his dead how he's how he's sold out for 20 pieces of silver after that he's off the scene and we're going to tear open the story of joseph amen between his first and second comings and we're going to inject the church ages right here in chapter 38. amen this story repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and not every type tells the exact same story it's always unfolding another angle amen and more color amen this one's in black and white this one we add a little color this one we have a few different colors and you put them all together and you can find the bride and working our way all the way through the old testament you can find the bridegroom and the bride the type of the male and the female working its way all the way through so here in the life of joseph after he's favored amen after amen he's the covenant son with a coat of many colors the rainbow covenant he's rejected amen he's cast down he's sold out amen and he goes down into egypt and he's gone and he's off the scene and right here we're going to inject a story that doesn't fit with everything else that we're talking about joseph joseph joseph joseph joseph and right here we're going to tear it open inject this and go right back to joseph why because you have in the life of christ they mean you've got to inject the church ages where do the church ages come in in the breach amen when you tear apart the seventh week amen after three and a half years amen in the 70 weeks of daniel amen he's cut off and then the church ages come in amen and then it's going to come back to three and a half years in the tribulation when he's dealing with the jews again so right here you've got to tear it apart and stick to church ages in here so chapter 38 is the church ages right here in the old testament in the story of the life of joseph and i i'm gonna i'm probably gonna jump all over the place you just forgive me but i love you amen so i want to find something here there's an interesting relationship between judah and joseph all right let's look here in first chronicles if you could skip over to first chronos we're coming back to genesis 38 so if you want to save your place there i'll try to do the same thing first chronicles the chronicles of the kings chapter 5. first chronicles chapter 5. now this is a slight diversion but i think it's going to help us understand why we've got joseph and judah right here in the story chronicles chapter 5 verse 1 now the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright for judah prevailed above his brethren and out of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was joseph's so this becomes really important the firstborn is supposed to get the birthright so reuben was supposed to have the birthright but that didn't go to reuben because reuben defiled his father's bed and the birthright didn't go to the second or the third or the fourth it skips all the way down to the seventh i wonder why the birthright jumps all the way to the seventh it's amazing let's look at that in genesis 49. no no i'm sorry genesis 35. go back to where we were in 38 and go back a couple chapters and look at genesis 35. and look how they order the birth the birth here and we're going to look at genesis 35 23 is not ordered in chronological order verse 23 it says the sons of leah reuben jacob's firstborn and simeon and levi and judah see judah's number four number four we already said the chief ruler the governor will come out of judah number four so who's coming out of judah number four is the number of deliverance so the deliverer will come out of number four because it's judah's line is the king line it's judah's line when you read matthew chapter one amen in the reading through it's judah's line that we're reading through coming all the way to christ because the deliverer has to come from number four because number four is the number of deliverance amen simeon and levi and jude and issachar and zebulon now we go to the sons of rachel second wife joseph and benjamin seven and eight isn't that amazing seven and eight you've got amen you've got christ and the bride and benjamin the 144 000 properly placed in numerical order and then he goes to the concubines and the sons of bilhah rachel's handmaid dan and naftali and the sons of zilpah leah's handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of jacob which were born to him in padman aram so now we see the way that the bible orders them is perfect the birthright amen jumps from the first born of the first wife to the firstborn of the second wife why is that because the bible brother branham tells us that his goal all along was to have a gentile bride from before the foundation of the world his goal was to have a gentile bride amen and adam had the inheritance to all things and adam lost his inheritance so god comes and chooses abraham who is not a jew amen abraham is from ur of the chaldees he's not jew there's no jew yet amen before there was jew he called abraham and he brought him into the land and what adam lost he promised that abraham's seed is going to inherit it so there's a restoration promise to abraham seed not as a jew not as circumcised but as a non-jew he receives the promise of inheriting all things the thing that adam lost is now promised to abraham's seed not as a jew not a circumcised but it's a gentile promise for a gentile seed for a gentile bride [Applause] and so why does he have to change his name from abram to abraham a-b-r-a-h-a-m seven letters it was six it's got to go to seven why seven church ages gentile bride his name has to move to seven letters to signify the church ages but there's another reason god has to change his name because god has already ordained that there's going to be an end-time gentile prophet and that prophet's name is b-r-a-h-a-m seven letters so abraham's names changed from abram to abraham and brother branham comes at the end to confirm the promise that was given to abraham amen and be there to recognize christ's coming as the redeemer with the title deed in his hand now the promise coming into the hands of the seed of abraham that prophet has the same characters same number of letters b-r-a-h-a-m whatever spell it for me next time seven letters and we think we can check brother benham with the bible and correct him he was ordained from before everything was lining up all the way in the back indicating what it was going to be at the end because god already knew the end from the beginning and god is lining it all up to come to come to pass so now now he always wanted to have a gentile bride and that was his goal is always to have a gentile bride is that what brother brahm told us so now we come to the story of jacob who's going to become israel prince with god and now jacob he wants a gentile bride he wants rachel that's his desire from the beginning is to have rachel right but something happens and his father-in-law tricks him and he finds out that he's married to leah he didn't want leah he wanted rachel amen and god always wanted a gentile bride amen but first he comes to leah the jews but what he wants is rachel the gentile bride so he works his seven days that he's promised he works through the old testament amen and he gets leah the type of the jewish bride and he marries leah and when he when he goes into her and marries her he realizes this isn't the one i wanted i've been tricked amen but he doesn't put her away he holds on to her amen and he says what must i do to get the one that i wanted and he says if you'll promise to work seven more years and he promises right then to work seven more to he promises then to work the seven church ages because now joseph has come between two dispensations of seven now christ has come as the redeemer to die on the cross to pay the price to get leah and rachel at the same time so the at the end of seven years he gets leah and then he promises seven more and he's given rachel and marries her amen so for seven years he's married to rachel but rachel can't have a baby seven years no baby no baby no baby no baby then all of a sudden she conceives and brings forth and lo and behold who comes forth joseph the firstborn from the woman he originally wanted that's why the birthright goes to joseph because it was joseph he wanted to come through rachel it was never supposed to be reuben through leah he wanted a gentile bride and through that gentile bride he would reproduce himself on earth again and that's where the birthright is going to be so reuben had to fall because by the law amen reuben had a right to the birthright but when reuben fell in sin and took his father's concubine now jacob has a right to take that birthright and not assign it to number two number three number four but come down to the firstborn amen of the life he wanted from the beginning and give the give the promise of the birthright and to the firstborn of the chosen bride hallelujah friends this bible is amazing the prophet he doesn't get time to go through and explain every one of these details he said i just hit the high places just enough so that you'll know what it is you take these things and study them out what's he doing he's showing us the pattern he's showing us all of this stuff he doesn't have enough time in his ministry to tell us all of these things amen but he makes statements that he doesn't qualify he makes statements in the birthright and this woman in bringing forth christ and he and he says all of this and he doesn't qualify but if you just believe what he's saying and you go back and look in the bible everything he's saying he's taking right out of here amen and he's pulling out of the types truth that he's just preaching as truth but he's not telling you every time he i got that out of joseph's life and i got that out of jacob's life no he just recognizes true he preaches as it's true and when we go back and we see we say that's where he got that that's where it comes to the seventh that's where it comes to rachel's a seed coming forth from rachel it's all laying right there so the scepter the right to rule went to judah the first born forth because the four is the number of deliverance but the birthright comes to the seventh which happens to be the first of the right woman it's too perfect it's too perfect i hope i'm not losing you with all these numbers take out a pen and paper and just write them down because brother bam said if you miss the numerology of the bible you've missed the bible so hallelujah so we we find out let's look at one more passage of scripture genesis 49 just so we can see this promise to judah genesis 49 and 8 judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee why because the king is coming out of judah david came out of judah solomon came out of judah christ come out of judah thy children my father's jones shall bow down before thee judah is a lion's welt from the prey from the the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him the scepter the scepter is the rod to rule the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the shall the gathering of the people be so this is a prophecy of coming of christ so now the scepter shall not depart from judah so the kingly lines coming through judah christ that's why the genealogy is so careful in matthew chapter 1 to show that this is the genealogy of judah and christ is coming but christ is coming in such a unique way that he's he's now collecting these split promises where the right to rule goes to judah and the birthright goes to joseph now when jesus christ comes on the scene they come back together as one the right to rule and the birthright in him and we're joint heirs let's go back real quick to matthew i want to show you something just quickly now we've firmly established judah number four fourth born fourth tribe judah the right to rule the scepter the scepter will be in his hand amen the kingly line number four deliverance number seven the birthright goes to the firstborn of the right woman joseph so joseph and judah and christ is typing both and it comes together in christ so now we see these genealogies coming all the way down through but something funny happens when we get towards the end if we get go back to 16 verse 16 matthew 1 verse 16 and jacob begot joseph and jacob begot joseph and jacob begot joseph he's tying the two together right now the line of judah and the birthright of joseph is coming together because it's even in the same order jacob begot joseph and now it's going to come through the woman that joseph is betrothed to why these names why not aram and azram and abinadab and all the other names why do we come right back to jacob and joseph again because christ is coming with the right to rule and the birthright every name every punctuation is perfectly placed hallelujah let's go back to genesis 38 hallelujah i like this slowing down a little bit stuff these are the things that we just skip right over sunday after sunday after sunday but i don't want to skip over them these nuggets are solid gold amen we're always trying to hit the high places praise the lord we got time it's cold and snowy who wants to go out in the snow anyway let's just stay here and talk about these things hallelujah so now let's look at genesis chapter 38 we're going to look at the church ages inserted here in the life of joseph and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned into a certain edualamite whose name was haira and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua and he took her and went in under her so now judah listen this is very important judah went down from his brethren he didn't stay amen in the camp he didn't stay with his brethren he went down from his brethren and he went when he went down he found a canaanite whose name washua this word yeshua this name means wealth so now he marries the daughter of prosperity the daughter of wealth and now we see the church ages clearly coming through because the beautiful rich church is the false church and he comes through and he marries amen a canaanite a daughter of a canine named yeshua whose name was wealth amen and he took her and went in under her and she conceived and bear a son and called his name er and she conceived again and bear a son and she called his name onan and she yet again conceived and bear a son and she called his name sheila and he was at cesib when she bare him now i'm just going to point out a couple things and we'll get to it here in a little bit but he has one two three sons by this daughter yeshua the daughter of wealth the canaanitis and he has three sons and after when he gets to the third son it says she bear sheila and he was at cesib when she bear him this word cheseb means false now we're going to see that we've gone through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost we've gone through we've gone through stalk tassel shock and the shock looks like the seed but it's not and here here's sheila comes down and he's born false looks like seed not seed it's just a shock hallelujah i told you the church ages are right here one two three sheila and she was born at false verse six and judah took a wife for ur his firstborn whose name was tamar now there's when tamar is going to slip in she's the first of the four woman women in the genealogy in matthew chapter 1. and so tamar has an interesting meaning to her name and i want to look at this just real quickly amen tamar means palm tree and palm tree has a significance in the bible amen none of this is by mistake and i want to qualify something early on i have no idea what all of this stuff means it just as it reveals as it fits you see it and you just talk about there's a lot more here yet to be discovered amen we're not catching at all first time through i'll tell you that but i bet we circle back around again and catch more so you just read it all read it we'll pray and god will just keep popping things out now i'm going to read some scriptures to you can write them down but for the sake of time it won't all turn but psalms 92 12 says the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon and many times the righteous are typed with the palm tree because the palm tree is a very tall tree and it stands very erect and there's no break no limbs nothing it's straight and it types uprightness and righteousness and it goes all the way up to a crown of palm leaves at the top and has fruit at the top of the tree so it's it's a type of the righteous who are upright amen and not defiled there's no branches there's no breaks it's straight up unbroken so the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon in the song of solomon's chapter 7 verse 6 he says how fair and how pleasant are thou o love for delights this thy stature is like to a palm tree so here the bridegroom is describing the bride and he says your stature is like a palm tree in judges chapter 4 verse 4 says endebra now now we've come to number four remember we're laboring on number four so now we've come to judges chapter four verse four to deborah the fourth judge of the judges and the fourth judge happens to be a woman hallelujah and deborah prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time verse 5 and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between rhema and bethel and mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment so this is such a famous place it's named after she lives under the palm tree of deborah hallelujah because the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree now when we come to john chapter 12 verse 12 we're describing jesus's entry into jerusalem before he's crucified said on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was come to jerusalem took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord so you see it's not just by coincidence her name is tamar tamar amen means palm tree and palm tree is is a sign of righteousness or uprightness and we're going to find this in this story as we continue on now let's look at back at verse 6 again in chapter 38. and judah took a wife of ur the firstborn whose name was tamar in ur judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him and judah said unto onan go into thy go go unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother and ona knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went under his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore wherefore he slew him also so now the first son now they're married he marries tamar amen but tamar is not going to conceive by this first son because the seed is not coming forth in justification it's not going to come forth in sanctification it won't come forth in the baptism holy ghost but the seed will come in the fourth stage of deliverance and the fourth stage of the plan when it comes from the shuck back to the seed again amen so all three stages there's not going to be any seed although she was receiving her seed it never took remember what we said last time it's a predestinated womb for a predestinated position to bring forth why could the first husband bring forth no children she married amen they were living a married life amen but he was wicked and god took him and so judah said raise up seed to thy brethren amen and now he's told to perform the rights she's got a right amen because now she's the wife of the firstborn now the firstborn seeds got to come through this woman because onan is not to raise up seed for himself he used to go into tamar to raise up seed for his brother and onan is so wicked that he doesn't care about the birthright of judah he doesn't care about the leanings of christ he only cares about himself amen and he refused to give seed because it would mar his own birthright amen he wouldn't get the seed he would lose the inheritance now that earth's off the scene onan is the one who can inherit everything do you see where the devil is standing here in onan amen amen onan i mean the devil got adam off the scene he got adam the fall now the title deed of redemption has been lost and going up to the hands of the original giver and now onan comes on the scene to sit as a squatter and take possession of all the earth do you think that he wants her to conceive by the right seed line and bring forth christ absolutely not he doesn't want that to happen he's been working overtime to block that conception from happening and onan is called wicked because he wants to keep the birth right he wants to keep the inheritance but he's told by his father amen to bring seed for thy brother and he knew it wouldn't be his seed and so he refused in his wickedness he was wicked onan is just like amen the devil keeping the children of god from their promises keeping them from the revelation because if they get the revelation amen they're going to come to the right source receive the right seed and they're going to bring forth the firstborn and he's going to lose his inheritance if we take this and follow it all the way over in book of ruth in the book of ruth amen ruth comes back and she lays at boaz's feet and says die as a near kinsman and he says i am a near kinsman but there's a kinsman nearer than i and brother branham said that's the devil because of hybridization in the garden because of sin amen we come belonging to the devil first in this hybrid flesh amen and he was the one amen so when we go to the the bow as boaz comes in the city gate and he begins talking to the nearer kinsmen he says he says now amen nomi naomi's come back her inheritance is available you can have all the land you can have the earth you can have it all and he says i'll take it deal he says but you have to take ruth the moabite as his wife to raise up seed for the dead that seed is the one that was going to inherit it all right all that naomi had lost all the inheritance that was gone when you come in to ruth amen who ruth amen was the wife of the son amen and before she conceived she died and now a near kinsman will come give her the seed from the right line amen and that firstborn is going to be the one inheritance so now the nearer kinsmen which is a type of the devil the nearer kingdom says i cannot redeem brother branham says because he's not clean he's defiled because you have to be clean in order to redeem i cannot redeem but now the one that's near in the book of roots says i cannot redeem lest i mar satan's eden unless i mar mine inheritance how did he inherit it he caused sin in the garden of eden and man lost his right and now the devil steps in and he possesses not because he have rights of not because he has rights from the title deed but he has rights in the absence of the title deed and he sits as a squatter because nobody can make claims on it and if he will help get the bride to the full revelation of the full word where she reproduces a son he loses his satan's eden there's only been one story in the bible this bible is only telling one story he cannot do the work of redemption one he can't because he's defiled two he wouldn't do it anyways because if he does it he loses his right to satan's eden because this whole earth is coming back to the seed of abraham amen that's the promise so here onan because he knew it wouldn't be his because he would lose his inheritance because he could no longer has firstborn rights now he refuses to give seed and god kills him hallelujah i don't know about you but i love the word all right let's keep going verse 10 and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore he slew him also then said judah to tamora his daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy father's house till sheila my son be groaned for he said lest per adventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house and in process of time the daughter of yeshua judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up into his sheepshears to timnah he and his friend hira the adulamite now here she's supposed to get the third son to come to the third stage of redemption but she's told to wait to go back to her father's house until sheila yeah sheila is grown and so now she goes back to his father's house but sheila is grown now and not given to tamar why because you don't get the seed in the third stage you get the seed in the fourth stage so now now tamar goes back and now judah's wife dies so with judah's wife dead where will the fourth husband come from where she can't get it in the third stage three sons where is she going to get the seed where is the fourth son at let's just keep reading verse 13 and it was told tamar saying behold thy father-in-law go with up to timnah to shear a sheep and she put her widow's garments off from her and he covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned into her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me now come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in under her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the edualamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the wayside and they said there was no harlot in this place and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place because she wasn't a harlot [Applause] there's no harlan in this place because she's not a harlot she has a right to the original seed she has a right to bring forth the firstborn she has redemption rights and her rights are being denied her and you come to the third stage and in the third stage there's no seed given to her amen so she's got to go beyond the third stage and come to the fourth stage and when she goes to the fourth stage it's not another son amen it's back to the original seed giver in the beginning it's back to the father not er not onan not sheila but when she comes to the fourth stage it's the original seed amen not another son not a second-hand experience but back to the original seed again she asks what were you giving me what pledge says what do you want she didn't hesitate she didn't ask you know new car or a new dress she wanted three things a signet ring his seal she wanted his seal his binding cord and his staff now i'm not going to pretend to know what all that means but i know it means a lot but i'll just share with you my revelation and what i see amen so she asks for three things the signet ring the binding cord and the staff the signet ring is judah's seal it's a symbol of his person because only that seal in his person could seal and only by his stipulations according to how he sealed it could the seal be broken so the seal represents his person so what's she asking for the seventh seal she's asking for the person the seal of christ the binding chord which i'm not sure what it represents it's a chord the definition is an accord or a twisted cord many people believe that it's different kinds of binding some some say a head wrap some say a binding that binds the signet ring to the rod or or ties the signet ring around the neck i don't really know i didn't see where brother ben said anything but but she asked for three things and then the third is a rod now i want to look at this rod for just a second she asked for the seal for the binding cord and for the staff and this staff the definition is a staff a branch or a tribe a branch of a wine or a tribe or the chief of a tribe to understand the significance of the rod we've got to go back to numbers chapter 17. because in number chapter 17 there's a dispute over moses's choice for his brother's family to be the priests remember that they started saying now how can aaron be the priest we're levites also amen and god told him to choose aaron and his sons but now there's a dispute and in the dispute god says bring 12 rods all the princes of the 12 tribes bring their rod each rod represented a tribe representing a family and they each brought the rod and they took it into the sanctuary and laid it before the lord and he said the rod that buzz and blooms is the rod that i have chosen so they all inscribe their name on the rod they lay them in there moses comes in later amen and he pulls them out and they're all dead sticks but but aarons and aaron's has bloomed butted and bearing almonds it's already bearing fruit [Music] it's the one with life in it amen so this rod represents a tribe or a family and so now what does tamar ask for tamar now is holding in her hand she is holding in their hand the seal of judah amen she's holding the seal of judah she's holding the binding cord and she's holding the whole family in her hand because what is in her womb is the firstborn of judah with the firstborn rights and she's holding here's a woman holding amen the seal and the whole family without her this family can die without her the lineage of christ is marred she is not amen she is not just wanting a baby amen she is not just wanting a relationship she is not wanting a husband but there's something that she may not understand that's moving her because she is bringing forth christ and it's a motivation that's beyond her reasoning it's a motivation that's beyond amen her thoughts of being prudent her thoughts of being moral amen her thoughts of being correct but it would move her to do drastic things that she probably never thought she would ever do in her life amen but there was something moving her to bring forth the firstborn of judah because she was the wife of the firstborn and the seed's been refused been refused all through the church ages has been refused and in the third stage the holy ghost it didn't have the seed it was just a shock and it was refused to hurt too so what does she do she goes back in the four stage of redemption back to the original life giver back to the original scene and what's her motivation she must bring forth christ she doesn't want money she doesn't want a kid she wants the seal of judah and she wants the family birth rights hallelujah we don't want money amen we don't want prestige we don't want buildings we don't want money on this earth we don't want houses we don't want fame all we want is to bring forth christ that's why that seal means everything to us is the seventh seal open yes i'm holding it in my hand the rod of christ the family of christ it's in me amen i've received the seed in the four states from the original seed giver and i'm holding in the bride she's holding the rod amen she's holding the seal and the binding cord [Applause] it's not about a relationship it's not about a money it's not about a baby it's about the church ages it's about you and i in genesis chapter 38. we've done things we've never thought we would do to get this seal in this rod we've left jobs we've separated from family members we've left churches and friends and family we've done things we never imagined we would do so that we could get the right seed and the right time from the right source and we could get the tokens that prove who the seed giver is let's read just a little bit further let's go to verse 24 and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt the end of the church ages after four stages we find out that this little bride is pregnant and she's accused of whoredom following a false prophet believing false doctrine believing doctrines of devils she's been accused of whoredom but she's not a harlot she's not a amen but she's been accused of it by everybody else and all the other churches and family members and saying you believe things that are false and that's that's not right she's being accused of being a harlot but she's no harlot and judah said bring her forth and let her be burned when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are i am with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet the braces the binding cord and the staff and judah acknowledged him and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to sheila my son and he knew her again no more she comes down to the end accused of being a harlot amen accused of harajuku but she's pregnant she can't hide that she's pregnant hey then it's telling on her there's a seed inside of her there's a life growing inside of her and she can't hide it anymore but she's accused that it's a harlot i mean it's a false thing it's something that's wrong it's devils that are working in you it's all wrong you've been a harlot amen so she comes back before the chief of the tribe amen and she says whoever these items belong to is the man whose baby i am carrying and she shows them the seal and the binding cord and the rod and judah says she's got it she's got the seven seal she's got the binding cord and she's got the right family line she's a palm tree she's more righteous than i she is upright and holy and perfect her little act was an act of holiness it was an act of righteousness because she was motivated by a godly desire let's keep going he knew her again no more and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb huh imagine that she's going to bring four twins i wonder if that's ever happened before twins were in a room and it came to pass when she travailed that one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first so you have one that breaks forth first amen but his hand comes out she wraps a cord or scarlet cord amen and his hands withdrawn and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon me therefore his name was called ferez and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zara why because the types have to stay true amen it wasn't the first one that looked like it was going to come forth but it's the second one it wasn't esau it was jacob it's not cain but it's a boy amen so he sticks it out sticks out his hand writes the court on it he's the one who's supposed to come forth but no fair as is predestinated there's a wrestling going on inside and as soon as the way is cleared as soon as his hand comes back in boom he bursts forth and he says how is this bursting forth and your name shall be fairest which means breach breach a breaking forth or a coming forth so tamar in the fourth stage of redemption brings forth from the original seed one that will burst forth out of the breach to come and reveal the rights of the firstborn the seven church ages laying in chapter 38 of genesis and the life of joseph friends it's more than a coincidence fair pharas now becomes which son number four he becomes the fourth son and in him is the lineage of christ and when you read down it's fair as you begot ezra ezram ezram abinadab all the way down through and here everything that brother rams told us and all the time we see it break forth right here in genesis i tell your friends it's amazing then when we're done when we're done here in 38 we go back to 39 and joseph was brought down to egypt it's injected in the breach it's in the gap in the 70th week it's all right here then you go 39 then you go 40 41. you come over to chapter 41 and verse 45. it says in pharaoh called joseph's name zaphnath pioneer and he gave to him the wife asanath the daughter of potiphara priest of ahn you go right back from judah right back to joseph and joseph works his way through the pit through he works his way through uh the prison house and he comes to the right hand of pharaoh and pharaoh changes his name and calls him zaphnath payne and that name means the revealer of secret things that's the reference in my school-filled bible the revealer of secret things and when he changed his name to the revealer of secret things as the revealer of secret things he's given a gentile bride who did we marry the revealer of secret things who revealed these mysteries who did we get it from amen brother branham was just the mouthpiece amen it was christ who brought forth these mysteries it was joseph who brought forth these mysteries amen and when we knew him as the revealer of secret things then he was given a gentile bride hallelujah how many enjoy the story of tamar let's all stand musicians if you could come appreciate your patience as we slow down and just look at this there's three more women so pray for me i don't know what we're going to get into but just pray that god will open the door so we can see whatever he wants us to see at this time do you see yourself did you look in the scriptures did you look in the mirror and did you see yourself hallelujah you've been laying there all along but now you're here to express this story in your life you're here to express genesis 38 you're here to express amen 41 45 you're here to express it in your flesh today this same story going on now i say thank you lord appreciate you god bless you be safe on the way home let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you for your word lord it's amazing to us how you can take words that we've read dozens of times lord but lord with with your ability to open our eyes you show us something we've never seen before god the only way that we could see that is if you came and broke the bread of life with your own hand revealing us things that we've looked at but not seen and now we can say we see but not with natural eyes lord but with eyes of revelation i pray god that you would let these things go deep into our heart and change us lord give us a greater confidence than we've ever had before that these things aren't just things that came about in this last time but they've been laying here from before the foundation of the world you've been expressing it to gather it all up and reveal it in this last day and not just reveal it on books or takes but to reveal it through us lord i say have preeminence o god and reveal yourself and me we love you lord we pray that you take everyone safely home lord if the roads are snowy and it's cold and windy i just pray that you'd put a angels about every vehicle and take everyone home safely lord and let us go with warm hearts lord with our hearts burning within us because you've been speaking with us along the way go on let us go and share these truths with whoever will sit and listen lord that someone else might see what we can see we love your god and ask for your blessing to be upon us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you do you know that song river of life i got a river of life i think it's number 50. let's pull up number 50. let's sing that song i've got a river of life amen what's in you oh we haven't even tapped into the potential of what's in us we haven't even begin to explore the fullness of the life that's in the bride but i say god let that flow out of me let's sing this song together [Music] okay i've got a river of life flowing out it makes the land to walk and the blind to see oh it opens freezing doors sets the cabin i've got a river of life flowing away [Music] yes i've got a river of life flowing out [Music] i've got a river that [Music] give to me that light abundantly amen
