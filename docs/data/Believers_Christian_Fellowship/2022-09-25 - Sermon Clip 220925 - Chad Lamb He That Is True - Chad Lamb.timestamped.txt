[0:00] what makes us a real bride
[0:04] because the true one he that is true
[0:07] has taken up residence in his body on
[0:11] Earth
[0:11] at the opening of the seals when the
[0:13] veil was taken away from the word and
[0:15] the Mystery of God was given to the
[0:17] bride it unlocked amen and Unbound and
[0:20] Unchained the Holy Ghost to come back
[0:22] into the church
[0:24] what Chained and limited the Holy Ghost
[0:26] partial word rejection of word refusing
[0:28] of God's word amen it was a chain that
[0:31] was binding amen it was limiting access
[0:33] to the Church of the Church of the
[0:35] Living God to the full measure of the
[0:37] Living God it was it was cut off amen by
[0:40] limited word when the word come back it
[0:43] broke the chains off and all the
[0:44] resistance and now the Holy Ghost is
[0:46] come back into the church again
[0:49] and what makes us a real bride is not
[0:52] because I stand up and say I'm part of
[0:53] the real bride but what makes me a real
[0:55] bride is the real bridegroom is in me
[0:57] amen the real bridegroom in you makes
[0:59] you the real bride what makes you true a
[1:02] True Heart A True Believer a true
[1:04] worshiper it's when the truth himself
[1:06] has come into you and living out of you
[1:09] it's not what we've done it's what
[1:10] Christ has done amen we we could never
[1:13] even come to God and Jesus says no man
[1:16] cometh to me lest the father draweth him
[1:18] first amen we can never come unless we
[1:20] were predestinated for known of God and
[1:23] destined to come and God had planted a
[1:25] seed of eternal life down inside of us
[1:27] something he could Quicken with the word
[1:29] in the day and we quit Quicken with his
[1:31] spirit amen and we have come because
[1:33] there's a peace of God on the inside
[1:35] that has the potential to live the life
[1:38] of God what makes us a true bride is
[1:40] because the true one has identified you
[1:42] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:44] a true expression of Bride
[1:46] not because we claim to be not because
[1:48] we line up our doctors not because we
[1:50] say I can cross the t's and Dot the eyes
[1:52] I must have I must come from him I must
[1:56] have his life quickening that seed
[1:57] inside of me it's got to be him in me
[2:00] making me a true bride if not I will be
[2:03] a semblance of a bride
[2:06] I will be a picture or a tie or a
[2:08] foreshadow and I don't want to be this
[2:10] generation foreshadowing a true bride
[2:13] that will come I want to be the true
[2:15] bride amen
[2:16] I want to be surrendered completely to
[2:19] him so that he can have free reign in me
[2:21] and live the full expression of what he
[2:24] always wanted in his bride
[2:27] it can't be me it must be him
[2:31] in me
