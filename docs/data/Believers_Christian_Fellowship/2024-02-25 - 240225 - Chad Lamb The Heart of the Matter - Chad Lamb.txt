Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord Lord lookth on the heart amen God bless you as you take your seats amen I wanted to take out of there for a a subject if we could preach on the title The Heart of the matter the heart of the matter and this is a little bit unusual for me um yesterday I I had an inspiration I had a thought and I was working on it all day and and I was working on notes and I was enjoying the thought and it was a it was a good one I liked it and it come by inspiration one day at the end of service I jotted down some notes and I just felt comfortable and I was working and as I got to evening I kept progressing in the evening and I and uh I started having a strange feeling I started feeling disconnected from my my text and I don't know how to describe that I can't explain that to you but but there's a certain connection that you have with the word as it's growing in your heart and I started feeling disconnected with the text and and then it come along about 8:30 or uh somewhere past 8:30 and I just stopped and I prayed I said Lord why do I feel disconnected with this text uh it's a good text it's good word it's and you've inspired it I know it was inspired and and while I was sitting there praying all of a sudden an inspiration just swept in and just swept right through me and so I saved my I saved my word document I was working on I filed it away and I opened a blank sheet and started from script scratch so I I I just pray for me amen just pull I believe it's the Lord but it's not even a subject that's brand new it's something I've been meditating on for quite a while uh at least a month now it's been a meditation in my heart and I absolutely did not feel ready to preach it I did not feel prepared I didn't feel like I hand a hand on the subject and I still don't amen but I believe it's the will of the Lord so we're going to we're going to move forward and ask God to lead us step by step and as we get into it you'll see why I'm a little hesitant to to preach it I didn't feel personally ready but I believe God put his hand on it and said Now's the Time let's turn together to Numbers Chapter 4 and I just want to lay uh this down as a foundation and and maybe build on there and share with you where my inspiration is in this Numbers chapter 9 this is when uh Moses is rehearsing the law and the ordinances uh to the children of Israel and uh he's going to go over the law of the Passover and the ordinance for Passover and in Numbers chapter 9 and we're going to begin at verse 4 numbers 9 and 4 and Moses spake unto the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover and they kept the Passover on the 14th day of the first month that even in the wilderness of siani according to all that the Lord commanded Moses so did the children of isra Israel and there were certain men who were defiled by the by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the Passover on that day and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day and those men said un unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man therefore we we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in this appointed season among the children of Israel so Moses is now this is they're keeping the Passover and there there was a a Commandment that God gave and the Commandment was that on the 14th day of the first month they would keep the Passover because that was when God originally gave them the Passover Lamb when they were in Egypt and he was going to send a Death Angel by uh he he he instituted the Passover by giving them a lamb and the blood on the lent on the doorpost amen would be a token Amen to the to the Lord to everybody on the outside that a lamb had been slain for that house and the Death Angel would pass and that was the beginning of the Passover and God was very specific in his instructions he told them that they had to be cleansed they had to be purified the leaven had to be purged from the house there had to be a certain preparation in order to partake of this Passover and but they were to do it specifically he gave them a date specifically you are to do this on the 14th day of the first month because that is when I delivered you and brought you out so now there's some men they're in a bit of a pickle now because they have to keep the Passover on a specific time but yet they're supposed to be cleansed and they're not cleansed because they were defiled by the dead body of a man so now what do they do they have to keep it but they can't keep it they're stuck in between now let's look here at what Moses said verse 8 and Moses said unto them stand still and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey a far off yet he shall keep the Passover unto the Lord the 14th day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall leave none of it it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinance of the Passover they shall keep it but the man that is clean and and is not in a journey and for bearth to keep the Passover even the same Soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin so all of the sudden when there was when there was a um an impossible obstacle that these men were they have the law the law was specific the Commandment of the Lord told them take this on the 14th day of the first month but he also told them that they had to be clean now they're stuck in between so Moses inquires of the Lord and the Lord tells him now you can come up with an additional ordinance to the ordinance I'm going to expand the ordinance in case you ever hit this circumstance again now you may take it on the 14th day of the second month so if you're on a journey or if you're sick and God I mean God is so gracious he just expanded his commandment to include those that would be in a journey or those that would be defiled in some way unclean but after he expanded it he said if there's any who's able to take it and they don't take it he sh his soul shall be cut off from Israel so it's still it's still the Commandment of the Lord so let's go to 2 Chronicles 30 together second Chronicles 30 and here in 2 Chronicles Hezekiah has just become king and after Hezekiah become king Ahab and and his house had brought such defilement into the house of God Hezekiah Now commands the priest to go clean out the house of God and we're going to get back to serving Jehovah and that's where we're at in in time here and so so Chapter 30 2 Chronicles 30:1 and Hezekiah sent to All Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manassa that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel for the king had taken Council and his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not Sanctified themselves sufficiently sufficiently neither had the people gathered say together to Jerusalem so we find a situation where now Hezekiah now when he becomes king he starts a purging process to purge the house of God tells the priest to sanctify themselves but they start too late they're not able to keep the Passover on the 14th day of the first month because the priests weren't Sanctified yet they hadn't finished cleaning out the house of the Lord so now he goes to this expanded law amen where God expanded it and made a provision for this and now they come down and they're going to now they're going to keep the Passover and the second month according to what Moses had said all right we're all on the same page now let's go down to uh paragraph 13 and I just want to let you know this is the text that started this meditation in my heart some time ago and we're getting ready to read it and there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the Feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation and they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook Kidron then they killed the Passover on the 14th day of the second month and the priest and the Levites were ashamed and Sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offering into the house of the Lord and they stood in their places after their manner according to the law of Moses the man of God the priest sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites for there were many in the congregation that were not Sanctified therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passover for everyone that was not clean to sanctify them unto the Lord for a multitude of the people even many of Ephraim and Manasseh iser and Zebulon had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it was written I want you to take note of this they weren't cleansed they hadn't Sanctified themselves according to the law they were not allowed to eat the Passover let's read it one more time yet they did eat the Passover otherwise than it was written that means not according to Moses but Hezekiah prayed for them saying the good Lord pardon everyone that prepareth his heart to seek God the L the Lord God of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people what a scripture here we are in the Old Testament under the Covenant of law not the Covenant of Grace and here in the Old Testament when when they get into a conundrum in keeping the law God recognized that they weren't failing to keep the law because of a lack of desire to keep the law but they were actually they wouldn't take it unclean this is in the Book of Numbers they wouldn't defile the Lord's Passover so they come to Moses and say we kept back because we were unclean by the because of a a body of a a dead body of a man and so now but God in his graciousness said now here's the provision for that but now we come to hezekiah's day when when the whole nation had been backslid and and the King Ahab had wrought wickedness and they were polluted and had not been keeping the Passover and now Hezekiah is trying to bring the the nation back to the word back to God back to the right worship and when he's doing so the priests are not Sanctified in time they're not prepared to keep it according to the word the first day or the 14th day of the first month but there's this expanded provision so they move into that amen but the expanded provision was to take those who couldn't take it on the first month and give them an opportunity to take it the second month but there was no opportunity the first month because of the situation they were in amen so now now they come now you have people that want to worship God they want to take the Passover they want to keep the law of Moses they want to honor God but now they're in another pickle because they didn't have an opportunity the first they didn't have time to prepare now they're not cleansed according to the purification of sanctuary not according to what is written now but they want to worship God so Hezekiah the king stands in the Gap and Hezekiah says Lord I pray that you would forgive them and it says amen that those that that that prepare their heart let's read it I just love it he said and Hezekiah prayed this is the bottom of Verse 18 Hezekiah prayed for them saying the good Lord pardon everyone that prepareth his heart to seek God the Lord God of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah this wasn't in the law it wasn't Moses it wasn't written they actually were doing something contrary to the law yes sir Hallelujah when you get to the letter of the law they were contrary to the letter of the law but when you deal with the spirit of the law they exactly matched what God wanted they wanted to worship God they wanted to keep the Passover they were trying to come back to the Lord but they they couldn't do it the right way amen so somebody stood in the Gap and said oh God would you please overlook this amen and the Lord hearkened to he Hezekiah amen why because Hezekiah couldn't change the word he couldn't manipulate the situation he just said Lord this is where we're at and God hearkened to him and healed every one of them oh praise God Amen we think Grace only showed up in the New Testament no it's all the way back there in the Old Testament amen and this is the this is the uh the thought that just started rolling over I thought my you can do the wrong thing for the right reason yes technically it was wrong listen times haven't changed people haven't changed everything's the same amen I'm sure Hezekiah had a few legalists around him you can't do this Moses said they could open the scroll they could go to the book they could read it sir do you understand what I'm saying this is why I didn't feel prepared to preach this because you go too far down this strain it scares me but you could go to the book and you could read the black and white you could read the print you could say Moses said we have to do it this way if we can't do it this way and and and there's no chance for them amen but Hezekiah amen maybe he just had a heart that was in tune with God's heart maybe he understood that there's a reason that God said these things amen and then there was a reason God expanded his own law am mean when somebody wanted to worship him but they weren't able to worship him he already witnessed where God expanded the law maybe Hezekiah is actually catching the nature of God gone maybe Hezekiah amen maybe Hezekiah can see what God's doing amen why God wrote what he wrote and why God said what he said the purpose behind the law the purpose behind expanding the law maybe Hezekiah he may not have the letter of the law and he may not be able to keep the letter of the law but Hezekiah has caught the mind of the [Applause] author and that's what brother bham said he said I may not know my bible really well but I know the author really well amen I think that's a better place to be I would rather know the author really well and have the mind of the author really well and understand what is his intent and what he wrote why did he write it that way and by the grace of God now we come to the end of time where he's taken the veil off of the whole book and showed us what his purpose has been amen why so we can know the author so we can catch the heart of what he's saying amen 2 Corinthians 3:6 I'm just going to read it to you but you can jot It Down 2 Corinthians 3:6 said who also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life let's turn to Jeremiah 17 Jeremiah 17 and un like to begin reading verse 9 Jeremiah 17:9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord searcheth the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings this scripture Thrills me because he doesn't say I'm going to give every man according to his doings he said that but that's not all he said he prefaced it with I search his Reigns and his heart and I'm connecting his doings with his heart amen if God is only judging their doings let's read it again I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give Every Man a according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings if all he wanted to do was see their ways and their doings amen he didn't need to write the first part because he could base judgment solely upon the works the doings the ways and his doings but he's not basing his judgment solely upon their ways and their doings but he's attaching he's he's looking past their ways and their doings and he's looking at the intent of their heart and he's judging their ways and their doings by the intent in their heart amen this is God this is God Amen this is not what people have made God yeah this is God he he's not he you know the two pictures sometimes people talk about he he is not the the uh he's not the god of fire and retribution sitting with a club waiting to smack you every time you do wrong neither is he the doting old grandpa who lets everything go God is somewhere in between these two pictures God has a reality to him he has a natur to him he has a desire amen and to understand God and all of his word amen you have to understand his nature amen am because sometimes it's very difficult to understand because it seems like some people in the Bible get a pass and some people don't I mean we're we're going to have to get down nitty-gritty if you want to brother Billy Paul said in his testimony one time that sometimes it would confuse him because he had people come in with similar situations to talk to brother random and in one circumstance he would tell them one thing in another circumstance he would tell them something different but the Billy Paul it seemed like the same question the same circumstance and the Bible's very much the same way uh so as I started meditating on this I started thinking they did wrong Hezekiah and them they did wrong and they allowed them to do wrong they allowed those that gathered from Ephraim and Manasseh and zebulun who hadn't had time to be purified according to the purification of the sanctuary and not according to what was written and they let them eat the Passover and they took the Passover contrary to what Moses said and I just had fun wrapping my mind around this they were wrong but they were right they were right but they were wrong you mean you can do wrong and be right yes and you can do right and be wrong because it's a matter of the heart let's turn to First Peter I want to just give you just a simple example if we can so just keep pulling and keep praying because I'm just feeling my way through because like I said I don't feel utterly prepared you know for me when I Venture into a subject like this I I it makes me so nervous amen but God is pushing me beyond my boundaries and I'm so thankful for that I thank God for that and I want to move beyond my own my own limitations but but I feel like I'm dancing through landmines 1 Peter 213 1 Peter 213 says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be the king as supreme or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well so we are supposed to obey the laws of the Lamb even Jesus when he was asked about paying taxes he told him you give unto Caesar what is Caesars you give unto God with his Gods brother random picks that up and he teaches us to obey we're we're to obey Governors and magistrates and the ruling Authority and one of those laws that brother venham was pretty strict about was speeding he was pretty tight on it he he he didn't believe that you should break the speed limit he didn't believe that you should intentionally drive over he he he felt like that was the law and we should as Christians obey the law here he says in the message and knowth and not he said yesterday coming up in the car we drove it in 2 days from Tucson here right 2,000 Mi Billy and I and so now that wasn't breaking any speed laws we stayed right I sat there if he's driving I rolled up my fist back like a shotgun with a hammer back and I seen him go over I said wait a minute boy now we're told to give Caesar what Caesars right so that's the law of the land that was reinforced by the prophet the question is if you have somebody bleeding out in your car and they just passed out and they're losing all their blood are you going to speed you mean you would violate the word of God and what the prophet said you people we're going to have an altar call all of you who shook your head yes well I was just testing you but now I know and I saw everyone there's going to be about 200 people around the altar what if somebody's having a massive heart attack in your car and they lose Consciousness tell you a funny story before my second child was born this is a funny story my wife wakes me up in the morning and she goes it's time to go to the hospital we had just come to the message I think we had been believing maybe a year and a half not even that year year year and a half just coming to the message maybe two years brand new babes so we get ready we get in the car we're driving to the hospital and we lived quite a bit a distance from the hospital I can't remember exactly how long it might have been 40 minutes 35 40 minutes and we're driving along and my wife says we need to get there I said okay okay okay so I'm driving and we're going down the highway we lived around Cincinnati at the time we're going through Cincinnati traffic and she she said it again we really need to get there I said okay okay okay we're getting there we're getting there then finally a third time she said Chad we really need to get there and I looked at her and I said I'm going the speed limit God forgive me I think I ended up going five over I just couldn't let myself go beyond that we got to the hospital and Brianna was born 20 minutes after we pulled into the parking lot I should have went faster if I had it to do over we would go faster and I looked back at my childishness and my immaturity I was trying to do everything right amen and God saw my heart God I don't believe God condemn me for doing that it it was because IID lived all my life to myself and I had forsaken all of his laws and I'd come to the truth and I wanted to do everything the right way but I realized uh I had caught the the the letter but I might have missed the spirit and so we learned a few things along the way and you realize the law is in place because there's a motive behind that law there's a purpose behind it and the speed limit laws are to keep people safe and to prevent injury and loss of life so how could I in keeping the law cause loss of life with somebody bleeding out or dying of a heart attack in my car and I keep the letter of the law but I I defy the very purpose that that law is there because the law is there to prevent harm injury and to preserve life so now in order not to break this law I will allow whoever is in a medical emergency to die because I won't break the law and I have just circumvented the I've just destroyed the whole purpose behind the law is that we understand so I hope we're all on the same page so I am not I I'm not condoning lawlessness so please you you have to know me by now I like things black and white I like things straightforward I like things right but I'm learning as we move on in time God is not going to let us to stay in the black and white he's not going to let us stay in the easy decisions but things keep getting more and more complex all the time because God is trying to root out what's in the heart amen right amen he's trying to dig in there and root out of us what's in the heart and he's trying to show us that not by might nor by power but by my spirit say at the Lord we are not going to make this through a set of uh uh Traditions a set of Creeds or a set of rules there not there's not any way that this is possible that we're going to make it all the way to the Finish Line because we've just got a certain thing a standard that we can do no there's going to be things that are going to throw a monkey wrench in our dues and we'll land right in between two Commandments sometimes I don't know if you've ever been there but I've been there amen I land right in between two Commandments right in between two principles of God and I do not know what is the right thing to do and I can't go to a textbook I can't go to case studies I can't go down I can't I wish I could just go to the index pull up my problem find the page number go to that read it and just do it I can't do that because it's going to take spiritual leadership of the Holy Ghost that's going to lead us cuz it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord and I think we're going to have to get comfortable with that as we move on because situations are getting more complicated and it may just be me it may not be you but I feel like things are getting so much more complex amen but it's a perfect situation for us to be tuned into the author and for the author's life to come through US amen Amen in Isaiah 29:13 don't flip there CU we're going to go to Matthew next but I'm going to read it to you Isaiah 29:13 wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips they do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men they're just doing what other men are telling them to do that's their fear of God there's not any genuine in fear no real reverential honor and offering to God from the heart they're taught the fear of the Lord by obeying the Commandments of man the ordinances of man man says you you do this and you don't do this and this is the way we interpret the law and these are the Traditions we've added to the law and by keeping that that's how they learn the fear of the Lord but that's not what God wanted God wanted somebody who actually had a fear of God themselves that they wouldn't violate the law they would would do wrong they wouldn't go contrary to God because of their relationship with God and their fear of God and their love of God and their respect to God not just I did everything the church said do that's the fallacy of religion and that's why religion is so corrupt because it it it makes a false sense of righteousness a false security that if you do everything the church says do and you fall in line with everything the church teaches then you're somehow safe that's that's the fear of God by the precept of man am and listen it doesn't even mean that the church is teaching wrong sometimes you want to say oh that that that dirty church the church might have everything exactly right but if you in your heart don't have the fear of God and you're finding your security and keeping that that church order then then you absolutely haven't come to where God wants us to come yet because he wants us not by the precept of man but in our own heart he wants us to reverence him does God want obedience absolutely absolutely it's been a requirement from day one all the way through he does want obedience but he wants obedience out of a pure heart he does want OB be God's law is not just subject for our whims and our fancies and the way we feel and more conven I mean we can't take this subject that I'm teaching now and say oh man that's complicated that's too hard and I I I don't know what to do so I'm going to take the easier Road and God knows your heart God knows that manipulation in the heart saying brother brother Chad said oh sometimes you get stuck between two things you don't know what to do Hey listen sometimes you know exactly what to do the thing that slays your flesh that kills you that cost you something that's what God's asking you to do amen but we always take The Road Less Traveled God discerns that heart yeah God requires obedience he demands obedience and all of his word is obligatory what do you mean brother Chad we're obligated to keep it God never gave us a command he never taught us a Doctrine amen so that we could take it or leave it all of God's word is obligatory amen but you could obey everything and still be wrong comes down to a Razor's Edge friends it's a matter of the heart the only security we have is in Christ am and a personal revelation of Jesus Christ revealed personally to you amen that's the new birth that's our security let's go to Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chapter 12 and we're going to start at verse one at that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were hunger and began to pluck the ears of corn and eat but when the Pharisees saw it they said unto them Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day but he said unto them have you not read what David did when he was a hungered and they that were with him how he entered into the house of God and did eat the shoe bread which was not lawful for him to eat wait a second David disobeyed the law and Jesus is not condemning him he did that which was not lawful to do and Jesus is using this as an example of why his disciples can pluck corn on the Sabbath and eat it now let's read this again verse four how he entered into the house of God and did eat the shoe bread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them that were with him but only for the priests verse five or have you not read in the law how that on the Sabbath days the priest in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless he said you're trying to hold us to a Sabbath to a Sabbath law that it's a day of rest and it was an ordinance that God gave it was one of the Ten Commandments amen man was subject to that and and intended to obey it I mean in the Old Testament there was a man we saw stoned to death because he didn't keep the Sabbath according to God God told Moses Moses said what should we do with this man and they said have him stoned to death so God is not flexible on his his word it's not it's not like God doesn't care if you keep it or not but here we come to the Sabbath and now they're walking along the field we don't know what the situation is they may not have eaten all day they they they they they're hunger they're just grabbing amen fistfuls of whatever it would be barley or oats or wheat and then just grinding it in their hand and blowing away the chaff and popping the Grain in their mouth and eating the corn as they go through and just as they're walking along and they said your disciples are doing that which is not long awful to do on the Sabbath day and and he goes right to David he said do you not know have you not read that which David did when David ate the shoe bread which was not lawful for them to eat I can imagine the Pharisees sitting there I I mean you talk about a mental nuclear meltdown what do you do with this like I don't I don't even know we're talking about the Sabbath we're not even talking about David and and we're not talking about going to the temple and eating shoe bread we're talking about plucking corn as you walk through the field hi how do you even reconcile this because the Pharisees were playing by A playbook right they were playing the religious game by A playbook and they had manipulated The Playbook and they had they had figured out and they had workarounds built into to all kinds of different things and they were playing by A playbook but Jesus wasn't playing by A playbook because the author was in him amen amen the author of the word and himm were one he knew the intent that that was written for and he knew that the disciples walking along Gathering that corn and eating it was not a violation of God's mind on Sabbath yeah that's amen right and in order to to help them understand amen he didn't say well you know it's only this much weight and Grain and God said he just said why don't you go back and read the Bible and find out amen David it wasn't even lawful he him or the men that were with him he was the king amen but he had Soldiers with him amen and they went they went into the house of God Amen and they ate the showbread what which is not lawful for them to do and Jesus throws this as an example of why it's okay that they did what they did can you see how dangerous this can be if somebody doesn't fear God you can take a principle like that if you don't have a life consecrated to Jesus Christ you can take that principle and you can find any example in the Bible and you can make all kinds of excuses well didn't you read about what Rahab did and didn't you read about oh you're talking about getting down to nitty-gritty now there are some things that only God can judge amen we'll never figure them out too complicated too complex it takes the one who judges the heart heart and the Reigns that'll sort this out let's go to Luke 13 we're going to stay here in the gospel for just a little bit Luke 13:10 and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto Heroman Thou Art loose from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God and the ruler of the synagogue answered with in indignation he was upset and he was offended because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work and in them therefore in them therefore uh come and be healed and not on the Sabbath day what a priest the Lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite do not each one of you on his Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and leadth him away to to the watering and ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound low these 18 years be loosed from this bound this Bond on the Sabbath day and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the Glorious things that were done by him what a scripture Jesus looks at a woman who's Bound for 18 years and tells her to be loose and stretch forth her hand and her hand which is withered is made whole and the only thing the priest can think is you can't do that on the Sabbath day right he was right in one way but he was wrong in the most important way he was right in keeping a Sabbath he was right in honoring God he was right that you should honor God and keep the word but he was completely wrong in what the Sabbath was actually intended for and God's heart behind the Commandment he got the letter but he completely missed the spirit let's go to John chapter 7 John chapter 7 let's look at verse 21 Jesus answered and said unto them I have done one work and you all Marvel Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of Moses but of the fathers and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man of a man on the Sabbath they receive circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken are you angry at me because I have made a man everywh whole on the Sabbath day judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment so Jesus saying you you you guys are your judgment is all obscure you're you're you're so Twisted in your judgment because he is made a man this is another situation where he healed somebody on the Sabbath day and they they're coming against him and but he said but he points right back to the law and he says yeah you're not supposed to do any surval work you're not but but earlier he said but the priest in the temple defile the Sabbath because they're working they're slaying they're SA sacrificing they're offering the morning oblation and the evening oblation they're offering sacrifice the priests are actually defiling the Sabbath because they're doing that which is contrary to the Sabbath but why are they doing it because Moses told them to do it amen they're stuck between two Commandments and now there's another Commandment that you must if you have a male child that child must be circumcised on the eth day and it doesn't matter what day he's born on he has to be circumcised on the eighth day and if circumcision Falls on the seventh day if it falls on Sabbath Saturday then he's got to be circumcised causing the priest to work and and all of the he's doing a he's doing a minor medical Pro procedure and Jesus is trying to show them that you don't even understand what you're talking about he said don't judge by outward appearance but judge righteous judgment that doesn't mean now that didn't mean for them that Jesus was saying don't even worry about the Sabbath now you can do whatever you want that's also not what he's saying amen amen praise God let's go to Mark chapter 2 Mark chapter 2 verse 27 Mark 2 verse 27 says and he said unto them the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath he's show them you what they were doing listen they were bringing control and bondage to People by the word of God but he says you don't even understand the Sabbath the Sabbath was given for man man man was not given for the Sabbath the Sabbath was not to rule over the man the man was the Sabbath was to benefit the man the man's not the benefit the Sabbath the Sabbath isn't the object the man's the object God gave him a day of rest in commemoration of God's rest he gave him a day of rest amen for the benefit of the man not for the benefit of the Sabbath so listen it wasn't for the benefit if we could say the rule or the law okay I'm going to say a rule I hate to say that because it's just God it's just God's commandment it's God's nature it's God's word but the rule was given to bless the man the man's not there to keep the rule God has come and restored his word in this end time and he showed us how to live how to dress how to talk amen where to go where not to go the kind of establishments to stay out of the kind of relationships to avoid who did he do it for he did it for us he did it for our benefit for our welfare to stay out of dangerous situations to keep from compromised positions to keep from our spirituality being Stripped Away to keep our mind from being confused and our bodies from being filed amen taught us not to smoke or drink listen he never did it to bring a group of people under bondage to the ordinance he did it to keep a group of people free from the world Amen right right let's go to Mark 3:4 Mark 3:4 and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil to save life or to kill what a good question is it lawful to drive the speed limit and let somebody bleed to death in your car what a good question is is that the right thing to do because we don't want to break the speed limit law or is it right to get to the hospital as fast as you can without harming anybody to drive as safely as you can as fast as you can safe so you still in the spirit of law you're not coming harm or injury to anybody inside your car or outside of your car we we might find ourselves in more of these situations as as time goes on and we're going to have to have the fear of God on the inside we're going to have to have a respect for God and a respect for his word and there's going to have to be death to self to selfish motives to Pride to self-preservation there's no way listen there's no way this is going to work religiously there's no way this is going to work Loosely this is only going to work when somebody is connected to almighty God and completely sold out that's only way to serve god with a pure heart amen I want to read to you out of Joel I want you to stay here where you at in your Bibles because we're going to go to Matthew next but Joel 2:12 you can jot this scripture down Joel 2:12 says therefore also now sayith the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and Rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful will slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of evil it's amazing how he's saying Turn even to me with your heart with fastings with weeping with mourning because there's a tradition uh with the Jews whenever they they they would contact certain extreme things and emotion amen they would rent their garment so when they would fall into despair when everything would go wrong they'd rip their garment when they would face Abomination against the word of God they would rip their garment but he's saying turn to me even to me with all your heart with fasting with weeping with mourning en ringe your heart not your garment don't just go through the motions don't just get emotional don't just show everybody else that I'm in distress but no Rin your heart tear your heart and come to him with prayer and fastings and Mourns and weepings amen not with the outward show and the outward display but get down real on the inside and Rin your heart and not your garments amen sometimes times I question I question myself why do we do some of the things we do that's a good question to ask yourself sometime why am I doing why am I doing what I'm doing am I doing it for the right reasons that's a good question and only you can answer it and you know why I say that only you can answer but really only God can answer it cuz sometimes you don't even know I've had times in my life where I get down the road a little further and I look back and I realize I was wrong my motive was wrong my desire was wrong but at that time I was blinded to it I thought I was doing right but a little bit further down the road and a little bit more growth and a little more experience and making a mistake the same time a few times you look back and say no I I thought I was righteous and I thought I was standing on the word and I thought nope that was me I was defending myself and I was uh defending my honor my pride my whatever I was doing I was doing it for the wrong reasons amen sometimes we we don't even know sometimes what our own motive are is because the heart is deceitfully wicked Above All Things who can know it amen I tell you who can know it the word can know it amen because the word is a person and that word can divide Soul and Spirit and divide amen the heart and and the and give you the intent of the heart amen we need the person of the word Matthew 15 ver1 Matthew 15:1 then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do you also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commandeth saying honor thy father and mother and he that curses father or mother let him die the death but you say whosoever shall say to his father or to his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesied of you saying this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men I didn't quite understand what the scripture was saying about honoring thy father or thy mother and you're saying to them uh verse 5 whosoever to say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honth not thy father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the Commandment of God none effect the commandment to honor their mother and father was mean to take care of them to provide for them in their old age and so I went and I studied and I tried to find out and the best answer I can get what I believe to be true is if they would dedicate their property and dedicate their land and dedicate it to the temple for their passing it's a gift then they could keep it and all the prophets to themselves because it's dedicated to the temple and they didn't have to share it with their parents that's why you say it's a gift by what you could be profited by me and what did the Pharisees do they made a religious workaround and missed the whole Spirit of what God was telling them God was saying your parents took care of you when you were young you take care of them pretty simple amen but in order to keep their finances keep their property and keep everything they came up with a scheme whereby they didn't have to honor their mother and father and they could stay free and still say in the good circles the religious circles and they look fine because what did they do they had offered some gift or made some dedication and I don't know how it worked and I don't know what it was but they had worked a work around and they made the Commandment of none effect by their tradition say God help us never to do a thing like that help us to never find a workaround but help us to find the heart of the commandment and we find the heart of the author and the Heart of the commandment and give our whole lives to that amen give our whole selves to to finding out what is it that God wants what is it he's pleased with what is it he desires why did he give this commandment why did he share this word with us why has He restored the word in the end time and brought us back to the faith of the fathers it's not for me to manipulate it again like every other denomination did or pass it away or to create another strict structure with it amen that won't work amen what did he do he came back to unveil the author so that you could have the mind of the author so that you could read the word so that you could hear the prophet and you could understand what he's saying and what his desire is and how he wants us to live and how we can be the reflection of Jesus Christ on this Earth by what by keeping his word amen when Adam and Eve fell what's the first thing they did they made fig leaves to cover their nakedness to cover the fall brother bam tells us they made their own religion so that they could feel better so that they could feel covered amen and that's exactly what religion does religion covers sin fig Lea religion false religion it covers sins it makes people comfortable living in compromise but they feel secure because of religion we've all seen it amen we may have all experienced it we may all be guilty of it in one way or another but I want to read to you what brother bham said amen he said now listen this is in the message Fellowship now listen as I close when man lost his Fellowship in the Garden of Eden by sin what did God do about it look what man done about it instead of coming out and being honest and saying father I sin he went back in the bushes and formed himself a religious organization and made himself a covering religion means covering he made himself a man-made religion made him an apron out of leaves fig leaves the Bible said so but he when he come face to face when he come to face God he realized that his man-made religion wouldn't work and neither will anybody else you've got to come to to you got to come on God's basis he said again in the message in 1954 the unconditional Covenant now we know the world religion the word religion means covering and Adam instead of saying God cover me he made himself some aprons out of fig leaves he and Eve and they worked all right as long as God wasn't around yes right woo oh my goodness religion will work all right as long as God doesn't come on the scene remember when they made their fig Leaf religion amen they had their aprons of fig leaes they were fine with it until they heard the voice of the Lord come walking in the garden and when they heard the voice of the Lord they went and hid themselves amen they knew when God came down they knew that those fig leaves didn't cover anything they couldn't hide be behind him and he said it worked all right as as long as God wasn't around but when they come in the presence of God they realized that their fig Leaf religion wouldn't work and brother there's so much of that today I'm afraid that you're going to find the same thing when God comes again that homemade fig Leaf religion won't stand in the presence of God that's still the truth amen it's still the truth our our religious Notions and our coverings and our workaround programs won't stand in the face of God Amen what is it that we need more than anything I'll tell you what we need more than anything we need a prayer life amen we need a dedicated consecrated prayer life we need to spend time in the presence of God and let God that search light of God's presence search out our heart and show us where we're not meeting where we're failing amen because we've got to come into His presence for us to realize I'm naked that's what that's Adam said he says he says Adam where are thou he says I I hid myself because I was naked he said who told you you were naked technically he wasn't naked he had an apron on but that apron was nothing in the face of God in the presence of God it might as well been transparent it worked before man it worked in the natural but it did not work in the presence of God and neither will none of our religion work in the presence of God that's why we need to be in the presence of God we need to be in Fellowship we need to be in our anointed preaching we need to hear the voice in this hour of the Prophet we need to have a prayer life and stay consecrated stay on our knees because if not we're going to move into religion and stay comfortable because we've not moved into the presence of God we don't need less of it we need more praise be to God Amen let's go to Matthew 23 Matthew 23 verse 1 then spake Jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat and all therefore whatsoever they bid You observe that observe and do but do not after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and Grievious to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their Works they do for to be seen of men and they make broad their felies and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feast and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi Jesus is unveiling the heart of the Pharisee the the phes heart isn't centered on God his desire isn't to please God his keeping of his laws and his strict ordinance wasn't to please God because that's that's not whose pleasure he sought that's not whose approval he was seeking he wasn't seeking God's approval he wasn't seeking God's pleasure he was seeking his own pleasure pleasure and he was seeking man's approval so all of his ordinances and all of his keeping of ordinance was for his own pleasure and for man's approval that's a Pharisee brother Bram said in the message God had explained he said I want to say that I believe that both sides are wrong as long as they argue one with another he's talking about two ministers and an argument that was going on in Texas amen between a Oneness and an Assemblies of God Minister he said I believe their both sides are wrong as long as they argue one with the other because their motives is wrong and as long as your motives is wrong no matter what your objective is but your motive to that objective is wrong then it'll never work what was their objective in this argument their objective was to have the truth of the word of God one was Oneness one was assemblies but their motive for doing it was wrong their objective was to have the truth but their motive was to serve their own idea amen their own denomination their own idea and because the motive was wrong brother bham said no matter how good your objective is if your motive is wrong it won't work out right why because the motive of the heart is wrong you're doing it for the wrong reasons so I'll just rehearse this you can do the wrong thing for the right reasons and you can do the right thing for the wrong reasons so where do we want to be I want to do the right things for the right reasons that's where I want to be let's go to uh look here further in 23 23:23 Matthew 23:23 says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of men and Anis and cing and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone he's not saying don't pay your ties yeah now look he says you pay ties of mint and Anis and cumin what is that those are herbs and spices so let's just if you will with me let's just get a picture of this maybe they're growing in their garden and they've got a little Garden on the side of their house and their wife has a little kitchen garden and she's growing some mint she's growing some hum and she's growing some of these spices that they use in cooking they're so careful about the law of tithe that even these little plants that are growing they're tithing off the mint you get the picture how many of you have grown mint in your garden I mean just one little plant is sufficient how much would a tithe off of that be praise God maybe they grew a whole Year's worth and they had but they were so worried about tithing the the spices and the tithing these things but he says you did that and he says you shouldn't leave that undone that's good because that's the law you should do that but you've left the weightier matters of the law what was the weightier matters of the law the weightier matters of the law are the things that's not easy to make a rule about yeah what are the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith how do you measure that amen how do you put that on a scale how do you get a tenth of that how do you measure that they're doing all the outward things and the outside things and and they're so careful about keeping the law for certain things but the the real weightier matters of the law the real meat of it the real reason God gave the word is so that we can learn judgment mercy and faith and they were forsaking that and fiddling around with trying to keep some mint for a tithe and they weren't wrong in doing that they were wrong and focusing on that and forgetting the weightier matters of the law verse 24 you blind guides which strain at a knot and swallow a camel you know Jesus wasn't always the sweetest talking minister in the world sometimes Jesus is painted as this sweet old grandpa and just a softspoken boy I'm telling you the Pharisees didn't think so I told I'm going to say you blind guides which strain at a knat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like and dewied sepers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity boy Jesus called it out you know they were so right but they were so wrong and exactly the same time because they missed the heart of it they got some things and and brother Jesus never condemned them for those things what he condemned them for was missing the real weightier matters the real heart of the law God gave them a law to expose the fallacy of man and to show the nature of God and they took it and they made something that served themselves my goodness help us God it's all I can say is help us God now when we look at Adam and Eve we know the scripture tell us that Adam was was not deceived that's in 1 Timothy 213 if you want to write it down for Adam was first formed in Eve Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression and here's what the prophet says here in 1955 he says now it was said that thought that I said that Adam hadn't sinned Adam was sinned and condemned and was driven from the Garden of Eden by God the Redemption robe over him showed that well what I said that Adam sinned willfully Eve was actually deceived but Adam was not deceived he deliberately sinned deliberately sinned knowing what he was doing because of his wife he took position with his wife then they went before God and both of them was condemned again in another message in 1957 he said the Bible said that Adam was not deceived Adam was not deceived he know just exactly what he was doing he because of the love that he had for Eve he walked right out into death with her not because he had to he know differently Eve was absolutely deceived she thought she was right but Adam knowed better but he walked out with her and took death with her oh my I want to I just want to propose I want to pose a question to you did Adam do the wrong thing did Adam sin did he transgress the word of God was he condemned judged for it is it possible that Adam did the wrong thing for the right reason he was foreshadowing the coming of Christ for the love of his wife for the love of him his wife she was part of him he went with her he failed the word of God he wasn't deceived he wasn't was n deceived in the transgression no he knew exactly what he was doing he did it intentionally and he did it on purpose this was premeditated sin I don't know how to change the Bible he did the wrong thing but I believe he did it for the right reason was he justified in it no he was condemned but God came down and offered a substitutionary lamb so that he could redeem back his son foreshadowing that there's another lamb coming to pay for what was done here today he did the wrong thing it was wrong you can't make it you can't say it was the right thing it was the wrong thing but in some way it was still the right thing because what was Christ was going to do for his wife he was going to come down and go with her amen and take on her wrong even though he never became wrong to do that but he took on her wrong to redeem her back now Adam come down and did wrong to take on her wrong that's why he was condemned and Jesus wasn't condemned because Jesus never transgressed the law So Adam did wrong but I believe this is me personally you may disagree with me but I believe he did wrong for the right reason and I believe it fulfilled a desire in God so God could manifest himself and foreshadow the coming of Christ I don't always know how to sort all these things out David did wrong when he ate the shoe bread Jesus didn't condemn him you know one of the Ten Commandments was Thou shalt not lie do you agree with me Sunday school teachers am I right what did Rahab do when the soldiers came looking for the spies what did Elisha do with the Syrian Army uh I don't know it's just the Bible I don't know how to change it I don't know how to doctor it up I don't know how to put Band-Aids on it all I can say is this is what it is when Absalom ran David come to Jerusalem and David left the throne David had an advisor he trusted that advisor he trusted come to David and said what should I do I will go with you he says no you go back and you pretend to al Ally yourself so you can find out what's going on and get me word back when Absalon comes into town he says oh my my father's friend and trusted advisor why aren't you with him and he he acts like he's faith in he's deceiving like he's supporting Absalon and he's saying oh I can see that you're Now The King and I offer my services to you he was never condemned technically he was wrong technically ah Rahab was wrong technically Elisha was wrong technically Tech Ally but maybe God's not technical just maybe he's not technical listen you can see why I feel like I'm dancing through landmines and why I didn't feel in myself prepared to preach this message because you can take a message like this and you can wre Havoc but it's still the truth amen you can wreak havoc you can you can cause all kinds if it's taken with the wrong Spirit and the wrong nature it can cause all kinds of defilement and unrighteousness and lawlessness amen but there has to be a bride at the end time that has the mind of the author there has to be a people that can navigate difficult situations there has to be a people that can land between two Commandments and navigate their way through without taking the easy Road without serving self without justifying wrong action there has to be a people who's honest there has to be a people who's real there has to be a genuine representation of Jesus Christ upon this Earth in the end time there has to be a people who can walk the razor's Edge and I'm not even claiming to be one of those people yet but I believe that he's going to put me in that position because that's what he's called for at this end time there's got to be a people that can look Beyond amen some of the knee-jerk reactions and and look to the motive of the heart and judge with righteous judgment and deal with the weightier matters of the law praise God oh friends I don't always know I don't always know how to proceed I just know how God leads I don't even know why like for me I would love to button this up so tight and give you the parameters on this truth I can't give you the parameters on this truth this walk of a Christian Life is the most dangerous you'll ever walk there's pitfalls everywhere there's landmines all around you there's millions of ways to be completely wrong and there's millions of ways to hurt yourself and hurt other people there's only one way to be right and you've got to be tuned in with Christ you have to be in him and him in you and you got to be surrendered and submitted to that Spirit that's the only way we're going to make it we listen in all the word that's been restored to us and the word has been marvelous ly restored to us we've got so much word we got the unveiling of the word we've been brought back to the original doctrine of the Apostles but we still find ourselves in situations we don't have a clear answer for in the under the unveiling of the word under the restoration of the doctrine under everything that's been put in the right place we still sometimes find ourselves in situations that I don't know which word to apply cuz two or three may fit in this situation amen that's when you're going to have to be led by the spirit can it go can we go wrong yeah we can go we've always been able to go wrong the Pharisees were able to go wrong what did they do they took the Glorious law which the Apostle Paul never condemned the law Paul never said the law was bad he said the law is perfect that's what Paul said but man was UN able to keep the law so the law was a condemnation for men it was death to him not life Grace brought life but there was nothing wrong with the law it was perfect they took a perfect law which was a perfect reflection of God which was the mind of God which exposed the sin nature of man and and showed the righteousness of God they took it and they manipulated it to serve their own purposes that's what the church ages have done with the new test they've taken it and manipulated it to serve their own purposes God forbid that we would take the message and manipulate it to serve our own purposes this message came to free us from bondage not to create bondage Amen to free us from bondage it came to set the captives free does that mean that we don't have rules absolutely not we believe the word of God in fact that freedom frees you to serve God like you've never served him before it frees you it frees you to surrender frees you to submit frees you to do it from your heart not because of a religious order and not because of what other people will think of you but the reality strikes your heart and gives you a real freedom to come in line with this word like you've never been able to do it before that's real Freedom not freedom from the word but freedom to be the word am brother BM says oh my I just want to share something with you it's just an example I probably shouldn't get into this but I just feel impressed to to move forward so if I'm wrong I'll come back and say I'm sorry but you know that there's a teaching on marriage and divorce and sometimes that's quite hard to navigate through I'm not here to tell you all that's right and wrong in that in that navigation but sometimes the marriage and divorce Doctrine gets taught in a way that a man is free to remarry as long as his wife leaves him you've heard that before and I'm not going to tell you which side I am on and I'm not going to go into that I'm not that's not my point but when you drive that line and you drive it too hard now you say any man whose wife leaves him has a right to remarry you push that too hard then you're going to have a man who in unrighteousness wants his wife to leave him so that he's free to remarry so now you can take the message and push a Doctrine to the point where it actually creates unrighteousness amen right and it creates a man who will treat his wife bad be rough with his wife not serve her needs not love her not give her affection and under that kind of situation A woman won't be able to take it she'll bail and if you just have the strict order of the law that if she leaves him as long as she filed the divorce listen he divorced her long before she divorced him by not caring for her needs that's why you have to have a pastor to sort these things out you can't just make a rule and say Here's the rule because that rule will create unrighteousness like it did in the Pharisees and you'll have a man who won't act like Christ he'll act dirty and he'll act wrong and and will not treat his wife right but in the eyes of the church he's Justified to remarry and this poor woman's thrown to the curve and then thrown into adultery amen he's in adultery amen when you want to get around to the word when you really want to get to the heart of the law what did he do he put away his wife he didn't go to a lawyer he didn't sign paperwork but he put her away emotionally he put her away as a wife and he took another wife he's in adultery right that's right I mean we got to get beyond the letter of the law we got to get down to the reality friends so you see how you can take even this message and you can turn it into unrighteousness by the mind of man amen it's not going to be simple friends it's not going to be easy but it's going to take God Amen it's going to take God it's going to take a surrender it's going to take a death a death to self amen all of these manipulations they ways to preserve self so I don't have to sacrifice so I don't have to die so I can still have my way and I can still look right all that has got to die brother vam says here in the message from 1959 called images of Christ says a Shepherd has to stray to find the straying a good pastor is a Shepherd frankly the pastor the word pastor means Shepherd and sometimes in the church a little C or a little click will rise up in the church one side will get one way one side the other way a real good shepherd will go with the click what to do to bring them back listen a real true Shepherd what's he doing he will stray himself listen I I'm not telling you I understand this I'm just telling you what the prophet said he will stray himself what to do to bring back the Lost what's he doing he's reflecting the image of the Good Shepherd trying to win that soul back if they got off in some place brother like they was going to tear the world up overnight that Pastor will go right along in order to get them right win them right back this way that's a good shepherd he's reflecting the image of Jesus Christ I don't know how this works don't ask me how this works but he says he he will stray himself so how much straying will you tolerate from me you see what I mean this is this is tough how much how much flexibility will you tolerate from the pastor he's trying to win back the Sheep yes I don't ask me how this works I don't know how this works I don't know what situation brother R was addressing he didn't come out and explain it but how much flexibility or are you realize it comes down to the motive it all comes down to the motive of the heart what's the reason behind it what's the purpose that's the only thing that makes it work brother B said one time I didn't write the quote down but he said he was talking to a man and he says you don't believe that do you and the man says no I don't and brother Brandon was going to correct him so you don't believe that do he said no I don't he says but my people do and for their sakes yes and BR and brother Benham said they're legalists aren't they and he said yes they are so here's a man doing teaching living I don't know what it is in a way that he doesn't even believe is right or necessary but he's doing it for the sake of his sheep and brother Branham was actually going to challenge him on it because it's not according to the word and when brother Brenham said that he was doing it for his people's sake and brother BM said they're legalists aren't they and he said yeah brother BM said I wanted to hug his neck he said that's what Christ did for their sakes I Sanctified myself this man is going along with something that's not even doctrinally sound it's not even the word but he's doing it for their sakes was he right or wrong I'll just tell you what the prophet thought he thought he was right there was a time in my life that I would have called him a coward and a sellout and a compromiser God help me God help me to know the mind of the author that's what we need friends is the mind of the author we're not going to find it at work and we're not going to find it on the internet and we're not going to find it fooling around and playing around there's only one place to find the mind of the author and that's from the author himself amen it's the only thing that's going to work brother Bron said in this quote that's a prayer of sincerity certainly he could put them together it's not how we pray in our lips brother Bron just said he talked about the boy who didn't know how to pray he just going through his ABCs somebody said why are you rehearsing your ab BCS that's not a prayer he says well I don't know what to say I just figure if I get out all the letters God knows how to put them together brother R said yes he could certainly he could put them together it's not how we pray in our lips it's the motive of the heart is what God hears he sometimes don't hear our lips he hears Our intention what the motive of our heart amen you remember the interview of sister Bruce we've been talking about it and brother man mentioned it Wednesday T night and the tape and I'm just going to refresh your mind on a part of it sister Bruce in the private interview tells brother B I make so many stakes and I failed so many times and brother B says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him now your mistakes are not looked nor lotted to you he is your propitiation see he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him so what was God looking at in Sister Bruce the desire of her heart she looked at mistakes God wasn't looking at her mistakes he said that's what the blood was for God was looking at her heart in the message discernment of spirit he says now if a man comes and he's a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denom denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what is he trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it I'd have disc sermin a spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his gift operates if he isn't trying to acheve achieve something for the Ben benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with great intellectual or spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so that it'll have a big name so that other Brethren will look up to him as some big person then that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here and that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the picture that's still wrong but if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what he belongs to you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that's what God told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to discern the man's group but we was constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to and then if we can find out what he's trying to lead the people not to break up but to bring them together and to bring the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination but to understanding a fellowship of unity brother R's telling us don't look to the all these outside things he was talking about denomination in that day but you can make it anything another group another church even within the message don't look to all that what's in the heart what's the what's the intention what's this trying to do what he's trying to do with the gift these God and that's not just for preachers brother Brenham was using that for a gifted preacher but but for everyone around us where are they pointing to what direction are they going and what's the desire we may not always understand every action somebody takes amen because those things happen I wouldn't have understand the man who was going along with this legalistic church contrary to the word amen but brother brandham understood because he was doing it for their sakes from the outside brother brandham himself didn't even understand it am until he questioned the man we may not always understand every decision and everything that's made but one thing we can see is what direction are they going in what are they pointing to what is the desire of the heart because that's what God's looking at 1 Timothy 1: 15 let's turn there together together I got just a couple scriptures I want to read and then we'll be done 1 Timothy 1: 15 says now the end of the Commandment is Charity that's love perfect love God's love the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and Faith unfeigned what is the end of all the Commandments all we've been taught and all that God's given us this is the conclusion the end of the Commandment is Charity love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith unfeigned that means without hypocrisy without pretending that's what all of this is coming to so that we can be this so that this scripture can take on flesh this isn't a impossibility friends this is the result of the word being restored this is a result of a surrendered life to Christ and Christ coming in and living his life this is what God wants in his church and this is what I want in my life this is what we're striving for let's go to Psalms 139 this is a prayer a prayer that I want to read a prayer of David we know that David was a man after God's Own heart and even that man after God's Own Heart you know he did some things that he shouldn't have done and he repented and he was called out and he repented but but his heart towards God never ch changed he did things contrary to the law he ate the showbread he he he caused Jonathan to deceive his father and tell him that he went home for a feast day but actually he remained so Jonathan could find out if his father was angry or not and then could meet him in the field to tell him whether he should go home or not that was a whole deception but he was a man after God's Own Heart he sent back his counselor to deceive Absalom to be a spy to be a mole in his cabinet ate the Sho bread that wasn't lawful put on a priest garment and worshiped in the Tabernacle of David and took the incense like a priest before the ark but yet he was a man after God's Own Heart here's what he prayed in Psalms 139 let's go down to verse 23 Psalms 139:23 search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting I think that's a good prayer for all of us search me oh God I don't even know some of the crevices that that sin is hiding in me I don't even know some of the things that that that I don't know but search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting that's my prayer brother B made this statement and the godhead explained and he's referring back to the argument because between the Oneness Minister and the assembly's minister the trinitarian he's referring back to that he said now I said to brother Schism and brother NES to answer your question said now I do not take either sides with you Brethren and I know as long as you fuss you're both wrong see because I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart said after all it's your heart's condition what is it that matters the most it's your heart's condition let's go to Jeremiah 31 and I'm going to end with this with this scripture I'm going to close here musicians if you want to make your way up while we turn to Jeremiah Jeremiah 31 let's go to uh verse 33 Jeremiah 31 and33 he said but this shall be my Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my law and their inward parts and I will write it in their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people I believe that's what we need today I need God I need God to put his law in my inward parts and to write it in my heart I need to go beyond intellect Beyond human effort Beyond human understanding but I need him to put his word in my heart and my inward part and I need him to write it in my heart because he's judging my inward parts and he's judging my heart say search me oh God snow my thoughts find if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way that's Everlasting and have this promise come true for me put your word in my heart your law in my heart and write your word in my inner part am that's the only way I'm going to make it friends I believe that's why the message came so that we could have the word of God in our inward Parts the whole word has come the whole mind of Christ the whole the the whole mind of the author has come so that we we may fumble around in quoting scriptures but we need to know the author real well to navigate situations that are are complex and may become more complex as time moves on we're going to need that law written in our hearts and we're going to need his his precepts in our inward parts and we're going to need him to lead us in the way of everlasting life I need him more than ever before you can do everything right still be wrong you can do wrong and still be right I don't I don't get it and I don't promote it I hope you understand my heart I'm not advising that we try some wrong things to see if they work out right stick with the word stay with the word the word is our life the word has been given to us keep it obey it obey the messenger amen just obey it it's for you amen it's not for him it's for you right surrender to the word amen but not through religion but through a consecrated life surrendered to Christ through a personal revelation of Jesus Christ revealed personally to me and to his life in me and my life in him let that be everything let's have real genuine fear of the Lord not what's taught by the precept of man but what comes from a relationship with God knowing that tomorrow morning when I get on my knees I'll face God and the things that I said and the things that I thought and the things that I looked at will Flash before my face when I kneel on my face before God that's where we get genuine fear of God that's where there's no more pretending when we kneel down in his presence and he unravels us and it's all there and all you can say is God I'm sorry sorry for what I saw saw I sorry for what I thought I sorry for what I did and that genuine fear of God keeps us from taking what would be a gray area or a loophole it keeps us from taking that and just going to serve self and to serve our pride and to make it easier for ourselves what will keep us from doing that the only thing that will keep us from doing that is fear of the Lord because some things are so tricky to navigate you can go by selfish desires and take the word and you can take the word and you make it a religion and you can hide your sin behind quotes you can hide your your sin your selfishness your pride you can hide your own willfulness you can hide it behind quotes you can hide it behind scriptures because if they're taken with the wrong motive they can be manipulated for the wrong purposes religion over the last thousands of years has showed us that what's the only thing that can keep us straight listen it's not going to be it's not going to be a stricter church and it's not going to be a pastor with with more discernment the only thing that's going to keep us straight is our fear of the Lord that's the only thing that's going to bring us through is our fear of the Lord and our honor respect for him amen let's all stand and let's just ask the Lord to search our hearts amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father I thank you Lord you are so amazing Lord God your word is intentionally too complex for us it's too complex for the human mind it takes too many turns it's it's too unexplainable there's so many situations that we can't sort out we can't understand we don't know what to do how to handle God we we run up against things in your word and and things in the message you've given us statements we can't reconcile things that look like they go two different directions what be right in one situation maybe wrong in another wrong in one situation right in another lord it's beyond our ability and father I believe you want it to be that way I believe it's by Design so that we can't have a textbook that we can't have a code we can't have a search program that'll spit out easy answers God we have to search our own heart we have to lay bare before you and ask you to search our heart we have to fear you and love you and put you first above everything else you're looking for preeminence in every area of our life God we want you to have preeminence Lord we want you to search our hearts and make our hearts right I'm asking God that you search me and you search out my heart and search my thoughts that you know me Lord and that you lead me in the way that's right and I pray God that you'd write your law in My Heart Lord not in my head but in my heart that you put your precepts in my inward parts that you would share your mind with me by your Holy Ghost Lord that I would know in the situations I find myself in what is the right thing to do in every circumstance and in every situation God may I be led by your spirit even when I don't know may your spirit Lead Me Lord in the way of everlasting life that I might be found pleasing you and at the end of the day Lord may may my heart be pure before you Lord help us to come to the end of the Commandment to serve you Lord with love from a perfect heart and a good conscience and perfect Faith Lord I pray you bless your people help us to go from here and God help us to be real Christians genuine from the core of us all the way through sincere and loving and putting you first and everything help us to be real God I pray that you'd Shine the Light of your gospel in our heart Lord that we might see those areas we need to repent of and stay away from help us to be genuine and real almighty God I love you Lord I ask that you would bless us as we part and guide us through life we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen like oh I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the wholey consuming fire all my works and all my Deeds every prayer set on my knees will lay me before a
