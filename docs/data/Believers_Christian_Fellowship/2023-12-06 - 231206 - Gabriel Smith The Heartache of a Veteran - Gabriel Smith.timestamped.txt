[12:31] 2 uh Luke Chapter 2 uh verse
[12:37] 21 and
[12:46] uh and I I'd like to speak to you this
[12:50] evening uh on um just a little thought
[12:54] on the heartache of a
[12:57] veteran um
[13:00] Luke 2 and verse
[13:04] 21 and when eight days were accomplished
[13:07] for the circumcision of the
[13:10] child his name was called Jesus which
[13:14] was so
[13:15] named of the Angel before he was
[13:19] conceived in the womb and when the days
[13:22] of her purification according to the law
[13:24] of Moses were
[13:25] accomplished they brought him to
[13:27] Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as
[13:31] it was written in the law of the Lord
[13:33] every male that openeth the womb shall
[13:36] be caught holy to the Lord and to offer
[13:40] a sacrifice according to that which is
[13:42] said in the law of the Lord a pair of
[13:46] turtle doves or two young
[13:49] pigeons and behold there was a man in
[13:53] Jerusalem whose name was
[13:55] Simeon and the same man was just and
[13:58] devout out waiting for the consolation
[14:01] of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[14:04] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[14:07] holy ghost that he should not see death
[14:11] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[14:14] he came in by the spirit into the temple
[14:17] and when the parents brought in the
[14:20] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[14:23] custom of the law they took him he him
[14:28] up in his own arms and blessed God and
[14:31] said Lord now let us thy servant depart
[14:35] in peace according to Thy
[14:38] word for my eyes have seen thy salvation
[14:42] which thou has pre prepared before the
[14:44] face of all the people a light to
[14:48] lighten the Gentiles and the glory of
[14:51] thy People
[14:53] Israel let's just bow our heads in word
[14:55] of
[14:57] Prayer
[14:59] precious
[15:01] Lord so thankful to be able to gather
[15:06] here this evening and in the world in
[15:10] chaos
[15:12] and know where to turn and confusion on
[15:16] every hand we're so thankful Lord that
[15:19] you've gave given us a
[15:22] refuge in a time of need and Lord
[15:27] we're truly unworthy to stand here
[15:32] before the purchase of your
[15:35] blood
[15:37] and uh just pray Lord that you would
[15:40] have your way as only you can in this
[15:43] service you you know the needs of my
[15:46] brothers and
[15:47] sisters and Lord I I've did all that I
[15:51] know how to do to try to find your mind
[15:55] for this evening and so we just want to
[15:59] yield to you Lord and let you say what
[16:05] want what needs to be
[16:06] said God that I I I would
[16:10] have um the courage to say what you want
[16:14] said and the wisdom to say not what
[16:18] needs to be said and so we surrender
[16:21] Lord ourselves to you and I pray that we
[16:24] could enter in Lord and and pray pray
[16:28] that you would just
[16:30] have full sway Lord to deal with our
[16:33] hearts including mine that we could all
[16:35] be modable Lord and
[16:37] teachable this evening Lord that it
[16:40] would be a teachable moment for all of
[16:42] us for that's what we came here to do is
[16:46] to learn of you so we look into your
[16:49] Eternal Word tonight and ask your
[16:51] blessings to be upon it and we ask these
[16:54] things to be so in the name that's above
[16:57] every name
[16:59] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[17:03] God bless you be seated if you
[17:09] like um the the heartache of a
[17:13] veteran and you know uh thinking about
[17:20] Simeon
[17:22] um I guess I just not realized this
[17:24] December so I wouldn't even maybe it's a
[17:27] little Christmas message I don't know I
[17:30] I didn't I
[17:32] didn't I didn't uh I didn't realize it
[17:36] was December so uh but um you know um
[17:42] you think of Simeon and um as it was at
[17:48] the first coming we know that it's going
[17:50] to be that same uh scenario right now
[17:56] and there wasn't but just a handful of
[17:58] of Believers that was uh waiting uh uh
[18:03] for the Messiah the anointed one and
[18:07] when he came he came in such a strange
[18:10] way that uh the multitudes missed him
[18:14] and you know you you think of Simeon he
[18:17] was a devout man a just man faithful at
[18:21] his post of Duty he had he had fought a
[18:24] good fight he had finished his course
[18:27] and it was the very climax of his
[18:30] ministry and you know if you would look
[18:33] at him uh from um maybe a bystander
[18:38] perspective um the prophet tells us that
[18:41] everybody mocked
[18:42] him um they thought he was off in his
[18:45] head you know he was getting old and and
[18:48] you know the scile was creeping in you
[18:52] know and um but there wasn't cile
[18:56] creeping in and and he wasn't n uh some
[18:59] uh old man that was off at his head a
[19:02] little bit but he was elect of God that
[19:06] was in the channel of God and and was
[19:09] ordained to see the Son of God and even
[19:13] though uh he may have looked strange to
[19:16] everybody else uh I you know I I I kind
[19:21] of felt sorry for him to to think of the
[19:23] heartache that that veteran uh had went
[19:27] through you know he was faithful uh for
[19:30] years upon years and when he comes to
[19:33] the very climax of it and and it's the
[19:36] fulfill and you know that's that's how a
[19:37] lot of times how it happens to us when
[19:39] we actually come to our position we look
[19:42] crazy to the world and and people think
[19:45] we're off and we it don't make no sense
[19:48] but but whenever God shows us something
[19:50] it don't matter what the world thanks
[19:53] and you know the heartache that that man
[19:56] had to carry uh I I know it no doubt had
[19:59] to be great um for for the things that
[20:03] the prophet of God gave us insight into
[20:05] in his life and you know uh but but I I
[20:09] I I think of another uh group of of
[20:12] veterans you know uh cuz I I I got to be
[20:17] honest with you you know when we we go
[20:19] through life um my
[20:23] um you know you know you always take
[20:25] inventory of your life and you sometimes
[20:27] you want wonder why do I tick the way
[20:31] that I tick right and um I U my you know
[20:37] um I think it's always good that you
[20:40] kind of uh take inventory of your life
[20:42] and uh that's that's way I don't know I
[20:44] don't know how y'all do it uh but how I
[20:47] do it I I like to analyze myself and why
[20:50] why do I why do I do the things that I
[20:52] do and why do I act why do I my why do
[20:55] my thought process tesses are the way
[20:57] that they are and you know um I I think
[21:01] sometimes in life uh um we have um
[21:05] circumstances in life that happens to us
[21:07] and it it molds us a certain way it
[21:10] makes us a certain way and um you know I
[21:14] ain't uh hesitate saying this I hope you
[21:17] understand I A A ain't trying to uh cry
[21:20] on nobody's shoulders but you know when
[21:21] you when you come from a broken home and
[21:23] you don't have a a father figure uh in
[21:26] your life on a regular basis uh it it
[21:29] puts a gap there and when you when you
[21:33] you young ones you you uh ought to be
[21:37] ashamed of yourself if you're critical
[21:39] on Mom and Dad because they make a
[21:41] little mistake here and there because
[21:43] it's the it's the it's a what a blessing
[21:45] it is to have Mom and Dad in the
[21:47] household no no matter how hard that
[21:50] maybe sometimes you may think they are
[21:52] you know but uh no matter how bad you
[21:54] may think you have it people got a whole
[21:56] lot worse and uh some of you been you
[22:01] know born with a silver messy spoon in
[22:03] your mouth
[22:05] and yeah y'all ain't got a clue what
[22:07] ruggedness is but but you know but you
[22:11] sometimes you got to step back a little
[22:13] bit and count your blessings you know
[22:14] cuz as young people you can look at Mom
[22:17] and Dad and you know you you can look so
[22:20] much at their bad parts that you never
[22:22] you never acknowledge their good
[22:26] parts and uh you know uh brother
[22:29] brandham taught us that uh parents will
[22:32] live uh their best and their worst at
[22:35] home and as as young people you got to
[22:39] be mindful of that but uh you also have
[22:41] to make a a choice on your own self that
[22:44] I'm not going to focus on just the bad
[22:46] but I'm also going to look at the good
[22:48] and and uh but you know uh and I'm I'm
[22:51] not here to I don't even want to try to
[22:53] shine a light on my family in a negative
[22:56] way but growing up in a broken home you
[22:59] know um you you you go through life and
[23:03] and there's that void because you don't
[23:05] have that father figure on a daily basis
[23:08] you don't you don't have that rock every
[23:10] night that you can look to and and when
[23:12] you lay your head on your pillow you
[23:14] know he's in the Next Room or you know
[23:16] he's coming home soon or you know what I
[23:19] mean and and you can you can let that
[23:22] become common to you and you can you can
[23:25] not give it the credit or the or the
[23:27] attention that it's due but but if you
[23:29] do have that you're a blessed young
[23:32] person uh tonight and and to grow up
[23:34] with a with a mom and dad and all their
[23:36] mistakes they still are are are striving
[23:40] uh to serve the Lord and and when they
[23:43] make a mistake they they repent yes
[23:48] amen
[23:50] yes now brother Emanuel I appreciate the
[23:53] amens but he ain't got the amen for all
[23:55] of yous now yep
[23:58] amen thank you
[24:01] yes and you know
[24:05] but because of the lack of that type of
[24:08] leadership in in my life I I've always
[24:12] um I've always had a weakness there for
[24:17] elders uh in the sense of I you know uh
[24:21] that I think that's one of the reasons
[24:22] why I love the prophet so much is
[24:24] because he was he was such a such a a
[24:28] rock he always Dependable you know what
[24:31] I mean never was no change in him and
[24:35] and I don't know if you've ever there's
[24:38] a um there's a um a tape recording of
[24:41] him um um around a kitchen table um and
[24:47] um it's not a you'd have to go on like
[24:50] YouTube or and you'd um I think it's
[24:53] something like a conversation with banks
[24:55] Woods or something like that but anyway
[24:57] anyways it's on it's online but if if
[25:00] You' listened to that the the amazing
[25:03] thing to me is that when he's that
[25:07] prophet of God Malachi 4 when he's
[25:10] sitting around that kitchen table and
[25:12] sister Woods is is correcting
[25:15] him and uh you know she's like tell them
[25:19] this tell him and uh Malachi 4 you know
[25:22] he's like oh yeah and uh but the amazing
[25:26] thing is is it to me is when when when
[25:30] he's when he's talking and just having a
[25:32] little bible sty talking about the
[25:33] things of the Lord that when when he's
[25:36] there if if you didn't know that he was
[25:39] at a kitchen
[25:40] table if if I if I took that and and and
[25:44] switched it with another tape when he
[25:46] was in you know in shreport or or or if
[25:49] he's at Jeffersonville or wherever it
[25:51] was I you could take that same you know
[25:54] they take that same man and and he
[25:58] didn't preach any different whether he
[25:59] was around the kitchen table or
[26:01] preaching to half a million Souls it it
[26:04] he he he was he was solid he was firm
[26:07] and and you know that they the thing I
[26:10] loved about him is there wasn't no you
[26:12] know was no preacher voice that came out
[26:15] you know I mean it wasn't no no polish
[26:17] he was just and what I what I and you
[26:19] know I was thinking about this just in
[26:21] the back room there that you know
[26:23] brother Brandon would always say I don't
[26:24] have a personality anybody ever hear him
[26:27] say that and I always wondered we don't
[26:28] have no personality but it just struck
[26:31] me back there that when I was coming up
[26:33] here it's like the reason why he would
[26:36] say that is because as Ministry we can
[26:39] project a personality and not the Holy
[26:43] Spirit
[26:47] right and and and and
[26:49] unfortunately um in in in in amongst our
[26:53] ranks is is you have that uh I didn't
[26:57] want to start there but you understand
[26:59] what I'm saying the point is is we're
[27:01] not here to project a personality we
[27:04] we're here to surrender to the holy
[27:05] spirit that that the Holy Spirit can
[27:08] project Divine love to his people and
[27:11] and and to me that's what what what I
[27:14] love about that Prophet is because he
[27:16] was he was so he is so real and when he
[27:20] speaks it's it's a level of
[27:22] sincerity that um you you you it's it's
[27:27] a it's a rare thing and and uh oh I want
[27:32] to be I want to be that sincere
[27:36] someday and and and that's what I'm I'm
[27:39] striving for every day of my life is to
[27:41] die out more so that so that more of
[27:45] that Holy Spirit sincerity can shine
[27:47] through in my life and you know and and
[27:51] so I I I for me I'm I'm I'm kind of I'm
[27:57] kind of
[27:58] um um partial I'm sorry for you ones
[28:02] that's like 30
[28:04] 40 I'm not too partial to you you just
[28:08] but you know you give me one of them
[28:10] brothers that that's got about 60 65 70
[28:14] 80 years old and and them are the ones
[28:18] that I love I love to snuggle up
[28:25] to because the thing of it is is you can
[28:27] learn something see I my whole life I
[28:31] I'm um I'm I'm I want wisdom and I want
[28:35] to understand and I and I want to I want
[28:37] to live the right kind of life and and
[28:40] the thing of it is is I as I see elders
[28:42] and when I see that little gleam in
[28:44] their eyes it it's like it's something
[28:47] just it it just something clicks and I
[28:49] say that's the one and and then and then
[28:53] when when an opportunity arrives
[28:56] I
[29:02] I hope you young people right y'all need
[29:04] to be taking I don't see no pens moving
[29:06] I need to be taking some notes on
[29:09] that because the problem of it is is
[29:11] when we think we got it all figured out
[29:13] that's when we know we
[29:17] wrong and unfortunately our elders don't
[29:21] get the attention that they are
[29:23] deserving and if we would apply that
[29:28] we would get more of life and it would
[29:29] help us to bypass all the problems that
[29:31] we run into but but the thing of it is
[29:34] is we have such a pride that that we
[29:37] think we got it all figured out but the
[29:39] key to it all is to humble yourself and
[29:41] ask
[29:42] questions the only way you're going to
[29:44] learn is to ask questions and and and to
[29:47] be able to to to have a uh a
[29:50] vulnerability and really whenever you
[29:52] tap into that vulnerability it's really
[29:55] a strength because when you you see
[29:57] somebody that puts up a facade on on
[30:00] that beyond that facade they're
[30:06] afraid but but if you meet somebody
[30:08] that'll open themselves up and be honest
[30:10] and transparent it shows that they're
[30:13] secure in who they really
[30:18] are and and and if and and the thing of
[30:21] it is I I I I see a lot of times as
[30:23] people go through years of that per of
[30:26] of that of that
[30:28] um that that facade that that they miss
[30:32] so many opportunities in growing in the
[30:36] Lord and and you know whether it be
[30:38] preacher or you know whoever I mean the
[30:41] thing of it is is we got to have
[30:43] humility in this thing called life
[30:45] there's there's you know you know
[30:48] brother Brenham talked about uh uh them
[30:50] old oak
[30:52] trees and you know when uh but Tommy
[30:55] Osborne come to him and you you know
[30:57] brother brandom had had performed that
[30:59] Miracle on that maniac and that man fell
[31:02] at his feet and and and you know after
[31:05] that brother Tommy came to brother
[31:07] brandom said brother brandom do do you
[31:09] think I got a gift of
[31:11] healing and uh he said old Tomy he said
[31:14] listen if you're called to be a preacher
[31:16] you have the a gift of of healing and
[31:19] then he said and he and he took it a
[31:21] step further he said every believer has
[31:23] that ability to pray and receive healing
[31:26] anden
[31:29] see and and uh he he he he told he told
[31:33] Brother Tommy said look Tommy he said
[31:35] you see that old oak tree over there
[31:37] sitting
[31:38] down and he he was looking at uh I think
[31:42] it was brother FF Bosworth if I ain't
[31:45] mistaken and uh and he said why don't
[31:48] you go sit under him for a year year and
[31:50] a
[31:52] half you know and then and he he
[31:55] listened to that prophet and and when he
[31:58] did that there was fruit from his
[32:00] ministry after that but but he had to
[32:02] have the ability to Humble themselves
[32:05] you know and and I think sometimes
[32:07] Brethren sisters we have we have the
[32:10] message you know in every form possible
[32:14] whether it be iPad phone
[32:18] computer you know uh I'm sure if you got
[32:20] a smart watching somehow get it on there
[32:22] and but but you know you'll never have
[32:25] the wisdom to to to hit the right
[32:28] keystrokes if you have the wrong
[32:33] attitude and and it takes a level of
[32:36] humility to to say I'm not going to
[32:39] study it
[32:42] out I'm going to pray it
[32:45] out and you know you know something that
[32:48] I'm I'm I'm coming into in my life and I
[32:52] know this is a different service but I
[32:53] can't help but just to be who I am and
[32:56] how I'm feeling but uh you know
[32:59] something that I've I I've come
[33:02] to I I I really felt like you know the
[33:05] past I don't know short while I I've
[33:08] really tapped into this uh like a like a
[33:13] just a burden for for
[33:16] um just for
[33:20] prayer
[33:22] um and and uh cuz I think I think so
[33:26] many times you know know even as a
[33:27] minister what I found in my own self
[33:29] because you have a gift you see things
[33:33] in the message that others don't
[33:35] see and and just out of a god-given gift
[33:39] you have the ability to compile and it
[33:42] be
[33:44] good but but I I wonder and I I won't
[33:49] Wonder no I I say in my ownself I I have
[33:52] a question if I didn't if I didn't set
[33:54] the Holy Spirit aside sometime
[34:00] times because it's so easy for us to
[34:03] lean on our
[34:04] intellect and and it's so easy for us to
[34:07] lean on a gift being our
[34:11] own and and and and let me say this it
[34:15] it's also easy for for us to be in the
[34:18] comfort of our own home and lean upon
[34:22] you know the prophet and not lean upon
[34:25] the gifts in the body
[34:28] amen see it's it's a Razor's Edge in on
[34:32] all of this the and and to me that's why
[34:35] I feel more and
[34:37] more um like a like a like a
[34:40] burning
[34:43] uh um
[34:45] urgency to to to to be mindful of how
[34:50] razor sharp edge it is because when you
[34:53] look amongst our own ranks there's
[34:55] there's so many facets to it
[34:57] and you wonder well which one is the
[34:59] right
[35:02] facet you know and and to me friends
[35:06] ultimately you you have to you have to
[35:09] fight it out on your
[35:12] own and and you have to take it serious
[35:16] look because here's the thing it's not
[35:18] about us just being cleaned up there's
[35:21] going to be millions that are cleaned up
[35:24] that miss it and are going to be left
[35:25] behind and and got and got you know the
[35:28] table app on their FR on their phone but
[35:32] you know and and and got no doubt uh a
[35:35] Bible app and a and a audio Bible app
[35:38] and they you know they got the our daily
[35:40] bread and you know all these devotionals
[35:43] and but but you know all of those don't
[35:45] do no good what what I really want to
[35:48] what I really want to see is let me get
[35:51] into your
[35:53] settings
[35:55] amen yes that's what I want to
[35:58] see Let Let me let now don't don't erase
[36:01] your history either now hold on now
[36:04] don't erase your history I I want to see
[36:06] your
[36:07] settings and I want to I want to look at
[36:10] I want to look at your time
[36:12] frame and I want to see I want to see
[36:15] your your your table app time span
[36:20] versus your
[36:24] Facebook I I want I
[36:30] hey hey you say brother Gabe listen I'm
[36:32] not sitting in the seat of the scornful
[36:34] I was
[36:43] guilty you know you know we can we we
[36:46] can here's the thing and and this is
[36:48] this is a scary part ain't going to be
[36:50] no alcohol
[36:52] involved ain't going to be no
[36:55] drugs see
[36:57] but but the thing of it is is where is
[36:59] it taking
[37:03] you and and that's where we have to be
[37:06] honest with
[37:07] ourselves where are we at friends listen
[37:12] when when
[37:16] when when we come to the spot we have to
[37:19] be honest and ask ourselves what trees
[37:23] are we sitting
[37:25] under right
[37:31] I mean is it is it the tree of knowledge
[37:32] of good and evil or is it the tree of
[37:37] life because that choice is set before
[37:40] us every day of our life which one of we
[37:42] going to sit under I want to sit under
[37:45] the tree of life and and in order to do
[37:49] that that's the harder
[37:51] choice and and even you know even
[37:55] talking you know I was so nerv nervous
[37:56] about this thought I I'll be honest with
[37:58] you brother brother Bob I was I know you
[38:00] you was away on vacation I was thinking
[38:03] oh I hope he's here tonight I so happy
[38:05] to see you brother he been on my heart
[38:07] and I you know I was talking to the Lord
[38:09] I said Lord I said brother Bob he ought
[38:12] to preach uh he he's definitely more uh
[38:15] qualified to take a title like that the
[38:18] heartache of a veteran and who am i i a
[38:21] i a you know uh and but but the thing of
[38:25] it is is you know to me when you can see
[38:28] and I'm not just talking about brother
[38:29] Bob there's lots of you and I I won't
[38:30] call your names out cuz I know some of
[38:32] you don't like being called out so I
[38:34] won't say who it is but listen to me as
[38:38] as a youngster when I can walk up to you
[38:40] and I and I can see that you've been
[38:43] down a few roads in your life but
[38:45] there's still a sweetness about you
[38:48] there's still a tenderness about you you
[38:50] know the other day when brother Chad was
[38:52] preaching I I I you know uh I I was I
[38:56] was so Soul he was preaching on you know
[38:58] uh repentance and and uh man I I just
[39:01] had to get to the Altar and you know
[39:03] when I was praying asking the Lord
[39:05] crying out to him searching my life
[39:07] overturning every Rock You know I
[39:09] couldn't help but the he on this ear
[39:11] over here her brother Bob praying right
[39:14] beside me I said oh
[39:17] my hey to me that you know what I mean
[39:21] that's that's a that's the heartache of
[39:23] a
[39:24] veteran you know he ain't saying oh I'm
[39:27] too old to go to the
[39:30] altar prise God come on friends but you
[39:33] know what happens you know why we don't
[39:35] go to the altar cuz we're worried about
[39:37] what everybody else is going to
[39:41] think well brother Gabe I don't want to
[39:43] look like a sinner
[39:45] well oh you praise the lord well let me
[39:49] ask you something let me ask you
[39:52] something did did you go a whole three
[39:55] days without sentence since the last
[39:57] service I
[39:59] mean man I mean uh if you did uh I'm
[40:04] sure brother Chad ain't going to mind
[40:06] you come on up here and give us your
[40:07] secret recipe cuz I
[40:09] mean
[40:13] I you you you see what I'm saying
[40:15] friends but the thing of it is is
[40:17] because we we we get these things in our
[40:20] mind and and we we have this we have
[40:24] this image that we want to protect
[40:27] and right there we miss our opportunity
[40:29] because what if what if what if what if
[40:33] brother Gabe needed your hands laid on
[40:36] what what if what if what if it it had
[40:38] to be brother Les and
[40:43] you amen cuz he was the one up there
[40:47] laying hands on me praying for
[40:49] me you understand what I'm saying friend
[40:51] the thing of it is what what I'm what I
[40:53] want what I'm trying to get to what's on
[40:55] my heart
[40:58] is we got to to me I'm searching out my
[41:02] heart in so many areas overturning
[41:05] everything and you know what is so
[41:07] beautiful is when you overturn
[41:09] everything and it's peace
[41:14] amen you know when when you overturn
[41:17] every Rock and you just see God's
[41:20] delivering hand on it and and and you
[41:23] know uh for so many years I turn over a
[41:26] rock and it was like
[41:28] man oh man come
[41:36] on but and I'm sure there's going to be
[41:39] a rock turned up tomorrow now that I
[41:41] said that you
[41:44] know but that's okay because the thing
[41:46] of it is is the grace of God is going to
[41:49] be there to help me through that
[41:50] whatever that thing is and the whole
[41:53] point is it's
[41:54] relationship it's relationship ship with
[41:57] the Lord Jesus and I'm I'm finding I'm
[42:00] finding a closeness to him like like I I
[42:03] don't even know how to explain it I mean
[42:05] to me it's just like
[42:06] Lord I don't know I
[42:09] I I I don't even I try not to be
[42:13] spiritual and they like seven seal with
[42:15] just silence you know you you don't have
[42:17] words you know you don't have words to
[42:19] say you know what I mean the other day
[42:22] other day uh Ser was so
[42:24] powerful uh it was like four times in
[42:27] service I I I started like in my mind
[42:30] it's like I want to speak in tongues and
[42:31] I was just like I had to bite it down
[42:33] you know because I didn't have I didn't
[42:35] have a I didn't have a way to praise him
[42:38] I didn't have that language that I
[42:40] wanted you understand what I'm
[42:43] saying oh man you know this makes me
[42:45] feel weird cuz I'm just talking to you
[42:46] this is just this ain't much preaching
[42:48] this is just is this okay y y okay but
[42:52] the thing to me friends is look it God
[42:55] is real amen he is so real and and to me
[42:59] it's just like like it's that Roman
[43:01] candles going off in so many facets that
[43:03] it to me it's overwhelming
[43:13] sometimes I feel sorry for
[43:17] [Laughter]
[43:19] Joshua cuz I'm I'm trying to hold it you
[43:23] know I got I got I got some I got a
[43:26] little bit of voice to me if y'all
[43:27] didn't
[43:28] know and I feel sorry for him because
[43:31] he's right right in front of me so I try
[43:33] to direct it and then is then brother
[43:34] John's like yeah thanks brother Gabe I
[43:36] appreciate
[43:40] it keep it in the family
[43:44] brother I just I just uh to
[43:48] me here's the thing and I know you know
[43:51] you think about this I feel like
[43:52] nowadays like I'm some season like I've
[43:55] been preaching for years years and I
[43:56] look at I ain't been here but a handful
[43:58] of times but it just feels so real to me
[44:00] but I I get up here and you know brother
[44:04] B says when you get up there if you
[44:05] don't have nothing else just tell them
[44:06] how the candle got lit you know that's
[44:09] where I'm at friends and I can't help it
[44:11] I got 96
[44:18] slides I told I told Brother Franco I
[44:21] showed him I showed him one he was like
[44:23] oh man I never seen and and uh uh I I I
[44:27] told him I said well brother we probably
[44:28] ain't going to get to that so here
[44:29] brother Franco look brother Franco let's
[44:34] uh this one is
[44:36] uh brother Franco can you go to
[44:41] 87 brother 87 look he got a scroll of
[44:44] waves 87
[44:47] brother he's talking about this in the
[44:50] back now you want to think about you
[44:52] know we we talk about how how powerful
[44:56] the Bible is but God in five in in
[45:01] five you know words or something you
[45:04] understand what I'm saying but in in the
[45:06] first sentence of the Bible God would
[45:08] say in the beginning God created the
[45:11] heavens and the Earth
[45:13] period but God is so
[45:15] beautiful that scientists wouldn't tap
[45:18] into this till hundreds of years later
[45:22] and they would say that there's five
[45:24] elements that make up what we live in
[45:27] and that's Time Force energy space and
[45:33] matter those are the things that that
[45:35] that that make our
[45:38] world and yet we know it's not force but
[45:41] it's God but that's what science says
[45:44] but but you think about how how God is
[45:47] so mindful that he can he can he can he
[45:50] can make a a language in the first few
[45:55] or the first sentence that's ever
[45:56] expressed would Express what we live
[46:00] in I mean I mean you
[46:04] know you know but the thing of it is the
[46:06] problem of it is friends is we let these
[46:08] things become common to us and we go oh
[46:12] man brother Chad he's reading Genesis
[46:24] again
[46:27] you know you know there's uh brother
[46:30] brother brandom in
[46:32] 1964 um I got a slide but I don't know
[46:36] where it's at it's probably like 70 or
[46:37] 80
[46:39] but in 1964 he preaches a message and
[46:43] the sub and the and the the the
[46:45] scripture that he uses is a greater than
[46:47] Solomon is here the Queen of
[46:50] Sheba and and when he when he says that
[46:54] he he says um that his is uh he um oh
[46:57] man let's see
[46:59] here brother
[47:03] Franco 75 brother
[47:06] 75 Teamwork Makes the Dream
[47:12] Work what
[47:15] now watch what brother Bram says now
[47:18] this is
[47:20] 1964 brother brandham is at the end of
[47:22] his
[47:23] ministry and he reads a
[47:27] scripture that that he has he has
[47:36] um he has mentioned the Queen of Sheba
[47:40] 124 times on
[47:43] tape he's preached it 13
[47:46] times that we have
[47:49] recorded brother Brenham said 150 times
[47:53] on tape a greater than Solomon is is
[47:56] here and 12 times he preached the
[47:58] greater than Solomon is here and at the
[48:02] end of that prophets
[48:04] Road and he would read a scripture that
[48:08] he has read Around the
[48:10] World time and time
[48:15] again but when he
[48:18] prays watch what his first sentence
[48:24] is Lord
[48:26] Jesus as we read these stories of the
[48:30] Bible our hearts jump for
[48:38] joy see where look
[48:43] what what is all our files going to do
[48:46] on our
[48:52] computer friends if we don't have that
[48:57] if we don't have that we missed
[49:01] it we missed it friends we are leaning
[49:06] on our intellect and we're leaning on
[49:09] what we can compile and how well we can
[49:13] see it and we're missing the essence of
[49:17] eternal life the very essence of eternal
[49:20] life that Prophet is showing us that at
[49:23] the end of his ministry he would say oh
[49:26] I've I've used that scripture too
[49:30] much
[49:31] you okay we got some can I get a
[49:34] preacher here say Amen if they ever well
[49:36] I used that that I used that scripture
[49:39] three weeks ago I I can't preach that
[49:41] subject
[49:49] again oh brother boy y'all brothers man
[49:53] come on up there man I
[49:57] see the thing of it is is because we
[50:00] think oh well they already know that I
[50:01] can't but but the thing of it is Friends
[50:03] brother brandham is showing us something
[50:06] in that he's Malachi 4 but he takes
[50:10] something like that and he ain't got no
[50:12] artificial put on but when he reads that
[50:15] thing after this is 64 after what 50
[50:18] years 40 years well however many years
[50:20] it's been uh he started preaching at
[50:22] what 33 I mean you I mean me it's 30
[50:26] some odd years of of laboring in this
[50:29] and when he when he reads it the first
[50:31] thing that comes out of his heart to the
[50:34] Lord is my heart
[50:37] jumps for
[50:40] Joy am
[50:44] yes to me that's that that's that's
[50:47] that's what I
[50:49] want I I I want that and if it doesn't
[50:53] see this is this is where I'm coming to
[50:56] that that that if it doesn't then what I
[50:59] do is I close the Bible and I go
[51:04] pray cuz studying don't
[51:08] matter and and the thing of it is
[51:10] friends is that's when we can lean on
[51:11] our
[51:12] intellect the the whole point is we have
[51:15] to we have to we have and listen it is
[51:18] not easy because it takes Faith to
[51:21] believe that God hears your prayer amen
[51:23] and and that's the problem we are afraid
[51:26] that God isn't hearing our prayer so we
[51:29] don't want to go in prayer and be
[51:33] disappointed oh come on friends please
[51:35] somebody say Amen y'all know what I'm
[51:38] talking about friends because of because
[51:42] of of whatever busyness and hustle and
[51:44] bustle and all these different things we
[51:47] live in a neurotic world and you I none
[51:50] of us are immune from it not a one of us
[51:54] is but the the thing of it is is we have
[51:56] to be able to be honest with ourselves
[51:59] and say God this world is pulling me
[52:02] this way but I want to go that
[52:06] way that's where I'm at friends and I I
[52:09] I and and to me I I'll be honest with
[52:12] you this I have I'm listening to myself
[52:15] and it's like Lord what am I doing but
[52:17] to me this is freedom to me this is
[52:20] Liberty to be able to to to to actually
[52:24] be a real
[52:27] Christian like like you understand what
[52:29] I'm saying friends like when you know
[52:31] you know you know whenever you can you
[52:33] know a lot of times you I don't know if
[52:35] all of
[52:36] you um I I'll just be honest with you
[52:40] you know uh I come out of Great
[52:44] Tribulation that's the only thing I can
[52:47] say
[52:49] um you know
[52:53] um I spit I spent a
[52:58] um I spent
[53:00] a um a lot of
[53:04] years T up
[53:07] struggling um when you when you go
[53:12] through
[53:13] life
[53:16] um sometimes sometimes life is is um so
[53:20] confusing to you that's right and you
[53:24] try trying to find the purpose of it and
[53:27] you think you got the purpose figured
[53:29] out and it thow throws you a
[53:32] curveball and then you go well now what
[53:34] do I
[53:37] do and you know
[53:42] um you know I I I I look at the young
[53:45] people and they got they got so much
[53:47] potential and to me it's like I want to
[53:49] do everything I can to to help them to
[53:53] achieve their potential
[53:56] because there's so many people that want
[53:57] to tear you down and destroy you because
[53:59] they don't want to see anybody be an
[54:01] overcomer cuz it's going to bring
[54:03] condemnation to them you know and and
[54:07] and you look at you look at you look at
[54:10] children that that that y'all don't
[54:13] realize um the Wows that the enemy tries
[54:16] to put on You by making the world seem
[54:19] so uh much greater than a Christian walk
[54:22] but if you could if you could I wish you
[54:24] could step into my heart and and and and
[54:27] go back through through the alleys and
[54:30] and and the pitfalls and the and the in
[54:33] the corruption and perversion just to
[54:36] catch a glimpse and and then and then
[54:40] set in the service and feel the presence
[54:42] of God and it would it would take every
[54:44] bit of that wonder and question out of
[54:46] you but I but I can't do it but but oh
[54:49] how I would love to do I would I'd give
[54:52] anything to to to be able to do that
[54:54] because you young people have such a a
[54:57] blessed uh uh uh uh hope before you but
[55:02] but you got to realize the potential
[55:04] that's there and and and then you got to
[55:06] hold it and be mindful and and
[55:09] unfortunately some of you ain't going to
[55:11] catch it and then you're going to have
[55:12] to have a old veteran put his arm around
[55:15] you and go yeah I know I did that
[55:17] too yeah messed up
[55:20] too and it'll be an honest veteran
[55:22] that'll come to you and go yeah yeah
[55:26] know but the problem of it is if you got
[55:28] polish and and Persona you you won't
[55:31] humble yourself and say it but but to me
[55:34] friends the you you know you know what
[55:37] what I what I love I I can talk about my
[55:40] past because my past is not my present
[55:43] and that's the beauty of it like I've
[55:45] been delivered and and so to me I don't
[55:48] I don't have that shame I'm ashamed of
[55:51] it but but all it is is a testimony of
[55:54] God's over overcoming
[55:56] power and and and the thing of it is no
[55:58] matter what Pitfall you fell into look
[56:02] there there it ain't nothing that that's
[56:04] uh uncommon everyone of every human
[56:07] being has F has fallen in some way shape
[56:09] or
[56:11] form but but the thing of it is is is is
[56:16] is we're so ashamed of that that we
[56:19] don't want to relate to it but but a lot
[56:22] of times we miss the opportunity to help
[56:25] a
[56:27] youngster
[56:29] amise God be be
[56:35] because it's not
[56:38] easy but if it was easy everybody be a
[56:43] Christian that's right but but it it it
[56:47] takes
[56:50] honesty it takes
[56:52] sincerity
[56:53] amen it takes time and
[56:58] effort it it takes
[57:01] years of looking at yourself and hating
[57:04] what you
[57:05] see but yet you keep on going cuz you
[57:08] know it's something
[57:12] real I'm telling you if you can show me
[57:15] something real in this message please
[57:16] show me cuz I ain't I a my little PE
[57:19] brain experience of life it's the most
[57:21] beautiful thing I've ever
[57:23] saw brother die for this thing hey
[57:27] that's right tell me where to
[57:28] go hey uh but you know
[57:35] um in
[57:37] life um in
[57:40] life I would encourage you young people
[57:43] to to be mindful of the oak trees that's
[57:46] around
[57:47] you cuz one day they won't be
[57:53] there right
[57:55] yes amen and you will miss your
[57:58] opportunity to spend some time under
[58:00] that oak tree all the little saplings
[58:03] may be fun but you're never going to get
[58:05] anything from
[58:09] them right but if you can find the old
[58:12] oak tree and cast that
[58:16] reel
[58:18] you get them hooked
[58:20] in you poke them a little bit get them
[58:24] get them talking
[58:26] right and ask a question
[58:29] then you let them go and then start
[58:32] listening and before not they'll start
[58:34] they'll start dropping wisdom on you you
[58:36] be
[58:36] [Music]
[58:44] like but it takes
[58:49] time takes
[58:51] effort and it takes humility cuz you got
[58:54] to set your life aside and go wait a
[58:55] minute I want to prepare for tomorrow
[58:58] and I don't know how to prepare for
[59:00] tomorrow but that person is already been
[59:03] through my
[59:07] tomorrow and so if they've already been
[59:09] through you tomorrow wouldn't it be good

[1:00:25] we can be God's advertisement
[1:00:27] board how do you know that your life
[1:00:30] might not start some young man on the
[1:00:33] gospel some of you older men you old
[1:00:37] women start them young men on the field
[1:00:40] out there to win 10,000 souls to
[1:00:44] Christ it was because that he saw Christ
[1:00:48] in
[1:00:50] you it's you presented it Christ to him
[1:00:55] in the simple power of the
[1:01:01] gospel and you know you know what I'm
[1:01:03] finding more and more you know I I
[1:01:09] uh I spent like two three months
[1:01:12] listening to the seventh
[1:01:14] seal over and over and over that's the
[1:01:16] only message I listened
[1:01:18] to and you
[1:01:20] know I didn't compile a bunch of quotes
[1:01:26] I didn't come up with no seven seal
[1:01:32] book but when it's all said and done it
[1:01:37] to
[1:01:38] me it was like a mirror and I looked at
[1:01:41] myself and I
[1:01:44] saw um it uncovered me in such a way
[1:01:49] that I I I saw how how short I was
[1:01:52] coming up
[1:01:56] and and it and it gave me but it wasn't
[1:01:59] like a fear it wasn't it it was more of
[1:02:02] like a a
[1:02:04] piece like like um like I knew the Lord
[1:02:07] was with me and and and it and it and it
[1:02:10] and it helped me to to understand that
[1:02:14] and maybe this ain't you but a lot of
[1:02:16] times I think I do I want to I want to I
[1:02:19] want to understand the message and I got
[1:02:21] to put it out and I got to get all these
[1:02:22] quotes and
[1:02:26] but I realize I realize that that's
[1:02:28] that's not that's not it you'll never
[1:02:31] understand the Plan of Redemption like
[1:02:35] that it cuz it's hidden and then when
[1:02:38] you see when you and when when you catch
[1:02:42] a glimpse of it and then God starts
[1:02:45] showing you more and
[1:02:47] more I'm I'm I'm I'm coming to a place
[1:02:50] that it's like
[1:02:53] um
[1:02:55] I'm I'm I'm trying to watch my words
[1:02:56] because I don't want to sound preacher I
[1:02:59] don't I'm not trying
[1:03:02] to to me this message just gives you
[1:03:06] rest
[1:03:07] yes amen and and and it and it it it's
[1:03:11] given me like a freedom and and I'm
[1:03:14] talking about the seventh seal the the
[1:03:16] coming of the Lord I'm talking about
[1:03:19] this message the gospel what it was sent
[1:03:21] for what it's what it's loose to us in
[1:03:24] this life last day and it and it and it
[1:03:26] and it it really does give you the power
[1:03:29] to overcome the
[1:03:31] world yes and and and and it's and and
[1:03:35] you don't have to compile you don't have
[1:03:38] to compile nothing it builds
[1:03:43] you and and and the thing of it
[1:03:46] is the what I'm learning to do is just
[1:03:50] to
[1:03:53] relax
[1:03:55] amen and sometimes Enjoy the
[1:04:01] Silence cuz you know you know when I
[1:04:03] come to that Altar and I was I was
[1:04:07] crying out to the Lord it was it was it
[1:04:10] wasn't like the Thunderbolts I was
[1:04:12] shaking and trembling on the inside but
[1:04:14] it was it was it was it was it was I got
[1:04:17] to stop I want to no I don't I
[1:04:20] don't
[1:04:21] um all I'm trying to say friends is God
[1:04:25] gives you a peace when when when when
[1:04:28] you really catch a hold of God it is it
[1:04:32] is the essence of eternal life is so
[1:04:35] precious because you don't have words to
[1:04:37] express it you you you that's why as
[1:04:41] almost like I understand why sometimes
[1:04:43] you feel like you need a Heavenly
[1:04:44] language because you can't explain what
[1:04:48] you're
[1:04:49] feeling there is such a freedom and a
[1:04:52] liberty that that comes with this thing
[1:04:54] called Christ that it's it's
[1:04:58] unexplainable and and and to me it it
[1:05:01] I'm I'm I I I feel bad because I'm just
[1:05:05] I never would have expected this um this
[1:05:09] this service to go this way um but I
[1:05:12] don't know what else to do but just be
[1:05:14] me and so I hope it blesses one the rest
[1:05:16] of you I hope it blessed somebody
[1:05:19] because uh um I I don't know I I I feel
[1:05:23] like I I feel like Gabriel Smith is is
[1:05:26] somebody that's totally new and I don't
[1:05:29] know who he
[1:05:30] is I really don't like like like my
[1:05:34] Ministry like like my my my my life uh

[1:06:08] unfolding himself to me in such a way
[1:06:10] that it's like I sit in that seat back

[1:08:49] pounding his
[1:08:52] chest but you're the one you're the
[1:08:54] Publican off in the corner saying
[1:08:59] Lord you understand what I'm saying for
[1:09:01] that's the whole point there's only one
[1:09:03] righteous there's only
[1:09:06] one and a lot of times we'll we we'll
[1:09:08] we'll
[1:09:10] we'll we'll spend years laboring under
[1:09:15] the load of condemnation in our life
[1:09:17] because of something we did years
[1:09:20] ago
[1:09:22] and for whatever reason we won't let
[1:09:25] ourselves Go free because you can be
[1:09:27] free if you want
[1:09:30] to but the thing of it is a lot of times
[1:09:33] it's not so much the devil that's
[1:09:35] holding you bound it's your own
[1:09:38] mind it's your own
[1:09:40] perception and and I I want to share
[1:09:43] this with
[1:09:45] you um and we'll we'll close on this I
[1:09:49] don't want and
[1:09:50] so some something something I did Rec
[1:09:54] well it's been a while ago I'll say
[1:09:55] recently it's been a while ago that I I
[1:09:59] was struggling with something right
[1:10:04] and it like something clicked on the
[1:10:06] inside of
[1:10:08] me and something said to
[1:10:10] me how would you counsel
[1:10:13] you if you come to you with that
[1:10:22] problem
[1:10:27] and I and I thought about
[1:10:29] it and I
[1:10:32] thought
[1:10:34] H how would I counsel
[1:10:38] me if me came to
[1:10:46] I and sister
[1:10:49] Luan something
[1:10:52] happened
[1:10:55] you know cuz I
[1:10:56] realized that I could have all kind of
[1:11:01] Grace for everybody
[1:11:04] else but I couldn't have Grace for
[1:11:10] myself because I took what I was dealing
[1:11:14] with and I flipped
[1:11:18] it and then I I I thought well wait a
[1:11:20] minute cuz then I started I started
[1:11:22] analyzing
[1:11:25] myself and and and I started counseling
[1:11:30] myself and um and I I asked myself
[1:11:35] well what's your
[1:11:41] problem and
[1:11:47] uh you know as I I started talking to
[1:11:51] myself I realized
[1:11:54] that what had happened in my
[1:11:57] life it wasn't my
[1:12:05] fault what what I had been exposed
[1:12:09] to in my
[1:12:12] childhood at an early
[1:12:15] age it wasn't my
[1:12:22] fault
[1:12:24] I was only 6 years
[1:12:30] old and I looked at that little
[1:12:33] six-year-old
[1:12:35] boy and I had Grace for
[1:12:45] him and I I looked at that little
[1:12:48] six-year-old boy
[1:12:49] and I saw how he grew
[1:12:52] up
[1:12:54] I saw the Innocence that was taken from
[1:12:57] him at an early
[1:13:01] age I saw him laboring under
[1:13:09] the I saw him laboring under the Fallen
[1:13:14] condition of
[1:13:18] man broken
[1:13:22] home no
[1:13:26] instruction no
[1:13:29] guidance I saw that little boy go
[1:13:33] through
[1:13:40] adolesence no family
[1:13:46] devotion
[1:13:50] prayer you know when you look at that
[1:13:52] then I really
[1:13:53] realized well
[1:13:56] yeah how how could I went the right
[1:14:02] way you you and you set children in
[1:14:07] atmospheres of
[1:14:09] unbelief how can you hold him to a
[1:14:11] message
[1:14:13] standard but in in my
[1:14:17] mind I was holding myself to a message
[1:14:21] standard without Mage standard being
[1:14:26] there
[1:14:30] and it it gave me
[1:14:34] um it gave me uh it it unlocked
[1:14:38] something in
[1:14:39] me and I don't know how to explain
[1:14:43] it
[1:14:45] um I I was I was talking to Brother Kyle
[1:14:48] about it the other day and uh he said he
[1:14:50] said brother he said uh I just saw the
[1:14:53] video video on that about a some
[1:14:55] entrepreneur some you know big
[1:14:58] businessman he said uh some famous guy
[1:15:01] and he said yeah he said he said uh he
[1:15:04] was being interviewed and the
[1:15:05] interviewer asked him said uh who who
[1:15:07] mentors
[1:15:09] you and the man said this is going to be
[1:15:12] strange but I
[1:15:16] do and brother car said he said the man
[1:15:19] said that he he he puts a business
[1:15:22] meeting every month with
[1:15:27] himself
[1:15:28] and he he writes down questions and he
[1:15:32] answers
[1:15:33] them now that may seem
[1:15:36] crazy but I promise you it
[1:15:42] works because a lot of times it's our
[1:15:45] perception it's our vantage
[1:15:50] point and a lot of times we got so many
[1:15:53] things things cluttered up that block
[1:15:54] our vantage point that we don't see
[1:15:58] clearly and you have to be honest enough
[1:16:00] with yourself to step
[1:16:05] back and look from a different vantage
[1:16:07] point and I promise you when you look
[1:16:10] you're going to see things that you
[1:16:11] don't
[1:16:13] like but that's the whole point those
[1:16:15] are the things that you have to deal
[1:16:16] with listen friends I
[1:16:19] want we we we can't stay in this
[1:16:21] building forever
[1:16:24] we got to go this world is is falling
[1:16:27] apart look young people you may not have
[1:16:29] a year two I don't know how long you got
[1:16:32] but listen get your focus right if you
[1:16:35] got some if you got some junk on the
[1:16:37] inside look csel
[1:16:40] yourself be honest with yourself look
[1:16:44] you know what and it's okay to to go to
[1:16:47] Mom and Dad and go hey I'm
[1:16:50] struggling yes
[1:16:54] cuz a lot of times we put this pressure
[1:16:56] you got look you you you got a big youth
[1:16:59] youth group you know 5060
[1:17:03] strong but sometimes it can be so strong
[1:17:06] that a weak one is like oh
[1:17:09] man but listen them 50 60 strong is
[1:17:13] dealing with the same problems you
[1:17:14] dealing
[1:17:18] with
[1:17:20] yeah you know I I spent
[1:17:23] years
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] years I'm just going to say it you know
[1:17:33] when uh when the Lord brought me
[1:17:35] back and
[1:17:38] uh and I came to this
[1:17:41] church and God started pouring out his
[1:17:43] blessings I told the Lord I said Lord
[1:17:45] I'll be a fool for
[1:17:48] you and I'm in it with every every fiber
[1:17:52] of my
[1:17:53] being I'll be a fool for you
[1:17:56] Lord and makes me nervous that camera
[1:17:59] but I I don't you know not that I don't
[1:18:01] care but I just don't want to be taken
[1:18:03] wrong you know what I mean still got
[1:18:05] that
[1:18:08] projection just as a joy it's just there
[1:18:11] human
[1:18:13] beings but you
[1:18:15] know
[1:18:18] um I'm just I I'm just going to get real
[1:18:21] with you you know I I I told I I said
[1:18:25] said to the Lord I said Lord I said you
[1:18:27] know
[1:18:28] I coming back it was like Lord I I want
[1:18:31] to I want to use every every opportunity
[1:18:34] that I have to make sure that I'm right
[1:18:37] and I I said Lord I said if I'm having
[1:18:39] problems if I'm having problem with
[1:18:41] something I can't overcome something I
[1:18:43] said I'm going straight to brother
[1:18:48] Chad thank you brother God Rest y'all
[1:18:51] need to repent
[1:18:57] and and you know the reason why cuz we
[1:18:59] CU listen the whole point is I'm not
[1:19:02] talking about brother Chad I'm talking
[1:19:04] about the office that he holds yes and
[1:19:07] that's the way God designed it am and
[1:19:10] you have to submit to the way that God
[1:19:12] designed it I'm not talking about
[1:19:14] legalism bondage I'm not talking about
[1:19:16] that I'm not talking about headship in a
[1:19:20] perverted way but I'm talking about
[1:19:22] knowing that when you go to that office
[1:19:24] that's God's going to speak to you
[1:19:27] because you have confidence in the God
[1:19:29] that's over that man and that's the
[1:19:32] channel God chooses to use you have to
[1:19:35] have confidence in
[1:19:38] that cuz cuz the thing of it is I spent
[1:19:40] so many because here's the problem you
[1:19:42] know we can I don't feel like taking my
[1:19:43] Jack I throw the towel because we become
[1:19:46] Preacher Man we get the Persona and then
[1:19:48] there's and then there's the problem I
[1:19:50] can't tell my pastor that because
[1:19:56] and you know what this time I said Lord
[1:19:59] I said m m no cuz to me if there's
[1:20:06] something in me that would destroy my
[1:20:07] Ministry oh please destroy it yes it
[1:20:10] needs to be destroyed it needs to be
[1:20:14] crushed I mean cuz to me if I can't be
[1:20:17] honest and transparent with my brother
[1:20:19] and sister what's the point of standing
[1:20:21] here you understand what I'm
[1:20:24] saying but but the thing of it is
[1:20:26] friends I spent so many years like under
[1:20:29] this like cloud of trying to figure out
[1:20:32] life because uh in this message there's
[1:20:36] so many different facets and movements
[1:20:41] and you know what I mean you got
[1:20:44] authoritarians and you got Ley that it's
[1:20:47] authoritarian you got you got lukewarm
[1:20:51] and you know what I mean and then you
[1:20:53] listen to the message and then
[1:20:55] you look at the message and
[1:20:59] you're
[1:21:01] right you know I
[1:21:05] um see things things can happen in your
[1:21:08] childhood that that that can lay such a
[1:21:11] burden on you and I I'm can I go just a
[1:21:15] little bit longer is that okay please is
[1:21:18] that all right there may be look you may
[1:21:21] there may be with some little one that's
[1:21:23] that's that's tore up right now so just
[1:21:25] you old ones you pray for that little
[1:21:27] one amen cuz I I've been I've
[1:21:30] been crying out to the Lord the whole
[1:21:33] service on whether I should go this or
[1:21:34] not but now here we
[1:21:36] are you know
[1:21:39] for grow growing up in a in a in a in a
[1:21:42] broken
[1:21:44] home uh you know my parents my dad was a
[1:21:50] Believer you know came to the message
[1:21:52] that's probably about 6 years old 7
[1:21:54] years old and you know he's a he's a
[1:21:58] Marine not was you don't say the Marines
[1:22:01] was Marines he's a
[1:22:03] Marine yeah you don't to get that wrong
[1:22:06] so and uh but I mean he is
[1:22:11] he's that man 75 no 77 years old 75 he's
[1:22:16] more than
[1:22:17] 48 7 75 years old he ain't but like 58
[1:22:23] about 130 about 140 lbs I'm still
[1:22:26] terrified of
[1:22:29] it but I love him he he he's my hero but
[1:22:33] you know this dads have that fear that
[1:22:35] they put in you you know and you
[1:22:37] just but but my on my other side my
[1:22:40] family you know they my mama she she she
[1:22:44] just she needs the Lord my stepdad as
[1:22:47] well but you know I I grew up in a home
[1:22:51] where um
[1:22:53] pornography was at Arms Reach from six
[1:22:56] years
[1:23:02] old and
[1:23:04] uh you know the first uh the first drop
[1:23:09] of alcohol I ever had was was uh
[1:23:12] probably about first or second
[1:23:15] grade watching Friday Night
[1:23:19] Fights and so when you grow up in that
[1:23:21] kind of
[1:23:23] atmosphere you know it it um it ingrains
[1:23:27] something in
[1:23:30] you you know you
[1:23:33] uh
[1:23:35] you before you even hit the age of
[1:23:38] accountability you've been
[1:23:52] and you don't have no
[1:23:56] anchor that's why that's why I Look to
[1:24:00] You old ones y was my anchors see see
[1:24:04] cuz ultimately you said brother Gabe the
[1:24:07] Holy Ghost is your anchor well yeah I
[1:24:09] understand that but I like god with skin
[1:24:11] on
[1:24:13] it you know when the Thunder is rolling
[1:24:15] and the lightning is flashing I like a
[1:24:19] god with skin on
[1:24:21] it
[1:24:23] I'm I'm secure in who I believe in so
[1:24:27] I but but to me you know you you look at
[1:24:31] the oldtimers and they they've been I
[1:24:33] love seeing the old one there still got
[1:24:35] a smile on their face you know cuz you
[1:24:38] see something real and it gives you
[1:24:41] courage to keep on
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:44] going
[1:24:46] but you know I dealing with that type of
[1:24:51] Lifestyle you grow up all that just
[1:24:54] being ingrained in
[1:24:56] you and listen uh you know Satan knows
[1:24:59] what he's doing because I I'll be honest
[1:25:03] with you it was easy to give up alcohol
[1:25:06] and drugs in comparison to the lust of
[1:25:09] the
[1:25:12] flesh because it's a
[1:25:14] natural part of
[1:25:16] life but Satan gets in there and
[1:25:19] perverts
[1:25:21] it
[1:25:23] I hope you know we speaking in the mixed
[1:25:25] audience so I'm trying to be
[1:25:28] careful but the thing of it
[1:25:31] is
[1:25:32] Satan he he sets the
[1:25:35] Trap and then he has a way of using the
[1:25:40] shame to put you in
[1:25:47] bondage you know when when brother
[1:25:49] Brandon would would come in in this
[1:25:52] sermon Angel of the Lord he would say he
[1:25:55] would say when I'm getting ready to
[1:25:56] expose the devil you ought to see the
[1:25:59] look on the people's faces he says
[1:26:02] because Satan knows he's going to be
[1:26:05] exposed and and here's the thing if if
[1:26:08] you look if you look differently on me
[1:26:11] after tonight I'm okay with that cuz I I
[1:26:15] know it's it's not a good thing but all
[1:26:18] all I can tell you is is that
[1:26:21] Deliverance
[1:26:23] it it does something to you to where you
[1:26:25] can look back and go maybe I can help
[1:26:27] somebody else that's in that bondage you
[1:26:30] know what I mean like CU to me friends
[1:26:32] God's changed me in such a way that I
[1:26:34] know have words to express
[1:26:37] it but that's what I'm trying to tell
[1:26:39] you look young people look there's too
[1:26:41] many people here somebody's struggling
[1:26:42] with it I'm sorry friends you can't you
[1:26:46] can't put out a phone with some kind of
[1:26:48] bikini or you know I mean to me
[1:26:51] sometimes I just I'm just a amazed that
[1:26:53] when I see young people fing out cell
[1:26:55] phones it's like
[1:26:59] man cuz you know when I was a little boy
[1:27:02] you know you had to you had to find
[1:27:04] something you had to but
[1:27:07] now
[1:27:10] boom and then and the thing of it is
[1:27:13] grown men don't have the ability to
[1:27:16] handle
[1:27:18] it how's a child going to have that
[1:27:21] strength to do
[1:27:26] it there ain't a filter in the world
[1:27:29] that listen my wife and I don't went
[1:27:31] through all kind of filters trying to
[1:27:32] find the right one and they got
[1:27:33] loopholes in
[1:27:36] them come on friends but listen we have
[1:27:41] the thing of it is is what happens in
[1:27:43] young people curiosity catches them and
[1:27:46] Satan knows how to work and then what
[1:27:49] happens is watch he slips it in and and
[1:27:53] the moment you fail now it's instant
[1:27:57] shame and the thing of it is is they can
[1:28:00] go for years laboring hiding
[1:28:07] afraid
[1:28:10] tormented under the guilt and shame of
[1:28:12] it I know what I'm talking
[1:28:15] about but when you when
[1:28:20] you when the grace of God comes to you
[1:28:24] and you and you see that Liberty that
[1:28:27] just a tender hand of Jehovah I don't I
[1:28:29] I to me friends I wish I wish listen
[1:28:32] little ones old ones look Brothers
[1:28:34] listen you Brethren listen if you're
[1:28:36] struggling or something's going look be
[1:28:38] honest with God Amen humble
[1:28:41] yourself and say Lord I got a
[1:28:44] problem yes I got a problem Lord I'm
[1:28:49] struggling with it that look the the
[1:28:52] thing of it is is it's not going to be
[1:28:56] alcohol that deceives
[1:28:58] you this is not going to be you know
[1:29:01] them legalizing marijuana and now all of
[1:29:03] a sudden you're tempted
[1:29:05] to when you go to the gas station that's
[1:29:08] not that's not it friends it's something
[1:29:12] that is a natural part of life that
[1:29:14] Satan has crept into and perverted it in
[1:29:17] such a way and he's made it so readily
[1:29:19] accessible that even the female gender
[1:29:23] is struggling with
[1:29:26] it proven fact science to tell you
[1:29:31] that listen we we it it is you want to
[1:29:34] talk about a
[1:29:36] pandemic and but the thing of it is
[1:29:39] look when you hide it there's no
[1:29:46] Deliverance but when you confess it
[1:29:49] Satan loses yes his
[1:29:55] power and it's the hardest thing
[1:29:58] brethren for you to humble yourself and
[1:30:01] look at your wife and say I messed
[1:30:09] up but I want to tell
[1:30:12] you there's
[1:30:15] Freedom like you've never felt when it
[1:30:20] happens
[1:30:25] you have to be honest not only with
[1:30:28] yourself but your
[1:30:31] family with your brothers with your
[1:30:34] sisters you understand what I'm saying
[1:30:36] look the whole point of it is is we're a
[1:30:38] body yes amen we're a
[1:30:41] body and and listen hey when it's all
[1:30:44] said and done if me sharing this but you
[1:30:47] know I may never stand before you again
[1:30:49] and that's fine but if I can help just
[1:30:52] one to me it's worth it all because I
[1:30:56] know the
[1:31:01] Temptation and and unfortunately it's in
[1:31:04] multitudes of
[1:31:08] pockets and it and it and it starts all
[1:31:10] so subtle you know and and I I could
[1:31:13] only imagine if if I was a message boy
[1:31:17] and then messed
[1:31:18] up how am I going to counsel myself then
[1:31:23] cuz I know
[1:31:28] better well then here's you want me give
[1:31:31] you the
[1:31:31] secret you got to be honest with
[1:31:33] yourself and God and say God I don't
[1:31:35] have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:42] amen oh friends listen don't deceive
[1:31:45] yourself and be living some kind of
[1:31:47] perversion talk about you got the Holy
[1:31:49] Ghost you're born again I mean come on
[1:31:51] now
[1:31:53] listen friends the Holy Ghost puts that
[1:31:55] thing under bondage that thing that
[1:31:57] don't
[1:31:59] have come on friends you got to be
[1:32:02] honest with yourself and say Lord I need
[1:32:03] something more than what I
[1:32:06] have but the problem of it is is we try
[1:32:09] to we try to build some kind of facade
[1:32:12] to make it work and it
[1:32:15] don't you have to be honest with
[1:32:20] yourself and you have to be honest with
[1:32:23] others and say God I got a problem or
[1:32:27] Dad I'm struggling or wifey listen this
[1:32:32] is what is going on and I don't know how
[1:32:35] to overcome
[1:32:37] it and I tell
[1:32:41] you
[1:32:43] when when you make that step of honesty
[1:32:46] and
[1:32:48] transparency it'll give you a freedom
[1:32:50] and a liberty like you've never
[1:32:53] felt because God's word is true amen and
[1:32:57] he said if you would
[1:33:00] confess he's faithful and just to
[1:33:05] forgive and that's not just confessing
[1:33:08] to
[1:33:09] him as confessing to whoever you done it
[1:33:14] against well not even something that
[1:33:16] says maybe you're a young person I'm not
[1:33:17] I hope you understand I'm not I'm not
[1:33:19] confessing I committed adultery I and I
[1:33:22] wouldn't be here right I been went to
[1:33:25] Brother Chad and I'm not qualified you
[1:33:28] understand what I'm saying I hope you
[1:33:30] understand I'm just saying here's the
[1:33:32] thing it's been years ago since all this
[1:33:35] happened I just want you to know I'm I I
[1:33:38] feel so burdened for people cuz I I know
[1:33:41] what that bondage is and it's I'm not I
[1:33:43] hope you understand this ain't last week
[1:33:45] that this happened I'm
[1:33:46] just it's a freedom friends and to me
[1:33:49] it's like you don't ever hear nobody
[1:33:50] talk about these things things and it's
[1:33:52] like you can't tell me like the elephant
[1:33:54] in the room you know what I mean and
[1:33:57] it's like hold fast no no no there
[1:34:00] cannot be people that listen ain't every
[1:34:03] way ain't everybody is ready Rapture
[1:34:06] Ready
[1:34:09] and right so so there's problems but the
[1:34:13] thing of it is is we have to be
[1:34:18] honest and we have to we have to say
[1:34:22] you have to have that
[1:34:23] conversation with your
[1:34:27] family and say I used to be there but
[1:34:31] God delivered
[1:34:33] me I'm ashamed to have to confess this
[1:34:37] to
[1:34:38] you but I'm not ashamed to confess the
[1:34:42] delivering power that the holy spirit
[1:34:47] gives and and you know
[1:34:50] what um
[1:34:53] like I said when it
[1:34:56] happens to
[1:34:58] me it it doesn't matter what happens
[1:35:01] tomorrow cuz the Lord Jesus he is my
[1:35:05] tomorrow you know what I mean like no
[1:35:07] matter what happens in life to me I I've
[1:35:10] come to a place to where there's there
[1:35:14] there's a settledness in my life that
[1:35:17] I've never felt on this measure before
[1:35:20] and and and to me I'm at a spot where
[1:35:24] it's like Lord I want every I want
[1:35:27] everybody to feel
[1:35:29] this you know what I mean I mean I mean
[1:35:33] when you when you when you have that
[1:35:34] reality of God it's
[1:35:36] like it's like everything that you've
[1:35:39] heard on the tapes is real in your life
[1:35:43] you understand what I'm saying I mean
[1:35:45] it's like I mean it's like to to maybe
[1:35:47] for me it's such an
[1:35:49] extreme of of my past and then the now
[1:35:53] but it's so overwhelming but to me I
[1:35:55] look and I think I don't know how you
[1:35:57] tick in your mind and in your heart but
[1:36:00] to me friends I'll be honest with you
[1:36:02] when I'm sitting in row five it's all I
[1:36:04] can do not to
[1:36:07] bust praise
[1:36:10] God and to me it's like because it's
[1:36:14] real it's not emotion it it's a life
[1:36:17] that pulsates and you God you talk to
[1:36:20] God and God talks back and God helps you
[1:36:23] overcome something and whatever you're
[1:36:25] struggling with you have the ability
[1:36:27] that whenever you're dealing with it on
[1:36:28] the job you can see Satan come at you
[1:36:31] and you can flip the script on him and
