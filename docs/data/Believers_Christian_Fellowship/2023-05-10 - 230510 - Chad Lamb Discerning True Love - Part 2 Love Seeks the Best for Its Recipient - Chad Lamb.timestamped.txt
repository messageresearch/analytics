[6:16] together please
[6:19] dear Lord Jesus I am so thankful Lord to
[6:22] be standing here by your grace Lord you
[6:25] have brought us together once again
[6:27] you know we don't come of our own Merit
[6:30] our own ability
[6:31] but we simply come because you've
[6:33] ordained it to be so
[6:35] we love you for that we're so thankful
[6:37] Lord that you first loved us
[6:40] we pray God that you would take
[6:41] preeminence among us this evening and
[6:43] have your way may each one of us yield
[6:45] ourselves into your hand Lord that you
[6:48] might use us that you might speak to us
[6:50] that you might teach us
[6:52] come on maybe hear from you the things
[6:54] that we have need of in this hour
[6:56] may your word Lord find a Dwelling Place
[6:59] in our hearts
[7:00] they magnify through our lives and be
[7:03] manifest
[7:04] in this flesh nor we give ourselves you
[7:08] ask that you would take your place at
[7:10] the head of the table this evening that
[7:12] you would break the bread of life and
[7:14] feed your sheep for we surrender now to
[7:16] you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[7:19] amen amen God bless you while we're
[7:22] standing let's look into the word let's
[7:24] look at first John together
[7:27] and then we're going to continue on with
[7:29] the same subject we were on last
[7:31] Wednesday and Discerning true love this
[7:33] will be part two I'll give you my
[7:34] subtitle in just a minute but we're
[7:36] going to go to First John chapter 4.
[7:38] we're going to say how much I enjoyed
[7:40] the weekend meetings it was such a
[7:42] tremendous blessing brother Abraham left
[7:45] with brother Dan Ratliff to go up to
[7:47] preach at his church this evening then
[7:49] I'm beginning on a plane tomorrow and
[7:51] heading to Phoenix for some meetings in
[7:52] Arizona so remember to keep him in
[7:54] prayer also brother Ben siebel let me
[7:57] know that he'll be going to brother
[7:58] Dan's this Sunday to preach up there
[8:00] should be praying for him as well let's
[8:03] look here at first first John chapter 4
[8:06] verse 16.
[8:11] and we and we have known and believed
[8:14] the love that God hath to us God is love
[8:18] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[8:21] God and God in him let's go to Romans
[8:24] chapter 5.
[8:27] it was these scriptures we read last
[8:28] Sunday we were going to read them here's
[8:30] review Romans chapter 5.
[8:34] verse 5.
[8:38] Romans 5 and 5.
[8:40] and hope maketh not a shame because the
[8:43] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[8:45] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[8:48] man God bless you as you take your seats
[8:51] so we realize God is love and they that
[8:53] dwell in love dwell in God and the love
[8:55] of God is in our bra in our hearts
[8:57] that broaden our hearts by the Holy
[8:59] Ghost which is given to us so it's not
[9:01] possible to have this kind of love
[9:03] without god without the new birth
[9:05] without the Life of Christ and the
[9:07] inside this isn't something you can work
[9:09] your way up to amen this is the love of
[9:11] God that is shed abroad in our hearts by
[9:13] the Holy Ghost amen but we want to talk
[9:16] about Discerning true love amen because
[9:18] sometimes like brother Branham said
[9:20] there's two types of love that he was
[9:22] speaking about mainly he was contrasting
[9:24] agape love with filio love and one he
[9:27] called an Earthly love or a human love
[9:29] and the other called Divine love or a
[9:31] Heavenly love
[9:32] that he was showing us the difference
[9:34] between the the two and he uses that
[9:36] example many many times where he says
[9:37] filial love will make you jealous over
[9:40] your wife if if some other man is
[9:42] interested in her amen even that that
[9:44] love can impassionate you so much that
[9:46] you would want to kill the man but he's
[9:48] at Agape Love we want you to pray for
[9:50] his soul that he'll be saved and so he
[9:52] says they're so different from one
[9:53] another Amen in the the Earthly love the
[9:56] filial love is the one that that we've
[9:58] grown up understanding amen but but
[10:00] there is another love that's much higher
[10:02] than that and that's what we want to
[10:04] focus on so in this Discerning true love
[10:06] part too I'd like to take for a subtitle
[10:08] love seeks the best for its recipient
[10:12] love seeks the best for its recipient
[10:14] and we're going to look at this from two
[10:16] different sides two different angles of
[10:18] this and I'll explain those to you as we
[10:20] go along I want to read this quote again
[10:22] from the thyatarian church age out of
[10:24] the church age book brother says I want
[10:26] to give a warning right here it says
[10:28] concerning the last days that because of
[10:31] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[10:33] wax cold in the laodicean or last age
[10:36] self-love and love for material things
[10:39] will take the place of the true love of
[10:41] God
[10:42] so we see we're fighting self-love and
[10:45] the love for material things and the
[10:47] self-love is so
[10:50] I think it's so much more uh
[10:54] I think it's so much more ingrained in
[10:58] our flesh and our human existence than
[10:59] we realize
[11:01] this self-love and pride was injected
[11:03] into human race at the fall during the
[11:05] hybridization amen because these are
[11:08] attributes of Lucifer himself pride and
[11:10] self-love amen and and through the
[11:13] serpent he was able to inject himself
[11:15] into the human race and now that was
[11:17] injected into us in our fallen nature
[11:20] and we are everyone struggling with
[11:22] pride and self-love love love for self
[11:25] and when I when I meditate on this
[11:27] subject when I've spent quite a bit of
[11:29] time meditating on it praying over it
[11:31] and I'm appalled I'm absolutely appalled
[11:35] at myself
[11:37] because I realize how much my
[11:40] selfishness is my motivation
[11:44] I mean if we're really honest with
[11:45] ourselves and really just just get down
[11:48] to just a CR The Brute raw honesty amen
[11:52] much of what we do is because of Love of
[11:54] self
[11:55] we're so motivated by these wrong
[11:58] motives amen and it really takes God
[12:01] Amen it takes the Holy Spirit to really
[12:03] break us out of that because it's in it
[12:05] was embedded in US I mean at Birth amen
[12:08] so now we we need the spirit of God and
[12:11] we need the word of God because the word
[12:13] is a seed and that word goes in and and
[12:15] brings life and and the spirit of God
[12:17] Amen gives life to the word we need to
[12:20] receive this word on love amen and let
[12:23] it come to life amen by the working of
[12:25] the spirit because we are so stuck
[12:29] in self
[12:30] -love amen self-awareness self-focus and
[12:34] and and and so when I really really get
[12:37] down to it I'm really honest and I quit
[12:39] making excuses for myself I realize
[12:42] there's way too much self-love there
[12:45] I'm appalled by it
[12:47] amen and I don't say that and awaken
[12:49] dimming that's the reality that's just
[12:51] where we're at amen we need God
[12:54] we absolutely need the spirit of God we
[12:57] need the word of God in our hearts to
[12:59] Blossom I mean to germinate to come to
[13:01] life amen by the by the working of the
[13:03] spirit we need it to take over amen
[13:05] because we don't have the capacity in
[13:07] ourselves
[13:08] we don't have the capacity to love right
[13:10] within ourselves amen it has to be God
[13:13] in us
[13:14] living this out
[13:16] so when we when we look at this when we
[13:19] begin to discern true love brother
[13:21] Branham was so good at explaining to us
[13:24] true compassion is to do the will of God
[13:27] not what we necessarily would call
[13:29] Compassion but true compassion is to do
[13:32] the will of God and and brother Venom
[13:34] uses this example of of God of Jesus
[13:39] Christ going to the pool of Bethesda
[13:41] where there's so many sick and lame
[13:43] blind Afflicted people all around the
[13:45] pool waiting for the troubling of the
[13:47] waters and hoping that they can be the
[13:49] first ones to get in to get healed but
[13:51] yet amen Jesus Christ would go there led
[13:55] by God Amen to work out God's plan and
[13:58] in so doing he'd have to walk around
[14:00] mothers with sick babies he would have
[14:02] to step over cripples and work his way
[14:04] through the crowd to heal one amen and
[14:07] brother Madam said true compassion is to
[14:09] do the will of God Amen it doesn't mean
[14:12] that Jesus had no feeling for the other
[14:14] people because we know he did have
[14:16] feeling for the people amen but he was
[14:18] controlled by a greater love
[14:21] and that was his love agape love perfect
[14:24] love amen so we want to get into this
[14:26] and start explaining some of that uh
[14:28] with God's help but we realize if we
[14:32] look at second Peter chapter one
[14:44] second Peter chapter one and I when when
[14:46] we talk about this love I'm always so
[14:49] reluctant because every time you explain
[14:50] something you hit it from one angle and
[14:52] then there's another angle and you never
[14:53] feel like you cover all the bases but I
[14:55] don't anyone everybody I don't want
[14:57] anybody to walk away feeling like agape
[14:59] love is somehow cold and formal and has
[15:02] no feeling
[15:03] right but agape love is not motivated by
[15:07] your emotions
[15:09] it's not motivated by emotions it's not
[15:12] controlled by emotions it's controlled
[15:13] by something higher than your emotions
[15:16] because your emotions are coming from a
[15:18] fallen creature from a fallen carnal
[15:20] spirit so it's not motivated but it
[15:22] doesn't mean amen that there's not a
[15:24] side effect of an emotional response to
[15:26] agape love
[15:28] remember when brother Brennan said if
[15:29] you ever had that feeling in your heart
[15:31] that thing that you would love to just
[15:32] take out and hug it sometime
[15:35] I hope you've had that yeah
[15:37] amen that closeness to God that that God
[15:40] coming and brooding over your heart and
[15:41] you would just love to take it out of
[15:43] your heart and hug it one time
[15:45] amen so we don't ever want to think that
[15:47] this agape love amen is is cold stiff
[15:50] rigid informal
[15:53] I don't wanna I I personally don't want
[15:55] to love God that way
[15:58] so praise God
[16:01] so in second Peter chapter 1 verse 2
[16:05] and just look at this scripture for a
[16:07] second grace and peace be multiplied
[16:08] unto you through the knowledge of God
[16:10] and of Jesus our lord according as his
[16:12] divine power is given unto us all things
[16:14] that get that pertaining to life and
[16:17] godliness through the knowledge of him
[16:18] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[16:21] whereby we are given are given unto us
[16:24] exceeding great and precious promises
[16:26] that by these you might be partakers of
[16:28] the divine nature having escaped the
[16:30] corruption that is in the world through
[16:31] lust and beside this giving all
[16:33] diligence add to your faith virtue
[16:35] divert your knowledge to knowledge
[16:37] Temperance to Temperance patience and
[16:39] the patience godliness and the godliness
[16:41] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[16:43] kindness charity that's love
[16:46] for if these things be in you and abound
[16:48] they make you that you should neither be
[16:50] Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge
[16:51] of our Lord Jesus Christ so he said
[16:54] according to these precious promises we
[16:56] can be partakers of the divine nature
[16:57] and then he begins to explain the the
[17:00] the the growth uh unto adoption and the
[17:03] stature of a perfect man coming into the
[17:04] very image of Christ and add to your
[17:06] faith this and and then add an ad till
[17:09] you get all the way up amen and when you
[17:11] come to the end you have brotherly
[17:13] kindness which is brotherly love it's
[17:14] the word Philadelphia which means
[17:16] brother leilan and then upon that rest
[17:18] the cap of Love of Charity which is
[17:22] perfect love agape love amen so the the
[17:25] end of our growth is love
[17:28] the the Pinnacle that we're coming to
[17:31] his love because God is love that
[17:33] Capstone is God Amen and God is love
[17:36] that Capstone is love
[17:39] so when we grow into the statue of a
[17:40] perfect man coming into Perfection amen
[17:43] what what is the what is the the final
[17:46] piece is the love of God because all of
[17:49] this is directed by the love of God and
[17:51] all of this is controlled by the love of
[17:53] God all of this is sealed and vulcanized
[17:55] by the love of God Amen and so that's
[17:58] what we're growing into so love is not a
[18:01] trivial emotional subject amen God is
[18:04] love
[18:05] we're growing into the image of God Amen
[18:07] into the stature of a perfect man amen
[18:10] and to do so we will have to grow into
[18:11] perfect love
[18:14] praise God
[18:15] so it's it's not it's not the subject
[18:18] like the world takes in love it is our
[18:21] goal it is our destiny it is our Target
[18:25] let's go to First Corinthians chapter
[18:27] 13.
[18:34] First Corinthians chapter 13 and and um
[18:39] read about this love this word charity
[18:42] is the word love this word charity in
[18:45] the Greek is agape which is the love
[18:47] that brother Benham was telling us about
[18:48] agape love the perfect love
[18:51] and in First Corinthians Chapter 13
[18:53] Verse 1 it says though I speak with the
[18:56] tongue of men and angels and have not
[18:57] charity I am become a sounding brasser
[19:00] tinkling symbol
[19:01] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[19:03] and understand all Mysteries
[19:05] I want you to catch this
[19:07] let's just think about it
[19:09] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[19:11] understand all Mysteries
[19:15] all Mysteries
[19:17] and all knowledge
[19:19] and though I have all faith
[19:23] so many times we think that
[19:25] understanding all the Mysteries and
[19:27] having all the knowledge of the word and
[19:29] having all faith is the destination
[19:33] it seems so because of the opening of
[19:35] the seals and coming to the revealing of
[19:38] the Mysteries and the understanding of
[19:40] what the mystery wasn't about so it
[19:41] seems like our destination is all faith
[19:44] and all Mysteries and all knowledge but
[19:46] that's not the destination if you attain
[19:48] to that and still don't have agape love
[19:51] it means nothing
[19:53] this is what Paul's telling us
[19:55] let's read it again and though I have
[19:57] the gift of Prophecy and understand all
[19:58] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[20:01] have all Faith so that I could remove
[20:02] mountains and have not charity I am
[20:05] nothing
[20:09] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[20:10] the poor and though I give my body to be
[20:12] burned and have not charity it
[20:15] profitests me nothing
[20:17] see this looks like love though I missed
[20:20] all my goodness that looks like love but
[20:22] if I do that and don't have love
[20:24] I'm nothing
[20:28] it profit me nothing
[20:30] verse 4 charity suffereth long now we're
[20:33] going to look at the attributes
[20:35] of perfect love
[20:37] because we're trying to to keep our
[20:39] minds in discernment of love what re
[20:41] what is real love and how do I discern
[20:43] what is real love
[20:46] Charities suffereth long and is kind
[20:50] charity Envy is not
[20:53] it's not envious
[20:55] charity vaunteth not itself it doesn't
[20:57] promote itself and it is not puffed up
[20:59] it's not vain
[21:02] does not behave itself unseemly
[21:06] seeketh not her own this is what I would
[21:08] like to focus on today love seeketh not
[21:11] her own
[21:13] but for others
[21:15] it's not selfish
[21:17] true love is not selfish
[21:19] amen seeketh not our own is not easily
[21:23] provoked
[21:24] thinketh no evil
[21:26] Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices
[21:29] in the truth beareth all things
[21:32] believeth all things hope with all
[21:35] things and and endureth all things
[21:39] charity never faileth
[21:43] praise God
[21:45] so we see these attributes of this love
[21:47] and this is what we we want I want to
[21:50] focus this evening on
[21:53] um seek is not her own and so like I
[21:56] said before what we're what what my
[21:58] my subtitle
[22:01] is love seeks the best for its recipient
[22:04] love seeketh not her own seeks the best
[22:06] for its recipient love seeks the best
[22:08] for the one who is loved
[22:11] not necessarily what's best for the one
[22:13] doing the loving
[22:16] all right so last time we talked about
[22:18] uh true love must be sacrificial and so
[22:21] this will tie in with that and then
[22:23] we're going to go a little farther let's
[22:24] go to John 17 the Gospel of John 17
[22:28] verse 19.
[22:36] John 17 and 19.
[22:43] and he says and for their sakes I
[22:45] sanctify myself that they also might be
[22:48] Sanctified through the truth
[22:50] so Jesus makes a statement for their
[22:53] sakes
[22:54] not for his sake for their sakes I
[22:56] sanctify myself
[22:57] this is what brother Birmingham says in
[22:59] the message adoption he said that's one
[23:01] of the sweetest words that I ever heard
[23:03] father I sanctify myself for their sake
[23:06] do you know he had a right to have a
[23:07] home he was a human you know that he had
[23:10] a right to have a wife he was a man he
[23:12] had a right to all these things but he
[23:14] said father I sanctify myself for their
[23:17] sake I sanctify myself
[23:19] I was talking to a little preacher
[23:21] yesterday going to preach for him in a
[23:23] few nights up here on the highway and I
[23:25] asked about a certain thing he said yes
[23:27] brother Benham but most of my people
[23:28] doesn't believe in that so brother
[23:31] Adam's questioning him about something
[23:32] something he's doing or preached or said
[23:34] and he questions brother Branham and
[23:37] brother bear says and then this man says
[23:39] yes but my people don't believe it that
[23:41] way
[23:42] listen to the dialogue
[23:44] I said most all of them are legalists
[23:46] president was asking questions most all
[23:48] of them are legalists yes
[23:51] the brother doesn't believe that but he
[23:53] said for their sake oh I wanted to hug
[23:56] his neck for their sake see I sanctify
[23:59] myself for their sake
[24:01] here's a man whose people or a little
[24:03] bit on the legalistic side and they're
[24:05] not even really believing something the
[24:06] right way he's got a better
[24:07] understanding but he is sanctifying
[24:10] himself for his people and brother bear
[24:12] said I wanted to hug him because that
[24:14] was right
[24:15] we always think it's right we always
[24:17] think it's right Amen to nail everything
[24:19] to the wall and make everything right
[24:20] and correct everything sometimes it's
[24:22] right just to endure with somebody for a
[24:24] little while
[24:25] somebody was right is not to strip them
[24:27] amen of what they have amen but to love
[24:30] them anyways and sanctify ourselves for
[24:32] for their sakes
[24:35] amen
[24:37] sometimes we we think being able to
[24:40] correct everything somehow makes us
[24:41] special
[24:43] like Jesus wasn't there able to correct
[24:47] everything everybody around him was
[24:49] doing
[24:50] and even brother Branham and Peregrine's
[24:52] testimony brother Branham tells
[24:53] Peregrine brother Perry where God has me
[24:55] most everything you do would be said to
[24:57] me
[24:59] but brother Brandon wasn't nailing him
[25:01] and corrected him and making him feel
[25:03] little he was just loving brother Perry
[25:05] and being a friend to him and being a
[25:07] brother
[25:08] amen
[25:09] so this is where
[25:11] uh he says I wanted to hug his neck for
[25:15] their sakes I sanctify myself for their
[25:16] sakes oh Jesus was training 12 men that
[25:20] through these 12 men was to take the
[25:21] gospel to the world and he said for
[25:23] their sakes I sanctify myself
[25:25] make yourself for your neighbor's sake
[25:27] for somebody else to say don't use your
[25:30] Liberty for a cloak said Paul but
[25:32] sanctify yourself behave yourself in the
[25:35] neighborhood like a real Christian ought
[25:36] to let your communication be if you meet
[25:39] your enemy sanctify yourself for his
[25:41] sake not knowing what you might do
[25:44] so now you sanctify yourselves not for
[25:47] our sakes not to get something from God
[25:49] we sanctify ourselves so that in the
[25:52] eyes of others we do nothing to stumble
[25:54] anybody else not for gaining something
[25:57] from God Merit or favor or something
[25:59] like that but we sanctify ourselves for
[26:02] others sake
[26:04] let's look at this in the Bible let's go
[26:05] to Philippians I want to read several
[26:07] scriptures right back to back here and
[26:09] let's start with Philippians
[26:11] we're going to look at the Epistles of
[26:13] Paul
[26:15] Philippians chapter 2
[26:18] verse 1.
[26:22] Philippians 2 and 1 if there be
[26:24] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[26:27] any comfort of love any Fellowship of
[26:29] the spirit any bowels and mercies
[26:31] fulfill you my joy that you be
[26:33] like-minded having the same love being
[26:35] of one Accord of one mind
[26:38] let nothing be done through Strife or
[26:40] vainglory but in lowliness of Mind Let
[26:43] each esteemed mother better than
[26:45] themselves
[26:47] look not every man on his own things but
[26:51] every man also on the things of others
[26:54] let this mind be in you which was also
[26:56] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[26:58] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[27:00] with God but made himself of no
[27:02] reputation and took upon him the form of
[27:04] a servant and was made in the likeness
[27:06] of men and being found in fashion as a
[27:09] man he humbled himself and became
[27:10] obedient unto death even the death of
[27:13] the cross
[27:15] he Sanctified himself and he also
[27:17] offered himself
[27:19] knowing who he was thinking and not
[27:22] robbery to be equal with God he was able
[27:24] to Humble himself and if we know who we
[27:26] are we should be able to Humble
[27:27] ourselves for somebody else
[27:30] not thinking on our own things but for
[27:33] the sake of others on others things
[27:36] let's turn over to First Corinthians
[27:38] chapter 10.
[27:45] First Corinthians chapter 10.
[27:53] in verse 23.
[27:58] First Corinthians 10 23 all things are
[28:01] lawful for me this is Apostle Paul
[28:02] speaking all things are lawful for me
[28:05] but all things are not expedient
[28:07] all things are lawful for me but all
[28:09] things edify not
[28:12] he's not only talking about edifying
[28:14] himself
[28:15] he's also speaking about others
[28:18] said all things are lawful for me I've
[28:20] been freed from the law all things are
[28:22] lawful to me but not everything that I
[28:24] do is Expedia and not everything I do
[28:26] will edify and he's not just talking
[28:29] about himself
[28:30] you'll find it in the context as we read
[28:33] let no man seek his own but every man
[28:36] another's wealth
[28:38] whatsoever sold in the shambles that eat
[28:40] asking no questions for conscience sake
[28:43] for the Earth is the Lord's in the
[28:44] fullness thereof if if any of them that
[28:47] believe not bid you to a feast and ye be
[28:49] disposed to go whatsoever set before you
[28:52] eat asking no questions for conscience
[28:54] sake
[28:55] but if any man say unto you this is
[28:57] offered in sacrifice into Idols eat not
[29:00] for his sake that showed it and for
[29:02] conscience sake for the Earth is the
[29:04] Lord's and the fullness thereof
[29:06] conscience I say not thine own
[29:09] but of the other for why is my Liberty
[29:11] judge of another man's conscience for if
[29:14] I by Grace be a partaker why am I evil
[29:17] spoken of for that for which I give
[29:18] thanks whether therefore you eat or
[29:21] drink or whatever you do do all to the
[29:24] glory of God
[29:27] give none offense neither to the Jews
[29:29] nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of
[29:32] God even as I please all men in all
[29:35] things not seeking my own Prophet but
[29:38] the prophet of many that they may be
[29:40] saved
[29:41] here Paul is saying all things are
[29:43] lawful but not all things are expedient
[29:46] and not all things edify he is not
[29:48] talking about his own edification he's
[29:50] talking about the edification of those
[29:51] that are around him
[29:53] there's things that he knows are is not
[29:56] under the bondage of the law he's free
[29:58] to do but he will not do because of what
[30:00] it will do for somebody who's watching
[30:01] amen and if somebody who's an unbeliever
[30:03] bids him to a feast amen eat whatever
[30:06] they set before you amen giving thanks
[30:08] to God because the idol has no power
[30:10] over you but if the man says this was
[30:12] offered to an idol eat it not for the
[30:15] sake of him who told you
[30:17] not for you Paul was still free
[30:20] and he said do it for conscience say not
[30:22] your own conscience not because all of a
[30:24] sudden you feel guilty doing it now but
[30:26] for the conscience of the one who's
[30:27] watching amen so you don't put a
[30:29] stumbling stone at their feet
[30:31] why because love is always for the
[30:34] benefit of the one being loved
[30:37] for their benefit I'll stop for their
[30:40] benefit I won't for their benefit I'll
[30:42] not partake for their benefit
[30:45] does that make sense this is agape love
[30:48] Agape Love Will sanctify myself for
[30:51] their sakes I sanctify myself
[30:54] amen
[30:56] let's go to Romans 14 now
[31:16] Romans
[31:18] 14 13.
[31:22] Romans 14 13. let us not therefore judge
[31:25] one another anymore but judge this
[31:27] rather that no man put a stumbling block
[31:30] on her occasion to fall in his brother's
[31:32] way
[31:33] I know and I'm persuaded by the Lord
[31:35] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[31:37] itself but to him that esteemeth
[31:39] anything to be unclean to him it is
[31:41] unclean
[31:42] But If thy brother be grieved with thy
[31:44] meat now walk us thou not charitably
[31:47] that means agape
[31:49] Thou You're not walking in love if what
[31:53] you're doing is offending your brother
[31:54] and you know it's offending your brother
[31:55] but you're doing it anyways because you
[31:57] don't have to listen to him
[32:03] you're not walking in love
[32:07] I mean if you want to do it in your own
[32:08] home that's fine but if you're in the
[32:10] presence of that brother and you know
[32:11] that's offensive and you know it's a
[32:12] stumbling block for them and you do it
[32:14] anyways and calling his conviction
[32:16] stupid
[32:17] that's not love
[32:20] will sanctify myself for another sake
[32:25] But If thy brother be grieved with thy
[32:27] meat now walk us thou not charitably
[32:29] destroy not him with thy meat for whom
[32:32] Christ died
[32:33] not then your good be evil spoken of for
[32:36] the kingdom of God is not meet and drink
[32:38] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[32:40] the Holy Ghost for he that for he that
[32:44] and these things serveth Christ is
[32:45] acceptable to God and approved of men
[32:47] let us therefore follow after the things
[32:49] which make for peace and things
[32:51] wherewith one may edify another for meat
[32:55] destroyeth not the work of God all
[32:57] things indeed are pure but it is evil
[33:00] for that man who eateth with offense
[33:03] it wasn't wrong to eat it was wrong to
[33:06] eat when you knew your brother was
[33:08] offended
[33:09] that's what was wrong that was the Paul
[33:12] calls it evil
[33:16] verse 21.
[33:18] it is good neither to eat flesh nor
[33:20] drink wine nor anything whereby thy
[33:22] brother stumbleth or is offended or is
[33:25] made weak
[33:27] all things are lawful but not all things
[33:29] edify my brother
[33:32] you see we we even look at the
[33:35] scriptures with self-focus
[33:38] right when you read the scriptures all
[33:41] things are expedient all things are
[33:43] lawful but all things are expedient
[33:45] doesn't edify yeah that wouldn't edify
[33:46] me he's not talking about himself he's
[33:48] talking about his brother
[33:50] but we read the scriptures with
[33:52] self-focus
[33:54] and he says don't eat the meat once you
[33:56] know it's offered for conscience sake
[33:57] he's not talking about his conscience
[33:59] he's talking about the conscience of the
[34:00] one who told him but yet we keep reading
[34:02] scriptures with self-focus this is how
[34:04] ingrained this Fallen nature is in us
[34:07] but we got to start reading it the way
[34:09] it's written amen and sanctify ourselves
[34:11] for those that are around us amen if
[34:13] it's causing an offense I'll abstain
[34:15] with it so I don't offend my brother
[34:18] because that's love
[34:22] that's love
[34:24] praise God
[34:25] that I don't stumble my brother
[34:29] in these things
[34:31] brother Ben said
[34:33] in that message that Dale Calvary said
[34:35] he was just one man the perfect man he
[34:38] gave his life and he made an example for
[34:40] you now what must we do now the first
[34:43] thing I want to say is Jesus never lived
[34:45] for himself his life was spent for
[34:47] others that's perfectly eternal life
[34:51] what is eternal life
[34:53] is it knowing the Mysteries
[34:55] no eternal life is the very life of God
[34:58] and God is love
[35:00] well you know the Mysteries absolutely
[35:02] because God by love has revealed them to
[35:04] us
[35:06] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[35:08] say you go to church and you do good
[35:10] things that's fine but when you live
[35:12] your life to yourself you haven't
[35:14] eternal life
[35:16] eternal life is living for others it
[35:19] proved it when it came to the Lamb of
[35:20] God he lived and had eternal life
[35:22] because he did not live for himself he
[35:24] lived for others and you receive eternal
[35:26] life by receiving that day and you don't
[35:28] live for yourself no more you live for
[35:30] others
[35:31] someone said how can you stand and let
[35:33] anybody call you such bad names you
[35:36] don't live for yourself you live for
[35:38] others that you might redeem that man
[35:41] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[35:43] the church has forgot that they were
[35:45] Sons you are Sons you're taking Christ's
[35:47] place your son so don't live for
[35:50] yourself live for others
[35:53] well brother Brandon I can't live for
[35:54] this I can live for this brother because
[35:56] he sure is a nice man that's not it live
[35:59] for that man who hates you live for that
[36:01] person who'd kill you if he could if
[36:03] they could that's what they done to him
[36:05] they killed him and he died that he
[36:07] might save them that's eternal life when
[36:09] you get when you get that's in your
[36:12] bosom you're facing heaven then but you
[36:14] sacrifice your own things give them up
[36:16] like the sheep gives its wool you look
[36:18] on towards Calvary
[36:21] amen I I praise God the reality of the
[36:26] truth of the word is it's impossible
[36:29] let's just say it that way it's
[36:30] impossible without the spirit of God
[36:33] this word is so contrary to our human
[36:37] nature it's so contrary to our fallen
[36:39] condition that it is going to absolutely
[36:41] take the spirit of God coming and living
[36:43] this through US amen but we must be able
[36:46] to discern what is true and genuine love
[36:48] and one is not amen and resist the wrong
[36:50] and accept the riot and open ourselves
[36:52] to it and say go on let that love flow
[36:54] through me
[36:56] as I wrote I wrote on the white board
[36:58] here last Wednesday I wrote the a couple
[37:01] of lines one was true love sacrifice
[37:04] itself or the lover for the loved
[37:07] true love perverted love sacrifice
[37:09] others the loved for self
[37:13] perverted levels sacrifice the object of
[37:16] their affection for themselves
[37:19] that's not the love of God
[37:21] so and I'm going to I'm going to go a
[37:25] little further than that in just a few
[37:27] minutes
[37:29] let's go back to First John chapter 3.
[37:42] first John chapter 3.
[37:49] and we know that when we come to the
[37:52] Pinnacle
[37:53] of the Statue of perfect man this
[37:54] pyramid that brother Branham drawn out
[37:56] we have brotherly love and then the
[37:58] Capstone perfect love
[38:00] in First John 3 14 says
[38:03] we know that we have passed from death
[38:05] into life because we love the brethren
[38:08] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[38:11] in
[38:13] death
[38:16] we're not talking about trivial
[38:18] feel-good love everybody love each other
[38:20] be nice to your neighbor that's not
[38:21] biblical love
[38:23] biblical love is much harder than that
[38:26] it's not give something away and help
[38:28] your neighbor lady mower lawn and be a
[38:30] nice person a genuine love is much
[38:33] harder than that genuine love is a death
[38:36] to self
[38:37] it's a sacrifice
[38:39] so he says I want to read this again
[38:42] verse 14 we know that we have passed
[38:44] from death into life because we love the
[38:46] Brethren he that loveth not his brother
[38:48] abideth in death whosoever hate his
[38:51] brother is a murderer and you know that
[38:54] no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
[38:57] him
[38:58] hereby perceive we the love of God
[39:00] because he laid down his life for us and
[39:02] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[39:05] brethren
[39:06] this is how we perceive the love of God
[39:08] because he died for us he laid down his
[39:10] life for us we love him because he first
[39:12] loved us and that example is now our
[39:16] example
[39:18] that we should lay down our lives
[39:20] for the brethren
[39:22] but whoso
[39:24] but whoso hath this world's good and
[39:27] seeth his brother having need and
[39:28] shutteth up his boughs of compassion
[39:30] from him how dwelleth the love of God in
[39:32] him my little children let us not love
[39:34] and word neither in tongue but indeed
[39:37] and in truth amen let love have action
[39:41] not just nice words
[39:44] not just nice phrases
[39:46] amen
[39:48] so let's go to Philippians chapter one
[39:52] now I want to look back at the life of
[39:54] Paul
[39:56] for a moment
[39:58] Philippians chapter 1
[40:06] and remember we said
[40:09] true love sacrifices the love or herself
[40:12] for the love and here Paul comes in
[40:15] Philippians chapter 1 verse 21. he says
[40:18] for to me to live is Christ and to die
[40:20] is gain
[40:22] so this is where he's at to live is
[40:24] Christ to die is gain but if I live in
[40:26] the flesh this is the fruit of my labor
[40:29] yet what shall I choose I want not for I
[40:32] am in a straight betwixture too having a
[40:33] desire to depart and be with Christ
[40:35] Which is far better
[40:37] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[40:40] more needful for you
[40:41] where did Paul want to go he wanted to
[40:43] go
[40:44] he was done he had had enough
[40:47] he wanted to go be with Christ but he
[40:49] says to abide in the flesh is more
[40:51] needful for you so who is Paul
[40:53] sacrificing himself for
[40:57] amen so
[41:01] nevertheless verse 24 to abide in the
[41:03] flesh is more needful for you and having
[41:05] this confidence I know that I shall
[41:07] abide and continue with you all for your
[41:09] furtherance and joy of Faith he wasn't
[41:12] sticking around for himself he wanted to
[41:14] go he was sticking around for their
[41:15] further and joy of faith that you're
[41:18] rejoicing made me more abundant in Jesus
[41:20] Christ for me by my coming to you again
[41:24] let's look at Romans chapter 12 now
[41:40] Romans chapter 12.
[41:43] verse 9.
[41:46] Romans 12 and 9 let love be without
[41:47] dissimulation aboard that which is evil
[41:50] cleaved to that which is good be kindly
[41:52] affectionate one to another with
[41:53] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[41:56] another so this is the example that Paul
[41:59] has given us and he demonstrated it by
[42:01] the life that he lived amen but now
[42:03] let's go to look at Jesus in John 16.
[42:13] I'm wanting to jump into the next part
[42:15] but I want to finish this
[42:17] and paint this picture then jump into
[42:19] the next part
[42:20] John 16
[42:22] verse 7.
[42:25] John 16 and 7.
[42:27] nevertheless I tell you the truth is
[42:31] expedient for you that I go away
[42:33] for if I go not away the comforter will
[42:35] not come unto you but if I depart I will
[42:38] send him unto you
[42:40] Jesus now is looking as disciples and
[42:42] he's saying it's expedient for you are
[42:44] profitable for you that I go away and
[42:47] none of them believed him
[42:50] can you imagine walking with Jesus
[42:52] spending time with him being in boasts
[42:55] with him and along the way and in the
[42:56] house with him in all the meetings and
[42:58] working with him in the ministry and
[43:00] Jesus looks at you and says I'm leaving
[43:01] you what would you want
[43:03] would you want him to go away or would
[43:05] you want him to stay and when he told
[43:06] the disciples he says the son of man is
[43:08] going to go into Jerusalem and he's
[43:10] going to be crucified and killed in a
[43:11] third day he rise amen and Peter says
[43:13] far be it from thee for a thing like
[43:15] that to happen to thee amen Peter didn't
[43:18] want Jesus to go anywhere none of the
[43:19] disciples wanted him to go anywhere and
[43:22] even Jesus didn't want In the Flesh to
[43:24] leave his disciples brother Birmingham
[43:25] said he was groaning and in travail and
[43:28] he was in in Gethsemane because he
[43:30] didn't want to leave the ones he loved
[43:33] but but
[43:36] true love
[43:38] sacrifices self for the benefit of the
[43:41] loved
[43:42] but I'm going to go one step further if
[43:44] you'll allow me to
[43:46] true love will allow the love to suffer
[43:53] for the greater good of the loved
[43:57] we're going the next step
[43:59] so now true love will sacrifice self for
[44:02] the love for the object of their love
[44:04] perverted love will sacrifice the object
[44:07] of the love for themselves but now true
[44:09] love will go one step further true love
[44:12] will allow the suffering of the loved
[44:15] for the benefit of the love
[44:18] not for the benefit of the Lover now
[44:20] this isn't perverted love this is true
[44:22] love
[44:22] and true love will permit suffering for
[44:25] the object of their affection because it
[44:29] benefits the object of their affection
[44:34] now this comes home this is how we
[44:36] discern true love
[44:38] because sometimes when love is being
[44:42] manifest in a human way it doesn't look
[44:44] like love
[44:45] but it's perfect love not human love and
[44:48] it gets all confused in our mind and
[44:51] Twisted by emotions people said if you
[44:53] really love them how can you do that and
[44:54] let this happen and how can you take
[44:56] that action amen but true love will take
[44:59] the action that's most beneficial to the
[45:01] one love even if it causes the one who's
[45:04] loved to suffer
[45:06] that's true love that's God's love
[45:09] that's what God does
[45:11] so the love truly we love like God loves
[45:14] God is love so the definition of Love Is
[45:17] God so we want to know how love acts
[45:20] let's see what God did All Through the
[45:22] Bible and that's love
[45:26] so Jesus says
[45:28] nevertheless I tell you truth it's
[45:29] expedient
[45:31] for you
[45:32] that I go away
[45:34] it's for your best interest that I leave
[45:37] you and they're all saying don't leave
[45:38] us don't leave us where are you going to
[45:40] go why can't we follow this isn't going
[45:42] to happen to you and Peter so much
[45:44] didn't want him to go that Peter took
[45:46] out a sword and tried to kill a man amen
[45:48] to stop Jesus from leaving him
[45:51] Peter didn't want him to go anywhere
[45:53] none of the disciples want him to go
[45:55] anywhere nobody heard him say this and
[45:56] say oh good something good is coming our
[45:59] way
[46:01] they were going to go through a trial
[46:02] through a bit of suffering they were
[46:04] going to go through anguish and
[46:06] confusion and distress
[46:08] when he separated from them
[46:10] but he said it's expedient for you that
[46:12] I go away by going on away the comforter
[46:14] will not come unto you and that is going
[46:18] to be for your greater good
[46:22] brother remember said in the message I
[46:24] know
[46:25] and why does God let trouble
[46:28] come
[46:30] God harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[46:33] mouth and makes it obey him
[46:35] and those troubles bring us into a
[46:37] closer fellowship with God
[46:40] there had been no rainbow until the
[46:42] flood came but after Noah was pressed
[46:44] into that condition that he was in to
[46:46] float 40 days and nights in a storm the
[46:48] little Ark pitching up and down in the
[46:50] water it was after the flood was over
[46:52] that he saw the rainbow for its first
[46:54] time
[46:54] the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of
[46:56] Promise after he'd went through the
[46:58] tribulation then he saw the promise
[47:01] that's the way you see the Promise after
[47:03] you've gone through the tribulation I've
[47:05] liked that poem or Psalm must I be
[47:07] carried home to heaven on a flowery bed
[47:09] of ease While others fought to win the
[47:11] prize and sailed through bloody Seas
[47:13] we ask for comfort and peace
[47:16] God gives us the best he could give us
[47:18] trials and tribulations that's better
[47:22] than comfort and peace
[47:25] our Comforts is just beyond the river
[47:31] why does God let troubles come
[47:34] that's what we say every time we get in
[47:36] trouble
[47:38] God what are you doing why is this
[47:39] happening to me
[47:41] amen but but brother explains to us in
[47:44] the church age book or this is the
[47:46] message I know but it's again in the
[47:47] church age book that that God Amen
[47:51] permits troubles because God is behind
[47:53] the trouble
[47:55] working something for our benefit so
[47:58] pure love true love will allow the
[48:02] suffering of the object of love for the
[48:04] benefit of the object of love
[48:06] not for the benefit of the lover
[48:08] for the benefit of the object of love
[48:10] this isn't a perverted love it's a true
[48:13] love
[48:14] this is why when you see a parent who
[48:17] doesn't want to discipline their child
[48:19] doesn't want to correct the child
[48:20] doesn't ever want to tell them no spoils
[48:22] a child and gives them everything they
[48:24] want that's not love
[48:26] that's not love
[48:28] and and many times or you do it this way
[48:31] you say uh uh a mother or father is
[48:34] correcting a grandchild and Grandma amen
[48:37] says no you're not you're not doing that
[48:38] in my house takes and coddles the child
[48:40] says you can do that here and huddles
[48:42] the child and sweeps them off to the
[48:43] other room and gets him a piece of candy
[48:45] and says Grandma loves you Grandma does
[48:47] not love that child
[48:49] she loves the child with a perverted
[48:51] love because Grandma's heart hurts too
[48:54] bad to see the child corrected and
[48:56] doesn't want the child to cry amen or
[48:58] have to suffer in any way and so will
[49:00] not allow suffering for the betterment
[49:03] of the child meaning now that Grandma is
[49:06] in a perverted love
[49:09] does that make sense
[49:11] but true love which would allow Grandma
[49:14] to suffer the heartache
[49:17] of of seeing discipline and seeing
[49:20] retribution seeing the cycle go through
[49:23] to being a better character and
[49:24] self-control and the grandchild because
[49:26] it's better for the grandchild in the
[49:28] long run that would be true love true
[49:30] love would allow Grandma to suffer her
[49:33] filial feelings for agape love
[49:37] amen
[49:38] so now we can start to see this love is
[49:40] a much higher love
[49:42] Than This Feeling emotional love the
[49:45] feeling emotional love amen is always
[49:47] for the benefit of the lover
[49:50] but agape love is for the benefit of the
[49:52] one who's loved
[49:55] amen
[49:56] so
[49:58] God we say we ask for comfort and peace
[50:02] we ask for comfort and peace
[50:05] and God gives us the best thing to give
[50:06] us trials and tribulations that's that's
[50:08] not comfort and peace we ask for comfort
[50:10] and peace but he gives us trials and
[50:12] tribulations why because trials and
[50:14] tribulations are better than comfort and
[50:16] peace
[50:17] so what is it we need we need character
[50:19] we we need to learn about God we need to
[50:22] understand the word and some of those
[50:23] things only come by trials and
[50:25] tribulation and God will allow us to
[50:28] suffer
[50:30] because of love
[50:34] how could he allow suffering if he loves
[50:36] us he allows suffering because he loves
[50:38] us
[50:42] amen
[50:44] so sometimes it's difficult to discern
[50:47] true love because of the emotions
[50:51] it gets all tangled up
[50:54] I want to read two places and and the
[50:57] Old Testament in Exodus 13. let's look
[50:59] there
[51:07] Exodus 13.
[51:10] and 17.
[51:18] Exodus 13 and 17 says and it came to
[51:21] pass when Pharaoh had let the people go
[51:23] that God LED them not through the way of
[51:25] the land of the Philistines although it
[51:27] was near
[51:28] for God said less per eventure the
[51:30] people repent when they see war and they
[51:32] return to Egypt but God led the people
[51:34] about through the way of the Wilderness
[51:36] of the Red Sea and the children of
[51:37] Israel went up harnessed out of the land
[51:39] of Egypt
[51:40] so now there was a very short route to
[51:44] Palestine
[51:45] to the promised land
[51:47] but God didn't take him on the short
[51:49] easy route because God knew that if they
[51:52] went the short easy route they could see
[51:54] War too early and be discouraged so God
[51:57] took him on a much more difficult route
[52:00] and he moved them by way of the Red Sea
[52:02] where they would get pinned in and
[52:03] trapped
[52:05] then he would open up the Red Sea and
[52:07] bring him across then they would get
[52:08] into the Wilderness amen where their
[52:10] bread would run out and then he would
[52:11] provide bread then they would come to
[52:12] where their water ran out and then he
[52:14] would provide water he took them in a
[52:16] much more difficult path than the easy
[52:18] path right across the top skirting right
[52:20] around the Mediterranean Sea and going
[52:22] right into Palestine and you think God
[52:24] can do anything he wants he could just
[52:25] blow him away and move no God God is
[52:28] always doing what's best for the ones he
[52:30] loves
[52:32] so they wouldn't be discouraged before
[52:33] he moves them around and now what's he
[52:36] doing he's taking them by a harder way
[52:38] because the harder way he keeps
[52:40] reinforcing I'm with you I'm covering
[52:42] for you I'm parting the sea I'm feeding
[52:44] you I'm giving you water why well how
[52:47] did they know I mean how did they see
[52:49] God manifesting not through the easy
[52:51] route but through the hard route
[52:53] and the hard route gave God the
[52:55] opportunity to continually manifest his
[52:58] love
[52:59] manifests is protection and provision
[53:02] and Care amen was manifested in the
[53:04] harder way amen we wonder sometimes why
[53:06] is my life always the harder way amen
[53:09] because God has something better for you
[53:11] and I
[53:12] not the easy way it seems like life's so
[53:15] easy for some amen so hard for others
[53:17] amen give me the way that God has chose
[53:20] because the way that God has chose is
[53:22] for my benefit
[53:23] because his love is always for the
[53:26] benefit of the one who's loved
[53:28] he's not he's not mad at us he's not
[53:31] punishing us he's not trying to kill us
[53:36] but he's bringing us into perfection
[53:39] and he's showing himself Mighty on our
[53:40] behalf all the way along let's go to
[53:43] Judges chapter 3 now
[53:48] Judges chapter 3
[53:53] chapter 3 verse 1.
[53:59] Judges chapter 3 verse 1 now these are
[54:02] the Nations which the Lord left
[54:05] the Lord left some Nations
[54:07] he didn't run them all out
[54:09] these are the Nations which the Lord
[54:11] left to prove Israel by them even as
[54:13] many of Israel as had not known all the
[54:16] wars of Canaan only that the generations
[54:18] of the children of Israel might know to
[54:21] teach them War at the least such as
[54:23] before knew nothing thereof
[54:26] God did not allow all the inhabitants to
[54:31] be driven out and bring them into a
[54:33] perfect peace with no more war but he
[54:36] left behind
[54:37] some Nations that would continually
[54:40] fight with the children of Israel so
[54:42] that when the next Generation came up
[54:44] the Next Generation amen wouldn't
[54:47] wouldn't be devoid of character and
[54:49] understanding of how to war
[54:51] so he left enough trouble in the
[54:54] promised land so that the Next
[54:55] Generation knew how to fight
[54:58] [Music]
[55:00] what is this brother Ted this is love
[55:03] This Is Love
[55:05] amen
[55:07] oh my goodness
[55:09] I think so many times uh when we when we
[55:13] begin to parent we we there's such a
[55:16] picture of parenting in the world that
[55:18] is not the right kind of parenting
[55:20] but if you want to be a Godly parent see
[55:23] how God is as a parent and mimic God
[55:27] so God is a father amen and you see you
[55:31] see a modern society where where people
[55:35] amen are not able to cope with anything
[55:37] amen they're not able to cope mentally
[55:39] they're not they don't have any
[55:41] understanding because they have never
[55:43] suffered there's but the the attempt has
[55:45] been to eliminate as much suffering as
[55:47] possible
[55:49] and and you know what I'm guilty of the
[55:52] same I really don't want my children to
[55:54] suffer
[55:55] I'm not trying to make them suffer
[55:57] but I can go overboard in my feelio love
[56:00] and try to to do everything for them and
[56:03] require them never to work never to
[56:05] contribute to the family never to take
[56:07] out the trash make their bed empty the
[56:09] dishes
[56:11] dig in the garden they always get to eat
[56:14] the tomatoes but nobody ever dug the
[56:15] weeds
[56:18] but you see this is the society this is
[56:19] where Society has gone and now kids get
[56:22] trophies for competing not for women
[56:26] so they don't have to labor and strive
[56:28] and work hard and overcome they don't
[56:30] have to overcome themselves they don't
[56:32] have to build up a resilience because
[56:33] they're getting a trophy anyways
[56:36] they get Advanced whether they're worth
[56:38] worthy of advancement or not amen they
[56:40] get passes at work because everybody's
[56:41] so desperate to have employees they can
[56:43] show up late they can miss days they're
[56:45] not going to get fired because they need
[56:47] warm bodies the whole thing is set up in
[56:49] the wrong kind of love amen and it is
[56:52] destroyed an entire generation
[56:55] and now because there's been no
[56:58] struggling because there's there's been
[57:01] no labor there's been no effort in fact
[57:03] there's been so much Prosperity amen
[57:06] that children have been given everything
[57:07] amen and it's even a Temptation for us
[57:09] to shower upon our children gifts and
[57:11] things and things they like there's
[57:13] nothing funner than knowing that your
[57:15] son or daughter really would love to
[57:16] have this thing and you secretly go get
[57:18] it and you surprise them with it and
[57:19] there's nothing wrong with that but the
[57:21] problem is if you've never made them go
[57:23] labor to earn some money to pay for it
[57:25] themselves you do them a travesty
[57:27] because when they leave home they have
[57:28] no understanding of what it's like
[57:31] and you didn't love them in loving them
[57:34] all their life you never loved them
[57:37] because everything came easy everything
[57:39] mom and dad took care of it they did it
[57:41] all amen then you have people who get
[57:43] married they don't know how to fill out
[57:44] documentation they can't go to the bank
[57:46] they can't open accounts they can't
[57:47] balance a checkbook they can't
[57:51] that's not love
[57:53] that's not love
[57:55] but love is saying you know what life
[57:58] isn't easy when you get away from Mom
[58:00] and Dad you're going to need to know
[58:01] some of these things now we're going to
[58:03] get up early Saturday morning that was
[58:05] my routine Saturday morning amen my dad
[58:08] would shake me out of bed
[58:09] way early to pick green beans
[58:13] and I hated green beans
[58:15] I mean they tasted all right but the
[58:17] ones in the garden I hated
[58:19] because it's Saturday morning and he
[58:21] loved to do it super early before it got
[58:23] hot because my dad didn't want to sweat
[58:25] a drop picking green bean so we'd be up
[58:27] there as soon as the sun was peeking
[58:29] Over the Horizon so it was still cool
[58:31] picking green beans on Saturday morning
[58:33] amen and and I I hated the whole process
[58:37] I didn't enjoy it I didn't like being in
[58:38] the garden with Dad I had no warm fuzzy
[58:40] feelings
[58:42] but today I'm thankful that I had a dad
[58:44] that would shake me out of bed and make
[58:46] me pick green beans
[58:48] and not let me lay there and says he
[58:49] loved me letting me sleep in
[58:52] that's not love
[58:54] you're setting them up for Destruction
[58:57] you're setting them up for a surprise
[59:00] and now these these young people that
[59:03] have never suffered never labored never
[59:05] worked amen never really had any they
[59:07] really never had anything they really
[59:09] had to strive to obtain
[59:12] and because of that they're going crazy
[59:14] they're losing their minds they cannot
[59:16] COPE in this world Amen because there's
[59:19] something so backwards about it amen
[59:22] here's the issue you're never going to
[59:24] take away suffering
[59:26] suffering is a part of human life so if
[59:28] you take away natural suffering Here
[59:30] Comes mental suffering and now the
[59:32] mental disease is on a rampage
[59:34] where people don't know what gender they
[59:36] are they don't they can't cope they
[59:38] can't deal with anything somebody makes
[59:40] fun of them on social media and they
[59:42] want to commit suicide
[59:45] it's like are you kidding me somebody
[59:46] laughed at your shirt and you want to
[59:48] kill yourself
[59:49] why and to them it's real I listen to
[59:52] not pretend
[59:53] because you're never going to get
[59:55] through life without suffering
[59:59] so this this doing everything for our
[1:00:02] children and providing everything they
[1:00:04] ever need and never require it doesn't
[1:00:06] matter how much money you have amen you
[1:00:08] can be sitting on a couple million
[1:00:10] dollars in the bank amen and it'll still
[1:00:12] do them good to go get a job cutting
[1:00:14] somebody else's grass and pulling
[1:00:16] somebody else's weed to buy the bicycle
[1:00:18] they want
[1:00:19] and that'll be more love than you doing
[1:00:22] it
[1:00:25] because true love is always for the
[1:00:29] benefit of the one loved
[1:00:33] and I know
[1:00:35] that my children are going to have to
[1:00:37] make it without me someday
[1:00:41] I'm not always going to be here to cover
[1:00:43] for all their mistakes
[1:00:45] I won't always be here to get them out
[1:00:48] of trouble I won't always be here to
[1:00:50] provide for their needs I I won't always
[1:00:52] be here and even at that as they get
[1:00:54] older some of their needs to go far
[1:00:55] beyond my capabilities
[1:00:58] so love will take him as children and
[1:01:00] teach them the character they need and
[1:01:02] this self-discipline and character and
[1:01:05] work ethic and and all the things that
[1:01:08] they need to make it in life
[1:01:10] so this whole modern idea of love is not
[1:01:13] love amen and then and then when you
[1:01:16] really uh have your children working I
[1:01:19] mean it's almost like your neighbors
[1:01:20] think you're running a concentration
[1:01:21] camp
[1:01:25] like how can you do that and I mean they
[1:01:27] just want to play and you work them so
[1:01:28] hard and you're and you're thinking you
[1:01:31] know let's just teleport back 150 years
[1:01:33] and see what life was like
[1:01:36] working in the garden for two hours on
[1:01:38] Saturday is not hard work I mean
[1:01:43] kids were being sent to the mines at
[1:01:45] nine years old
[1:01:46] 150 years ago maybe even less than that
[1:01:50] so
[1:01:52] we realize the perversion of love
[1:01:56] complicates everything but real genuine
[1:01:59] love
[1:02:00] is always focused on what's best for the
[1:02:03] object of love
[1:02:06] amen what why does God let troubles come
[1:02:09] God harnesses troubles puts bits in his
[1:02:11] mouth makes it obey him because those
[1:02:13] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:02:15] fellowship with him
[1:02:20] the troubles are beneficial
[1:02:24] this is why brother Ben says you can't
[1:02:27] help a chicken pip its way out of the
[1:02:29] egg
[1:02:31] if you help it you'll kill it
[1:02:34] he said but oh my heart is breaking it's
[1:02:38] working so hard it's getting exhausted
[1:02:40] and look it's going as a little big I
[1:02:42] can see it's just coming through it's
[1:02:43] not coming through but oh I want to help
[1:02:45] it oh I want to help it
[1:02:49] the question is what's better for the
[1:02:52] chick
[1:02:53] for it to struggle to survive or for you
[1:02:57] to take away the struggle for survival
[1:03:00] but you can't hardly stand to watch it
[1:03:03] struggle
[1:03:05] which means Who Do You Love More the
[1:03:07] chicken or yourself
[1:03:11] you love yourself the most
[1:03:14] you say my my son came back from work
[1:03:17] the other day went and worked for the
[1:03:19] for the neighbor and he come back and
[1:03:20] the poor little thing had blisters on
[1:03:22] his fingers I can't stand to see those
[1:03:24] blisters on his fingers
[1:03:27] he's trying to save up my I'll just buy
[1:03:29] him the bike I can't stand
[1:03:31] do you love the boy or do you love
[1:03:33] yourself
[1:03:34] because you don't want to see you don't
[1:03:36] want to endure you don't want to feel
[1:03:37] that bad feeling you don't want to see
[1:03:39] the struggle you don't want to witness
[1:03:41] the hardship
[1:03:44] what about when they have a problem at
[1:03:46] work when they're 16 or 17 years old and
[1:03:48] they've got something they need to sort
[1:03:49] out amen at work and you can advise them
[1:03:52] on how to handle it or you can March in
[1:03:54] there yourself and tell that manager
[1:03:56] what you think
[1:04:00] which is better for the 16 17 year old
[1:04:04] for them to learn with your counsel give
[1:04:06] them good Godly counsel and let them go
[1:04:08] in and face the issue and work their way
[1:04:10] through it and maybe have a
[1:04:11] misunderstanding maybe have a repeat
[1:04:13] conversation and may go well may go bad
[1:04:16] but it's better for them amen that they
[1:04:18] deal with the situation then you march
[1:04:20] in and take care of it all
[1:04:22] what we'll end up doing is handicapping
[1:04:25] people
[1:04:26] so then I mean you could even take it
[1:04:28] into church you hear an instance of
[1:04:30] church discipline somebody was
[1:04:31] disciplined in the church and put out a
[1:04:33] fellowship oh how could you do that how
[1:04:35] could you have the love of God
[1:04:39] right and then all of a sudden family
[1:04:41] will come to coddle and and they'll wind
[1:04:43] up in another church and that church
[1:04:44] will bring them in and accept them
[1:04:46] that's not love
[1:04:48] now that doesn't mean all church
[1:04:49] discipline was correct and and there's
[1:04:51] not ground for that but but we have to
[1:04:53] understand true love what is true love
[1:04:56] true love as true compassion is to do
[1:04:59] the will of God and his will is his word
[1:05:01] amen and it's not loving to people to
[1:05:04] let people violate the word of God and
[1:05:06] do nothing about it
[1:05:08] that's not love
[1:05:12] but love would be and when Paul talks
[1:05:15] about church discipline he said when you
[1:05:17] gather together my spirit with is with
[1:05:19] you deliver such a one to the devil for
[1:05:22] the destruction of the flesh that the
[1:05:24] soul might be saved what's Paul
[1:05:26] interested in
[1:05:27] he's interested in the one he loves
[1:05:31] in the soul
[1:05:34] but then human emotion comes creeping in
[1:05:36] and starts tangling this web
[1:05:39] and how could you be loving how can you
[1:05:40] say you have the love of God and don't
[1:05:42] you know there's extenuating
[1:05:43] circumstances and this that and the
[1:05:45] other why don't why don't we just Flex
[1:05:48] the word to fit the situation that's not
[1:05:50] love
[1:05:52] that is not love
[1:05:54] love would be say you know what brother
[1:05:57] sister I love you but this is the word
[1:05:59] and we can't change it for nobody
[1:06:05] that's love
[1:06:08] so so many things
[1:06:10] get perverted
[1:06:12] and questioned
[1:06:14] but we need to look at the word of God
[1:06:16] and the word of God
[1:06:17] shows us the way
[1:06:19] brother man said in the message uniting
[1:06:21] time and sign he said so tension
[1:06:24] I think what is this tension brother
[1:06:26] Brandon was all tore up one day he's got
[1:06:29] this nervous thing that comes back to
[1:06:30] him he's all tense and he's and he's
[1:06:32] he's having another problem with his
[1:06:34] nerves again it was coming in cycles and
[1:06:37] he's talking about all this and he's
[1:06:38] been in prayer about it and he says what
[1:06:40] is this tension
[1:06:42] if I could have been born without this
[1:06:44] tension this is what he's thinking
[1:06:46] well if I wouldn't have had this tension
[1:06:49] I wouldn't have been what I am
[1:06:52] I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps
[1:06:54] it was this tension that drove me to
[1:06:56] Jesus Christ it's been a blessing thing
[1:06:59] to me
[1:07:02] this thing that troubled the prophet of
[1:07:04] God all his life this this this nervous
[1:07:07] tension this upset stomach the thing
[1:07:10] that took him off the field that would
[1:07:11] come amen and cycle through his life
[1:07:13] seven times and on the eighth time and
[1:07:15] God would finally deliver him from him
[1:07:17] but it troubled him so much and caused
[1:07:19] so much discomfort amen he went to
[1:07:21] multiple doctors to try to get it fixed
[1:07:22] went to Mayo Clinic went to somebody in
[1:07:24] Indiana to get a scope and he tried all
[1:07:26] these things and he comes down here in
[1:07:29] 1963 and he says this tension what would
[1:07:32] I be without this tension amen I
[1:07:34] wouldn't be what I am maybe if perhaps I
[1:07:36] wouldn't be a Christian it was this
[1:07:38] tension that drove me to Christ
[1:07:40] it's a blessed thing to me
[1:07:43] amen whatever God has in our life
[1:07:46] whatever situation we find ourselves in
[1:07:48] whether it's a family situation a
[1:07:51] marriage situation A a physical
[1:07:53] limitation a financial limitation I can
[1:07:56] say whatever God has allowed us for my
[1:07:58] benefit wherever I find myself is where
[1:08:01] I need to be because God's love has
[1:08:04] foresaw what I need
[1:08:07] that's right
[1:08:08] remember that he makes even our mistakes
[1:08:10] work together for his perfect will
[1:08:12] so even those mistakes that landed me in
[1:08:14] this situation amen it causes me to have
[1:08:16] a greater love and need for God Amen
[1:08:19] there's good things that can come from
[1:08:20] it let's go to a second Corinthians
[1:08:23] chapter 12. let me just read just a
[1:08:25] couple more scriptures as we wind down
[1:08:37] I'll say
[1:08:39] talking about my dad and the green beans
[1:08:44] I remember my dad was a truck driver all
[1:08:47] my life he drove a truck when the guys
[1:08:49] talked about my dad's this my dad's that
[1:08:51] I wasn't standing in line to confess
[1:08:53] what my dad was
[1:08:54] I wasn't the first one to pipe off my
[1:08:56] dad's a truck driver
[1:08:57] because some had lawyers for dads I went
[1:08:59] to a school that was kind of it was
[1:09:01] Springboro high school and there's a lot
[1:09:03] of lawyers and professionals and things
[1:09:04] like that
[1:09:05] and I'd see my dad put on an old work
[1:09:07] uniform and it was ugly as all get out
[1:09:10] green pants and a brown shirt with his
[1:09:12] name on it and tag and all this and he
[1:09:14] put on an old pair of boots and I watch
[1:09:16] him over and over lace up those boots
[1:09:18] and my dad uh
[1:09:22] he wasn't a sophisticated man in any way
[1:09:24] he was just a regular Regular Guy
[1:09:27] and this truck driving job would take
[1:09:29] him over the road so many days I
[1:09:30] wouldn't see my dad for three or four
[1:09:31] days at a time he'd work off shifts and
[1:09:33] all that and so it was really disruptive
[1:09:36] but when I got to be married and I got a
[1:09:39] job and I put on a uniform and I laced
[1:09:41] up my boots every morning to go out to
[1:09:43] work I thank God that I had an example
[1:09:46] that I watched over and over and saw
[1:09:48] what it means to love your family
[1:09:51] I didn't have some odd concept or some
[1:09:54] foreign idea I had witnessed that I had
[1:09:56] seen it and I become thankful for it and
[1:09:57] I was thankful for a dad
[1:09:59] and you know like I said my dad wasn't
[1:10:02] sophisticated or elegant so dad's way of
[1:10:04] telling you were wrong is knock it off
[1:10:05] knucklehead why are you so stupid
[1:10:10] I mean if that was going on in 2023 I'd
[1:10:12] need therapy and counseling
[1:10:15] I'd probably be on medication
[1:10:18] right
[1:10:20] but
[1:10:23] he was right
[1:10:25] and I'm thankful he was right and I'm
[1:10:27] thankful he told me
[1:10:28] it could have been smoother it could
[1:10:30] have been a little sweeter he could have
[1:10:32] had a nicer tone he could have used more
[1:10:33] positively reinforcing words
[1:10:37] point is I got the message and I'm
[1:10:39] standing here today thanking God that I
[1:10:41] had a father who would correct me like
[1:10:43] the Bible says we thank God that we had
[1:10:45] fathers who had correct us and they did
[1:10:47] for their own pleasure now the father
[1:10:48] God will correct us for our benefit
[1:10:51] but I'm so thankful that I had a dad who
[1:10:53] would give that example who who would
[1:10:55] show true love amen and tell me to knock
[1:10:57] it off knucklehead
[1:11:00] not the most sensitive way not really
[1:11:02] the way I want to say to my children but
[1:11:04] listen he got the point across and I'm
[1:11:07] standing here today saying thank God I
[1:11:09] love my dad and my dad loved me
[1:11:13] that's what we need more of
[1:11:15] more just somebody who's willing to
[1:11:19] extend themselves or somebody else be
[1:11:21] honest take some take responsibility for
[1:11:24] something and tell it like it is
[1:11:28] second Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:11:32] verse 7.
[1:11:37] unless I should be exalted above measure
[1:11:40] through the abundance of the revelations
[1:11:41] that were given to me a thorn in the
[1:11:44] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[1:11:46] me lest I should be exalted above
[1:11:48] measure for this thing I besought the
[1:11:50] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[1:11:52] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:11:54] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:11:56] made perfect in weakness
[1:11:58] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:12:00] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:12:02] of Christ May rest upon me
[1:12:05] here's the Apostle Paul beloved of the
[1:12:07] Lord
[1:12:08] First Church eighth messenger
[1:12:10] and God will allow a messenger of Satan
[1:12:13] to Buffet him with a thorn in the flesh
[1:12:16] that he sought the Lord three times to
[1:12:18] remove and God said he wouldn't
[1:12:20] and Paul recognizes because of the
[1:12:23] abundance of Revelation a messenger of
[1:12:27] Satan a thorn was sent to buff at me
[1:12:28] unless I be exalted above measure
[1:12:32] God was not punishing Paul for anything
[1:12:34] Paul done wrong God was allowing an
[1:12:38] Affliction to Paul because Paul was
[1:12:40] given an abundance of Revelation and
[1:12:41] without this Affliction he could have
[1:12:43] been over evaluated puffed up lifted up
[1:12:47] beyond measure
[1:12:49] so the love of God allowed the
[1:12:52] Affliction to keep Paul right with God
[1:12:55] so that Paul would finish his journey
[1:12:56] right
[1:13:00] oh thank God that's love
[1:13:03] that's God's love that's the right kind
[1:13:05] of love
[1:13:08] Luke 22
[1:13:12] let's go to Luke 22.
[1:13:22] Luke 22.
[1:13:29] Luke 22 31.
[1:13:35] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[1:13:37] Satan hath desired to have you that he
[1:13:40] may sift you as wheat
[1:13:42] but I've prayed for thee that thy faith
[1:13:44] failed not
[1:13:45] when thou art converted strengthen the
[1:13:47] brethren
[1:13:52] listen I I hope you don't believe I'm
[1:13:54] reading too much into this scripture but
[1:13:55] he says Satan hath desired to have you
[1:13:58] then he may sift you as wheat
[1:14:00] it looks to me like he was granted
[1:14:03] permission
[1:14:06] you have to say is that the love of God
[1:14:10] Satan is desire to sift you as we well
[1:14:12] Jesus tell him no
[1:14:14] tell him he can't
[1:14:18] Satan has desired he's asked he's
[1:14:21] expressed the desire
[1:14:23] to sift you as wheat
[1:14:25] well that's easy Jesus tell him he can't
[1:14:28] tell him I'm under your special
[1:14:29] protection and he doesn't have a right
[1:14:32] no Jesus doesn't say that
[1:14:35] she said but I've prayed for you
[1:14:37] that your faith fell not
[1:14:39] right and when you're converted you're
[1:14:42] going to have to go through a dark time
[1:14:46] and this is just me
[1:14:48] but maybe because you're a little too
[1:14:50] proud Peter
[1:14:52] maybe because you're a little too
[1:14:53] self-confident
[1:14:54] and you think you'll never fail and
[1:14:56] you'll never know though all men leave
[1:14:59] you and forsake you I'll not forsake you
[1:15:02] and maybe Peter you're just a little
[1:15:04] self too confident and you got just a
[1:15:07] little too much boldness and you got a
[1:15:09] little too much of a an evaluation of
[1:15:12] yourself maybe you need to be sifted a
[1:15:14] little bit but don't worry I've prayed
[1:15:16] for you and when you're converted
[1:15:18] you're going to get converted but you've
[1:15:20] got to pass through this because you
[1:15:23] need to come to a repentance and a
[1:15:25] Brokenness and a humility amen but Jesus
[1:15:27] is going to come right around and
[1:15:29] restore him amen you're going to restore
[1:15:30] him by the Sea of tiberias Amen he's
[1:15:32] going to ask him three times does thou
[1:15:34] love me does thou love me does thou love
[1:15:36] me there's a restoration coming but
[1:15:37] there's a need that you're broken
[1:15:39] there's a need that that something
[1:15:41] transpires in your life people
[1:15:44] Satan has desire to sift you like wheat
[1:15:46] but I've prayed for you
[1:15:52] all those times we've been sifted
[1:15:54] friends
[1:15:55] that wasn't a bad thing
[1:15:57] that's been a good thing
[1:15:59] all the difficult circumstances what
[1:16:01] have they done difficulty after
[1:16:02] difficulty trial after trial what has it
[1:16:05] done I don't know what it's done for you
[1:16:06] but for me it's caused me to look deeper
[1:16:09] inside and deeper inside and I realize
[1:16:11] there's more selfishness there there's
[1:16:12] too much of Chad I'm too proud too
[1:16:14] arrogant too self-focused
[1:16:18] and what it does it makes me want to I
[1:16:20] every trial every difficult
[1:16:22] circumstances makes me trust myself less
[1:16:26] I think I've told you before I'm not
[1:16:28] afraid of other people the one who's the
[1:16:31] one human being who scares me to death
[1:16:32] is me
[1:16:36] this is the one who causes all the
[1:16:38] problems this is the guy who's always
[1:16:40] getting in God's way this is the guy who
[1:16:42] sometimes thinks he knows something
[1:16:43] about it
[1:16:45] the one who scares me to death is me
[1:16:50] so God has ways
[1:16:52] of allowing us to continue to mistrust
[1:16:54] ourselves
[1:16:56] and not have an over evaluated an
[1:16:59] estimation of ourselves he allows us to
[1:17:01] fall once in a while and bump our nose
[1:17:02] and skin up our knee so that we realize
[1:17:04] God I truly can do nothing without you
[1:17:07] and friends that's love
[1:17:10] that's love not the not the not the the
[1:17:14] the him to put such a bubble around you
[1:17:16] that nothing ever happened to you so you
[1:17:17] can continue to think that you're great
[1:17:19] and special and you're overcoming and
[1:17:21] you've got all ability and might and
[1:17:22] Power
[1:17:24] Sometimes the best thing he can do is
[1:17:25] leave you to your own devices for a few
[1:17:27] minutes and let you crash and burn amen
[1:17:29] so that you come to the realization I'm
[1:17:31] nothing without you I can do nothing
[1:17:34] to me that's love
[1:17:37] that's real love
[1:17:39] brother Graham tells the story I
[1:17:41] mentioned it last time but I'm going to
[1:17:42] read it here out of the message the Good
[1:17:44] Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:17:46] he's talking to a shepherd and he's
[1:17:48] relating a conversation he says why did
[1:17:51] you break its leg saw a sheep with a
[1:17:53] broken leg why did you break its leg are
[1:17:55] you a cruel Shepherd
[1:17:57] the shepherd had intentionally broken
[1:17:59] the Sheep's leg said are you a cruel
[1:18:01] Shepherd
[1:18:02] he said no I love the Sheep
[1:18:06] but the Sheep got to running away from
[1:18:08] me
[1:18:09] and he kept straying out to itself and I
[1:18:12] know the nature of sheep and I know that
[1:18:13] if they stray too far the wolf will get
[1:18:15] them
[1:18:16] so I had to break the Sheep's leg to
[1:18:19] keep it with me to draw it to my bosom
[1:18:21] to give it a little special food and
[1:18:25] it'll be and and I'll be so kind to it
[1:18:27] that when its leg gets well it'll never
[1:18:30] leave me anymore
[1:18:35] and sometimes his brother ends going on
[1:18:36] and sometimes God has to strike us down
[1:18:39] with sickness disease and affliction
[1:18:41] that he might just woo us to his bosom
[1:18:44] and give us a little Special Touch of
[1:18:46] his Divine resurrected power to prove
[1:18:48] that he's still the Lord Jesus and a man
[1:18:50] that's ever been healed of God knows
[1:18:52] what God is he won't want to stray
[1:18:55] um
[1:18:57] God is so good
[1:18:59] let's go to James chapter one and I'd
[1:19:01] like to finish with this scripture
[1:19:13] James chapter 1.
[1:19:19] verse 2.
[1:19:22] James 1 and 2. my brethren counted all
[1:19:26] joy
[1:19:27] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[1:19:30] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:19:32] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:19:35] have her perfect work that you may be
[1:19:38] perfect and entire and wanting nothing
[1:19:43] why does God let troubles come
[1:19:45] God harnesses trouble puts bits in his
[1:19:48] mouth it makes it obey him for those
[1:19:50] troubles bring us into a coaster
[1:19:52] Fellowship
[1:19:53] why does he let us make mistakes why how
[1:19:56] many times have you prayed God why did
[1:19:58] you let me do that
[1:19:59] you could have stopped me
[1:20:04] maybe there was something that you
[1:20:06] gained that was greater than what you
[1:20:08] lost
[1:20:10] maybe his love for Saul
[1:20:13] that you needed to lose some more Pride
[1:20:16] self-confidence
[1:20:18] needed to lose a little bit of religious
[1:20:20] spirit
[1:20:22] and maybe his Love Allowed a messenger
[1:20:25] of the devil to Buffet us a bit or maybe
[1:20:28] the devil assist us is weak and allowed
[1:20:30] us to make a mistake because we would
[1:20:32] come back to him having a greater
[1:20:34] understanding of what his love is
