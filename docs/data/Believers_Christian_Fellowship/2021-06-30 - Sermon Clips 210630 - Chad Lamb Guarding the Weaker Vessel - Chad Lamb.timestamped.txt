[0:00] you realize adam was not deceived adam
[0:03] was not the weaker vessel
[0:04] the woman was the weaker vessel she was
[0:07] deceived
[0:08] if adam had been standing there
[0:10] whispering in her ear she would have
[0:11] never fallen for the tactics of the
[0:13] devil
[0:15] she she was there alone facing the devil
[0:18] and the devil was attacking the word
[0:20] and by reasoning she began to reason by
[0:22] the word and she come out from beyond
[0:24] the boundary of the word
[0:25] and then she was attacked and fell prey
[0:28] she was beguiled but adam was not
[0:32] deceived in the transgression
[0:34] so if adam would have been standing
[0:35] there whispering in her ear
[0:37] would she have fallen
[0:40] she fell because she had to open the
[0:42] door to release the attributes that were
[0:45] locked inside of gohan
[0:48] but god knew in the end time he would
[0:50] have one that wouldn't fall
[0:52] she's predestinated not to fall this one
[0:55] fell
[0:55] this one fell this one fell this one
[0:57] fell but there's one predestinated not
[0:59] to fall
[1:00] so how is he going to keep her from
[1:02] falling she's still the weaker vessel
[1:04] so what's he going to do he's going to
[1:06] do something different in this day
[1:08] he's going to come down himself with his
[1:10] personal presence and he's going to be
[1:12] standing
[1:13] not next to her but inside of her and
[1:15] he's going to be whispering love secrets
[1:17] to her
[1:17] and no matter what the devil brings he's
[1:19] got a love secret to fight against it
[1:22] he's opening the word you realize he's
[1:25] opening the word day by day
[1:26] service by service tape by tape he's
[1:29] opening what's he doing
[1:30] he's making the bride an invincible army
[1:33] not because she's got some super mind
[1:35] but she's under the headship of the word
[1:37] and under the headship of the word he's
[1:39] got to go through the word first to get
[1:41] to you
[1:41] and if you stay under the headship he's
[1:43] not going to get to you
[1:46] the only way is for the weaker vessel to
[1:49] forget that she's a weaker vessel
[1:53] and start to think she can reason the
[1:55] word
[1:57] and she can figure out she can do and
[2:00] she can begin to act like jezebel
[2:03] but this bride's predestinated
[2:06] not too
