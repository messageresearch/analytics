[0:00] we know that God has promised us if we
[0:03] pay tithes if we pay tithes that he
[0:06] promised the blessing that we can't
[0:07] contain and he'll prevent the Devourer
[0:09] from devouring
[0:11] we know that is that the promise
[0:14] but sometimes we see brothers or sisters
[0:17] they get into some difficulty some
[0:18] hardship maybe a financial situation
[0:21] amen and we may not realize that the
[0:24] Devourer has come because God has
[0:26] allowed it because they're not faithful
[0:28] in their tithes
[0:30] and we were simply one sympathy want to
[0:33] relieve the pressure on our brother and
[0:35] sister and so we keep funneling money
[0:37] and funneling money and funneling money
[0:39] because that's what we should do as
[0:41] loving people right we should not let
[0:42] anybody suffer amen we should take away
[0:44] all suffering we have means that take
[0:46] away all suffering but the problem is
[0:48] amen they're out of the will of God out
[0:51] of the word of God and all of my human
[0:53] compassion is never going to fix this
[0:55] problem there's an empty well that money
[0:58] will not fix because the problem is a
[1:00] spiritual problem they're off the word
[1:03] and I need to talk to them enough to
[1:06] realize Hey listen I think I understand
[1:08] what's going on Amen have you been
[1:11] paying your time well no I I got a
[1:13] little behind and I'm this and that and
[1:15] the other and and and and you know
[1:17] there's always a reason
[1:20] but there's never a good reason
[1:24] and so I could say oh yeah it's all
[1:26] right we understand and this and that
[1:28] and let me help out listen that's not
[1:30] help
[1:32] that's not love
[1:34] is to say listen brother sister I love
[1:37] you
[1:38] listen but the problem that I see is
[1:41] you're not lined up to the word if you
[1:42] get lined up to the word God has
[1:44] promised a blessing
[1:47] and I don't have the power within myself
[1:50] to override God's word
[1:53] and if I attempt to now my love oh I
[1:57] hope you understand now my love is evil
[2:02] now my love is wrong I'm in error I'm
[2:05] contrary to the word
[2:08] because of human compassion
[2:12] that doesn't mean we don't help people
[2:14] out my goodness we help people all the
[2:15] time we want to help people but but and
[2:17] there's times that there's help needed
[2:19] there's scriptures for that
[2:21] but
[2:22] oh God help us to help the right way
[2:26] help us to be loving help us to love our
[2:29] brothers the way God loved the Rich
[2:30] Young Ruler
[2:32] the way Jesus Christ loved him help us
[2:34] to love one another that would help us
[2:35] to have true genuine love of God in our
[2:38] hearts
[2:39] and not feel like that not feel like
[2:43] because we keep doing things that we're
[2:45] good
[2:47] we keep relieving pressures we keep
[2:49] handing out that listen we may be going
[2:52] absolutely contrary to the word of God
[2:54] in that amen we need some discernment we
[2:56] need God to lead us by spiritual
[2:58] leadership and maybe we need to ask some
[3:00] questions sometimes
[3:03] and give real love
[3:06] because real love
[3:09] true love will always bring us back to
[3:11] the word
[3:12] because true correction will always
[3:14] bring us back to the word and true love
[3:15] is corrective
