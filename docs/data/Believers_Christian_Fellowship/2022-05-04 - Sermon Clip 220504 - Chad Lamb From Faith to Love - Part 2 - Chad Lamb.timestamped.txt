[0:00] so what is that spirit that we received
[0:02] it's the spirit of adoption the spirit
[0:03] that will take us to adoption because
[0:05] we've been predestinated to the adoption
[0:07] of children by jesus christ so all these
[0:10] scriptures paint the same picture when
[0:12] we start talking about the virtues and
[0:14] we start talking about the statue of a
[0:15] perfect man if we don't set the
[0:17] foundation right in the word it can
[0:20] become a discouraging conversation
[0:22] because we begin to look at these
[0:23] virtues and say well i mean i've got to
[0:25] measure up to all of this and i've got
[0:27] to add to this to this to this to this
[0:30] but if we don't have the basis of
[0:32] understanding we can get discouraged
[0:34] when there's nothing discouraging in
[0:36] this doctrine whatsoever
[0:38] amen this message did not come to
[0:40] discourage us this message came to give
[0:41] us life this message didn't come to push
[0:44] us away it came to put us in position
[0:46] amen so everything in this message came
[0:49] to unlock our understanding to bring us
[0:52] into our rightful position so there's
[0:54] nothing discouraging in the message amen
[0:56] if the message is presented in a
[0:58] discouraging way it's the wrong ankle
[1:00] preached the wrong way amen and and
[1:03] trying to make you the wrong recipient
[1:05] amen but if you're the bride of jesus
[1:07] christ this message came to lift you up
[1:10] and to put you in position to manifest
[1:12] the life of jesus christ and that was
[1:14] according to his purpose and his will
[1:17] not your purpose and not your will so
[1:19] you've been predestinated to make it to
[1:22] the stature of a perfect man
[1:25] now that begins to flip the whole idea
[1:28] on its head and take it out of our
[1:29] carnal mind and it becomes an exciting
[1:32] doctrine because now this is me amen
[1:35] this is what i am this is who god wants
[1:37] me to be this is what i've been birthed
[1:40] on this earth to express amen it's all
[1:43] mine by these promises by these precious
[1:45] prominence i've been made a partaker of
[1:47] the divine nature so i can partake of
[1:49] this divine nature and become the very
[1:52] thing that i'm looking at and that was
[1:54] god's purpose from before the foundation
[1:56] of the world there's no discouragement
[1:58] here there's only encouragement saying
[2:01] this is you keep climbing amen this is
[2:03] you keep climbing where am i going to
[2:05] stop i'm not going to stop i'm going all
[2:07] the way to the top to express the full
[2:09] life of jesus christ because that's why
[2:12] i was put on this earth and that's why i
[2:14] was born again by the spirit of god
