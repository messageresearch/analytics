[5:42] that's good
[5:43] well
[5:45] always an honor and a privilege to come
[5:47] be with you for a little bit this
[5:48] evening i uh like always i have such a
[5:51] wonderful time
[5:52] walking with the lord with inspiration
[5:54] and then i get just nervous so bad it's
[5:56] amazing how many things you can think to
[5:59] say right brother on before you ever
[6:01] come to a pulpit and then it's amazing
[6:03] how your brain just goes blank and
[6:05] you're like i don't know what i would
[6:06] possibly say
[6:08] and so it's just an interesting thing so
[6:11] i've just uh i've had a wonderful time i
[6:14] do appreciate the opportunity the lord
[6:16] gives me to just spend that little time
[6:17] kind of close the world off you just
[6:19] shut the door you say hey let the world
[6:21] go by whatever happens happens i'm just
[6:24] shutting myself in with him for a little
[6:25] bit there's just nothing more more happy
[6:28] no other place i'd rather be
[6:30] than that so everybody feel good
[6:33] okay so if it's okay we're gonna it's a
[6:35] little bit of a different uh um i can
[6:37] tell i feel a little different today
[6:40] so it's a i like to do bible study if
[6:43] that's okay just something really simple
[6:44] i have a request from my daughter and
[6:46] she hates it when i say i i have
[6:48] anything you know she doesn't like the
[6:49] fact that i bring up her name she said
[6:51] daddy will you just preach something
[6:52] simple tonight and i says okay
[6:56] okay
[6:57] so i already had my subject before she
[6:59] said that nonetheless but uh it could be
[7:02] a little bit of a simple subject but
[7:03] it's something that gave me a lot of joy
[7:04] as i've been looking at it for the last
[7:06] couple days and just feeding on it and
[7:08] and i hope it can be a blessing to you
[7:11] is my prayer and i
[7:13] don't want to go long i know it's a
[7:14] wednesday night and everybody's maybe
[7:16] tired but
[7:18] there's just nothing that gives us more
[7:19] joy in life in the word
[7:21] so if you could turn in your bibles to
[7:24] revelations chapters 8.
[7:37] revelations chapters eight
[7:42] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[7:45] there was silence in heaven
[7:47] about the space of a half an hour
[7:50] and then the next
[7:52] verse first thessalonians
[7:55] 4 13
[7:57] i would not have you ignorant brethren
[7:58] concerning them which are asleep
[8:01] that you sorrow not even as others which
[8:03] have no hope
[8:04] for if we believe that jesus died and
[8:06] rose again even so them also which sleep
[8:10] in jesus will god bring with him
[8:12] for this we say unto you by the word of
[8:14] the lord that we which are alive and
[8:16] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[8:18] not prevent them which are asleep
[8:21] for the lord himself shall descend from
[8:24] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[8:26] the archangel and with the trump of god
[8:29] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[8:31] then we which are alive and remain shall
[8:33] be caught up together with them in the
[8:36] clouds
[8:37] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[8:40] we ever be with the lord
[8:42] wherefore comfort one another with these
[8:44] words
[8:45] if you will just bow your heads for a
[8:47] word of prayer
[8:50] heavenly father lord we just come before
[8:52] you lord this evening always with
[8:54] grateful hearts father
[8:56] lord it is our greatest honor and
[8:58] privilege to know that we have been
[9:00] called out by your grace
[9:02] and father the world is in darkness but
[9:04] your children are not in darkness father
[9:06] lord we are children of the light and we
[9:08] continue to press towards that light
[9:10] and father i just want to submit myself
[9:13] to you and the people tonight
[9:15] father would you come down and do those
[9:17] supernatural things that only you can do
[9:19] you can take an ignorant person like
[9:22] myself and you can use my lips and you
[9:24] could speak just those things that you
[9:26] want your children to know
[9:27] father i pray that you would do that and
[9:30] lord may you just encourage us one
[9:32] another father lord if there be any
[9:35] amongst us that's down father may you
[9:37] lift up their heads and may they be able
[9:40] to look up and realize their redemption
[9:42] hath drawn nigh
[9:43] father we sure love you we thank you for
[9:45] these opportunities
[9:47] we pray lord your blessings upon brother
[9:49] chad father as he travels home bring him
[9:51] home safely to us father lord may we be
[9:55] able to say like those that came from
[9:56] armas did not our hearts burn within us
[9:59] as he spoke to us along the way so
[10:02] father god continue to break the word
[10:04] and only the way that you can do it and
[10:06] lord open our eyes that we can see thee
[10:08] we love you we thank you in jesus name
[10:11] amen
[10:12] amen you may be seated
[10:16] i uh
[10:18] uh i have a little title for tonight um
[10:22] and i have a powerpoint so sorry i did i
[10:24] did put a powerpoint okay there there we
[10:26] go uh i have a little thought here
[10:28] tonight that i'd like to talk to you a
[10:30] little bit and kind of has happened by
[10:32] some different things that i've seen and
[10:34] some things that i ministered the last
[10:35] time that i was here and my title for
[10:38] tonight is into the light behind the
[10:40] veil
[10:41] into the light behind the veil
[10:43] and i i'm opening my scripture obviously
[10:46] with the seventh seal there was silence
[10:48] in heaven for about the space of a half
[10:50] an hour not a full half an hour but
[10:51] about the space of a half an hour and
[10:53] i'm bringing your attention to for to
[10:55] second thessalonians to shout the voice
[10:57] and the trumpet brother bam said he does
[10:59] all three while he is descending
[11:01] and so the reality of it that
[11:04] that we would be quickened we would be
[11:06] caught up
[11:07] at that time when he comes back
[11:09] and i am i i want to just start real
[11:12] slow and real simple to get to this
[11:14] thought
[11:15] and so here's where my my daughter gets
[11:17] her wish
[11:20] this is a very simple scripture that all
[11:21] of you know
[11:23] and i hope you know
[11:25] but i'm finding out that this is a
[11:26] vitally important scripture for us all
[11:30] in the day that we live in
[11:32] thy word is a lamp until i feet and a
[11:34] light unto my path
[11:36] pretty simple but the reality of it is
[11:38] the word is always shining the light in
[11:40] a few steps ahead of you and you must
[11:42] continue to walk in those few steps
[11:44] that's being right in front of you
[11:47] and the first john 1 5 says this then is
[11:50] the message which we have heard of him
[11:51] and declare unto you that god is light
[11:54] and in him is no darkness at all if we
[11:56] say that we have fellowship with him and
[11:58] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[12:00] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[12:02] is in the light we have fellowship one
[12:04] with another and the blood of jesus
[12:06] christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
[12:09] this is a basic scripture that you know
[12:12] also well
[12:13] this is i would say probably one of the
[12:15] most known scriptures i would say
[12:17] amongst message believers along with
[12:19] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[12:21] and forever
[12:23] so these two immutable scriptures that
[12:25] god never changes and the reality of it
[12:27] is he continually unveils himself and he
[12:30] continually is shining a bright and
[12:32] shining light and he expects and
[12:34] requires his children to consistently
[12:36] and constantly be walking in that light
[12:39] wherever that light continues to move
[12:42] and i begin to find that there's
[12:43] something that i realize there's there's
[12:45] quite a spirit to always want to just
[12:47] stop and find comfort and rest where you
[12:50] were and not continue to move where he
[12:53] is
[12:54] and um
[12:55] i uh oh well let's just keep going if
[12:57] that's okay and i'll say some other
[12:59] things here once we i lay some more
[13:00] foundation
[13:02] and feast of the trumpets brother braham
[13:04] says oh father if there's a person here
[13:07] this morning that just taken some
[13:09] superstition some theological influence
[13:11] or some theologian's word which is
[13:13] contrary to the word of god and they
[13:16] don't know the real christ the real holy
[13:18] spirit it isn't revealed to them the
[13:20] word yet
[13:21] oh oh how the word is to be in this day
[13:25] they see only a tradition they're living
[13:27] in the light that's blinding like the
[13:29] greatest robbery that has ever been done
[13:31] in the world was in england it was
[13:33] caused by a false light and the greatest
[13:35] robbery your church has ever had has
[13:38] been when they've taken a denominational
[13:40] light and refused the genuine light of
[13:42] the bible the christ
[13:44] so the greatest robbery that ever
[13:46] happened in the world was caused by a
[13:47] false light
[13:48] and the church fails in its commission
[13:50] to continually walk in the light by a
[13:52] glare of another day
[13:55] so we look at this and just continuing
[13:57] this up
[13:59] we see that when
[14:01] when enoch was building the the the
[14:03] pyramid in the wilderness remember i
[14:05] spoke about that there was a there was a
[14:06] third walk to enoch's journey
[14:08] and the first uh 0-65 he walked as other
[14:12] men walked he did his own thing but at
[14:14] the birth of his son methuselah he began
[14:16] to walk
[14:17] with the lord and we all know what he
[14:19] was doing for those 300 years brother
[14:21] banham said he was building a pyramid he
[14:23] was a prophet of god and he could look
[14:25] up into the heavens god's first bible
[14:26] and see the stars and see that god was
[14:28] in the stars and how god's entire
[14:31] expression in the bible was first
[14:32] written in the stars and being a prophet
[14:34] he could take what he saw of god and
[14:36] bring it into a physical form upon this
[14:38] earth
[14:39] but it only took him up so high
[14:43] what he could bring into a physical
[14:44] manifestation was the the body of christ
[14:47] right and he brought that into a place
[14:50] but yet he was still in this dimension
[14:52] but then it came another point in
[14:54] enoch's journey where enoch walked with
[14:56] god again and if you go read that you'll
[14:58] find that that is true he was walking
[15:00] with god through seven church ages yes
[15:02] but he began to walk with god again and
[15:04] that beginning to that walk took him
[15:06] into a body change that was a capstone
[15:09] ministry that was a third pole ministry
[15:12] that was the unveiling of the mysteries
[15:14] of god the seven seals loosed the seven
[15:17] thunders uttering their voices and it
[15:19] brought a dimensional change for enoch
[15:22] and so when i was looking at this i'm
[15:25] realizing that you can never stop
[15:27] walking in the light
[15:28] as he is in the light and we know that
[15:30] brother branham was the seventh
[15:32] angel to the seventh church age
[15:35] right
[15:36] now brother brandon made a call and he
[15:38] said i'm building a platform
[15:40] for someone else to come upon
[15:43] right
[15:44] so
[15:45] when anybody says that you always kind
[15:46] of think of an eighth messenger well i
[15:48] believe in an eighth messenger it was
[15:50] jesus christ
[15:51] christ was that eighth messenger brother
[15:53] branham was laying a platform for
[15:54] another one to come so that brother
[15:56] branham can say i must decrease he must
[15:58] increase follow the lamb
[16:00] wherever the lamb you must wherever the
[16:02] lamb goes you must go wherever he goes
[16:04] you must continue from this point on so
[16:06] brother branham wasn't ever trying to
[16:08] draw people to himself or get a church
[16:10] or get a group of people all gathered
[16:12] together that could believe all the
[16:13] stories and believe all the miracles and
[16:15] believe all the tying up of the loose
[16:17] sins brother branham was gathering a
[16:18] people to point them to a person jesus
[16:20] christ to take them into the fullness of
[16:22] the word and fully possess the land that
[16:24] they were ordained to take that's the
[16:26] open book
[16:27] that was the ministry of this that was
[16:29] brother branham's commission and that
[16:31] was his goal to see to it that he could
[16:34] properly hand this woman off to this man
[16:37] in a marriage and in a union
[16:40] and so i this is this this is where it
[16:43] gets strange for me and you all know i'm
[16:44] strange so i have embraced that fully um
[16:49] so the last time i preached
[16:53] i said something sorry let me just take
[16:54] a drink of water
[16:59] i had um
[17:00] i said some things that i did not even
[17:02] know that i had said until after i had
[17:04] said it and then it started to come
[17:05] together for me and now i'm not a highly
[17:07] detail-oriented individual that's not my
[17:09] nature
[17:10] my nature is i notice things i see big
[17:13] pictures but then when it comes to the
[17:14] details i bow out and i say there's many
[17:17] other brothers more qualified than me
[17:19] but for some reason he started to draw
[17:21] my attention to some mathematics
[17:24] and i shared this with the brother that
[17:25] for some reason me a guy who's not that
[17:28] great with math or the ability to put
[17:30] all the details together i'm seeing
[17:32] numbers jumping out at the off the page
[17:34] to me and i don't know why
[17:36] and if you remember what i had said was
[17:37] i said now um
[17:39] i was telling the story of lazarus and i
[17:41] said you know look here comes the
[17:42] seventh seal coming in the fourth day
[17:46] lazarus in the grave okay lazarus
[17:49] corruption had set in here's the seventh
[17:51] seal coming on the on the fourth day
[17:54] and and what
[17:56] if you play out the story a little bit
[17:58] well what is seven times four
[18:00] brother brian
[18:02] 28
[18:03] right
[18:04] he knew it he wasn't stalling he knew it
[18:06] so it's 28 7 times 4 is 28 and so then i
[18:10] began to look and my wife was the one
[18:12] who reminded me she said do you realize
[18:14] where your scripture came from tonight
[18:16] because you said i have i want to draw
[18:18] special emphasis to this scripture
[18:21] well i just read the scripture but i
[18:22] didn't notice the verse
[18:24] the master has come and he calleth thee
[18:26] is verse 28
[18:29] and it's the coming of the lord
[18:31] and it's the coming of the lord at
[18:33] certain time and he's coming in secret
[18:34] and he's calling a woman martha to come
[18:36] unto him and martha he gets asked the
[18:38] question have you recognized your day
[18:40] and its message and she when she
[18:42] recognizes her day and her message she
[18:44] realizes the present tense i am is here
[18:45] now we're not waiting for him to come
[18:47] and when she recognizes her day in the
[18:49] massive message she goes quickly on
[18:51] behalf of of the lord jesus christ to
[18:54] her sister mary and bids her secretly
[18:57] saying the master is come and he calleth
[19:00] for thee
[19:02] and so i'm odd i'm like wow that is so
[19:04] interesting because in my heart i wanted
[19:06] to take from what i said the last time
[19:07] into the seventh seal and here i'm
[19:09] realizing 28 uh here we are
[19:13] this is all coming together so i want to
[19:15] take some time and just look at some
[19:16] mathematics are you okay with that do
[19:18] you think that that's bible
[19:20] do you think the prophet of god said god
[19:21] hides himself in mathematics okay good
[19:24] notice how mysteriously and how
[19:27] mathematically it fits right into the
[19:29] scripture exactly now i want you to
[19:31] remember he is bringing this out in the
[19:32] beginning of the seventh seal
[19:35] exactly you believe in god's mathematics
[19:38] if you don't you're sure lost
[19:40] if you get lost you'll you'll get lost
[19:42] in the word if you start putting your
[19:43] fours or sixes or something besides just
[19:45] the mathematical words running in order
[19:47] you'll sure have
[19:49] have on your scene a cow picking grass
[19:51] up in the tree on top of a tree
[19:53] somewhere you'll certainly run out
[19:55] because god does not his whole word does
[19:58] not does run completely in mathematics
[20:01] yes sir perfect most perfect there's no
[20:04] other literature written like it and so
[20:07] perfect in mathematics
[20:10] okay
[20:10] can i keep going
[20:12] amen
[20:13] bible study
[20:15] not knowing brother branham says in
[20:16] christ is the mystery of god reveal not
[20:18] knowing of course being spiritual you
[20:20] you watch spiritual things not knowing
[20:23] this
[20:24] god knows it but if you'll turn and look
[20:27] at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock
[20:29] the end of the second pole and the third
[20:32] pole is at hand see
[20:34] brother bannon begins to sing the song
[20:36] the second poll has been manifested and
[20:38] remember the song goes up an octave
[20:40] higher did you notice the spirit took
[20:42] the song same song and picked it up an
[20:45] octave higher like that the next pole is
[20:48] at hand amen
[20:51] now i put that picture not for you but
[20:53] for me because i do not understand music
[20:55] at all
[20:56] but we can see that an octave i guess
[20:58] there's seven notes right and a key is
[21:01] that right and then an octave would be
[21:03] the same notes just in a higher pitch
[21:06] right which would technically be an
[21:08] eighth note if you're moving from the
[21:10] first seven notes into the eighth right
[21:12] am i okay with that
[21:14] music people are shaking their heads i
[21:15] got it halfway close
[21:17] so brother branham is noticing and
[21:19] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[21:20] here that the second poll is over we're
[21:21] going into the third poll ministry and
[21:23] so we're entering into the eighth we're
[21:25] going into an octave higher the eighth
[21:28] uh an eighth note we'll put it that way
[21:31] and i had um
[21:33] i just so yeah i'm very transparent i
[21:35] had a dream and i had a dream the other
[21:38] day and these numbers like i'm not i'm
[21:39] not drawn to this stuff so i don't
[21:41] understand and i started i started
[21:43] talking in my dream to some brothers and
[21:45] then and i was talking to these brothers
[21:47] and one of the brother i knew two of
[21:48] these brothers
[21:50] and so one of these brothers he was
[21:51] saying brother i have a hard time with
[21:52] you keep saying eighth day you keep
[21:54] saying eighth day i said well i
[21:55] understand you're probably tripping up
[21:57] on the terminology
[21:58] i said it's just terminology you're
[22:00] tripping up on he said well i can't see
[22:01] anything other than seven church ages i
[22:03] said okay i understand that but remember
[22:05] that's in time i said if you and i took
[22:08] a pen and i took and i remember this
[22:09] whole thing i took a pen i said now look
[22:12] one has a starting point and an ending
[22:14] point two a starting point an ending
[22:16] point three starting point ending point
[22:19] four starting point ending point five
[22:22] six seven i said but eight
[22:24] there's no beginning and no end it just
[22:26] continues on so it's not back to a time
[22:29] limit of days it's back into eternity
[22:32] back into the mind of god back into that
[22:34] which has no beginning and no ending
[22:36] time is blending into eternity here
[22:39] and so i i was just interested that you
[22:42] know i don't do stuff like that i don't
[22:44] think numbers or dream about numbers
[22:46] but i began to realize you know eighth
[22:48] day is another one of those scarecrows
[22:49] that scares people anytime you say eight
[22:51] and we're going into the eighth day but
[22:53] jesus stood up on the eighth day of the
[22:55] great feast and said come unto me right
[22:58] he stood up and proclaimed his hour and
[23:00] his day and that he was here now
[23:03] and so i would like to continue if this
[23:06] is okay
[23:08] after this i looked and behold a door
[23:10] was open in heaven and the first voice
[23:13] which i heard was as it were a trumpet
[23:16] talking with me which said come up
[23:18] hither and i will show thee things which
[23:21] must be hereafter now i want to stop you
[23:24] in this and look at this john in
[23:26] revelations 4 is saying after this after
[23:28] what
[23:30] is the question after what was after
[23:33] seven church ages
[23:35] after seven church ages there's a voice
[23:37] calling him to come up higher
[23:40] now here's my question
[23:42] did the voice did not say go up higher
[23:45] the voice said come up higher
[23:47] now jesus said i come quickly i come
[23:49] quickly i come quickly through the the
[23:51] first seven church ages right and then
[23:53] he comes to the seven church age and he
[23:55] says i'm at the door knocking come unto
[23:57] me right so if any man will open the
[23:59] door i will sup with him and and commune
[24:02] with him so here he is he's calling you
[24:04] calling you calling you now when noah
[24:06] went into the ark
[24:09] god said come into the ark
[24:12] he did not say go into the ark
[24:15] the bible says he said come into the ark
[24:18] if he said come into the ark where was
[24:20] god
[24:21] god was in the ark he was bidding him to
[24:24] come in unto him he didn't say go into
[24:27] he said come into and here in
[24:29] revelations 4 he's saying come up hither
[24:32] and when he comes up hither immediately
[24:34] i was in the spirit and behold a throne
[24:36] was set in heaven and one sat upon the
[24:38] throne he finds himself in before the
[24:40] throne
[24:42] and if you keep reading down through
[24:43] there the seven golden candlesticks
[24:44] there's the four and 20 elders we are
[24:47] back in the same scene of the tabernacle
[24:49] in the wilderness everything has been
[24:51] brought back to this point
[24:54] still okay
[24:55] still cruising with numbers
[24:58] so
[25:00] um brother branham obviously in uh the
[25:03] cloud and then brother chad preaches the
[25:04] cloud on wednesday after i preach come
[25:06] on
[25:07] the masters come and call us for thee
[25:09] and i had uh this with about four other
[25:12] things that i just felt to stop when i
[25:14] stopped and i didn't go into it and then
[25:16] so brother chad goes into the cloud and
[25:18] the brother brother ben brings out that
[25:20] you're the words in the book and better
[25:21] not add to it or take away from that
[25:24] great revelation see it's not so much i
[25:26] i agree we also don't want to be found
[25:28] adding to
[25:29] this revelation let's say put it this
[25:31] way we don't want to add to this word
[25:33] because we are the words in the book and
[25:34] we are the expression of his desire but
[25:36] we also don't want to take away
[25:38] so many times it's so hard for us to
[25:40] realize that we are a part of this great
[25:42] plan of god and we are the expression of
[25:44] his desire and so many times we just
[25:47] have a hard time realizing the
[25:49] importance we have in the picture of
[25:50] christ
[25:52] but i just want to continue with this
[25:54] now
[25:55] february 28th is when brother branham
[25:57] was caught up into the cloud 1963 now
[26:00] remember february 28th
[26:02] now if we continue on here these are
[26:05] some things brother brother franco help
[26:06] me with in getting some of this uh
[26:09] information
[26:10] um
[26:11] now
[26:13] weather-wise was a magazine
[26:15] and here's what i believe
[26:17] that meteorologist said
[26:18] he said the cloud lay right at the base
[26:20] of the region
[26:22] of exclusion that's a fancy way for
[26:25] saying it was too high for moisture i
[26:27] believe
[26:28] for water drops and ice particles in
[26:30] that layer where temperatures are so
[26:32] warm that saturation vapor pressures
[26:34] exceed ambient pressures ain't that that
[26:37] sounds smart
[26:38] if this if this was in fact the
[26:41] aftermath of the thor explosion
[26:43] persistence of circulation of con and of
[26:46] condensate for nearly four hours of
[26:49] downward draft would be of considerable
[26:51] meteorological interest
[26:53] means it ain't possible and us
[26:56] meteorologists would love to know how
[26:58] that's even possible so basically saying
[27:00] there's no moisture up that high guys it
[27:03] can't happen this is something we've
[27:05] never seen or never observed right
[27:09] so just want to continue dropping that
[27:10] thought in there there's no moisture up
[27:12] that high
[27:13] now in the science magazine it appeared
[27:16] again and it was obviously
[27:19] the 28th of february and the cloud it
[27:21] was just a red part and the cloud
[27:23] remained sunlit for 28 minutes after
[27:26] local sunset
[27:28] and i believe it was 28 miles in the air
[27:31] something close to that so it happened
[27:33] on february 28th it stayed in the sky
[27:36] past sunlight for 28 and um
[27:40] and i believe it was 28
[27:42] it was 28 miles high
[27:45] now the number 28 which brother chad had
[27:47] brought this out before and some of this
[27:48] is just review i understand
[27:50] but obviously the number 28 is also the
[27:52] cycle of for a woman right
[27:54] her cycle is 28 days so it's a cycle of
[27:57] life and it just repeats over and over
[27:59] this cycle of life so 28 is the cycle of
[28:01] life and obviously this uh this this
[28:04] cloud appears in life magazine um
[28:08] and it appears on may 17th may 17th
[28:11] clearly the same day that noah went into
[28:13] the ark right so it was salvation for
[28:16] noah and his family but it was judgment
[28:17] for the world when that cloud came down
[28:20] it was calling me up higher but for the
[28:22] rest of the world he was the judge
[28:23] executing judgment upon all those that
[28:25] would reject the word of god right so
[28:28] he's doing both at the same time
[28:32] just continuing you know these pictures
[28:35] the
[28:36] so there was a cloud over um if you took
[28:39] the picture you could see there's the
[28:40] high cloud of mystery there's there's
[28:42] the cloud and then there's the rain
[28:44] there's a rainbow that was caused by the
[28:46] moon we all remember that um and what's
[28:48] interesting is the moon follows the same
[28:50] cycle of 28 days
[28:52] so this 28 days is a cycle that
[28:54] continues on from one uh from a new moon
[28:56] to another new moon right and for a lady
[28:58] it's a cycle that continues but remember
[29:00] it was 28 miles high it's too high for
[29:03] water moisture and uh it's just not
[29:05] possible possible meteorologically
[29:08] speaking
[29:10] so i had said something here the last
[29:11] time too in regards to that cloud about
[29:14] how in hebrews it says we are compassed
[29:16] about by a great cloud of witnesses
[29:19] and uh i wanted to to just drop this in
[29:22] here it says when he and acts it says
[29:25] when he had spoken these things while
[29:26] they beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[29:29] received him out of their sight and
[29:31] while they looked steadfastly toward
[29:33] heaven as he went up behold two men
[29:36] stood by them in white apparel which
[29:38] also said you men of galilee why stand
[29:40] you here gazing into heaven this same
[29:42] jesus which was taken up in the form
[29:45] from you into heaven shall so come in
[29:47] like manner as ye have seen him go up he
[29:50] went up in a cloud he returns in a cloud
[29:52] and now there's two witnesses there that
[29:54] are rebuking those that continue to
[29:55] stand there looking at the cloud
[29:57] wondering what's it all about
[29:59] now
[30:00] remember this is not moisture it's too
[30:03] high for moisture
[30:05] and the bible says this that your know
[30:08] you not uh for what shall be on the
[30:10] morrow for what is your life it is even
[30:11] a vapor that appears for a little while
[30:13] and vanisheth away so god himself likens
[30:16] you to a vapor that's here for a short
[30:17] period of time and then it goes away
[30:20] and this vanisheth away is a greek word
[30:23] that means to vanish away or to snatch
[30:25] out of sight or to take out of you or to
[30:27] make one unseen
[30:30] in hebrews obviously we went through
[30:32] this in a great cloud of witnesses
[30:35] that are you know you not that you're
[30:37] compassed about with a great cloud of
[30:38] witnesses so then a brother texts me and
[30:41] says uh brother did you know brother
[30:42] branham said this
[30:44] in uh or from overseas and when i found
[30:46] i said praise god now i'm starting to
[30:48] see a picture here develop he says you
[30:50] see you say brother branham is that
[30:53] mythical he says no sir i'll show you in
[30:55] the scriptures here in a minute when he
[30:57] began to go up they only seen him but
[31:00] the old testament saints went with him
[31:02] for the bible said that he led captivity
[31:04] captive and gave gifts unto men and i
[31:07] can see him as he goes up and joins with
[31:10] his church
[31:11] two angels of that band that were
[31:13] playing the music come back
[31:15] there and said ye men of galilee why
[31:18] stand you looking up for this same jesus
[31:20] that was taken up is coming again
[31:23] certainly they hurried back to join the
[31:25] procession and down through the skies
[31:27] jesus and the old testament saints went
[31:29] they passed the moon they passed the sun
[31:32] they passed the stars
[31:34] so those two those two uh witnesses came
[31:37] out of that cloud these were the two
[31:39] witnesses saying why stand you here
[31:41] gazing so the cloud was made up of the
[31:43] old testament saints that resurrected
[31:45] with jesus 2000 years ago
[31:48] so then continuing to follow this
[31:49] through what a resurrection that that
[31:51] was what a resurrection that this is
[31:54] what all is represented in this cloud
[31:56] and the reason why i'm asking this
[31:58] question is simply put because
[32:01] it the question is not to you what was
[32:03] the attraction on the mountain the
[32:05] question to you is what is the
[32:07] attraction on the mountain
[32:09] because truly it is the veil truly it is
[32:12] something that is a stumbling block for
[32:13] so many but for us it is the very
[32:15] gateway to bringing us into our promised
[32:17] land but it all comes down to a
[32:19] recognition of what is this all all
[32:22] about right
[32:24] so i want to look at this from a veil
[32:29] so
[32:30] y'all okay
[32:32] it's a little quiet i know it's a little
[32:33] different i'm sorry it's just a little
[32:35] different
[32:37] now brother branham says in the
[32:38] unveiling of god
[32:40] he says if a man walked through that
[32:42] veil it was sudden death
[32:44] okay
[32:45] it was sudden death
[32:47] now it's death not to go through it
[32:51] okay
[32:52] it was death before you went behind that
[32:54] veil now it is death if you do not go
[32:57] through it
[32:58] if you can't break the veil of tradition
[33:01] break through that wall of denomination
[33:04] to see god in his power it's death
[33:08] once where it was death to go in
[33:11] now it is death to stay out the whole
[33:14] mercy seat is setting in plain view
[33:16] anybody can see it the veil is rent
[33:19] glory to god the whole mercy seat comes
[33:21] into plain view
[33:23] so this is a very big statement
[33:26] where it was once death if any man
[33:29] should go behind the veil once the veil
[33:31] is rent
[33:32] you have to go and i want to bring this
[33:34] with that silence right so i had caught
[33:36] this the other morning when i was
[33:38] thinking about esther and obviously
[33:40] again i don't think i've been here
[33:41] preaching for the last six months or i
[33:43] don't mention esther so i thought hey
[33:44] let's just bring up esther again
[33:46] so here's the reality with esther esther
[33:49] had a um
[33:51] i i'd like to dramatize it a little bit
[33:53] for you you know she had uh she had
[33:55] lived her own life she was a um she lost
[33:58] her mom and dad she was taken up into
[34:00] the the raising of mordecai so she had
[34:03] no choice in the matter she was she had
[34:05] a just a life that was putting her on a
[34:07] certain path
[34:08] and a certain time came along she was a
[34:10] beautiful woman and she was taken
[34:12] because of her beauty she was taken into
[34:14] the presence uh to be a queen for the
[34:17] for the for the king
[34:19] and as she was there you know obviously
[34:21] they went through a purification process
[34:23] and she had nothing she could do about
[34:25] it it was out of her control they took
[34:27] her
[34:28] through a whole purification process
[34:29] there was nothing she could do about it
[34:32] and obviously the only thing she began
[34:33] to do was she didn't add anything to or
[34:36] take anything away from the instruction
[34:37] of haggai
[34:39] so she was the literal fulfillment of
[34:40] the instructions that haggai was giving
[34:43] and that was exactly what the king was
[34:44] looking for
[34:46] but it came to a certain point in time
[34:49] where she had
[34:50] come to a time where
[34:53] mordecai said for such a time as this
[34:57] if you do not go in unto the king you
[35:00] will surely die
[35:03] you see the parallel
[35:05] now she would die if she didn't
[35:08] and she would maybe die if she does
[35:13] but this one she had to make a choice
[35:16] this one she wasn't ushered in and
[35:17] brought in by the guards this was her
[35:20] own choosing she makes her own choice in
[35:23] this walk
[35:24] right because thou has chosen the harder
[35:26] way
[35:27] thou has walked in thine own choosing
[35:30] now has picked the correct and precise
[35:32] way right it is my way so esther was
[35:35] brought to a decision point now it's
[35:37] death if she doesn't and it's possibly
[35:39] death if she does but we don't know
[35:42] now just thinking if you went back in
[35:45] time and you're looking at the scene
[35:47] when uh when god was in his or when the
[35:50] king was on his throne he's working
[35:52] he had all probably all the scribes and
[35:54] he all the advisors there lots of people
[35:56] there advising him you had his maybe
[35:59] someone with refreshments there you
[36:00] probably had another person with a fan
[36:02] and they're fanning and you had all of
[36:04] these people around there you probably
[36:05] had the walls lined with guards and you
[36:07] probably had guards at the front and
[36:09] everywhere the whole throne room there's
[36:11] activity
[36:12] but what do you think happened when all
[36:14] of a sudden esther walks in
[36:17] do you think it went silent
[36:19] do you think the scribes kept writing
[36:22] do you think anybody kept doing anything
[36:25] do you think everybody was in awe
[36:27] and shock
[36:28] what is going on
[36:30] they were so awed by what is happening
[36:33] in this
[36:34] complete silence here comes esther
[36:37] now what's so beautiful about it if you
[36:39] notice esther continues to probably keep
[36:41] her eyes on the king
[36:44] she's probably not looking around she's
[36:46] keeping her eyes on the king and she's
[36:48] looking for one thing one action one
[36:50] movement she's waiting to see him lift
[36:52] that scepter and extend it to her in
[36:55] mercy
[36:56] and accept her and and he did and when
[36:59] he extended the scepter and accepted her
[37:01] in mercy what does he say he says esther
[37:04] what is it that you want i'll give you
[37:06] up to half of my kingdom you're a joint
[37:09] heir with me come sit with me on my
[37:11] throne help me rule
[37:13] right so in that moment of silence
[37:15] esther's going in behind the veil
[37:18] and she's meeting the king and she's
[37:20] finding out she's accepted and she is
[37:22] joining her with the king
[37:24] so in looking at that it was death if
[37:26] you didn't
[37:27] it was death if you did now it's death
[37:29] if you don't
[37:30] and noticing this moment of silence with
[37:32] esther and now where are we
[37:34] at so in continuing to look at this uh
[37:38] this these veils
[37:41] brother banham says here he says now in
[37:43] the seventh seal how how is he going to
[37:45] do it that's what we don't know isn't it
[37:48] we don't know it's even the time for all
[37:50] these things it's the ushering in of the
[37:53] millennium notice the breaking of the
[37:55] seal was so great that heaven was hushed
[37:57] by it in silence for the space of a half
[38:01] an hour now it is great what is it it
[38:05] has hushed heaven there wasn't a thing
[38:08] that moved for half an hour now a half
[38:11] an hour might not be long if you're
[38:13] having a good time but in the suspense
[38:16] between life or death and life it seemed
[38:20] like a millennium
[38:21] it was so great jesus never mentioned it
[38:24] none of the rest of them john couldn't
[38:26] even write it no he was forbidden to
[38:29] write it here see there's just he just
[38:31] didn't write it but it was it's just in
[38:35] silence
[38:37] so looking at this journey
[38:40] to the throne because remember my my
[38:42] thought is back into the light behind
[38:43] the veil
[38:45] we recognize that there was uh
[38:47] there was a lion the ox the man and the
[38:49] eagle that were encamped about the old
[38:50] testament tabernacle here and everybody
[38:53] had to come in through the east and
[38:54] continue westward
[38:56] and you had to go past the the altar you
[38:59] had to go through
[39:00] the inner court and in the inner court
[39:02] was the seven golden candlesticks
[39:04] and it was a scary thing to think that
[39:06] you might have to pass the seventh
[39:08] golden candlestick to go into the
[39:10] shekinah light
[39:11] it's a very scary thing
[39:14] but i like i said the last time and i
[39:16] will repeat again the tying up of the
[39:18] loose sins was not the message that
[39:20] awakens the bride and there has to be
[39:22] something that you can realize is before
[39:24] you that you have to continue to walk
[39:26] into
[39:27] it is a scary scary thing to leave the
[39:30] light of seven golden candlesticks but
[39:32] it is exactly what he was calling us
[39:34] unto he was calling us back to the
[39:36] throne and it was death before you went
[39:39] in there now it's death if you don't go
[39:41] in there either way someone's going to
[39:44] die
[39:45] either you're going to die to your will
[39:47] and god's will will be done or vice
[39:49] versa what happens here
[39:52] so as we see this the the the the
[39:54] approacher is coming past the seven cold
[39:57] golden candlesticks and he's coming
[39:58] before this veil
[40:01] now the veil in the old testament
[40:03] tabernacle is made out of badger skins
[40:06] right badger skins and one thing about a
[40:09] badger is they're meaner than the devil
[40:11] himself if you know anything about
[40:13] badgers they're about the only thing
[40:14] that'll take on a lion they're so
[40:16] verocious and they're so aggressive
[40:18] and uh
[40:19] those badger skins guys guess what it's
[40:21] you
[40:22] um uh there's there's really you have no
[40:25] enemy other than you the one that you
[40:27] look at in the mirror you're your
[40:29] greatest enemy brother branham said he
[40:30] was his greatest enemy and the one
[40:32] you're looking to overcome is you and uh
[40:35] so i find that after the seven golden
[40:37] candlesticks the last enemy to be
[40:39] defeated as jesus was in the garden of
[40:41] cassette to me he said not my will but
[40:43] thy will be done father because thou has
[40:45] chosen the harder way the narrow way the
[40:47] house walked and thine own choosing it
[40:48] it is my way so what are you doing
[40:51] you're dying out to your own ways your
[40:52] own traditions your own comfort zones
[40:54] and realizing he's bidding me come i
[40:56] better start moving
[40:57] because he wants you back behind the
[40:59] veil
[41:00] and so continuing to look at this
[41:03] in exodus 26 looking at this veil this
[41:06] is this is just what caught me
[41:08] this veil it says in exodus 26 1
[41:10] moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle
[41:13] with 10 curtains of fine twined linen
[41:16] blue and purple and scarlet with
[41:18] cherubims of cunning work shalt thou
[41:20] make them the length of one curtain
[41:22] shall be eight and 20 cubits it's 28
[41:25] cubits
[41:26] and the breadth shall be four cubits and
[41:29] every one of the curtains shall have one
[41:32] measure the five curtains shall be
[41:34] coupled together one to another and the
[41:36] other five curtains shall be coupled one
[41:38] to another so let me break that down for
[41:40] you
[41:41] it's 28 cubits high okay
[41:44] okay
[41:45] and there's
[41:46] there's
[41:47] there's a uh there's two four cubit wide
[41:51] um
[41:52] veils okay and they're five veils thick
[41:56] okay so 28 cubic ti
[41:59] and if you measure the width here you're
[42:01] eight
[42:02] eight cubits wide
[42:04] and there's five curtains sewn together
[42:06] okay
[42:07] you okay all right
[42:09] 28 there will be silence in heaven for
[42:11] the space of a
[42:13] about a half an hour
[42:14] okay now the seventh seal appears in the
[42:17] what chapter
[42:19] the eighth chapter
[42:21] which is also appears also this eight
[42:23] appears technically in revelations four
[42:26] because it's after seven church ages we
[42:28] are going into come up hither
[42:30] eternity
[42:31] but then this question begins to come
[42:33] what is the five
[42:35] and i sat there for a few minutes until
[42:38] we know this
[42:39] i mean
[42:40] five is grace
[42:42] okay but there's two curtains
[42:45] there's grace on this side and there's
[42:47] grace on this side
[42:50] grace grace
[42:52] so 28 cubits eight cubits wide two
[42:55] curtains screaming grace grace
[42:58] sound familiar
[43:01] so let's see where grace grace was it's
[43:03] in zechariah it's a story here about
[43:06] zerubbabel
[43:08] he said the angel that talked with me
[43:09] came again and waked me as a man that is
[43:12] waked out of his sleep and said unto me
[43:14] what siesta and i said i have looked and
[43:17] behold a candlestick of all gold with a
[43:19] bowl on top of it and seven lamps there
[43:21] on and seven pipes in the seven lamps
[43:24] which are upon the top thereof so where
[43:27] is he he's back uh before the throne
[43:29] room
[43:30] and the two olive trees one one upon the
[43:33] right side of the bowl and one upon the
[43:35] left side and so i answered and spake
[43:38] unto the angel and talked with him
[43:39] saying what are these my lord
[43:42] then the angel that talked with me
[43:43] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[43:45] not what these be and i said no my lord
[43:48] then he answered and spake unto me
[43:50] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[43:52] zerubbabel saying
[43:54] not by might nor by power but by my
[43:58] spirit saith the lord of hosts thou
[44:01] who art thou o great mountain before
[44:03] zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and
[44:06] he shall bring forth the headstone
[44:08] therefore with shouting screaming grace
[44:12] grace unto it moreover the word of the
[44:15] lord came into me saying the hands of
[44:16] zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[44:19] this house and his hands shall finish it
[44:22] the capstone
[44:24] and thou shalt know the lord of hosts
[44:26] hath sent me unto you
[44:29] so what was those two screens of five
[44:31] curtains grace grace the capstone amen
[44:35] so god in taking his elect out of
[44:38] pentecostal church that hybrid pulling
[44:41] it out and finishing up the word and
[44:43] it's got to be so close until the word
[44:45] itself will blend with this word here
[44:47] comes the headstone crying grace grace
[44:50] amazing grace the headstone here you are
[44:54] like this see on there see how it was
[44:56] way wide down here let's talk about the
[44:59] pyramid it was real wide here at the
[45:01] base
[45:02] and it keeps getting closer and closer
[45:04] the ministry well after a while here
[45:06] here's luther justification justified
[45:08] here's wesley sanctifica sanctified
[45:10] bunch here comes the pentecostal
[45:12] restoration against gifts
[45:15] but now god is taking from here honing
[45:17] out a bunch to take a ministry just
[45:21] exactly like the word there because it's
[45:23] got to fit with the word there's the
[45:26] bride see take her up
[45:30] so
[45:31] i find it interesting i i can't
[45:33] understand exactly why i look at these
[45:35] these numbers the way i am
[45:37] and he continues he says the headstone
[45:39] crying grace grace that's passed from
[45:41] death
[45:42] and creed into the living word of the
[45:44] living god god's only provided plan for
[45:47] this age his sons in the word age
[45:51] quickened by the spirit like a spark
[45:54] that's lit off of something that's made
[45:56] alive seated now in heavenly places what
[45:59] does he say next
[46:01] in present tense
[46:04] this is not past tense this is not
[46:06] future tense
[46:07] this is now
[46:09] in present tense a word age
[46:11] back from
[46:13] after this seven golden candlesticks
[46:15] seven church ages now into a word age a
[46:18] bride age an eternal age back with
[46:20] christ himself behind the throne the
[46:22] veil has been rent we see the 28th day
[46:26] what it was the coming of the lord
[46:27] brother brown said revelations 10 here
[46:30] he comes as a mighty angel descending
[46:31] out of heaven on a cloud with a rainbow
[46:33] upon his head and he screameth and seven
[46:36] thunders uttered their voices the veil
[46:38] is being rent exposing the mercy seat
[46:40] it's once death if you didn't go now
[46:43] it's death if you don't
[46:45] you cannot stay where the seventh golden
[46:48] candlestick was
[46:50] if the veil is rent and he's calling you
[46:52] into the inner of the holy of holies you
[46:55] understand what i'm saying it's not
[46:57] possible anymore there might have been a
[46:59] time
[47:00] and that's the problem brother brahm
[47:01] says the foolish version becomes
[47:03] dilatory
[47:04] they become relaxed there's no more
[47:06] crying out in the spirit there's no more
[47:08] reaching out in the spirit there's no
[47:09] more longing to walk with him there's no
[47:11] more earnestly desiring contending you
[47:14] know paul was called up to the heaven of
[47:16] heavens and when he came back he still
[47:18] said i'm contending i'm earnestly
[47:20] contending for the faith that was once
[47:22] delivered unto the saints having not yet
[47:24] apprehending i press toward the mark of
[47:26] the high calling in christ jesus there's
[47:28] something in the bride that continues to
[47:30] walk in the light as he is in the light
[47:32] so that we can have fellowship with one
[47:33] another and the blood of jesus christ
[47:34] cleanses up all our sins
[47:37] amen
[47:39] so we don't stop
[47:40] we keep going we recognize that he's
[47:43] calling us he's bidding us to come the
[47:45] master has come he calleth for thee
[47:48] okay
[47:51] now let's see what i got here
[47:56] i'll just go to this
[47:58] now the breach between the seven church
[47:59] h's and the seven seals it's thus saith
[48:02] the lord i'll read it to you out of the
[48:04] book the sounding of the seventh angel's
[48:06] message the mystery of god should be
[48:08] finished that's been declared by his
[48:09] holy prophets that's the prophets who
[48:12] wrote the word at the sounding of the
[48:13] seventh church age the last church age
[48:16] all the loose ends that those church
[48:19] ages have ever have been probed at will
[48:22] be wound up together and when the seals
[48:24] are broke the myst and the mystery is
[48:26] revealed down comes the angel the
[48:29] messenger christ the one that brother
[48:30] branham was building a platform for
[48:33] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[48:35] the sea with a rainbow over his head now
[48:38] remember the seventh angel is on earth
[48:40] at the time of his coming
[48:43] okay so
[48:47] so here here's what i want you to look
[48:49] at and here's where i'm kind of
[48:50] basically coming to
[48:53] the seventh angel is coming down when
[48:56] the the seventh angel is here at the
[48:58] time of his coming so when you looked at
[49:00] this
[49:01] and he was breaking the seals this is
[49:03] the seventh angel this is the mighty
[49:05] angel i'm sorry the mighty angel coming
[49:07] down to loose the seven seals right
[49:10] now
[49:11] in that cloud remember
[49:13] the
[49:14] the seven angels made up the wig right
[49:17] brother bam said that the seven the
[49:18] seven angels make up his wig and also
[49:20] brother bam says one man can represent
[49:23] an entire generation right okay so what
[49:26] was represented in that wig white wigged
[49:29] one was the dead saints
[49:31] okay these dead saints were basically
[49:34] represented in that coming of the lord
[49:37] okay
[49:38] now
[49:39] brother branham was also caught up into
[49:41] that cloud
[49:43] so you have the dead
[49:45] and the living
[49:46] caught up at the same time
[49:48] turn in your bibles back now to
[49:50] thessalonians
[49:53] 2 thessalonians
[49:58] verse 15 for this we say unto you the
[50:00] word of the lord that we which are alive
[50:02] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[50:03] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[50:06] for the lord himself shall descend from
[50:08] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[50:09] the archangel in the in the trump of god
[50:11] and the dead in christ shall rise
[50:14] okay the dead in christ shall rise and
[50:16] we which are alive and remain shall be
[50:18] caught up to meet him together
[50:20] caught up together with them in the
[50:22] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[50:25] shall ever we be with the lord
[50:27] so here is a resurrection of two the
[50:30] dead saints and the living
[50:32] at his appearing in the cloud so brother
[50:34] branham
[50:36] 1963 he gets caught up into the cloud
[50:39] here's one man representing an entire
[50:40] generation in the cloud as the living
[50:43] then there's also the seven gold there's
[50:45] the seven angels to the seven or seven
[50:47] church ages represented there as the
[50:50] dead saints that have been risen right
[50:53] so now you have both of them represented
[50:55] at this coming
[50:57] so then i go back and i look here
[51:00] to john
[51:02] please now turn back to john
[51:09] seven
[51:16] no
[51:17] 11.
[51:28] so if you look at
[51:30] chapters 11
[51:31] verse 28
[51:33] okay
[51:34] and when she had said so said she went
[51:37] her way and called mary her sister
[51:38] secretly saying the master is come and
[51:41] calleth for thee okay as soon as she had
[51:43] heard that she arose quickly and came
[51:47] unto him
[51:49] so what you find here is there are two
[51:51] arising there's a dead one and a living
[51:54] that come to him at this coming
[51:56] this is the coming of the lord it's
[51:58] found in verse 28 but it's also the time
[52:00] when lazarus the dead one is rise but
[52:03] there's also another one that's arisen
[52:05] and it's mary
[52:06] mary also recognizes his coming and
[52:09] she's caught up to meet him he comes she
[52:12] speaks is spoken to her secretly right
[52:14] and she leaves the house of misery and
[52:16] she meets him not out in the in the in
[52:19] the house of misery she goes out he
[52:21] comes halfway she goes out halfway there
[52:23] they meet
[52:25] mary is also risen at this coming
[52:28] so i don't know if i'm making any sense
[52:30] at all i i hope that i am it's just
[52:33] these pieces are starting to come
[52:34] together a little bit for me and i don't
[52:36] think i'm putting so many things that
[52:37] far off
[52:39] like i used to that now i'm seeing what
[52:42] is all this what does all this mean what
[52:44] is this what was this cloud
[52:46] not what was the attraction what is this
[52:49] attraction on the mountain
[52:51] is this my coming up too
[52:54] am i represented in brother branham when
[52:56] he got caught up into the cloud do you
[52:58] know the brother banh says about elijah
[53:00] he said elisha told elijah he said i
[53:04] want a double portion of your blessing
[53:06] he said if you see me going
[53:08] you will have your request
[53:10] so elisha never left his side elisha
[53:14] continued to stay with elijah wherever
[53:15] elijah went elisha went and they
[53:18] remember he's following him and he
[53:19] strikes the water in the jordan's part
[53:22] revealing the 12 stones they could pass
[53:24] through get to the other side of jordan
[53:26] elijah is there elisha's right beside
[53:28] him
[53:29] and here elisha goes up in a whirlwind
[53:32] not chariots of fire chariots of fire
[53:34] were there but it was a whirlwind that
[53:36] he got caught up into and we know that
[53:38] elisha saw this dimensional change
[53:41] because if you look at it remember when
[53:43] it's a dimension the the ferry the
[53:45] chariots of fire is another dimension
[53:46] they could see because gaze of the was
[53:48] the servant to elijah right and he could
[53:51] not see he said
[53:53] master we're compassed about with the
[53:54] enemy he said oh lord open his eyes and
[53:56] when he opened his eyes he saw that
[53:58] other dimension and that other dimension
[54:00] there was chariots of fire all around
[54:02] right
[54:03] so elijah
[54:04] sees elijah go up in a whirlwind
[54:08] then elisha elijah sorry takes his
[54:12] mantle casts it back down and what does
[54:15] elijah do elisha wow it's all right he
[54:18] rents his clothes
[54:20] he rents his old ideas he rents his
[54:22] traditions time for that to go away time
[54:25] to wrap myself in this mantle and move
[54:27] forward it's the opening of the word
[54:29] elisha went into it now he's coming back
[54:32] throwing back the same mantle and we
[54:34] know it's a mantle that he wrapped
[54:35] himself in because he takes that same
[54:37] mantle and he strikes the river jordan
[54:39] and the river jordan parts way and
[54:40] reveals the same path
[54:42] could it be
[54:43] he's riding that trail one more time
[54:46] could it be that elijah the spirit of
[54:49] elijah is now on elisha the bride and
[54:52] now she's wrapped in the mantle of god's
[54:55] word and she's going forward partying
[54:57] the water before him separating the way
[54:59] and showing the path that has been
[55:00] hidden in the word
[55:02] it looks to me like it it looks a lot
[55:04] like it and it's just a beautiful type
[55:08] for me to be looking at because remember
[55:10] brother balaam said may he crown my
[55:12] ministry with what may i be found
[55:14] clothing wrapping a bride in the word
[55:17] for your coming remember that he said
[55:19] that may you crown my ministry with
[55:20] clothing a bride in your word and so
[55:23] here's elijah throwing down the mantle
[55:25] and here he is wrapping himself in that
[55:27] same mantle parting going over jordan
[55:29] and going back
[55:31] and then so if you continue to look at
[55:32] this what i'm finding out is this
[55:35] secret mystery of his coming continues
[55:37] to go on and on but very quietly god's
[55:40] not making a lot of ruckus it's not a
[55:42] lot of noise and it's very simple it's
[55:44] very humble but it's the opening of the
[55:47] word and it just continues to open and
[55:49] continue to open
[55:51] so
[55:52] brother franco had made the comment he
[55:53] says you know brother it'd be really
[55:55] awesome if today was the 28th of
[55:57] september
[55:58] he did he said i'd have goosebumps all
[56:00] over if i knew it was the 28th but
[56:02] brother franco it's the 29th
[56:06] it's the 29th okay let's read verse 29
[56:09] as soon as she heard that
[56:11] she arose quickly and came unto him
[56:15] so 28 was the sign of his coming but
[56:18] 29th is the time of her going
[56:22] you understand
[56:26] okay
[56:27] okay
[56:28] so i i
[56:30] i don't understand why i'm doing that i
[56:32] really don't i don't understand why i'm
[56:34] putting these things together the way
[56:35] they are um i just feel like i'm putting
[56:38] some stones out before you right i don't
[56:39] know it's like some pieces of the puzzle
[56:41] i just want to put out before you maybe
[56:42] someone else will come and stand upon it
[56:44] and be able to really put it together so
[56:46] that you could see it in a little bit
[56:47] greater light
[56:50] and i just wanted to also bring your
[56:51] attention some things that i just been
[56:53] looking at different things solomon's
[56:55] temple you know solomon's temple was
[56:57] built in seven
[56:58] years six months
[57:01] and there was something very interesting
[57:03] about solomon's temple it was a the
[57:05] quietest construction site you ever did
[57:07] see in your life
[57:09] because there was not a sound of a buzz
[57:10] saw there was not a sound of a chisel it
[57:12] was quiet everything just came together
[57:15] god was assembling his great dwelling
[57:17] place in silence
[57:20] everything was coming together in
[57:21] silence remember god does great big
[57:23] things in silence
[57:25] he brings up the sun in the rising of
[57:27] the sun and what is he doing he's
[57:29] calling up two million will say water
[57:31] droplets or maybe uh lives i don't know
[57:34] maybe vapors maybe your life is but a
[57:36] vapor just a thought maybe he said that
[57:37] for another reason but it's the rising
[57:39] of the sun and he can call up two
[57:41] million gallons of water quieter than
[57:43] you can pump a glass full he's just
[57:45] doing a lot of things in in silence it's
[57:47] just quiet it's just simple
[57:49] and so now i'm finding myself i think i
[57:52] could be wrong but it sure looks a lot
[57:54] like it
[57:55] that we are now finding ourselves again
[57:56] right before the veil and the veil is
[57:58] being rent and it's exposing the mercy
[58:00] seat
[58:02] and it's a
[58:03] a
[58:04] we'll put it this way it looks to be
[58:06] that such a time as this
[58:08] the veil is being rent and now it must
[58:11] be that time where we must be
[58:15] it's so hard to say not motivated it's
[58:18] not motivated we must recognize the
[58:20] purpose of brother banham's coming in
[58:22] the first place
[58:23] was to call a bride and unite her with
[58:26] isaac right i just want to drop this in
[58:29] so
[58:30] eliezer and
[58:32] isaac right in rebecca did you know the
[58:34] bible said or brother banham said that
[58:35] the angel of the lord went ahead of
[58:37] eliezer by about a half an hour
[58:41] he went ahead to prepare the woman to
[58:43] get her ready for the space of a half an
[58:45] hour about a half an hour maybe 28
[58:47] minutes is my guess
[58:48] but i think it was about 28 minutes and
[58:51] so here he is preparing her and if you
[58:53] remember when she comes back eliezer
[58:55] prays a prayer and he says lord may the
[58:57] one that waters my camel
[58:59] and gives me water and waters my camel
[59:02] may she be the damsel that thou has
[59:03] chosen and when he comes up he says only
[59:06] one part of it he says will you give me
[59:09] a drink and she says oh sure i'll give
[59:11] you a drink and your camel's a drink
[59:14] what is this
[59:15] she caught the unspoken part there was
[59:18] something inside of her that could catch
[59:20] what was not spoken but yet was the word
[59:22] of the lord there was something inside
[59:25] of her that could catch the things that
[59:26] was not a public show it was not out
[59:28] there in the open as brother branham
[59:30] took that knight or that sword and he
[59:32] and he rent the top of it and he says
[59:34] light has never shined in on this
[59:36] what's going on
[59:39] i think i think god is getting rebecca
[59:42] ready
[59:43] and if you remember there was a
[59:45] temptation all these numbers i'm sorry
[59:46] these numbers so there was a temptation
[59:49] for her the temptation came when eleazar
[59:52] said it's time to go
[59:54] i'm going we're going now my master is
[59:56] old it's time to go isaac is looking for
[59:59] a wife we gotta go and what was the
[1:00:01] temptation to her her temptation came
[1:00:03] from her own family saying stay with us
[1:00:06] for 10 days
[1:00:08] just stay 10 days see taste feel smell
[1:00:10] here imagination conscious reasoning
[1:00:12] affections emotions what were the ten
[1:00:15] the twelve spies but there was ten lying
[1:00:17] spies that were deceived by what they
[1:00:19] could see but joshua and caleb said
[1:00:22] we're more than able to take this lamb
[1:00:24] because greater is he that is in us than
[1:00:26] he that is is before us basically right
[1:00:30] so there was rebecca's little temptation
[1:00:32] she had to overcome the ten spies
[1:00:35] so now we're walking by faith
[1:00:37] now we're seeing the opening of the word
[1:00:39] now the veil is rent and now
[1:00:43] she arose quickly
[1:00:44] and came unto him
[1:00:46] stand please
[1:00:48] i did not want to be long i achieved my
[1:00:50] goal
[1:00:53] i achieved my goal
[1:00:56] i'm sorry it was a very different i
[1:00:57] didn't feel the same anointing like i
[1:00:59] usually do and you guys feel the same
[1:01:01] way i can tell but that's totally fine
[1:01:03] there's some purpose in it i know
[1:01:04] there's a purpose in it i know he didn't
[1:01:06] bring me to all these things for no
[1:01:08] reason
[1:01:09] i i know there was so now i'm just
[1:01:11] continually looking at all of these
[1:01:13] things
[1:01:14] and we'll see where god wants to
[1:01:16] continue to take us i do want to read
[1:01:18] one other scripture as if you would grab
[1:01:20] your bibles
[1:01:22] and it's in john
[1:01:27] chapter 7
[1:01:30] and just showing you
[1:01:32] the most amazing story
[1:01:35] in a shocking story
[1:01:37] if you read john chapter 7
[1:01:40] there
[1:01:41] his brethren jesus is brethren are
[1:01:42] getting on him because they want him to
[1:01:44] make himself public they want him to
[1:01:47] unveil himself he says you're doing
[1:01:49] you're doing things quietly why don't
[1:01:50] you go make yourself known right
[1:01:52] and so they they even say uh you know
[1:01:55] they went up jesus bid them to go up and
[1:01:56] in verse 10 he says
[1:01:58] but when his brethren were gone up then
[1:02:01] went he also up unto the feast but not
[1:02:03] openly but he but as it were in a secret
[1:02:07] right
[1:02:08] and so as you continue on his coming to
[1:02:10] his tabernacle coming to the temple in
[1:02:12] secret quietly
[1:02:14] and then as he's there
[1:02:16] they begin to have an argument in the
[1:02:18] presence of jesus and the argument was
[1:02:21] if the christ were to come he would come
[1:02:23] and do this and this
[1:02:24] he wouldn't do it quite this way he
[1:02:26] would do it this way in this way they're
[1:02:28] debating the coming of the lord and how
[1:02:30] he will come in the very presence of the
[1:02:32] lord he's standing right in the presence
[1:02:35] of them in the temple and there's a
[1:02:37] debate are you going to come this way or
[1:02:39] should you come this way and he's
[1:02:41] standing right before them and in verse
[1:02:44] 28 jesus cried in the temple and taught
[1:02:48] saying ye both know me and you know
[1:02:50] whence i am and i am come of myself but
[1:02:54] he that sent me is true whom he know not
[1:02:57] so again in verse 28 here's the seventh
[1:03:00] seal himself making himself known in the
[1:03:02] presence of those that are still
[1:03:04] debating whether or not he's gonna come
[1:03:06] this way or is he gonna come like this
[1:03:09] pretty amazing huh
[1:03:10] very interesting how these things are
[1:03:12] happening
[1:03:14] so it's the 29th of september
[1:03:18] not trying to make too much out of
[1:03:20] numbers but
[1:03:22] are you going to arise at his coming
[1:03:24] and go meet him
[1:03:26] let's just have a quick word of prayer
[1:03:28] here
[1:03:30] heavenly father lord we just come before
[1:03:32] you lord we're so thankful for your word
[1:03:34] thankful for your truth
[1:03:36] lord we're thankful for these little
[1:03:38] things
[1:03:40] they they seem simple but lord you've
[1:03:42] always hid yourself in simplicity
[1:03:44] and you revealed yourself the same way
[1:03:46] and father i'm just happy that we are
[1:03:48] simple enough people to be able to
[1:03:49] receive
[1:03:50] how you come and the way you do things
[1:03:53] father i just pray that lord as we see
[1:03:56] the opening the renting of the veil and
[1:03:59] lord we are recognizing it's bidding us
[1:04:01] to come i pray lord that inside of us
[1:04:03] will recognize that you it's it's us
[1:04:06] your bidding
[1:04:07] and father we just thank you so much to
[1:04:09] see the things we're seeing and the time
[1:04:11] we're seeing them lord these things are
[1:04:14] going from a great mystery to something
[1:04:16] that was in the past to something we are
[1:04:17] now recognizing and seeing before us
[1:04:20] and father we just want to be faithful
[1:04:22] to walk
[1:04:23] lord you said
[1:04:24] you were asked once how may we work the
[1:04:26] works of god and you simply said believe
[1:04:28] on him whom i send
[1:04:30] and lord so many times we want to make
[1:04:31] it something other than just believing
[1:04:33] your present tense manifestation that's
[1:04:35] before us
[1:04:36] and lord god i just pray lord as time
[1:04:38] continues and you continue to walk with
[1:04:40] us and talk with us that you'll continue
[1:04:43] to whisper those little love secrets to
[1:04:45] us
[1:04:46] so that we'll clearly understand you and
[1:04:49] in understanding you we can see
[1:04:50] ourselves in you more clearly lord we
[1:04:53] sure love you we thank you for these
[1:04:55] times lord i just pray your blessings
[1:04:57] upon the people i pray lord that
[1:04:59] something was said that maybe could help
[1:05:01] somebody along the way
[1:05:03] lord and i just pray lord for our pastor
[1:05:05] may he return strengthened ready to go
[1:05:08] may his family return safely and all
[1:05:11] well and feeling good and lord we just

[1:05:26] god bless you i uh
[1:05:28] i i didn't mean to be long tonight i
[1:05:30] honestly thought well 30 40 minutes
[1:05:31] should be about enough so i accomplished
[1:05:34] that goal
[1:05:35] was everything okay
[1:05:37] it was okay sorry just it was different
[1:05:39] and i told you like a bible study
[1:05:40] tonight and i my daughter wanted

[1:05:44] you caught it it's the coming of the
[1:05:46] lord and he's bidding you to come and
