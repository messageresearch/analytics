[7:51] you all
[7:52] man it's good to be together
[7:54] amen it's good to love the word it's
[7:56] good to have the lord on your side amen
[7:59] amen let's take our bibles and turn to
[8:02] second peter
[8:04] and we'll just get right into the word
[8:06] if you read second peter
[8:09] chapter one
[8:12] i just want to give you an update i
[8:13] talked to brother gene yesterday and he
[8:15] got back home on friday so brother gene
[8:17] petrie is home
[8:19] in recovering he had a
[8:21] bad case of double pneumonia and he's
[8:23] still recovering he's still got a
[8:25] recovery ahead of him they sent him home
[8:26] with oxygen i didn't find out what he
[8:28] was using or how much he needed but but
[8:30] keep praying for him as recovers and
[8:32] also
[8:33] his daughter sonya is improving amen and
[8:35] so she's doing well and improving so we
[8:38] thank god for that she was able just to
[8:39] stay there at home and get better so
[8:41] praise god
[8:43] god is good we thank him for that
[8:45] also
[8:47] as we pray for the service this morning
[8:48] for the word we want to remember brother
[8:50] kyle brother kyle was preaching for
[8:52] brother eugene braun this morning
[8:54] in a lockdown with no airplane you know
[8:57] so brother eugene's church is in
[8:59] edmonton but he's preaching through
[9:01] skype or something like that and so
[9:04] it's a new experience you know he's done
[9:06] some bible studies and brother ron have
[9:08] done bible studies and skype to pakistan
[9:10] but he's going to take the sunday
[9:11] morning service in an empty room with a
[9:14] laptop
[9:16] and so he would definitely cover your
[9:17] prayers
[9:18] and so
[9:20] i had an invitation to do the same for a
[9:22] church in new zealand and i'm letting
[9:24] kyle go first to see how it works
[9:27] and then we'll then we'll pray about it
[9:28] and see what god wants us to do but this
[9:30] is a different world we live in it's
[9:32] unusual and god is getting on us getting
[9:35] us out of our comfort zones and putting
[9:36] us in uncomfortable places and we're
[9:38] finding out that the word works amen
[9:41] the word works and so let's look at
[9:43] first peter or second peter chapter 1
[9:45] verse 12.
[9:49] wherefore
[9:51] i will not be negligent to put you
[9:52] always in remembrance of these things
[9:55] though you know them and be established
[9:57] in the present truth
[9:59] with key on present truth
[10:02] they were established in something but
[10:04] it wasn't the past truth they were
[10:05] established in the present truth
[10:07] amen let's just bow our heads and pray
[10:09] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[10:11] jesus for this privilege
[10:13] to read your word lord and
[10:15] and just to be able to have a bible and
[10:17] literacy and an ability to read is a
[10:20] privilege in itself but god we're asking
[10:22] for more than this
[10:23] we're asking that you would come and
[10:24] give us divine revelation on your word
[10:27] that you would give us eyes have to see
[10:29] that you would open our understanding
[10:30] and reveal to us your word and lord and
[10:33] that we could place it in our lives and
[10:35] that we could live by it in this day
[10:37] we love you we pray to take preeminence
[10:39] among us and whether you would have your
[10:41] way in jesus name we pray amen god bless
[10:45] you as you're seated i want to thank
[10:46] sister naomi for that song that was a
[10:48] blessing
[10:49] man god is so good
[10:52] i want to
[10:54] take for a subject if we can this
[10:55] morning the worst sickness of all
[10:59] the worst sickness of all brother ben
[11:00] says in the message why 1961
[11:03] said i will say today they say the
[11:05] number one killer is heart disease i
[11:08] don't believe the number one killer is
[11:09] heart disease i believe number one
[11:11] killer is sin disease
[11:14] that's the killer that unbelief that's
[11:16] what's killing people we got the best
[11:18] doctors we ever had the best medicine we
[11:20] ever had certainly the best hospitals we
[11:22] ever had and the best medicines to
[11:24] practice with we've ever had and we got
[11:26] more sickness than we've ever had
[11:28] because we got more unbelief than we
[11:30] ever had
[11:32] that's exactly true see it is number one
[11:34] killer isn't heart trouble its sin
[11:36] trouble is the number one killer
[11:39] amen we believe that
[11:41] so the worst sickness of all to strike
[11:43] humanity amen it's not cancer it's not
[11:47] tuberculosis it's not leukemia it's not
[11:50] any of those things the work sickness is
[11:52] unbelief
[11:53] the worst thing that we could have is
[11:55] unbelief amen and the best thing that we
[11:57] could have is as a as a measure of faith
[12:00] that's been put into us by his grace as
[12:02] a gift of god to believe his word amen
[12:05] because unbelief will take your life
[12:07] amen unbelief will will will get will
[12:10] create everything that we see around us
[12:12] that's falling apart it is based on a
[12:14] civilization of unbelief but faith will
[12:16] get us out of all of it amen
[12:18] faith will give us the final victory
[12:20] that will free us from everything that
[12:22] unbelief has created
[12:24] amen brother bam says in the invisible
[12:26] union of the bride of christ
[12:28] what is sin sin is unbelief
[12:32] unbelief in what the word unbelief in
[12:35] god which is the word amen so this to
[12:38] disbelieve the word is to disbelieve god
[12:42] because god is the word
[12:44] amen all the way back to john chapter
[12:46] one verse one in the beginning was the
[12:47] word and the word was with god and the
[12:49] word was god amen and so god is the word
[12:52] amen and to disbelieve to word is to
[12:54] disbelieve god amen but but we realize
[12:57] that all the way down through time god
[12:59] has been unveiling his word and he's
[13:02] been portioning it out and measures
[13:04] through through the generations through
[13:06] the dispensations of time and salvation
[13:08] was always based on believing the word
[13:11] for your day
[13:13] it always has been through the entire
[13:15] bible nothing has changed amen salvation
[13:18] has always been by faith and the present
[13:21] truth
[13:22] if you look in noah's day salvation was
[13:25] faith in the present truth in abraham's
[13:27] day faith in the present truth moses day
[13:30] faith in the present truth amen all the
[13:32] way up all the way through the church
[13:34] ages it's always been based on faith in
[13:36] the present truth and today is no
[13:38] exception amen our salvation is based on
[13:41] faith in the present truth which is the
[13:43] word of god and when the word is made
[13:45] manifest it has to be believed amen when
[13:48] it's when it's disbelieved it's the same
[13:51] as rejecting god
[13:54] sin is unbelief
[13:56] unbelief in what the word unbelief in
[13:58] god which is the word let's go to
[14:02] hebrews chapter 11.
[14:05] i'd like to read several scriptures here
[14:07] close together
[14:09] hebrews chapter 11 and verse
[14:12] 1.
[14:19] now
[14:21] hebrews 11 and 1
[14:23] now faith is the substance of things
[14:24] hoped for
[14:26] the evidence of things not seen
[14:28] for by it the elders obtained a good
[14:31] report
[14:32] hallelujah how did all the elders get a
[14:35] good report by faith
[14:37] faith in what faith in the word as it
[14:40] was presented to them in their day amen
[14:44] this is so important i mean we've
[14:46] hounded this we know this this is
[14:48] something we talked about but it never
[14:50] changes it never goes away it's the fact
[14:52] that they they
[14:54] that all of the elders all the way down
[14:56] through and if you read the the hall of
[14:58] fame here chapter in hebrews 11 every
[15:01] one of them had to accept a
[15:03] manifestation of the word in their day
[15:05] and when they accepted that amen they
[15:07] were they were considered righteous they
[15:09] mean they they were saved by faith
[15:11] they've always been saved by faith we'll
[15:14] always be saved by faith amen so it's
[15:16] always salvation by faith but it was
[15:19] never their salvation by faith was never
[15:22] salvation in what god did in the
[15:24] generation before or what god had done
[15:26] in the previous dispensation their
[15:28] salvation by faith always came by what
[15:31] god was presenting to them that day and
[15:33] he was giving them a word that would
[15:35] save them if they would believe it
[15:38] a word that would deliver them from
[15:39] bondage a word amen that would deliver
[15:42] them from destruction a word that would
[15:44] save them if they would believe that
[15:46] present truth
[15:49] praise be to god let's look at verse six
[15:53] but without faith it is impossible to
[15:55] please him
[15:57] for he that cometh to god must believe
[15:59] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[16:02] them that diligently
[16:03] seek him
[16:05] man let's turn over to romans chapter
[16:07] four
[16:19] romans chapter four
[16:27] in verse 19.
[16:30] we're referring to abraham here and he
[16:33] says and being not weak in faith he
[16:36] considered not his own body now dead
[16:37] which he was about a hundred years old
[16:39] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[16:43] he staggered not at the promise of god
[16:45] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[16:47] giving glory to god and being fully
[16:50] persuaded that what he had promised he
[16:52] was
[16:53] able also to perform and therefore it
[16:56] was imputed to him for righteousness now
[16:58] it was not written for his sake alone
[17:00] that it was imputed to him but for us
[17:02] also to whom it shall be imputed if we
[17:05] believe on him that raised up jesus our
[17:07] lord from the dead
[17:09] so if you believe on him
[17:11] not you believe that jesus raised from
[17:13] the dead but if you believe on him that
[17:15] raised up jesus from the dead and who is
[17:17] the hymn it's god and the hymn is the
[17:20] word
[17:21] it's god the word so you must believe
[17:23] him amen and he is the word amen and how
[17:26] do you contact him he is the word amen
[17:29] that's presented in your day and that's
[17:31] how you come in contact with god
[17:34] if you can't you can't come in contact
[17:36] with god amen through the word that was
[17:38] presented in another day that was the
[17:40] contact for god in that day but your
[17:42] contact for god to that day is the word
[17:44] amen because he is the word the word is
[17:47] an expression of god and we contact god
[17:49] through the word that he's expressing in
[17:51] the day that we're living and that's our
[17:53] contact point to god
[17:56] amen and so when we believe that when
[17:58] when abraham come in contact with god
[18:00] and god gave him a promise and god told
[18:03] him something it was specific to the day
[18:05] that abraham was living in he wasn't
[18:07] referring abraham back to something that
[18:10] happened before but he was giving
[18:11] abraham a promise and a word to be
[18:13] fulfilled in that day and he presented
[18:15] to he presented to abraham a present
[18:18] truth and abraham believed god
[18:21] he believed god amen he believed god
[18:23] despite the impossibility of the things
[18:25] happening in him but he was not weak in
[18:27] faith and he staggered not at the
[18:29] promise but being strong in faith and he
[18:31] wasn't an unbeliever but he was a
[18:32] believer and because he believed god
[18:35] amen it was imputed unto him for
[18:36] righteousness not because abraham was
[18:39] righteous but because abraham believed
[18:41] god it was imputed into him or counted
[18:44] unto him or put upon him that he was
[18:46] righteous
[18:48] and not to him only amen so now if i
[18:51] want the imputation of righteousness
[18:54] it's not just believing what abraham
[18:56] believed because what abraham believed
[18:58] was god
[19:00] what did abraham believe he believed him
[19:02] who raised jesus christ from the dead
[19:05] before jesus christ was raised from the
[19:07] dead who was it that noah believed noah
[19:10] believed him who raised jesus from the
[19:12] dead or was it that moses believed moses
[19:14] believed him who raised jesus from the
[19:17] dead and who are we to believe we're to
[19:18] believe him who raised jesus from the
[19:21] dead
[19:22] and whatever way he presents himself to
[19:25] us we're asked to believe him
[19:28] praise be to god
[19:30] now let's go to the gospel of john
[19:32] chapter 8.
[19:36] so
[19:37] just note that it wasn't written for
[19:40] abraham's sake alone
[19:42] that righteousness was imputed unto him
[19:44] but for us
[19:46] who would believe the same way abraham
[19:48] believed
[19:50] praise god
[19:53] john 8
[19:56] 21
[19:58] then said jesus again unto them i go my
[20:01] way
[20:02] and you shall seek me and shall die in
[20:04] your sin whether i go you cannot come
[20:08] then said the jews will he kill himself
[20:10] because he saith whether i go you cannot
[20:12] come
[20:13] and he said unto him ye are from beneath
[20:16] i am from above year of this world i am
[20:18] not of this world i said therefore unto
[20:21] you that ye shall die in your sins for
[20:23] if you believe not that i am he ye shall
[20:26] die in your sins
[20:29] now for us this is an easy statement but
[20:31] just think of who he's speaking to in
[20:34] that day he is speaking to the most
[20:36] religious of the most religious he's
[20:38] speaking to the pharisees and and the
[20:40] jews and the jewish religion and he's
[20:42] looking at them and he's saying unless
[20:44] you believe that i am
[20:47] he says i am he but he is an italicized
[20:49] in the in the king james an authorized
[20:51] version meaning that those who had
[20:53] translated the bible inserted it there
[20:54] for clear understanding but what it
[20:56] really says unless you believe that i am
[20:58] you'll die in your sins
[21:00] unless you believe that i am unless you
[21:03] believe god unless you believe me
[21:05] because i am the manifestation of god
[21:09] i that what were they what were you
[21:11] asked to believe in to believe in him
[21:13] who would raise jesus from the dead
[21:14] which is what god amen god was standing
[21:17] there in front of them being represented
[21:19] in a body of flesh
[21:21] he said lest you believe in this
[21:23] dispensation unless you believe in this
[21:25] manifestation unless you believe i am he
[21:28] you shall die in your sins and these are
[21:30] people who were reading the bible every
[21:33] day these were scholars and teachers in
[21:35] the bible these were those who had
[21:37] learned the law of moses and taken all
[21:39] the additional things that had been
[21:41] added to the law of moses by all the
[21:43] rabbis down through time and they had
[21:45] compiled all the laws amen and they were
[21:47] washing pots and washing hands and not
[21:50] moving on the sabbath they had the
[21:52] religion and the order of religion down
[21:55] pat because they did not want to be
[21:57] sinners
[22:00] so they
[22:01] in order not to be a sinner they did not
[22:03] want to transgress the law amen so
[22:05] everything was about the order and the
[22:08] form of worship everything was about the
[22:10] rules and not to break the rules and how
[22:12] can we reinterpret the rule so that we
[22:15] can still be in the rule and still do
[22:17] what we want to do
[22:19] and they thought by lining up to
[22:22] ordinances
[22:24] that they would have no sin
[22:27] but jesus said
[22:29] if you line up to all the ordinances and
[22:32] do not believe that i am he you will die
[22:34] in your sins
[22:36] so you have to understand this the the
[22:39] the his congregation who he's speaking
[22:42] to he's speaking to people amen when
[22:44] when paul began to explain that he was a
[22:47] pharisee of the pharisees zealous jew he
[22:49] says as touching the law i was blameless
[22:53] and these are the kind of people jesus
[22:54] are talking to that that they could
[22:56] debate with him on that law and they
[22:58] could debate him on that word and say
[23:00] we've kept that and we've kept this and
[23:02] we've kept that amen when the rich young
[23:04] ruler came to jesus and he's saying what
[23:06] must i do to inherit eternal life he
[23:08] says you know the law you know obey
[23:10] father and mother and don't don't do
[23:12] these things and he says all of these
[23:14] have i done from my youth
[23:17] all of these have i done for my youth
[23:19] the man had kept all the ordinances and
[23:21] he's talking to jesus and he's confident
[23:23] i've done i've done every ordinance
[23:26] every rule i've done everything
[23:29] but jesus it says jesus loving him
[23:34] beloved loveth him
[23:36] said one thing not lacquest
[23:39] you've kept all the ordinance you've
[23:41] been a good boy you've kept the religion
[23:43] but one thing not lackist
[23:46] sell all that you have
[23:48] and come and follow me
[23:51] sell out everything
[23:54] and come follow me
[23:56] give up all your desires give up all
[23:59] your plans give up all your hopes sell
[24:02] out and follow me the manifested word
[24:04] for the hour
[24:06] there's the same the same thing's going
[24:08] on this morning the same opportunity you
[24:10] have somebody who can be raised right
[24:12] and raise understanding what god wants
[24:14] and what god likes and what he doesn't
[24:16] like but keeping all of those you can
[24:19] keep all of that and die in your sins
[24:22] because what god is doing in this day
[24:25] what he's presenting in this day if it
[24:27] goes rejected it's the same as rejecting
[24:29] him who raised jesus from the dead
[24:32] because the word is in a manifestation
[24:34] today and that manifestation today is
[24:37] christ in bright form
[24:40] and he's asking us to believe that he is
[24:42] here that he is present that he's in a
[24:45] mini-membered body
[24:49] but jesus says unless you believe that i
[24:51] am he
[24:52] you'll die in your sins
[24:54] and the smoke was rolling out of the
[24:56] ears
[24:57] because they worked overtime to prove
[24:59] they had no sins
[25:02] amen
[25:03] praise god because righteousness is
[25:05] imputed by faith
[25:08] amen and expressed in faith
[25:12] brother branham said in the anointed
[25:13] ones at the end time
[25:16] he said how can they be separate when he
[25:18] said i and my father are one except you
[25:21] believe that i am he you shall perish in
[25:22] your sins see your unbelief sin is
[25:25] unbelief you'll perish in your unbelief
[25:28] they would die because they didn't
[25:30] receive present truth
[25:33] die in sin
[25:35] jesus or brother also says what shall i
[25:37] do with jesus called christ in 1963 but
[25:40] what if you walk out there with the
[25:42] blood on your hands and rejecting
[25:45] and know that he'll hell lays before you
[25:47] eternal destruction crying for the rocks
[25:49] and the mountains but prayed for prayers
[25:52] for the prayers were too late in hebrews
[25:54] 10 if we sin willfully sin is unbelief
[25:59] if we unbelieve willfully after we have
[26:01] received the truth the knowledge of the
[26:03] truth
[26:04] you don't have to receive it just know
[26:06] about it you don't have to have it oh no
[26:09] see didn't say after we received the
[26:11] truth
[26:12] he goes back to the scripture he says if
[26:13] we send willfully after we receive the
[26:15] knowledge that it is the truth there we
[26:18] made us no more sacrifice or sins but a
[26:20] fearful looking for the firing the
[26:22] nation shall devour the adversary
[26:24] because god said vengeance is mine and i
[26:26] will recompense saith the lord
[26:28] brother says if we believe if if we
[26:31] disbelieve it willfully after the truth
[26:34] has been presented to us there will be
[26:36] no more mercy no more mercy will be
[26:39] granted
[26:40] why the brother member said the devil
[26:42] will let you know all that's been done
[26:43] before is just fine
[26:45] and you can believe all of it
[26:48] you know satan was working
[26:50] brother
[26:51] jesus christ when he looked at the
[26:53] pharisees he says i am of my father and
[26:55] you're of your father the devil
[26:59] so where was satan working satan was
[27:02] working right in the church
[27:04] in the religious realm in the religious
[27:06] leaders they were children of satan and
[27:09] satan was working in their midst
[27:13] so jesus was
[27:15] having a standoff
[27:18] between god and satan in the church
[27:21] not in the world in the church
[27:24] was where the showdown was coming where
[27:26] the standoff was
[27:28] he said
[27:29] after we disbelieve willfully after the
[27:31] truth has been presented to us there
[27:33] will be no more mercy
[27:34] no more mercy will be granted now
[27:37] i went back to say he said now he'll let
[27:40] you believe all that was before and here
[27:42] were these religious leaders children of
[27:45] the devil
[27:46] working on behalf of the devil satan's
[27:50] children satan's instruments amen that
[27:52] he had totally taken over
[27:54] and they could believe what moses had
[27:56] wrote in a book and they could carry it
[27:58] around and they could read from it and
[28:00] they could and all of that they could
[28:01] say is true the parting of the red sea
[28:04] true amen the crossing of jordan true
[28:07] moses being a prophet true the pillar of
[28:09] fire coming on true it's all true it's
[28:12] all true and satan had no problem with
[28:14] them believing everything that was in
[28:16] the scrolls that they carried around
[28:18] except for the part of the scroll that
[28:20] pointed to the manifestation of jesus
[28:23] christ being in flesh and when it come
[28:25] to present truth amen he moved them to
[28:28] reject the part of the scroll that they
[28:30] were carrying around that was pointing
[28:32] to jesus christ coming in the flesh
[28:35] but everything else he didn't care if
[28:37] they believed it he didn't care if they
[28:39] preached it he didn't care if they made
[28:41] sunday school literature about it he
[28:43] didn't care how much religious teaching
[28:45] they had on the bible as long as they
[28:48] didn't teach that part and believe that
[28:51] part to pertain to their present day
[28:53] [Applause]
[28:55] praise be to god has anything changed
[28:57] friends nothing has changed we're in the
[28:59] same scenario right here this morning
[29:02] right here today
[29:04] it's okay did jesus christ come check
[29:07] yes did he die on calvary yes did he
[29:09] raise again the third day it's all true
[29:11] amen was was paul amen a messenger was
[29:14] paul a prophet and an apostle yes check
[29:16] amen was peter and did he have the keys
[29:19] check check check amen you can believe
[29:21] it all you can make literature to prove
[29:23] it all amen you can debate it with
[29:25] atheists amen satan doesn't mind he's in
[29:28] that program
[29:30] he's in the program amen of printing
[29:32] books he's in the program of printing
[29:34] sunday school literature
[29:39] i mean it's the same thing as when jesus
[29:41] christ was here
[29:42] nothing's changed friends we we've got
[29:45] to quit thinking differently than the
[29:47] bible but we've got to let the bible
[29:49] paint the picture accurately for us and
[29:51] he's looking at them and they've got
[29:53] programs and they've got schools and
[29:55] they're teaching in the synagogues and
[29:57] these little kids are learning and
[29:59] memorizing scripture from the time
[30:00] they're tiny taught and the devil
[30:02] doesn't mind that they memorize the
[30:05] books of the bible
[30:07] the devil doesn't mind that they're
[30:09] taught every day by rabbis amen to to
[30:13] believe all the miracles that had taken
[30:15] place
[30:17] they didn't mind that they knew the
[30:19] events in the exodus journey in
[30:21] chronological order
[30:24] but don't you dare t teach the types and
[30:27] shadows that are pointing to this day
[30:29] don't you dare show back through there
[30:32] where he was hiding and laying in
[30:34] between the lines what would happen when
[30:36] jesus was here don't you explain that
[30:38] don't you teach that you just teach what
[30:41] happened but don't you ever teach what's
[30:42] happening
[30:45] and jesus says though you taught it all
[30:47] though you believe it all though you can
[30:49] recite it all but because you do not
[30:52] believe that i am you will die in your
[30:56] sins
[30:57] carrying your scrolls around and
[30:58] memorizing the bible and knowing every
[31:01] exploit that moses ever did
[31:06] god didn't send a prophet in our day for
[31:08] nothing friends
[31:10] amen god didn't call out a bride for
[31:12] nothing amen this is what he's doing
[31:14] this is his present truth this is the
[31:16] most wonderful thing that is happening
[31:18] on the earth is the thing that's
[31:19] happening when god is being made
[31:21] manifest in flesh and what flesh in your
[31:24] flesh and in my flesh and that's his
[31:26] program and that's his present day truth
[31:29] that's what he cares about amen that's
[31:31] what he's watching for can you receive
[31:34] that can you believe that
[31:38] go back to this quote
[31:40] if we disbelieve it willfully after the
[31:42] truth has been presented to us there
[31:44] will be no more mercy no more mercy will
[31:46] be granted pastor listening to this tape
[31:49] what about it member of church listening
[31:51] to this tape what about him what are you
[31:53] going to do if we disbelieve it
[31:55] willfully can't wash it off your hands
[31:57] you can't pass it on to the headquarters
[32:00] it's going to backfire right back to you
[32:03] you have heard it what about you how are
[32:05] you going to stand in that day
[32:07] he's either on your hands or in your
[32:10] heart one or the other god help us
[32:14] brother ma'am says
[32:16] in uh a greater than solomon is here
[32:18] from 1962
[32:20] the most horrible thing that there is
[32:22] friends is unbelief that's the only sin
[32:25] that there is
[32:26] the most horrible thing there is
[32:29] is unbelief
[32:31] can we get can we let that soak in
[32:34] and get to the place where we feel the
[32:35] same way
[32:36] the most horrible thing there is is
[32:39] unbelief
[32:40] the most the most detrimental thing to
[32:43] humanity is unbelief it is not poverty
[32:45] it is not sickness it is not war the
[32:48] most horrible thing is unbelief
[32:52] all of these things that we're taught
[32:54] are horrible amen and all the problems
[32:56] that we have to fix in the world will
[32:58] never be fixed by the measures they're
[33:00] using to fix them by amen because
[33:02] they're all based on unbelief and more
[33:05] measures of unbelief will never fix
[33:07] unbelief
[33:09] only cure is faith in god's word that's
[33:12] the only cure is faith in god's word and
[33:14] faith in present-day word
[33:17] that's the only cure
[33:19] he said
[33:20] that's the only sin that there is there
[33:22] is no other sin but unbelief i was
[33:24] preaching on that some years ago in a
[33:26] methodist church and it was a nice big
[33:27] methodist church and most of them are
[33:29] some of them believe in holiness and the
[33:31] the southern methodist
[33:33] and i was preaching about i said
[33:34] committing adultery is not a sin i said
[33:37] telling lies is not a sin taking the
[33:39] lord's name is not a sin
[33:41] that was just too much for some dear old
[33:43] sister sitting there her little collar
[33:45] got all up up around she said i pray you
[33:47] tell me what is sin
[33:49] that right she just couldn't hold it any
[33:51] longer i said sin is this my sister sin
[33:55] is unbelief
[33:57] they do those things they commit
[33:58] adultery they tell lies they do those
[34:00] things it's the attributes of unbelief
[34:04] so what we call sins are attributes of
[34:06] unbelief but the real sin is unbelief
[34:09] and because of unbelief these other
[34:11] things come out
[34:14] if they were believers they wouldn't do
[34:16] those things they're unbelievers that's
[34:18] the reason they do it it's just the
[34:20] attributes proving that they are
[34:21] unbelievers
[34:23] the scripture plainly teaches us that he
[34:25] that believeth not is condemned already
[34:28] see you can't even get started so the
[34:31] most horrible thing there is is unbelief
[34:35] let's turn to hebrews chapter 3 together
[34:52] i'd like to say this
[34:54] the most horrible thing we're facing in
[34:56] our day is unbelief
[34:58] not coronavirus
[35:00] not
[35:01] poverty
[35:02] not political unrest not uncertainty
[35:05] with china not economic downfall
[35:08] all of that is taken care of by faith
[35:11] every one of those things can be
[35:13] provided for by faith but the most
[35:15] terrible thing we're facing the most
[35:17] detrimental thing is unbelief
[35:19] so as believers as children of god we've
[35:22] got to be careful we don't get swept up
[35:24] into the move
[35:26] amen where people are moving in and this
[35:28] is terrible and this is terrible there's
[35:31] terrible things poverty is terrible
[35:33] famine is terrible war is terrible they
[35:35] are terrible things but let's come back
[35:37] to the realization of what the real core
[35:40] root cause of all the horrible things
[35:42] are and the real problem is unbelief
[35:45] it started with when eve disbelieved one
[35:48] word amen in unbelief continues to
[35:50] mitigate or continues to increase every
[35:53] problem that we're facing is based off
[35:55] unbelief
[35:57] amen and civilization in science and
[36:00] education is all of the devil and based
[36:03] on unbelief and satan's eden is as a
[36:06] civilization founded rooted based and
[36:08] propagated on unbelief
[36:13] so none of those things can help us
[36:17] you realize
[36:18] education science civilization can't
[36:21] help us the only thing that can help us
[36:23] is faith in god
[36:25] believing god
[36:27] wherever he is whenever he's presented
[36:29] in whatever form he comes whether it's
[36:31] print on paper or a brother standing in
[36:33] front of you believe god
[36:37] amen
[36:39] says
[36:40] verse
[36:41] let's look at verse 17 hebrews 3 and 17
[36:46] but with whom was he greed 40 years was
[36:48] it not with them that had sinned whose
[36:50] carcass fell in the wilderness
[36:52] and whom swear he that they should not
[36:54] enter into his rest but to them that
[36:57] believe not
[36:58] so we see that they could not enter in
[37:00] because of unbelief
[37:03] verse chapter four verse one let us
[37:05] therefore fear lest the promise being
[37:08] left of us entering into his rest any of
[37:10] you should seem to come short of it for
[37:12] unto us was the gospel priest as well as
[37:15] unto them
[37:16] but the word preached did not profit
[37:18] them not being mixed with faith
[37:21] in that in them that heard it
[37:23] so now oh what a key we have here in the
[37:26] scriptures
[37:27] these are the children of israel god's
[37:29] people
[37:30] it promised seed the the promise of
[37:33] abraham the descendants of abraham and
[37:35] of jacob amen they go down and get in
[37:37] bondage amen just like god said and he
[37:40] leads them out with a mighty hand he
[37:41] sends a mighty prophet and that mighty
[37:43] prophet has
[37:45] excuse me has the word he takes the word
[37:47] and he gives it to the people and by a
[37:49] pillar of fire and supernatural sign and
[37:51] a mighty hand he leads them out of egypt
[37:53] and he leads them along teaching them
[37:55] the word of god as they go
[37:58] and yet they perished
[38:01] in the wilderness
[38:02] because they couldn't believe
[38:06] they didn't doubt the parting of the red
[38:08] sea
[38:11] they didn't doubt the fire and the cloud
[38:13] coming down on sinai they didn't doubt
[38:16] moses being the prophet they didn't
[38:18] doubt god speaking to moses they didn't
[38:20] doubt the plagues they didn't doubt any
[38:22] of those things none of that was doubted
[38:25] they doubted the promise
[38:28] they doubted the word the present tense
[38:31] word that was given to them they
[38:32] rejected that word and when they
[38:34] rejected that word they died in the
[38:37] wilderness because of unbelief
[38:41] so you realize amen
[38:45] when when when the rich man dies and
[38:47] lazarus dies they go into the grave the
[38:50] lazarus goes into abraham's bosom and
[38:52] the rich man goes into hell and he lifts
[38:53] up his eyes amen from hell and he cries
[38:56] out and he asks god if he could just let
[38:58] lazarus dip his finger quench his tongue
[39:00] they have this dialogue jesus is talking
[39:02] about this and he says
[39:05] let him go back let lazarus go back and
[39:07] tell my brethren so that they will
[39:09] believe and he says though one raised
[39:11] from the dead they'll not believe
[39:15] though we part the red sea they'll not
[39:17] believe listen it's not that they didn't
[39:19] believe the parting of the red sea they
[39:21] believed the parting of the red sea they
[39:23] didn't believe all the word
[39:28] this is important friends
[39:30] this is really important because they
[39:32] walked along they could chronicle in
[39:34] their journal everybody walked through
[39:36] the red sea today it was amazing stood
[39:38] on the right hand in the left hand like
[39:39] a wall i mean i couldn't believe it i
[39:41] could see fish swimming behind in the
[39:43] water
[39:45] i mean you could you imagine we're
[39:47] dramatizing but could you imagine the
[39:49] stories that would tell they said did
[39:51] you see that big fish on the left-hand
[39:52] side when we walked through and did you
[39:53] feel how dry the ground was the water
[39:55] just moved it was dry
[39:57] not one of them doubted the parting of
[39:59] the red sea
[40:01] but that was not enough to get them to
[40:03] believe all the word
[40:06] because faith was going to meet a
[40:08] challenge amen and the only thing that
[40:10] was going to rise to the occasion rise
[40:12] to the challenge was a genuine faith in
[40:14] the heart
[40:17] the superficial faith that comes from
[40:19] seeing is not enough
[40:24] the superficial faith that comes from
[40:27] seeing
[40:28] is not enough
[40:32] that's why i love the testimonies of
[40:34] brother branham
[40:36] they're a vindication of his ministry
[40:38] and that he was called and what god had
[40:40] told him was vindicated and proven
[40:42] but the testimony books is not enough
[40:47] the the you we realized that we realize
[40:50] now that the testimonies aren't enough
[40:52] because when somebody begins to question
[40:54] the testimonies
[40:56] like how many people fell off a bridge
[40:59] and you know whether or not you know how
[41:01] how his brother died and whether or not
[41:03] this
[41:04] well i don't remember know them all you
[41:06] guys probably know him better than i did
[41:08] but when people begin to question and
[41:10] cast doubt on the miracles and cast
[41:12] doubt on some of the healing and some of
[41:14] the miracles and we can question you
[41:16] know the date that a cloud was there and
[41:18] what made a cloud and all of that you
[41:20] realize people's faith began to crumble
[41:23] because their faith was based on the
[41:25] part they could see
[41:28] and when you cast a doubt on the part
[41:30] that can be seen faith began to crumble
[41:33] and collapse and show that there was
[41:35] nothing there in the soul to believe
[41:37] with it was an intellectual faith based
[41:40] on hearing and based on seeing
[41:43] and we need a faith that's greater than
[41:45] a faith based off hearing and on seeing
[41:47] but we need a faith that goes all the
[41:49] way back to before the foundation of the
[41:51] world when the attribute of me was
[41:53] seated in god
[41:55] and the mind of god and that's the faith
[41:57] that will overcome in this day and it'll
[41:59] believe without seeing it'll believe
[42:01] when everything goes wrong it'll believe
[42:03] when your world gets turned upside down
[42:05] that's what had paul and silas singing
[42:08] in prison after they'd been arrested and
[42:10] they'd been beaten they met and they had
[42:11] stripes on their back and they were
[42:13] hanged and they were handcuffed to the
[42:15] wall and they were singing out why
[42:17] because that the obstacle the the
[42:20] detrimental position they were in didn't
[42:23] change the faith that was in their heart
[42:28] you see friends
[42:29] god's the one who's in control of all
[42:31] these circumstances but don't believe
[42:32] that faith will not be tested
[42:35] faith will be tested faith will be
[42:36] challenged because god knows that
[42:39] unbelief has to be rooted out and only
[42:41] faith will win the day
[42:43] this is the victory that overcome with
[42:45] the world even our faith
[42:49] and that's a gift of god
[42:51] residing in the attribute in the soul
[42:54] the seed gene of god the ability to
[42:56] believe
[42:57] so god in order to make sure only his
[43:00] children make it all the way through
[43:02] he flips everything upside down he does
[43:04] the opposite amen he he breaks
[43:08] everything apart to make sure only his
[43:10] believing children make it through
[43:11] because the promise is to those that
[43:13] endure to the end so he's going to make
[43:14] sure that the only way that we're going
[43:17] to endure to the end is that we have
[43:18] genuine faith in the word of god
[43:21] a faith that's god's own faith not even
[43:25] our own faith but god's own faith which
[43:27] has been planted in me
[43:29] [Music]
[43:30] so don't worry about things going wrong
[43:32] that's a good thing
[43:34] god's just shaving down the crowd
[43:37] god's just thinning out unbelief because
[43:39] what he wants is faith
[43:41] he wants faith he wants faith in his
[43:44] present tense word
[43:48] so it's amazing sometimes
[43:50] you go to do something by faith
[43:52] and everything goes completely wrong
[43:57] praise god
[43:58] i want to ask you a question what's
[44:00] changed
[44:01] if you feel led of god anointed by god
[44:04] and you see the word of god and you move
[44:06] forward by faith in god and faith in the
[44:08] word of god you see your position in the
[44:10] word you feel the anointing of god you
[44:12] feel the leadership of god and you move
[44:13] forward and all of a sudden the bottom
[44:16] falls out the walls fall on and you find
[44:18] yourself in absolute chaos and ruin i
[44:21] wouldn't get excited because nothing's
[44:23] changed
[44:25] nothing's changed we don't we don't it's
[44:27] not by sight but by faith we don't
[44:30] believe in what we see we believe in
[44:32] what he said
[44:34] and what he said will never change
[44:36] based off what we see amen when it looks
[44:39] worse many times it's getting better
[44:43] that's been all through the bible
[44:45] friends
[44:46] that's why when we read the bible's
[44:47] flannel graph sunday school stories we
[44:49] miss the whole point but when we believe
[44:51] it as real life events that happen to
[44:53] real people just like you and i
[44:55] all of a sudden it starts to come home
[44:57] and you say hey that's what i'm going
[44:59] through right now this is the sec exact
[45:01] same circumstances i'm in right now this
[45:04] thing that noah went through i'm right
[45:05] there this thing that moses went through
[45:07] and that that paul's going through i'm
[45:09] right in the same place
[45:13] that's a good place to be
[45:15] so now
[45:16] they
[45:18] let's look back at verse one chapter
[45:20] four verse one
[45:22] let us therefore fear lest the promise
[45:24] being left us of entering into his rest
[45:27] any of you should seem to come short of
[45:28] him for unto us was the gospel preached
[45:31] as well as unto them
[45:33] so the gospel was preached unto them
[45:36] right
[45:37] this goes to show that the gospel is not
[45:40] just jesus died on a cross and was
[45:42] resurrected
[45:43] because the gospel was preached unto
[45:44] them and he says the gospel is preached
[45:47] unto us the same as it's preached unto
[45:50] them
[45:51] amen
[45:52] now you notice he didn't say the same
[45:54] gospel
[45:56] but he said the gospels preached unto us
[45:57] the same as it was preached unto them
[45:59] they received the gospel
[46:02] paul received the gospel and we've
[46:04] received the gospel
[46:06] and the names and the dates and things
[46:09] can change but it's the gospel which
[46:11] means the good news and the good news is
[46:14] what god is doing in your day
[46:17] that's the good news the good news the
[46:19] gospel is what god is doing today that's
[46:22] the good news
[46:24] remember he doesn't mind that you can
[46:26] believe that jesus died on a cross and
[46:29] then that you can print t-shirts amen
[46:31] and declaring that you believe jesus
[46:33] died on a cross he doesn't mind you
[46:35] believing that satan doesn't mind you
[46:37] believe that the whole church can
[46:39] believe that you can write books upon it
[46:41] and preach a series of sermons upon it
[46:43] and there's nothing wrong with it it's
[46:44] the word
[46:46] but he doesn't mind you believing that
[46:48] but he does not want you to believe that
[46:50] he is the smitten rock smitten again in
[46:52] this day when the word came and was
[46:54] rejected
[46:57] you believe that but don't believe this
[47:00] amen
[47:03] so
[47:04] so now
[47:05] the gospel was preached to them paul
[47:07] says is the same as it was gospels
[47:09] preached the same as it was to them what
[47:11] was their gospel their gospel was
[47:13] deliverance out of bondage out of egypt
[47:15] and taken to a promised land
[47:17] guess what that's the same gospel paul's
[47:19] preaching only he's not talking about a
[47:21] physical egypt and a physical land but
[47:23] he's talking about coming out of
[47:25] religion and going into christ
[47:27] now brother branham would come and he
[47:29] would preach the same thing paul
[47:30] preached because he's preaching the
[47:31] gospel and he's preaching about coming
[47:33] out of the denominational religion
[47:35] coming out of denominations and going
[47:36] into christ
[47:38] it's the gospel friends the gospel is
[47:40] the good news the good news is what god
[47:43] is doing in your day
[47:45] i mean that was good news and i'm happy
[47:47] for them in that day but i've got to
[47:49] have a gospel for my day i've got to
[47:51] have a good news today
[47:54] not what was good news previously but
[47:56] what's good news now friends what is the
[47:58] good news now where is god now where is
[48:01] the manifestation of the word today
[48:07] but see
[48:08] they received the gospel was preaching
[48:12] for unto us was the gospel preached
[48:13] verse 2 as well as unto them but the
[48:16] word preached did not profit them
[48:18] not being mixed with faith
[48:22] and then they heard it
[48:24] they had the gospel preached
[48:27] and they heard it
[48:29] but they missed one ingredient
[48:32] faith
[48:34] they had a prophet
[48:35] they had miracles
[48:37] they had deliverance they had manna that
[48:39] came from heaven they had a water that
[48:41] sprung out of a rock they had every
[48:43] provision they needed
[48:46] i should say it this way they had
[48:48] everything they needed to believe with
[48:51] except to see gene
[48:55] everything carnally
[48:58] could was provided to make a believer
[49:01] oh
[49:02] i love this
[49:03] we got 1200 tapes we got living
[49:06] testimonies we've got recorded
[49:08] testimonies we got picture books
[49:13] we've got churches all over the world
[49:14] we've got preaching going on on
[49:16] wednesdays and sundays and now preaching
[49:18] via
[49:19] remote you know skype and all these
[49:21] other things in zoom going all over
[49:23] we've got everything that we need to
[49:26] have a believer in this day
[49:28] but the only way to have a believer in
[49:30] this day is if somebody's got a receiver
[49:33] down on the inside to receive all of
[49:35] this that's here
[49:38] we've done a great job and there's no
[49:39] fault in doing a great job we should
[49:41] have put all our effort into spreading
[49:42] the message all of our effort into
[49:43] gathering the testimonies all of our
[49:45] effort into recording them we should do
[49:47] that that's a good thing but that's not
[49:49] enough
[49:52] all of that can only lay on the surface
[49:55] but there's got to be something down
[49:56] under the service that can reach up and
[49:58] connect to that there's got to be a
[50:00] faith amen they had the gospel preached
[50:02] they had the signs and wonders but it
[50:05] wasn't mixed with faith because there
[50:06] was no faith to mix it with
[50:10] where did they get it where did it come
[50:11] from
[50:13] caleb and joshua will walk the same path
[50:15] they come out of the same bondage they
[50:17] heard the same preaching
[50:19] they saw the same miracles they they
[50:21] experienced all the same experiences
[50:26] god
[50:28] they
[50:28] they they did everything that the
[50:31] unbeliever did joshua and caleb did
[50:34] all the good and the bad and the hunger
[50:37] and the thirst and the water and and the
[50:39] quail i mean they went through
[50:41] everything everybody else went through
[50:43] everything laid here the same but there
[50:45] was one difference that there was
[50:47] something inside caleb and joshua that
[50:49] could believe
[50:53] let's go let's go back let's just turn
[50:55] back real quickly to
[50:56] to uh numbers 14.
[51:04] i'll get a little bit out of sequence
[51:05] maybe
[51:07] but that's okay
[51:10] numbers 14.
[51:13] they come to cadis barnea the spies go
[51:15] over joshua and caleb are two of those
[51:17] spies they come back to ten given evil
[51:20] report
[51:22] now the ten
[51:24] they weren't necessarily lying
[51:26] they were saying there's giants there's
[51:28] walled cities there's a bunch of people
[51:31] and this is really a tough place
[51:34] and that may have been every word the
[51:36] truth
[51:38] but they weren't speaking truth
[51:43] it's amazing
[51:44] you can say every word true and lie
[51:50] or you can mess up all your words and
[51:51] get all the details wrong and say it
[51:53] wrong and still be telling the truth
[51:55] brother branham did it all the time
[51:59] so
[52:01] they they had the facts right they come
[52:04] with a sheet of facts
[52:06] and these facts would would hit the
[52:08] reasoning cardinal logical mind
[52:12] of a people
[52:14] logically
[52:16] a people who were slaves
[52:19] with no weapons
[52:21] with no training
[52:22] can't take a walled city
[52:25] where you can ride chariots around the
[52:27] walls you remember the venom describing
[52:29] this
[52:30] it doesn't matter how many of them are
[52:32] how are you going to take a walled city
[52:34] amen that you can ride chariots around
[52:35] you have no armament you have no weapons
[52:38] you have no training you've been slaves
[52:40] for 400 years you've been in egypt for
[52:42] 400 years you've been in bondage for a
[52:44] number of those years you come out you
[52:46] don't have any skill in fighting you
[52:48] don't have any weaponry how are you
[52:51] going to do this so they come and they
[52:52] listed the facts walt cities giants i
[52:55] mean of course yeah there's big fruit i
[52:57] mean it's wonderful
[52:59] it's wonderful it's land that flows with
[53:01] milk and honey here's the fruit of the
[53:03] land it's a wonderful place but but but
[53:07] oh my goodness
[53:10] when it comes to the word of god leave
[53:12] the butt out
[53:14] that's right it's a wonderful promise
[53:16] that's right it's a wonderful this
[53:18] that's right he's your healer but
[53:21] oh leave that out friends
[53:24] he comes to the they come back and they
[53:26] yes it's this and it's that but
[53:28] there's giants walled cities armies
[53:32] and then this is where they took truth
[53:34] and made it a lie
[53:37] but we're not able to take it
[53:40] but we can't take it that's where
[53:42] reasoning
[53:44] injected a lie
[53:46] because that wasn't the truth
[53:49] they were looking at their ability and
[53:52] said i can't take it and it was never
[53:54] based on their ability but always based
[53:56] on his promised word
[53:59] they come here in chapter 14 verse 1.
[54:04] it says in all the congregation lifted
[54:06] up their voice and cried
[54:07] and the people wept that night because
[54:09] of what the ten spies had said
[54:12] and all the children of israel murmured
[54:14] against moses and against aaron and the
[54:15] whole congregation said unto them
[54:18] would god that we had died in the land
[54:20] of egypt or would god we had died in the
[54:22] wilderness
[54:24] look at what they're saying
[54:26] they were marching freedom coming from
[54:28] freedom to their own land and now they
[54:31] wish they had died in egypt or died in
[54:33] the wilderness
[54:37] and there wherefore hath the lord
[54:39] brought us unto this land to fall by the
[54:41] sword that our wives and our children
[54:42] should be a prey were it not better for
[54:45] us to return into egypt
[54:47] and they said one to another let us make
[54:49] a captain and let us return to egypt you
[54:51] know what we're looking at friends
[54:54] reasoning
[54:55] we're looking at a human mind based on
[54:58] reasoning and the solution to their
[55:01] problem was to make their own captain
[55:03] they had a captain it was the pillar of
[55:05] fire amen leading through moses and but
[55:07] they wanted to make their own captain
[55:09] and go back into egypt because now they
[55:11] thought they were going to die
[55:14] and they said one to another let us make
[55:16] a captain and let us return into egypt
[55:18] now here's the part that amazes me
[55:21] i just i don't know why god wires his
[55:23] believers different we look at things
[55:25] differently
[55:26] if they said oh i wish i would have died
[55:28] in egypt or i wish i would have died in
[55:30] the wilderness
[55:32] my question is why don't you go and take
[55:34] the land and die there
[55:38] why not try
[55:40] you know why not be a real believer
[55:42] why not just say well uh oh it would
[55:45] have been better if i had died in egypt
[55:47] it would have been better so if you wish
[55:48] you was already dead give it a shot go
[55:50] for broke take him at his word jump
[55:52] forward into the battle and if they kill
[55:54] you you get your wish
[55:57] just be a believer quit this carnal hey
[56:00] what happens if you believe and you die
[56:01] praise god i'm in the sixth dimension i
[56:03] don't care
[56:04] but i'm going to take him at his word
[56:06] i'm not listening to your reasoning
[56:09] it doesn't matter to me what you think
[56:11] and all the facts that you have and all
[56:13] the oh how terrible it is and how likely
[56:15] it is we're gonna die amen i don't value
[56:18] my life on this earth anyways i'm here
[56:21] for his purpose not my purpose and i'm
[56:23] not going anywhere until his purpose for
[56:25] me is accomplished that's what the
[56:27] prophet of god said is it true or is it
[56:29] not true the scripture says the
[56:30] footsteps of a righteous are ordered to
[56:32] the lord he says we are his workmanship
[56:34] created in christ jesus unto good works
[56:36] that he hath ordained we should walk in
[56:37] them so those things that he's listed
[56:40] for me to do as i'm ordained to do i
[56:42] will do
[56:44] [Music]
[56:48] if that means die believing his word
[56:50] then it was ordained for me to do it
[56:54] nothing's going to happen in the life of
[56:56] a believer unless it first crosses his
[56:58] desk and he signs off on it
[57:01] so when we come to obstacles that are
[57:03] impossible when we come to things that
[57:05] look you know certain destruction if
[57:08] it's in his word if his word said
[57:09] forward then go forward
[57:13] why because i mean you wish you were
[57:15] dead anyways
[57:19] i mean i
[57:20] it's a good thing i wasn't there that
[57:22] day
[57:24] because i would ask the question so
[57:25] what's the big deal what's the problem
[57:27] oh you know you know we wish we would
[57:29] have died hey if that's what you want
[57:32] follow me
[57:35] let's go to the promised land let's take
[57:37] him at his
[57:38] word see god he he wanted something
[57:43] different in this reasoning
[57:45] than this human
[57:46] i mean in all their reasoning and wisdom
[57:48] they're so unreasonable
[57:51] they're so ridiculous i wish i was dead
[57:54] then what are you worried about
[57:56] why did you bring us here that we might
[57:57] die you just said you wish you were dead
[58:01] and so in all the wisdom and man and
[58:04] reasoning of man he becomes an absolute
[58:06] fool
[58:08] and then the best idea he's got
[58:11] is let's make us a captain and let's go
[58:13] back into bondage where we came from
[58:16] and they have been crying
[58:18] to get out of there they've been crying
[58:20] when god came down and talked to moses
[58:22] in the burning bush he said i've heard
[58:23] the cries of my people and i've come
[58:25] down they were crying to get out of
[58:27] egypt now the best solution they got
[58:30] with human reasoning and science and
[58:31] education and all that man could come up
[58:34] with their best solution to the problem
[58:36] amen was let's make a captain and go
[58:38] back to egypt
[58:40] oh i say caleb had the best solution to
[58:43] the problem let's keep going forward
[58:45] friends
[58:46] that's the best solution
[58:50] amen he says now
[58:53] verse 4 and they said one to another let
[58:55] us make a captain and let us return into
[58:57] egypt and moses and aaron fell on their
[59:00] faces before all the assembly and the
[59:02] congregation of the children of israel
[59:04] and joshua the son of nun and caleb the
[59:06] son of jephena
[59:08] which were of them of them that searched
[59:10] the land rent their clothes and they
[59:12] spake unto all the company of the
[59:14] children of israel saying the land which
[59:16] we pass through to search it is an
[59:18] exceeding good land
[59:20] if the lord delight in us then he will
[59:22] bring us into this land and give it us a
[59:25] land which floweth with milk and honey
[59:28] only rebel not ye against the lord
[59:30] neither fear ye the people of the land
[59:32] for they are bred for us their defenses
[59:34] departed from them and the lord is with
[59:36] us fear them not
[59:39] what was he looking at
[59:41] they had walked through the same land
[59:43] they had saw the same cities they had
[59:45] witnessed the same giants but they saw
[59:48] something totally different
[59:50] the ten spies they walked through and
[59:52] saw a walled city and they say
[59:53] impenetrable
[59:55] they walked and they see giants amen and
[59:58] they said we can't defeat giants and
[1:00:00] caleb looks at giants and say if there's
[1:00:02] enough food to feed them big boys i can
[1:00:04] feed my family
[1:00:08] if this land will support giants it'll
[1:00:10] support my tribe
[1:00:14] see faith looks at the picture totally
[1:00:16] different
[1:00:17] than what unbelief amen that's the same
[1:00:19] picture they're looking at the same
[1:00:20] thing and seeing two totally different
[1:00:22] things
[1:00:25] there's a giant he'll kill me no he
[1:00:27] won't kill me god already promised give
[1:00:28] me this land but you know how much food
[1:00:30] he eats
[1:00:31] do you know how much food his children
[1:00:33] need do you know how big his garden
[1:00:34] probably is and it's already planted
[1:00:36] friends let's go kill him amen can you
[1:00:39] imagine how many tomato plants he put
[1:00:41] out this year
[1:00:44] free food
[1:00:45] we feed four families
[1:00:49] oh
[1:00:50] faith overcomes every obstacle
[1:00:53] faith sees the promise of god faith will
[1:00:56] conquer they will crest every wave
[1:01:01] so they're looking at something totally
[1:01:02] different verse 9 only rebellion you're
[1:01:04] not against the lord neither fear ye the
[1:01:06] people of the land for they are bred for
[1:01:08] us they just said the other ten said
[1:01:11] we're grasshoppers in their sight
[1:01:13] they saw themselves as grasshoppers in
[1:01:15] their side but joshua and caleb saw them
[1:01:18] as bread
[1:01:22] they're bred for us their defenses
[1:01:24] departed from them and the lord is with
[1:01:26] us fear them not but all the
[1:01:28] congregation bade stone them with stones
[1:01:30] and the glory of the lord appeared in
[1:01:32] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:01:33] before the children of israel
[1:01:35] so the most sensible thing that had been
[1:01:38] said yet was what joshua and caleb said
[1:01:41] but the response to that was let's stone
[1:01:43] them
[1:01:45] they're speaking the word they're
[1:01:46] speaking faith in the word they're
[1:01:48] actually believing that what god said is
[1:01:51] true they are actually believing that we
[1:01:54] should go up and take this land they
[1:01:56] actually believe them giants are bred
[1:01:58] for us and they actually believe their
[1:01:59] defenses are melted away they actually
[1:02:02] believe what they heard moses say god
[1:02:04] said
[1:02:06] so there's only one solution for us and
[1:02:08] that's to kill them
[1:02:11] why is it when jesus told the truth the
[1:02:13] only solution they had was to kill him
[1:02:16] why is it when paul told the truth the
[1:02:18] only solution they had was to kill him
[1:02:21] why because the devil doesn't want
[1:02:24] anybody to believe the gospel the
[1:02:26] present good news
[1:02:28] because it exposes all of his tactics of
[1:02:30] reasoning and science and education and
[1:02:33] civilization all crumble in the face of
[1:02:36] faith
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:43] god is good
[1:02:46] i want to be a real believer
[1:02:51] and i
[1:02:52] would rather
[1:02:54] die
[1:02:55] trying to take hebron where the giants
[1:02:57] were
[1:02:58] than die
[1:03:00] trying to make a captain to go back to
[1:03:02] egypt
[1:03:03] i would rather lose my life on the word
[1:03:05] of god than to save my life by rejecting
[1:03:08] the word of god and trying to protect
[1:03:10] myself amen and make myself safe and
[1:03:12] secure and free from all harm but reject
[1:03:15] the word of god
[1:03:17] i say let me believe the word of god and
[1:03:19] it leaves me exposed and it leaves me
[1:03:21] exposed but i believe the word of god
[1:03:26] because egypt's not going to help me
[1:03:28] if i go back to egypt i go back to what
[1:03:30] i was in egypt
[1:03:31] a slave
[1:03:35] if i had died in the wilderness you know
[1:03:37] what it's like to die in the wilderness
[1:03:40] oh we died in egypt to redine in the
[1:03:41] wilderness
[1:03:43] that's like saying i wish i would have
[1:03:45] died back when the message was easy
[1:03:48] before i came to the final showdown when
[1:03:51] my faith was actually going to have to
[1:03:52] be put to the test
[1:03:56] i wish i would have died a seeming
[1:03:58] believer along the way
[1:04:00] than to have it really put the test to
[1:04:01] prove whether i am or not
[1:04:08] it's the truth anyhow
[1:04:11] it's the truth if it cuts me to the
[1:04:12] heart it's the truth anyhow
[1:04:16] i wish i had died in egypt i wish i had
[1:04:18] died along the way
[1:04:19] because now i wouldn't be exposed as an
[1:04:22] unbeliever when things begin to get
[1:04:24] tense
[1:04:25] when the word actually has to be on
[1:04:27] display and it has to put me in a
[1:04:29] position where i'm vulnerable
[1:04:32] when the word begins to put me in a
[1:04:34] position where my faith is going to be
[1:04:35] put to the test and vulnerability is
[1:04:37] going to come out and consequences for
[1:04:39] believing are going to come to the
[1:04:41] surface i could say i wish that i had a
[1:04:43] nice message funeral amen back 10 years
[1:04:46] ago when everything was fine and there
[1:04:48] was no pressure and i couldn't see
[1:04:50] things picking up in pace and getting
[1:04:51] more intense and more intense and more
[1:04:53] intense why couldn't have i just died
[1:04:55] and they buried me as a believer instead
[1:04:57] of standing here in this day at the
[1:04:58] showdown to where i was going to be
[1:05:00] proven what i really am
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:05] it's the truth
[1:05:06] friends i said god make me a believer
[1:05:10] oh i just want to be like that man who
[1:05:12] come to jesus with the epileptic child
[1:05:15] and he says does thou believe he says i
[1:05:16] believe help thou my unbelief
[1:05:19] lord i'm a believer but give me more
[1:05:21] amen unlock more to me amen i need more
[1:05:24] amen what i have is not enough amen
[1:05:26] you've got to unlock more that's down
[1:05:28] there
[1:05:29] i don't want to be weak in the faith but
[1:05:30] i want to be strong in the faith i don't
[1:05:32] want any unbelief left in me wash it out
[1:05:34] oh god i believe helped out my unbelief
[1:05:39] amen i can't help it friends i believe
[1:05:43] god help me you believe we believe let's
[1:05:46] believe
[1:05:50] praise be to god
[1:05:54] i say it like this unbelief hides in
[1:05:56] unusual places
[1:06:00] unbelief hides in religion
[1:06:05] because
[1:06:06] jesus
[1:06:07] he could look at the pharisees
[1:06:10] and he says
[1:06:11] unless you believe i am he
[1:06:13] unless you believe i am
[1:06:15] you'll die in your sins
[1:06:17] and he was exposing that though they
[1:06:19] look good on the outside he says you're
[1:06:21] like a sepulcher white washed on the
[1:06:23] outside and inside you're full of dead
[1:06:25] men's bones
[1:06:27] and where was unbelief hiding it was
[1:06:30] hiding in religion
[1:06:32] and and listen
[1:06:34] the greatest unbelievers
[1:06:37] were the pharisees
[1:06:38] the sadducees the
[1:06:40] the the council amongst them were some
[1:06:42] of the greatest unbelievers in the
[1:06:44] promised word of god and all of judea
[1:06:47] and all of jerusalem
[1:06:48] was right there
[1:06:50] so
[1:06:51] unbelief hides in unusual places
[1:06:54] i'll put it like this
[1:06:58] because
[1:06:59] religion is a good place for unbelief to
[1:07:01] hide
[1:07:03] unbelief will climb to the highest
[1:07:06] heights in religion
[1:07:10] because if it's a good mask for unbelief
[1:07:14] satan is hiding behind the mask
[1:07:17] and he's going to climb to the highest
[1:07:19] heights of religion
[1:07:21] that's what jesus faced
[1:07:25] so unbelief hides in unusual places but
[1:07:27] if you read the bible you begin to see
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:29] it's all through there
[1:07:33] unbelief hides in human reasoning
[1:07:38] it's reasonable
[1:07:41] common sense says
[1:07:45] if it's so common
[1:07:47] is it truth
[1:07:49] is the truth ever common
[1:07:53] just a question
[1:07:55] if everybody thinks one way is that
[1:07:57] usually the way god thinks
[1:08:00] the whole world thinks this only a few
[1:08:02] of you weirdos think this
[1:08:05] common sense would say
[1:08:10] joshua and caleb didn't have the common
[1:08:12] sense of the day
[1:08:14] they had a sixth sense
[1:08:16] not common sense
[1:08:18] and i want sixth sense to overrule
[1:08:20] common sense
[1:08:24] praise god i like brother branham i'm
[1:08:26] not supporting ignorance
[1:08:28] i'm not saying
[1:08:29] i'm not saying be reckless
[1:08:32] for no reason i'm saying believe the
[1:08:34] word
[1:08:35] follow the pillar of fire stay with
[1:08:37] where god's leading and don't let
[1:08:39] reasoning stop you if god's leading
[1:08:41] don't let reasoning stop
[1:08:43] just be sure of god's leadership and be
[1:08:45] sure that it's leadership on the word
[1:08:47] amen but don't stop just because
[1:08:49] reasoning shows you a good reason to
[1:08:51] stop
[1:08:52] wait till god tells you to stop
[1:08:56] amen so it's not reckless abandonment to
[1:08:58] prove that i'm a real believer and i'm
[1:09:00] going to charge against everything
[1:09:02] that's foolishness
[1:09:03] that's that's not what god asked us to
[1:09:05] do but he asked us just to follow him to
[1:09:08] believe him and if he leads us then
[1:09:10] we're safe you know the safest place to
[1:09:12] be is smack dab in the will of god for
[1:09:14] your life
[1:09:16] and it doesn't matter what reasoning
[1:09:17] says amen the safest place for you as an
[1:09:20] individual to be is smack dab in the
[1:09:23] center of god's will
[1:09:26] and every nobody around you may
[1:09:28] understand why you're there or what
[1:09:29] you're doing and it may not make sense
[1:09:31] to any of them but it doesn't have to
[1:09:33] make sense to any of them it doesn't
[1:09:34] even have to make sense to you all it
[1:09:36] has to allah has to do is trigger from
[1:09:38] the sixth sense that this is what god
[1:09:40] wants me to do and then you hold fast to
[1:09:42] that and you see it in the word let god
[1:09:44] bring it to pass
[1:09:46] but don't move from it just because
[1:09:47] somebody can sit down and reason with
[1:09:49] you
[1:09:51] let the word move us friends
[1:09:54] brother man says in the message look
[1:09:58] it says when he came into the world he
[1:09:59] was the word himself he didn't have to
[1:10:02] write no books he never wrote a book he
[1:10:04] he was the word he didn't have to write
[1:10:07] about anything because he was what the
[1:10:09] others had wrote about
[1:10:11] he was the word
[1:10:14] therefore he didn't write anything with
[1:10:15] his own hand he was the word itself and
[1:10:18] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:20] forever so he still remains the word
[1:10:25] so if we want him
[1:10:27] we must get the word for our day and if
[1:10:29] we get the word for our day we're
[1:10:31] getting him
[1:10:34] so
[1:10:36] there's a war sometimes between
[1:10:38] reasoning and revelation in the word
[1:10:41] so let's take revelation in the word and
[1:10:43] discount reasoning
[1:10:45] so unbelief hides in reasoning which is
[1:10:48] science and logic
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:52] it's not logical to walk on water
[1:10:56] scientifically it's impossible
[1:10:59] it's not logical amen to take a piece of
[1:11:02] bread and break it and expect another
[1:11:04] piece to grow back that's not logical
[1:11:07] that's not reasonable yet it's true
[1:11:12] it's not logical to think that peter can
[1:11:14] go throw a line and a hook in the water
[1:11:16] and the first fish that he pulls out he
[1:11:19] can reach in and pull a coin out of its
[1:11:20] mouth that's enough money to pay for his
[1:11:22] tribute and jesus's tribute
[1:11:26] that's not reasonable friends i've
[1:11:28] fished a lot and i like fishing and i've
[1:11:30] never found a coin in a fish's mouth
[1:11:34] and i've got hundreds of fish and
[1:11:36] reasoning and science and logic would
[1:11:38] tell me that there's no coins in fish's
[1:11:40] mouth because i've tried it and i proved
[1:11:42] it
[1:11:44] i've broke bread i've ate slice after
[1:11:47] slice after slice
[1:11:51] you see reasoning in science and all
[1:11:55] these carnal things amen they can they
[1:11:57] they're there to be an antagonist to
[1:12:00] faith
[1:12:02] to try faith to test faith because for
[1:12:04] the sixth sense has to push through the
[1:12:07] muck and the mire of the pond so that
[1:12:09] the lily can come out and strike the sun
[1:12:11] it's got to go past reasoning past logic
[1:12:13] past science past education past common
[1:12:16] sense and get up here to where it could
[1:12:17] get in the sunlight and then bloom into
[1:12:19] full bloom
[1:12:22] got to be able to push its way out
[1:12:25] another place that unbelief can hide
[1:12:28] is in church
[1:12:30] said religion religion i would say is
[1:12:32] the form of religion i pray my prayers
[1:12:35] every day i listen to so many tapes i
[1:12:38] you know i i do all my religious duties
[1:12:42] amen that's the same thing the pharisees
[1:12:43] did
[1:12:45] and i doubt we've gotten as good as at
[1:12:46] it as they are
[1:12:49] but that form of religion was a place to
[1:12:51] hide unbelief
[1:12:54] unbelief was hiding in the camp of
[1:12:56] israel when they were then when they
[1:12:58] were walking in the word and following a
[1:13:00] pillar of fire and a prophetic ministry
[1:13:03] from bondage
[1:13:04] all the way to the promised land and
[1:13:06] unbelief was walking right in the midst
[1:13:08] of that fulfillment of the word
[1:13:11] wherever god's working satan's working
[1:13:16] unbelievers hiding in reasoning and
[1:13:18] science and logic
[1:13:20] amen because you can make a good case
[1:13:23] for anything
[1:13:26] you can make a good case for anything
[1:13:28] list your facts put it together sit down
[1:13:31] you can sell somebody on anything you
[1:13:33] just get all your facts lined up and
[1:13:34] they can all be true facts
[1:13:37] and reasoning and logic and science and
[1:13:39] you begin to demonstrate and show how
[1:13:41] it's always worked this way and this is
[1:13:43] the way it will always be and you can't
[1:13:45] go beyond these boundaries and blah blah
[1:13:48] blah blah blah and a lot of times all
[1:13:50] that is is a hiding place for unbelief
[1:13:52] what's really under all that is unbelief
[1:13:55] but unbelief is gathering the facts
[1:13:57] unbelief is looking at the science
[1:13:59] unbelief is looking at the logic
[1:14:04] in other places in church
[1:14:06] in the group
[1:14:09] in the group
[1:14:10] unbelief can hide in the group
[1:14:12] and because we know that this group is
[1:14:14] okay i'm okay
[1:14:18] that's dangerous
[1:14:21] the unbelief can hide right in the
[1:14:23] church
[1:14:25] amen it can hide in the group amen when
[1:14:28] when jehoshaphat went up to see ahab and
[1:14:30] they were going to take some of their
[1:14:31] land amen they had 400
[1:14:34] brothers said hebrew prophets
[1:14:37] amen with a gift and manifestation in
[1:14:39] their life 400 of them that all said the
[1:14:42] same thing go up and take it it's in the
[1:14:45] word we have a scripture we also have a
[1:14:47] supernatural element among us that told
[1:14:49] us it's right go take it
[1:14:51] and for some reason jehoshaphat asked
[1:14:53] the question is there not one more and
[1:14:55] they have said there is but i hate him
[1:14:56] and brought mackay up and mekiah said
[1:14:59] something different than the rest of
[1:15:00] them and said because micaiah based off
[1:15:03] faith in a true gift was able to stand
[1:15:05] in opposition to 400 of his peers
[1:15:12] and said how can the 400 be wrong and
[1:15:15] the one be right
[1:15:18] read the bible that's all i got to say
[1:15:20] is read the bible amen it's not the
[1:15:23] group it's not the security in numbers
[1:15:25] amen you have to remember i i want to
[1:15:27] explain this for a minute there's two
[1:15:29] natures to a christian
[1:15:31] i'm two good natures i'm not talking
[1:15:32] about the bad
[1:15:34] there's the sheep nature
[1:15:36] and the eagle nature
[1:15:39] right
[1:15:40] the sheep nature
[1:15:42] it meant is in relationship to is in
[1:15:45] relation to your relationship with jesus
[1:15:47] christ
[1:15:48] and in your relationship to one
[1:15:50] another right just the human side like
[1:15:54] we will never
[1:15:55] not want to get together and have
[1:15:57] fellowship
[1:15:59] that's the sheep nature
[1:16:01] we will never stop wanting to be close
[1:16:03] together
[1:16:04] to fellowship and meet at each other's
[1:16:06] homes talk about the word and congregate
[1:16:08] together we're never going to stop
[1:16:10] wanting to do that that's the sheep
[1:16:11] nature and the sheep nature is what
[1:16:13] makes us timid
[1:16:14] incapable
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] totally dependent on the shepherd
[1:16:20] all right
[1:16:22] so in in relation to our natural life
[1:16:25] our natural part of our christianity
[1:16:27] we're sheep
[1:16:30] but down in the soul
[1:16:32] there's an eagle
[1:16:35] and the eagle can fly solo
[1:16:38] all by itself
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] the eagle can get its own fresh meat
[1:16:48] right
[1:16:49] when it can't go to church the eagle
[1:16:51] still eats
[1:16:53] if the church is closed the eagle still
[1:16:55] eats because the eagle can find its own
[1:16:57] fresh kill of the word
[1:17:00] it can fly high it can see it can hunt
[1:17:03] amen and you know what you can't help an
[1:17:06] eagle fly
[1:17:09] flying's not one of those things you can
[1:17:10] do in tandem it's not one of those
[1:17:11] things you can do with training wheels
[1:17:14] it's not really one of those things you
[1:17:16] work your way up to i mean you're not
[1:17:18] flying and now you're flying i mean
[1:17:19] there was no crawling and toddling and
[1:17:22] holding the hand and eventually walking
[1:17:24] that's not how flying works friends the
[1:17:26] way flying works is is you know you got
[1:17:28] wings and you find out they're there and
[1:17:30] you start to flap them and say what does
[1:17:32] this do but there comes a day that you
[1:17:34] jump
[1:17:36] and then you fly before that you weren't
[1:17:37] flying and now you're flying and nobody
[1:17:39] could hold your hand when you did it
[1:17:42] so there's two aspects to this christian
[1:17:45] wall there's a natural side of us amen
[1:17:47] that wants fellowship and should want
[1:17:49] fellowship that's dependent and needy
[1:17:51] and totally incapable of doing anything
[1:17:52] for themselves
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:55] but there's an attribute of god on the
[1:17:57] inside that's a little eaglet just like
[1:17:59] the father
[1:18:02] amen that can fly high and see it far
[1:18:05] off that can catch revelation
[1:18:07] independent of the group
[1:18:10] that can feed on the fresh kill
[1:18:13] independent of the group
[1:18:15] that can find its own rabbits
[1:18:19] you realize
[1:18:20] that's the ego nature
[1:18:22] and god is going to prove both
[1:18:25] he's proved the sheep side
[1:18:27] but he's proving the eagle side here
[1:18:29] lately and more and more i believe he'll
[1:18:31] be proving that these are his eaglets
[1:18:34] if you separate them put them all by
[1:18:35] themselves you put john on the isle of
[1:18:37] patmos he was an eagle
[1:18:40] amen you separate them and disband them
[1:18:42] and you send them from the fellowship in
[1:18:44] jerusalem they went out eagles
[1:18:46] were they sheep yes but they're eagles
[1:18:48] too amen praise be to god
[1:18:51] so that's why sometimes church
[1:18:55] is a place to hide
[1:18:58] because sometimes a goat can look like a
[1:18:59] sheep
[1:19:01] and act like a sheep and mix with the
[1:19:03] sheep
[1:19:04] but in the goat is no eagle
[1:19:08] so sometimes a place for unbelief to
[1:19:10] hide
[1:19:11] is right in the group walk
[1:19:14] right in the church
[1:19:17] see god
[1:19:19] he wants to have
[1:19:20] preeminence and he'll do whatever he
[1:19:22] wants to get that preeminence
[1:19:26] look at john let's go back to the gospel
[1:19:29] of john and look at john chapter 5.
[1:19:40] john chapter 5
[1:19:42] and verse 45.
[1:19:50] jesus says do not think that i will
[1:19:52] accuse you to the father there is one
[1:19:54] that accuses you even moses in whom you
[1:19:57] trust
[1:19:59] for had you believed moses you would
[1:20:01] have believed me
[1:20:02] for he wrote of me
[1:20:04] but if you believe not his writings how
[1:20:07] shall you believe my words
[1:20:09] my what a stinging accusation he made
[1:20:12] and he says i'm not accusing you
[1:20:14] he said i'm not going to accuse you i'm
[1:20:15] not going to say anything that book
[1:20:17] you're holding under your arm is going
[1:20:18] to accuse you
[1:20:20] that scroll that you've been toning
[1:20:21] around and quoting out of that's the
[1:20:23] thing that's going to be accuse you
[1:20:25] because if you don't believe what he
[1:20:26] wrote there how can you believe in me
[1:20:28] because i am what he wrote there
[1:20:33] can we say that about ourselves i am
[1:20:36] what he's written here
[1:20:38] he said he'll have a bride without spot
[1:20:40] or wrinkle this is right here he's going
[1:20:41] to have a bride without spotter wrinkle
[1:20:43] he's got work to do friends but he's
[1:20:44] doing it by the washing of the water of
[1:20:46] his word
[1:20:48] there's a manifestation of the word on
[1:20:50] earth today and it is present tense
[1:20:52] truth
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:55] brother man says in the message there is
[1:20:57] a man here that can turn on the light
[1:20:59] and to you man that's listening to this
[1:21:01] across the world wherever you may be
[1:21:03] there is something wrong with your
[1:21:04] experience when you say that you love
[1:21:06] god and refuse his word
[1:21:08] there's something you refuse to no
[1:21:10] wonder that things can't the church is
[1:21:12] in its condition and the things can't
[1:21:14] cannot be done as god promised is
[1:21:16] because you won't even receive the word
[1:21:17] or walk in the light the bible said let
[1:21:19] us walk in the light as he is in the
[1:21:21] light then the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:23] god's son cleanses us from all sin sin
[1:21:26] is unbelief how do i get cleansed from
[1:21:28] unbelief by walking in the light
[1:21:32] let's go to that in first john first
[1:21:34] john 1.
[1:21:45] first john 1 5.
[1:21:55] first john chapter 1 verse 5.
[1:22:00] this then is the message we have heard
[1:22:02] of him and declare unto you that god is
[1:22:04] light and in him has no darkness at all
[1:22:07] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:22:08] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:22:10] not the truth
[1:22:12] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:22:14] the light we have fellowship one with
[1:22:16] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:18] his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:22:24] we've said this many times you all know
[1:22:25] this but i i'm going to stir up your
[1:22:27] memory
[1:22:30] it didn't say if you walk in the light
[1:22:32] as he was in the light
[1:22:37] not where light once shown
[1:22:40] but where light is presently shining
[1:22:44] where light is presently shining you
[1:22:47] must walk in that light and if we walk
[1:22:50] in that light as he is presently the
[1:22:53] gospel the good news today shining that
[1:22:56] light then we have fellowship with one
[1:22:58] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:00] cleanses us from all sin all unbelief
[1:23:03] all attributes of unbelief
[1:23:05] brother remember the feast of trumpets
[1:23:07] he said how will the messiah the people
[1:23:10] that's believing him now
[1:23:12] know it unless they're constantly in the
[1:23:14] word to know what he is daniel said the
[1:23:17] wise shall know but the foolish the
[1:23:19] unwise wouldn't know they shouldn't know
[1:23:20] their god now now he shall appear in the
[1:23:23] last days is to bring the people back
[1:23:26] to the word
[1:23:28] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:23:30] know her mate the revealed word that's
[1:23:33] why this has to happen
[1:23:35] oh just get the imagery
[1:23:38] we all know this this is nothing new but
[1:23:40] i just love it that she will know her
[1:23:43] husband
[1:23:44] her mate the revealed
[1:23:46] word so if you want to meet your husband
[1:23:50] and meet your mate you have to meet him
[1:23:52] as the revealed word
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:56] right we're not we're not looking to
[1:23:59] embrace a physical body of flesh yet
[1:24:01] that'll come next
[1:24:03] but now we're embracing the body word of
[1:24:05] the son of man we're embracing the
[1:24:08] revealed word amen that is our husband
[1:24:10] that is our mate that is our counterpart
[1:24:13] we are the revealed word he is the
[1:24:16] revealed word and two revealed words are
[1:24:18] coming together
[1:24:20] we're embracing him word coming to word
[1:24:23] word embracing word light and light
[1:24:26] coming together life and life coming
[1:24:28] together
[1:24:29] so we're going to embrace him we're
[1:24:30] going to embrace him as the revealed
[1:24:32] word
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:38] it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in
[1:24:40] luther wesley and the pentecostals and
[1:24:41] them scripture says it wasn't
[1:24:43] but it will come
[1:24:45] that is his promise for this age we're
[1:24:47] living in the age that his coming will
[1:24:49] be in
[1:24:50] she must be identified in him
[1:24:53] any woman must be identified with her
[1:24:55] husband for the two or one and christ's
[1:24:57] bride has to be identified with him for
[1:24:59] the two or one and he is the word not
[1:25:02] the denomination
[1:25:04] get what he's saying now be real careful
[1:25:06] here
[1:25:07] he's saying she has to be identified
[1:25:10] with her husband for the two or one
[1:25:13] so whatever he is she has to be she has
[1:25:15] to be identified with him
[1:25:18] standing alongside him identified with
[1:25:21] him his identity is her identity
[1:25:24] right and so he says
[1:25:26] now and christ's bride has to be
[1:25:28] identified with him for the two are one
[1:25:33] and he is the word
[1:25:35] not the denomination
[1:25:38] he's showing people are embracing the
[1:25:41] denomination
[1:25:44] which is another husband
[1:25:46] he's not talking about a physical body
[1:25:49] he's talking about the word they're
[1:25:50] embracing their denomination in their
[1:25:52] denominational teaching that's not him
[1:25:55] we have to be identified with him what
[1:25:57] is him it's the word it's the word made
[1:25:59] light it's the word manifest in this day
[1:26:02] and we have to be identified with him
[1:26:05] which is not the denomination we can't
[1:26:07] be identified with the denomination
[1:26:09] wrong husband but we have to be
[1:26:10] identified with him our mate our husband
[1:26:13] which is the revealed word
[1:26:17] is it not the denomination the word we
[1:26:19] are to be children of the light and the
[1:26:21] light is the word which has made light
[1:26:23] for this age
[1:26:24] if you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:26:26] light then we have fellowship one
[1:26:27] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:29] will cleanse us from all sin
[1:26:31] what's the light
[1:26:33] the light is the word which has made
[1:26:34] light for this age
[1:26:37] how do we know light except it comes
[1:26:39] from the word all right the word
[1:26:41] made flesh
[1:26:46] the word
[1:26:47] made flesh not the denomination
[1:26:50] where's the word reflection she must be
[1:26:52] identified in him she must be identified
[1:26:54] with him where is the word made flesh
[1:26:56] friends
[1:26:57] where and all the earth is the word made
[1:26:59] flesh you point me to it where in all of
[1:27:02] the world today is the word made flesh
[1:27:05] it's in his bride
[1:27:08] the word made flesh is the light of the
[1:27:10] age when you see it and the bible said
[1:27:13] so
[1:27:14] if you walk in the light and see that's
[1:27:16] not being close to a bride member that's
[1:27:18] not being in a bright church amen it's
[1:27:20] none of those it's not by association
[1:27:21] but it's about you being born again in
[1:27:24] him amen and he in you amen it's the
[1:27:27] revealed word for the hour and the
[1:27:29] revealed word for the hour is christ in
[1:27:31] the formation of the bride
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] and we can only get into that through
[1:27:36] new birth amen by revelation amen by the
[1:27:39] baptism of the holy ghost for that is
[1:27:41] the light for this day and if we walk in
[1:27:43] the light as he is in the light then we
[1:27:45] have fellowship one with another and the
[1:27:47] blood of jesus christ
[1:27:48] will cleanse us from all sin
[1:27:50] where are we going to walk in the
[1:27:52] revealed word
[1:27:55] i just in the back just before i come
[1:27:57] out something just hit me
[1:27:59] and it was exciting
[1:28:01] and i just want to show
[1:28:03] right here where we're at
[1:28:06] titles of brother branham sermons i'm
[1:28:08] going to read some titles
[1:28:11] and i want to ask you where your
[1:28:12] husband's at i want to ask you where
[1:28:15] christ is
[1:28:18] it is i be not afraid
[1:28:21] what's he preaching about
[1:28:23] who is the eye brother branham
[1:28:28] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:28:29] light
[1:28:33] is there
[1:28:35] that's the question is there
[1:28:36] is there a man here is the son of man
[1:28:38] here
[1:28:40] it wasn't brother branham the son of man
[1:28:42] was using brother branham amen to turn
[1:28:44] on that lie but the brother branham's
[1:28:46] off the scene son of man still here i'm
[1:28:48] asking you the question is there a man
[1:28:50] here
[1:28:51] that can turn on the light
[1:28:53] who is that man
[1:28:55] that is your mate your husband the one
[1:28:57] you're to be identified the one you're
[1:28:58] supposed to be embracing and if you walk
[1:29:00] in that light as he is in that light
[1:29:02] hallelujah then there's a washing amen
[1:29:05] then there's a separating from unbelief
[1:29:09] without that we're rejecting god
[1:29:12] to reject that is to reject god
[1:29:15] the question is is there a man here who
[1:29:17] can turn on the light oh yeah who is he
[1:29:18] my husband
[1:29:20] my mate
[1:29:21] the revealed word he's here to turn on
[1:29:23] the light
[1:29:26] who do you say this is
[1:29:30] what a question amen who do you say that
[1:29:32] is is it the man on the platform
[1:29:35] or is it the pillar of fire the angel of
[1:29:36] the lord christ himself descended to
[1:29:39] open the seals
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:41] who do you say this is
[1:29:43] oh well you know it's you know it's not
[1:29:46] christ yet but it's kind of like i mean
[1:29:48] in a way
[1:29:50] you got the wrong person
[1:29:52] who do you say this is brother man's
[1:29:54] asking a question who do you say this is
[1:29:56] what reasoning will say well you know
[1:29:58] because of this timing of sequence and
[1:30:00] it doesn't come yet and then
[1:30:03] that's not the question don't give me
[1:30:05] your reasoning what does your heart say
[1:30:06] who do you say this is
[1:30:10] if it's not jesus christ i don't want
[1:30:11] anything to do with it if it's not him i
[1:30:14] don't want it if it's like him part him
[1:30:16] i don't want i want him wherever he is
[1:30:19] that's where i want to be
[1:30:24] look away to jesus
[1:30:27] where do you look
[1:30:30] where's brother branham pointing and
[1:30:31] look away to jesus
[1:30:33] where's he pointing them to he's
[1:30:35] pointing them to the word look away to
[1:30:37] jesus the revealed word he starts
[1:30:39] describing the events that are taking
[1:30:40] place the manifestation of the word in
[1:30:42] that day look away to jesus where do i
[1:30:44] look to him he's right here
[1:30:50] the identified christ of all ages
[1:30:55] where is he being identified
[1:30:58] amongst his people
[1:31:02] mighty god unveiled before us
[1:31:08] he didn't say the mighty god which will
[1:31:10] be unveiled before us when we get there
[1:31:13] the mighty god which will be unveiled
[1:31:14] for us later
[1:31:16] he said the mighty god unveiled before
[1:31:19] us
[1:31:20] present tense
[1:31:22] truth
[1:31:24] see brother branham knew what he was
[1:31:26] talking about
[1:31:27] he knew what he meant by what he said
[1:31:30] and if you just read i had the best time
[1:31:31] in the back i took 10 minutes i could
[1:31:33] probably find a lot more but like who is
[1:31:36] this melchizedek
[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:40] logically you would say who was that if
[1:31:42] he's answering the question of who
[1:31:43] melchizedek was in the bible brother
[1:31:45] brennan would title that who was that
[1:31:47] melchizedek
[1:31:48] that's how everybody else refers to it
[1:31:50] but brother bannon realizes that the
[1:31:52] white wig one has come down that the
[1:31:54] high priest has descended and he's come
[1:31:57] with an open book in his hand and so now
[1:31:59] he asks the question the correct way
[1:32:01] amen he's not that he's unschooled in
[1:32:03] grammar it's not that he made a mistake
[1:32:05] he asked the question exactly the right
[1:32:07] way who is this melchizedek
[1:32:13] which melchizedek the one that's present
[1:32:15] which one's the present the same man
[1:32:17] that can turn on the light the same
[1:32:19] identified christ of all ages the same
[1:32:21] one you're supposed to be looking away
[1:32:22] to amen the same one that says i'm here
[1:32:24] be not afraid
[1:32:27] hallelujah friend
[1:32:29] i don't know about you but i'm happy i'm
[1:32:31] happy to be alive i'm happy whatever
[1:32:34] trouble has to come just don't take this
[1:32:36] away from me
[1:32:37] don't take this message don't take this
[1:32:39] revealed word away from me don't pluck
[1:32:41] this out of my heart this is my promised
[1:32:43] land and i'm walking in it and i don't
[1:32:45] care how many giants are there all it's
[1:32:46] proving is it's a good land a real good
[1:32:49] land if they got enough material out of
[1:32:51] that land to build a walled city that
[1:32:52] you can march a chariot around then that
[1:32:54] means this is a good land
[1:32:58] amen
[1:32:59] they've got resources coming out their
[1:33:01] ears they've got abilities that i've
[1:33:03] never seen before this is a good land
[1:33:05] i'm not afraid of this land they're bred
[1:33:07] for us friends every demon that's
[1:33:09] sitting on the word he's got to get out
[1:33:10] of the way
[1:33:12] because this is my land
[1:33:16] amen praise be to god
[1:33:20] who do you say this is
[1:33:23] that's the question of the night
[1:33:25] who do you say this is
[1:33:28] is it kind of like jesus may be in a way
[1:33:31] and
[1:33:32] or is it
[1:33:34] him as he come in the invisible union
[1:33:37] tonight unite with you
[1:33:40] don't worry about what you see
[1:33:43] don't use reasoning and logic and
[1:33:45] physical i see this and that
[1:33:48] brother bam said we don't look for nail
[1:33:50] prints
[1:33:52] we look for the word made manifest
[1:33:54] to find our mate to find our husband
[1:33:57] don't let that logical reasoning tie us
[1:34:00] down
[1:34:00] that carnal i have to see this and it's
[1:34:03] physically here it's physically there
[1:34:06] that's materialistic friends that's
[1:34:07] carnal understanding
[1:34:09] but something in our heart says he's
[1:34:11] here
[1:34:13] i'm embracing him i'm uniting with him
[1:34:15] the real living breathing jesus christ
[1:34:17] that has shown me he's the mighty god
[1:34:20] unveiled the identified christ of all
[1:34:22] ages the man who can turn on the light
[1:34:24] he's here
[1:34:26] i can feel him i know i'm embracing him
[1:34:29] he's embracing me he's whispering love
[1:34:30] secrets in my ear it's him amen it's not
[1:34:33] a creed it's not a dogma it's not a set
[1:34:35] of teachings it's him
[1:34:38] and if it's not that
[1:34:41] i'm finished
[1:34:42] count me out
[1:34:44] i wasn't looking for another
[1:34:45] denomination i wasn't looking for
[1:34:47] another group of people to associate
[1:34:48] myself with amen if it's not that check
[1:34:51] me out
[1:34:53] i'll tell you something else if i can't
[1:34:55] have the faith of caleb amen if i can't
[1:34:57] have the case of faith of caleb i said
[1:34:59] god take me off this earth today
[1:35:02] because i don't want to live another day
[1:35:04] in unbelief i don't want to have another
[1:35:06] day gazing over to a promised land not
[1:35:08] believing that i can have it in my life
[1:35:12] i want the faith of caleb god or take me
[1:35:14] off and if this message isn't the same
[1:35:17] today as it was when brother branham
[1:35:18] preached it get me out of here i check
[1:35:20] out i'm done if it doesn't have the same
[1:35:22] power to deliver me it doesn't have the
[1:35:24] same power to bring me out if it doesn't
[1:35:26] have the same power to reveal christ to
[1:35:28] me count me out
[1:35:31] amen i don't want to i don't want to
[1:35:33] have a faith and the man that was
[1:35:34] standing there it wasn't him the same
[1:35:37] one that was standing next to him is
[1:35:38] standing here today
[1:35:41] if it's some kind of different or
[1:35:43] inferior faith or an inferior word i
[1:35:46] mean check me out send me somewhere else
[1:35:48] i don't want none of it
[1:35:50] but it's got to be the same power the
[1:35:52] same manifestation the same word with
[1:35:55] the same power to back it up or i don't
[1:35:57] want any of it
[1:36:01] praise be to god
[1:36:03] don't want to act like an unbeliever in
[1:36:05] the face of trouble i want to be a
[1:36:06] believer

[1:36:26] and they were really sick
[1:36:28] really bad off
[1:36:30] well what's changed in the word

[1:36:35] what part of the message is different
[1:36:38] what power of god is still not made
[1:36:39] manifest
[1:36:42] nothing's changed
[1:36:44] i believe the same way i believed before
[1:36:47] i believe the same things i believed
[1:36:49] before
[1:36:50] god allows things to teach us lessons
[1:36:52] god allows things to display himself god
[1:36:54] does what he wants to do he's still god
[1:36:56] and i still believe him the same way i
[1:36:58] believed him before it all started

[1:37:18] don't want to die along the way so that
[1:37:21] somebody can bury me put on my tombstone
[1:37:23] he was a great pastor he believed the
[1:37:25] message no i want him to know that i
[1:37:27] believe the message
[1:37:30] not because i died in a time of peace
[1:37:32] with no challenge to faith but if
[1:37:33] there's going to come a challenge to
[1:37:34] faith i say god i believe helped out my
[1:37:37] unbelief

[1:37:49] out amen i need more of the carnal
[1:37:51] unbelief of the world washed away from
[1:37:53] my mind and moved away from my psyche so
[1:37:56] that what's there can come to the
[1:37:57] surface in a greater way
[1:38:00] we believe the word because he he called
[1:38:02] us to be believers in this day
[1:38:04] he called us to manifest his word he
[1:38:07] called us to stand upon his word
[1:38:09] and ask what i want to do with
[1:38:11] everything that's in me
[1:38:14] i
[1:38:16] if you find me dead
[1:38:19] with a sword in my hand
[1:38:22] rest assure
[1:38:23] that whatever killed me got stabbed at
[1:38:25] least once
[1:38:30] rest assured i went down swinging
[1:38:34] amen
[1:38:35] you can rest your you can rest suddenly
[1:38:37] on the fact if you say oh what happened
[1:38:39] to chad it was so sad hey man he got
[1:38:41] this and that happened and this you can
[1:38:43] rest assured there'll be blood on my
[1:38:45] sword
[1:38:47] because i want to die a believer if i if
[1:38:49] i give if it's his predestinated plan
[1:38:52] for me not to go in the translation then
[1:38:54] i want to die believing his word
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:58] i don't want to take the safe route i
[1:39:00] don't want a captain to go back to egypt
[1:39:01] i don't want to always keep my hands
[1:39:03] clean and keep my reputation pretty
[1:39:06] great
[1:39:09] but i want to be a believer
[1:39:12] and believe this word
[1:39:14] all of my days
[1:39:18] let's go to john chapter 3.
[1:39:20] musicians you can come
[1:39:22] the gospel of john chapter 3. we've got
[1:39:24] a lot more but we're going to hold it
[1:39:26] off for sunday i just feel to stop here
[1:39:39] john chapter 3
[1:39:44] verse 16.
[1:39:48] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:39:49] his only begotten son
[1:39:51] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:39:53] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:39:56] remember now walk in the light as he's
[1:39:58] in the light so what does it mean to
[1:40:00] believe in him
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:04] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:40:06] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:40:08] through him might be saved
[1:40:10] he that believeth on him is not
[1:40:12] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:40:14] condemned already because he has not
[1:40:16] believed in the name of the only
[1:40:18] begotten son of god
[1:40:21] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:40:23] has come into the world
[1:40:24] and men loved darkness rather than light
[1:40:27] because their deeds
[1:40:29] were evil
[1:40:32] why will somebody stay in the darkness
[1:40:34] of denomination
[1:40:36] this is what the scripture says
[1:40:39] when they see the light
[1:40:42] when they see the truth when they see
[1:40:44] the gospel the good news today
[1:40:47] but they'll stay in a denominational
[1:40:50] darkness
[1:40:52] you have to ask yourself why
[1:40:55] why
[1:40:57] didn't those 10 spies want to take the
[1:40:59] land
[1:41:03] good question
[1:41:04] why did joshua and caleb want to take
[1:41:06] the land but why did the ten spies
[1:41:09] refuse the promise refuse the word
[1:41:12] refuse the whole purpose of their
[1:41:13] journey
[1:41:15] the red sea parted so that they could
[1:41:16] take the land
[1:41:18] i mean the cloud came down the manner
[1:41:21] fell the water came out of the rock so
[1:41:23] that they could take the land everything
[1:41:24] that had been done was leading up to
[1:41:26] them taking the land and now they're
[1:41:27] going to throw it all away why did they
[1:41:29] not want to take the land
[1:41:33] scripture i think tells us
[1:41:36] in numbers chapter 14
[1:41:38] caleb and joshua they steal the people
[1:41:40] and they says
[1:41:41] listen
[1:41:42] if the lord delight in us
[1:41:47] if the lord that's the question
[1:41:51] are you confident
[1:41:53] in his love
[1:41:55] for you
[1:41:57] that's the real question the real
[1:41:59] question is who are you
[1:42:02] caleb and joshua was no big deal they
[1:42:05] said they're bread for us
[1:42:06] if if the if the lord delight not he'll
[1:42:09] deliver in the more hand they'll be bred
[1:42:11] for
[1:42:13] joshua us
[1:42:13] caleb what did they see they saw
[1:42:16] themselves as loved
[1:42:19] of god
[1:42:20] they saw themselves as recipients of the
[1:42:23] promise they saw themselves that promise
[1:42:27] was them
[1:42:29] that promise it was a personal promise
[1:42:31] to joshua and caleb to the rest of them
[1:42:34] it was just a promise
[1:42:37] you see the difference
[1:42:38] yeah it's the promised word
[1:42:40] but joshua and caleb it was the promised
[1:42:42] word to them
[1:42:46] and they had confidence in god's love
[1:42:48] for them and god's election and god's
[1:42:50] choosing and god's providence to bring
[1:42:52] them all the way there had only secured
[1:42:55] the fact that they knew god loved them
[1:42:57] and if god delighted us there's nothing
[1:43:00] going to harm us
[1:43:02] and so the the question the statement by
[1:43:05] caleb amen proves what is in the heart
[1:43:08] of the ten the ten didn't know
[1:43:12] whether god loved them or not
[1:43:14] they didn't really know who they were
[1:43:16] they weren't secure in their
[1:43:18] relationship and their position with
[1:43:20] jehovah
[1:43:22] they had fallen they knew moses was good
[1:43:25] they had fallen most they knew that was
[1:43:27] a good connection and they had enough
[1:43:28] faith to follow that although they
[1:43:30] questioned it a lot
[1:43:32] but they could see things that proved
[1:43:34] that you know moses was in tight with
[1:43:36] god but when the showdown came when it
[1:43:40] was them with a sword in their hand
[1:43:42] when it was them with their wives and
[1:43:44] their little ones having to stand on the
[1:43:46] word they didn't know if god would show
[1:43:49] up on their behalf or not
[1:43:51] they didn't know if god really loved now
[1:43:53] they couldn't doubt that god could do it
[1:43:55] because they saw him stand the water up
[1:43:57] they saw him feeding man from heaven
[1:43:59] every every single night they saw him
[1:44:01] bring quails amen they saw him do all
[1:44:03] the things they could not doubt god's
[1:44:06] ability to deliver them but they doubted
[1:44:08] god's love for them
[1:44:11] and that's the reason they refused the
[1:44:12] word and refused the promise and wanted
[1:44:15] a captain to take him back to egypt and
[1:44:16] wish they had died because when it came
[1:44:18] down to the showdown the question was
[1:44:20] not with god the question was with them
[1:44:23] they didn't know if they really were the
[1:44:25] children of god
[1:44:28] i'm telling you we're all going to face
[1:44:29] the same thing
[1:44:31] we are everyone going to face the exact
[1:44:33] same thing and the question is is he my
[1:44:35] father or is he just father to people
[1:44:37] around me
[1:44:39] is he a father to the bride and the
[1:44:41] believer or is he
[1:44:42] my personal father who looks after me
[1:44:46] and will keep his word and promise to me
[1:44:49] that he will deliver me that he promised
[1:44:51] to me that by his stripes i am healed is
[1:44:54] he my father and are the promises mine
[1:44:57] or am i part of the religious church
[1:45:00] movement and says yes we are part of the
[1:45:03] promise yes he is our father there's
[1:45:06] coming a day that's not going to work
[1:45:08] anymore
[1:45:10] we felt really secure saying he's our
[1:45:12] father
[1:45:13] he's our deliverer he keeps the word
[1:45:15] he'll deliver his bride he'll raise his
[1:45:17] bride up he'll translate his bride and
[1:45:19] you can get everybody in a room to shout
[1:45:21] amen when you say that but now the
[1:45:23] question is is he going to raise his
[1:45:25] bride the question is does he delight in
[1:45:27] you
[1:45:29] does he delight in you did he make the
[1:45:31] promise to you is the promise for the
[1:45:33] translation yours or is the promise for
[1:45:35] the translation general to the bride
[1:45:39] we've tried to be bribed by association
[1:45:42] and you can only be bribed by
[1:45:43] relationship
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:45] not by association but by personal
[1:45:47] relationship he has been revealed
[1:45:49] personally to you there's been a
[1:45:51] quickening of the seed in your soul when
[1:45:53] christ himself has come to spark off and
[1:45:56] quicken that seed in the soul and
[1:45:57] there's been a invisible union between
[1:45:59] you and christ and then you have to be
[1:46:02] confident he delights in you
[1:46:05] it's not good enough he delights in the
[1:46:07] ministers and he delights and my mom and
[1:46:09] dad and i can see oh they've got
[1:46:11] miracles there and this brother has this
[1:46:13] and all around my church there's
[1:46:15] testimonies friends there's coming a day
[1:46:17] that won't hold water that won't mean
[1:46:19] anything for you
[1:46:24] the question is
[1:46:25] does he delight in you
[1:46:28] that's the question to be answered right
[1:46:30] now friends
[1:46:31] that's the question does he delight in
[1:46:33] me
[1:46:34] when i'm all by myself when there's not
[1:46:37] a spouse or a child around when there's
[1:46:39] not a minister or the congregation when
[1:46:41] i'm all alone
[1:46:43] does he delight in me
[1:46:46] and if you can answer yes to that
[1:46:48] question then there's nothing
[1:46:51] going to hurt you
[1:46:53] then there's nothing to worry about
[1:46:55] there's nothing to be afraid of
[1:46:58] because he's got it all in control
[1:47:01] my father
[1:47:03] he's my father
[1:47:05] you realize friends he's my
[1:47:08] father
[1:47:10] i'm not even saying our father
[1:47:14] he's my father
[1:47:17] and my father won't let anything happen
[1:47:20] to me that's not part of his purpose and
[1:47:22] plan
[1:47:24] and if my father in his wisdom saw fit
[1:47:27] to let this trial come then my love to
[1:47:30] him is to say thank you jesus
[1:47:34] i love you anyhow
[1:47:36] and i worship you anyways
[1:47:40] if the lord delight in us
[1:47:43] we can take the land
[1:47:44] if the lord delight in us
[1:47:46] everything's but bread for us
[1:47:48] if the lord delight in us their defenses
[1:47:50] is melted away if the lord delight in us
[1:47:55] you know what the response was
[1:47:58] take up stones
[1:47:59] to stone them
[1:48:03] why they did not want to be exposed as
[1:48:06] unbelievers
[1:48:08] and when somebody else believed the word
[1:48:12] it showed them off as unbelievers
[1:48:15] and they wanted to take up stones and
[1:48:16] stone
[1:48:18] you know what they should have said
[1:48:20] i believe
[1:48:22] god helped down my unbelief
[1:48:25] they should have said you're right
[1:48:28] joshua caleb you're right i got caught
[1:48:31] up in the carnal thinking i got caught
[1:48:33] up in fear i got caught up in all the
[1:48:35] news i got caught up in all this you're
[1:48:37] right
[1:48:39] pray with me brother
[1:48:41] we all get caught up in news
[1:48:44] we all get pushed into the corner we all
[1:48:46] let down on the promise
[1:48:48] is there anybody here who's never let
[1:48:49] down on the promise
[1:48:51] please stand
[1:48:52] i want to meet with you afterwards
[1:48:57] is there anybody who's not failed by
[1:48:59] reasoning not failed by fear
[1:49:04] we all have
[1:49:06] but we're coming to a place
[1:49:08] where faith is going to be the victory
[1:49:10] and god's training us by the ups and the
[1:49:13] downs and the good and the bad and the
[1:49:15] successes and the failures and he's
[1:49:17] teaching us to stay with the word stay
[1:49:19] with the word stay with the word stay
[1:49:21] with the word and realize
[1:49:24] that my father
[1:49:26] has become my husband
[1:49:31] and i'm in a deep dark trial
[1:49:34] but the relationship i have with him i
[1:49:36] realize
[1:49:37] that there's a man here
[1:49:39] that can turn on the light
[1:49:44] not in the church building
[1:49:46] not in the pew next to me but there's a
[1:49:48] man here
[1:49:51] who can turn on the light
[1:49:54] and if there's a man here who can turn
[1:49:56] on the light
[1:49:58] then don't worry about the deep dark
[1:49:59] trial
[1:50:00] he's got it all under control
