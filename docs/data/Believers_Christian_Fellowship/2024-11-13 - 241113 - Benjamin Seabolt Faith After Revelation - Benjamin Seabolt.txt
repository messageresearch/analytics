Thanksgiving in our heart Lord that we can have this privilege of gathering around you the revealed word with the revelation of knowing how how you have appeared in our age in our day Lord may we never take that for granted and father as we would come to this Junction of the service Lord we would just present ourselves to you with humility father knowing that there is no capability no worthiness to feed your sheep Lord father I stand here as a mortal t ask with something that no mortal Can Do Lord so we would just ask that you would come here this evening that you would do what your word said that you would do father and that by the foolishness of preaching that Souls would be saved and that your kingdom would be established so father this is your method this is your way and we Just Surrender ourselves to that both speaker and hearer we would ask that you would just come have the preeminence here this evening and accomplish what you've set this service for to accomplish Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bible we'll turn to Mark the 11th chapter Mark the 11th chapter I'd like to speak this evening on a title of Faith after Revelation Faith after Revelation and I know some of you immediately have the thought that faith is revelation and I know that but we're going to talk about faith after Revelation and I don't intend to present anything Earth shattering to you this is not something that we haven't heard before but I think it's a principle that maybe we can strike from a little bit of a different angle and maybe just encourage somebody this evening um but with that being said I've got some notes here but I don't feel to teach this evening I just feel to be here um well actually I don't feel to be here but I'm here so here I am uh but I just feel relax this evening and just let the Lord do what he wants to so if you have something specific that that you need an answer for or that you're dealing with this is an opportunity because I'm I'm not feeling pressed to stick to my notes I'm not feeling pressed to be here to midnight either but I just say that to let the spirit have Liberty here don't be afraid to to pull and pull me sideways if you need to but here in Mark the 11th chapter we're going to read this very familiar portion of scripture beginning with verse 23 uh let's begin with verse 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou REM removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen therefore I say unto you whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them let's turn to Deuteronomy um 17 and six Deuteronomy 17 and 6 reads as such at the mouth of two witnesses or three Witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death God bless you as you would have your seats this evening this is uh inspiration that actually I've sat on for several months now um but when I first was looking and studying on the pride series that I did that was closely tied to brother random when he had the incident with the spoken word coming into existence and him manifesting that through speaking the squirrels into existence and there was a portion of that situation that really jumped out to me and really struck me but I was you know really in a certain Channel there and I didn't want to deviate off of that didn't feel to but I want to go back and grab that now uh because I think it's very noteworthy it was to me and it's kind kind of altered my thinking um let's read Revelation 12 before we jump into this Revelation 12: 10 this ties directly to the scripture that we just read in deuteron me um 17 as you'll see later it says and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night so we're going to look here in the message speak to this mountain and we all are very familiar with this story but I just want to dig down in some of the details of this because I feel sometimes that we read it a couple times and then we just pass over it and we refer to it as the you know the time the prophet spoke squirrels into existence and we kind of make it a story rather than a situation rather than an event and I believe we can maybe missed some of the importance of what all was going on here during this event but brother brandom is speaking and he says and that scripture came to me again he says whatsoever you say believe that what you say shall come to pass and you can have what you say well I thought and I'm paraphrasing a lot of this for time's sake uh just so you know and he says well I thought why does that scripture keep coming to me when I can't preach on on it because I don't know nothing about it and he says do you think it was the prophets talking well I thought that's right if the person through the atonement Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live in a sphere with God so close that he can be so wrapped up completely in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking these things so brother brandom is struggling with the scripture he says I wouldn't touch it I wouldn't preach on it I wouldn't present it to a congregation because I don't understand it I don't know if it's prec Covenant post Covenant before the cross after the cross I can't tie it into the scripture of how this specifically applies I don't know what to do with it and he's reasoning this over in his mind of how he would explain it and God's dealing with him on this subject and he says and no more than I said that so he the spirit's revealing this to him and brother brandom's confirming it um that yes you know if if that was God anointing the person it would be the same way as the prophet speaking and it wouldn't be the person speaking anymore if through the blood of Jesus Christ they're Sanctified and God has laying this on their heart to speak it wouldn't be the person anymore it would be the same as Christ speaking through Moses or Christ speaking through Abraham or Christ speaking through any of the prophets and he said as soon as I agreed to that no more than I'd said that till the anointing of the Holy Spirit struck me like I have never had it before in all of my life God knows that I raised up to my feet I got scared and something said to me now this is the beginning of your new ministry now ask what you will and it shall be given you and I stood there I don't want to be a fanatic God knows I want to be sane and just and honest and faithful and true right this is a man who has learned a few lessons in life because I'm telling you here and now I would have failed that test the minute that I thought I had a whisper of inspiration to speak and ask for anything that I wanted I'm going to give it a try but he backs up and he says just a minute I do not want to be led into fanaticism who is this speaking to me what is this speaking to me is this scriptural is this too far or do I have a scriptural bearing for where I'm standing at I'm not just going to try something right what a lesson what a lesson but this point that he's at in his life he's passed this test a few times he's not trigger happy so to speak he says I want to be sane and just and honest and faithful and true you see what his motives are doesn't say I want to be flashy I want to have a bigger Ministry I want to be impressive big big difference when this comes big difference what would I ask for ask what you will and it will be given to you I don't want to be led into fanaticism I want to make sure that I'm doing things right here's a good idea maybe I'll just ask him what I should ask for what wisdom this is how I want to be I don't want to be flip it with my mouth I don't want to be flip it with my life but I want to approach every situation whether it's a high anointing or a low anointing or somewhere in between what would you ask for what would you have me do would you have me bind this and cast it out or would you have me grip my teeth and bear it because you're going to teach me something right God and something just as plain as you hear my voice saying aren't you hunting and you have no game I said that's right I said if I'm doing anything wrong you forgive me if it is Lord then I'll take you by your word he's not jumping into this both feet and this is an anointing like he's never had before you can see how much Faith he's got in the anointing remember brother brandom says that Satan can come I better get back over here I'm going to get carried away he said Satan can come and give you a supernatural feeling and a glorious feeling and it'll make you feel that you're saved and you're not what's he doing he's reverting back to the word he's reverting back to the word he's checking his spirit he's checking his motives he's checking his objectives he's checking everything and then he Ventures forward very carefully if this is you Lord if it's not just check me tell me I'm wrong correct me but if this is you I will take you at your word I thought I'll find something impossible and I found an old Locust Thicket and I said there shall come a young red squirrel on on that old naked limb out yonder and I'll shoot him from right there and there came the squirrel he speaks it and it's immediately there no delay I turned the gun aimed up through the little telescopic lens I seen his eye I shot it and it dropped down so I stood there just a little bit and I said Lord if that was you I'm sorry Saints I failed the test like I felt this little inkling it said do this I did it and it happened praise God it's the Lord full steam ahead you know what happens when you get older is you walk slower amen you know why you walk slower because if you fall down you're not going to heal us quickly and you break easier it's not necessarily A Bad Thing to walk slower might just mean that you're older or it might just mean you're more mature if this was you your Bible said two or three Witnesses is a confirmation where does he go under the the most anointing that he ever felt in his entire life where does he go right back to the scripture if this was you the first was glorious the first was immediate I've it's manifested but is it scripture because the scripture says it has to happen two or three times to be you is a confirmation it can't happen a second time this is him just being honest with us it can't happen a second time but I thought believe I'll try it this is amazing because how many of us have stuck in our head what great faith the prophet used when he manifested the third pole as speaking squirrels into existence but that's not what he says he says I don't know maybe I'll try oh it happen I don't it can't happen a second time you know what I think I'll just try it I want to ask you whose Faith was this who was wanting to do something here amen right who was making this work the prophet is saying I don't even know if this is scriptural I'm going to you know put my toe in and see if the water's warm it worked but I got to have at least another witness for to be God and it can't happen a second time anyhow but I think I'll try it and I said and there shall come another squirrel and set over there and the bunch of grape Vines right there and I took my finger down and I looked back I did not see any squirrel this is different because the first time he no sooner spoke it and it was there immediately the second time he speaks it and he points and he looks and there is no manifestation this is the point that I want to get to this evening there's a delay it's not like the first time God immediately changes his manifestation I looked back and I thought well what is that there pulled up my telescope and there set a squirrel looking right at me 50 yards away I shot the squirrel walked over and picked him up the first time he speaks it and it's immediate the second time he speaks it he points there's a little bit of a delay he looks again and there's a squirrel shoots it and kills it I took off my hat I said certainly thank you sir I believe you now and you're going to do something for your people people I'm hunting Speaking Animals into existence and shooting them and he's thinking about other people why did he get to this point is because he already had the character developed that when the most greatest anointing that he has ever felt comes on him he approaches it scripturally he approaches it reverently and soon as it man manest himself itself he doesn't get caught up in what a great person he is he starts praising God and thanking him that he's going to do something for the people there is no other people out there in the woods for him I'm pretty sure this is just God doing something for him but that's not what he says thank you now you're going to do something for the people look at where this man's heart had came to it's not about me it's not about me getting my limit of squirrels today it's not about me getting what I want and having this power to do this and that thank you God you're going to do something for your people amen right I wonder you know what I wonder amen so I sure appreciate it father dear and I said now I'm going home he said but you wanted three well I said yes now that seemed like it was something inside of me I did not hear a voice but just something inside of me said that right the first is an audible voice convincing him do this do this do this he does it manifestation the second is an audible voice do this prove me he does it slight delay manifestation the third is he's praise God you're going to do something for your people while I'm going home uh excuse me you said three you wanted three no Audible Voice still Small Voice in his heart Where's God trying to get to look at this story and how fastly it's unfolding but look how quickly God is changing how he's manifesting himself amen Audible Voice Audible Voice still Small Voice in your heart yeah remember God never goes backwards God always goes forward in maturity I wonder if we would rather hear the voice in our natural ear I would I'm just being honest it's not what God wants right or that's where God would have led to right he's leading the opposite way he's leading through a natural manifestation Supernatural anointing and he's degrading to just a still small voice in his heart I did not hear a voice but just something inside of me said well I thought I'll make this one so radical it'll have to be something Supernatural and I said it shall come to pass that there will be a young squirrel go out on that limb set on the end of the limb and look over at the farmers cutting their corn shucking their corn and I'll kill him from this tree right here and I stood there a minute no squirrel looked back about five minutes passed no squirrel I thought well this is enough anyhow it's getting time for me to go and I started to walk away and as I did something said but you've already spoke it he's already checked out he's going home praise the Lord see you later excuse me you've already spoke something in my name yeah uh Mark 11:22 ringing any bells what happened to our story of the great powerful Prophet harnessing the creative power of God and I thank God for an honest Prophet sir how easily he could have exploited this he's in the woods Alone by himself me and you would have never known any different right he could have told whatever story he wanted that's right amen anyway it's getting time for me to go and I started to walk away and as I did something said but you've already spoke it I waited another 10 minutes if my West Virginia math is adding uppr right that's at least 15 minutes amen no squirrel and I said said how could a squirrel ever get out there and I started to walk away like that walked away twice after he spoke the spoken word gave up on it and walked away twice something said are you doubting oh maybe here's the point see God knows how to school you oh this is schooling going on I thought this was just great manifestation of the spoken word returning to the Fallen hybrid human race God knows how to school you this is the part that was astounding to me you would think I would think I won't put you in the same basket with me but I would think when you come to this point that God has released release the power of the spoken word unto your tongue you have arrived in the faith game amen and in all reality he was just getting started that's right you've got the power of the spoken word put on your tongue and God is still schooling you in faith let me ask you what does God care more about you having the power of the spoken word as Adam did or faith because he's using this manifestation of the spoken word to gain faith in the prophet he's you if you use something to get something that means the something that you're getting is more valuable than what you're using he is using what we what I thought for years would be the Pinnacle of your walk with Christ your restoration to what Adam lost and the prophets telling this is what God used to school me this was just something that he was using to train me what he was really after was are you still doubting what I told you and he was I'm not saying that he said it walked away twice he said no I'm not doubting and just as I said that coming out on the limb came a young squirrel walked right out on the end of the limb stood looked over at the farmers and I shot him from right there making my Three Squirrels am happy ending right two weeks later I was down in the state of Kentucky where squirrel season was still in friend of mine Mr woods and his brother-in-law and he said ask what you will and it'll be given you I said then if that be you I shall have my Three Squirrels this morning gray squirrels those were Reds up in Indiana and I said I shall have my Three Squirrels something said which way will they come from and I thought there it is I could hear it just as plain as you can hear me and I said one will come from this way one will come from back that way and one will come from that way I leaned up against a little tree and waited for a few minutes I didn't see any squirrels and it was getting late time to go back almost that's wonderful pretty powerful see how different this is than the first time the first time it was idiot the second time was a slight delay couple minutes not even a couple minutes he looked looked back look there third time was at least 15 minutes fourth time it's time to go home and nothing showed up why why if you have the power of the spoken word on your tongue why is there a delay here yeah amen because that's not what's most important this is astounding to me that manifestation is not what's most important now this is the second time second hunting trip that this happens and God does not start out where he started out the last time he starts out this hunting situation with a long delay right from the beginning I looked back across the hill and way up 125 yards I guessing something looked like it was on a stump a gray squirrel very small I looked through the telescope I couldn't tell if it was a squirrel or not I kept watching it jumped off the stump started down by the side of the tree well that's an awful long shot I'm here to tell you if you shoot a squirrel at 125 yards I want to know about it I can barely hit a deer at that distance with a gun let alone a squirrel 125 yards I just knelt down on my knee laid my gun across the side of my hand killed the squirrel brother random makes a comment he says it's not nice to shoot him up close it's not Sportsman like I'm glad he didn't Define what close was cuz I like them the closer the better I call it grocery shopping not sportsmanship I said that then the next one will have to come from this way I waited about 15 minutes so now he's waited I'm guessing all morning finally a manifestation this time you only Waits about 15 minutes stand by here comes a squirrel just as I started to level down second squirrel shows up oh you know we're doing good now first one was just hung up a little bit here's the other three the other two that's my three I said oh praise the Lord there's the second one there they are so I raised up shot the first one killed him right dead hit him right through the eye and then this other Squirrel Run jumped up on a long and it ran over the log picked up a hickory nut started eating it just perfect shot about 50 yard I thought there's my second squirrel that's 1 2 3 just what I asked for he's got it all figured out doesn't he I hope I'm not the only one that can relate to this yes sir yes sir got it all figured out I laid my gun down and shot and I hit the log now out of about 149 squirrels this year I've only missed five shots so then I thought well how did did I miss that squirrel I started waiting till almost dark I said if the other squirrel comes if if the other squirrel comes I'm going to have to shoot him real close to me cuz there's a Thicket here and he has to come down through this Thicket the only way he can well I thought well it wasn't so this time five squirrels he spoke into existence he says well it's not so this time I want to pray that one day I will be as honest as this man but I don't know that I have the courage yet to be as honest as this man that anointing maybe I just happened to get those two so I went up room picked up my squirrels and started home this delay was so long he gave up again and started home why we have to ask ourselves why and it was real dark in the hollow and I started down through the hollow something said to me what about that other squirrel and I said well I've already got to and it's so late now I can't even see through my scope hardly it's too late to get one now and I started on down God speaks to him reminds him about it and he says it's too dark now something said turn and go back and get the other another squirrel you've already said it so I turned and I hadn't walked about 10 steps and I seen a squirrel run up I mean this sounds good turn around and go back and get it while I walk about 10 steps there it is stand by that's right and I seen a squirrel run up a tree about 60 or 70 yards from me so dark it had to be just the light across the top of the mountain or I wouldn't have seen him after a while looked like a nod on the tree stuck around and I thought that's his head so I shot the squirrel ran down a tree and I heard something hit the leaves I thought he must have jumped off and about that time about 15 yards from it another squirrel run up a tree and I said that was the squirrel that I missed he run around run up that tree so I watched real close it was so dark and the wind blowing so hard I thought I seen some leaves with something moving and I thought well I'm going to shoot at it anyhow now and I shot and I heard the squirrel hit the ground plunk it really killed him outright if you're a squirrel Hunter you know what that means when they thr It On The Ground they're dead I really killed him outright he knows this he knows that sound that's a dead squirrel said well I must have missed him on that tree but I got him over here just a little bit out of line from where he had pointed I missed him where I pointed that I was going to kill him at and I shot him just a little bit over here says I'll go over and get him so I walked up the hill and when I got to the first tree there laid my squirrel the first one right in line exactly the way I pointed well that makes me four he gave me one for good measure that's good I said I I asked for three and I got four that's good now I'm going to paraphrase a lot of this so for time's sake the long story of it is he can't find this fourth squirrel if you've read the story you know this he can't find it he killed the three that he spoke right where he pointed at but he thought thought that that third one he had missed ran down ran up another tree and shot it just a little bit out of line from where he pointed well that wasn't the case he had killed the first one or the third one right exactly where he pointed and this was truly just a fourth random squirrel in the wrong place at the wrong time runs up a Trey brother brandham shoots him and this one the first one he thought he'd missed but this one falls out with a plunk that a him in all his squirrel hunting years knows that's a dead squirrel but he goes up there and he cannot find this squirrel the first the third one he didn't think he' killed it this one he knows he's killed it but he found the third one can't find the fourth one yeah but I thought you had the power of the spoken word on your tongue why can't things just go smooth why all of these ups and downs and we leaving back and forth and so he gets a stick runs it in a stump thinks that if the squirrel's in that stump he can feel something in there moving up and down but he can't cut into the stump to get the squirrel out so he goes back to the house shares the story with the Brethren he says they're all rejoicing praising the Lord and then brother Tony one of the deacons there poor guy he says he don't even remember saying these things but brother Brandon said he had to say these things but he says well brother Brandon we'll know if you're telling the truth when you go back up there in the morning with this knife and cut that squirrel out of the hole when you come back with that squirrel will know that you've told the truth and it just kills brother brandom that's right totally crushes him as a man he says uh he says Tony he didn't say this he thought this this he said brother Tony would you doubt me telling you the truth after all these years and uh I think he had something with his wife that was supernaturally healed so I mean for brother Tony to say this was just like you know saying I don't know whether I believe anything you got to say or not I mean just crushed him why you've got the power the spoken word on your tongue and you can still have your feelings hurt by a brother who loves you who in a couple hours say I don't even remember saying those things I didn't mean it like that I'm sorry why is this happening I'll tell you why but the Lord knows how to train and what to do oh so this isn't just about the manifestation of what Adam lost this this is still about my faith so going on up there that anointing struck me again and said if it isn't there Say it'll be there and you'll find the squirrel and I shall find the squirrel I said up on the mountain I went thought no need for me fearing anymore cuz I'm going to find it that's all I done said it and the Lord said when when the anointing was on me when I said anything it would be that way goes up there searches searches searches searches searches cannot find the squirrel can't find it gives up starts leaving I said I can't find it where is it at something said to me look under that piece of bark and I said yes praise the lord it's under the bark and I went over and picked up the bark and something said but what if it isn't under there why all this back and forth It's either there or it's not there right I either believe that it's there or I don't why why all the back and forth and I said oh it'll be under there and I picked it up and there was no squirrel interesting huh like I thought if you had the power of the spoken word on your tongue if you would just speak it that would be that and there would be no testing about anything there would be no trials and tribulations about anything I me remember this is God speaking not a man and I picked it up there was no squirrel and I thought that was the same inspiration that told me the three would be here the same inspiration was on me when I said that that would be here here speaking of the fourth squirrel so it's got to be and I look down there again and I seen just a little couple little gray hair sticking out from under the leaves I picked it up and there was my squirrel can't find it in the stump it says it's under the bark he says yeah it's under the bark but when he picks up the bark it ain't under the bark it's under the leaves under the bark has God ever told you one thing but not the whole story that's right God wasn't lying it was under the bark yeah right just there were some leaves under the bark that was over the squirrel brother brandom was leaving on his way going going back to the house already made up a story or a plan to get the other brothers bring them to that stump to show them what was in there moving around so that they wouldn't feel that he was lying to them because that's what the brother says if you find the fourth squirrel we'll believe you he's worried about them believing him so much that he's going to go get the brothers bring them back into the Woods show them the stump with the hole in it and show them I think he said it was like a piece of bark or Moss or something in there moving around so this is what I thought the squirrel was I'm sorry you still believe me SS you don't have all of those thoughts if you're completely sold out on your Revelation this is a man being honest with us letting us know how this works and how God trains us yeah right why because without this transparency and without this honesty me and you would never stand a chance we would be so mentally fried every day of our life that we would just go crazy it's only through proper teaching through a proper wave sheath through a proper example that we stand a chance amen remember skipping ahead several years brother brandom's up on top of the mountain and this is 1958 or 59 when this happens we get to I believe 1965 when he has the experience on the mountain very very late in his ministry right before he goes off the scene and there was a certain phrase that God used when he spoke to him we remember the story snow starts falling brother Brandman told everybody get down to the camp as quick as you can if you don't if you stay there on that mountain you're going to get snowed in it's certain death starts snowing brother brandom takes his own advice starts heading off of the mountain and God says what stop and go back stop and go back the first time he told him to do that it was over a squirrel a squirrel listen I like to eat them I love them but it's a squirrel that's right it's not really that big of a deal it's not the end of the world if I don't go back and get the squirrel fast forward a couple years it's certain death right yeah it not just a easy death either a froze to death on top of a mountain in a blizzard slow long miserable painful death if I'm wrong about what this voice is speaking to me started out here squirrel not that really big of a deal but I said stop and go back and get it few years later same same voice is telling me stop and go back into certain death I'll ask you where did he go where did he go where was his faith at then turned around and went right back up onto the mountain into the face of certain death you see the point that God's wanting to get us to yet he slay me yet I'll trust him he's either right or he's not right it's either God in our life or it's not God in our life just because everything goes sideways and I don't understand what's up down or why the difficulties or why it's not running smooth after I know what God has told me about something doesn't change what he's told us about something Faith after Revelation Faith after the Revelation the re Revelation on whatever the situation may be may not be the most important thing at all it may be a revelation that he gives you about something that may be Supernatural may come with a super anointing that may be an absolute blessing for you that you will go and testify to everybody at work about not knowing that it's simply something he's going to use to test your faith am he'll give you a revelation give you a blessing do something Supernatural to use that to increase your faith what happens when you go to work and you testify to somebody about something God did for you the first time God probably vindicates it makes you look like a superch Christian second time you testify about something it goes south why tell me why CU God's not worried about you looking like a superch Christian God's worried about your faith not worried God's interested about your faith more interested about your faith than he is about you having having a great confession and testimony among your co-workers and among your brothers and sisters that's why he will dump a super anointing on you something special major blessing and you will write it down and turn it in or you'll stand here and tell it yourself and then after you do that a few times you realize you know things get really really rough when I open my mouth maybe I'll just say thank you Jesus I'm not telling nobody cuz I don't want Satan to hear he might come and test me on what I think I believe you know God has a sense of humor too that's why he'll give people dreams or visions and after they have their first Dream and First Vision how many of them you think going keep their mouth shut none of them you have a supernatural dream Supernatural vision for the first time you're telling everybody what happens after your fifth or sixth one brother right especially when God starts sharing you stuff you don't want to see and making you have to go have have conversations you don't want to have who's proclaiming that from the housetops who's praying for more dreams and more Visions sometimes things come and you don't want them to come this is super interesting to me because brother brandom goes a couple years down the road and he finds himself in the midst of a vision on a hunting trip he's already killed a 42-in caribou and he's after a silver tip bear and his hunting guide is questioning him about it where's it going to be at brother brandom I can see for nine miles there ain't nothing here and you said it it's going to be that way thus sayith the Lord I don't know where it's going to come from God can provide are you doubting bud that's verb him what he said where did that come from who talked like that I'm venturing to say he learned something are you doubting bud but says no no I'm not doubting not after what I've seen with my brother and the eptic fit there no way I can doubt I just I don't understand how it could be here no sooner than he said that they look over and there's the bear you tell me which was more important the bear or Bud's faith I assure you brother brandham did not enjoy the schooling process that he went through with the Lord but in it he turns around and starts doing the same thing to his brother Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Church age book what does he mean by the word of my patience Hebrews 61 13-15 you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us this is the way God teaches his people patience if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life there it is Abraham was tried after he received the Word of Promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good promise of God that there could not be a trial most thank that that's what he said most people think that most of you all think that it's what the prophet said not me most of us live our daily lives like this and without Revelation we're going to keep living our daily lives like that but I say we come up a little higher I say we not let the prophets teaching experiences be in vain I I say that we don't let his exhortation and his honesty and his trans transparency be in vain I say that we grasp it and learn something from it and learn that things may not be exactly how we think we got them figured out all the time and how that they should work after he received the word of promised most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good Promises of God that there could not be a trial but hear it says the Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph 10519 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him that was the word of the Lord the prophet received out in the middle of the woods and what did it do it tried him why does the word of the Lord come to us to try us it may come with an absolute amazing Supernatural experience with with us that's not the point the point is what is it trying within me where is it taking my faith what is the purpose of it the purpose of it is not the experience the sensations or maybe even not the manifestation the purpose of everything that's a big word I'm not sure that I want to use it but I feel to use it the purpose of everything thing in our daily life in our daily walk is faith faith I feel comfortable in saying that because that's what the scripture says when the son of man returns will he find what name me one other thing he's looking for so if there's only one thing he's looking for what is everything going to be geared towards that is exactly correct I'm sorry I just read that he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life this is a huge profound statement only through patience do we actually possess life why is that because only patience can test our faith the delay the silence is the only way to test whether we have faith and if you have faith you possess life faith in God that is life but the only way to prove that you have life is to have patience patience is the testim of your faith because if you truly truly truly have faith the time delay is irrelevant the time delay is irrelevant because if it's the word of God that you have faith in it will come to pass and we have faith in that and when we express faith in that this is what brother random is trying to teach us there is no faith involved with God told me something I spoke it there it is I won't say no faith there's a little bit of Faith yes sir you understand what I'm saying yeah but it's obviously not the faith that he's wanting us to come to or he would have never invented patience he's saying yes that's Faith but now have my fa faith and my faith God's faith says I can tell you something and I can wait a million years and you will not waver I can wait however long and you will not waver I don't want to go into the dimensions because brother alexer is the expert on that but remember it's only in this dimension that there's time why is there time so that we can express patience in eternity we're not going to be able to express Faith because there's no time and there will be no patience it will be eternity I don't know how that works it just does but while we're here the point is Faith and faith comes through patience and patience is directly tied to time and it's time that is always much longer than we want it to be may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this sixth age learned patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and our lives for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in over impatience and haste I say guilty and I say God help me not to be that way we're going to go ahead and close this but I just want to ask you a couple questions how many you don't have to raise your hand but just think back on your own life the first time God supernaturally touched you and healed you how long was the delay I'm going to take a stab and say probably not very long you probably saw it in the word for the first time you prayed about it you accepted it very very shortly quickly thereafter it manifested fast forward a couple years in your life and your walk with God how long is the de the delay on your healing now I'm not saying it can't be instantaneous not saying it can't be quick I'm just asking generally is it slower or quicker than it used to be and now I'm going to ask you why right what he's done with the prophet is the same thing he's going to do for us what he's done with this manifestation of the spoken word is the same thing he's going to do in the simplest of things in the faith for our healing you tell me how much faith is required if you know you only have to wait 48 hours before it manifests you tell me how much faith is required when you don't know when it's going to happen amen or even if it's going to happen right before you die right see the difference in the levels of Faith let me ask you another one don't raise your hands on this one the first time you was ever delivered from a bad habit or a vice in your life how quickly did that take place and now a few years down the road you got something you just can't get over can't it's like a squirrel under the bark under the leaves I can't find it and I'm just going back home but he told me I would deliver you I know but I can't and it's getting dark can't even see can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel now why was the first time so quick and it was something way more difficult than this way more complex than this why the delay this is the 475th time that you've delivered me of something why is it taking that why is it taking this long since we're on the line of questions let me ask you another one first time God moved in your life you really sought God for direction in your life I mean just really sold out to him and said Lord I've got to know this answer not for selfish motives but I'm talking really seeking his kingdom really seeking his will in your life and how quick he answered I'm going to tell you my personal testimony it was less than 30 minutes and I'm talking a major major lifechanging event it made me end up in Lime Ohio it was so drastic first time I ever completely just sold out whatever he wants me to do and wherever he wants me to go it was less than 30 minutes why is it six or seven years after that there's a trial and a test so drastic that I'm even questioning that experience why like it was so profound and it and it came so quick why did you wait six or seven years and now I'm in the midst of this I'm wondering if he was not necessarily more interested in what happened back then with my faith is what he is right now with my faith but I ask you that the first time you really sold out and sought God about something how quick it come and now how long are you waiting and you are seeking him with the same level of sincerity and the same level of desperation and you cannot get an answer why Why didn't it come as easy as the first time cuz he's not after easy he's after Faith amen I'm going to challenge you you make a move for God make a move for God maybe a literal move to Li Ohio God have mercy on your soul make a move for God amen stand by for a test right might be the right move even still going to be a test involved might be six or seven laders down the road still going to be a test involved maybe it's just a spiritual move come up a little higher here's a real double dare come up a little higher and testify to a coworker or a brother or sister about it AM stand by for a test say this is pretty depressing if you don't know the answer it is right but when you have the answer and the proper teaching it should establish us and it should accomplish what he's after to increase our faith to rid us of a fourth dimension element of time right and put us right back into the real and only true dimension of God said it I believe it we're done here yeah Faith we're so desperately wanting to get into a new heavens and new earth we're going to bypass the Millennium that still has a time element in it we're so desperate to get to a new heavens and new earth to get out of this time element so we don't have to have patience anymore but it's not going to work Saints as musicians would come it's just not going to work our purpose for being here our purpose for being here is to prove to Satan that we're not like the first Eve what was the first Eve impatient yeah that's right could not wait brother brandom said did not have faith after the Revelation the Revelation was multiply and replenish the Earth nothing wrong with the Revelation praise God hallelujah we're going to multiply and replenish the Earth wake up the next day uh why aren't we multiplying and replenishing the Earth what's going on here I want to be a mommy why can't I be a mommy everybody else is a mommy Faith after the Revelation first sale brother brandham says in Revelation 12:7 Satan the spirit the devil which is up there now the accuser of the Brethren this is a name of the devil accuser a title of the devil accuser of our Brethren when the church is taken up Satan is cast out when the church goes up up Satan comes down when the church goes up Satan goes down that is an event that will happen that can be an event that's happening right now though when you come up in Revelation Satan is cast down I'm going to tell you why is because the accuser of the Brethren is a title and the scripture that we read at the beginning of the service says that there has to be two witnesses in order for anything to hold up preferably three so when you come up and you do not confess doubt when you do not confess impatience when you do not confess disbelief in God's word the accuser of the Brethren is standing there by himself trying to accuse the brethren in violation of God's law yeah because he's standing by himself his testimony will not hold up right there has to be a second testimony that's why I would encourage you do not join him in confessing impatience do not join him in confessing unbelief do not join him in confessing frustration right do not let his accusation hold weight in the court of God's law amen amen he has nobody else to help him establish his testimony it has to come off of your lips without it he is kicked out of court it will not hold water right that is an event that will happen in the future literally I believe in the spiritual realm but that's an event that's happening right now in our daily lives do not give the accuser of the Brethren place in your life Saints you have the power to rid him of that position Amen Let Your confession be yay and amen Revelation 12 says and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love their lives not to the death I've read this differently today and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony I've always read that by the word of their testimony being the group The Bride collectively but I've come to find out that's not how God wants me to read it God wants me to read it that they by the word of their testimony their equals me and God amen amen right yeah I love you dearly you confess whatever you want to confess my testimony is is the word of God and by the blood of the lamb and by their testimony equal sign me and God we will overcome if you want to overcome with us confess what he says amen but I'm no longer going to take a group mentality towards that scripture I will overcome because I'm not going to confess what Satan confesses I'm going to confess what God has confessed and their testimony mining God's testimony will overcome there's a semicolon in that verse though and there's a qualification for that they love not their lives unto death though he slay me I'm still going to trust him that's the only way we're going to get anywhere with Christ is when we die out to our reasoning when we die out to our intellects when we die out to what our brothers and sisters think about the situation and when we stick to God's word that is only when we can say I have the same testimony that Christ has Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him let's stand together without faith it is impossible to please him how many wants to please God careful careful if you want to please God by default you are signing up for a delay in the promised word taking place in your life so that you can express patience so that you can express Faith which will then please God it's the squirrel under the leaves under the bark say what go back to the beginning and read the story it's the squirrel under the leaves under the bark he don't tell you about the leaves all the time he'll tell you it's under the bark you said it would be there I said it would be there it's going to be there what about all the leaves you never told me about all the leaves and there were just like two little hairs sticking out from there he don't have to tell you everything if he told you everything there would be no faith Luke 188 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth I think God's interested in our faith that's I think he is focused on our faith I think I think and I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure and I'm getting more sure by the day that everything in my daily life revolves around me expressing more faith in God's word in one of these days I'll Express so much Faith I'll have the power of the spoken word on my tongue and when that happens he'll use it as a tool to make me Express more faith and when I speak it and it doesn't immediately come to pass let's get our eyes off the man stations and let's get our eyes on the purpose and the point brother brandom did not say that we were placed here to not like be the first Eve and have the power of the manifestation of the spoken word in our tongue he said we were placed here to prove to Satan that we're not like Eve because we're not going to take our own way we'll wait on God we'll believe his word and we'll have the patience to let him manifest it whenever he wants to manifest it if that comes with a great Supernatural experience praise the God praise God I will take all of them that he wants to give me and yours if you don't want them but that's not my focus that's not my purpose my purpose is to express the utmost faith in whatever he's telling me whatever the situation whether it's Doctrine or whether it's Monday morning amen faith in how however he leads me in so much that it would get to the point shocker that he don't even have to speak to me in an audible voice for me to have faith may just be a still Small Voice in my heart Pentecostal is not going to go for that not enough manifestation there what are you doing today I'm just I'm going to I'm going to do what God whispered in my heart you mean he never even told you you didn't hear what are we focused on what's more important to you one last quote and I'm closing on promise let the holy spirit this is what the prophet's telling us this is what he's telling us this is his instructions for our life you can go and play something softly brother Chad if you'll come let the Holy Spirit live in the church and make way that's when you'll have real meetings listen to your pastor see if the devil see if the devil can't keep you from seeing the real thing of God he will push you off on the deep end with it he'll make you go to a ftic you don't have to be fanatical there's too much real and genuine to have to be a fanatic but listen to your pastor a God sent man a teacher that'll send and tell you just exactly what to do because himself is Anointed with the Holy Ghost and watch him he will stay right smack with the word you stay right with the word and every time you receive the word you receive life God gave you a checkbook when you received the Holy Ghost with Jesus name wrote at the bottom of it for whatsoever you desire question are you afraid to fill it out because if you fill it out you might have to manifest patience you might have to manifest faith I wonder saints that if we get so bogged down in our carnality that we know if we ask for something it's going to cost us something it's going to teach us something and we just don't ask I wonder I wonder if we're Hesed to really seek God with our whole heart because we know what it might cost us it's easy to do at the beginning it's easy to do I won't say easy it's easier to do it's almost like you do it without thinking it you're so bad off you know you got to have God in your life so you just sell out to them and after a couple years you realize how painful this selling out is and you start backing up on that you start backing up on that m i maybe I'm okay maybe I don't need to come higher maybe I won't us to be a little bit more like Jesus today I wonderful hesitant to reach out for his fullness because we know it's going to cost us patience and an expression of Faith he says his name's wrote at the bottom of it for whatsoever you desire are you afraid to fill it out ask what you will in my name God will give it to you I like that oh my stand there with just unadulterated ated Faith ask and believe and it shall come to pass that's the way to do it he doesn't tell us to back up take it easy simmer down just a minute stop pressing no he says we've got a blank check for the word of God in our lives fill it out fill it out out make the deposit it's worth the cost it's worth the effects I don't want you to take this as a rebuke this evening I'm in the same boat you're in but I would be foolish to try to present to you that God operates in our lives today the same way that he operated yesterday a week ago couple years ago he doesn't do it he never did it for the prophet that wasn't the example the example was I am constantly going to be increasing your requirement of faith in me but I'm going to encourage you along the way I'm going to show you it'll work I'm going to give you a powerful manifest St I'm going to speak to you I'm going to give you instructions when you seek me I'm going to give you the answer you desire but let's be mature let's understand that that might come along with something there might be some leaves under the bark that's on top of your squirrel get back up there and find it God bless you this evening brother Chad as I look back on this road I've traveled I see so many times he's carried me through and if there's one thing that I've learned in my life my redeemer is faithful and true oh my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is Fai my redeemer is faithful and true and everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are [Music] you my redeemer is Fai amen we found him to be faithful and true but I want to be faithful to him as well I want my faith to grow in a way that's pleasing to him and now we learn that God is training us teaching us growing our faith I marveled sitting in my seat how wonderful the word of God is and how instructional it is and brother B's life teaches us so much I always thought it was amazing that God allowed a man use the power of the spoken word to create a scroll into existence just to shoot it seconds later and then to eat it I thought it seemed odd to me not bad like wrong but just odd but I realized it wasn't about the squirrels it was about the lesson that's what came to life to me that God wanted to show through this Prophet what it was going to be like to have real faith and he was honest about it it wasn't his faith it wasn't himself as a person that conjured this up that had great faith it was something God wanted to do through him so God took him by the hand and L him through it oh God take us by the hand and lead us through so that we just do what you want train us to have the right kind of Faith so that we can serve your purpose amen I just read a quote the other day uh I think it was yesterday I read a quote that tied in with what our brother was saying at the end he said about the testimony of our our their witness brother B said Christ voted for me the devil voted against me now it depends on which way I cast my vote oh God help us to cast our vote with god with the word just to believe the word despite the obstacles despite the personal cost just let's just stay with the word amen I appreciated that today it was edifying for me I needed it I say God I know that you want me to grow I want to grow sometimes we avoid pain but pain is what's causing growth and I don't want to avoid pain I don't want pain I I I I don't want it but what I want more than anything is to be pleasing to to him it may require a little bit of confusion or uncertainty or patience but I want to be like him amen that was wonderful I want to close in a word of prayer tonight but so I just when I got to my seat I realized that I had forgot to ask God to heal our sister Doris and she wrote in Megan her granddaughter called in and asked for our prayers and I forgot so I want to remember that now so let's bow our heads together and pray dear heaven Heavenly Father we thank you God for the instruction that you gave us tonight so thankful Lord that you used the vessel Lord a human Lord that you can work through that you plac the gift in so that you yourself could come and speak to us and instruct us oh we're so thankful that you worked in the life of your servant Lord your Prophet that you might set an example so that we might have eyes to see the way in which you work and God you brought it to us fresh tonight so that we might not be discouraged in our waiting times but Lord may we realize this is what you're looking for this is what you're wanting to prove to Satan that you have a bride that'll wait a bride that'll believe a bride that will stay with your word and God we truly want to be that for you Lord we want to be a vessel that you can work through we just pray God You' strengthen us that you would continually encourage us in your word open our eyes that we might see what you're doing so that we can get with your program Lord that we can make it easier for you to use us as we wait patiently for you we patiently on you we wait patiently for you God May our confidence be solidly placed in you that if you spoke it you cannot fail that if you said it was true it will always be true if you ever dropped it in our heart then it's a reality and may we stay with your word before anything else Lord above our thinking above our feelings above circumstances May our tra trust and faith be in you God you're growing us help us to grow Lord God I pray that you would bless our sister Doris who's in St Reed is now with the complications to this line she has for dialysis her granddaughters asked us to pray sister Doris wants us to pray and Lord we want to bind our faith with hers we want to take you at your word and we want to recognize Lord that you made a promise for our sister Doris that by your stripes she's healed God we don't understand the circumstances and why more trouble but we've heard tonight that it's not outside of your program not outside of your plan and definitely not outside of your purpose so I pray that you give my sister Doris strength to wait patiently for your promised m word to manifest in her life we pray that you would give her relief Lord give her strength that you would give her good help and aid while she's there at the hospital and that the word that you promised her would come to a manifestation or that you would deliver her heal her and strengthen her Lord we commit ourselves to you asking that you would just help us to grow into your very likeness Lord that we would constantly Lord use every opportunity we have to take sides with you not with our enemy Lord we pray that you bless our brother Benjamin we're so thankful Lord that he got out of the way and yielded himself to you and I pray that you would refresh him strengthen him that you would help him in a very special way and bless him in a very special way bless him and his family Lord we pray God as we go our way we pray you would just help us to go with a fresh Vision with more isav having been rubbed in our eyes by Your Word with a clear perspective on the life that we're living that we wouldn't be taken in traps and we wouldn't be troubled by is issues and situations but we would stand fast in the faith that you've given us we love you Lord we thank you for these things we ask you to bless us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you brother joh my heart rejoices when I read the promise that there's a place where I'm preparing for you I know that someday Lord face to face my redeemer is faithful and true and my
