[0:00] when you heard the word you know where
[0:02] you come from you know what was the
[0:04] truth you were always the seed was in
[0:06] you always the word seen the word seen
[0:09] the word the word that was in you that
[0:12] was before the foundation of the world
[0:14] saw the word and you came to
[0:17] it so when you heard the message of the
[0:19] hour when you heard the true word for
[0:21] our day when God said let there be light
[0:23] and there was light when God told us
[0:25] that there would be a restoration of the
[0:27] word and there was a restoration of the
[0:28] word when he said Malachi 4 and there
[0:30] was a Malachi 4 when you saw that light
[0:33] shine amen the
[0:36] word heard the
[0:39] word what word the word that was down
[0:41] inside of you as a c genene of God heard
[0:44] the word for the hour and when the word
[0:46] heard the word I'll say it again the
[0:48] word that was in you that was before the
[0:50] foundation of the world saw the word and
[0:52] you came to
[0:54] it why because you weren't going
[0:57] anywhere till you heard the word
[1:00] we were born listen you and I were born
[1:03] with the c Gene of God we were
[1:04] predestinated to be children of God to
[1:07] be part of his bride in the end time I
[1:08] believe that with all my heart I believe
[1:10] that I'm part of that and I believe by
[1:12] Grace you're part of
[1:14] that but because we were born that way
[1:16] and there was a germinated seed laying
[1:18] in US it wasn't as though when we were
[1:20] sitting in a Baptist Church or sitting
[1:21] in a Christian school or sitting
[1:23] wherever you were like nope that's wrong
[1:24] this is the truth that's the truth this
[1:26] is wrong I'm bride you didn't know
[1:28] anything
[1:30] the life was there the seed was there it
[1:32] was all there amen but nothing was
[1:35] happening it was not producing any life
[1:37] it was not bearing any fruit it wasn't
[1:39] doing anything why because faith comes
[1:41] by hearing you had to hear the
[1:43] foolishness of preaching you had to hear
[1:45] the word you had to hear the word for
[1:47] your day and see the manifestation of it
[1:50] and when you did the word from before
[1:52] the foundation of the word saw the word
[1:55] and you came to it because Faith cometh
[1:58] by hearing
[2:00] and hearing by the word the word heard
[2:04] the
[2:05] word where did the ears to hear come
[2:07] from from the word where did you get
[2:09] those ears when I was in God before the
[2:11] foundation of the world as an attribute
[2:13] of God and part of God that's where I
[2:15] got those ears from those are the ears
[2:17] that hear the word it's not these ears
[2:21] amen if it was these ears if Faith
[2:23] cometh by hearing the word of God then
[2:25] we're going to sit everybody down and
[2:27] force them into 24hour a day hearing of
[2:29] the word of God cuz that's all it
[2:33] takes no the word has to hear the
[2:40] word the ears of the word have to hear
[2:44] the present tense preaching of the word
