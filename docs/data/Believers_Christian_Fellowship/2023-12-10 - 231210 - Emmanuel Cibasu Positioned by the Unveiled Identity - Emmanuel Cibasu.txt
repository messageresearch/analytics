sometimes we can become indifferent and Lord you summoning us this morning we don't want to be that we want to be aware made fully aware of the day we're living in of the very life very scripture the very prophecy you are fulfilling in our very lives Lord we we are so little as we approach you Lord It's So insufficient Lord physically naturally even spiritually frail but yet we're so blessed the Lord and the same time to know that we are here by your ordinance we're here by your choosing we're here by your election and what you reserved for us in this very last day Lord our mind will never even wrap our thoughts around it it will take you this morning we just ask father as you gave us your promises father you said in the Book of Matthew that where two or three are gathered in my name where am I in their midst father we more than two this morning and we have come father we have no other name the only name we have father it's this name you have graciously revealed to us by the sounding and the voice of the seventh angel of the seventh seal and this is the name we're gathered under this morning and Lord we are so confident we're trusting in thee knowing that father there's no man who can help one another it will take you to come and we are inviting you this morning Lord to take your word father to break the bread of life to not only open your scripture father but open our understanding to see you standing in our midst this morning and father that that Resurrection father it's a reality in our life this morning we just want to approach you bless the reading of your

father you will be in your position in each and every one of us father serving Lord this glorious body of Jesus Christ we love you we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you all musicians thank you you may be seated for a little while I am breing greetings uh from our pastor so he did uh call me and uh we did talk they are having great meetings and uh this week they will be also so very busy with the meetings just keep them in your prayers I've been there in those in the on the mission field and the mission field unless you're there you probably will not have a full understanding of it the enemy could use even the water you're drinking to cut you off even the food you're eating even the place you're sleeping because it's not your home you can be Sleepless so there just so many many many things that the enemy would like to put his hand on to disturb to discourage not only that they might be there and they feel something coming from back home something happened that's how the enemy does not only we pray for them we pray for their families that are left behind and uh prayers unless you are away unless you are in need you can know really what it means to you so let's keep them in pray prayers and uh I know that uh this morning I have only a few scriptures and a few quotations and it's you who's going to be pulling that out and I trust that the Lord will speak to us this morning let's stand and just read the a scripture but before we can read that scripture there's a a little quotation from the prophet in 1955 in the the message the way to have Fellowship you might be the scripture would be in uh The Book of John chapter 18 while you are looking into that chapter 18 let's find that before I can read the the the quotation and also find the verse if you are there just put your hand there and just listen to this quotation the prophet of God said just think when he says that something within me what are you going to be thinking about it's not your friend who telling you hey let's think this is an ordained prophet of the age and we will see the later on as we'll be reading the scripture if you still have him as a prophet you have the Sixth Seal if you still have him as your Prophet as a prophet you're not there yet we've been visited by more than a prophet he said just think job the oldest book of the Bible he longed for Fellowship how many long for Fellowship this morning I long for that he knew there was a Creator and he believed him with all of his heart amen and he said in a child child way of saying it oh if I could only get to him if I only knew where he lived at I could go up and knock on his door and talked to him just a little while now job the prophet of God said that he was uh he was a lawyer he was a man very intelligent he was advising counseling thousands of his generation he was high Man full of knowledge or so blessed the go the word of God said he was perfect in his day but look what a perfect man naturally you could not equal him spiritually God chose him elected him but that man longed for something said I could go up and knock on his door and talk to him just a little while wouldn't we we all love to do that we would and the prophet of God say says but think he is God he is closer to you than his door his door he is closer to you than his door we're looking for his door the prophet job is looking for his door but the prophet of God in this day said he's closer to you than his door and he said his door is your heart you want to go knock on his door knock at your heart amen amen and if you want to find him you have to already have invited him in your heart amen so whenever you want to knock at his door you can knock at your heart's door and say are you still there if he's not in your heart where are you going to be finding him right so you've got to have invited him first in your heart he said and he's so close tonight he's closer to you than your right arm is he's a part of you and if we can only realize that he's here amen if we can only realize that he is here he is not risen sitting up on the tomb or risen and went up to heaven and having a party there he's risen and he's still here and this morning he's here amen said and how he wants to fellowship with us his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours are when you desire within you to fellowship with God that's not even 1% of what he wants to do with you and the reason he makes us that way because we are offsprings of his amen we are off Springs of his what would happen if this morning sorry to keep you standing but we're going to be reading the the scripture you'll be you'll be sitting down I'll be S standing what would happen this morning if Bill Gate would come and just brother don't you know that you are my Offspring this morning what would happen in your mind what would go on in your mind right right I'm me offspring of multi billionaire probably some of the pressures of a house car payment house mortgage payments that pressure just before even you can even get a check before he can even tell you that hey I'm going to make you a check they fade away he said that's what makes us long for Fellowship that's what makes a mother would die for her baby let's go to the scripture reading John chapter 18 verse 28 to get uh just the thought there John 18 verse 28 he he goes then LED they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the Hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the Judgment Hall lest they should be defiled but they might eat the Passover you might you might sit down so we can I will keep read in the the remaining Jews could not even walk into C's home they deemed themselves so holy there couldn't be this who they have the one they have arrested they arrested him not last night last evening that evening he didn't sleep that evening he was standing from going from HS to Halls from the Hall of anus C's father-in-law from there to cus Hall from there to Pilot's Hall the entire evening and it was very cold because remember Peter wanted to be warmed outside and the Jews when the day was over when from the evening it passed into the next day they said into that Hall we cannot even walk in we are so holy we we are part partaking of the Passover we cannot stand with that despised man there not knowing that we're standing in the presence of the very Passover the very one that was the pillar of fire taking them to through the Wilderness By Night the pillar of cloud by day amen amen he was standing there I said we want we don't want to go in because we want to take our Passover easily we holy he couldn't speak a word pilate then 29 pilate then went unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man they answered and said unto him if he were not a malactor the Passover the true Passover the Lamb of God was a malactor to the Jews we would not have delivered him up unto thee then said Pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law right then the the the the the the scripture the prophecy is unfolding itself do you remember when Jesus was on Earth he told them that I will be delivered my brother will be delivering me the Jews will be delivering me the Jews will not kill me they will be delivering me they will be rejecting me but the one who's be carrying out the killing the Gentiles will do and then we're going to see those those identities being just opened up in the scripture cuz they were hiding you can do something in hiding but when God's if it's in the prophecy it's going to be opening up we will know who is doing what am then 31 then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the Jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us okay they are now identifying themselves as who the Jews to put away a man to death they did recognize not how we have a law now but with within our law We cannot put a man to death and that was true in the Ten Commandments you could not kill a person it was forbidden 32 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled uhoh there was a saying there there was a prophecies there that must be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die that death was to be carried he was to be rejected by the Jews handed over to the Gentiles to achieve him to do the crucifying because they were specializing into that professionals 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again torn he was torn this man but you know what you could be torn you can struggle you can do your own your effort will bring nothing it's his ordination it's his election and called Jesus and said unto him are thou a king of the Jews Jesus Jesus answered him saith thou sayth thou this thing of thyself or did other tell it thee of me uh-oh is this message is someone telling it to you or is it something that you know it's coming from you know of that you know that you know that you know that this is it pilate answered answered now he's going to be exposing his identity too am I a Jew okay so we know that he was not a Jew then thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him are thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my word my my voice as you are standing there we just bow our heads again precious Lord we have read these precious words that have been father washed over for Generations many of our precious brothers and sisters s gave with their blood that could not even come closer to yours just for these writings could be kept as we're reading them Father We Are The Most Blessed people we read them with reverence whether we do we don't understand them but just knowing what it costs for us to have them and father we ask that you will come and just open your word and teach us father and bless you children and all of us together in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you this morning I was uh as we're driving in I uh just happened to ask my daughter a question I said why would it be W what benefit would it be to you if the Son of God whom you know that he Christ God in the human flesh would come down from heaven and would just be going visiting Parks visiting the hospital full of love going from bed hospital bed to another hospital bed full of compassion saying I will come in I will visit you you need something I can bring to you you will bring you a cup of water bring you some medication he would leave there he would go maybe to the library read some newspapers sometimes when he gets a little asleep or sleeps there send people in the library they might sleep a little bit there and he would rest and would wake up would go help one one person there and then when there are there are mass mass murders somewhere mass shooting somewhere he would come there who try to get all the wounded or maybe those that need to be taken care in the hospital he would go there and just try to do his best said knowing that he's doing that what would what benefit would you get from that you know who he is you have his full identity what benefit would you get from that there's no benefit because if my kids are are shoot and and killed he would just come after they are shoot to be compassionate but he would not help prevent it so he is a Son of God the Son of God just having his um compassionate work on Earth no the benefit would be if he takes my place he takes the place of my children of my grand children of my brother and my sister that's what he's supposed to do so having an identity without a position that's right there's no benefit to that he would be identified fully identified as the Messiah as the Son of God but as long he's not in his position I have no benefit Christians are the same way that's how I brought this little subject uh this little title of positioned by the unveiled identity once your identity is unveiled Amen to be able to be in God's steps of fulfillment of the scripture you must be positioned it is is positioned by the unveiled identity the prophet of God says this about the scenario that was happening here here's a Jesus standing before the Jews there about to crucify him he said in the questions and answered 1963 but remember God is infinite so where he was standing there he was infinite infinite what it is let listen to The Prophet do you believe that infinite and then he is omniscient do you believe that omniscient means he knows all things he can't be omniscient without being infinite excuse me if I take this this he said he can't be omnicient without being infinite see there never was nothing but what he knew all the scenarios that were going around him the Jews trying to convince as many people as they could he saw he knew all those things he knew every n that would ever be on earth um I had to look it up the N A Nat I'm from another country I was said what is a n it's said you know it better than than me right it's a small tiny insect yeah oh yeah how many of them would be on earth just maybe on if if they live only for maybe let's put they live for a few days or a couple of hours just maybe in in in an hour how many of them would would be on earth he said he knew every na that would ever be on Earth that would ever so since the world has been he knows every one of themall and how many times it would bat its eyes uhuh he's going deeper into that and how much Tallow it would make I had to look those things up how much all of them make together he knew every breath that you would breathe and how deep it would go in your lung you're talking about our Jehovah this is my father this is your father you're talking about a father you have it it's it's blowing your mind and he says that's infinite oh oh that's the definition of infinite we can go to the thesaurus dictionary and said we're going to change that definition infinite means this right now if he infinite if that makes him omniscient is that right and if he is omniscient that makes him omnipresent th those those are big words because he knows just exactly the minute hour time to the split instance of the listen to that I have to go slowly on this one he has because he knows just exactly the minute we're going slower the hour the time to the split instance of 55,000 of a second oh we getting that 55,000 of a second so before I can do this I'm late completely late to when it's going to happen see get the idea now we don't get it I personally don't get it I want to be a liar I don't get it but I believe it we believe it then he knows all things and that's the reason he has all power knows all things and can do all things he knew before the world began we would be sitting here if he knew before the world began that we would be sitting here my prayer is could you identify me on the right side of the prophecy cuz you could be sitting here in the same time the Jews were there pilate were there they were he knew they were sitting there in the prophecies is being there and he knew that he would be standing there among them he was fulfilling the right side of the prophecy and they were fulfilling the wrong side of the prophecy and the way we can fulfill the right side of the prophecy knowing that we're sitting here this morning know what let's believe him amen if there was something that we walked in this morning little doubt just let's look into that door let let's go to that door find him in your heart in my heart this morning said God kick that unbelief out he said he knew how many times I would raise my hands up and down am now he he knew the words I would say he knew how many times you would bat your eyes what you think before the world ever started what are we afraid about God is our father oh listen to that so the only way to summarize all these these great words and this great thinking right it has to be a father and I know that growing growing up in this congregation me included we have no idea of what a father means toddlers knows no better right cuz when you said my father you think oh I can think like him I can build like him I can do like him we grown-ups but for toddlers their fathers is the hero their fathers their father is the solution Giver every T knows that his dad can fix an airplane why they have greater Faith than we we have grown up we growns up we have lost am we have lost the meaning the content the depth of what a father means and glad that God has sent us this messag Amen to take us back there so we can know what a really a father means so having these Great ACT attributes of God being omniscient omnipresent infinite now let's go back into that Pilot's Hall and let's see him standing there identified to others as the Son of God to others as a manactor right he was standing there knowing all things he didn't sleep all night rejected by his own standing there knowing that in a couple hours from now my face will be filled with spit of drunken soldiers knowing that from now my face will be bleeding my entire body will be shivering shaking he knew all things knowing that his beard were to be proed off and jerked from his face he knew that a spear was about to to be R run into his heart the creation they were mocking him beating him making fun of him as a prophet of God said that a 10 pound Roman spear had to be prepared to crush that heart he knew that few hours away from that he knew knew that what going to happen before the afternoon all these things are going to be taking place he knew that in a few hours from now the the the moon the Sun the Stars will will will not give their light they will run away to see their great Creator on the cross he knew the Rocks would be run off the mountain and the Earth was about to shake he knew that things were about to fall knowing that the veil is going to be turned today that Veil that they never gone be be behind it in the temple today it's that day just a couple of words from now standing there now he was standing there not because he did any wrong though he was the son of God God himself in a human flesh ident fully identified his identity fully unveiled to be this son of God Peter and others they saw him going to the to to the the tomb of Lazarus as he was walking a man who has dead been dead for 4 days this dust man with dust on his clothes Jesus would walk up there Lazarus come come forth his his disciples have seen that they have witnessed that the power of that man they have seen him feeding more than five 5,000 people 5,000 men not counting the women and the children with just a few loaves of bread and and two fishes they've seen him doing that doing great things walking on the water and hear his standing there could not even speak a word knowing all things Peter and the disciples out we don't have time to go into the scripture that you know that Peter was out but before the scripture could be fulfilled one of the disciples who was in who was friend to the high priest has to go get Peter in because he has to be in a position to deny Jesus face to face cuz that scripture could not be fulfilling of of him denying him after the the has U um had done three times he had to be inside he had to be in a position that he can be looking at Jesus the once the C Crow crows he could see he could be facing Jesus so everything has to be the scripture had to be fulfilled the prophecy had to be fulfilled he's standing there why was he to be standing there because not only he was fully identified he had to be positioned he was in a position he was in the line of duty to save you and me amen as the Lamb of God he has to be standing there lower than Angels spit by every man who was around anyone who who want to spit on him they had the right to do that so we see three three parties here we see the Jews we see the Romans represented by pilate and the soldiers with the Christ Christ knew exactly who he was who his identity was and he knew exactly what he was fulfilling he knew his position he knew I'm standing here today there's no one else who could do it Adam's race was to be redeemed he was standing there fulfilling the scripture and there were two others the Jews and the Romans they did mention their attributes their identities but had having no clue what they were doing right I'm just skipping a lot of things here as the time is uh slipping away so just think that the blindness of the Jews and the pilot of of the Jews and pilot they were blind to their position their identities they would know their identities but they were blind to their position what they were doing there and as they had this man who was standing there the creator of Heaven and Earth for them he was someone who was disturbing their nature their religion he was causing their tribulations he was judging them wrongly because they had the law and this man was judging them so they had Christ standing there for them Christ represented the The Sixth Seal but the same Christ there representing the seventh seal for others for Peter and the others Peter was in a silent mode and the disciples they didn't know what was happening they confused heaven in Silence the disciples in silence looking at the men who could bring one to to life after 4 days who could feed thousands who could walk on the water and now he cannot even move Peter and and disciples could not understand that they could not explain that silence he was the seventh seventh seal for them but for this Jew and pilate this man was the worst this one is disturbing our religion he he's he's he he's disturbing our way of life Sixth Seal for them seventh seal in in in in in so much that as a prophet of God said let me just read this he said the seven seal seventh seal brings him back to the Earth amen the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned what he had redeemed so he was here this seventh seal brought him back on Earth he was the work in the work of redemption the work of redeeming every one of them those were on the book on the Book of Life the seventh seal for Mary Magdalene or The Sixth Seal for those Pharisees right seventh seal for Mary Magdalene in such a way that even when those two angels came to her what are you weeping for said they have taken my Lord if the same question was asked to the Jews take that malifa her away the prophet of God said in God's provided way now God has always had a way I love that always what whatever you you're going through whatever you might be experienced whether today or tomorrow or any time let's let's let let let me read this we can take it home God has always had a way don't be shut in in that condition in that situation in whatever it's going on in your life right now whether it's a sickness whether it's a confusion family fuse or something going on there's a way amen he is that way am he's got a way tonight like we can say he's got away this morning amen and God always before he sends a judgment he always makes a way of Escape out of every trial God makes a way of escape and God makes a way before he sends his judgment I might say first before he sends judgment he always sends mercy and if you spurn Mercy am there's nothing left but judgment and you have judged yourself those Jews had judged themselves they spurned mercy what was the seventh seal for others became the Sixth Seal to them what was mercy and deliverance and Redemption for others became their judgment and their condemnation in the same time am the very same subject the very same identity becoming condemnation for one becoming Deliverance for one right depending on which position are you in right amen which side are you in amen and the prophet keeps on saying notice the word that's ordained for each age when that word is made manifest that's Christ of that day just like it was in each one of the the the the days now when we find Jesus coming on the scene he was rejected yet he was the promised word now in Deuteronomy we don't have time because I see it's so sleeping so yeah it's going fast so we we'll just do a weekend I'm afraid of that time there yeah almost no it says when we find Jesus coming on the scene he was rejected yet he was the promised word now in dety 18 18:15 Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like like me and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall not hear this Prophet will be cut off from among the people now there he was exactly the prophet for that age and the teachers of that day didn't see it they finally put him to death and if we might not have time to go in the book of Deuteronomy 18:15 you will find out that it says that the one that would not hearken that angel that he will not listen to him or pay attention to him God would would require of him meaning God will investigate again will seek with care what happened so they were in in kind of I might say in a kind of a better position even in the Book of Numbers we we might not have time to go that in the Book of Numbers you will find God saying and this is before the laws before Deuteronomy before God gave Moses the Commandments God is saying that that you know what if all the Commandments The Ten Commandments if they Heir ignorantly anyone HS ignorantly to do it to observe all the Ten Commandments there was still room for Mercy there was still room for Mercy but there was no room for Mercy for those that when the word is made flesh in your day you challenging that word right I wish we can have time to read those there was no way for them let's let's just go there there sorry sorry let Let's Take Time Deuteronomy 18 if you would uh didn't put it in here but we can read it Deuteronomy 18 it's not sunny outside so we don't have to rush out so there's nothing there anyway it's it's gloomy let's stay inside so Deuteronomy 18 goes uh 15 the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of Thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearen now let's see who would not Haren that 16 according to all that thou desired of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the days of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God neither let me see the great fire anymore that I die not and the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken 18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their bre Brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth amen and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him now listen to 19 and it shall come to pass that who soever will not Hur Heen unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him meaning I will not kill him or cut him off I will investigate I still have mercy I still have mercy I will require I will examine and I will I will see what judgment I can give him but listen to the 20th 20th verse but but oh when it comes but something is changing there but the prophet which shall presume presume here means which shall which shall come presumptuously which will challenge which will will will come to question to to to yeah to question I will find the the word here which shall be def which would be defiant which be defiant or rebellious proudly to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die there there was no requiring death was striking you right away yeah let's go take um The Book of Numbers it's just uh a book before Deuteronomy if you go back uh numbers 15 and as we're going through this you might said why are we flipping these pages to find what in short sentences it's just that this message you can if if you cannot live the life of this message that it's not for you zip your mouth amen zip your mouth stay away from it don't say anything just said I cannot live it or I had my I've given you this testimony before I'm the last of in my family the oldest of my family is passed on a few years back he could not believe the message but he knew it was the truth when I presented it to him he would tell his own children if you want just a God where you can play have fun of this world follow me in my church but if you want the the god that can transform your life the god of Heaven follow my brother Emanuel he never believed it it was too harsh he respected it he said it's not for me yeah God would understand someone in that position amen but when you are rising up to start speaking against this message because this word that has been made flesh in this generation you have no other forgiveness amen if you have family members that do that we do have them just say just sip your mouth 15 let's start with 22 that's what we're going to be uh reading if you find it and if ye so this is God telling the children of Israel if ye have AED and not observed a l all these Commandments which the Lord has spoken unto Moses if you have AED so you have made mistakes ignorantly you have not walked according to these laws all of them even all 23 even all that the Lord has commanded you it's a all the Ten Commandments even all that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the Lord commanded Moses and hence and hence forward among your Generations then it shall be if ought to be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bull bulock for a burnt offering for a sweet savior so I'm not going to finish that but we he's telling them hey you can offer this you can do this the the priest will do this will stand on your behalf that there was a way for you for me to forgive you to bring in but let's come down to to 28 and the priest shall make an an atonement for the soul that sinth ignorantly when the sinth when he sinth by ignorance before the Lord to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him you see there's forgiveness there but if you go to 30 verse 30 now but we see the same word again coming up that the soul that doeth ought presumptuously this word presumptuously means rebelliously proud you saying that God has also spoken to me but the soul that that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproaches the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off from among his people because he has despised the word of the Lord and has broken what not the these Commandments his commandment one commandment of the Lord once the word is made flesh in your day it becomes the only commandment that's right that once you go beyond that death has struck you amen so Christ was treated by one portion as the seventh seal by another group The multitude treating him as the SI seal their condemnation their judgment he's disturbing their nature and for the others he was the seventh seal now you can even have him as the seventh seal we bring it closer you can have him as the seventh seal but under which Angels because when the seventh seven seventh seal opened up Seven Angels were in the Seven Seals each one of them were was given a trumpet but there was only one who had eight trumpet and the voice so which angels are you which Angel are are you under within the seventh seal they sounded and the prophet of God said that all the seven trumpets even the seventh of the seventh angel were sounded under the Sixth Seal so which angels are you under within the seventh seventh seal are you under the Sixth six other Angels their trumpets were destroyed abbing the N nature so you within the seventh seal you've got to be under the seventh messenger who had both the trumpet and the voice and when you have that voice Revelation 108 said that voice was sounding from where from heaven so this message sorry that let's go into it when you listening or hearing it from your heart where is it coming from if you hearing it from on from the Earth from interpretation of man there's no there's no Mighty angel that you will go to meet amen it has to be you you have to be hearing this voice from Heaven amen am because once you hear it from Heaven it will send you to the mighty angel that is on Earth that go take your book The open book so we might be feing this message but have we heard it from heaven or we still hearing it from the earth right we know that everyone claims they have Jesus right everyone claims he has Jesus we are coning that to them very fine you have it you have Jesus do you have him as the Sixth Seal or the seventh seal am if you do have him as the seventh seal do you have him as the voice under the seventh messenger seventh angel or under the six other Angels within the seventh seal do you have him as a your judge or your attorney tell us so you said you have Jesus do you have him as a Slicker or you have him as a husband right who takes care of you whom you can depend amen do you have him as a baby or a full matured Holy Spirit expressing his word through you tell me what Jesus do you have yeah right how are you treating him the Jesus that you have how would you treat him in his bride coming how do treat him in the formation of his bride the prophet of God said he did not just resurrect to go to sit on the tomb or to go up in heaven and start playing a harp he resurrected so he can stay on Earth so he can be in you and me so how are you treating him if he's within you if he is in that little door that is so closer to you than than even your arm yeah my arm is here but that door is this is far away who do you have inside there the door there that job was looking looking to speak to to fellowship with who do you have inside there am if it's empty Grace has been given this morning to you if his only comes in and goes out when he's out how are you going to be knocked on his door and find him can you restrain him can you keep him day and night in that door that's closer to you than your arm is closer to you that you can treat him as your husband the prophet of God says in the Look Away to Jesus I wonder how many pilot Pilots will be listening to this how many Pilots would be listening to this now pilot did not accuse him you might not have accused him but pilate has the opportunity of receiving him of having him in his hands he's in your hands this morning how you going to treat him pilate never accused him he was presented to pilate pilate had to make his choice to show his position which side are you on I wonder how many Pilots will be listening to this that your position in some denomination will be too great when we talk about the denomination forget about the churches outside we have it sitting inside here we have a sitting inside of us here our mind is a denomination our thinking a denomination our thought our habits denomination we think our thoughts are so great our our habits are so great what we do is so great that's the greatness of denomination we have instead of accepting the Lord Jesus standing in the position that he is today which position is he standing today not there where he had to suffer to pay the price the ransom for our Redemption that was 2,000 years ago now he sitting in the position of a husband wanting to have a wife or you ready are you committed to him as a wife you know what I'm not let going you let go this is my day as we're driving up with my wife I said sometimes you think you said God is this thought keeps coming let everything I do or I say or I ever think something that I will never regret amen who can build a beautiful house and 40 years down the road he said I regret for spending such much so much money kids have grown up need to I need to sell it that's a little regret but when you did it it was right nothing wrong with that but my desire is God give me that every single decision every single thing I do will never regret um Marth that morning in the East when there is a morning someone is dead women don't even stand outside they don't even sit outside women are inside so Martha walking out to go find Jesus in the town where he has been for days it was an insult to that law a woman could not do that they sit inside on the the rugs they don't stand unless they have maybe go to the back maybe restrooms and come back inside for 40 days so Martha did insult the laws of the Jews but she had never regret and she will never regret that so when she stood up the people murmuring what is she showing she's crazy she's not in her right mind perhaps she could not even explain to them but she would never regret yeah cuz in the very very hours that were following Lazarus came to to life so Martha could not regret that but even after Lazarus passed away do you think Martha could regret we're reading her today yeah amen a decision and you can only make it if Christ sitting in that room not when he's walking up and down or leaving no restrain him inside am and the Roman soldier that helped a nailed him there had punched the sword through his heart then he looked but it was too late sometimes we can wait and it's too late if God has promised to you the baptism of the Holy Ghost today could be that day tomorrow might be too late if you have promised you to walk with him in the newness of Light of Life in his light today could be that day tomorrow might be too late late the next day the Roman soldier was still walking around but it has been too late for him he missed his moment of visitation he had the time in the presence of that Jehovah he looked this is the roman soldier he looked and believed what he looked and believed but it was too late too late for him to believe what he had done had sealed his Doom he had run the spear through the savior's heart it was too late don't run the spear into his heart this morning you might say I'm not I'm not holding a spear the very spirit that is within you the very predisposition that is within you is it a spear or is it an open heart and say God if this is my day let did not pass me by I wonder how many Romans today has done the same thing when we're talking about the Romans about the Roman soldiers forget about those those 2,000 years ago check inside here we have Roman I have Roman soldiers inside of me I have the Romans inside of me and will do the same thing you might look someday but it might be too late I heard in the time time of Noah all those people believed but it was too late this is a time for Faith and the time where faith can no longer be attained let us come back home here Among Us ourselves again again when he was speaking about the history the stories the Bible we go those thousand years back let's just come back inside of us is I was saying if this angel of Malachi 4 let me repeat that if this angel of Malachi 4 is still a prophet to you then you haven't heard the voice which was spoken from heaven it is more than a prophet the prophet of God said in the message called Faith 1955 oh Eternal God you said in your scriptures that when the son of man shall reveal himself from heaven in the last day amen if we you still seeing a prophet you still hear the voice you're hearing just this that's the same voice of the message but through filters of men amen it needs a no filter so once brother Chad is standing here preaching that word the filter you have inside there it has to be from heaven so it catch Tes what is coming here from Heavenly places putting it in your heart but if it goes through another brother say and other men posted this on that that's here right the mind of man right he said I truly believe that you are now revealing yourself from Heaven to the church in Mercy and peace where is he revealing himself from from Heaven am the message if we listen to it we hear it that voice from Earth we doomed that's why we've seen many people presump presumingly for years 30 40 years and then today they said there was never to nothing to it they heard it from here yeah amen and they couldn't help themselves yeah but if it comes from above from heaven and once you hear it from Heaven you will see things from Heaven amen cuz we we read John here let's turn to John 22 I'm revelation 22 I'm lost all over the place cuz once you hear it from heaven automattic ially you see things from Heaven revelation 22 22 verse 8 verse eight says and I John now remember John representing the Bride As the prophet of God says I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen meaning if you hear this message from Heaven automatically you will see things from Heaven you will see things that a neighbor a wife a husband a son a daughter dad mom cannot show you amen John said and I John saw these things and heard them and when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things meaning that when you were hear from heaven and if you see what you're going to be seeing from heaven from Heaven There is a temptation to worship the angel because things are so great brothers and sisters is the grace of God that keeps his bride in possession once you see things from Heaven you will be tempted to worship that angel but the bride won't because the bride can separate amen she has the word Jesus when he walked on the Earth people worshiped him and he never refused it never refused it he never pre prevented them from worshiping him why because both in the body in the spirit or God but the bride will come and say okay the body is my of my brethren yeah but the spirit inside is God Amen amen and nine says then sayith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and thy Brethren the prophet and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God the Brethren what is the Brethren I have the same thing with you guys for the one inside you can worship him because it's the spirit of testimony and he said unto me seal not seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust and he keeps on uh is let him be unjust still and he he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold that angel who was speak still talking and now he's identifying himself with God and behold I come quickly the spirit as we says we say you can know your identity the Jews knew that they were Jews Pilate know that he was not a Jew he was a Roman but did he know his position in the Fulfillment of the prophecy let put them aside you can say you are a Believer I can say I'm a Believer but do I know my position in the Fulfillment of the prophecy just think that an Egyptian could know the promise of God to Abraham could believe that promise of God to Abraham and his seed after him could even bleed his nose on the concrete believing it day and night he would do him nothing why because he's not in the Covenant because he's not in position that's not his position he can even change CH the nationality his citizenship said today I'm becoming a Jew but he's not in the Covenant oh how blessed are we to know that you are called to be Believers and then God has a position for each and every one of us in his body amen right in his kingdom amen the prophet of God says but oh how much more it is to walk when you know where you're walking where you are positioned how much it is to know what you are doing instead of Staggering stumbling along let's just stand up in the light and walk in the light and know know which way you're headed he said you've got to know your position you've got to know your place not only know that you are a Believer not only know that I am a Christian not only know that I'm message believer but to know your position will give you confidence to know your position will give give you authority to know your position will give you peace amen it's something that puts you to rest it's like you can be women's among 10,000 women standing somewhere I can just walk there said honey there's one that just will come up easily there's no scream there's no fasting there's nothing one little short lady will walk up there to me because she knows which position she is in My Little Kingdom so who unveils the identity it's the word Christ who unveils the the position in the body it's the Holy Spirit Christ so once your identity has been unveiled by the word let's listen we're winding down when your identity has been unveiled by the word you must know that you are about to fulfill a prophecy so when you just you have been identified as a Believer just know that since that time your place is waiting for you your spot is empty in this body it needs the prophecy is pending yeah that you will step into that position am to fulfill the prophecy because once you are identified you must be positioned amen right that's the reason once you are baptized by the Holy Ghost it puts you into position from which portion of the vision or a portion of the prophecy you will be fulfilling because God just did not create you to just come here and just be a loose a loose thing or a loose being he had a purpose for sending you here here he had a purpose for waiting and caring for you to come only in this generation and then he ordained his message to come and meet you in this generation Amen to continue his work else you wouldn't be here wouldn't be here you're here because he wanted you to be the shocking point is in all of our lives here for those are are probably more than 40 or 50 years just go back 30 or 40 years ago from 40 years ago and where you are today what have you done zero the place is placed you the if you're married the marriage is placed you in the fellowship he placed you in you had no clue you didn't look for that you didn't work out nothing but you finding yourself in that position meaning he has been leading you you problem couldn't even put anything together it's been leading you step by step you don't know which way why did you have to go this why you have to go this way and you finding up oh I'm finding up in a myself in a position but he wants you now to recognize it cuz once you recognize it the prophecies is easy for you to fulfill Jesus came the prophet of God said Jesus came he knew who he was when he went down there to the grave of Lazarus after the father had showed him a vision told him to leave the house of Lazarus was gone for 4 days they sent for him he didn't go back he knew what was going to happen after the time fulfilled the vision he said friend Lazarus sleepeth I go wake him when he gets to the Grave he said I thank you Father that you have all already heard me sure he was crying when he went to the Grave he was in sympathy with the people but when he got to the Grave there there wasn't a doubt in his mind said father I thank thee because you already heard me Jesus knew who he was and in that time when Lazarus was about to die Jesus could not be there because the prophecy would not be fulfilled it had to be he had to step away as the prophet of God said that if God gives gave me a vision and this this this suit has to be laying there if you take it there the prophecy is hanging yeah the vision is hanging it it would not f it would not work it would not it would stop amen waiting until this is there just think that your life it's waiting until we we might be here all of us yeah it's the prophecy is pending over you and me amen until you're here yeah right amen why he knew where he was standing he was he knew that he was the anointed Christ he knew he had God's word he knew that what God showed him was the truth and that same word and he promised it to you the same word that could identify him as the Son of God this is my beloved Son in which I dwell could identify him like that and position him in such a way that he would be a lamb to be slain to redeem you and me the same word that that placed that that prophesied of him like that is been given to you and me am right amen so Jesus was the son of God but was to stand as a sacrifice in position we man have time to go do that but you will find out that even Adam before the fall Adam knew who his identity was and knew his position amen before the fall I'm just skipping some here because we I take time let's let's let's go to to the Book of Genesis Book of Genesis chapter 2 back again from to the beginning now if you go to Genesis 2: 19 it says and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what God is becoming a detective God is becoming brother Ben Ben seabo investigating God is detecting now said and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof 20 said and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him now when God told Adam Adam you name the animals and the fowls Adam did not go to God and said God I haven't done it before how how how do you do it how can I do it he never questioned God no Adam knew his identity when God created him he said he was created in God's image Adam knew that I'm God's image I'm reflecting everything that God is I'm reflecting right now he had the Revelation the present tense of revelation of who he was he didn't say hey I haven't done this before how how it's done how can I do it no he stood there and whatsoever God was Adam was whatsoever God did Adam did yes and what he did he stood in position he knew that I and my father we are in harmony since we're in harmony I'm not going to move I'm going to just stay in my position he he he break a vision right he didn't Panic he knew that because he wants me to name the animals and his life is within me I'm His Image and I know that he has to he's obligated Hallelujah he's obligated to show me a vision I can do that he stood there and God had to show him like the second Adam Jesus he could do nothing until the father showed him Adam did the same thing waited in Genesis for God to show him and to do that amen because he was given the placing the position to subdue the Earth and he could not subdue the Earth by his own something else since the he was the image reflecting God God was to be subd subduing the Earth through him am he stood stood in his position so when God put him there in Genesis 2 into the Garden of Eden he put him into position and Adam had to stay in his position the prophet of God says this in the message Jehovah Gyra preached in 1961 oh if you could only realize that you men you were made to be an amateur God do you remember the one who could see who knew every n that was on the earth who could see how many times they would bath their eyes now the word of God if you're hearing it from Heaven it's a different but if you're hearing it from here different as well but we want to hear it from Heaven he's saying that if you were made that he said if you could only realize that you men you and me were made to be an amateur of that infinite God you are a son of God that's your identity you are an heir of God that's your placing you are a son but not not a loose son in his kingdom you are an heir that's the position once you know that position Satan can come any time and try to attack you you know in your position that you are an air you will not shake you will not Shake he said yeah you can bring your sickness that's right but you know one one thing I'm in a prophecy if that that sickness was ordained to fulfill my prophecy you bring it on but God will prove to you stay there in your position something might come to us that we don't desire it could be ordaining your prophecy wouldn't you be glad to be standing with that in your prophecy fulfilling it happily and he said you are a son of God you are an heir of God and you have a Dominion Genesis 1:26 he gave him dominion over everything in the earth he made him a God over the Earth that's right he give him a Dominion gave him a Dominion Dominion domain he is a king not him the greatest god a son yeah he is a king a small King he is a God he could speak the trees be changed be pled up and set over there the winds and the waves be still he was a god an amateure God a Son of God like you are a son of your father then listen he said and all the world is groaning waiting to the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for the church to get back in its place again yes brother we're here this message has come not only to identify us as a Believer but to take us back to our position as am as God this message has come to make you and me the ruler in the Book of Revelation might don't have time he said we were made King and Priests we're not called only to be Sons and Daughters of God we called that's our identification our unveiled identity amen but our position our placing is that we are Sons and Daughters of God but we have a domain amen we're Kings and Priests right and as we walk on this Earth with faith our focus should be on that God I am a king I am a priest just remember that slave from Africa a bunch of slaves there eating garlics like everybody like everyone else but they noticed that he was different and until the bio said are you feeding him differently no he eats garlics with everybody else he gets his whips too like everybody else but there was something different about him though he was an alien he knew that back home where he came from he was a son of the king amen and he conducted himself like a son of a king So once you know that you are a king you will walk on this earth like a king right not full of Glory in humility knowing your position amen right a priest that you can intercede for any everybody that's right on Earth amen once your identity has been fully unveiled it places you into your position we don't have time to go the time is sleeping Abraham once God unveiled his identity that you will never be called Abram but but you will be called Abraham something happened in the following verses once God attached his nature his very life to the life of this servant Abraham and said you your name will be called Abraham Abraham knew his position he became immediately an inter intercessor he became immediately A righteous judge who would correct God said would you and when God was about to go back to Sodom and Gomorrah with the other two angels this man who has his name just got changed his identity just got unveiled he said God could you wait a second you don't go let the other Angels Go something is boiling within me because he was always an intered interceder or a righteous judge he knew his position right away he said and God said oh you know what I cannot hide anything from you Amos 47 you are a prophet my son I cannot hide anything from you I have to reveal it to you you are a prophet I'm obligated I'm going there to Sodom and gomorra to burn it and Abraham started interceding interceding said God would do that onto a righteous judge this is a man who was a few years ago an idol worshippers but his identity has been so much unveiled in such power that it placed him right away as a righteous judge who can correct God he didn't correct God it was God in Abraham continuing his work in such a way he said even if you find 10 he knew God Ruth is inside there Ruth is in lot there if you kill lot there's no Ruth There's No Redemption I have boas but Ruth is there right we have been called to be rulers Governors if there was a school of Governors I would start going to that school because that's what I have been called to be if there was a a school for rulers of the Earth how to rule the Earth how to govern the earth I would go to that school but we have it already the message has come to give at that school am has given us the Holy Spirit and Liberty how how to how to live amen Our Lives they've been putting cameras in every room every place in the offices we don't need that you might not have any camera around I've been exposed to Heaven my life is exposed wherever I am am know how you Worship in your your your shower nothing on worshiping God cuz the heaven is open to you said God here I am I'm empty as I can be but some something inside deep inside of me that's attached to you amen we have that's too many things I have to skip them brother BR says that there two two classes of people you remember that one is fundamentalist and one Pentecost but when he's speaking he will always tell you that he would said the the F fundamentalist positionally positionally they know the position but one thing they're lacking they're not identified God has not identified them within them supp positionally knows where they stand but they have never received the Holy Ghost to be identified for your identity to be unveiled you must receive the Holy Ghost else we will be presuming and with presumption you will never get recognize your place you must it is you know what it it has to be a cry within you never be satisfied by anything less than that I remember Rachel the wife to to to to to Jacob she couldn't give birth when Leah was giving birth and the servants giving birth her servant giving birth she came to a spot she looked at Jacob in face he said if you don't give me a child I'm dying has to come at such level for every Christian every son and every daughter of God said you know what I don't want to pretend if you don't give me the Holy Ghost I'm going to die yes such a serious matter once you come to that level even your service will change coming to church will have a different [Music] meaning fundamentalists positionally know where they stand but they have never received the Holy Ghost so they haven't got any faith of what they know that's right and the Pentecostal has received the Holy Ghost but don't positionally know who they are is the prophet of God said put them together it's like somebody knows how to write a check and someone doesn't have the money someone knows how to write a check without money in the account and someone has a a money in his bank account and not knowing how to write check put them together something will happen but the prophet of God comes to this that's lesson that's where I coming to he doesn't mention the fundamentalist in this because fundamentalists they are lacking something they're lacking the Holy Spirit they have not received the Holy Spirit once you have not received the Holy Spirit the door is still closed so he's not talking about those he's talking about the Pentecostal which have already received the word the Holy Ghost then there's a room to move to go further amen just think that all the blessings all the position the placing that God wants to you to be inher uh air to that or inheriting the only door that can be opened is once you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost not the mockery one the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life the word will take on a different meaning you will have that responsibility in your neighborhood wherever you are you not the god what do you want me to do at this place people are walking in doing this maybe a gas station Lord do you have anybody I can pray for that young man is struggling there father I don't know maybe his family maybe his relative Lord is is there any Grace on him father would you do something as even I walk there even if he cannot understand maybe he might be out of his mind father this is the age of our shadows should be counted in your Shadow should be counting that God I do not know what you would do with my shadow my life has to be so open so dedicated so Sanctified that whatever you want to do with it you do it he said if Pentecost Pentecostal people could only realize not the fundamentalist fundamentalists they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but once you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost God is accounting you as a Pentecostal because you have an experience of the Pentecost now with that experience he wants you to realize your position he said if Pentecostal people could only realize that they are not the scum of the Earth but they are Sons and Daughters identified first of God hes of all things through Christ you are an heir once you step into that door of the the true not the mockery Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost just look up said I'm an heir none of tiny things an heir of all things you might be you might be the righteous judge in your city said God I don't know how many messy Believers are here in this area when you look at this city where would your eyes go let my home be where your eyes could rest let my heart be where your eyes could rest let my thoughts be where your eyes could rest Let My Words everything where my your your your eyes could rest and he says but as long as Satan can keep you afraid to claim your inheritance then he's got you as long as you are afraid don't be afraid of any word that that God wrote for just hang your faith on any punctuation yes sir that's in the that's that's in there because it's right it's exactly right so knowing your position once you have been identified by the word of your day once it's been revealed to you you can recognize who you are in this great body of the Lord Jesus Christ CH let's read uh in the message the believer's position in Christ 1955 the prophet of God said we have got to do what God has revealed to us he has to reveal once we are born into that Kingdom we're born of him he is in the obligation to reveal to us what our position is how do I know it it's your kingdom you you birth me into it where is my position what would you want me to do Paul asked the same thing what would you want me to do now as you converted me as you met me what do you want me to do now brother brother Graham is doing that God has revealed to him a a worldwide Revival and he's making a good show of it too I appreciate him and I'm trying my best by the Revelation that God has given me to minister to the sick people to what he told me to do so God had told the prophet to do he put him in position go pray for the sick and do this he was positioned because he had an experience without that true experience there's no position to be known you're going to be just a floater now if we can find our position is the prophet saying it and know what it's God word and know that it's God's word that has promised proed it that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear that they could take the promised land because not only they had that experience but they knew their position in that Kingdom the prophet of God says this winding down in the message why we are what we are and don't let us not hear it from Earth let's hear it from heaven we are what we are and that's one thing that has hurt our Pentecostal move and other moves it is somebody trying to be something that they are not do let's not do that they are trying to impersonate someone one else you can't do that you're just what you are that's all and when you do that God will use you in just what you are don't say I have to become this I have to be this God will use you just the way you are and you are just as important as anybody else I love that that equality of Sons and Daughters of God you are just as important once you birth into that Kingdom you are just as important as anybody else in that Kingdom as I said the other night the little bitty hairspring in this watch is just as important as the main spring cuz it takes it all together to make time when we realize our position in Christ and then abide in that position it's just a little housewi if it's just a little housewife just stay there don't pretend don't expect to be something big in that position if it's just a little housewife stay right there that's what God wants you to do see just be who you are you don't have to turn Ephesians 1 1 Paul mention just in one sentence Paul an apostle of Jesus Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints he identified to whom he was speaking which are at e Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ not only he was talking to those he identified them and he placed them in Christ amen your I unveiled true unveiled identity will position you in the body of Christ am with no doubt amen it's something he has once you birth into that Kingdom he sealed you with his holy spirit he has the obligation to place you amen that you can know your position in in the body so brother BR picks it picked it up in uh the message believer's position he said Paul wasn't preaching here to the unsaved he was preaching ing it to the saved the called out the separated the set aside and the faithful in the core now that's who he addresses it to the believer's position is in Christ you will never have the greatest position you will ever have in in life it's in Christ amen and for you to have it you must be born again again you must be filled with his holy ghost as we heard it last Sunday then you are a witness into that body you will witness that I am a toe you will witness that I am a hand you will witness that I'm a navor you will witness I'm a hair in that body and Christ will only meet the believer not the unbelievers and the believer can only worship Christ as is positionally placed in Christ that is that is critical amen how would God receive your worship when you are born again the believer let's listen to that as we're winding [Music] down the believer can only worship Christ just think how you as a Believer I am a believer how can we worship Christ as he is positionally placed in Christ amen outside of your position there's no worship outside the your your position there's no worship cuz you might be too high up Jesus sitting here you up there how are you going to worship Him looking down to him but at his feet if he's sitting you have an opportunity and more room to worship Him by being down looking up to him and he said no man has no right to Worship the Lord outside of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ did we hear that yeah let me read it again no man this man means a woman children grownup elderly everybody included no man has no right there's no right for that man to Worship the Lord outside of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ right now how do we enter into that body by a new birth amen by the Holy Ghost once you are sealed in the kingdom of God with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you become a candidate to worship because you can only worship Him in your position in your land amen children of Israel when they went back to their Homeland every Ephraim has to be in his land Amen manasse in his land everyone that's from there you can worship outside of your land there's no worship amen and we desire to worship him if we're burn born again then we find the channel for us to worship him and then let me read this one there was a question asked brother brandham as musicians I don't know if you can start coming the time is slipping by a question and question answered how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ I would I want to know that everybody here would like to know that right how does one one know their rightful position in the body of Christ because only in this position your worship could be received outside of this position we're just singing we're just talking we just pleasing our lips pleasing our neighbors pleasing the pastor and the Believers it's only in this position my given position that I can truly worship that God could receive my worship outside of that we have no right that's a good one very good that's the prophet that would be the kind of question amongst many of us here tonight how do you rightfully know now I'm presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play a good question that any sensible any believer would ask and glad that somebody asked it on my behalf and on your behalf too and the prophet of God goes now for instance I would say like this brother to give you the best answer I know your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Ghost you see why we need the holy ghost from him not the Holy Ghost made by man or somebody told me I have it or maybe I had the Shivering something happened I give to myself okay you gave yourself but which position he placed you in yeah what did he tell you about your position because the prophet said your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Ghost yes and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you are doing or not am but watch out cuz sometimes we can take our fortive world and be blessed we won't go further with that it will crack somewhere yeah right 30 years it doesn't care it will crack 40 years it will crack yeah amen let him do that and the prophet of God says in the future home winding down and if you are the bride the Bride is a part of the husband and the only place that you will ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband that word you are or you can't recognize being the bright how many see that see you have to recognize your position I play something soft I've got to stop would you stand up brothers and sisters I was just thinking as you Ponder on this let it be something that speaking to you not from this beaten up man but hear these words I cannot even put together in vocabulary hear it from Heaven if you hear it from Heaven you will see things that no one beside you can show you cuz you know what is inside of that door you know who is sitting inside there whether it's somebody's sitting there or it's empty but it will never be empty because Pride could be sitting there arrogancy could be sitting [Music] there big plans could be sitting there big projects but how far would they go the only thing as the prophet of God says anything that will come back into the resurrection is something that had a purpose from God if that big project big plan big thought of you is not in the purpose of God it's a wasting of time it's empty just think about [Music] Moses he was the youngest of the family but by Sovereign Grace he was made a God to Pharaoh so coming to religious matters Miriam older sister Aaron older brother they were looking up to their youngest brother because he was the be God to Egypt they had to take heed to his words but when they have family gathering Moses has no word to say he has to look up at Aaron and Miriam what are you saying there's always a paradox God my has chosen to speak to you this morning you know where you are and you know who is inside of your heart I might be here like a little Moses not comparing us to but there's a little big God here at this place holy place that uh has chosen to reveal and unveil himself to us here why won't you take this opportunity as we bow our heads we close our eyes just don't rush to go home would you would you speak to him would you just knowing that God you will never receive my worship if I do not have that Holy Ghost if I am not in my ordained position placed in my position could I be wasting time thinking presuming that I'm worshiping you when nothing is being received on your [Music] end could I be going with so much effort knowing that it's just empty Lord one word from you one experience from you will place me me into your worship when if the Holy Ghost will baptize me and bring your presence your life into my heart I know which door I can knock on every day and every morning Lord just pray him in your own way and just said God if this is that time for me I don't want this to slip by I'm forgetting about the one who's sitting close to me I'm forgetting about the one who's sitting in front of me on my back I'm forgetting Lord this is a serious matter because I want to worship you you created me to worship you but I realize that worship has a condition I cannot meet that condition on my own it would take you to make me meet that condition father as I desire to worship you you are obligated to give me this life why don't you cry out of out to him for this life in your own way say Lord I want to meet the requirement because once I am in that body I can find my true place and my fellowship with you remember he wants to fellowship with you more than you we would but he wants it to be in his body and there is a requirement for that [Music] positioned by the unveiled identity which identity has this message given to you which identity has this word revealed to you which position are you in right now after it has been revealed to you when Abraham Abram's identity was revealed right away he went into action when Mary that identity was revealed to her that you are the mother of the Lord she went into action she didn't not wait for days or hide for the Neighbors she went to action which action by the way brought back John the Baptist to life she recognized her position Lord this morning or this afternoon with my hand lifted up myself and my brothers lifted up we would want you to come and place us into a true worship to place us into this body where we can hear from heaven and see things from heaven and father walk on this Earth with all humility as sons of the most high Kings and and Priests Lord you you are so wonderful bless your children now father as Lord you have spoken what you have placed in our little hearts and notes Here Lord but you be the doorer and let father your word never go empty that it will bring what you ordained them to bring into full maturity we humbly submit ourselves to you and ask that you will you will be that friend that will never leave [Music] us have your way Lord again we bring brother Chad and brother Ron brother Ben brother Gabe and all those that are away and different ministers across the globe and all those that have recognized their position receive their worship wherever they are worship at the pulpit Worship in the pews worship at work wherever they are reveal yourself Lord we love you we commit all things to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen have a little song there brother amen I'm resting on the finished word Jesus Christ Christ today all circumstances will be gone and the word of God will still remain no sickness fear no guilt or sin can have control or worry the keys of Faith are in my hands I am Bound for for victory I am free my new day has come now I can who I truly am I am free covered
