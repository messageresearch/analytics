[7:16] amen god bless you this morning let's
[7:18] bow our heads and pray together
[7:21] lord jesus we thank you father
[7:23] for the privilege of once again
[7:25] gathering lord and we thank you that
[7:26] you've been so good to us
[7:28] to watch over us and take care of us and
[7:30] protect us
[7:31] and bring us back to this time of
[7:33] fellowship again where we can bind
[7:35] ourselves together
[7:36] to worship you in spirit and in truth
[7:39] and to hear your word
[7:41] i pray god as we come to this time in
[7:43] the service where we open and lord your
[7:45] word and we read from it
[7:47] god we're asking that you would do the
[7:49] supernatural part lord we can turn pages
[7:52] and we could read
[7:53] but god we need you to come and bring
[7:55] divine revelation upon your word we need
[7:58] you to give us the eye sabb to see and
[8:00] give us ears to hear
[8:02] may we have a heart to receive and
[8:03] perceive all that you have for us lord
[8:06] may this word become flesh in our lives
[8:08] for that is the manifestation of this
[8:10] hour
[8:11] god i pray you would have your way take
[8:13] preeminence among us and find welcome
[8:15] among us
[8:16] may we receive you lord in jesus
[8:19] christ's name we pray
[8:21] amen
[8:22] god bless you while you're standing if
[8:24] we could take our bibles and turn to the
[8:26] book of galatian chapter 4
[8:30] amen
[8:32] and welcome back brother john kadeem
[8:34] it's good to have you back he was gone
[8:36] last sunday preaching over in
[8:37] pennsylvania so
[8:39] i'm glad you're here brother
[8:41] amen also want to remind you there's
[8:42] communion service this afternoon so
[8:44] we'll make an announcement about that at
[8:46] the end of service again but today will
[8:48] be our communion service
[8:50] amen let's read galatians chapter 4
[8:55] verse 28
[8:59] now we brethren as isaac was
[9:02] are the children of promise
[9:04] that's all i want to read you can have
[9:06] your seeds amen god bless you
[9:09] we now we brethren as isaac was
[9:12] are the children of promise
[9:14] what a wonderful scripture amen
[9:18] if we can catch the full reality of that
[9:20] this morning i'd like to minister on a
[9:22] subject called the seat of promise
[9:24] and and what i'd like to do is take some
[9:26] time and i'm going to force myself i've
[9:28] talked myself into going slow and i hope
[9:31] that i can
[9:32] keep myself talked into going slow and i
[9:34] want to go through several scriptures
[9:36] because there's so many things that we
[9:38] talk about that the prophet of god
[9:39] brought to us in understanding and so
[9:41] much terminology we use in quotes that
[9:44] we use amen it's become such second
[9:46] nature to us it is something that's so
[9:48] commonly understood among us but we
[9:50] don't realize how foreign that is or
[9:52] maybe we've forgotten how foreign it is
[9:54] to the rest of the world
[9:55] to everybody else in the denominational
[9:57] understanding these concepts are so far
[10:00] removed and so foreign amen but we want
[10:03] to just by the grace of god look into
[10:05] the scripture and see what a solid
[10:07] foundation brother branham has for
[10:08] making the comments that he has and i
[10:10] want to go back and take my time and go
[10:12] through that because there's some things
[10:13] that i really in my heart want to get to
[10:15] and i don't know if i'll do it today or
[10:17] wednesday or next sunday but there's a
[10:19] certain direction that i the lord has me
[10:21] going in and i want to lay this solid
[10:24] foundation and realize that for some
[10:26] this will be review but always in review
[10:28] they're always digging up new gold
[10:30] nuggets amen and we always have new ones
[10:33] coming up and youth coming up to a
[10:34] greater level of understanding and new
[10:36] ones that have come in and visitors so i
[10:39] want to take my time this morning and
[10:41] maybe like a bible study and
[10:43] i've said that before and end up
[10:45] preaching
[10:46] and i thought i'll come out and preach
[10:47] and do a bible study so i really can't
[10:49] predict anything i just got some things
[10:50] in my heart i want to share
[10:52] so
[10:53] god bless you however you pull is
[10:55] probably what we'll get amen
[10:57] but praise god
[10:59] i want to look at this seed of promise
[11:00] and what paul says here is
[11:02] out it's outstanding it's a it's an
[11:04] outstanding statement if god could give
[11:07] us the revelation of what this really
[11:08] means and what all's included in this so
[11:11] now we brethren as isaac was are the
[11:13] children of promise that means we are
[11:16] the children of promise amen and so when
[11:19] god
[11:20] was speaking to abraham he was giving
[11:22] abraham a promise that he was going to
[11:24] have a seed amen and we know we're going
[11:26] to get into this in the scriptures that
[11:28] that seed was speaking of christ amen
[11:30] and now paul and and the promises the
[11:33] blessings and the promises that are
[11:34] given to abraham also apply to abraham's
[11:38] seed
[11:39] and so what god speaks to abraham in the
[11:42] way of a promise and in the way of a
[11:45] blessing amen that promise and that
[11:47] blessing passes right onto the seed so
[11:50] now when he says
[11:52] we brethren as isaac was are the
[11:54] children of promise now what he's doing
[11:56] is he's linking us all the way back to
[12:00] abraham abraham standing in the presence
[12:03] of god and god giving promises and
[12:05] blessings to abraham and now those
[12:08] promises and blessings to abraham apply
[12:11] to abraham's seed and now paul comes in
[12:13] the new testament and say we like isaac
[12:15] are the children of promise and now you
[12:17] can say all that was given to abraham
[12:19] all that was promised to abraham and all
[12:21] the blessing on abraham is mine too
[12:25] see it it is it is it's fundamental amen
[12:28] that we can understand this and it's
[12:31] it's interesting how the apostle paul
[12:33] can come along and he can pull this out
[12:35] of the old testament because it seems so
[12:38] uh
[12:38] if you were alive in the day of the
[12:40] apostle paul and you were raised in the
[12:42] jewish tradition of understanding your
[12:44] bible when the apostle paul begins to
[12:46] preach in the book of romans in the book
[12:48] of galatians amen there you there's no
[12:51] way amen that you with a traditional
[12:53] understanding and no seed of god there's
[12:55] no way you could accept what paul's
[12:57] preaching
[12:59] and i'm going to get into that and read
[13:01] the scriptures and start to show that
[13:02] paul was absolutely revolutionary in the
[13:05] way that he took the old testament and
[13:07] brought it into the present day
[13:10] and it was so
[13:12] contrary to carnal understanding so
[13:14] contrary to any reasonable thought
[13:18] there's no way that he could go read
[13:21] that amen and pull it in and apply it
[13:23] the way he does unless god himself gave
[13:26] him the revelation of that word
[13:30] let's go to romans 4 and begin to look
[13:32] at that i've got some long scripture
[13:33] readings and i hope long scripture
[13:35] readings don't bore you
[13:36] but they excite me
[13:38] it just
[13:39] amen it just takes eyes to see and it
[13:41] takes a word of
[13:42] revelation
[13:44] to see what god has written here and
[13:46] then it becomes so exciting
[13:51] uh romans
[13:53] romans chapter four
[13:57] and we'll start at verse one
[14:00] what shall we say then that abraham our
[14:02] father is pertaining to the flesh hath
[14:04] found
[14:05] for if abraham were justified by works
[14:07] he hath aware of to glory but not before
[14:10] god
[14:11] for what saith the scripture abraham
[14:13] believed god and it was counted unto him
[14:17] for righteousness
[14:19] that word counted is the same word
[14:21] that's interpreted imputed later
[14:24] so
[14:25] the word to impute or to count means to
[14:29] account somebody as having or lay it to
[14:31] their account or to to recognize it as
[14:35] uh in their account or accounted to them
[14:37] or this is where they're at okay
[14:39] so for for what say the scriptures
[14:42] abraham believed god and it was counted
[14:44] unto him for righteousness so it was in
[14:46] his account it was reckoned it was
[14:48] imputed it was it was reason that that
[14:51] he was righteous
[14:54] why because he could believe god
[14:57] amen and i love the way it's written for
[15:00] what saith the scriptures abraham
[15:02] believed god it did not say he believed
[15:04] in god because in abraham's day
[15:06] everybody believed in god
[15:10] amen
[15:11] so
[15:12] it wasn't that he believed in god but
[15:14] that wasn't counted to him for
[15:16] righteousness even more than believing
[15:18] in god is accounted today for
[15:21] righteousness because there's there's
[15:23] like i said millions billions of people
[15:25] who believe in god but how many people
[15:27] believe god
[15:31] amen to believe god a minister receive
[15:34] his word amen to receive his word is to
[15:36] receive the word that applies to your
[15:38] day that is to believe god
[15:41] for what say the scriptures abraham
[15:43] believed god and it was counted unto him
[15:45] for righteousness
[15:46] now to him that worketh is the reward
[15:48] not reckoned of grace but of debt so
[15:51] he's going back to the law and he's
[15:53] talking to a people that are breaking
[15:54] free from the law and coming into into
[15:57] grace and he's saying what let's look at
[15:59] abraham and he says now abraham when he
[16:02] believed god it was counted unto him for
[16:04] righteousness it wasn't based off his
[16:06] works because if it was just that he got
[16:08] the deeds right amen then god would owe
[16:11] him
[16:14] but it was by grace not of debt god
[16:16] didn't owe abraham anything god gave by
[16:20] grace to abraham his favor
[16:25] amen because why because abraham had the
[16:28] ability to believe god
[16:30] and when he expressed the ability to
[16:32] believe god he showed that he was
[16:34] already in grace
[16:38] so
[16:39] because
[16:40] if it was reckoned not of grace but of
[16:43] debt
[16:44] then if you could do everything right
[16:46] which the law proved no man could do
[16:48] everything right but if you could
[16:50] somehow do everything right then god
[16:51] would owe you something but god owes no
[16:54] man anything
[16:57] verse 5 but to him that worketh not but
[17:00] believeth on him that justifieth the
[17:02] ungodly his faith is counted for
[17:05] righteousness
[17:07] even as david also described the
[17:09] blessedness of the man unto whom god
[17:10] imputed righteousness without works
[17:13] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[17:16] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[17:18] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[17:21] not impute sin now listen
[17:24] this is interesting the way he says that
[17:25] because if you go back to verse 6 it
[17:27] says even as david also described the
[17:29] blessedness of the man unto whom god
[17:31] imputeth righteousness without works and
[17:34] and when you go back you can't find
[17:37] david saying that god imputed
[17:39] righteousness without works but what he
[17:41] does say is blessed is the man who god
[17:43] will not impute
[17:45] because we were all born sinners amen
[17:47] we're all born wrong amen we're all born
[17:50] in this in this world of hybridization
[17:53] thinking wrong believing wrong but god
[17:55] there are some that god will not impute
[17:57] their sin amen if he will not impute sin
[17:59] unto you it's the same as imputing
[18:01] righteousness unto you
[18:06] blessed is the man whom the lord will
[18:08] not impute sin come with this
[18:09] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[18:11] only now when he says circumcision or
[18:14] uncircumcision he's talking jew and
[18:16] gentile these are generic terms for jew
[18:18] and gentile
[18:19] so this blessedness then cometh the
[18:21] circumcision only or upon the
[18:23] uncircumcision also
[18:25] for we say that faith was reckoned to
[18:27] abraham for righteousness
[18:29] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[18:31] circumcision or in uncircumcision not in
[18:34] circumcision but in uncircumcision
[18:37] so he believed god before he received
[18:40] the the commandment for circumcision so
[18:42] when he was yet uncircumcised and
[18:44] remember abraham was chosen by god and
[18:47] abraham there was no jews as of yet that
[18:50] term jew came later to the family of
[18:53] abraham after
[18:54] abraham so this abraham was just
[18:59] like everybody else he was in the same
[19:00] mix of humanity as every other person
[19:03] was in the mix of humanity amen it was
[19:05] not yet divided into jew or gentile
[19:07] everybody was just mankind and in this
[19:10] mankind amen god comes down and by his
[19:14] own sovereignty he selects one man
[19:18] now remember amen we by faith amen are
[19:21] seed of abraham amen so what what god
[19:24] does with abraham he does with the seed
[19:26] and what god promises to abraham he
[19:28] promises to the seed so now when god is
[19:30] going to come down and call abraham amen
[19:33] in in the commonality of mankind he goes
[19:35] and finds one amen not because he was
[19:38] better not because of his works not
[19:41] because anything that abraham had done
[19:43] amen brother benham said his daddy was
[19:46] an idol maker
[19:48] he come his daddy brought him down amen
[19:51] from the into uh amen from babylon amen
[19:55] when god broke up babel the tower of
[19:57] babel amen his daddy come down from that
[19:59] and brought brought abraham down from
[20:01] that so he was stuck in that idolatry
[20:03] and that false religion of the day of
[20:05] the thing that god had to come down and
[20:07] destroy
[20:09] so abraham and his family was caught up
[20:11] in this
[20:13] and so god did not select abraham by any
[20:17] of abraham's merit he selected abraham
[20:20] by his own predestinated determined
[20:23] counsel
[20:26] and so he chose one man amen we're going
[20:30] to spend a lot of time talking about
[20:31] abraham because paul tells us that we
[20:34] are the children of promise
[20:37] he's going to tell us that we're
[20:38] abraham's children
[20:40] and so then this is the start
[20:44] of the family i would say of abraham not
[20:47] carnal but abraham spiritual
[20:51] so there's a carnal family of abraham
[20:53] and remember you can't just look at the
[20:55] family of abraham and say the seed of
[20:57] abraham children of abraham because
[20:59] really in the seed of abraham and
[21:02] carnally you've got isaac in his lineage
[21:04] but you also have ishmael in his lineage
[21:07] and you also have other sons that were
[21:08] born to him to a second wife
[21:11] and they are a car carnal natural seed
[21:14] of abraham that's why the natural
[21:16] lineage will not work there must be a
[21:18] spiritual lineage coming down a lineage
[21:21] of faith a spiritual line coming from
[21:24] abraham that all of these promises apply
[21:26] to
[21:29] amen
[21:31] now that does not mean i'm not not in
[21:34] any way saying that there's not still an
[21:36] application for the seed through isaac
[21:38] through the natural seed of abraham
[21:40] through isaac and that lineage which
[21:41] became the jews amen which were the
[21:43] chosen people of god there's still a
[21:45] blessing there there's still work there
[21:47] there's still promises that god has
[21:49] applied there but i'm taking what paul
[21:51] did taking the spiritual side and the
[21:54] spiritual lineage
[21:56] and it goes on to say
[22:00] um
[22:03] verse 10
[22:05] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[22:07] circumcision and uncircumcision not in
[22:09] circumcision but in uncircumcision so
[22:12] god calls a common man by his own uh
[22:15] foreknowledge he calls him by his own
[22:17] choosing and this man
[22:19] he has the capacity to believe god
[22:22] but in his capacity to believe god amen
[22:25] he does not yet have the capacity to
[22:27] fully obey god
[22:30] because he only partially obeyed he was
[22:32] told to leave his family leave his land
[22:34] and go to a land where he told him but
[22:35] he didn't leave you know he went with
[22:37] his father up to haran and took lot and
[22:40] then when his father passed away then he
[22:41] went over to the land and he took lot he
[22:44] was supposed to separate from his family
[22:46] so he had the capacity to believe god
[22:48] even yet he was not fully obedient
[22:52] but his faith was counted to him for
[22:55] righteousness not his works
[22:59] praise be to god now we know abraham
[23:02] will grow into perfect obedience
[23:05] but god had already imputed
[23:07] righteousness unto him before he had
[23:08] grown into full obedience
[23:10] as abraham matures in his walk with god
[23:13] he grows into full obedience and gives
[23:15] god preeminence
[23:18] but god had already imputed
[23:19] righteousness unto him and already
[23:20] sealed it with a sign of circumcision
[23:22] before he had grown into perfect
[23:23] obedience
[23:28] oh i'm telling you it's good to be in
[23:29] this lineage
[23:31] this is the right family tree amen
[23:36] so not in circumcision but in
[23:38] uncircumcision and he received the sign
[23:40] of circumcision a seal of the
[23:42] righteousness of the faith which he had
[23:44] yet being uncircumcised that he might be
[23:47] the father of all them that believe
[23:50] though they be not circumcised that
[23:52] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[23:55] also
[23:56] so abraham
[23:58] he he
[24:00] he received the truth and righteousness
[24:03] was imputed unto him
[24:05] amen before he received the seal of
[24:07] circumcision so that he could be the
[24:09] father of all that believe
[24:14] so if you can believe god
[24:16] abraham is your father
[24:20] if you just believe in god the demons do
[24:22] that also
[24:26] amen
[24:28] all right let's keep going verse 12 and
[24:30] the father of circumcision the father
[24:33] the jews
[24:34] to them who are not who who are not of
[24:36] the circumcision only
[24:39] but who also walk in the steps of that
[24:42] faith of our father abraham which he had
[24:44] being yet uncircumcised
[24:46] and what he's saying here he is the
[24:48] father of all he's the father of on the
[24:49] uncircumcised who can believe he's also
[24:52] the father of the circumcised who can go
[24:54] on in faith and believe
[24:57] who are not just stuck in circumcision
[24:58] only but can move on with faith
[25:01] so he's the father of faith whether
[25:03] circumcised or uncircumcised whether jew
[25:05] or gentile he's the father of faith
[25:10] for the promise that he should be the
[25:12] heir of the world was not to abraham or
[25:15] to his seed through the law but through
[25:17] the righteousness of faith verse 13
[25:21] i am included in verse 13.
[25:25] for the promise that he should be heir
[25:28] of the
[25:30] world
[25:33] was not to abraham or to his seed
[25:37] through the law but through the
[25:38] righteousness of
[25:40] faith so that means i am part of
[25:43] abraham's seed by faith not by law not
[25:46] by works but by faith i'm part of that
[25:48] seed if i'm part of the seed then i am
[25:50] heir of the world amen that's why i have
[25:53] a right to sit on the throne with christ
[25:55] amen and be a amen be in joint rulership
[25:58] with him through the millennium be a
[26:00] joint heir with christ why because i am
[26:03] of the seed of abraham amen by faith
[26:05] amen in righteousness through faith and
[26:08] praise god this promise is to me
[26:14] for the promise that he should be the
[26:16] heir of the world was not to abraham but
[26:18] to his seed through the law but through
[26:19] the righteousness of faith for if they
[26:21] which are of the law be heirs faith is
[26:24] made void and the promise made of
[26:26] non-effect
[26:27] because the law worketh wrath for theirs
[26:29] whereas no law is there is no
[26:30] transgression
[26:32] therefore it is of faith that it might
[26:34] be by grace to the end the promise might
[26:37] be sure to all the seed not to that only
[26:40] which is of the law but to that also
[26:42] which is of the faith of abraham who is
[26:44] the father of us all
[26:48] as it is written i have made thee a
[26:50] father of many nations before him whom
[26:52] he believed even god who quickened the
[26:54] dead and called those things which be
[26:57] not as though they were
[26:59] who against hope believed in hope that
[27:01] he might become the father of many
[27:03] nations according to that which was
[27:05] spoken so
[27:07] so shall thy seed be
[27:10] so so shall thy seed be it'll be coming
[27:13] through many nations but it's not a
[27:15] natural lineage it's a spiritual lineage
[27:18] it's a lineage of faith
[27:20] and being not weak in faith he
[27:22] considered not his own body now dead
[27:24] when he was about a hundred years old
[27:26] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[27:28] he staggered not at the promise of god
[27:30] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[27:33] giving glory to god
[27:34] and being fully persuaded that what he
[27:36] had promised he was able to perform
[27:39] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[27:41] righteousness now it was not written for
[27:43] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[27:45] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[27:48] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[27:51] up jesus our lord from the dead who was
[27:53] delivered for our offenses and was
[27:55] raised again for our justification
[27:58] so praise god revelation or romans
[28:01] chapter 4 is telling us if you can
[28:03] believe like abraham believed that you
[28:06] can you can have the promise that
[28:07] abraham had amen you can have the
[28:09] imputation of righteousness you can
[28:11] become heir to the world
[28:13] the blessing and the promise if you can
[28:16] have the faith that abraham had then
[28:18] abraham is your father and you're one of
[28:20] the children of abraham by faith you're
[28:22] part of that lineage of abraham and the
[28:25] the promise was to the seed and you're
[28:27] part of that seed and now you're part of
[28:29] every promise that was to abraham
[28:32] if you can believe
[28:34] the way abraham believed
[28:38] let's go to john chapter 8.
[28:57] let's go to 8 31.
[29:04] then said jesus to those jews which
[29:06] believed on him
[29:08] if you continue in my word
[29:10] then are you my disciples indeed
[29:12] and you shall know the truth and the
[29:14] truth shall make you free
[29:16] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[29:18] and we're never in bondage to any man
[29:20] how sayest thou you shall be made free
[29:23] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[29:25] unto you whosoever committeth sin is the
[29:27] servant of sin
[29:29] and the servant abideth not in the house
[29:31] forever but the son abideth ever
[29:34] if the son therefore shall make you free
[29:36] you shall be free indeed
[29:38] i know that you're abraham's seed but
[29:40] you seek to kill me because my word hath
[29:42] no place in you
[29:44] i speak that which i have seen with my
[29:46] father and you do that which you have
[29:47] seen with your father
[29:49] they answered and said unto him abraham
[29:51] is our father jesus saith unto them if
[29:54] you were abraham's children you would do
[29:56] the works of abraham
[29:58] now jesus is having a conversation here
[30:00] with the jews amen and and they're
[30:03] claiming abraham as their father and and
[30:06] jesus says
[30:08] i know that you are abraham's seed jesus
[30:11] is speaking naturally
[30:13] i know that you're abraham's seed but if
[30:16] abraham were your father
[30:18] [Laughter]
[30:20] amen what a confusing conversation amen
[30:24] i know that you're abraham's seed but if
[30:26] abraham were your father amen praise be
[30:28] to god i know that you're naturally that
[30:31] you can trace your lineage back to
[30:33] abraham i understand that that you're a
[30:35] natural seed of abraham amen but you
[30:37] seek to kill me this did not abraham do
[30:40] amen it's because my word has no place
[30:42] in you so abraham is not your father
[30:48] amen
[30:50] see
[30:51] when
[30:52] when they can no longer go on in faith
[30:55] they become a natural seed of abraham
[30:57] amen and like i said there was other
[30:59] natural seeds of abraham
[31:02] but what what was important to retain
[31:05] retain the promise amen was to stay the
[31:07] faith seed of abraham
[31:11] yeah i said i speak that which i've seen
[31:12] in my father you do that which you have
[31:14] seen with your father and they answered
[31:16] and said unto him abraham is our father
[31:18] jesus saith unto him if you were
[31:20] abraham's children you would do the
[31:22] works of abraham
[31:24] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[31:26] had told you the truth which i have
[31:28] heard of god
[31:29] this did not abraham and then why didn't
[31:32] abraham do that you have to think he's
[31:34] not saying amen you're seeking to kill
[31:36] me abraham didn't kill people because
[31:38] abraham did kill people
[31:41] when he delivered lot
[31:44] he's not saying because of because
[31:47] you're going to fight me because you're
[31:48] going to kill me you're not abraham's
[31:50] seed he goes i have told you the truth
[31:53] amen
[31:54] and i have told you the truth abraham
[31:56] didn't do this because abraham believed
[31:59] god
[32:01] so now he's saying but now you seek to
[32:02] kill me amen that have told you the
[32:04] truth which i have heard of god this did
[32:06] not abraham basically jesus said i am
[32:09] telling you the truth from god abraham
[32:11] would never reject this amen because
[32:13] abraham believed god and when abraham
[32:15] believed it was imputed unto him for
[32:17] righteousness and if abraham you were
[32:18] your father you would receive me amen
[32:20] because i come with the word of god i am
[32:22] the word of god and abraham would never
[32:25] reject the word of god in his day
[32:28] so now they have no imputation of
[32:30] righteousness amen they have put
[32:32] themselves out from under that blessing
[32:34] because they are rejecting the word of
[32:36] god
[32:38] and jesus can clearly identify that
[32:40] abraham is not your father amen so he
[32:43] could identify the lineage not by
[32:46] physical characteristics but by
[32:48] spiritual response to the word
[32:54] the way they responded to the word and
[32:56] listen
[32:57] these were these were men and men and
[32:59] women who were responding to the word
[33:02] every day of their life because they had
[33:04] the commandments from moses they had the
[33:06] law they had the orders that were given
[33:08] they had the book of ordinances in every
[33:10] day of their life they were keeping the
[33:12] ordinances out of the book their whole
[33:14] life was structured around the word of
[33:16] god
[33:18] and they had received that word and they
[33:20] were walking in that word they were
[33:22] obeying that word amen but and they
[33:24] thought by keeping that word they were
[33:27] coming down the right lineage moses gave
[33:29] the word we come from abraham everything
[33:31] is established amen but when they
[33:33] rejected the word for their day
[33:38] it
[33:39] to jesus to jesus
[33:41] it no longer mattered how many
[33:43] ordinances they were keeping
[33:47] from the previous dispensation
[33:50] they could keep all of the ordinances
[33:52] but when they rejected the present tense
[33:54] word of god god said abraham is not your
[33:57] father
[33:59] amen
[34:02] oh praise god this is why the the the
[34:05] jews are having such dispute with jesus
[34:07] and his disciples amen because they have
[34:09] so ordered their life around what they
[34:11] thought the word was and what they
[34:13] thought it meant to be a child of
[34:14] abraham and what they thought it meant
[34:16] to be a chosen nation amen they they had
[34:19] gotten the details in the order to the
[34:21] ordinances and they had whole they had
[34:23] so fixed their life to match every
[34:25] ordinance but then when they saw jesus
[34:27] disciples and men walking through a
[34:29] field and plucking corn amen
[34:32] and eating it on the sabbath day they
[34:34] couldn't even imagine that this would
[34:36] have anything to do with god
[34:41] and then when they saw they ate with
[34:42] unwashed hands
[34:45] which was not part of the law which was
[34:47] not the word of god but it was added to
[34:51] by rabbis and teachers and priests but
[34:53] they had so gotten locked into the order
[34:57] to the church order that it all equaled
[35:00] salvation to them and all equaled amen
[35:02] being a seed of abraham and all equaled
[35:04] being under the promise
[35:08] so when they saw jesus disciples amen
[35:10] not towing up to the order
[35:14] they said
[35:15] there's something wrong with this this
[35:16] doesn't work
[35:20] how come they eat on the sabbath and
[35:22] jesus
[35:23] jesus never he never even addressed them
[35:26] eating on the sabbath he says didn't you
[35:29] read the bible when david walked in and
[35:31] took the show bread it was only for
[35:32] priests and gave those to the soldiers
[35:34] that were with him
[35:38] and they were like i'm sure i'm sure
[35:40] they were going
[35:42] but they're still eating on the sabbath
[35:46] and then he says the sabbath wasn't
[35:48] given
[35:49] the the man was not given to the sabbath
[35:52] but the sabbath was given to man
[35:54] it takes them all the way back to the
[35:56] principle in the mind of god that laid
[35:58] down the word to begin with
[36:01] but they wanted to hold to the concrete
[36:03] word
[36:05] and they missed the present tense word
[36:07] which was the reality
[36:11] and jesus could so clearly identify
[36:14] their father and their lineage on the
[36:16] spiritual side
[36:18] by how they responded to the word in
[36:20] their day
[36:25] let's read that again in verse 39 they
[36:27] answered and said unto him abraham as
[36:28] our father jesus said that him if you
[36:30] were abraham's children you would do the
[36:32] works of abraham
[36:34] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[36:36] hath told you the truth which i have
[36:38] heard of god this did not abraham
[36:42] you do the deeds of your father
[36:45] jesus just took it one step farther
[36:50] now jesus now i really i'm still talking
[36:54] about the book of life i thought that
[36:56] wednesday i was done but god let me know
[36:58] that i wasn't done
[37:01] but now jesus is saying
[37:04] you're of your father why did he say
[37:06] you're of your father because they were
[37:08] fighting the word for their day they
[37:10] were trying to destroy the vessel that
[37:12] contained the word that was trying to
[37:13] destroy the word made flesh in their day
[37:16] they were trying to shut it down keep it
[37:17] from speaking keep it from the people
[37:19] they were directly fighting against the
[37:21] word
[37:22] for their day and he could say no you're
[37:25] not of abraham abraham's not your father
[37:26] but you're of your father
[37:30] and they they instantly knew what this
[37:32] meant because the response is then said
[37:34] unto him we be not born to fornication
[37:36] we have one father even god
[37:39] we're not we we didn't come from that
[37:41] cain line we know what you're saying
[37:45] we're not born of fornication amen we
[37:47] have we have one father even god how can
[37:50] they say god was their father because if
[37:51] they come down from adam the the adam
[37:54] was a son of god so if you come all the
[37:56] way down then god is your father
[37:59] but they said we'd be not born a
[38:00] fornication we're not from that cane
[38:03] line they knew exactly what he was
[38:04] pointing to
[38:06] and jesus was not pointing to dna
[38:12] he was not looking at their dna he was
[38:14] not looking at the family tree amen he
[38:17] was looking at that spiritual line that
[38:19] line of life that bloodline that was
[38:21] coming all the way down through and that
[38:23] bloodline was the life of the word and
[38:25] that life of the word was coming down
[38:27] with the word amen stage by stage day by
[38:30] day age by age until finally that
[38:33] lifeline had come and all of it was now
[38:36] contained in this vessel here all of the
[38:38] word was standing there speaking to him
[38:40] the word that he had got from the father
[38:42] so it was the god it was god's word
[38:44] speaking through his mouth and when they
[38:46] fought against that he knew who their
[38:48] father was
[38:51] now jesus never said this to the people
[38:53] who didn't understand didn't get it
[38:55] didn't hear it
[38:58] he was not saying this to the ones who
[39:00] sat in the meetings and it went over
[39:01] their head
[39:06] he was saying this to the ones who were
[39:08] directly opposed to the word and
[39:10] fighting the
[39:12] word not the ones who didn't comprehend
[39:15] it who never came in contact with it
[39:16] never made a decision about it
[39:18] he wasn't talking to them
[39:21] he was talking to the ones who fought it
[39:22] and he says you're of your father
[39:27] let's go on
[39:29] verse 42 jesus said unto them if god
[39:31] were your father you would love me
[39:37] how many people
[39:40] let's put it this way
[39:41] how many millions of people on the earth
[39:44] on a sunday morning will say i love
[39:47] jesus
[39:53] i love jesus and and and what they're
[39:55] envisioning is is the jesus christ 2 000
[39:59] years ago who died in their place and
[40:01] they loved that jesus but i'm telling
[40:03] you jesus christ is here today
[40:07] that word that was in him is here today
[40:10] amen and to love him is to love the
[40:12] manifestation of the word for your day
[40:14] jesus was the word made flesh in their
[40:17] day and he says
[40:18] listen i'll just read it again he said
[40:21] if god were your father you would love
[40:23] me amen
[40:25] if god were your father you would love
[40:27] me not fight me and not be indifferent
[40:30] about me
[40:32] like there's three ways to respond
[40:36] either to love him
[40:40] to
[40:41] fight against him
[40:44] or to have never heard about it or have
[40:45] no opinion either way and not know
[40:49] amen
[40:52] jesus was invited to simon's house
[40:55] simon didn't love him
[40:57] but the harlot woman who come and wash
[40:59] his feet she loved him
[41:03] showing
[41:04] that simon had a different father than
[41:06] this harlot woman had
[41:11] the high priest wanted to kill him
[41:13] but the samaritan woman recognized him
[41:15] as messiah
[41:18] proving her father was gone and she was
[41:21] of abraham c oh but she was a samaritan
[41:23] how but she was of abraham's seed
[41:28] and the high priest was of his father
[41:30] the devil
[41:33] amen
[41:34] it's never what it appears to be
[41:37] that's why when we really get to
[41:40] what the message has done for us friends
[41:42] is so remarkable that when the when the
[41:44] when the message came the seals opened
[41:46] the bible became a new book now you can
[41:48] go back and you can read the book amen
[41:50] and what brother branham has done is he
[41:52] was so good at placing us back in the
[41:55] day and not reading it from a 2000 year
[41:58] previous past history amen where we know
[42:00] everything we know now looking back but
[42:02] going back into that day into that hour
[42:05] and recognizing what jesus was preaching
[42:07] was absolutely turning them upside down
[42:10] it was so contrary to anything they had
[42:12] heard
[42:14] what he was saying to them was blasphemy
[42:16] what he was saying was absolutely wrong
[42:19] and contrary to the bible they were
[42:20] reading
[42:23] they were abraham seed they were the
[42:26] lineage of isaac amen they were part of
[42:28] the 12 sons of jacob
[42:30] and they were reading their bible
[42:32] finding their position naturally amen
[42:35] through all of that and when jesus comes
[42:37] and said if god were your father you
[42:39] would love me amen you do the works of
[42:41] your father
[42:44] he was a liar from the beginning
[42:47] he said if god were your father you
[42:48] would love me abraham were your father
[42:50] amen you would believe me
[42:53] and now they're looking and reading
[42:55] their bible and thinking this man is
[42:57] crazy
[42:59] amen remember this was before the temple
[43:01] was destroyed and before all the records
[43:03] were destroyed
[43:05] they could go back to the temple and
[43:07] trace the family line and leap all the
[43:09] way back and find out their tribal
[43:11] father and their tribal father goes to
[43:13] jacob amen jacob goes to isaac isaac
[43:15] goes to abraham
[43:19] and because they could leaf through
[43:21] parchments
[43:24] and they could find their way back
[43:25] naturally
[43:27] they thought that they were the seed of
[43:29] abraham and jesus comes along and said
[43:31] abraham i know you're the seed of
[43:33] abraham i can live through the same
[43:34] thing in fact i don't even
[43:36] need to leave through it i know it
[43:39] i know you're the seed of abraham but
[43:40] abraham's not your father you have
[43:42] another father
[43:46] and they knew what he was talking about
[43:50] so you see
[43:52] jesus is making a uh
[43:56] jesus is making a declaration of their
[43:59] origin based off their conduct with the
[44:02] living word
[44:06] and really that matches the whole bible
[44:11] that's not just in jesus day like this
[44:13] this message that god has given to us
[44:15] amen it took the seals off and unlocked
[44:18] the entire word the whole bible is
[44:20] unlocked not just this passage or that
[44:22] passage but the whole book is now
[44:23] unlocked
[44:27] amen
[44:28] you know there's there's some churches
[44:30] out there that will only call themselves
[44:32] new testament churches and will only
[44:33] preach the new testament
[44:36] because they believe the old testament
[44:37] for the jews and the new testament and
[44:39] so they'll call themselves a new
[44:40] testament church and they will only read
[44:42] out of the new testament there's whole
[44:43] denominations that will do that
[44:46] but listen my promise amen that you find
[44:49] in the new testament
[44:50] my promise originated in the old
[44:52] testament amen because i'm seed of
[44:54] abraham and the promise to abraham is my
[44:56] promise too and the promise that he'll
[44:58] be heir of the world is my promise as
[45:00] well
[45:01] because i am part of the seed of abraham
[45:05] so i want the whole book amen not just
[45:08] the new testament not just these books
[45:10] not just this section i want the whole
[45:12] thing because i can find my lineage
[45:15] through the entire scripture
[45:20] amen
[45:23] let's keep reading
[45:29] all right verse 42 again jesus said unto
[45:31] them if god were your father you would
[45:33] love me
[45:34] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[45:36] neither came i of myself but he sent me
[45:40] why do you not understand my speech even
[45:42] because you cannot hear my word
[45:45] i love this scripture
[45:48] amen jesus was having dialogue back and
[45:51] forth
[45:53] so could they hear him speak
[45:56] yes
[45:58] amen if they had been deaf they would
[46:01] have come to him for prayer and he would
[46:02] have healed them
[46:04] but jesus is speaking on a whole nother
[46:07] level
[46:09] he says
[46:11] he says why do you not understand my
[46:12] speech even because you cannot hear my
[46:15] word amen jesus is speaking and he's
[46:18] speaking to them and he's speaking
[46:20] another language although he's probably
[46:22] speaking aramaic
[46:24] and they're understanding aramaic but
[46:26] he's speaking another language because
[46:28] he's speaking a language he got from his
[46:30] father so now he's speaking a heavenly
[46:32] language
[46:34] and he may speak in aramaic speaking
[46:35] hebrew you can speak in greek you can
[46:37] speak it in english you can speak in
[46:38] russian but even today amen christ is
[46:41] here on earth and his bride and she is
[46:43] speaking another language
[46:46] she's speaking a heavenly language and
[46:48] why can't some hear it
[46:52] jesus says
[46:54] you do not understand my speech even
[46:57] because you cannot hear my word
[47:00] so god christ is appealing to another
[47:02] set of ears
[47:04] verse 44 you are of your father the
[47:06] devil
[47:07] and the lust of your father you will do
[47:09] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[47:11] abode not in the truth because there was
[47:13] no truth in him when he speak of the lie
[47:15] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[47:17] and the father of it i don't think
[47:20] there's any wiggle room now on who he's
[47:22] talking about
[47:26] and this whole concept that says to be a
[47:28] christian you always have to be really
[47:30] sweet
[47:31] well they were not viewing jesus as
[47:33] sweet and kind right here
[47:37] he was telling them the truth and he was
[47:39] telling in love and man he didn't hate
[47:41] them he was telling them the truth
[47:45] but he was telling them exactly where
[47:46] they are you're of your father the devil
[47:50] how did he come to this understanding
[47:53] based off remember he's going back he's
[47:55] basing the whole thing on the way they
[47:57] react to the word made flesh in their
[47:59] day
[48:01] you have your father the devil and the
[48:02] lust of your father you will do boy he
[48:05] just nails it all down verse 45 and
[48:07] because i tell you the truth you believe
[48:10] me not
[48:11] which if you convince which of you
[48:13] convinces me of sin and if i say the
[48:15] truth why do you not believe me
[48:17] he that is of god heareth god's words ye
[48:20] therefore hear them not because you are
[48:22] not of god
[48:24] then answered the jews and said unto him
[48:27] say we not well that thou art samaritan
[48:29] and has a devil
[48:35] what else could they say i mean
[48:38] they answered back and say
[48:40] didn't weren't we right when we said
[48:41] you're a samaritan you have a devil
[48:44] oh my goodness they didn't want to hear
[48:46] that they didn't believe they didn't
[48:49] believe it because of the natural
[48:52] because the natural lineage natural this
[48:54] natural that they couldn't believe it
[48:56] amen but there was people in that day
[48:58] that could receive the word made flesh
[49:00] in their day and when they received that
[49:02] word in their day it declared their
[49:04] origin who their father was who they
[49:06] came up what lineage they're a part of
[49:08] and what promises that they can receive
[49:12] let's go to galatians chapter 3.
[49:18] i love bible studies like this
[49:28] galatians chapter 3.
[49:31] i'm going to start at verse 6.
[49:35] even as abraham believed god and it was
[49:37] accounted to him for righteousness
[49:39] know you therefore that they which are
[49:41] of faith the same are the children of
[49:43] abraham
[49:45] all right so where are you at
[49:47] i'm in the bible
[49:49] i'm in chapter 3 verse 7
[49:51] that's me
[49:52] therefore they that which are the faith
[49:54] the same are the children of abraham and
[49:57] the scripture for seeing that god would
[49:58] justify the heathen through faith
[50:00] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[50:03] saying in thee shall all nations be
[50:05] blessed so then they which be of faith
[50:08] are blessed with faithful abraham for as
[50:10] many as are of the works of the law are
[50:12] under the curse for it is written cursed
[50:14] as every one that continueth not in all
[50:17] things which are written in the book of
[50:18] law to do them
[50:20] but that no man is justified by the law
[50:22] in the sight of god it is evident for
[50:24] the just shall live by faith
[50:26] and the law is not of faith but the man
[50:28] that doeth them shall live in them
[50:30] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[50:32] of the law being made a curse for us for
[50:34] it is written cursed is every one that
[50:36] hangeth on a tree that the blessing of
[50:38] abraham might come on the gentiles
[50:40] through jesus christ that we might
[50:42] receive the promise of the spirit
[50:44] through faith
[50:46] brethren i speak after the manner of men
[50:47] though it be but
[50:49] a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed
[50:51] no man disannulleth or addeth thereto
[50:54] now that abraham and his seed were the
[50:56] promises made he saith not unto seeds as
[51:00] of many but as of one and to thy seed
[51:03] which is christ
[51:05] oh now brother paul's nailing it down
[51:08] he's zeroing it in he's tightening it up
[51:11] he's saying the promise was not to seeds
[51:14] as of many but the promise was seed as
[51:17] of one
[51:19] amen we can see this even in the natural
[51:22] amen because when when when we know that
[51:24] that abraham first had ishmael
[51:27] but he wasn't the seed of promise
[51:30] isaac was so he had isaac amen and then
[51:32] after sarah dies he marries and he has
[51:34] more children amen but none of that
[51:36] other natural seed is the seed of
[51:38] promise the seed of promise was isaac
[51:42] because isaac was the word amen
[51:46] was isaac the word
[51:48] isaac was the word made flesh
[51:50] because god had told him before you have
[51:52] a son out of your own loins amen from
[51:55] sarah amen that was the child of promise
[51:57] that was the word made flesh when isaac
[52:00] was born
[52:03] so so we see this in the natural amen
[52:06] how even abraham could have many seeds
[52:08] but there was one seed isaac but now
[52:10] paul is bringing it into the spiritual
[52:12] side and he said now abraham and his
[52:14] seed were the promises made
[52:16] so that promise doesn't go to every
[52:19] natural avenue amen of abraham he said
[52:22] now abraham and his seed where the
[52:24] promise is made he saith not unto seeds
[52:26] as of many but as of one and to thy seed
[52:30] which is christ
[52:33] so what is the seed of abraham christ
[52:37] who are the promises to christ
[52:40] christ is the royal seed christ is the
[52:43] faith see christ is the seed of promise
[52:47] do we agree
[52:51] verse 17 in this i say that the covenant
[52:53] that was confirmed before of god in
[52:55] christ the law which was 430 years after
[52:58] cannot disannul that it should make the
[53:01] promise of none effect for if the
[53:03] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[53:05] of promise but god gave it to abraham
[53:08] by promise
[53:11] so it's it's by promise it's by the word
[53:14] of god it's by the foreknowledge of god
[53:16] because it was given by promise for what
[53:18] comes in the future and that's the
[53:20] foreknowledge of god
[53:22] let's go to verse 26
[53:25] for year all the children of god by
[53:27] faith in christ jesus
[53:29] for as many of you as have been baptized
[53:31] into christ have put on christ there is
[53:33] neither jew nor greek there is neither
[53:36] bond nor free there is neither male nor
[53:38] female for you are all one in christ
[53:42] jesus
[53:43] and if you be christ then ye are
[53:45] abraham's seed
[53:48] and heirs according to the promise
[53:53] praise be to god if you have put on
[53:57] christ by a new birth if you be christ
[54:00] amen by being born again by the spirit
[54:02] of god then you are abraham's seed and
[54:05] heirs of the promise amen that means
[54:08] everything abraham was promised is
[54:10] promised to me every thing abraham every
[54:13] blessing abraham was under is my
[54:15] blessing too
[54:17] amen so you see how the apostle paul now
[54:21] he comes here and he is absolutely
[54:23] unraveling amen church doctrine he's
[54:26] unraveling church teaching amen and he's
[54:29] bringing uh you know for for thousands
[54:32] of years they've understood this bible a
[54:34] certain way and down through hundreds of
[54:36] years as it unfolded amen but paul comes
[54:39] and he's taught by god himself christ
[54:42] himself is the teacher and christ gives
[54:44] him a revelation and when he looks at
[54:46] that word he's saying now listen that
[54:48] seed you're making a mistake you're
[54:50] thinking that it was it was the dna that
[54:53] went into isaac and the dna from isaac
[54:55] that went into jacob and the d and a
[54:57] from jacob and to the 12 sons he said
[55:00] you're wrong it's not the dna because
[55:02] that seed amen was not dna that seed was
[55:06] christ
[55:09] so what was isaac isaac was christ
[55:15] brother chad how can you say such a
[55:16] thing
[55:17] because brother branham said such a
[55:18] thing that's how i could say it let me
[55:22] find it here i've got to skip down i'm
[55:23] getting all out of whack
[55:26] and the message three kinds of believers
[55:28] from november of 1963 brother bram said
[55:30] he that receiveth my words and believeth
[55:32] on him that sent me has already passed
[55:35] from death to life
[55:36] but can you receive the word first can
[55:38] you receive the word all the word all of
[55:40] christ
[55:41] christ
[55:42] is the anointed word he is the word
[55:46] anointed
[55:48] christ means the anointed one the
[55:50] anointed word for that day
[55:53] made manifest
[55:55] the savior the redeemer i'm going to
[55:58] read that again so we all lock it in
[56:00] christ means the anointed one the
[56:02] anointed word for that day made manifest
[56:07] so what is christ the anointed word for
[56:09] that day made manifest
[56:12] what was isaac isaac was the fulfillment
[56:14] of a promise of god isaac was the
[56:17] fulfillment of the word of god isaac was
[56:19] a prophecy that god had gave a promise
[56:21] that god had gave and when the word of
[56:23] god that went out of a spoken word now
[56:26] come and made manifest and was birthed
[56:28] that was the seed of abraham that was
[56:31] christ the anointed word for that day
[56:33] made manifest
[56:37] amen
[56:39] so
[56:40] isaac
[56:41] was a manifestation of christ it was
[56:43] christ in isaac amen so now it's not the
[56:46] flesh line it's the spiritual line as
[56:50] the words moving down brother branham
[56:52] tells us that the word is spirit because
[56:54] jesus tell us the word that i speak unto
[56:56] you they are spirit and they are life
[57:00] so the the nothing has life without the
[57:02] spirit the spirit is what gives it life
[57:04] when the spirit goes out of something
[57:05] it's dead
[57:08] so the word
[57:10] the word has in it a spirit there's the
[57:12] word and spirit are the same thing
[57:16] so as the word is moving down through
[57:19] time amen the word the present tense
[57:22] word the word for your day has life in
[57:26] it it is life it is the location of life
[57:29] it is christ
[57:33] so what is christ
[57:35] christ means the anointed when the
[57:36] anointed word for that day made manifest
[57:41] so that's
[57:42] how the promise
[57:44] was given to abraham and how the promise
[57:48] could move right down to the gentiles
[57:50] that have no
[57:52] genetic
[57:53] tie
[57:54] to abraham
[57:58] see what paul is preaching is
[58:00] revolutionary
[58:02] what paul is preaching amen what paul is
[58:05] preaching sounds like blasphemy to their
[58:07] ears because for generations they've
[58:10] been tied into the natural fulfillment
[58:12] they've been locked into isaac's birth
[58:15] record amen the birth record of jacob
[58:17] the birth record of the 12 sons they've
[58:19] been locked into that so long that they
[58:21] missed that that was just the word
[58:23] coming into manifestation in its season
[58:26] they saw birth take place but they
[58:28] didn't realize those births were taking
[58:30] a place according to the foreknowledge
[58:31] of god
[58:34] and as they were coming on the earth and
[58:35] manifesting as jacob's 12 sons come into
[58:38] manifestation amen they were the word of
[58:40] god made manifest in that day
[58:42] so what was it christ in that day
[58:47] amen when moses was born a proper child
[58:50] amen moses came by the foreknowledge of
[58:52] god it was the word of god from the
[58:54] thoughts of god when god knew his word
[58:57] coming down through amen oh praise be
[59:00] the god god wrote his first bible where
[59:02] in the heavens
[59:04] he wrote his second bible
[59:07] in the pyramid
[59:09] and we've got a record of those two in
[59:11] the written word
[59:14] but god was manifesting what was written
[59:17] in the heavens and written the pyramid
[59:18] all down through time
[59:20] what was he doing he was writing in life
[59:24] the manifestation of that word
[59:26] so when moses came forth born a proper
[59:29] child he was christ
[59:33] why was he christ because abraham
[59:35] received the prophecy that after 400
[59:37] years amen i'll deliver your children
[59:39] out with a mighty hand
[59:41] so that prophecy required a deliverer
[59:45] and the deliverer was already in the
[59:46] mind of god which is where the word of
[59:48] god comes from
[59:51] and when god speaks that word amen that
[59:54] word now now moves down into place when
[59:56] that word comes in manifestation in its
[59:59] day it is christ
[1:00:01] and it has the life in it
[1:00:06] that's why to receive that was life and
[1:00:08] to reject that was death
[1:00:13] so i got to go way back up here
[1:00:18] praise god
[1:00:21] now
[1:00:22] if
[1:00:24] you by grace
[1:00:27] have a faith seed inside the ability to
[1:00:29] believe your word manifest for your day
[1:00:33] then it shows that you are christ
[1:00:38] and if you are a christ you are
[1:00:39] abraham's seed and heir to all the
[1:00:41] promises
[1:00:44] amen so if we can find ourselves in this
[1:00:46] position by the word amen then there
[1:00:48] should be nothing that troubles us
[1:00:50] friend there should be nothing god
[1:00:52] foresaw this before the foundation of
[1:00:54] the world his word has been coming down
[1:00:56] through a line of life a line of the
[1:00:58] word a bloodline a lifeline you can call
[1:01:01] it anything you want it's the lamb's
[1:01:03] book of life being written out in each
[1:01:04] age in each generation
[1:01:08] and when you come and you find yourself
[1:01:10] in that on that line you find yourself
[1:01:12] by grace placed there by a revelation
[1:01:15] that god has given you then you're on
[1:01:17] the lifeline amen you're part of that
[1:01:19] expression god is expressing the word
[1:01:22] through you in this day and you are
[1:01:24] united with christ and you are christ
[1:01:26] and you are abraham's seed
[1:01:30] and if god could take care of the
[1:01:32] lineage all the way down through can he
[1:01:33] not take care of it now
[1:01:36] if god has watched over it listen this
[1:01:39] was in the thinking of god before the
[1:01:41] foundation of the world god knew who
[1:01:43] would become and when they would be
[1:01:45] expressed what age they'd be expressed
[1:01:46] and what they would accomplish
[1:01:48] did he know that
[1:01:50] he knew his seed he knew the christ line
[1:01:52] he knew the word line he knew it all
[1:01:54] before the foundation of the world and
[1:01:56] as it's coming down through amen he's
[1:01:58] watching over it he's moving it in
[1:02:00] position he's rearranging the the
[1:02:02] politics of the entire world he's
[1:02:04] restructuring everything to keep this
[1:02:06] moving
[1:02:09] and if you can find yourself as part of
[1:02:11] that word
[1:02:13] then what a consolation it should bring
[1:02:16] what a peace what a reassurance amen
[1:02:18] what a satisfaction to know that god has
[1:02:20] not messed up yet
[1:02:24] he's not going to mess up now
[1:02:28] amen let's go to romans chapter 9.
[1:02:33] i love this word
[1:02:45] romans chapter 9 verse 6.
[1:02:53] romans 9
[1:02:55] 6
[1:02:56] not as though the word of god hath taken
[1:02:58] none effect
[1:03:00] for they are not all israel which are of
[1:03:02] israel
[1:03:03] paul's saying the same thing
[1:03:06] they may be of israel but they're not
[1:03:07] israel
[1:03:09] they may be natural but they're not
[1:03:10] spiritual
[1:03:13] neither because they are the seed of
[1:03:15] abraham are they all children but in
[1:03:17] isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:03:21] this is they which are the children of
[1:03:23] flesh these are not the children of god
[1:03:26] but the children of promise are counted
[1:03:28] for the seed all right paul's saying the
[1:03:31] same thing it's not the natural lineage
[1:03:34] that's what he's saying
[1:03:35] all israel is not israel amen amen it's
[1:03:39] not it's it's the seed of promise
[1:03:42] is the seed of abraham what god promised
[1:03:45] to come when it comes that's the seed of
[1:03:47] abraham
[1:03:49] not every seed that's born but the seed
[1:03:52] of promise that's the seed
[1:03:55] so if it was promised
[1:03:57] by the word of god and then it comes in
[1:04:00] its season in a fulfillment to the will
[1:04:03] of god and that promise comes into
[1:04:05] manifestation that's the seed of god
[1:04:09] and guess what god promised that he'd
[1:04:11] have a bride without spot or wrinkle in
[1:04:13] the end time amen that's the promise all
[1:04:16] of those who are fulfilling that portion
[1:04:17] of the word are part of christ are part
[1:04:20] of the seed
[1:04:21] the one seed the seed line
[1:04:26] praise be to god let's keep reading now
[1:04:29] i want to read verse 8 again that is
[1:04:31] they which are the children of flesh are
[1:04:33] not the children of god
[1:04:36] imagine being a jew hearing that that
[1:04:38] day
[1:04:40] they are not the children of god
[1:04:42] but the children of the promise are
[1:04:44] counted for the seed
[1:04:46] for this is the word of promise at this
[1:04:48] time will i come and sarah shall have a
[1:04:50] son
[1:04:50] and not only this but when rebecca also
[1:04:52] had conceived by one even by our father
[1:04:55] isaac for the children being not yet
[1:04:57] born neither having done any good or
[1:04:59] evil that the purpose
[1:05:00] of god according to election might stand
[1:05:03] not of works but of him that calleth it
[1:05:05] was said unto her the elder shall serve
[1:05:08] the younger as it is written jacob have
[1:05:10] i loved but esau have i hated
[1:05:14] oh what a fantastic scripture friends
[1:05:17] because now he's saying he's saying it's
[1:05:19] not
[1:05:20] the natural children amen let's go back
[1:05:23] to verse 8 they which are the children
[1:05:25] of the flesh they are not the children
[1:05:27] of god but the children of promise are
[1:05:30] counted for the seed
[1:05:32] so it's not the children of flesh that
[1:05:34] are the children of god but the children
[1:05:36] of promise are the ones counted for the
[1:05:38] seed
[1:05:39] this is so important because when you
[1:05:41] get down to isaac amen the promise goes
[1:05:43] from abraham to isaac isaac was the
[1:05:45] promised word for that day
[1:05:48] he was christ he was given a bride that
[1:05:52] bride come from eliezer eliezer went and
[1:05:54] fetched the bride amen brought her back
[1:05:56] she was the word for that day
[1:05:59] the two coming together was the word for
[1:06:01] that day
[1:06:03] the two coming together they came
[1:06:05] together in a natural union and in the
[1:06:08] natural union they produced twins
[1:06:12] oh the apostle paul is so good here
[1:06:16] he is so good
[1:06:18] at taking the bible that the jews are
[1:06:20] reading and prove what he's saying by
[1:06:23] the bible that they're reading
[1:06:25] and he goes all the way back
[1:06:28] to jacob and esau and he says look isaac
[1:06:31] was the promise
[1:06:33] rebecca and isaac coming together
[1:06:35] fulfillment of the promised word they
[1:06:37] come together amen to produce the
[1:06:40] produce another seed which was still the
[1:06:41] promise of the word but they had twins
[1:06:44] there was two that came out of the same
[1:06:45] mother the same father if this was
[1:06:48] natural if these were the natural
[1:06:50] children of the flesh would be children
[1:06:51] of god esau would have to be a child of
[1:06:54] god
[1:06:56] but esau before the children were born
[1:07:02] god told rebecca that the younger the
[1:07:05] the older shall serve the younger god
[1:07:07] had already given his spoken word and
[1:07:10] now when it comes out amen esau and
[1:07:12] jacob they they live their lives they do
[1:07:14] their things esau's the better man
[1:07:16] according to the prophet
[1:07:18] takes better care of his daddy he's a
[1:07:19] better son jacob says shyster amen he's
[1:07:22] a surplanter he's always getting in
[1:07:24] fixes and he cheats his dad cheats his
[1:07:26] brother runs away comes back amen but he
[1:07:29] was the seed of promise esau wasn't by
[1:07:32] the foreknowledge and predestination of
[1:07:34] god by election where god will make his
[1:07:36] choice before
[1:07:39] so it was not based off conduct because
[1:07:41] it was based off conduct again esau
[1:07:43] would have been the choice not jacob
[1:07:46] but god already had a thought before the
[1:07:49] foundation of the world that jacob have
[1:07:52] i loved but esau have i hated
[1:07:56] god already prophesied to rebecca before
[1:07:59] the children are born the placing of the
[1:08:00] sons so when jacob although he's not the
[1:08:04] one that we would have enjoyed being
[1:08:06] friends with he's not the one we would
[1:08:07] have picked for the seed
[1:08:11] he does all kinds of stuff to his family
[1:08:13] he teaches family
[1:08:15] what kind of person cheats their family
[1:08:19] well somebody who has the potential of
[1:08:21] being a child of god
[1:08:23] [Laughter]
[1:08:25] i love the bible friends
[1:08:28] because it's what what matters more than
[1:08:31] anything in this world is what god
[1:08:33] thought before the foundation of the
[1:08:34] world it is the it is what matters it is
[1:08:37] the absolute amen it is the foundation
[1:08:39] it is the seed it is the word it is the
[1:08:41] life it's everything
[1:08:44] so now they come from the natural line
[1:08:47] and the jews are all natural line
[1:08:49] natural line natural line natural line
[1:08:51] but now paul takes the bible and says
[1:08:53] okay natural line
[1:08:57] let's go back to jacob and esau
[1:09:03] see
[1:09:05] god's line
[1:09:07] god's seed of abraham
[1:09:10] is by election
[1:09:12] by foreknowledge
[1:09:14] by god's choosing before the foundation
[1:09:17] of the world
[1:09:18] so when they were born and expressed two
[1:09:21] different natures two different lives
[1:09:23] amen esau would have been the one who
[1:09:26] would have got the gold star for merit
[1:09:30] and jacob would have been put in
[1:09:31] remedial training
[1:09:34] but jacob was where the promised word
[1:09:37] was
[1:09:38] so jacob was the promised word for his
[1:09:41] day jacob became the christ in his day
[1:09:47] how so because god chose it so
[1:09:50] not by what he did but what god chose
[1:09:53] not by his choice but by god's choice
[1:09:57] and when that came down
[1:09:59] that now
[1:10:00] was the promised seed
[1:10:03] and esau was not the promised seed and
[1:10:06] now the lineage moves on down through
[1:10:09] to 12 sons and this and that and the
[1:10:11] other
[1:10:12] they got hung up in the one born of this
[1:10:15] one and born of this one and born of
[1:10:16] this one but what paul was able to do
[1:10:19] was look beyond amen just what the eyes
[1:10:22] could see and go back into the mind of
[1:10:25] god and say oh
[1:10:26] it makes sense because god already
[1:10:28] foresaw jacob and not esau
[1:10:31] so jacob was the seed of promise that's
[1:10:32] why the seed line went right down
[1:10:34] through that without that understanding
[1:10:36] you're looking at jacob and esau and
[1:10:37] saying how did god pick what do they do
[1:10:39] what should i emulate to be the right
[1:10:41] one
[1:10:43] what kind of deeds can i do what kind of
[1:10:44] acts should i act what should i do to be
[1:10:47] the one that god would choose and he's
[1:10:49] looking at the life of jacob and esau
[1:10:51] showing that you can't look at their
[1:10:52] life to decide which one's the seed amen
[1:10:54] that was four known before the
[1:10:56] foundation of the world the thought of
[1:10:58] god will bring the change in the
[1:10:59] necessary time
[1:11:02] but they could not become seed by making
[1:11:04] a change themselves
[1:11:08] but god's thought amen is not going to
[1:11:11] be thwarted by anybody's attitude
[1:11:14] by anybody's conduct god has a way
[1:11:18] of orchestrating the circumstances until
[1:11:20] he can finally get a surrender so that
[1:11:22] his word could come in the manifestation
[1:11:24] because jacob was foreordained to be the
[1:11:27] christ in his day
[1:11:31] praise be to god now let's go back
[1:11:35] to genesis
[1:11:37] chapter 12.
[1:11:58] genesis chapter 12 verse 1
[1:12:01] now the lord had said unto abram get
[1:12:03] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:12:05] kindred and from my father's house into
[1:12:07] a land that i will show thee
[1:12:09] and i will make of thee a great nation
[1:12:11] and i will bless thee and make thy name
[1:12:12] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[1:12:15] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:12:18] and curse them that curseth thee
[1:12:20] and in thee shall all the families of
[1:12:22] the earth be blessed
[1:12:27] i want to stop here for a minute
[1:12:30] and look at this promise this is a
[1:12:32] promise given to abraham
[1:12:35] but remember abraham's promise goes to
[1:12:37] abraham's seed
[1:12:41] and
[1:12:42] and the everyone in the bible i mean all
[1:12:45] bible scholars and bible teachers would
[1:12:47] tell you
[1:12:48] that this verse chapter verse 2 and
[1:12:51] verse 3 is pointing to the coming of
[1:12:53] christ
[1:12:54] as in jesus christ of nazareth but what
[1:12:57] they failed to see is it's pointing to
[1:12:59] the coming of christ
[1:13:01] everywhere christ comes
[1:13:05] every time the promised word is made
[1:13:07] manifest in that season amen there the
[1:13:10] promise of abraham lies amen and listen
[1:13:13] to what it said
[1:13:16] i will bless thee and make thee a great
[1:13:18] name and thou shalt thou shalt be a
[1:13:21] blessing
[1:13:22] so abraham did not go forth just to be
[1:13:25] blessed god called abraham to be a
[1:13:28] blessing why because christ is always a
[1:13:31] blessing
[1:13:32] everywhere he goes christ is a blessing
[1:13:35] amen if you can receive the blessing and
[1:13:38] he says in verse 3 and i will bless them
[1:13:40] that bless thee and curse him that
[1:13:42] curseth thee and in thee shall all the
[1:13:44] families of the earth be
[1:13:46] blessed i say if we can find ourselves
[1:13:49] in christ how many believe you're in
[1:13:50] christ
[1:13:52] then you're a seat of abraham you
[1:13:53] believe your seat of abraham
[1:13:55] then you're under the promise abraham
[1:13:57] you believe that we're under the promise
[1:13:58] of abraham according to the bible
[1:14:00] then this promise is upon you you are on
[1:14:03] this earth to be a blessing
[1:14:05] that's why you're here you're on this
[1:14:08] earth to be a blessing because the
[1:14:09] promise of abraham is on you and that
[1:14:11] whoever blesses you will be blessed and
[1:14:13] whoever curses you will be cursed
[1:14:17] why
[1:14:18] because that's where god's word is in
[1:14:20] this day
[1:14:21] wherever the seed of abraham is
[1:14:25] to bless god's word is to be blessed
[1:14:29] to curse god's word
[1:14:30] is to be cursed
[1:14:34] i
[1:14:35] i so want this understanding this
[1:14:38] revelation to soak into me that it will
[1:14:40] change my conduct every day and i will
[1:14:43] realize i am a seed of abraham by faith
[1:14:47] i am a seed of abraham by union with
[1:14:49] christ i am a seed of abraham and the
[1:14:51] promise of abraham is upon me and i am
[1:14:54] here to be a blessing to anyone that can
[1:14:56] receive a blessing
[1:15:00] amen let's go on let's go to hebrews
[1:15:02] chapter six there's a few more i want to
[1:15:04] read real quick
[1:15:05] hebrews chapter 6.
[1:15:10] i trust you're enjoying the bible study
[1:15:14] there are so many scriptures
[1:15:17] on this
[1:15:20] see
[1:15:21] one thing that i find amazing is when
[1:15:24] you you when you i've said this so many
[1:15:26] times about i'll say it again i'll
[1:15:27] probably say it a thousand more times so
[1:15:28] forgive me but if you look at the way
[1:15:30] jesus handled the word in his day he did
[1:15:33] not speak the word when he was speaking
[1:15:35] of what moses taught and all of this and
[1:15:37] even jonas he was taking scriptures from
[1:15:40] david and from jonas and from joel and
[1:15:42] from zechariah and all of these things
[1:15:44] and he was preaching in a way they had
[1:15:46] never heard it preached like that before
[1:15:49] they couldn't even understand it applied
[1:15:50] that way it didn't even make any sense
[1:15:53] to them the way that jesus was
[1:15:54] presenting the word because he was
[1:15:56] presenting it so differently than their
[1:15:58] intellectual understanding and then the
[1:16:00] apostle paul comes and does the same
[1:16:01] thing with the scriptures we read i'm
[1:16:04] telling you it's hard to go back and
[1:16:06] think like a jew we've never thought
[1:16:07] like a jew but if you could go back and
[1:16:09] think like a jew and then paul would be
[1:16:11] absolutely
[1:16:13] tearing the height off of you your
[1:16:15] understanding
[1:16:17] flipping your understanding on its heel
[1:16:18] and messing up everything that you had
[1:16:20] learned all of your life
[1:16:23] but i tell you the prophet of god in our
[1:16:24] day did the exact same thing to the
[1:16:26] denominational understanding of the word
[1:16:30] and when the word comes to fulfillment
[1:16:31] and the interpretation of the word is
[1:16:33] always different than the humanistic
[1:16:36] understanding of being able to read
[1:16:37] words
[1:16:39] being able to read words and comprehend
[1:16:41] language amen when when jesus came he
[1:16:43] tore that to shreds when paul came he
[1:16:46] tore that to shreds and when brother
[1:16:47] branham came he tore that to shreds
[1:16:53] that's why people say i don't need
[1:16:55] anything else i just want my bible
[1:16:56] that's wonderful if you've got eyes to
[1:16:58] see and ears they're here you'll be good
[1:17:00] but if you're reading it the way the
[1:17:02] jews read their bible when jesus was
[1:17:04] here you'll be as lost as the jews who
[1:17:06] were rejecting jesus
[1:17:08] because they they didn't want this they
[1:17:10] just wanted their bible but this was
[1:17:12] their bible
[1:17:15] amen and we've come to the end of time
[1:17:17] where god and his mercy and grace has
[1:17:19] sent a prophet in this age and that
[1:17:21] prophet was here to bring the correct
[1:17:22] interpretation of the word to illuminate
[1:17:24] the word so that we could see the
[1:17:26] scriptures the way god wanted the
[1:17:28] scripture seen and you have people with
[1:17:30] the audacity to say i don't want that i
[1:17:32] just want my bible you put yourself
[1:17:34] right back where the jews were in the
[1:17:36] day jesus was here because this message
[1:17:38] is christ
[1:17:42] in and it's it's
[1:17:46] it's troubling to me to hear statements
[1:17:48] like that
[1:17:49] because it shows there's no revelation
[1:17:51] but what hurts me worse than anything is
[1:17:53] when message believers will take that
[1:17:55] kind of language and say you know i
[1:17:57] don't want to uh i don't want to you
[1:17:59] know quote brother branham this much i
[1:18:01] don't want to do that i just want to
[1:18:02] stick with the bible amen brother
[1:18:04] branham was sticking with the bible
[1:18:06] do you think he's saying something
[1:18:07] different than the bible what's your
[1:18:09] revelation of what the message is
[1:18:12] and brother bam said you can never
[1:18:13] separate the messenger in his message
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:19] so
[1:18:19] i don't mind taking somebody through
[1:18:21] scriptures i have no problem with that
[1:18:24] but but to be afraid
[1:18:27] of the very mechanism god sent in our
[1:18:30] day to give us this word
[1:18:33] i don't think that's right
[1:18:36] i don't think it's right because what
[1:18:39] authority eventually no matter how many
[1:18:41] bible studies you do you're eventually
[1:18:43] going to hang up somewhere
[1:18:46] to where you see a scripture this way
[1:18:49] and somebody else will take the same
[1:18:50] scripture and see it another way
[1:18:53] and you're quoting the same scriptures
[1:18:57] and not not adding anybody else's
[1:18:59] dialogue just your own understanding
[1:19:01] that scripture and your own
[1:19:02] understanding of scripture and coming to
[1:19:03] two different conclusions at the end of
[1:19:05] the day somebody has to have the
[1:19:08] authority to say this is the right
[1:19:10] interpretation of that scripture and if
[1:19:12] you don't have a vindicated prophet who
[1:19:14] is able to say this is the correct
[1:19:16] interpretation of that word
[1:19:19] so when we want to leave the when we
[1:19:21] want to leave the messenger out of the
[1:19:22] message and take just the bible listen
[1:19:25] friends you're not going to work
[1:19:27] somewhere along the line you're going to
[1:19:28] get hung up in a place that eventually
[1:19:31] the only way that the only way that you
[1:19:35] can be right on that scripture is if god
[1:19:37] sent a prophet to vindicate that that's
[1:19:39] the correct interpretation of that
[1:19:41] scripture
[1:19:44] because if not it could be your view
[1:19:46] versus their view
[1:19:48] your understanding versus their
[1:19:50] understanding and and listen if you've
[1:19:53] ever gotten to those conversations at
[1:19:54] some point you just throw in the town
[1:19:56] say hey listen here's how i know
[1:20:00] how do you know you're right here's how
[1:20:02] i know because god sent a prophet so
[1:20:04] vindicated so thoroughly vindicated that
[1:20:06] prophet so that we would understand that
[1:20:08] this is the authority god has sent on
[1:20:10] the word listen if we try to leave the
[1:20:12] prophet away separate him from the bible
[1:20:15] then what we're trying to do is ignore
[1:20:17] the vindication that god gave because
[1:20:19] look at the effort god went to vindicate
[1:20:22] that man's ministry
[1:20:24] don't throw that away god vindicated it
[1:20:26] for a reason so that he would have the
[1:20:28] right to say this is the correct
[1:20:29] interpretation of that scripture
[1:20:33] is that right
[1:20:36] so we want the correct
[1:20:38] the correct interpretation of the
[1:20:39] scripture
[1:20:42] but listen without the vindication of a
[1:20:44] prophet you've got no authority to make
[1:20:46] that the correct interpretation of
[1:20:48] spirit
[1:20:51] we had to have a prophet and he had to
[1:20:52] be vindicated
[1:20:56] and he come and he taught the bible
[1:20:58] different than anybody else ever taught
[1:21:00] it
[1:21:02] and
[1:21:02] besides paul
[1:21:05] he come and he did
[1:21:07] to the denominations what paul did to
[1:21:09] the jews
[1:21:12] totally
[1:21:14] bamboozled them
[1:21:18] and look how brother ram does it he
[1:21:19] always takes the bible
[1:21:23] he says
[1:21:24] you know
[1:21:26] abraham
[1:21:27] and sarah after their visitation on the
[1:21:29] plains and memory they got a body change
[1:21:32] well how could you say something like
[1:21:33] that we'll go look next you know she's
[1:21:35] 80 something years old and she goes to
[1:21:36] the king of gerard and the king of
[1:21:38] gerard can have any virgin he wants and
[1:21:39] he wants to marry her
[1:21:42] what did brother broom do he did the
[1:21:43] same thing paul did
[1:21:45] you think it's a natural seat you think
[1:21:46] you're children of god by the flesh
[1:21:48] let's go back to j let's go back to
[1:21:50] isaac and rebecca and let's look at
[1:21:51] jacob and esau
[1:21:53] brother branham does the exact same
[1:21:55] thing
[1:21:56] so one thing i i guess i said all that
[1:21:58] to say this that brother branham is
[1:22:00] always preaching the bible
[1:22:03] don't ever don't ever let anybody else
[1:22:05] put any thought in your mind he's always
[1:22:07] preaching the bible just because you
[1:22:09] haven't seen it yet doesn't mean it's
[1:22:10] not there but he's always preaching the
[1:22:12] bible
[1:22:14] and if you'll respect that office god
[1:22:17] will open up your understanding of the
[1:22:18] bible but if you disrespect that office
[1:22:21] you're not going to see anything
[1:22:25] some will look and look and i don't see
[1:22:26] it i don't see it i don't get it it's
[1:22:28] because you won't respect what god so
[1:22:30] thoroughly vindicated
[1:22:32] you won't honor and won't respect what
[1:22:34] god sent amen you reject what god sent
[1:22:36] which was christ
[1:22:39] and you want to understand christ
[1:22:43] first you must show respect
[1:22:47] because the jews asked jesus in in john
[1:22:49] chapter 6 what must we do to do the
[1:22:51] works of god he said this is the works
[1:22:52] of god believe on him and got a sent
[1:22:57] but if you disrespect
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:00] then how will you receive the truth of
[1:23:02] the word
[1:23:04] eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:10] but the same thing's true for every
[1:23:13] every gift
[1:23:15] if you brother branham said i can only
[1:23:18] help you if you have confidence in me
[1:23:21] if you disrespect the ministry you
[1:23:23] disrespect the pastor you disrespect
[1:23:25] that amen you're not going to see
[1:23:28] you'll sit in service and say i don't
[1:23:30] understand what he's talking about i
[1:23:31] don't understand what he's talking about
[1:23:32] i don't understand what he's talking
[1:23:33] about
[1:23:36] are you respecting or disrespecting the
[1:23:38] gift that god has placed
[1:23:40] if you disrespect it you won't
[1:23:42] understand anything
[1:23:44] the church around you would be shouting
[1:23:46] amen and hallelujah be sitting there
[1:23:47] like i don't understand what he's saying
[1:23:50] because you have to respect the office
[1:23:52] of a prophet
[1:23:54] to receive the understanding and
[1:23:56] revelation that god sent through that
[1:23:58] prophet
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:03] hebrews chapter 6
[1:24:06] verse 13
[1:24:11] for when god made a promise to abraham
[1:24:13] because
[1:24:14] he could swear by no greater he swerved
[1:24:16] by himself
[1:24:18] praise god
[1:24:21] let's think about this for a minute
[1:24:23] for when god made a promise to abraham i
[1:24:25] want to ask you a question
[1:24:26] when god made a promise to abraham
[1:24:29] where's your promise
[1:24:32] where's your promise
[1:24:34] your promise is what he promised abraham
[1:24:37] are you promised to be heir of the world
[1:24:39] absolutely all the promises of abraham
[1:24:41] are for abraham's seed so when god made
[1:24:44] made a promise to abraham
[1:24:47] which also applies to abraham's seed
[1:24:49] which applies to me
[1:24:52] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:24:54] swear by himself
[1:24:56] my promise god swore by by himself amen
[1:24:59] he's promised to confirm it he's
[1:25:01] promised to stand by it he's promised to
[1:25:04] uphold it
[1:25:05] he swore by the greatest that could be
[1:25:07] swore by he swore by himself because
[1:25:10] there was none greater
[1:25:12] verse 14 saying surely
[1:25:14] surely blessing i will bless thee and
[1:25:17] multiplying i will multiply thee and so
[1:25:20] after he had patiently endured he
[1:25:22] obtained
[1:25:23] the promise
[1:25:25] amen i'm going to keep reading no i'm
[1:25:27] not going to keep reading
[1:25:29] no yeah i am going to keep reading
[1:25:31] after efficiently and dirty obtain the
[1:25:32] promise for men verily swear by the
[1:25:34] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[1:25:37] to them an end of all strife so an oath
[1:25:40] of confirmation once it's confirmed with
[1:25:42] an oath there's no more arguing it's
[1:25:43] settled
[1:25:44] that's what this is saying
[1:25:46] this this promise to abraham and his
[1:25:49] seed is settled it's settled by a
[1:25:51] promise god made which is his word and
[1:25:53] it's settled by an oath that he bound
[1:25:55] himself by an oath to this promise
[1:26:00] for the for an oath
[1:26:02] for confirmation is to them an end of
[1:26:04] all strife wherein god willing more
[1:26:06] abundantly to show into the heirs of
[1:26:08] promise the immutability
[1:26:09] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:26:12] by an oath
[1:26:14] that by two immutable things his promise
[1:26:17] and his oath his word and his oath by
[1:26:21] two immutable things
[1:26:23] that means immutable is impossible to
[1:26:25] change
[1:26:27] unchanging
[1:26:29] by two immutable things in which it was
[1:26:31] impossible for god to lie we might have
[1:26:33] a strong consolation with fled for
[1:26:35] refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:26:38] before us
[1:26:41] paul
[1:26:42] now hang on to this that we just read
[1:26:46] i'll read it again and then i want to
[1:26:47] make another statement for by two
[1:26:49] immutable things in which it was
[1:26:50] impossible for god to lie
[1:26:52] we might have strong consolation he
[1:26:56] started this off by saying when god made
[1:26:59] a promise to abraham and now he's
[1:27:01] talking about our consolation because
[1:27:03] our consolation is in abraham's promise
[1:27:06] abraham's promise has come to us
[1:27:08] according to paul so now he starts off
[1:27:11] this by saying for when god made a
[1:27:13] promise to abraham now he talks about
[1:27:16] god's word and god's oath and now he
[1:27:18] says that's our assurance
[1:27:22] now we might have strong consolation
[1:27:23] with fled for refuge to lay hold upon
[1:27:26] hope set before us which hope we have as
[1:27:28] an anchor of the soul both sure and
[1:27:30] steadfast which entereth into that
[1:27:33] within the veil whether the forerunner
[1:27:35] is for us entered even jesus made a high
[1:27:37] priest forever after the order
[1:27:40] of melchizedek
[1:27:43] amen jesus
[1:27:45] paul tells us
[1:27:46] that when god made this promise to
[1:27:48] abraham's seed which also comes to us
[1:27:51] because he could swear by none greater
[1:27:53] he swore by himself
[1:27:56] that means for the promise not to come
[1:27:58] upon you god would have to destroy
[1:28:01] himself or something i don't know what
[1:28:02] that means
[1:28:03] and god can't be destroyed god can't
[1:28:05] vanish the way god nothing can change in
[1:28:08] god so the promise is so sure to you
[1:28:11] it's as sure as god is sure god made it
[1:28:14] sure by himself
[1:28:17] so when you make something sure you make
[1:28:18] a a deposit or you become a surety for
[1:28:21] somebody you co-sign for something what
[1:28:23] you're doing is you're promising that if
[1:28:24] they can't make the obligation i will
[1:28:27] you become surety
[1:28:29] well god because he could swear by no
[1:28:31] matter he became sure to himself upon
[1:28:33] himself amen so the promise cannot fade
[1:28:36] away as long as god exists
[1:28:38] god would have to cease to exist for the
[1:28:41] promise to abraham to fade away that's
[1:28:43] how sure the promise is to you and i
[1:28:46] friends
[1:28:48] it is not changing it is immutable it is
[1:28:51] not fading away it is not going anywhere
[1:28:54] i am under the promise i'm to be a
[1:28:56] blessing amen and all that blessed this
[1:28:58] word made manifest will be blessed and
[1:28:59] all that curse it will be cursed
[1:29:02] why because it's the manifestation of
[1:29:04] the word of god coming down through
[1:29:06] which is what the lamb's book of life
[1:29:12] amen
[1:29:13] i want to read here in the smyrnan
[1:29:14] church age
[1:29:17] i'm doing a horrible one time
[1:29:21] god loves me anyways i'm sure of it
[1:29:24] we're not going to go much longer but i
[1:29:26] just want to lay in a few more pieces
[1:29:28] here
[1:29:30] in the smyrnan church age from the
[1:29:31] church age book the prophet of god says
[1:29:33] according to romans 4 16 we find that
[1:29:35] god has given a sure promise to all of
[1:29:38] abraham seed
[1:29:40] and paul puts himself in all believers
[1:29:42] under that designation because he says
[1:29:44] abraham who is the father of us all
[1:29:48] then he goes on and not only
[1:29:50] and and not only narrowed down his
[1:29:52] definition but rather to finalize it for
[1:29:54] in galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:29:57] singular with jesus and counted the seed
[1:30:00] children as children of the promise and
[1:30:02] promises of having to do with election
[1:30:05] are the choosing of god
[1:30:07] and that is exactly what we have been
[1:30:09] saying those who are the royal seed or
[1:30:11] the elect of god are the predestinated
[1:30:14] foreknown of god and we're in the mind
[1:30:17] of god and his thoughts
[1:30:19] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:30:21] christ was in the mind of god eternally
[1:30:24] though not expressed until each came
[1:30:26] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:30:29] as each member came forth it became
[1:30:32] expressed and it took its place in the
[1:30:34] body
[1:30:35] thus the bride is the lit is the literal
[1:30:38] spoken word seed bride and though she is
[1:30:41] feminine in designation she is also
[1:30:44] called the body of christ
[1:30:46] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:30:48] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:30:50] him
[1:30:51] came from the same source was eternal
[1:30:53] with him and is now manifesting god in a
[1:30:56] many-membered body whereas once god was
[1:30:59] manifest in one member even our lord
[1:31:01] jesus christ
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:07] i'm going to try to
[1:31:09] explain
[1:31:10] what's on my heart
[1:31:14] god
[1:31:15] through the old testament
[1:31:17] was rebuilding his masterpiece
[1:31:21] had fallen in the garden of eden
[1:31:24] and in that masterpiece first he had to
[1:31:25] get the man back so he had to get the
[1:31:27] last adam
[1:31:29] he had to restore fallen adams so he
[1:31:32] begins working right away and he comes
[1:31:34] down through the old testament and he's
[1:31:36] building back the image of the man and
[1:31:38] he's using no one he's using moses and
[1:31:40] he's using the judges he's using david
[1:31:43] he's using all of this amen that's why
[1:31:45] you can go back to those stories and you
[1:31:47] can find the new testament in those
[1:31:48] stories
[1:31:50] because he's building back the image
[1:31:52] because because listen when god when god
[1:31:56] created adam he first created him in
[1:31:58] spirit form and in spirit form he was
[1:32:00] both male and female
[1:32:02] now we we we get this so many times and
[1:32:05] we say yep adam male and female but you
[1:32:07] realize what god was doing was he was
[1:32:09] demonstrating the seventh seal he was
[1:32:11] trying to get us to understand the rest
[1:32:13] of the bible
[1:32:15] so when when christ amen is manifest
[1:32:18] he's male and female
[1:32:20] in spirit form
[1:32:22] so adam was taken and he was formed into
[1:32:25] a body amen out of the out of the dust
[1:32:28] of the earth was created a body amen and
[1:32:30] that life went into that body and that
[1:32:32] was a son of god it was a created son of
[1:32:34] god
[1:32:36] and that son of god had within him his
[1:32:39] female expression
[1:32:41] now listen i don't want to say eve was
[1:32:44] in adam
[1:32:45] it wouldn't be wrong to say that but it
[1:32:47] brings the wrong image to your mind
[1:32:51] the female portion of adam was in adam
[1:32:56] it was adam singular
[1:32:59] and adam was
[1:33:00] the blend of feminist and masculine
[1:33:03] together
[1:33:04] it was one
[1:33:06] and god brought that forth but in due
[1:33:08] time he would he would need a help meet
[1:33:12] because he's foreshadowing something
[1:33:14] he's showing what was in the mind of god
[1:33:15] he's showing what was always in god's
[1:33:17] mind and he's foreshadowing what's going
[1:33:19] to be coming down through time
[1:33:21] and so he brings a piece of adam
[1:33:25] part of his flesh the word
[1:33:27] and he forms the woman and he splits
[1:33:30] that spirit and brings the feminist
[1:33:32] spirit of adam
[1:33:34] not eve
[1:33:37] the feminist spirit of adam over and
[1:33:40] places it in this vessel and he calls
[1:33:43] their name adam male and female
[1:33:47] so
[1:33:48] so i'm going to say this
[1:33:52] oh the best way i know how
[1:33:56] god
[1:34:00] was not forming adam
[1:34:02] and then forming eve
[1:34:07] god formed adam
[1:34:10] and by the spirit of god adam became the
[1:34:13] woman
[1:34:21] he became by the moving of god amen by
[1:34:24] god's spirit and god's work he became
[1:34:28] the woman
[1:34:29] adam
[1:34:36] she didn't get a name until she
[1:34:38] until she left her husband
[1:34:40] and committed adultery then she received
[1:34:42] the name
[1:34:44] before that she didn't need a name her
[1:34:46] name was adam she was a further
[1:34:48] expression of adam she was adam being
[1:34:51] formed into female so it was adam and
[1:34:54] singular male and female then adam
[1:34:56] formed into female now you have adam
[1:34:58] male and female united as one which is
[1:35:01] adam
[1:35:01] [Applause]
[1:35:03] so the old testament is bringing back
[1:35:05] adam but in that last atom is male and
[1:35:09] female
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:13] this is why brother bran he's so clear
[1:35:15] on this because he can see it laying in
[1:35:16] genesis he said this seven seal was
[1:35:18] spoke of all the way back in the
[1:35:20] beginning in genesis
[1:35:22] it's laying right there amen so in jesus
[1:35:25] christ was his bride
[1:35:30] at calvary amen amen he was smote in the
[1:35:33] side under his ribs by a spirit and out
[1:35:35] came the ingredients for his bride amen
[1:35:38] in the spirit returned on the day of
[1:35:39] pentecost and now that bride's being
[1:35:41] formed out of the word because he was
[1:35:42] the word made flesh
[1:35:45] and the life of christ the life of the
[1:35:46] word is now making the woman amen and so
[1:35:50] this is not eve this is jesus christ
[1:35:54] forming himself into a bride amen
[1:36:04] i'm just gonna say that's the truth
[1:36:08] we believe it or we don't believe it but
[1:36:10] it's the truth we believe it
[1:36:14] and so
[1:36:16] if i could
[1:36:17] i just wish i had better language
[1:36:21] but it doesn't take language anyways it
[1:36:22] takes revelation
[1:36:26] as
[1:36:27] god was rebuilding the masterpiece
[1:36:30] he was sending the life of christ as he
[1:36:33] sent the word down
[1:36:36] right
[1:36:37] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:36:40] and the word was with god and the word
[1:36:42] was god
[1:36:44] all right same was in the beginning with
[1:36:46] god
[1:36:47] and in him was life and that life was
[1:36:49] the light of men
[1:36:51] we got that
[1:36:53] so that was the word and as the word
[1:36:55] came down to express a portion in each
[1:36:58] age
[1:36:59] that word was christ
[1:37:03] and when christ is expressing god's
[1:37:05] rebuilding the masterpiece
[1:37:07] and as that word is expressing
[1:37:10] life is in that word so as that word's
[1:37:13] expressing god is manifesting the book
[1:37:16] of life the lamb's book of life
[1:37:19] it's coming into manifestation step by
[1:37:21] step and all of this was building back
[1:37:24] to the image of the man and life was
[1:37:27] there
[1:37:30] and then
[1:37:32] all of that life
[1:37:34] wrapped up into one vessel when john 1
[1:37:37] 14 says and the word was made flesh and
[1:37:39] dwelt among us now all of that word that
[1:37:42] was expressed in each day is now flesh
[1:37:45] and brother branham says you were in him
[1:37:48] when he went to calvary
[1:37:51] because if you were the thought of god
[1:37:54] that was the word that portion of the
[1:37:56] thought of god that became word when
[1:37:58] that word came forth it was christ and
[1:38:00] you were in there because your word
[1:38:04] you're part of the word as the word
[1:38:06] expressed you were there
[1:38:10] listen
[1:38:11] brother branham says you were there
[1:38:14] when moses opened the red sea i mean i
[1:38:16] mean i have all the terms right but you
[1:38:17] were there when he did this you were
[1:38:19] there you were there why because that
[1:38:22] same life of that word is in me now and
[1:38:25] that life was there then that life is
[1:38:28] here now and i was there
[1:38:32] how well way what do you remember i
[1:38:34] don't know i can't tell you the details
[1:38:36] i don't know what color moses was
[1:38:38] wearing when he stood up and and rested
[1:38:41] his rod and split the red sea amen but
[1:38:43] there's something in me now that was
[1:38:45] there then
[1:38:48] that's why i can receive the word
[1:38:51] so
[1:38:52] so
[1:38:53] as let me come back here to the old
[1:38:55] testament
[1:38:59] noah's expressing
[1:39:01] moses is expressing
[1:39:03] joshua's expressing
[1:39:05] the judges are expressing
[1:39:08] what are they expressing
[1:39:11] it is it is christ becoming manifest
[1:39:16] is that right
[1:39:18] it's the word becoming manifest it's
[1:39:20] christ becoming manifest it's the seed
[1:39:22] of abraham moving down through
[1:39:26] it's the manifesting of the lamb's book
[1:39:28] of life it's it's all of those things
[1:39:31] all coming up so it was it was forming
[1:39:34] christ
[1:39:36] and the capping of it all was when he
[1:39:38] came down in full measure now not a
[1:39:39] portion but now the fullness
[1:39:43] and i was there
[1:39:46] now when we come over to the new
[1:39:48] testament
[1:39:49] it comes out in first aid second age all
[1:39:51] of this what's it doing now now it's
[1:39:54] building an image
[1:39:56] of a bride
[1:40:00] but is it a different life or is it the
[1:40:02] same life
[1:40:04] is it a different word under a different
[1:40:05] promise or is it the same word with the
[1:40:07] same promise amen
[1:40:09] it was if i was there he's here
[1:40:18] so now the life of christ that seed as
[1:40:21] is coming down with the promise of
[1:40:23] abraham that seed is moving down through
[1:40:26] and now that same life that same word
[1:40:29] that was in the thought of god that was
[1:40:31] spoken the word that was with god the
[1:40:32] word that was god amen that word is now
[1:40:36] amen coming into expression in the in
[1:40:39] the fourth church age and the fifth
[1:40:40] church age and the sixth third day
[1:40:42] finally till comes back to be capped
[1:40:44] again and the capping off that full life
[1:40:46] of christ returns back
[1:40:49] but it doesn't return back in the same
[1:40:52] physical image as it was when the full
[1:40:54] capstone came down there this is the
[1:40:56] capping by the headship christ returning
[1:40:58] back the fullness of the word with the
[1:41:00] fullness of the life coming back and
[1:41:02] it's in the image of a mini-membered
[1:41:04] bride
[1:41:08] but down through the church ages what
[1:41:10] was happening
[1:41:12] it was christ
[1:41:14] forming himself into a bride
[1:41:19] now why'd you explain all that brother
[1:41:21] chad
[1:41:22] because any place that christ is being
[1:41:25] expressed now do we all believe that
[1:41:27] that was christ
[1:41:29] are we thoroughly convinced that that
[1:41:31] was the word
[1:41:33] and christ is the anointed word for that
[1:41:35] day made manifest
[1:41:38] so every day
[1:41:39] that was present tense word made
[1:41:41] manifest that was christ
[1:41:44] all right and christ is that word which
[1:41:47] is the life which is the light
[1:41:51] oh there
[1:41:53] so now
[1:41:55] that word is there for a blessing
[1:42:00] to bless that you receive a blessing to
[1:42:02] curse it you receive a curse
[1:42:06] all those that are part of that life
[1:42:08] they recognize that life they become one
[1:42:10] with that life and now they're the
[1:42:11] expression of that life
[1:42:15] and that's how
[1:42:16] you can see that it wasn't just
[1:42:19] adam and then eve it was adam and adam
[1:42:24] and this is not christ and the bride
[1:42:27] it's christ and christ
[1:42:32] that's why to reject luther's message
[1:42:35] was to reject life in your day
[1:42:38] because luther was he his message was
[1:42:40] christ the anointed word for that day
[1:42:43] made manifest
[1:42:45] so it's always the same thing over and
[1:42:47] over and over again
[1:42:49] so we want to catch that
[1:42:51] now
[1:42:53] that's why he says
[1:42:55] in the smyrna church age
[1:42:57] each came forth in the designated decree
[1:42:59] season and each member came forth it
[1:43:01] became expressed and took its place in
[1:43:03] the body thus the bride is the literal
[1:43:06] spoken word seed bride
[1:43:09] and though she is feminine in
[1:43:11] designation she is also called the body
[1:43:14] of christ
[1:43:15] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:43:17] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:43:19] him
[1:43:20] came from the same source
[1:43:22] was eternal with him and is now
[1:43:25] manifesting god in a many-membered body
[1:43:28] whereas once god was manifested in one
[1:43:30] member even our lord jesus christ
[1:43:35] let's go to hebrews chapter 2.
[1:43:44] hebrews chapter 2
[1:43:46] verse 10.
[1:43:51] hebrews 2 and 10 for it became him
[1:43:54] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:43:56] all things okay
[1:43:59] who is that
[1:44:01] that's the word
[1:44:03] right
[1:44:05] if you go back to john 1 1 in the
[1:44:07] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:44:08] with god and the word was god
[1:44:10] all things were made by him without him
[1:44:12] was not anything made that was made
[1:44:14] all right we got that
[1:44:16] so let's read this for it became him for
[1:44:18] whom all who for whom are all things and
[1:44:20] by whom are all things this is the word
[1:44:23] which is christ
[1:44:25] things in bringing many sons into glory
[1:44:27] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:44:29] perfect through suffering
[1:44:31] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:44:34] who are sanctified are all of one
[1:44:39] he who's doing the sanctifying and you
[1:44:41] who's being sanctified you're all of one
[1:44:44] you're all of christ you're all part of
[1:44:46] that worm for which cause he is not
[1:44:48] ashamed to call them brethren saying i
[1:44:50] will declare thy name unto my brethren
[1:44:52] in the midst of the church will i sing
[1:44:54] praises unto thee and again i will put
[1:44:56] my trust in him and again behold i and
[1:44:59] the children which god hath given me for
[1:45:02] as much then as the children are
[1:45:03] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[1:45:05] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:45:08] that through death he might destroy him
[1:45:09] that had the power of death that is the
[1:45:11] devil and deliver them
[1:45:14] who through fear of death were all their
[1:45:16] lifetimes subject to bondage for verily
[1:45:18] he took not on him the nature of angels
[1:45:20] but he took on him the seed of abraham
[1:45:25] praise
[1:45:27] be
[1:45:28] to god
[1:45:32] i'm going to stop
[1:45:33] there's way too much
[1:45:36] but i want to say
[1:45:38] don't miss
[1:45:39] what god's doing
[1:45:42] don't miss and don't miss the promise
[1:45:46] that is on your life
[1:45:49] listen
[1:45:50] the promise that was on jacob's life was
[1:45:52] the promise of abraham came to jacob
[1:45:55] jacob could look at his mistakes
[1:45:58] his failures his shortcomings and never
[1:46:01] be able to receive that promise
[1:46:04] but see it was independent of his
[1:46:07] failure his mistakes and his
[1:46:08] shortcomings
[1:46:10] it was based on the foreknowledge and
[1:46:11] election of god
[1:46:13] but when when god called jacob and he
[1:46:17] changed him to israel and israel went
[1:46:19] through his chains he became a blessing
[1:46:22] to all nations
[1:46:25] and that's what he was here for because
[1:46:26] he was to manifest christ he was to
[1:46:28] manifest the word which the word is the
[1:46:30] blessing to all
[1:46:32] and so now we come by election by god's
[1:46:36] foreign nation it wasn't listen it
[1:46:38] wasn't jacob's flesh that was so special
[1:46:41] it was the predetermined counsel of god
[1:46:44] that this flesh would contain a life
[1:46:46] that would manifest me
[1:46:48] and when it comes to us it's not our
[1:46:51] flesh that's so special other than it's
[1:46:53] being ordained by god before the
[1:46:55] foundation of the world to house a life
[1:46:57] and that life will be quickened by the
[1:46:58] spirit of god and that manifestation
[1:47:01] will be the manifestation of the
[1:47:02] anointed word for this day
[1:47:05] and that is here to be a blessing amen
[1:47:08] and to be part of the seed of abraham to
[1:47:10] receive the promises of god and now we
[1:47:13] understand now there's a seed of abraham
[1:47:16] coming through which is also
[1:47:18] speaking of the lamb's book of life
[1:47:23] but that lamb's book of life is here to
[1:47:25] be a blessing
[1:47:28] remember we were talking about
[1:47:31] uh wednesday
[1:47:33] that those all around that life
[1:47:37] who blessed that life
[1:47:40] were part
[1:47:41] of the book of life
[1:47:43] and received life why because that life
[1:47:47] was a blessing
[1:47:49] but those who cursed that life
[1:47:52] became cursed at the white throne
[1:47:54] judgment
[1:47:56] remember the white throne judgment
[1:47:57] matthew 25 when he separates them as he
[1:47:59] separates sheep from goats and he says
[1:48:02] to the sheep or to the ones on the right
[1:48:03] hand because you fed me when i was naked
[1:48:06] you clothed me and when i was naked fed
[1:48:08] me when i was poor visiting me in prison
[1:48:10] because you did this to me and they said
[1:48:12] lord when did we do it to you
[1:48:15] he said when you did it to the seed of
[1:48:17] abraham
[1:48:19] brother chad you're misquoting the
[1:48:20] scriptures i'm saying the same thing
[1:48:24] when you did it to the seed of abraham
[1:48:26] you did it to me
[1:48:31] to the ones on the left hand because you
[1:48:34] didn't feed me you didn't do this you
[1:48:36] didn't do that
[1:48:39] you go into eternal judgment
[1:48:41] they say lord when did we see you and
[1:48:43] not and see you and not
[1:48:45] and he said when you did it not to the
[1:48:47] least of these seed of abraham
[1:48:51] you did it not unto me
[1:48:54] and that is the scene
[1:48:56] of the white throne judgment
[1:49:00] and i see
[1:49:02] that blessing
[1:49:04] that blessing
[1:49:06] is as sure as god is sure
[1:49:09] because god has confirmed it with an
[1:49:11] oath the blessing to abraham
[1:49:16] god is going to stand by it at the white
[1:49:19] throne judgment
[1:49:21] and we are here this manifestation of
[1:49:24] the word is here to be a
[1:49:26] blessing if it brings a curse it's
[1:49:30] because somebody refused it and hated it
[1:49:32] and didn't love it
[1:49:34] but it came to be a blessing
[1:49:37] everywhere abraham went was a blessing
[1:49:39] if they would receive abraham
[1:49:42] if they cursed abraham or did wrong to
[1:49:43] abraham it became a curse to them but if
[1:49:45] they would bless abraham it became a
[1:49:47] blessing to them
[1:49:49] and that same promise is coming down
[1:49:51] through and thank god there's still seed
[1:49:54] of abraham on this earth
[1:49:57] because when there is no longer seed of
[1:49:59] abraham on this earth it's going to be a
[1:50:01] bad thing for this world
[1:50:03] but we're here with a promise and that
[1:50:05] promise is just sure as god is sure
[1:50:09] i want to live my life
[1:50:11] under the promise of abraham
[1:50:14] and i want to live my life under the
[1:50:16] blessing of abraham
[1:50:18] oh there's so much more i want to get to
[1:50:20] but you pray for me
[1:50:22] and we'll come back wednesday let's all
[1:50:24] stand
[1:50:25] musicians if you could come
[1:50:30] i don't think we could ever fully grasp
[1:50:32] how blessed we are
[1:50:34] i don't think we could ever fully
[1:50:35] comprehend or maybe we are beginning to
[1:50:37] comprehend and maybe there will come
[1:50:39] greater comprehension as the days go by
[1:50:41] but oh i want to see amen i want to if i
[1:50:45] could see me the way god sees me i would
[1:50:47] never struggle again
[1:50:50] we could see how sure our position is
[1:50:52] and how sure the blessing is and how
[1:50:55] sure the promise is i don't think we
[1:50:57] would sweat it near as much as we sweat
[1:50:59] it i think our levels of anxiety would
[1:51:01] come down when we see how solid and sure
[1:51:03] this promise is to abraham see
[1:51:07] the real question is is do you have
[1:51:08] faith to believe your abraham's seed
[1:51:11] because we shouldn't be in doubt of the
[1:51:13] promise and we shouldn't be in doubt of
[1:51:14] the blessings because god has made those
[1:51:16] sure so we can't be in doubt of that the
[1:51:19] devil will try to make you doubt whether
[1:51:20] or not you're abraham's seed or not
[1:51:23] but i say shake off the devil and take
[1:51:26] the word amen and believe the word and
[1:51:28] say i am a child of god amen by faith
[1:51:31] that god has planted in my heart i
[1:51:32] believe this word
[1:51:34] i believe it to the core of who i am and
[1:51:36] i am part of that christ seed
[1:51:39] [Applause]
[1:51:41] and i want to live like it act like it
[1:51:43] talk like it pray like it
[1:51:46] i want to live with the revelation of
[1:51:50] who i am
[1:51:52] let us bow our heads and pray
[1:51:55] lord jesus we thank you for your
[1:51:57] goodness lord for your word that is so
[1:51:59] solid
[1:52:00] so sure
[1:52:02] god i so thankful lord for
[1:52:06] you lord as you wrote your bible and you
[1:52:08] brought it down to the apostle paul
[1:52:11] and he caught the revelation lord of the
[1:52:13] spiritual seed of abraham the christ
[1:52:15] seed
[1:52:17] well now you sent a prophet in this day
[1:52:19] to take us back to what paul taught
[1:52:22] so that we would understand lord that
[1:52:24] it's not by merit but it's by election
[1:52:28] and that election is planted within us a
[1:52:30] seat of faith for by grace we are saved
[1:52:33] through faith and that not of ourselves
[1:52:34] it's your gift you've given us lord
[1:52:38] and here we are your children by faith
[1:52:40] here we are under the promise and under
[1:52:42] the blessing of abraham because you've
[1:52:44] given us a seed of faith to believe
[1:52:48] god we just want to raise our hands to
[1:52:50] you and say thank you god
[1:52:52] we love you father because we could have
[1:52:54] never done this on our own but you did
[1:52:56] it lord you did it before the foundation
[1:52:58] of the world and they are opening our
[1:53:00] eyes to see how sure the promise is
[1:53:03] and what we're here for
[1:53:06] god take us into your hands and use us
[1:53:08] for your glory
