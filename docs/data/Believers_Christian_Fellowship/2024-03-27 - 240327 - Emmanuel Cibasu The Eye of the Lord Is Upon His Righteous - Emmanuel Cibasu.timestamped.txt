[11:35] evening do you know there's only one
[11:37] group of people that can give him praise
[11:40] we will read it there's only one group
[11:44] of people that can praise
[11:46] him and that's you A peculiar people A
[11:51] peculiar treasure you are his his own
[11:55] inheritance God bless you you may be
[11:58] seated thank you brothers and sisters
[12:01] appreciate your gifts days in and days
[12:05] out they are here ministering to us and
[12:08] we just want to appreciate all that they
[12:12] do well God bless you all
[12:15] again I have uh the
[12:20] opportunity to be today here to announce
[12:24] that our pastor is on his way
[12:26] back this is what the services all about
[12:30] all the ministers have to preach and the
[12:32] only one has to announce that our pastor
[12:35] is coming back and that was
[12:37] me so he he's sending his greetings to
[12:40] you all and him and uh with uh his uh
[12:46] precious
[12:48] beautiful beloved blessed two companions
[12:53] I'm glad they were not sitting there
[12:54] because they would have
[12:56] been
[12:58] shrinking
[12:59] so an hour ago they were to board the
[13:02] their first flight headed back to the us
[13:07] and we're just so blessed that our
[13:11] pastor is coming back home with the
[13:13] family and uh meeting his family here
[13:17] that has been so precious to us uh we
[13:19] don't want them to shrink right now we
[13:21] had too many things to say but we're
[13:22] want to hold
[13:24] that we just appreciate everyone here is
[13:29] for years just think that for years the
[13:32] denomination used to say when the poly
[13:35] Ghost came on the day of the Pentecost
[13:38] the Pentecost God was dividing himself
[13:41] but here comes the prophet at the end
[13:43] time he said no it's the
[13:45] opposite it's God reuniting himself and
[13:48] I'm seeing here God reuniting himself
[13:52] there's some toes sitting somewhere some
[13:54] hands sitting there and some tongues
[13:57] there so we are one body
[14:00] we have come to minister to one another
[14:02] just to just to love him I don't have
[14:06] something special we just going to be
[14:07] reading uh the scripture today so beside
[14:11] the greetings from our pastor I also
[14:13] have greetings from uh brothers and
[14:16] sisters uh from Fresno California where
[14:19] we were uh visiting last
[14:22] weekend they uh send their greetings to
[14:25] you and say that they know you
[14:30] they feel like they're they are part of
[14:32] the congregation and uh Brother Rich cob
[14:36] is the one who is very instrumental
[14:38] there towards them and uh he provided
[14:43] that we were able to make there and just
[14:45] to be a blessing to them so they're
[14:46] sending their G greetings to you and I'm
[14:49] pretty sure they're probably watching
[14:50] the uh stream a lot
[14:52] BCF and so those are my announcement
[14:56] let's stand up and read the word of God
[14:59] and just relax and let me relax too so
[15:04] if if um if if it's just
[15:08] uh if it's lengthy we're going to stop
[15:11] it somewhere because by uh 8:30 so I
[15:16] start to become
[15:17] nervous so so we can we can get it out
[15:21] of the way the scripture is in the book
[15:24] of
[15:25] [Music]
[15:27] Psalm chapter
[15:30] 33 it's a familiar
[15:34] scripture and we're going to just
[15:38] be just rehearsing what we we
[15:42] know and just to see the goodness of Our
[15:50] Lord 33 and we can start at verse
[15:56] 12 and it says blessed is the nation
[16:01] whose God is the Lord and the people
[16:05] whom he hath chosen for his own
[16:10] inheritance wow that's a mouthful there
[16:14] but we won't be speaking on that so
[16:15] we're going to be going down there
[16:17] because that could take probably 100 of
[16:20] years just to dissect about his own
[16:24] inheritance there 13 says the Lord look
[16:28] look from Heaven he beholdeth all the
[16:31] sons of man from the place of his
[16:35] habitation he lookth upon all the
[16:38] inhabitants of the earth he fashion
[16:41] their hearts alike he consider all their
[16:46] works there's no King saved by the
[16:50] multitude of an
[16:52] host a mighty man is not delivered by
[16:56] much strength and horse is is a vain
[17:00] thing for
[17:02] safety neither shall he deliver any by
[17:06] his great strength behold the eye of the
[17:10] Lord is upon them that fear Him upon
[17:14] them that hope in his Mercy to deliver
[17:17] their soul from death and to keep them
[17:21] alive in famine let's have a word of
[17:24] prayer
[17:26] together precious Heavenly Father
[17:30] father we have again approached this
[17:34] moment that every Mortal
[17:37] father takes a step
[17:40] back to behold what you are about to
[17:45] say sometimes you can speak in little
[17:48] small
[17:50] voice some something just so
[17:54] simple but you know how to plunge it
[17:57] into our heart
[18:00] and father as we have come this evening
[18:03] we are that blessed
[18:06] nation that blessed the inheritance of
[18:09] yours because we know that you have
[18:12] purchased us through the blood of your
[18:14] begotten son our Lord Jesus Christ
[18:17] father we were unworthy we were not even
[18:21] called of of of you but now we can call
[18:24] you father and thank you for giving us
[18:27] that grandest opportunity that the
[18:30] Mortal cannot give to anyone as we have
[18:33] come father we cannot approach you
[18:36] without asking for you you to forgive us
[18:39] our our mistakes and
[18:41] shortcoming father we have seen Lord in
[18:44] all these messages father have been
[18:46] coming through Lord for the two months
[18:49] here not only you have given us your
[18:51] precious message but father you are now
[18:54] dealing with our
[18:57] hearts to hold this blessedness of the
[19:00] Lord in our heart cleanse us father from
[19:03] inside out and Lord and as we have come
[19:07] we just to want to appreciate to you for
[19:11] all that you do for
[19:13] us how you have Lord put a group of
[19:17] people here each
[19:19] individual loving you with a special
[19:23] love father I know that you see each and
[19:26] every one of us here
[19:29] Lord thank you for ordaining us to life
[19:34] for putting something inside each and
[19:37] everyone that can father love you that
[19:39] can look towards you alone and father as
[19:43] we have come we know that you will not
[19:46] Lord turn us
[19:48] hungry we're now thanking you for
[19:50] blessing our pastor and his daughters on
[19:54] a trip far away Lord to the end of the
[19:57] world and Lord you have used him Lord to
[20:01] fulfill your Great
[20:03] Commission men were to do it and father
[20:07] you allowed and ordained that my brother
[20:11] our pastor and his daughters could be
[20:14] there to be used of you and you did that
[20:18] now they are on their way home and
[20:21] father maybe with the the the lapse in
[20:24] in the time we just ask that you will
[20:26] give them traveling Mercies
[20:29] and father that you will give renew
[20:31] their strength as they come back and
[20:34] father as Lord as they come we are
[20:36] anticipating a testimony a report to
[20:40] know what you are doing among your
[20:42] children because we heard the great news
[20:46] that you are the same yesterday today
[20:49] and forever and we know that you are you
[20:52] were there to do what you always know
[20:56] how to do better than anyone else know
[20:58] know we ask now father that you will be
[21:01] with us here as we open the scripture
[21:04] that you'll give us a thought that you
[21:06] Lord you put me aside and just Lord let
[21:09] me be a conduit that Lord I can you can
[21:12] use me to say something that would
[21:14] encourage someone this evening that
[21:16] you'll prepare the hearts of your
[21:18] beloved children father just to receive
[21:20] it father to glorify your name we're
[21:23] here for one purpose everything is for
[21:25] you looking up to you you created us
[21:28] just for you and there's no one who
[21:30] would take any credit for anything we
[21:32] love you father we thank you bless now
[21:34] your word in Jesus Christ name we pray
[21:37] amen you may be
[21:42] seated praise be to his name I'm pulling
[21:45] up
[21:47] uh I was as I was back there you know
[21:50] you can come back there you preparing
[21:53] May putting some scriptures together and
[21:56] then something comes up before you just
[21:58] want to
[22:00] just put it out you might not even cope
[22:03] with the line of your what you were
[22:04] about to talk but this is so tremendous
[22:07] that in this time just think that God is
[22:12] not wasting any second on
[22:16] you he's not resting yet he will rest
[22:21] remember that the only time in the Book
[22:23] of Genesis when God could take his rest
[22:27] it was when that image was standing
[22:31] there on
[22:32] Earth image both male and female in
[22:36] Perfection then God took a rest as long
[22:40] as you and I we have not reached that
[22:42] what we've been ordained to he is
[22:46] working on you every
[22:50] second even things that you think that
[22:53] these are hindrance this is just killing
[22:56] me this is just you know what
[22:59] it is perfectly working before
[23:02] God perfectly working before God he say
[23:06] that before Jesus could be born he was
[23:09] the king who gave
[23:10] a degree decree there that you have to
[23:14] go be back in your hometown to to to
[23:16] give
[23:17] tax people said this is Harsh great
[23:21] Jehovah in heaven is said he's just
[23:23] fulfilling my purpose on Earth he has to
[23:25] be born there back there in Bethlehem
[23:29] so the the the clock is just taking on
[23:33] time the only thing we need and that's
[23:36] probably the title of our
[23:39] uh sermon this evening the eye of the
[23:45] Lord once you have that eye because he
[23:49] will give you a permission to look
[23:50] through
[23:51] it once you get to look through that
[23:55] eye things change amen amen
[24:00] amen the eye of the Lord is upon them
[24:05] that fear
[24:07] him so there there was a little secret
[24:11] there to tap into that eye
[24:14] amen it requires fear the fear of the
[24:20] Lord now just think that the prophet of
[24:23] God said he's gone to prepare a
[24:26] place prepare
[24:28] place you we think might be doing up
[24:31] there he's preparing that place right
[24:36] now through you and me he's preparing
[24:39] his own place inside of that body that
[24:42] you are there he playing preparing that
[24:45] that place there he said he's gone to
[24:47] prepare a place a perfect place where no
[24:51] evil
[24:55] exists perfect place no sickness
[25:00] exists no old age exists no death
[25:05] exists it's a perfect place calling you
[25:09] to that
[25:11] Perfection and you have to be perfect to
[25:14] get
[25:16] there you have to be perfect to get
[25:20] there our start here was already
[25:24] imperfect right where you where are you
[25:27] going to start from
[25:30] yes something has to happen yeah
[25:35] amen and he said the Bible said so Jesus
[25:39] said be there perfect even as your
[25:42] father in Heaven is
[25:45] perfect wow it's a perfect
[25:53] Kingdom God is not calling us to be an
[25:56] average believer
[25:59] yes average Believers were in seven
[26:02] Church ages amen they were fine there
[26:05] yeah fine and Justified checked out an
[26:08] average
[26:09] believer this group of people this is
[26:13] not an average
[26:15] believer
[26:17] amen she is the Crim of the crop of the
[26:22] Divine
[26:23] Divine
[26:26] institution amen a
[26:30] perfect so if we had that
[26:33] probably denomination mind that let me
[26:37] just be a believer as long as paying my
[26:40] tithe checking my box my good religion
[26:44] saying my little prayer here being in
[26:47] the
[26:48] fellowship that's not
[26:50] it it doesn't work in this
[26:53] generation it doesn't
[26:55] work we've been called up to be
[26:59] the perfect because he
[27:02] said it's a perfect Kingdom so it must
[27:06] be a perfect people to come
[27:17] in because you have to stand and be
[27:22] married to a perfect Son of God listen
[27:27] listen the requ
[27:32] the religion cannot provide
[27:37] that would take something greater than
[27:40] the religion to break us through the
[27:44] sound
[27:49] barrier you must be and you must be a
[27:53] perfect
[27:57] bride
[27:59] not only a
[28:01] bride right
[28:04] no God is looking for a Perfect Bride
[28:08] because you know they also
[28:13] Brides so how can you do it through
[28:18] anything else but the perfect word of
[28:25] God he has provided it yeah yes amen
[28:29] amen now he's Desiring to have a
[28:35] people that will connect it to that
[28:38] perfect word amen that will fear Him
[28:42] amen he can marry them
[28:50] yeah how can you do it through anything
[28:53] else but the perfect word of God which
[28:56] is the water
[28:58] of Separation
[29:01] yes that washes us from our sin amen
[29:05] that's right blood the blood of Jesus
[29:07] Christ think of it the
[29:10] dripping bloody word
[29:13] am you've got to get wet with
[29:19] it you've got to get wet with it's
[29:21] bleeding you can never be there
[29:27] dry the blood of Jesus Christ think of
[29:30] it dripping bloody word the blood the
[29:32] word of God bleeding blood to wash the
[29:38] bride amen she stands perfect that's not
[29:44] a future T amen right
[29:48] now she stands
[29:53] perfect virgin and adulterated she never
[29:58] sinned in the first
[30:02] place then we can say that our start was
[30:07] perfect
[30:09] right was
[30:11] perfect not in my sight amen through his
[30:16] eye am yes I can see that we can see
[30:20] that
[30:23] amen she was trapped into it yes we were
[30:28] trapped into
[30:34] that as we coming back to the reading of
[30:38] the scripture here I'm starting to get
[30:41] nervous on the time
[30:44] now so I'm taking the second part of the
[30:48] scripture which says that there's no
[30:51] King saved by the multitude of an host a
[30:55] mighty man is not delivered by much
[30:58] strength a horse 177 a horse is a vain
[31:02] thing for safety neither shall he
[31:06] deliver any by his great
[31:09] strength now David is talking
[31:13] about we know that the king a king is
[31:16] the highest in every hierarchy of
[31:20] men the men who can
[31:23] have as many the host that he would want
[31:25] a great number following him and in
[31:28] every Kingdom the strange thing is when
[31:31] you are in the Kingdom a
[31:35] subject could give his life for his King
[31:39] in any sit any
[31:41] condition in the countries like in
[31:43] America no you're free you cannot give
[31:45] your your life for any for for any
[31:48] president especially the ones we have
[31:50] right
[31:51] now and the one after if we have someone
[31:54] after but in the Kingdom every subject
[31:58] in the
[31:59] Kingdom if they want to spare the King's
[32:03] life they can kill even until to the
[32:06] last subject in the Kingdom that's how
[32:09] the that's the difference between the
[32:10] kingdom and any other any other power or
[32:13] any other Nation governed by
[32:17] president now David is saying that
[32:20] regardless how many host how large is
[32:23] the
[32:24] number of people in in any kingdom yes
[32:28] it can they can never save that King
[32:31] amen right so the number doesn't count
[32:35] yeah amen they can kill even to the last
[32:39] subject will never save a
[32:41] king not only look
[32:45] uh coming from the King coming now to
[32:48] leaving the king coming to Men He said
[32:50] even the Mighty
[32:52] Man his strength his power his virtue
[32:57] can never never deliver him
[33:01] amen so there's no Deliverance out of
[33:04] outside of any strength and they
[33:07] bringing in even an horse which is the
[33:10] the the the the the the strongest
[33:12] animals they representing power said
[33:16] even the power cannot provide you
[33:18] there's no power that can provide you
[33:23] safety your
[33:25] salvation there's no number of people
[33:27] that can provide you that that
[33:30] salvation no power no might of any man
[33:34] no no ability of any man that can
[33:37] provide you that and then David is
[33:39] giving us a
[33:41] secret that secret is the eye of the
[33:45] Lord
[33:48] amen
[33:50] amen is upon them that fear Him upon
[33:55] them that hope in his Mercy
[33:58] so rather than surrounding yourself with
[34:01] Mighty Men surrounding yourself with a
[34:04] large number of people that can fight
[34:07] for you with the with the powers on this
[34:10] Earth and horse or horses no David said
[34:15] that's everything is in vain you only
[34:18] need one thing you need that eye from
[34:21] the Lord to be upon you to to guide you
[34:25] and if you take a Psalm let's read it
[34:27] bit Psalm
[34:30] 25 chapter
[34:39] 25 verse
[34:42] 12 starting there says what man is he
[34:47] that fearth the Lord there's a question
[34:51] there him shall he teach in the way that
[34:54] he shall
[34:56] choose so the the Lord will teach that
[34:59] man that fear fears
[35:01] him his soul shall dwell at ease and his
[35:06] seed shall inherit the
[35:09] earth the secret of the Lord is with
[35:14] them that fear Him there's a secret
[35:17] there in the fearing of the
[35:21] Lord and He will show them his Covenant
[35:25] he has a secret and he has a covenant
[35:29] amen mine eyes are towards the Lord for
[35:33] he shall pluck my feet out of the out of
[35:36] the net so there's a secret
[35:41] there and within that
[35:44] Covenant that's where we can find the
[35:47] Salvation within that Covenant we will
[35:50] find a
[35:51] Deliverance within that Covenant we will
[35:54] find our safety and we will find eternal
[35:58] life it is within that
[36:03] Covenant don't know the time if it's
[36:05] allow I see it's it's going fast so the
[36:09] reason there's a covenant here that has
[36:12] certain things and those certain things
[36:15] that are of
[36:17] value God has kept these for his people
[36:20] let's go to Exodus 19 1-6 keep your
[36:24] Bibles
[36:26] handy
[36:29] to see why God is holding this Covenant
[36:32] he's holding it for a
[36:41] people Exodus
[36:43] 19 1-
[36:47] 6 this is God the reminding Moses the
[36:51] reason for which he took his children
[36:53] out of is out of Egypt he said in the
[36:56] third month first chapter uh first verse
[36:59] uh Exodus 19 in the third month when the
[37:02] children of Israel Israel were gone
[37:05] forth out of the land of Egypt the same
[37:08] day came they Into the Wilderness of Si
[37:11] for they were departed from reiden and
[37:14] were come to the desert of Si and had
[37:18] pitched in the wilderness and there
[37:21] Israel camped before the mount and Moses
[37:24] went up unto God
[37:28] and the Lord called unto him out of the
[37:31] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[37:34] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[37:37] of Israel now let's listen to what his
[37:40] the Lord is wanting Moses to tell to the
[37:42] children of
[37:45] Israel he said ye have seen what I did
[37:48] unto the
[37:50] Egyptians and how I buar You On Eagle's
[37:53] Wings and brought you unto myself now
[37:58] therefore if you will
[38:01] obey my voice indeed he's giving us a
[38:05] little secret there and keep my
[38:10] Covenant then you shall be a peculiar
[38:15] treasure unto
[38:17] [Music]
[38:19] me above all people for all the Earth is
[38:25] mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[38:29] of priests and a holy nation these are
[38:33] the words which thou shall speak unto
[38:36] the children of Israel so we see that
[38:39] God by taking the children of Israel out
[38:42] of Egypt he had a purpose into
[38:46] that as they were going through the
[38:50] desert they were not walking in the hard
[38:53] the the dry place they were coming onto
[38:56] God himself
[38:58] amen that was the desert was God's
[39:02] provided way to come unto himself
[39:06] amen right your
[39:09] hardship or some CH you have right now
[39:14] let me tell you that those are taking
[39:16] you straight back into the bosom of God
[39:21] am right because he was bringing them
[39:27] not to any country he gave the promise
[39:29] to Abraham not to Israel but he was
[39:32] bringing them to
[39:34] himself to be a peculiar
[39:39] treasure not out there unto
[39:43] himself I like when we don't have to
[39:46] turn in there the book of Deuteronomy
[39:48] says that the Lord has a vouch to
[39:53] thee
[39:54] meaning he has chosen you yeah
[39:59] amen he has avouched to thee this day to
[40:03] be his peculiar
[40:05] people I'm talking let don't leave it
[40:10] 3400 years ago just bring it on your lap
[40:15] amen he has a vouched
[40:20] thee to be his peculiar people as he has
[40:25] promised thee and thou should keep all
[40:28] his
[40:29] Commandments and to make thee I'm
[40:33] talking to you don't look to the one on
[40:35] your left right it's just straight back
[40:38] to you he said and to make thee not an
[40:43] average yeah right above all nations
[40:47] which he has made
[40:51] amen and listen now in
[40:56] Praise this is the only class of people
[41:00] that can give him praise because he
[41:03] chose them unto himself for what for his
[41:08] praise and in name the only people group
[41:13] of people that can bear his name amen
[41:16] and in honor amen the only group of
[41:20] people that can honor God this is this
[41:23] group is here and thou mayest be an holy
[41:27] people unto the Lord thy God as he has
[41:31] spoken so we see that we there was
[41:34] a covenant
[41:37] there he wants us to fear
[41:40] him but we need someone
[41:43] to open the Covenant so we can look into
[41:48] yes I didn't see something but we need
[41:52] someone and that's someone it's God
[41:55] himself and the the the eye of the Lord
[41:58] as we will be reading if we will will
[42:00] not finish it this evening before we
[42:02] even finish the eye of the Lord is God
[42:07] himself he becomes your eye praise
[42:12] God there are so many benefits When You
[42:15] fearing the
[42:17] Lord Psalm 37 34:7 said you don't have
[42:21] to turn the angel of the Lord encampeth
[42:24] round about them that fear Him he
[42:27] doesn't send more than one Angel it's
[42:29] himself yeah sometimes we say the Angels
[42:33] no that's God's Own job Amen to encamp
[42:39] about them that fear Him that's his own
[42:42] personal job he doesn't command any
[42:44] angel in heaven he said I'm there this
[42:48] is my personal job to watch over them to
[42:51] keep them and to give them my
[42:56] eye Psalm 8 859 says surely his
[43:01] salvation is nigh them that fear him
[43:05] that glor that Glory May dwell in our
[43:08] land Psalm 14711 the lord taketh
[43:13] pleasure in
[43:16] them just think that the Lord desires to
[43:21] take pleasure in
[43:26] you in
[43:29] you whether you don't you don't sing or
[43:32] you not maybe you don't know how to play
[43:34] instrument like myself but he wants to
[43:37] take pleasure in you
[43:39] amen
[43:41] amen remember the first time now let's
[43:45] look into the fear before we we walk
[43:49] into the Eyes eye of the
[43:51] Lord the first time ever recorded that
[43:56] the angel of the Lord Lord is seeing a
[44:00] fear the fear in a man this is when he
[44:03] spoke to Abraham when he asked Abraham
[44:06] to offer his son for a burnt offering
[44:09] Abraham took uh Isaac went with him to
[44:14] the to mount uh Mariah to offer him when
[44:19] he was about to offer to plunge the
[44:22] knife into
[44:24] Isaac the Lord the angel of the Lord
[44:27] spoke
[44:29] yes he said that's the Genesis 22:12 you
[44:33] don't have to turn unless you fast and
[44:35] he said let me start at
[44:39] 11 or 10 and Abraham stretched forth his
[44:42] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[44:46] and the angel of the Lord cth unto him
[44:49] out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[44:52] and he said here am I and he said lay
[44:57] not thine hand upon the lad neither do
[45:02] thou anything unto him
[45:05] for now I
[45:08] know that thou fearth God
[45:14] Amen seeing thou has not withheld thy
[45:19] son thine only son for me and Abraham
[45:22] lifted up his eye his eyes and looked
[45:25] and behold behind him a ram caught in in
[45:28] a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went
[45:32] and took the the RAM and offered him up
[45:36] a burnt offering instead of his
[45:40] son that there where the first time the
[45:44] third pool was
[45:47] manifested the first time it was
[45:49] manifested back
[45:52] then they asking him Abraham are you
[45:56] coming his the his servant said are you
[45:58] coming back said I'm coming back with
[46:00] the
[46:01] lad Isaac dad but here's the the the the
[46:06] the wood and where's the the fire the
[46:09] wood where's the the ram the the
[46:11] sacrifice Abraham is
[46:14] speaking something that God is going to
[46:17] bring into an existence amen
[46:21] amen he's saying this is
[46:24] Genesis 22 don't have to turn in I can
[46:27] read it 1 and two and it came to pass
[46:30] after these things that God did tempt
[46:33] Abraham the prophet of God said that God
[46:35] does not tempt he tested Abraham with
[46:39] he's is bringing correction to that
[46:42] translation amen that God did test
[46:45] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[46:49] said behold here I am and he said take
[46:53] now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou
[46:56] Lov
[46:58] and get theee into the land of Mariah
[47:01] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[47:04] upon one of the mountains which I will
[47:06] tell thee of at the verse 8 of the same
[47:10] chapter and Abraham said my son God will
[47:15] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[47:19] offering so they went both of them
[47:22] together this is the answer that the
[47:24] father is giving to his son who was
[47:27] about to
[47:28] die said God himself will
[47:33] provide and in Genesis
[47:36] 2213 God is honoring a word of a man who
[47:42] feared
[47:44] him the third poor coming into an
[47:49] existence not even counting on his word
[47:52] that Abraham go offer your son God said
[47:56] not I I will let my my word not even
[47:59] fulfilled but the for the man that has
[48:02] feared me his word will come into an
[48:05] existence
[48:07] amen now fear is not being afraid right
[48:11] amen no no God never forced anyone to do
[48:16] anything he's a gentleman amen fear is
[48:20] not being afraid
[48:22] right because he take simply take thy
[48:25] son Abraham has full right to say I'm
[48:28] not doing it this time God would not
[48:31] have forced him amen that's
[48:35] right but the the angel of the Lord will
[48:37] be giving us the interpretation of the
[48:40] fear of the Lord
[48:42] himself still in the Book of
[48:45] Genesis Genesis 221 15-18 tells us and
[48:49] the angel of the Lord called unto
[48:52] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[48:55] after Abraham had showed to the angel of
[48:58] the Lord how he feared him how he feared
[49:03] God God is calling him for the second
[49:07] time out of heaven and said by myself
[49:12] have I sworn saith the Lord for
[49:16] because thou has done this
[49:20] thing and hath not withheld thy son
[49:26] thine only
[49:27] son that in blessing I Will Bless
[49:31] thee and in multiplying I will multiply
[49:35] thy seed as the stars of heaven and as
[49:39] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[49:42] thy seed shall possess the Gat the Gate
[49:44] of his
[49:46] enemies 18 is giving us the
[49:49] clue and in thy seed shall all the
[49:53] nations of the earth be blessed be
[49:57] because thou has feared
[50:00] me he's giving us the translation of the
[50:03] fear because thou has obeyed my
[50:12] voice that is the fear of the
[50:15] Lord it's simply obeying God's
[50:22] voice he's not pushing on
[50:25] you it's something that comes out of you
[50:30] and once you obey God's
[50:35] voice his eye will be upon
[50:39] you we will see how that eye comes upon
[50:42] you the prophet of God says in the
[50:44] Jehovah Gyra message Jehovah Gyra
[50:46] preaching
[50:48] 1961 he said so we find out then just as
[50:51] he started to stab his own little son to
[50:54] death speaking about Abraham
[50:57] speaking of of of Abraham the Holy
[51:00] Spirit must have cut his hand said
[51:03] Abraham Abraham stay your hand I know
[51:07] now that you fear
[51:09] God I know that you love
[51:13] me obeying his voice is loving him
[51:21] amen ecclesiast uh
[51:24] 1213 let us hear the conclusion of the
[51:27] whole
[51:28] matter fear God and keep his
[51:32] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[51:37] of man oh my goodness this is the
[51:40] conclusion of the whole
[51:41] matter amen this summarizing everything
[51:45] that we will ever do on Earth just see
[51:48] how the Holy Spirit has been dealing
[51:50] with us here the message has been given
[51:53] to men it's more than 50 years
[51:55] ago but look how the pride of life how
[51:58] things God is unfolding he just to now
[52:01] you have the message now I'm dealing
[52:03] with the inside of
[52:06] you how would you did brother Ben had
[52:09] eyes to see he had full eyes he still
[52:12] had
[52:13] them but why didn't he see that yes
[52:18] meaning that someone is giving him a set
[52:21] of eyes now amen and importing the same
[52:24] set of eyes to all of us praise God
[52:27] amen cuz that eye will tell you
[52:31] differently from your own
[52:33] eyes it goes deeper inside of us and
[52:38] that's the proof that he's Among Us and
[52:41] he wants to dig deeper inside of us God
[52:45] do it
[52:49] am the prophet of God says this in the
[52:51] message respects preached in
[52:55] 1961 he said Solomon said also in the
[52:59] Proverbs that the fear of the of God is
[53:02] the beginning of
[53:04] wisdom now that don't mean that you are
[53:07] afraid of
[53:09] him but that means that you are giving
[53:14] respects and
[53:18] reverence and when you respect God you
[53:22] fear
[53:24] God you fear fear
[53:27] that this is it you fear that you might
[53:33] displease
[53:37] him in some
[53:39] way you fear less you would do something
[53:46] wrong it's no longer fighting trying to
[53:49] to become I when he's looking at me let
[53:52] me let me stay this way
[53:55] no I I don't want to do something that's
[53:58] wrong to
[53:59] him it's it's your at your
[54:03] disposal
[54:06] amen no if if if the message is
[54:09] something that someone is beating you
[54:16] with I was listening to the message last
[54:19] Sunday here taking almost same words we
[54:23] were sharing in uh in Fresno on Saturday
[54:27] I said you can have this message and
[54:30] kill the people with
[54:34] it rather than taking it to heal
[54:38] Amen to encourage to bind yeah to bring
[54:44] together amen and we've done that
[54:46] without maybe knowing it little harsh
[54:49] but now right now we're growing we're
[54:52] maturing how to use the power that has
[54:55] been given into to us in our hands this
[54:58] is God himself given to us his full
[55:02] being in our in our disposal what are we
[55:06] going to do with it
[55:13] amen he molding us how we can use
[55:18] it he said I fear my
[55:21] mother the prophet of God say I fear my
[55:24] wife I fear my my
[55:27] church I fear all God's
[55:30] servants
[55:33] unless I should put a stumbling block
[55:37] somewhere in their
[55:39] way is that a warness yeah right and
[55:44] that love because it's a love that is
[55:47] incentive to that
[55:49] fear right amen it's a motivated it's
[55:54] not motivated by anything else it's love
[55:56] the love towards God towards another and
[56:00] that love brings a fear not what men
[56:04] calls a fear to be afraid no it puts you
[56:07] you into the fellowship with that
[56:13] person I fear the people I fear the
[56:16] people of the city unless I should do
[56:18] something wrong that would cause them to
[56:21] think that I wasn't a
[56:24] Christian that's the fear of the Lord
[56:29] and Samuel even said behold to obey is
[56:32] better than
[56:34] sacrifice and to
[56:36] hearken the fat of
[56:39] rams so the eye of the Lord does more
[56:43] than just
[56:45] beholding or looking from heaven or
[56:48] looking at what we are doing or
[56:51] contemplating no he does more than than
[56:55] that let's take uh Psalm
[57:01] 32 here's
[57:03] David David is regretting for his sin
[57:08] he's crying out he's
[57:10] confessing and during his confession as
[57:14] he's singing we know that these are
[57:16] songs he's been singing and worshiping
[57:19] crying
[57:20] out we will hear that there's someone
[57:23] now talking no more David still using d
[57:26] David's mouth but it's God speaking
[57:28] through
[57:30] David
[57:32] 325
[57:34] starts I acknowledge my sin unto thee
[57:38] and mine iniquity have I not
[57:41] hid I said I will confess my
[57:44] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[57:47] forgive forgest the iniquity of my
[57:51] sin for this shall everyone that is
[57:54] Godly pray unto thee
[57:56] in a time when thou mayest be
[57:59] found surely in the floods of Great
[58:02] Waters they shall not come nigh unto him
[58:06] Thou Are art my Hiding Place Thou shalt
[58:11] preserve me from trouble Thou shalt
[58:14] Compass me about with song of
[58:16] Deliverance Sila in the next verse 8
[58:20] still David but it's now God giving a
[58:24] straight message to David's you still
[58:26] using David's
[58:28] mouth he said I will in instruct thee
[58:33] and teach thee in the way which thou
[58:37] shal go I will guide thee with my
[58:45] eye that's the guiding that we
[58:48] need if God can guide you but this eye
[58:51] is not only to look for to look at you
[58:54] to behold you to contemplate you it's
[58:57] there even to guide
[58:59] you the prophet of God said in the
[59:02] message I don't have it here he said the
[59:03] pillar of fire was God's eye in that
[59:06] time
[59:08] Amen to guide the children of Israel
[59:12] back to their Homeland but that eyes is
[59:15] still here in the message Revelation
[59:18] chapter 4 part two the prophet of God
[59:23] said preached in
[59:24] 1961 he said now what is a
[59:30] man he's going to be we're going to be
[59:33] entering into the eye that is guiding
[59:38] that is supposed to be guiding
[59:40] David the prophet of God is saying now
[59:43] what is a
[59:44] man he is a Triune
[59:48] being Body Soul and
[59:51] Spirit how many knows that Watch God's
[59:55] approach what is his
[59:57] heart you remember my message God chose
[1:00:01] a man's heart for his control tower now
[1:00:05] we're listening
[1:00:07] now God is choosing man man's heart to
[1:00:11] be his control tower the control tow is
[1:00:14] to be able to
[1:00:16] see
[1:00:19] further the devil chose his head for his
[1:00:24] control tower yeah God is chosen the
[1:00:28] heart of man for his control tower and
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:33] devil is chosing the head of man for his
[1:00:37] control
[1:00:38] tower see the devil he makes him see
[1:00:44] things the Devil Makes he choose chose
[1:00:48] the head he makes men see things
[1:00:54] right to look through his eyes the devil
[1:00:59] looking through eyes of a
[1:01:01] man but God chose his
[1:01:05] heart where he makes
[1:01:08] him believe things that he cannot
[1:01:13] see amen this one has a head yeah with
[1:01:18] both eyes and Satan can make him see
[1:01:21] things right and God is choosing
[1:01:24] one in the heart a control tower amen
[1:01:29] not here a control tower down yeah right
[1:01:33] and then he makes him believe things
[1:01:38] that these could not
[1:01:41] see meaning God Imports this one another
[1:01:46] set of eye to
[1:01:49] see remember when Satan attacked Adam's
[1:01:55] bride in the beginning
[1:01:58] he
[1:01:59] started the attack was on her
[1:02:04] eyes in Genesis we don't have to turn in
[1:02:06] Genesis 3 5 said for God doth know that
[1:02:10] in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes
[1:02:16] shall be
[1:02:18] opened and you shall be as God Gods
[1:02:21] knowing good and evil now these eyes
[1:02:24] were not closed
[1:02:26] yeah Adam's eyes were open his bride's
[1:02:30] eyes were open amen but Adam is coming
[1:02:33] his head for
[1:02:36] something meaning that he wanted to have
[1:02:39] access to Adam's bride's eyes so he can
[1:02:43] start showing her
[1:02:48] things and when the woman
[1:02:52] saw still had two set of eyes they were
[1:02:55] always open but she never saw that way
[1:02:59] right amen someone made her see things
[1:03:03] yeah
[1:03:05] amen when she the woman saw that the
[1:03:08] tree was good for food and that it was
[1:03:11] pleasant to the eyes yesterday she did
[1:03:15] not see that she had it
[1:03:17] for how long no one
[1:03:21] knows he wasn't
[1:03:23] pleasant still with the same
[1:03:26] eyes but right now because something
[1:03:30] happened there's a conversation there is
[1:03:34] an
[1:03:34] encounter she's seeing now things are
[1:03:37] different she's seeing what Satan wanted
[1:03:42] to see through
[1:03:47] her so Satan took over her head and made
[1:03:51] her see things
[1:03:53] right she say it's says it was pleasant
[1:03:57] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:03:59] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:04:02] thereof and did eat and gave also to her
[1:04:06] husband with her and he did eat and the
[1:04:10] eyes of them both were opened but they
[1:04:13] were not they were not
[1:04:15] closed because those eyes they were no
[1:04:19] longer using them they were some power
[1:04:23] the devil because the devil got a a hold
[1:04:26] of their heads now he's making them see
[1:04:31] things right right see it beautiful that
[1:04:35] God still know how to get his children
[1:04:38] he still left them a sense of
[1:04:41] hearing because they heard the voice
[1:04:44] yeah right of the Lord Walking In The
[1:04:47] Garden in the C of the evening
[1:04:50] yeah proverb 27:20 says hell and
[1:04:54] destruction are Never
[1:04:58] full so the eyes of men are never
[1:05:03] satisfied listen to this cunning enemy
[1:05:06] of God once he gets a hold of this
[1:05:10] head and then start looking through your
[1:05:13] eyes you will never be
[1:05:17] satisfied how much you can have right
[1:05:19] you will never be
[1:05:23] satisfied but glad in re
[1:05:31] 3:18 hearing a voice counseling us to
[1:05:36] buy I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:05:39] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:05:42] rich in with and white Ren that thou
[1:05:47] mayest be clothed in that the shame of
[1:05:51] thy nakedness do not appear in anoint
[1:05:55] thine isav thine eyes with
[1:05:59] isav that thou mayest
[1:06:02] see the prophet of God says that God's
[1:06:06] eye this is in the God's eye message
[1:06:09] preached in
[1:06:15] 1958 okay good God's eye has been with
[1:06:20] the prophets Through the Ages yes
[1:06:23] amen not these yeah because God got a
[1:06:28] hold of the heart they were seeing
[1:06:31] things that these two could not
[1:06:34] see so God's eye has been with the
[1:06:38] prophet through the age
[1:06:41] ages that could see ahead of time what
[1:06:44] was going to happen meaning when you see
[1:06:46] a prophet arriving on the scene know
[1:06:50] that God's eye is on on the earth amen
[1:06:53] amen yes he said before there was a one
[1:06:59] drop of water that fell from the
[1:07:04] heavens Noah seen the rain
[1:07:08] coming he did not use this
[1:07:13] amen something was inside his
[1:07:17] heart that was able to
[1:07:21] go 20 years see things that were
[1:07:25] happening
[1:07:29] and and once you see that with The Eye
[1:07:32] Inside you can see nothing else but
[1:07:36] that somewhere the prophet of God said
[1:07:39] that once you see this
[1:07:42] message you will see nothing else but
[1:07:46] this
[1:07:49] message once you see Christ you see
[1:07:54] nothing else but Christ
[1:07:57] amen because you're not using this that
[1:08:01] eye is amen down there
[1:08:05] right it sees where nobody else is able
[1:08:08] to
[1:08:10] see he said there was never been any
[1:08:13] rains from
[1:08:15] Heavens the skies were always clear
[1:08:19] there were no clouds never had been a
[1:08:22] cloud upon the Earth why because it was
[1:08:26] God's program to water vegetation
[1:08:29] through the springs and things but Noah
[1:08:33] because God
[1:08:36] said that eye is connected to God's
[1:08:41] voice amen that eye is connected to
[1:08:45] God's saying amen and when it's
[1:08:49] connected there's a fear there love
[1:08:52] there because he will never allow
[1:08:54] anything in
[1:08:57] but Noah because of because that God
[1:09:00] said it's going to rain he saw the rain
[1:09:04] coming 12
[1:09:06] 120 years before one drop
[1:09:10] fell it's a long range Vision yeah amen
[1:09:17] amen and he made preparations to get
[1:09:21] away to get away from
[1:09:23] it and ever since he heard that word
[1:09:27] there was something beating in his bosom
[1:09:31] like a
[1:09:32] puls it's it's going to rain it's going
[1:09:36] to rain it's going to rain so just think
[1:09:40] for 12 years this is what was beating in
[1:09:44] in in Noah's
[1:09:47] heart even when they were inside of the
[1:09:50] the ark was already built sitting there
[1:09:54] went 7 days no drain even his family
[1:09:58] testing time came I can see no as wife
[1:10:01] said
[1:10:04] husband could you review that that
[1:10:06] message you preached the other
[1:10:08] day even the
[1:10:10] sons yeah amen
[1:10:14] yes but the prophet of God said is they
[1:10:17] were sitting there the seventh day they
[1:10:20] felt something got loose in the
[1:10:22] bottom she was floating yeah Noah was
[1:10:27] resting that eye the eye of the Lord is
[1:10:31] the only thing that can give you rest
[1:10:34] amen it shows you exactly who you are
[1:10:39] where you are and then you are resting
[1:10:45] Amen in the message looking at the
[1:10:48] Unseen the prophet of God says Noah
[1:10:51] waited believed moved with
[1:10:56] fear the same fo we spoke about with the
[1:10:59] love of God obeying his voice right and
[1:11:03] built an
[1:11:05] ark all people were criticizing the the
[1:11:08] old fellow must have been crazy but yet
[1:11:12] no Cloud had ever come before there was
[1:11:15] a cloud before there was a drop of water
[1:11:17] in the sky Noah with the Unseen of the
[1:11:21] natural
[1:11:24] eye with his spiritual eye tuned to the
[1:11:29] word of
[1:11:32] God he saw the rain
[1:11:36] falling excuse
[1:11:46] me and he said in the same message he
[1:11:49] said now there had never been any rain
[1:11:52] before and so science would
[1:11:55] would have said to him where's the rain
[1:11:58] coming from and so forth but Noah had
[1:12:02] caught the voice of God that
[1:12:06] eye is catching the voice of God in your
[1:12:10] day and obeying it amen Noah caught the
[1:12:15] voice of God and seen God's program
[1:12:18] there was great things that so many Miss
[1:12:20] saying is God's
[1:12:24] program and you know the prophet of God
[1:12:26] says also that when
[1:12:30] Enoch saw Noah building the ark Enoch
[1:12:35] started getting
[1:12:38] ready there was an eye inside of his
[1:12:40] heart
[1:12:41] said the catching up is Drawing
[1:12:45] Near I like how the prophet of God
[1:12:48] dramatized said going to tell his wife
[1:12:50] honey I'm going to be I used to go this
[1:12:53] direction walking around this time I'm
[1:12:55] going to go on the other side giving her
[1:12:58] a kiss and kissing his children
[1:13:00] grandchildren and then he was caught
[1:13:05] up in the message from that
[1:13:09] time few more
[1:13:12] minutes from that time the prophet of
[1:13:14] God says sometimes when you meet God he
[1:13:19] makes you believe things that the
[1:13:22] natural mind can't conceive
[1:13:26] amen right there is something about him
[1:13:29] when you meet him it changes you and
[1:13:33] makes you a different
[1:13:38] person you look through different eyes
[1:13:43] from that time
[1:13:47] on for the time
[1:13:54] sake he said in the message God's eye
[1:13:59] the great eye of Jehovah Jesus was
[1:14:02] looking through his eyes looking through
[1:14:06] Jehovah's eye the same eye that God is
[1:14:09] going to be giving you to look through
[1:14:12] as he gave to his son the Lord Jesus to
[1:14:16] look through he's going to give to his
[1:14:19] bride to look through the same
[1:14:21] eye he said it must have been Jehovah's
[1:14:25] eye that he was looking
[1:14:27] through when Simon came up and he told
[1:14:31] him that his name was Simon and he was
[1:14:34] going to change it to cus and told him
[1:14:37] his father's name was Jonah he just had
[1:14:41] to be God's eyes that he was looking
[1:14:46] through it could have been nothing else
[1:14:49] but God's eye when he told Nathaniel
[1:14:53] that you are a man with no gu
[1:14:57] there couldn't be nothing else but
[1:14:59] through God's eyes when he saw that
[1:15:02] woman at the world who had many husbands
[1:15:05] he looked through God's eye am he said
[1:15:08] he couldn't do it couldn't be nothing
[1:15:10] else but God's eyes he was looking
[1:15:13] through when he saw that woman who
[1:15:15] touched him the board of His Garment
[1:15:18] Peter saying but you have the multitudes
[1:15:20] everybody's touching you but he looked
[1:15:23] through a different eye yeah his natural
[1:15:26] eyes never even caught that but he was
[1:15:29] looking through a different set of eye
[1:15:31] because he was in contact he had the
[1:15:34] voice he was the voice and he was
[1:15:37] fearing
[1:15:45] God as Jesus said in John 4 14:19 he
[1:15:49] said yet a little while and the world
[1:15:52] sees me no
[1:15:53] more but ye see me because I live you
[1:15:57] shall also live so God's eye
[1:16:02] reflects his will that's the prophet
[1:16:04] saying
[1:16:05] it he said God's eye reflects his
[1:16:11] Spirit he said God's eye reflects his
[1:16:18] word
[1:16:19] spirit will and his word
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:25] in the message the resurrection he said
[1:16:27] the Holy Ghost had him speaking about
[1:16:29] about Steven he said he had him wrapped
[1:16:32] up till he wasn't his own he only looked
[1:16:36] through God's eye he only seen what God
[1:16:42] sin and
