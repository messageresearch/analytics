this is not the nature we know she's not got the right nature anybody in the world knows jezebel's not the right nature but she she's displaying the nature of the false church amen amen and god has other women like esther displaying the nature of the true church and bride of jesus christ and when we look at these things it's more than just stories because we want to look at that and say if i ever start to need to manipulate a situation i'm already moving the wrong way if i have to become dishonest amen to push an agenda forward if i have to become politically motivated in the church amen instantly when i begin to do those things i'm now i'm now replicating the false vine and the false woman amen because all i need to do is humble myself under the word and approach my god with humility and sincerity and reverence to him and tell him my need and let him decide what needs to be done not go and tell him you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do that esther never come and said do this do this do that she said i'm just asking for my life it was up the king and we know later as she progressed amen through there the king would say now what do you want esther never said i want this i want this i want this she never says doing and shush on the palace today as we did yesterday and hang the ten sons of haman she didn't do that of her own accord amen when the king looked at her and gave the report and says now what more would you want and she answered esther is always under headship esther is always submissive to the king the king she will not just demand but the king will ask and then she'll tell but jezebel's not under any headships she's taking headshift she's taking dominion she's become dominating esther's never becoming dominating but esther is not weak you can see esther is not passive amen because when he says what do you want done do today like we did yesterday and hang the tens on she's not weak she's not passive amen she knows what needs to be done amen and she knows amen where the evil is and how to correct it but she's not making demands and she's not making it happen see you can say these are stories in the bible but it comes down to our personal lives amen when we're trying to get something done in a workplace in a church environment and a family and we have to become manipulative and deceiving and political amen you're emulating the wrong character that's the nature of lucifer that has come down through canaan amen that has come down to jezebel but when we can go to god with reverence and humility and sincerity and say lord i know you're god and you construct all things and you ordain all things and i'm happy but lord there's a need that i have here there's a conflict there's a something going on i'm asking you lord just to help me i'm asking you to take care of it and then let god work it out amen let god do the thing
