[0:00] and if I am Cast Away at that day I
[0:03] cannot see where I would be but if I
[0:06] knew that I was wrong and God had chose
[0:09] me to be wrong I would not I would want
[0:12] to stay wrong and because that I want to
[0:16] do his will it's it's I love him till I
[0:21] want his will to be done now that's a
[0:24] big statement but I hope you get it in
[0:26] the way and in the spirit in which it
[0:28] said see I want to do his will I ask him
[0:32] sometimes for things and he shakes his
[0:33] head no I just Rejoice just as much
[0:36] about that as when he says yes because
[0:38] we always ought to ask thy will be done
[0:42] his nose are just as good that's his
[0:45] will that's right it's a whole lot
[0:47] better than this yes is if it's not
[0:50] that's when you really love him whoa
[0:54] when his nose are as good as his yes
[0:56] it's because you know you're in his will
[0:58] even if he desires me to be a vessel of
[1:01] Destruction I won't change my position I
[1:03] want his will
[1:04] this to me is a different kind of a love
[1:07] that's a different kind of a love this
[1:10] is a love that is not serving God for
[1:12] any reward or any satisfaction it is a
[1:15] love that truly just wants whatever he
[1:17] wants this is a love that I believe we
[1:20] are coming to I honestly believe with
[1:22] all my heart I look where I've come from
[1:25] and I'm still not where I'm not there
[1:27] yet and I'm not I I want to be there see
[1:29] he knows the desire in my heart I want
[1:31] to get to the point where I can say Lord
[1:33] if it's a yes wonderful if it's a no
[1:35] wonderful Lord it does not matter
[1:37] anymore at all whatever you want Lord
[1:40] I'm ready to do it that's where we want
[1:42] to be that's that's I think a bride that
[1:45] finds her identity only in her husband
[1:47] only in her mate his will is my desire
[1:50] that's it and so that's a big statement
[1:53] but you know when brother Branham said
[1:55] about Moses he said it always stumbled
[1:56] me Moses how he could say Lord blot my
[1:59] name out of your book but don't forsake
[2:00] your people for they'll say of you you
[2:02] could bring them out but not take them
[2:03] in he said for your for your sake for
[2:06] your namesake don't do it he said I
[2:07] always wondered how could he say that he
[2:09] said it was Christ in Moses saying that
[2:11] and then you get to looking at brother
[2:13] Brandon and say how can a man say that
[2:14] but then you realize it's Christ in
[2:16] brother Branham saying that and then you
[2:18] wonder I say and this flesh I can't say
[2:20] that but Christ in me can say that I
[2:24] this flesh can't do it but he and me can
[2:26] do it because that's his will and I want
[2:29] his will so God get me there just keep
[2:32] breaking me down keep cutting me to
[2:34] shreds keep cutting away everything
[2:35] that's not like that until it comes into
[2:38] view
