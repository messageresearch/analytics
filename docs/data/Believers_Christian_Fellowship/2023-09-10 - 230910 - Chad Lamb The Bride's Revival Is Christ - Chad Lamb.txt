Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning certainly good to be here with you if you could take your Bibles and turn with me to Malachi chapter 4. you probably know which scripture I'm going to open up with um just want to say God bless you it's been here good good to be this one here this morning amen I was glad to hear the specials and especially the bonus special from Sister Priscilla that was good it was a dangerous service to visit sister president but but the special blessed us all so thank you for being willing amen I just wanted to remind you that brother Emmanuel will begin journeying home now he's begun his journey now and he'll arrive home late tomorrow night so just keep him and brother Randy in prayer as they travel home he's giving me updates along the way he's done well the Lord's blessed them they've had a lot of services a lot of fellowship and I'm looking forward to getting him back and hearing more about him and then we'll try to get him to take a service after he gets rested up so he can share with us what the Lord's done there in the Congo also wanted to say that we had a wonderful service Friday night with young adults I meet with the that age group the young adults ages 20 and up those that aren't married we meet a couple times a year and the rest of the church may not know that but you're not in that age group so you're not included sorry but no I wanted to let you know that we had questions and answers such and had a wonderful time and and I really appreciate the the young people the young adults that God has placed here in their commitment their desire and their willingness to give all for him it blesses me every time I spend time with really any of the Believers but I had a special time Friday night I want to say how much I appreciated them amen let's let's look into this word and I'll just preface this morning by saying that there's there is a lot that is on my heart and I'm going to take my time this morning so this is a fair warning ahead of time I'm not going to let myself get pushed and rush and and we're just going to take our time and let's begin here in Malachi chapter 4 verse 5. it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse while we're together let's turn also to Matthew 17. before we're seated go to Matthew 17. maybe 17 and verse 10. and his disciples asked him saying why then sayus describes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto him Elias truly shall first come and restore all things amen God bless you as you're seated keep your Bibles handy I want to turn to one more scripture let's go to II Peter uh second Peter chapter one second Peter chapter one in verse 12. wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth so the scriptures we read we've been over many times have you been a Believer for some time and followed the message you know these things but yeah even Peter says he will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance and even though you know them and be established in the present truth amen so there's some things that I'd like to go over again amen and every time we do they go deeper they they get richer there's more color to it more understanding and and they help it grow and I certainly enjoy it all the time amen so the the this uh that I've been meditating on for the last little bit amen it's it's just started unfolding and uh really uh pouring in I could say if I could use that term and start pouring in all day yesterday and last night really pouring in it started Thursday but last night and so I was just grabbing quotes and grabbing scriptures and just throwing them on paper as fast as it came into my mind and my heart and and then I had a terrible time trying to sort it out into some clear thought because I had rambled thoughts everywhere amen and so I've been scrambling uh early this morning trying to make sense of it so if I hesitate And Delay it's just because I'm trying to read pages ahead and find out where in the world I am with all these thoughts but it was really just pouring down and it was like a refreshing to go through these quotes and scriptures for me and it really blessed me and so brother Frank if you could bring up the white board I'm going to use that for a little bit uh this morning as well in in going through this I wanted to start with a title but I'm not going to give you the entire title I'm just going to give you part of the title and we'll fill in the rest later amen so this is going to be like School amen and for the rest of the service everybody's going to be guessing what's the last part of it amen and and I'll tell you it these Revelations are very Dynamic they're not simplistic so so you can put all kinds of things into the style and you'll see what I mean just in a moment so yeah it's up I'm going to go ahead and write this down I'm going to start by writing this now you see what I'm saying you could drop all kinds of things in after this phrase and be correct because the word of God is very Dynamic and it's very expressive and it expresses itself in many ways so at the end I'm just going to give you my thought on it my what what my inspiration was but but please don't ever take that as the end all the only proper way to finish this statement that's not true this is very Dynamic statement and encompasses many many things in many facets to the Revelation but this is what I want to deal with this morning as the bride's Revival and what the bride's Revival is and I'm going to I'm going to read a lot of quotes all right and so listen the quote is just as fresh now as the day it was spoke and just because my head's down reading doesn't mean we shouldn't say Amen when the word strikes us amen and so we we want to keep the word fresh and don't get lost as I'm reading and as I'm reading I may not reference every place that I'm I'm reading from because I have so many quotes that I want to read especially I'll get into one segment I'll just be reading little phrases brother Brown says out of several different messages but my notes are always available online if you go to the website they're always available you can get every reference it's right there and you can go through it but I'm not going to take the time because I I think we're going to have the need for all the time that we have so in the third seal brother Benham says now that's what that's what's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so here comes brother Benham in in 1963 and he's preaching in the seals he's in the third seal I think it's important to know where we are in the sequence of the ministry and he's in the he's now laying down the seals he's in the week of the uh and the week of March there where he's preaching the seals in March 1963 and he's saying they have the bride hasn't had a Revival yet so that means brother branham's been on the scene and he's been ministering since 1930 somewhere along there he begins his ministry he begins his healing campaign going out in 1946 commissioned by an Angel to do so and we know that he's he's already displayed the first pull in the second poll but in all of that the healing campaigns the camp meetings the tent meetings and the first and second poll and all of that he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet it's really important to note he said there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it all right so brother remembers looking for it it hasn't happened yet this one that'll stir this bride amen and and it'll stir I I would like to I would like to make this statement not to change what the prophet said but I'm I'm look we're looking at the end time bride because we know every Church age had bride there was bride in every Church age Amen in what stirred amen was stirred in the Lutheran Church age what stirred the bride and revived the bride then it was the true revelation of the word that was restored in that day right same thing in Wesley's day same thing in the Pentecostal Revival it was the true word that was being restored that revived the bride there's been uh there's been bride in every age and every age has been stirred by the portion of the word for that age and it's awakened the bride in that day but I believe what brother man is referring to is the end time bride when it comes to the full manifestation to the culmination all right he says no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again now he ties The Awakening or the Revival he ties it to the mystery that's in the seven unknown Thunders it'll take the seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again and he calls the waking up of the Bride also the Revival of the Bride he ties these terms together so we realize without the revelation of the seven Thunders there is not a bride's Revival or an Awakening of the Bride it's going to take the seven unknown Thunders that's what the prophet said amen I know like I said I know we're rehearsing amen I know we know these things because you're established in this present truth but I will not be negligent to bring this back to your memory and the message recognizing your day and its message Prophet says everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining Minister's crying I was in Reading in one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper and I know the editor and I know the people and they're godly people very fine brother and sister more of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field Herald of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads that you know you see it all the time fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day it's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening Awakening they're good people why is it what what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride this is this message is preached in July of 1964 after more than a year after the opening of the seals when he's there in the third seal in March of 1963 he said there's been no stirring yet there's been no Revival to awaken the bride it'll take those seven unknown Thunders now a little over a year later he's showing the condition of the churches crying for Revival crying for a great stirring crying for an Awakening then he says why are they doing that they're good people amen but what did they do they failed to recognize read again they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride so somewhere between March of 63 and July of 64 what brother Branham said there hasn't been yet to revive the bride awaken abroad now he says it's come somewhere in between there you can decide where it is in between there but it's somewhere in between there you've got about a year and three months to work with praise God see by being Christians they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done so brother we're gonna say it's already passed that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you what brother I'm saying it's already happened right by you it's been all around you know during the seals for the rest says it's happening all around you isn't that what he says during the preaching of the seals he's saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're catching it I mean he says this several times there's several places in the seals I didn't pull them all out but you know they're there amen he's saying I hope he says I hope I don't have to take it right out in my hand and show it to you I hope you're catching what what the spirit's trying to get over without coming right out and saying it you see he makes these statements right and he's saying it then he comes to the end of the seals and he says now you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it praise be the Lord but somebody's supposed to get it and I believe that somebody's me amen I believe in the in the right period of time and the end time in the right position to catch it amen so he said it's already happened right by you it's going on it's happened and you missed it and the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says but but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God so now we understand there's an Awakening that comes a stirring and Awakening that comes by the revelation of the seven Thunders amen and and when the bride by that has a Revival what will she do in this revival she'll come back and begin to line herself up with the word it's a Revival back to the word it's a Revival back to being a proper Church to being a virgin bride amen not like what sometimes revivals are called in the nominational world or what they've been called in previous places in previous times amen but brother man is beginning to show us what the Revival is in the bride the bride's Revival is an Awakening amen it's an Awakening that comes it'll take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up amen then he says it happened because they don't recognize the Awakening of the Bride they don't recognize what's going on all around you amen and that Revival when she begins to have a Revival she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch the bride catch that woman elect amen in modern events May clear by prophecy it says now we want to be posted to know to take place for this age that we live in God has lauded his word to each age so so much to each age and we must notice that one age cannot carry over into another age it just won't work for instance as I've said I believe last night I'm constantly speaking night after night places and sometimes I make a remark the second time I don't mean to repeat myself but I say this uh what good would it have done Moses to try to preach Noah's message or what good would it have done Jesus to try to preach Moses message or what good would have done Martin Luther to continue on with the Catholic message what good would it done Wesley to continue on with the Lutheran message what good would it done Pentecostals to continue on with the Methodist message are what good will it do Pentecost to continue on when the bride's being called amazing brother bear I'm saying one age amen cannot let's see what he says at the beginning here I want to get this right God is allotted his word DHA it's so much to each age we must notice that one age cannot carry over into another age remember brother Branham taught this he taught this uh through the Passover and he showed that in the Passover amen that that that that the lamb that they were given in the Passover every bit of it had to be consumed that night nothing could be carried over and that which was not consumed needed to be burnt by fire because it wasn't to linger to the next day they were to consume it that day then he also showed it in the manna that would fall every night and every morning they could go and gather Manna but they could never keep that Manna over to the next day because if they kept the Mana over to the next day it became stagnant it got it got worms in it it became rotten so then he begins to show amen that the Manna of yesterday that fell which was the word for that age that Manna cannot be carried over into this age amen there must be a Manna for today and you realize that it's the same manner what is manna Heavenly bread so what was Heavenly bread and Luther's day we must receive Heavenly bread so it's not in no way were we rejecting the truth that Luther had by saying we can't know but we can't carry that over we have to get the fresh bread and the fresh bread it contains the truth that Luther had it contains the truth that Wesley had it contains all of that because what was in the previous age is here in this age but we can't carry it over we have to keep receiving it fresh so he begins to tell us this that it cannot carry over into another age and so he says what good Moses preaching Noah's message what good would it be Luther preaching Wesley's or Pentecost preaching or yeah uh Wesley preaching Luther's or Pentecost preaching Wesley's age and what good would it do Pentecost to continue on when the bride's being gone so the Pentecostal Revival that message is not to continue on there's a fresh Manna now and the message works is Faith expressed 1965 said God to the Pentecostal Church of this day the restoration of the gifts May Lord those men maybe some of them present here some of them hearing the tape around the world may they realize that this is the calling out of the Bride not a Pentecostal message the Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back to the church but this is the calling forth of the Bride another message that has to come just before Sodom has to be burned so Brothers clearly telling us one message cannot carry over into another age and he's telling us this is another age he's very clearly trying to tell us the Pentecostal message is not to carry over into this age the Pentecostal message was the restoration of the gifts and it was just as necessary as Wesley's message was and just as necessary as Luther's message was because there was something the church was lacking that the church had in its original form but now was lacking and it was coming back through the messenger it was delivered back the truth of justification delivered back the truth of sanctification and delivered back the truth that the gifts are supposed to be in the church so brother bam says the Pentecostal I mean again the Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back in the church that was the message of Pentecost the restoration of the gifts which they called the baptism of the Holy Ghost but brother Branham even goes to show that it wasn't actually what they thought it was they thought it was the final outpouring the latter rain the baptism holy ghost that would carrying them to the Rapture but they know they found out it wasn't that it was actually the restoration of the gifts the latter rain could not come until you first had a teaching rain and you could not have the teaching Reign without the prophet messenger and the prophet messenger would teach to restore all the truths that were lost through the seven Church ages tying us back to the Bible back to what the apostles preached back to what Paul laid out and then amen and then after that we would carry over into the Thunders we're going to get to that in a minute so praise be to God this Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back to the church but this is different than that just as much as the Westland Revival was different than the Lutheran Revival is that true there are some elements that were the same there's some elements that were very different and the Wesleyan Revival was much different than the Pentecostal Revival but the bride's Revival is different yet than the Pentecostal Revival none was a copy of the previous it was something further it was an advancement it was a moving on it was a going higher Wesley's Revival was higher than Luther's Pentecost Revival was higher than Wesley's and the bride's Revival is higher than the Pentecostal Revival and it's not just a replication of the previous Revival this is something different altogether so I want to read this again this is the calling out of the Bride not a Pentecostal message the Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back to the in the church but this is calling forth of the Bride another message that has to come just before Sodom has to be burned so brother I'm saying this is another message this is another age are we clear 1965 I've heard but now I see and we are not living in Luther's age Wesley age or the Pentecostal age you believe what the prophet says the Pentecostal wage was only a restoration of the gifts coming back in the church but we're living in the evening time we're living in a time of the calling out of the Bride this is this is a different Revival altogether it's it's not a continuation of the Pentecostal Revival neither is a replication of the Pentecostal Revival it's something beyond that amen 1964 the identified Christ of all ages he says now we find out that now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they're still miss it they're trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're plumbed past that we're living on up to the rapturing time for the calling the end time so brother Brown keeps saying this is another time this is another age this is another message amen and modern events May clear by prophecy this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal age is past Pentecost is gone this is Harvest Time oh I just love it amen I love it because that's where I came from amen I was raised up in that hangover the Pentecostal Revival raised the Pentecostal boy generationally had run deep in my family amen from the time of Azusa Street all the way up to my generationally our family was Pentecostal and I remember the stories of my grandpa when he would tell me about the the reality of the Pentecostal Revival where the true bride amen was being called out and they were receiving the gifts and I I would love to hear my grandpa tell the stories because there was a genuineness to it it was still when the Revival was in the it was In the Heat of that Revival but I wasn't born in that time amen I can't go back and replicate my grandfather's days amen because I'm born for a different age I'm born for a different message I'm born for the end time message which is not a Pentecostal message it's plum on beyond the Pentecostal mess so the pentacle so when I hear about my grandpa's stories and and the Miracles and the signs and the things that were done I Marvel in that because that was genuine that was real that was the Revival but I also cannot long to reproduce my grandfather's days because I'm going the wrong direction if I hear his stories and I hear the stories of Azusa Street and how wonderful it was and hear what what what my family talks about amen long ago the miraculous things that happened amen the way the church was clean the way the church was holy I'm telling you the Pentecostal church was clean under the reality of that Revival they were clean they were holy they were godly people I look back on that and I could say oh I wish that it was still like that listen if we're looking back long and it was still like that we're missing something because we're plumbed beyond that now this message is beyond the Pentecostal message we're plumbed past that now we're not looking back saying oh if I could recreate my grandpa's day those were the Glorious Days that's when it was real that's when something was happening amen if we use terms like that we've absolutely missed the reality of where we're standing because where we're standing is an advancement on that it's past that amen it's a higher degree it's a higher calling praise God and there was nothing wrong with it it was beautiful it was perfect it was worthy of Merit it was worthy of honor it was worthy to be disgusting and with Merit and with respect and with admiration because it was a living reality and it was beautiful in its day but we can't live life in a rearview mirror we have to keep moving on with Christ in The Invisible union he says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day brother Venom is not talking about the Azusa Street Revival now he's talking about original Pentecost 2000 years ago listen I did not say this the prophet of God said this this is in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age amen amen this this quote has so much meaning amen because because though our hearts are turned back to the faith of the Father the original Pentecostal father brother Ben is now telling us the word that fell on the day of Pentecost our hearts are turned back to the faith of fathers but there's another word for this day that's beyond the word that they had for that day and the word that found on that day won't work in this day that was for that day amen because you know on the day of Pentecost amen they they what happened on the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost they tear it in Jerusalem until they were undue with power from on high according to the promise of the fathers the promise that Jesus gave them that he would come to them that they would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that they would be endued with power from on high and they would be his Witnesses and and while they waited and tarried when Pentecost was fully come in when the right time came when it was the right season the right time God's appointed time amen then then in came a wind as a a rushing Mighty Wind amen and then they were all filled with the spirit they had cloven tongues of fire them they went out into the street they speak in tongues as the lord gave them utterance and all the people that were gathered from So Many Nations they all heard them in their own language it doesn't mean that they were speaking their language amen the the miracle that happened on the day of Pentecost was not just a spoken tongue but that everyone there could hear with their own language the brother man points that out that that was the that was a marvelous miraculous thing at Pentecost and the people that were Hearing in their own language hadn't even received the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet and then Peter stands up Amen on the day of Pentecost and he begins to preach the inaugural message he begins to lay down the word for that day and he goes back to the Old Testament back to job and he says this isn't what you think but this is the word made manifest before your eyes this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes what Joel said this is it then he goes on and starts to tie Jesus Christ to the testimony the Prophecies of David what David had said to the Old Testament and this Jesus whom you crucified God has made both Lord and Christ what's what's he doing he's standing up and he's preaching the word for their day he's preaching modern events made clear by prophecy is that right and that was the word for his day and under that preaching their hearts were convicted and they say men and Brethren what shall we do and he begins to tell them amen repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and that day three thousand were added to the church good message what was it modern events made clear by prophecy and It produced but brother Brennan says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost see Pentecost was the Fulfillment of the promise the promise Christ made the promise of the fathers there's still other prophecies to be fulfilled and our day is the Fulfillment of those other prophecies I'm just going to read this short quote again because it it so brings clarity to me the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bright age so the Pentecostal Revival was rep and the restoration it gives was representing that day again but we've got something different the Feast of trumpets he says the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us like every one of these little sentences I'm giving you is an absolute mouthful we have preached and can preached whole messages on these statements but he's he's telling us that the seventh Angel's message well who's the seventh angel amen the seventh angel was William Branham the seventh angel the seventh messenger the messenger to the laodicean church age to the seventh eight that was him and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet everything the same seal is to what what's it supposed to do call the people the bride out of Pentecostal and World tradition it's supposed to call us out of the Pentecostal tradition and all the other world tradition not to stay in it to call us out of it and bring us to what amen bring us to what what will it bring us to to the genuine atonement amen what is the atonement the atonement is what covers for you and makes you right in the sight of God the atonement is what breaks brings you to at one meant Amen to bring you back in reconciliation with God it takes an atonement and now he's bringing us out of the Pentecostal and World Traditions to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us if you want the genuine atonement you must get the word for your day message I have heard but now I see into 65. it says and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed so we got that in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared revelation 10. when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service so now he's telling us in the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals will be revealed the mysteries of God would be declared which is revelation 10. so the declaring the mysteries of God is Revelations 10 verse one to seven we're going to read that shortly when the seventh angel begins to sound so the mysteries of God would be revealed under Revelation 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service so now brother Benham is becoming very clear that his message to declare the seventh Angel's message was not back under the healing campaigns and not back under the first and second poll we'll go through them quotes that really clarify this but but his message is attached to the Seven Seals and the mysteries of God in Revelations 10 that's his message amen let's let's do this I've got another question I want to write another good question what is the message now this is the same thing this is also very dynamic you can have many answers for this but I'm going to pull out some quotes and show what brother Branham says I mean he says many things we know the message is Christ that's a quote but remember says that the message is Christ but let's look at it in this context what is the message he says now uh this is out of the anointed ones at the end time 1965. notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message he's really telling us amen that there was much of his ministry that was foundational for his message I hope that doesn't stumble you but his message is declaring the mystery his message is attached to the seals and his message is attached to revelation 10. that's when he begins to declare his message not under the healing but this not when he starts on that's not what he's declaring his message not when he starts in his ministry but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word amen what is that that is his message so we could write it this way what is the message let's just say the opening of the word is that right revealing the Mysteries that's when he begins to declare his message not when he starts on but when he declares his message Revelation 10 7 seals I find the seven Thunders so the reason I write this is because it's important to know because we use this term all the time the message I'm in the message or your message believer I'm a message believer you go to a message church is that a message preacher is that a message Pastor is that right and it's not wrong I'm not please don't feel condemned for saying that I say that all the time there's nothing wrong with that but really we need to know what the message is because the if we if if if we oh my goodness if we don't have a clear understanding we'll incorporate things into the message that aren't part of the message we will include things that really is not the message but the message when the seventh angel begins to declare his message that message will be the third pool which is the opening of the word which is the revealing the Mysteries or the Mysteries revealed that is the message now he says the message is Christ well tell me what's different between Christ and the opening of the word what's different between Christ and the Mysteries revealed so it's all synonymous they mean the same thing amen so what is the message so this to me becomes important because if I don't know what the message is then then I begin I begin looking at everything that was previous to the declaring of the message and making that the message so I can make the first pull the message and I can make the second pull the message but brother Brenham said the third pool was the message this is all a precursor these are all things building up or leading into the message there are also things uh let's just say it this way when we get into the three pools it's to me it's so important that we always understand what we're talking about because we use terms and then terms begin to lose their meaning at with the abundance of use so we say third pull but we have to keep in our mind what is the third pool because brother Branham in 1956 begins to tell us that he had a dream right at the beginning of the year right at the end of 55 beginning at 56 or a vision and in in in this he's fishing by water and he's and he's trying to catch fish amen and there's a bunch of other brothers around which were ministers and they were all fishing too amen and they were all he said all these Brethren they were catching all the little fish he says but I could see out in the water and there was big fish in the deep water and the big fish in the deep water he called them rainbow trout everything has meaning in the big fish in the deep water is a rainbow trout not a Cutthroat not not a bass not a catfish nada Muskie not whatever they were they were a specific kind of fish and rainbow we first see Rainbow and Noah's flood and the rainbow is a sign of a covenant that God made with man so these are a rainbow trout these are Covenant fish these are special fish the one species that ties us to the Covenant is right with the word rainbow in it is rainbow trout and so he said they were rainbow trout and he began to think I think I can catch him now he's a minister like the other ministers they're all fishing and they're all catching little fish amen so so uh uh you think it looks successful because I mean they're throwing out lime they're pulling in fish this is a successful Ministry but Brother Bear was looking at that and thinking no I think I could catch these special fish amen this certain fish not what they're catching I can catch the ones in deep water so if he looks down he's got a fishing pole in his hand there's a lure and all the brothers gather around and say oh brother Venom you can do it and you know show us how to do it and all that and he said all these ministers they gather around and and he and he casts it out there amen and he gives it a little jerk and he says that's the first pull when he pulls the fishing pole and pulls the lure now he gets the term first second third pull from this vision it all comes from this Vision so when you want to understand the polls come back to the vision so now when he comes to the first pool says it it attracts the little fish that was the sign in the hand when he takes somebody by the hand he tells us all of this in the message and he would a pattern would break out of his hand and begin to discern what disease they had and then he says on the second pole and now he started saying now now he starts saying let me show you how to do this now I'm a fisherman I can fish so he starts thinking that he knows what to do and how to catch these rainbow trout now remember the target fish is the rainbow trout not the little fish across the bank that any of the other brothers can catch so now in the in in the second pool he goes to pull the lure later he tells us what he should have done and the way the second pull should have worked he says in the second poll he should have gave it another tug and when he gave it the tug it would scare all the little fish away that were attracted by the first pool and when all the little fish darted it would get the attention of those big rainbow trout and their big rainbow trout would come up to the lure and then he said after it got their attention they came near he said the third pool would hook them set the hook in the fish and bring the fish all the way in that's the way this was supposed to work but in the second pool he pulled too hard and when he pulled hard amen The Lure of fish and everything a little tiny fish had bit The Lure and he said it looked like skin over my lure the fish was so small how he swallowed he said I'll never know he pulled it it all come tumbling back on him and now he was there with a pile of fishing line all around him and the angels the Lord said I told you not to do that and he says forgive me Lord I'm a stupid person so he tells us how the three pulls should have worked and he tells us his error and over emphasizing the second pull which was discernment when he would tell people the thoughts that was in their heart right so that means that the first pull or the second pool were not catching rainbow trouts they were getting the rainbow Trout's attention but the pool that was supposed to catch the rainbow trout was the third pole he said the third pool that'll get them that's what's supposed to catch so when we talk about the third pool we're talking about the pool that catches the rainbow trout the elect of God the predestinated seed the Covenant fish and I made this remark in Romania and I think it's amazing I I think it's beyond a possible consequence that God would allow brother Branham in his lifetime to catch the world record rainbow trout do you realize that that this man who had this Vision in 1955 that was commissioned by God to catch the rainbow trout then the division the deep water he actually went fishing on on a river in Idaho I believe it was Idaho somewhere and while he was fishing he actually caught at that time the largest rainbow trout that had ever been caught in the history the known history of the world you think that's a coincidence there's no way that's a coincidence that God is just proving again and again and again and again that it's this Prophet this message he's the one that knows how and God demonstrated to the whole world this man can catch the big rainbow trout they couldn't deny it it went on the record books he had it stuffed he hung it on his wall there's no denial this man knows how to catch rainbow trout God made the whole world testify of it listen this message is so Supernatural but it's so Supernatural and can be yet so humble and subtle at the same time unbelievable unmistakable you got the Fingerprints of God all over it but yet in such a humble way can slip right through the radar and go undetected by masses in their face but unknown on display but unrecognized so now the third pool is the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed so the third pool was the opening listen the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word now what was the third Source pool supposed to do it was supposed to catch the Covenant fish the big rainbow trout in the deep water what is going to catch the elect of God it is going to be the seals the Mysteries revealed if you ever want to know why we preach on the seal so much and why we hit the seventh seal in the third pole and the mysteries of God in Revelations 10 is because we're fishing for rainbow trouts and the prophet taught us how to do it amen praise the Lord and the message what is the attraction on the mountain he's referring to at the time he's up in Sabino Canyon in January I believe it was of 1963 the Lord calls him he's in his bed yet and the Lord calls him to go out to Sabino Canyon and he takes a notebook and he goes and he goes up to a rock that has been called Pulpit Rock it's a rock that looks like a Pulpit it's built on a rock Tower right in the middle of the canyon and he's there on his knees with his hands in the air and something struck his hand when he looked it was a sword and he says the voice came back and said not a king sword but the king's sword the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third pool it's the Vindication of your ministry so now the third pole brother said is the opening of them seals the revealing of the mystery the third pull is the fishing technique that catches the big rainbow trout the third pull was to hook them and bring them in it's only the third pool he said it's the Vindication of your ministry why because his ministry is the seventh angel his ministry is those Mysteries his ministry is those seals his ministry is the Thunders that is the message that he has to declare over on the same page there it's so what then what was the third pull now the king's sword in his hand well what did the king's sword represent this is what the voice tells him the word of the Lord now the word of the Lord is in your hand to be given out this is the third pool it is the Vindication of your ministry praise God so now I hope we know what the third poll is the third pool is the opening of the seals the third pull is the word of the Lord in the hands of the Prophet the third pull is the Mysteries revealed the third pull amen it's all of those things the opening of the word the third pull is Christ the third pull is the Mighty God unveiled praise God now we go down to Christ as the mystery of God revealed he says God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence so this is so important he says God's great mystery how it's a secret so he's talking about a great mystery he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it so what is the great mystery that even the angels don't understand he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord so the coming of the Lord is laced into this mystery under these seals in this Secret Under the seventh mystery amen and brother Brahm ties all this to the third pull he ties all this to the declaring of the message all of these things tied together let's turn in our Bibles and look at Revelation chapter 8. I want to read this together so that we can see so in this quote brother Branham says that's the reason there was silence in heaven for space of half an hour come all right let's read Revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so the silence in heaven is related to the opening of the seventh seal right so that's the first part of this sentence but the sentence is over let's go to Revelation 10 verse 1. and he says then Brothers says that's the reason of Silence in heaven for the space of half an hour that's Revelation 8 1 the opening of the seventh seal and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord thou he ties two scriptures together and he puts them in the same sentence and makes them the same event and one is Revelations 8 1 the opening of the seventh seal in silence and now he ties it to Revelations 10 1-7 and let's read that together and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he sat with he sat he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice is when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices this is what brother branham's referring to in this quote the seven Thunders uttering their voices and he's attaching it to the seventh seal and now we're going to see why he calls it silence he attaches it to the Silence of the seventh seam and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying it to me seal up those things which is seven Thunders uttered and write them not so this is where brother Benham attaches these two portions of scripture together and he takes the opening of the seventh seal and silence there's not even a symbol like the other seals there's no White Horse no red horse no souls under the altar there's nothing to show it's absolute silence meaning it's an absolute mystery still then he comes to the seven Thunders and the Seven Thunders utter their voices amen and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices John was about to write because the uttering of the seven Thunders said something intelligible it wasn't just no it was a voice of God Amen that gave information that he could write down so John was about to write and he's about to write a voice from Heaven says right not what the seven Thunders uttered so there's an utterance under the seven Thunders that can be written down write them not and seal it up so what do we have in the seven Thunders we have a revelation amen that something was open just like just like in Revelation chapter eight we have the Revelation that the seventh seal was open it's open but what is it silence we don't know it's still a mystery we have seven Thunders seven Thunders uttered their voices absolutely they said something what did they say we don't know silence and brother bam ties these two together and he links it to the coming of the Lord because God kept this secret even Jesus didn't know what was it the coming of the Lord and it's part of the third pool and it's part of the Mad the the the prophet declaring his message and his message for running the second coming he said your message what is his message his message is the Mysteries revealed his message is the third pull is that message is the opening of the word and your message will forerun his second coming and here he ties it all together with the scriptures praise be to God so beautiful this is the this is the message friends let's go on verse 5 and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lift up his hand to Heaven swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel who's the seventh angel we can give it a name William Branham he came as the seventh angel but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound when he shot brother bam said not in the healing not when he started out but when he began to declare his message but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets brother Branham takes Revelation 10 1-7 and he makes that he may he attaches that to the seventh seal he calls that seventh seal the end time seal and and brother Branham calls himself the the messenger of the seven seal and the messenger of the seventh seal his message is Revelations 10 1-7 praise God so now you can you can begin to see and and why are we going through all this brother Chad amen because I just feel like it amen praise the Lord it makes me feel good but also I want us to absolutely understand where we are amen and not not go backwards in Revelation to a previous thing I don't want to go back Amen to the first and second pull amen you know what the the supernatural things and effects that were there and the restoration of gifts it's in the church and it can still attract the tension of the little fish how many times can you testify of God healing your body how many times supernatural has God delivered you or answered a prayer how many times has God discerned your very thoughts amen through a brother through a conversation through a tape through a sermon how many times has God worked Supernatural in your life and you can share those Supernatural things and what can it do it can attract attention amen and it can get the little fish to come then it can get the little fish to scatter is that right the same process can work in our life but what is going to catch the Covenant fish it's going to be the opening of the word it's going to be the Mysteries revealed it's going to be the third pool it's going to be this Revelation Amen in the seals is actually what's going to catch the rainbow trout amen we still have things in our life that vindicate improve and we still have manifestation and we still have ways to declare God absolutely amen but they will not catch the Covenant fish they may get attention from the fish amen when it scatters the little fish but it will catch them is the same thing that will catch them and brother branham's vision is the same thing they'll catch them now it's the opening of the word so I have another question all right and now this is always my disclaimer if I misspell on this just love me anyways and if I misspell really badly please don't laugh out loud it'll get in my head and I won't be able to finish the sermon okay well you're not a good speller and it's silent and everybody's watching you possibly you can't imagine what pressure this is and then I gotta grammarize that's commas I don't even know if they're there right okay I'm gonna face the sentence all right we're almost done all right there's our question how does the Elijah of Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children to the fathers it's a good question because we want to know we use we use these terms we use these scriptures we talk about this law we know who the Elijah Malachi 4 is it was William Branham we know who the seventh Angels it's William Branham I mean these are not Mysteries we know they are amen and and so when we use the term the message what are we talking about we're talking about his message the opening of the word the revealing of the Mysteries Revelation 10 1-7 that's really what we're talking about we say the message now when we say the Elijah of Malachi 4 we know that that is William Branham when we go to Revelation 10 1 7 when it says the voice of seventh angel that's William Branham so that's why brother Branham can take Revelation 10 1-7 or other let's say Revelation 10 7 and Malachi 4 5 and 6 and he can put them right together because they're the same person right amen praise God so we're there but he's commissioned to do something and that something is first to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and that was accomplished in John the Baptist ministry is that right he took the he took the fathers of of the Old Testament faith and turned them to the New and Living Way to the way of the children of the way of the Apostles amen and so he turned them and and prepared the way for the Lord but now there's another Elijah coming that we read in the beginning in Matthew when he says Elias shall first come and restore all things John the Baptist did not restore all things he prepared the way preparing the way and restoration are two different works so the first part of this prophecy is fulfilled by John the Baptist but the second part of this prophecy turned the heart to the children to the father amen could not have been done by John the Baptist Jesus prophesied yes Elijah shall come a first and restore all things that's the Elijah that we're talking about amen that we know is William Branham but he was to come and do something and that was to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so the revelation of Malachi 4 uh I want to be careful how I word this you cannot make it simplistic and say the revelation of Malachi 4 is God sending a prophet that is not actually the full revelation of Malachi 4. if we think Malachi 4 is God sending a prophet then we only understand a fraction of Malachi 4. and I would say a tiny fraction of Malachi 4 a very small part of Malachi 4. so when we treat Malachi 4 that prophecy as only the prophecy of a coming Prophet we have really limited our Revelation and our ability to understand what this is all about and so many times I see we we as I'm talking about brothers and sisters in the message we treat the prophecy of Malachi 4 as only as if it has to do with brother Branham and as if it only has to do with God sending Elijah but that to me that's that's the the smaller part of that scripture because once Elijah comes he's commissioned to do something to me that's the point of the prophecy so the point of the prophecy is not just it'll come that's part of it but what's he supposed to do once he comes that becomes the bulk or the purpose or the intent of the prophecy and what he's supposed to do is turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen so what's the intent of Malachi 4 what's the point of Malachi 4 what's to be accomplished in Malachi 4 is that this Elijah this Prophet is to come he's commissioned with a task and that is to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers this is Malachi 4. the heart of Malachi 4 especially for our day I hope that you see what I'm saying now not diminishing there's nothing that we ever say in any way to want to diminish the message of the of the Prophet the message of the Prophet is the message is the word is Christ is everything we want to emphasize we're not trying to downplay him we're trying to find out what he came to do amen and really catch the purpose of Malachi 4. so so many times we rattle off Malachi 4 Revelation 17 30. and these are just throw out scriptures Revelation 10 7 and in many ways where we're referring back to William Branham Malachi 4 that's him Revelation 10 7. that's him amen uh uh uh Luke 17 30. that's him but the greater part of every one of those scriptures is what's supposed to happen when he's here he has to come to fulfill the commission he has to come to do the work of a prophet amen but the work of the Prophet is the heart of these scriptures so what will happen in Malachi 4 when that Prophet comes he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers well what will happen in Luke 17 30 in Luke 17 30 there'll be a revealing of the son of man the revealing of the son of man is attached to the coming of the son of man it signifies a personal coming two we get excited that Luke 17 30 amen we could see that scripture refill we could see that scripture fulfilled and manifest in that man that's exciting but there's something more behind that scripture what's he revealing he's revealing the son of man this is attached to the brother bam takes this amen and he takes the scripture in Matthew that says in the coming of the son of man show shall be in the days of Noah and he attaches them together the revealing of the son of man is also the coming of the son of man to me that's profound I can know in what vessel the son of man was revealed but if I stop there I've missed the point I can know who the Elijah of our day is but if I stop there I missed the point of Elijah company and I can tell you who the seventh angel is in Revelation 10 7. amen that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I can tell you who that is that's William Brandon but if I stop there I missed the point of that voice because under that voice the mystery of God is to be finished to me all of these things that we're talking about become the profound part of these scriptures amen because if he had come and not done this then it would not be the Fulfillment of the scripture if he had come listen if brother Branham had come and he had discern the thoughts and intents of the heart amen if he had shown the sign amen of discernment if he had prayed for the sick had healing campaigns had a sign in his hand had had all kinds of uh Supernatural taking place but he never brought the the fullness of the mystery of God finished if he never brought the revelation of the coming of the son of man if he never turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers he would be disqualified for that office so that's why sometimes I find it discouraging in the message that we only refer to those things as that man and that's as far sometimes as our Revelation goes is God sent a prophet what was that Prophet sent for and what was he supposed to do and what does that mean to me now we're getting somewhere because there was a purpose behind it all now here's our question what does the Elijah of Malachi 4 how does the Elijah of Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children to the fathers in the church age book laodicean Church age now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7. he didn't make them two different Messengers that's one messenger now the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals now listen here we go here's the punch line it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so how's he going to do it by showing a sign in his hand how's he going to do it by showing the sermon no he's trying to attract the attention of the rainbow trout and get them to come near and listen to him that's what all that was about but how is he going to do it he's going to do it by revealing the mystery truths that are contained in the Seven Seals which are literally the revelations under the seals so how how does he turn the hearts of the children to the fathers where am I through revelation 10. that's how he does it which is the revealing of the mystery truths that's according to the prophet how he accomplishes and fulfills the prophecy of Malachi 4. you see what emphasis we should put on the seals and my emphasis we should put on the third poem what emphasis we should put on the Mysteries review what emphasis we should put on the seventh seal right this is why standing in the pulpit and just rehearsing the ministry of brother Branham and the supernatural science and telling all the stories it that will not catch the rainbow trout it can attract the rainbow trout and so there's times for that there's times that that is important there's time that it's needed there's times that that is useful because we still want to attract the fish we're still calling the elect we're still drawing their attention but that's why when we just stand up and just rehearse brother Benham did this and brother Benham did that and brother Venom did this and the supernatural was here and the supernatural was there and God did this miracle and God did that miracle that's wonderful that may draw the coven efficient but how will you hook them and land them in the gospel net it's going to take revelation 10. it's going to take the revealing of the mystery truths that's how it's done I read that again just so we lock it in as you're reading the board this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 you will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so let's go to Daniel chapter 12. something important that I want to look at here because I also want to understand this statement how were the third pool the opening of the seals the sounding of the Thunders the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed these are all synonymous terms how will that literally turn the heart to the children to the Pentecostal fathers let's begin to look in Daniel chapter 12. verse 4. but thou will Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end and many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased then I Daniel looked and behold there stood two other one on I'm sorry I don't want to read on I just want to stop with that seal up the book now I want to go down to verse 8. let's jump down to verse 8. it says and I heard but I understood not then said I O Lord oh my Lord what shall be the end of thee what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end so there was a revelation there was a mystery of what God was going to do even with the nation of of Israel and God was showing what will be the end of these matters and he began to see Envision but he did not understand and he asked and he said God what what is the meaning of this when shall these things be he said go thy Way Daniel for the vision is sealed up until the time of the end so that means this is a sealed vision of what God will do and how God will transpire these things to the end and I that is all sealed up but it's not sealed up forever it's sealed up to a particular time and the word tells us that these things are sealed up until the time of the end so that tells us that there's a marker here that if these things ever get revealed then we'll know we're at the end time the minute that this was what's laid secret in the Bible what's been unreviewed what's been unspoken what's been Undeclared what's been sealed up when it becomes unsealed that is the stamped that's the marker we are now at the end time because you know there was prophecies laying in the Bible amen Prophecies of Joel Prophecies of David types and shadows All Through the Bible when we come to the day of Pentecost amen and and Jesus had died he had resurrected amen he had shown himself to disciples he had raised again they knew that Jesus was the Messiah they knew that he had died they knew he raised again they they knew he was on the right hand of power they knew all of these things but yet they were waiting for something amen they were waiting for a designation for a marker for a happening for an event to launch them into their Ministry and so they were waiting for 10 days in the upper room amen but then all of a sudden the promise of the fathers came the Fulfillment of the scripture amen the prophecy now come into manifestation and when that happened amen The Men Who were frightened before the men who who were discouraged and unsure and uncertain and all of these things that were going on now all of a sudden they were filled with the spirit of God they changed with a boldness they ran out into the street and with a boldness they proclaimed this is nothing but the word of God this is that and this is this and this is that and now they were taking the word and they were placing it what happened to their faith when they realized this is the scripture fulfilled this is the prophecy come this is the marker of time now it's not a prophecy now it's a happening it's no longer a prophecy it's a reality it's a manifestation the prophecy is now real what did it do to them it increased their faith it gave them lying like boldness it gave him the ability to go out in the face of everything and now declare the truth who were hiding before now the Spirit came according to the word and they were men that were bold they knew who they were they knew their position they knew what they were supposed to do and now there's something that's going to come under the revelation of the Seven Seals under the sounding of the seven Thunders under the third pool under the revealing of the Mysteries under the seventh Angels Ministry that will bring us back to that same faith what is it it's the revealing of the Mysteries what do you mean brother Chad it's the time date stamp marker you are here you are here and if you can receive it you are it and it brings us right back to the faith of the fathers now I know this is the day for prophecy to be filled modern events May clear by prophecy that is this what you see now is that prophecy being fulfilled amen when he promised that he would have a bride he's having a bride right now when he promised he would wash her with the water of the word the washing is taking place right now this is that we know who we are when the spirit was held back because the word was held back through the nominational rivers but in the evening time it's to be loosed by the evening time message the Holy Ghost back and the people again why there's no more false teaching barrier there's no more misunderstanding barrier but now when the word the revelation of the word comes back it unlocks and unbinds the moving of the spirit to come back and make us what it intended to make us in the beginning he said You shall be endued with power from on high and ye shall be my Witnesses what are we his Witnesses that this is that this is the end time this is beyond Pentecost laodicea has failed it's gone into apostasy it's an absolute blackout God showed in the heavens above there's no light there anymore it's blacked out under Church apostasy the church is there but the bride has been called out of that because laodicea has failed and there's not one good statement made in your Bible about laodicea in every age you can see an accommodation and you can see a rebuke say you've held your first love or you've held to the work you've lost your first love it's always he's why because he's speaking to two Vines but when he comes to laodicea because this will be revealed at the end time when he comes to laodicea he has nothing good to say about laodicea and you tell me his bride is there amen under that church and he has nothing good to say about it where is Christ at the end of the Legacy in churches he's on the outside knocking that's why brother men and preached going beyond the camp now we've got to go beyond the camp of religion on the camp of denomination go beyond the walls of religion and go out and be United with the one that's been pushed out what's been pushed out the word amen so what is the revealing of the seven Thunders it's revealing of what's been sealed up in the Bible all this time waiting for the end time to be revealed and in the end time who will reveal it it'll come through a prophet but it will be revealed by Jesus Christ but it'll take a profit on the scene but to me I think the biggest question is who will it be revealed to and here in May lie the greatest mystery of all the Mysteries not who will he reveal it through but who will he reveal it to and if you can catch the revelation of that secret all of a sudden it'll change you change the way you think change the way you feel change everything about you amen brother Venom says in the church age book and the laodicean church age he says it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth did you catch that it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth then he quotes Revelations 10 3-4 that we just read said what was in those Thunders listen close what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know no one knows but we need to know you can't just say nobody knows it's a mystery brother Branham says we need to know and it will take a profit to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet and questions and answers in 64 he says have the question comes have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet brother Brown says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that means the preaching of the Seven Seals they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about what is the Thunder's about it's about the seals it's the Revelation that was contained in the seals when the seals came forth they came forth in a symbol for him to go out to the church for 2000 years as a symbol amen but what the symbols represented that was the mystery hid under the Thunders amen and the Thunders revealed the seals amen let's keep reading they were revealing the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one can make it out John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of a sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age William Branham praise God so in the days of that sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed which means we're in the end time which means if you can receive it that must make you the end time bride not a church age bride this is an end time bride not a previous age bride not not a bride that came up through a partial Revelation like Lutheran like Wesley and like Pentecost this is not now this is the end time meaning now it's time for an end time bride that's right brother Branham attached this Revelation with the end time and the people made for this Revelation as the end time people are the end time bride it doesn't mean there wasn't Pentecostal brine it wasn't uh you know every other age had bride but this is end time bride and it takes an end time message to wake up the end time bride to bring the bride to her Revival her Awakening was going to come under this word in the breach he says this is right at the beginning of the seals when the seals are broken the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ sitting setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming that was Revelations 10 1 and a mighty I saw a mighty Angel descend from heaven amen with a book in his hand amen and it gave the description and brother Branham tells us we'll read that in a minute that that's Christ that's the true Messenger that's Christ not coming in his body that was pierced it's not that this is this is a great Mighty Angel this is a spiritual coming or you could say an invisible coming but the question is is invisible real are we waiting for it to be real or is it real is this opening of the seals amen the silence attached to the seven Thunders have the seven Thunders utter their voices yes it was the seals if the seven Thunders uttered their voices amen then then all of a sudden now we've come to this great mystery which is what the coming of the Lord and brother Branham says the angel of the seventh angel will be on Earth at the time of this coming of this Mighty Angel which is Christ amen praise be to God the seventh angels on Earth time of this coming which is attached to the seventh seal which is attached to the silence which is attached to what wasn't written of what the seven Thunder spoke they all go together why because brother Branham could not open the seals brother Branham could not preach the seals unless Christ came down and revealed to him what was under those seals what those seven Thunders uttered that's why when brother bam I said before when he comes to the end of the seals he says don't say thank you to any man no man had anything to do with this he goes I was just as unsure of what those seals was as you or maybe anybody else but if he hadn't come I would have made a terrible mistake praise God amen again in the breach a couple paragraphs down says now we see that this seven sealed book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God now all the Mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now here's here's the angel on Earth and another Angel Mighty messenger come down this Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger But Here Comes one down from heaven a rainbow Covenant only Christ it could be who's this messenger in Revelation 10 1 he said only Christ it could be when does he come at the time the seventh angel is on Earth let's go to First Peter 1 13. my goodness I just about got excited I looked down here and somebody changed his clock there's a little clock here that tells me what time it is but somehow it got changed and it bounces between the date and the time now so I looked down and said 9 11. I'm thinking I've got hours to preach then I looked again at changed I said oh dear lord I'm in trouble I thought I was doing really good I'm going backwards in time First Peter 1 13. wherefore good up gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ what's coming to us a Grace is coming to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ what is the opening of the seals it's the revealing of Christ what's coming to you Grace at the revelation of Jesus Christ in Zechariah we know the ministry was Aruba was to rebuild the Temple and it says who art thou a great Mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone there with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it brother bear says double Grace amen there is an extra measure of Grace that's coming at the revelation of Jesus Christ which is what the opening of the seals and the revelation of the seventh seal he said in future home he says yes become become a part of the word a part of the word of today can't be a part of the word of Moses day that part is done made up that was the feat we're at the head now this is Christ not the arms time back in Luther this is the head time Christ The Headstone comes to the body praise God in John 1 1 I'm going to just quote it to you because you know it by heart in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God then verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we know that was Jesus Christ coming into Earthly manifestation so the word of God is God come from God is part of God it's the thoughts of God being expressed and now that word can take on flesh and the fullness of the word took on flesh in Jesus Christ so Christ was the word made flesh and I want to deal with that for just a few moments in in the message modern events make clear by prophecy all of these quotes are coming from 63 64 and 65 and I'm completely unashamed to say that because that's when he began to declare his message at the opening of the seals so it doesn't mean that there's nothing of value pre-seals many of the things he taught post deals he taught pre-seals the Teaching Ministry went on before there could be no ladder rain without the Teaching Ministry so the I take great value in everything that was preached before but he began to declare his message at the opening of the seals and this is the third pool and this is what gets the rainbow trout so I'm unashamed to labor in post-seal's quotes because that is the bride's message it all goes together I I believe that I agree with it amen but he began to declare his message and really declare it clearly and by the time he comes in 1965 he's just saying it now amen he's declaring it more and more clearly all the time so in modern events made clear by prophecy he says but he said all I'll meet them in one place the place I put my name that's in Jesus Christ that's where God puts his name that's the only place he'll meet you and it's Christ the word oh I want you to catch that there's one place he'll meet you there's one provided place that he put his name where did he put his name he put it in Jesus Christ he said that's where God put his name we all believe that he said that's the only place he'll meet you and it's Christ is the word the same yesterday it's growing from the feet the thighs and now in the head fixing to go manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom but if I'm saying he's only going to meet you in the place he puts his name and he put his name in Jesus Christ because all the family in Heaven and Earth is named that name we agree but he doesn't limit it to Jesus when he was in the fleshly form The Man from Nazareth he doesn't stop there he says it's Christ the word that's where he put his name wherever the word is Manifest it's a manifestation of the name of God where was the word is made manifest it's Christ it's Jesus Christ the word made flesh and there's where he plays his name and that's where he'll meet you that's why we have sometimes people who are trying to meet Jesus Christ in a previous age in a previous form in a previous way amen but he has a place today a meeting place where he put his name and that name is in Jesus Christ it's Christ the word and the word is present it's here it's been open it's revealed it's been delivered he's here now I'm going to read just one sentence quotes and all of these are out of 64 and 65 and maybe 63. he said if you're married to Christ Christ is the word of God so if you're married to Christ you're married to the word and Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest you got that Christ is the word the anointed word may manifest and what are you married to the anointed word may manifest praise be to God Christ is the word and when we are in the word we're in Christ and how can I be in Christ denying Christ how can I be in Christ and deny this Revelation the prophet God Amen how can I deny the word if I'm in Christ amen but if I'm in if I'm in the word I'm in Christ he said you're born into the word for you're born into Christ Christ is the word yes sir each one in its age amen amen so what word do I have to be born into the word for my age he says and and with the age that we're living in when the word is interpreted God's speaking that word out and making the word for that age live giving the interpretation of it that it's God in Christ manifesting sin because Christ is the word and when the word is made manifest that is Christ in every age then so where is Christ he's the word made manifest for this age and if a man is born of the spirit of God he'll search the scriptures to see if it's the answer for today the answer of the day is Christ that should have been a good question what is the answer of the day the answer of the day is Christ what is Christ Christ is the anointed word for your day the answer of the day is Christ Christ is the word when the word comes to life it shows the light that's promised of the day see how brother Branham is never saying you can go previous and find Christ he's not ever saying that he's never saying you can go back up here and you can find him if you want to find him don't find him where he was find him where he is you're here now he's here now find him now when you begin to teach that people begin to accuse you of no longer preaching the cross how can you preach Christ and not preach the cross it's included today amen I don't have to go back to Luther's day to believe justification neither do I have to go back to Wesley's day to believe and say so I mean why how can you claim that if you need if you want to be saved in this day and you want to be saved from tribulation and go in the Rapture that you have to meet Christ for your day for that salvation and somebody says you're not preaching Calvary are you kidding I could never preach this without Calvary Calvary is what made it all possible without Calvary I can't say what I'm saying today Calvary is the foundation and then Calvary took place 2 000 years ago but reality Calvary took place in eternity in the mind of God Amen it's always been based on Calvary but you know I can preach Calvary and not Point people to Christ if I point them away from where he is now so it goes both ways if I reject Christ and I tell people don't go there that's false that's a lie and I say go here have I led them to Christ if the thing that I deny is the manifestation of Christ for our day I can point them to another manifestation and they'll find Christ I don't understand that he's here he's present he's in this day he's here in the end time the mighty Angel has come down he says if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can only point you to Christ and Christ is the word I like it I believe it and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize any other headship no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word remember he says if you married to Christ Christ is the word he says and how will the Messiah the people that believe on him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is Daniel said the wife shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their their God now now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen if you want to be revealed to your mate you must be revealed to you must be um what am I saying when she wants to know her mate you want to know your mate you must be introduced to the revealed word because the revealed word is the mate of the end time bride you can see you can be you can be introducing somebody to an idea and that's not Christ you can be introducing people to a concept and it may not cry it can have the label of Jesus Christ but it may not be Jesus Christ because it's our concept of Jesus Christ but in order to introduce somebody to Jesus Christ I must introduce to them to the revealed word that's who the bride must be introduced that's who she must know that's who her mate is who's my mate my mate is Jesus Christ who's Jesus Christ the revealed word the end time revelation says in recognizing your day in this message now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force will put the church and the World Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God I want you to catch that the spirit of God which is the word of God don't separate these two things I want the spirit I want the spirit I want the spirit then get the word get the word get the word if we chase after the Spirit by denying the revealed word What Spirit are we going to get right but if we want more of the spirit we need more of the word if we want more of the power of God let's get more of the revelation of the hour amen the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place so what will the spirit of God do it'll put the bride in her place what is the spirit of God the word of God he says the spirit of God which is the word of God which is my word of spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place how's the bride going to get to her position it's going to be the revelation of Christ the revelation of the word that was in those seven Thunders that's in the mystery and the silence amen that Revelation is coming to a bride to put her in position what do you mean put in position where will I stand will it Lift Me Up what part what no put you in position is where you recognize who you are for your day you recognize by the Revelation you are the end time bride that spirit that comes with that word puts you in position you begin to act like an end time bride praise be to God she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place says the church across the nation we're following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride who wants to be in the bride to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ which means the old husband the old life has to be dead all the denominations all the Traditions all the false everything through the previous ages it all has to die it has to rot it has to be left behind amen you have to be a new creature you have to be remarried to the word of God to be in the bride I've said this before but I'll say it again what makes you and I bride there's so many times we I mean we say we're bride we're bride we're bride this is another one of those terms you know we use terms over and over again we're in the bride this is a bride Church a bride's message a bride this and that but when it comes down to it what makes you brine and the reality of what makes you and I bride is the bridegroom without the bridegroom you and I are not bride so what is the main effect I mean what is the main cause of you being brought is the bridegroom amen the presence of the bridegroom when you amen have received that invitation to be United with him your bride amen that's what makes you bright you can't self-declare bride no woman in the world can self-declare herself bride what makes her a bride is because she has a bridegroom because she has a bridegroom she's now a bride if I want to be bride I need a bridegroom and who's my bridegroom the revealed word my mate so I had to be United with one the revealed word for this day to be part of the end time bride I can't say I'm bride saying bride doesn't make me bride I said I want to be a bride I mean there's a lot of young women that walk around and want to be a bride but that doesn't make them a bride they need some man to make them a bride and no matter how much the church wants to be bride it takes some man to make you bright and that man is Christ Jesus the revealed word for today which is the third pool which is the seventh seal which is the mystery of God revealed now this is the final part I keep looking at 9 11. and it just does my heart good every time and then it changes again somebody's going to have to fix this for me so I don't get lost because next month is going to be 10 something and I'm going to think I just got started 10 30. this is the beginning all right now now we know we know what the message is according what the prophet told us and I say what I wrote down is not static it's Dynamic it means that and it compasses so many other terms we know how the Elijah of Malachi 4 will turn the hearts of the children I want to look at another question now if I could write this what does the bride feed on so we're going to look at what the prophet says let's go to John chapter 6 and we'll begin with what Jesus says John chapter 6. verse 32. in John chapter 6 verse 32 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven he's typing this with manna that fell now he's showing himself the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth his life into the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst let's go down to verse 41. the Jews then yeah the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven so now they didn't like that now let's go to verse 53. then said Jesus unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever so what are we supposed to eat we are supposed to eat Jesus Christ he says You Eat My Flesh and drink my blood my flesh is meat that's food indeed and my blood is drink indeed and if you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have everlasting life so what does the what does the bride feed on she feeds on the body and blood of the Lord so when we take communion communion is symbolic and it's a reference back a remembrance to what Christ did for us when he paid the price of redemption at Calvary amen and those elements are not the literal elements of his body and of his blood but the representation of the body which was given for us and the blood which given for us and we know that the body was the word made flesh so the body was the manifested word the body that was broken for us it was a word made flesh and the blood that was shed for us we realized the blood symbolizes the life because the life of everything is in the blood amen so what we have now and when we eat his flesh and drink his blood we have the word made flesh and the life of that word the life of God together and it said unless you eat this and drink this you have no life in you let's look at uh I'm just going to reference to you this in in Mark chapter 14 that the Last Supper Jesus says As they did eat Jesus Took bread and blessed and break it and gave it to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of of the new new testament which is shed for many now he's telling them once again eat my this is my body which is given for you that bread is not it it's a symbol it's symbolizing that you have to feed on Christ you have to drink from Christ you have to feed on the word made flesh and you have to drink from the life here's what here's what brother Branham says now this is Anointed ones at the end time 1965. he says you couldn't feed Methodist Lutheran message oh no he didn't want that to carry him it's rotten why because the because the message cannot be carried over from a previous day remember we went through this principle it cannot be a carryover amen that gets maggots in it it gets worms and the Mana that fell fresh that morning amen there's new Mana that has to fall the next morning the Passover Lamb that you feasted on couldn't be carried to the next day had to be consumed amen so there has to be a fresh message every day so this is why he says you cannot feed the you could not feed the Methodist the Lutheran message you can't feed them that they have to have a fresh message for themselves why because by the time it carried over brother when I said it had wiggle tails in it what's that the ideas of man mingled in corruption had come in he said you couldn't feed Methodist Lutheran message oh no he didn't want that carry and it's rotten the life had done left and it went into something else that's the old stock that's dead back there the life was moving on neither can you feed the bride of Christ Pentecostalism no indeedy maggot blowed organizations nothing doing no no just as much as you could not feed a Wesleyan a Luther message you could not feed a Pentecostal a Wesley a message you cannot feed the bride the Pentecostal message you cannot feed them the laodicean message the Pentecostal message you cannot feed him that was the restoration of the gifts that message was good for its time but it will not carry over this is beyond that the prophet said so we can't just replicate and re-teach the same thing same quote you're an annoying ones at the end time you cannot feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism so for the promise is and before that great and terrible day shall come I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet he will restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers again all these promises had been made in the Bible I will do it and there the Eagles will gather all that the father hath given me will come to me where will the Eagles gather the Eagles will gather over the fresh kill of the word brother Benham said where the word the Manna is fresh freshly killed for this day it doesn't have magnets it doesn't have flies it doesn't have wiggle tails in it and where it's flesh it has the Flesh Blood because it's freshly killed again anointing ones he says it's not a man it's gone the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man what are you supposed to feed on Jesus Christ the son of man that's what this message is the Revelation amen the real message that the messenger came to declare what is it it's the body word of the son of man just as much as Jesus in his day said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood brother branham's come to the same point he says you better be eating the son of man and you can be just as confused in the carnal as they were that day how do I eat this man and drink his blood he's not talking natural he's talking spiritual and now brother Branham says you're not feeding on the words of a man because the bride has to feed on something and she can't feed on the previous message so what's she feeding on she's feeding on the body word of the son of man I say we better feed right here and the message the seat is not air with the shock neither will a Christian eat on that dead akarians from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu for all the Seven Seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive it what are we supposed to feed the bride not previous aged message we're supposed to feed the bride the seven course meal the opening of The Seven Seals the sounding of the seven Thunders the revealing of the son of man amen that's why Brother people come and say Christ is the mystery of God revealed why because under the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished which is what declaring Christ what is those seals those SEALS or Christ what is the revealing of the seals revealing Christ he is the seals that was revealed if I want to feed on the body word of the son of man I better feed on this revelation of this message and if I want to feed God sheep sheep food I better be feeding them this message not what he started out with not the healings but when he began to declare his message when Malachi 4 amen was fulfilled in Revelation 10 1-7 declaring the silence that was in Revelations 8 1. that's the food we need to feed on brother Benham said if you haven't fed fully on this word to Fly Above these denominations I invite you to do so now well it'll give us the strength to spread our wings and fly away from every other voice and every other thing it'll be the strength that we get from feeding on this Christ amen so what do we what does the bride feed on Christ and I can take one of brother branham's definitions straight from the quote I believe what is the bride feed on she feeds on Christ and brother Brandon said Christ is the anointed word for the day now let's go back to the beginning and I'll give you the rest of my title the bride's Revival is you could write many things and be absolutely correct but to me the bride's Revival is that's my Revival the bride's Revival is Christ is the seals that was revealed what is the revealing of the seals it's the revealing of Christ what is the manna that came down from heaven Christ what is the body word of the son of man Christ what what was the mystery contained under those seals of Christ what is the mystery of God Christ what is the Bible Christ what is the bride's Revival Christ if we want to have a Revival we don't need to go back anywhere else to previous Revival if we want a Revival let's keep moving towards Christ that brings the Awakening of the Bride that brings her into position that gives her food to Fly Above these denominations that gives her strength to take a Rapture she's not taking a Rapture listen if a previous message would have brought a rapture we don't need this message if previous teaching would bring us really a Spirit-filled life then we don't need the previous teaching we don't need this teaching because what we need is a Spirit-filled life but none of that teaching was good enough to produce what's needed to be the end time bride so God would bring an end-time message when what's been sealed will be unsealed so that we have something to feed on that will take us higher and higher and higher until it takes us to the change of our bodies this is what we should be feeding on not maggot infested previous message that's meant to be left

amen that was revealed that mystery that had been laying the mystery of redemption have been laying in those seven Thunders when Christ come the mighty Angel he come to bring the word back and make it available to the bride and that's what we're feeding on that's what will take us in a Rapture because it'll take a revelation what revelation the revelation of what happened long ago know the
