TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is always about God's spirit upon or in man. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has got to do with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the difference between father and holy spirit? The holy spirit has got to do with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit. And you you may have heard this the word ruak. Have you heard that? Which means breath or wind. Do you know the word ghost is in the Old Testament? And Abraham gave up the ghost. &gt;&gt; And that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a completely different to which is spirit. Two separate words. One is ghost, one is spirit. Starts giving us more clues. Right? So in the Greek which is now the new testament they didn't have this word ghost which is English it comes from the German word ghast g a s t which eventually came to be ghost but then what is a ghost &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word ghost? &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of someone who has died. which is made visible. &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost. &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when it's visible, it's ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they were writing. &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you that. &gt;&gt; Right. So it's the same thing, but not the same. There it is. We just have to understand what the meaning was. Right? So, uh, ghast in the old English means a spirit that can physically be seen. Like, well, you know, people will say, "What's the matter with you? You look like you saw a ghost." &gt;&gt; You've heard that. &gt;&gt; You look like you've seen a ghost. Uh, and in the old English, there would be the word apparition. &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should have been invisible became visible to you. &gt;&gt; So, basically, it's so simple. It has much more to do with the change in dispensation because what it was showing was that the spirit of God, the spirit of Christ was becoming visible upon the people. &gt;&gt; And they called that the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because they began to see his spirit becoming visible. How? Because they know what these men were doing was not their own spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon them and they called it the ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation brought forth change in manifestations of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen.
