[15:01] but the lord laid it heavy on my heart
[15:03] and uh we'll just press forward and ask
[15:05] god to
[15:07] give his divine wisdom and leadership
[15:09] first peter chapter
[15:11] and verse 13
[15:16] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[15:18] be sober
[15:19] and hope to the end for the grace that
[15:21] is to be brought unto you at the
[15:22] revelation of jesus christ
[15:25] as obedient children not fashioning
[15:26] yourselves according to the former lust
[15:28] and your ignorance
[15:29] but as he which hath called you as holy
[15:32] so be
[15:33] holy in all manner of conversation
[15:36] because it is written be holy for i am
[15:39] holy
[15:40] amen hold on to your place there as we
[15:42] pray i also want to let you know that
[15:44] brother mike allen and his family are up
[15:45] in ontario this morning
[15:47] ministering in a church up there and
[15:49] we'll be driving back this evening
[15:50] so just keep them in your prayers as
[15:52] well let's pray
[15:55] heavenly father we thank you god for the
[15:57] privilege of being here lord
[15:59] for the privilege of gathering together
[16:00] with saints of like precious faith
[16:03] to hear your word lord preached and we
[16:05] pray now that
[16:06] as we've prepared our hearts we've
[16:07] prepared ourselves we've done all that
[16:09] the prophet told us to do
[16:10] and we're standing here lord expecting
[16:12] you to speak now
[16:14] we've come lord to hear from you and we
[16:15] pray that you would take preeminence and
[16:17] speak
[16:18] your words through these lips of clay
[16:20] that you would hear
[16:21] lord through these ears lord that we
[16:23] would be able to receive the word that
[16:24] you have for us this morning
[16:26] we ask your special blessing over
[16:28] everything we say and do
[16:29] in jesus christ's name we pray lord
[16:32] before we're seated we pray you bless
[16:33] our brother mike allen and his family
[16:35] keep them safe on the road and anoint
[16:37] him lord to preach the word
[16:39] inspire him lord that he'd be able to
[16:40] preach exactly what you have for the
[16:42] needs that are there
[16:43] we commit all things into your name in
[16:45] jesus christ's name we pray
[16:47] amen you can all be seated
[16:51] amen before i
[16:55] start in too far you know i want to get
[16:58] entitled again influenced by the word
[17:00] and not the world
[17:02] amen and i appreciated the song sister
[17:04] naomi saying
[17:06] and i believe that song was right on
[17:07] time inspired of the lord
[17:10] amen i had a conversation with the
[17:12] brother on monday
[17:14] and we were talking and i was just
[17:15] sharing with him the burden in my heart
[17:17] and i say sometimes i feel i feel as
[17:21] though there are times that
[17:23] that where we're calling out and crying
[17:25] out for an individual walk crying out
[17:28] for a shaving off to the world
[17:29] a sincerity and a dedication a higher
[17:32] level than we've ever had before and
[17:34] and i'm afraid sometimes that that if we
[17:36] don't tune in if we don't catch things
[17:38] on a spiritual level
[17:39] we just think things sometimes are a
[17:41] little legalistic or
[17:42] a little bit of nagging and and if i
[17:45] could just share the burden on my heart
[17:47] it was what naomi sang she's saying
[17:50] exactly what god's been dealing with me
[17:52] in my heart
[17:53] and i i said to this to this brother
[17:55] this way i painted a word picture
[17:57] i said it's as if you know the ministry
[18:00] screaming out
[18:01] be in line stay in step don't partake of
[18:04] the world
[18:05] shave off entertainment and and and
[18:08] we're still
[18:09] in a grassy field blue sunshine pretty
[18:12] blue sky
[18:13] flying kites and having picnics and
[18:15] everything's okay
[18:16] so we don't realize the the intensity of
[18:19] the hour
[18:20] because right around us everything's
[18:21] fine
[18:23] but in my spirit i can see the clouds
[18:26] i see him amen i can see the lightning
[18:29] flash i
[18:30] know it's coming i know the hour is
[18:32] arriving
[18:33] i know it's time like she said the
[18:34] showdown is coming i don't know if it's
[18:37] months
[18:37] years 10 years decades i have no idea
[18:40] but my in my spirit i know it's coming
[18:42] and i see the little kid flying the kite
[18:45] and i'm yelling out a warning
[18:48] nothing's happening everything's fine
[18:51] it's fine now it won't always be fine
[18:56] and so i when she's saying that song i
[18:58] thought that's just exactly where god's
[19:00] dealing with me
[19:01] right where my heart is god is trying to
[19:04] prepare his bride for what's coming
[19:06] and it's not a scary thing don't think
[19:09] because i said that it's scary it's not
[19:10] a scary thing
[19:11] it's a proving time it won't be a
[19:14] frightful time it won't be a scary time
[19:16] it'll be frightening to the world but
[19:17] for the bride this is proving time
[19:19] this is the hour she's been prepared for
[19:22] this is the moment that everything
[19:24] that's been prophesied
[19:25] and everything that's been talked about
[19:27] is going to come to a culmination
[19:30] everything's going to come to a head and
[19:31] what you've seen temporarily will be
[19:33] manifest in the fullness of his power
[19:35] but look at every time the spoken word
[19:38] was manifest
[19:39] it was in the hour of need
[19:42] jesus broke bread when when they needed
[19:44] food
[19:46] amen he told peter to cast a line in and
[19:49] hook a fish and bring out when he needed
[19:51] a coin
[19:52] amen god doesn't clown god never played
[19:54] around
[19:55] he didn't use the supernatural as a
[19:57] gimmick as a show
[19:59] they didn't use it to attract the world
[20:02] but the spoken word and the supernatural
[20:04] always come at a time of
[20:06] need and when there was a time of need
[20:07] the supernatural showed up
[20:10] amen elijah smote the syrian army blind
[20:13] not for fun not for a gimmick because he
[20:15] was in an hour of need because he was
[20:17] surrounded and they come to destroy him
[20:20] god doesn't play with these things but
[20:22] the manifestations come
[20:24] they will come they're prophesied they
[20:26] will be here but they will be here in an
[20:28] hour of need just like every single time
[20:32] in the scripture
[20:33] he parted the red sea not for a show he
[20:36] parted the red sea because of a need
[20:40] because they were they were ready to be
[20:42] destroyed
[20:45] do you understand these things
[20:48] that god's doing they're not for
[20:49] showmanship god is not into showmanship
[20:53] amen he separated the jordan because
[20:55] they had a need
[20:58] all these things were done to meet a
[21:00] need so if what we've seen
[21:02] temporarily will be manifest in the
[21:04] fullness of its power
[21:05] that means if there's coming a great
[21:06] manifestation of the full life
[21:09] the full power of jesus christ it'll
[21:11] come in an hour of need where nothing
[21:13] but the full manifestation will do
[21:16] so you do the equation in your mind what
[21:19] kind of atmosphere will that be
[21:21] if it's going to take the full life of
[21:23] jesus christ on this plane the full
[21:25] measure of his power
[21:26] then what kind of condition will be in
[21:29] the world in that day
[21:31] because god's not showing he's not
[21:33] playing it's not a game
[21:35] [Music]
[21:37] so i can see at times people are getting
[21:40] frustrated
[21:41] because you're picking on my hobby and
[21:43] you're picking on my love
[21:45] but you don't understand you're
[21:47] whistling in the graveyard
[21:50] don't understand this isn't the hour for
[21:52] games
[21:54] this isn't the time for playing you know
[21:57] we're not walking around morbid and you
[21:58] know we're excited
[22:00] we still enjoy our family we're still
[22:02] playing with the kids and that's not
[22:03] what i mean
[22:04] but it's time to become aware and start
[22:08] shaving off everything that's not
[22:10] necessary
[22:12] everything that's not of the kingdom to
[22:14] let it fall
[22:16] to make sure they were influenced by the
[22:18] word and not the world
[22:23] brother branham says in 1958 his wonders
[22:26] to perform
[22:28] actually i want to back up i want to
[22:30] read this scripture again if you don't
[22:31] mind
[22:32] just read it to keep it fresh in our
[22:34] minds wherefore gird up the loins of
[22:36] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[22:38] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[22:40] you at the revelation of jesus christ
[22:42] as obedient children not fashioning
[22:44] ourselves according to the former lust
[22:46] in your ignorance
[22:47] but as he which hath called you as holy
[22:50] so you be
[22:51] holy in all manner of conversation that
[22:54] means manner of life
[22:55] manner of conversation is the way you
[22:56] live so be holy
[22:59] in all manner of your life
[23:02] all not just around the other believers
[23:07] not just when i'm at church not just
[23:08] when i'm doing spiritual things
[23:10] but all manners of conversation
[23:14] because it is written be holy for i am
[23:17] holy
[23:18] we're supposed to be a reflection
[23:21] he says in his wonders to perform 1958
[23:25] it was while those who went to emmaus
[23:27] along the road began to talk about him
[23:29] that he stepped out of the bushes and
[23:31] walked with him through the day
[23:32] the reason we don't have the spiritual
[23:34] blessings we have too much
[23:36] time to watch television too much time
[23:38] to read the newspaper or listen to
[23:40] something that we ought not to listen to
[23:42] and we are not redeeming the time but
[23:44] we're giving it to the things of the
[23:46] world instead of our time to the lord
[23:47] jesus
[23:49] and the bible said that man shall not
[23:50] live by bread alone but by
[23:52] every word that proceedeth out of the
[23:53] mouth of god christians
[23:55] live on the word
[23:58] amen not entertainments not pleasures
[24:01] of the world not pleasures of this life
[24:04] christians live
[24:04] on the word amen
[24:08] brother bam said you know when they were
[24:10] talking about him he drew near
[24:11] he said it's always when you're talking
[24:13] about him you know you realize
[24:15] that that's what we should be doing all
[24:17] the time we should be meditating and him
[24:20] talking about him
[24:21] talking to him listening to his word
[24:24] reading his word
[24:25] i mean we live in a world where we're
[24:26] bombarded by messages
[24:28] every day all day i mean this is satan's
[24:30] eden and everything you come in contact
[24:32] with is perverted and defiled
[24:35] everything everything's perverted and
[24:38] defiled it doesn't matter how clean it
[24:40] looks there's a perversion behind it
[24:41] because this is satan's eden
[24:43] amen all the advertisements everything
[24:45] you hear the conversations around you
[24:47] it's all perverted and if we're going to
[24:51] spend
[24:51] all day every day in satan's eden amen
[24:54] in order to make sure that
[24:56] influence is not taking over in our
[24:58] lives and not getting a foothold
[24:59] we need more than just a casual
[25:02] observation of the word
[25:04] twice a week we need a daily diet of the
[25:08] word of god
[25:08] we need to be constantly on our mind in
[25:11] our meditation
[25:12] it will be an atmosphere of prayer and a
[25:13] communication with god all the time
[25:16] because the devil is always trying to
[25:17] get in don't forget
[25:19] when those two hundred thousand thousand
[25:21] demons were released out of the river
[25:22] for euphrates
[25:24] they went into the the armies of stalin
[25:27] mussolini
[25:28] stalin and hitler and then what did they
[25:30] do they brought a persecution against
[25:32] the jews
[25:33] in natural then after the war was over
[25:36] brother ben said they went into the
[25:37] ecclesiastical realms
[25:38] and now they're coming after the bride
[25:41] so 200
[25:42] 000 000 demons released into the
[25:44] ecclesiastical world
[25:46] to come after the bride amen how many
[25:48] bride do you think there are on the
[25:50] earth today
[25:52] it's probably less than you and i would
[25:54] even want to think about
[25:57] how many demons per bride
[26:04] i'm not even going to give a number how
[26:06] many demons per
[26:07] bride are there to what to shut you down
[26:10] to destroy you to kill you spiritually
[26:13] and they're constantly trying through
[26:14] every avenue
[26:15] every every window every doorway any way
[26:18] that they can get and they're trying to
[26:19] come in
[26:20] we have to be hyper vigilant in this
[26:22] hour
[26:24] and the only way we're going to do it is
[26:25] stay tied in tuned into the spirit of
[26:28] god
[26:29] and the spirit feeds on the word so to
[26:31] strengthen your spiritual life you have
[26:33] to have the word
[26:34] because the word is spirit it is life it
[26:37] is the same thing
[26:38] we have to have more not less more
[26:43] hallelujah we need to be devoted we need
[26:46] to be dedicated we need to be more
[26:50] sincere
[26:52] says in the message just one one more
[26:54] time lord 1963
[26:56] pentecost a few years ago years ago no
[26:58] more than 50 years ago stood out
[27:00] the people stood different they come out
[27:02] of a different groups of worldliness
[27:04] because of their worldliness and stood
[27:06] out as an example
[27:07] and goddess took the church and today
[27:09] it's one of the most powerful churches
[27:10] in the world
[27:11] but the thing that she's doing she's
[27:13] turned right straight back around and
[27:15] went back into the same conglomeration
[27:17] that she was called out of
[27:19] and when she begins to do that her power
[27:21] is taken from her
[27:23] where do we get the all-night prayer
[27:25] meeting let the preacher preach till
[27:27] about one or two o'clock in the morning
[27:28] like he used to i like quotes like this
[27:32] let him preach until one or two o'clock
[27:34] in the morning like he used to do
[27:36] he'd be preaching to empty seats they
[27:38] got to go home and see we love susie or
[27:41] somebody or
[27:41] certain television cast now that's the
[27:43] truth why where your treasure is there
[27:45] your heart is also
[27:47] our treasure ought to be the word
[27:50] the greatest treasure of our life ought
[27:53] to be the word
[27:54] the greatest desire we have should be
[27:57] for the word of god
[27:59] amen let's turn to hebrews together and
[28:01] look at hebrews
[28:03] chapter 12.
[28:14] keep your bibles handy we're going to
[28:16] hit several scriptures
[28:18] lord willing this morning hebrews
[28:20] chapter 12 and verse 14
[28:24] follow peace with all men and holiness
[28:26] without which no man shall see the lord
[28:29] this word holiness
[28:31] means consecration purification
[28:35] sanctification of heart and life so god
[28:39] is requiring holiness without which
[28:42] you'll never see god
[28:44] it's always been the standard and always
[28:47] will be the standard
[28:49] we're never going to mature out of
[28:50] holiness we should be maturing into
[28:52] holiness
[28:57] it should never be we used to be this
[28:59] way
[29:00] but now we're more mature shouldn't be
[29:03] that way
[29:08] 1959 what do us what does thou hear
[29:12] as brother buhler said about his sign in
[29:15] the back you become
[29:16] born again you become a new creature in
[29:18] christ old things have passed away
[29:20] the carnal things of the world has no
[29:21] more hold on you and you have no more
[29:24] hold on them
[29:27] it's a two-way street they'll let go of
[29:31] you
[29:31] but you've got to let go of it
[29:35] amen and you have no more hold on them
[29:37] when you've passed from death into life
[29:38] when god gets a hold of a man the first
[29:40] thing he does in the church is bring it
[29:42] from the worldliness
[29:43] to holiness and he brings it from death
[29:45] and to life it's born again
[29:47] praise be to god so god's bringing from
[29:49] worldliness
[29:50] to holiness but what do you think the
[29:54] 200
[29:54] 000 000 demons are trying to do
[29:57] amen let's go to first john together
[30:07] first john chapter 2
[30:12] and verse 15.
[30:20] first john 2 and 15 love not the world
[30:22] neither the things that are in the world
[30:25] if any man loves the world the love of
[30:27] the father is not in him
[30:29] for all that is in the world the lust of
[30:30] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[30:32] pride of life
[30:34] is not of the father but is of the world
[30:37] and the world passes away in the lust
[30:39] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[30:40] god
[30:41] abideth forever so we're not supposed to
[30:44] be motivated by our lusts
[30:46] unless the eyes lust the flesh and the
[30:49] pride of life
[30:50] remember it must be obedient unto god
[30:53] brother brahm says in 1956 vi azuza
[30:56] jubilee many times that we let the world
[30:59] slip
[31:00] in that's what's the matter with our
[31:02] churches today
[31:03] we kindly let down a little bit here and
[31:05] there the devil is coming from one place
[31:07] to the other
[31:08] taking a little bit slipping here just a
[31:10] little of this place here in a little
[31:12] place here
[31:13] and first thing you know it's got the
[31:14] whole thing in a confusion
[31:17] he doesn't come in with a big thing he
[31:20] comes in with a little thing
[31:22] slipped in just a little bit here and
[31:25] slipped in just a little bit there
[31:27] and a little bit here and a little bit
[31:29] there not on the same spot from over
[31:31] here and over there that's how brother
[31:32] branham describes it
[31:34] and he's he's preaching the jubilee year
[31:35] of azusa street and he's talking about
[31:37] the failure
[31:38] of the azusa street revival so just a
[31:41] little bit slipped in here a little bit
[31:42] slipped in there
[31:43] and next thing you know it brings
[31:44] confusion
[31:47] he said in the faith of abraham 1959
[31:51] and then when lot looked up begin to
[31:53] look over towards the jordan plains he
[31:55] seen they were well watered
[31:57] there was a big city there sodom gamora
[31:59] many of the cities plenty grass a
[32:01] possibility of making
[32:02] him a few dollars he chose that that's a
[32:05] way a mini a lot did a few dollars when
[32:07] he was looking at the well-watered
[32:09] planes
[32:09] he didn't see his wife turning to a
[32:11] pillar of salt
[32:13] there you go he didn't see
[32:16] the results of his actions
[32:20] he didn't see his wife turning to a
[32:22] pillar of salt he didn't see the fire
[32:23] that was going to destroy the city
[32:25] and part of his children he didn't see
[32:27] the disgrace that his daughters was
[32:28] going to do because raising them
[32:30] up in a bunch of worldliness like they
[32:32] were raised in
[32:35] that's what you look at today friends it
[32:37] depends on what you're looking at
[32:39] as i taught the other night we look at
[32:40] the unseen we look at god's promise and
[32:42] carry anything
[32:43] and call anything contrary to it as
[32:45] though it was not
[32:46] so lot had left abraham abraham was
[32:49] separated from worldliness
[32:51] abraham was living a separated life and
[32:53] lot in him had to separate
[32:55] because la abraham needed a greater
[32:58] separation than the separation he had
[33:02] he needed to separate not just from
[33:05] sodom and gomorrah
[33:06] not just from the land of the chaldees
[33:08] not just from ur but he had to separate
[33:10] from his own father
[33:11] and now he had to separate from lot his
[33:14] nephew
[33:15] because god couldn't visit him until he
[33:17] made that final separation
[33:19] and lot amen lot it says the
[33:22] he was a righteous man he said the sins
[33:24] and sodom vexed his righteous soul
[33:26] he didn't enjoy the sodom condition he
[33:29] vexed his righteous soul but yet he was
[33:32] willing to endure the sodom condition
[33:34] for gain lust of the flesh
[33:38] lust of the eyes pride of life he was
[33:41] willing to endure
[33:43] it vexed his righteous soul he didn't
[33:45] like it but he was willing to endure it
[33:47] for whatever he could gain amen but he
[33:49] didn't realize
[33:51] that that decision would cost him his
[33:53] wife would cost him his daughters
[33:55] amen would bring disgrace because he
[33:57] raised them in that bunch of worldliness
[33:59] he himself amen he himself still had a
[34:02] righteous heart
[34:05] but those around him were lost
[34:08] it matters what we do it matters what we
[34:12] look at
[34:13] it matters that we stay vigilant all the
[34:16] time
[34:18] let's turn to john the gospel of john
[34:21] chapter 17.
[34:35] john 17 and 13
[34:44] and now come i to thee and these things
[34:46] i speak in the world that they might
[34:48] have my joy fulfilled in themselves
[34:50] i have given them thy word and the world
[34:52] hath hated them because they are not of
[34:54] the world
[34:55] even as i am not of the world i pray not
[34:57] that thou should just take them
[34:59] out of the world but thou should keep
[35:01] them from the evil
[35:03] so jesus was declaring that his
[35:05] disciples were not of the world even as
[35:07] he was not of the world so the same way
[35:08] he was not of the world was the same way
[35:10] they were not of the world
[35:13] but he was praying that they wouldn't be
[35:14] taken out of the world they have to stay
[35:16] there
[35:17] amen we have to be here
[35:20] but he wanted them to be kept from the
[35:22] evil
[35:23] let's turn over to first corinthians
[35:27] first corinthians chapter 5.
[35:36] in verse 9.
[35:40] first corinthians 5 and 9.
[35:46] i wrote unto you in the epistle not to
[35:47] company with fornicators
[35:49] yet not all together with the
[35:50] fornicators of this world or with the
[35:52] covetous or extortioners
[35:54] or with idolaters for them must your
[35:56] needs go out of the world
[35:59] it says but now i've written unto you
[36:00] that you need not to keep company if any
[36:02] man that is called a brother
[36:04] be a fornicator or covetous or an
[36:06] adulterer or rail or a drunkard or
[36:08] extortioner
[36:09] with such a one no not to eat so now
[36:12] in the first and in the when he when he
[36:14] writes to the corinthians before
[36:16] he had told them not to keep company
[36:18] with fornicators or dollars on all of
[36:19] this
[36:20] but then he writes back a clarification
[36:22] he's saying i'm not
[36:23] saying that you can't keep somebody
[36:24] that's in the world he says if i told
[36:27] you that you would have to leave the
[36:28] world
[36:30] but if somebody's called a brother and
[36:31] they're doing these things don't eat
[36:33] with them separate from them
[36:35] because it's going to bring an influence
[36:36] in your life but but what he's showing
[36:39] is
[36:39] you can't you can't get out of this
[36:43] world
[36:44] you're supposed to be in this world but
[36:46] we're not of this world
[36:49] you're going to have to company with
[36:51] fornicators and adulterers if you're
[36:52] going to have a job
[36:54] if you're going to do anything you're
[36:56] going to have to company with
[36:57] fornicators idolaters extortioners
[36:59] drunkards all of these things
[37:00] you can't separate from the whole world
[37:03] but you can live a separated life
[37:04] in the midst of the world
[37:08] abraham lived a separated life in the
[37:11] midst of the world
[37:12] abraham lived on the plains of memory
[37:14] but abraham had interactions with the
[37:16] world he had interactions with the
[37:17] bemalek and then he he
[37:19] even signed a peace treaty with
[37:20] abimelech he even
[37:22] fought for the kings of sodom and
[37:23] gomorrah and the kings that round about
[37:25] and delivered them
[37:26] had interactions it wasn't that abraham
[37:28] had left the world he was in the world
[37:30] but he was separated from the world
[37:32] and abraham is our example you can't you
[37:35] can't say i'm going to go to a commune
[37:37] and i'm just going
[37:38] you can't live like that you're not
[37:39] supposed to live life jesus didn't want
[37:41] his disciples taken out of the world
[37:43] he wanted them kept from the evil
[37:46] so we have to be right in the midst of
[37:48] it but not living like
[37:50] lot going down there mingling with it
[37:52] for some lust
[37:54] but staying separated from it amen and
[37:57] that's the way
[37:58] that abraham lived it says in 1961
[38:01] abraham and his seat after him
[38:03] now as we find out abraham never fully
[38:05] obeyed
[38:06] now that's the way with a lot of us
[38:08] people as soon as we go and make a
[38:09] confession
[38:10] we think well now we've joined church
[38:12] and we're going to be pretty good people
[38:14] we're neighbors it won't hurt the smoke
[38:16] a little or if i just keep my card party
[38:18] going
[38:19] now listen when brother bam says that
[38:20] you can right away just write off what
[38:22] he's saying because i'm not going to
[38:23] smoke or go to a card party
[38:25] but he's speaking to the denominations
[38:28] that had already fallen
[38:30] but why don't you take this and bring it
[38:31] down home
[38:34] brother branham had to he was preaching
[38:36] to a mixed multitude we're not preaching
[38:38] to a mixed multitude this morning we're
[38:39] preaching to believers
[38:40] [Music]
[38:41] so we can dial it in a little tighter
[38:43] than that
[38:46] if i just keep my car for you that won't
[38:47] hurt anything but remember god never did
[38:50] bless abraham until he fully obeyed
[38:52] and god will not bless the seed until
[38:54] you fully obeyed
[38:55] separating himself from the things of
[38:57] the world come out from among them and
[38:59] be you separate saith the lord
[39:00] i will receive you touch not their
[39:02] unclean things you abide in me and my
[39:05] word in you
[39:05] ask what you will and it'll be done to
[39:07] you see now you see
[39:09] you've got to come out of the world but
[39:11] what did abraham do
[39:13] oh he had his nephew along lot a church
[39:15] member
[39:16] a lukewarm and his daddy the old man was
[39:18] a fly in the ointment as
[39:20] long as he stuck around and he took some
[39:22] of the things along and that's just the
[39:24] way we try to do
[39:25] we try to pull into the churches into
[39:27] our organization the things of the world
[39:31] amen it wasn't necessarily abraham but
[39:34] it's who abraham
[39:35] associated with he had to separate
[39:38] from all of that and he had to live a
[39:41] separated life
[39:42] and when he finally lived separated god
[39:44] came to him
[39:46] in flesh let's go to second corinthians
[39:52] just keep laying a foundation here and
[39:54] then we'll get into what i really want
[39:56] to get into
[39:58] second corinthians 6 and 14
[40:05] 2nd corinthians 6 and 14
[40:08] be not unequally yoked together with
[40:10] unbelievers for what fellowship hath
[40:12] righteousness with unrighteousness
[40:14] and what communion hath light with
[40:16] darkness
[40:17] and what concord hath christ with belial
[40:19] or what part hath he that believeth with
[40:21] an infidel
[40:22] and what agreement hath the temple of
[40:24] god with idols for you are the temple of
[40:25] the living god
[40:26] and god has said i will dwell in them
[40:28] and walk in them and i will be their god
[40:31] and they shall be my people
[40:32] wherefore come out from among them and
[40:34] be separate sayeth the lord and touch
[40:36] not the unclean thing
[40:37] and i will receive you and be a father
[40:40] unto you and you shall be my sons and
[40:42] daughters
[40:42] saith the lord almighty so
[40:45] what does god want separation what does
[40:49] god want
[40:50] holiness hallelujah
[40:53] that's why the entertainments of the
[40:54] world are not for us
[40:57] they're just not for us uh that
[41:00] it used to be if i could just be honest
[41:04] with you
[41:06] i love you all dearly but
[41:09] we know that years ago under the
[41:12] previous administration we were taken
[41:14] down the wrong road
[41:16] worldliness crept in big time
[41:20] and and god has been dealing with me
[41:23] very specifically
[41:25] that it's not all gone yet
[41:28] they come in crept in
[41:32] and then we we were duped we were led to
[41:34] believe and it's our own fault
[41:36] we had the message we didn't have to
[41:37] accept it
[41:39] but some things become acceptable that
[41:40] should have never been acceptable
[41:44] begin to allow our children to watch
[41:46] disney movies like what's wrong with
[41:47] disney movies
[41:50] the anointing that makes them the
[41:53] artists that
[41:53] the artists that make those things that
[41:56] write it and draw it
[41:57] are mostly homosexuals
[42:01] ungodly don't care a thing about god
[42:05] that's not for us the worldly
[42:08] entertainments are not for us
[42:10] just because it's g doesn't make it good
[42:15] just because there's no swearing no
[42:16] nudity no violence doesn't make it good
[42:19] because there's influences that come in
[42:22] there's
[42:23] themes that are introduced there's
[42:25] concepts that come in
[42:27] that aren't of the word of god they're
[42:29] contrary to the word of god
[42:31] and we think no nudity no violence no
[42:33] swearing no
[42:34] no then it's okay it's not okay if this
[42:37] thing that's coming in and this joke and
[42:39] the thing they're laughing about
[42:40] is contrary to the word of god then it's
[42:43] evil
[42:44] even if it's g
[42:50] that's not for us brother branham said
[42:55] brother ben said that the church of the
[42:57] living god is entertained by the holy
[42:58] ghost
[43:00] and the holy ghost feeds on the word
[43:03] there's the recipe right there
[43:07] so some things came in and i know
[43:10] because some things have been washed out
[43:11] of me
[43:12] year after year one thing after another
[43:14] god will bring to my attention and wash
[43:15] it out of me
[43:16] and wash it on me i've accepted it i
[43:18] shouldn't have accepted it i let it in i
[43:19] shouldn't have let it in
[43:20] i've had to apologize to my children
[43:24] i have to say i shouldn't have let you
[43:25] watch that years ago
[43:27] we shouldn't have had that in our home
[43:28] we've had to get rid of some things
[43:30] we've had
[43:31] we've had to make things right
[43:34] and and i don't think we're done because
[43:36] i don't think we understand
[43:38] just how pervasive that spirit was
[43:42] but god wants a clean church
[43:48] brother brahm said in testimony on the
[43:50] sea in 1964
[43:52] everything shiny remember hollywood
[43:54] glitters with worldliness
[43:55] with the gospel glows in humility
[43:59] there's quite a difference between
[44:00] shining and glowing
[44:02] the gospel glows now look at the glow
[44:05] the gospel glows in humility
[44:07] and meekness and humbleness and power
[44:12] a lot of times we don't put power in
[44:14] with those other words
[44:17] because a lot of times what's considered
[44:18] power anymore is flashy and arrogant and
[44:21] showmanship
[44:22] and this is the power of god but that's
[44:23] not the power of god
[44:25] but the gospel goes on humility and
[44:28] meekness
[44:29] and humbleness and power so if we want
[44:32] power
[44:32] let's first get humility because brother
[44:35] graham said the way up is down
[44:38] humility and meekness and humbleness
[44:42] humility and humbleness are like the
[44:44] same thing
[44:45] so that means it's doubly important
[44:48] humility and meekness and humbleness
[44:51] and power
[44:55] brother i'm saying that modern events
[44:56] may clear by prophecy in 1965.
[44:59] look in the bible you see where that
[45:00] what age we're living in
[45:02] when you see these great things being
[45:04] made manifest when god promised to do it
[45:06] he always does it at the end of each age
[45:08] when the church has come to
[45:10] turning to a to the turning place and
[45:12] it's turned from
[45:13] word back to sin and worldliness
[45:16] worldliness
[45:17] is sin
[45:21] worldliness is the opposite of holiness
[45:24] and worldliness is
[45:25] sin the bible said if you love the world
[45:28] or the things of the world the love of
[45:29] god is not even in you
[45:30] speaking last night i was speaking about
[45:32] the sacrifice that was offered the lamb
[45:34] it was to be seven days representing the
[45:36] seven church ages there was to be no
[45:38] leaven found amongst the people no
[45:39] leaven for seven days
[45:41] that means that there's nothing mixed
[45:43] with it
[45:46] there's nothing mixed with it
[45:51] there's nothing mixed with it it's
[45:52] unleavened constantly and we don't want
[45:55] no creeds leavens and things mixed with
[45:57] us we don't
[45:58] want world mixed with us it's got to be
[46:01] the unleavened bread of god the word of
[46:03] god
[46:04] the unadulterated word of god which man
[46:06] shall live by
[46:07] every word that proceedeth out of the
[46:09] mouth of god
[46:11] so we don't want any world mixed in with
[46:13] us
[46:14] so we have to be able to identify the
[46:16] world
[46:18] man i'd like to read out of first peter
[46:21] there's two scriptures i want to read
[46:23] and then i want to talk to you for a
[46:26] while
[46:28] first peter chapter 3
[46:41] first peter chapter 3 verse 1
[46:45] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[46:47] your own husbands that if any obey not
[46:49] the word they also without the word be
[46:50] won
[46:51] by the conversation of the wives well
[46:53] they behold your chaste conversation
[46:55] coupled with fear
[46:57] whose adorning let it not be the outward
[46:59] adorning of planting of the hair
[47:00] the wearing of gold or putting on of
[47:02] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[47:04] the heart
[47:05] in that which is not corruptable even
[47:07] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[47:09] which is in the sight of god a great
[47:11] price
[47:12] for after this manner in the old times
[47:14] the holy women also who trusted in god
[47:16] adorned themselves
[47:17] being in subjection unto their own
[47:20] husbands
[47:20] even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him
[47:23] lord whose daughters you are as long as
[47:25] you do well
[47:26] and are not afraid with any amazement
[47:29] now when i want to look at this when i
[47:33] look at this scripture
[47:35] this is talking about women but it's
[47:36] also talking about the bride
[47:38] you run the parallels together and you
[47:41] look at verse 4 he says
[47:42] but let it be the hidden man of the
[47:44] heart
[47:46] not the outside but let it be the hidden
[47:48] man of the heart and that which is not
[47:50] corruptable
[47:51] even an ornament of a meek and quiet
[47:53] spirit
[47:54] this word meek means mildness of
[47:57] dispensation
[47:58] gentleness of spirit meekness
[48:01] then you get to the word quiet quiet
[48:03] spirit means quiet and tranquil
[48:06] and then we go to the word when it says
[48:08] which is inside of god
[48:10] of great price that word great price
[48:12] means very precious
[48:16] very costly excellent of surpassing
[48:19] value
[48:21] this is what god deems valuable
[48:24] this is what is of great value to god
[48:28] this is what is precious to him so when
[48:31] you look at this
[48:32] if i want to be pleasing to god i need
[48:35] to find out what's pleasing to god
[48:37] and here he's telling us what's pleasing
[48:39] to him
[48:41] he said you know not he said not the
[48:44] outward adorning of planting the hair of
[48:45] wearing gold or putting on apparel but
[48:47] let it be the hidden man of the heart
[48:49] and which is not corruptable even the
[48:51] ornament of a meek
[48:53] mildness meekness gentleness of spirit
[48:57] a meek and quiet quiet tranquil spirit
[48:59] which is in the sight of
[49:00] god of great price
[49:04] that's the opposite of the modern
[49:06] laodicean woman
[49:10] she's bold she's loud she's equal to men
[49:14] she's bosses she's an authority she i
[49:17] mean
[49:18] you just go to the store and you listen
[49:20] to the women screaming all the time
[49:21] loud and boisterous that's not what god
[49:24] wants
[49:26] that's not what he's looking for because
[49:28] the women represent
[49:30] what the condition of the church
[49:33] loud and bossy and the worldly churches
[49:35] are bossing god around
[49:38] loud and proud and all of those things
[49:42] let's go to first timothy chapter 2.
[49:53] first timothy chapter 2
[49:57] in verse nine
[50:04] in like manner also that women adorn
[50:06] themselves in modest apparel
[50:08] with shame faden shamefaceness and
[50:11] sobriety
[50:12] not with broided hair or gold or pearls
[50:14] or costly array
[50:16] but which becometh women professing
[50:18] godliness with good works
[50:20] so saying the same thing peter's saying
[50:23] the same thing paul saying to timothy
[50:26] and this is the area i want to spend
[50:27] some time on because this is what god is
[50:29] drawing my attention to
[50:30] and i'll tell you how he drew my
[50:32] attention to it he did it in a unique
[50:33] way
[50:34] i i just have to tell you a personal
[50:36] story because this is how god deals with
[50:38] me
[50:39] when several years ago i don't know how
[50:41] many years ago maybe
[50:43] six seven eight i don't know five years
[50:46] ago i don't know how long it was
[50:47] probably seven eight nine years ago
[50:49] something like that
[50:50] i went to the philippines and when i was
[50:52] in the philippines i found
[50:54] i wanted to bring something back from my
[50:55] wife so i found a little necklace for my
[50:57] wife
[50:58] and it was a little string of freshwater
[51:01] pearls
[51:02] little white ones modest and small and
[51:04] not very expensive and i
[51:06] brought it back and i gave it to her and
[51:09] thought nothing else of it she
[51:10] liked it she enjoyed it she appreciated
[51:12] that i thought of her
[51:14] and and just went on no problem
[51:18] but several months ago maybe
[51:22] six seven eight months ago i don't know
[51:23] exactly i'm not good with time but some
[51:25] time ago
[51:26] all of a sudden god started drawing my
[51:28] attention to that
[51:30] and i started wondering if that was
[51:31] exactly right
[51:34] and something strange happened she told
[51:37] me she said
[51:38] hey i went to put that necklace on and
[51:40] it broke the hass broke off of it can
[51:42] you fix it for me
[51:43] and i said sure no problem i'll fix it
[51:45] for you and a couple weeks went by and i
[51:48] didn't get to it and
[51:49] one day i went over and i saw the thing
[51:51] laying there
[51:52] on the on the dresser and i said i'll
[51:56] fix that for her
[51:57] and she won't have to remind me she'll
[51:58] be so pleased you know i'm going to get
[52:00] lots of points for this
[52:03] and so i was excited and i picked it up
[52:05] and as soon as i picked it up god spoke
[52:07] in my heart and said
[52:08] don't fix it don't fix it
[52:12] and i put it down and i just started
[52:15] meditating and praying
[52:17] and god showed me that that's not the
[52:20] word
[52:22] because the word says don't wear pearls
[52:27] i had made excuses because we were
[52:29] taught to
[52:32] had used reasoning because we were
[52:33] taught to we were taught in this
[52:35] assembly
[52:36] to let those things go we were taught
[52:40] to do wrong and it was wrong
[52:43] and when god thundered in my heart don't
[52:45] fix it i knew it was wrong
[52:47] and i laid it down and i waited a few
[52:50] days and
[52:51] i explained to angie what the lord had
[52:52] told me and she had no problem you know
[52:55] she had never i had never felt bad about
[52:57] it she had never felt bad about it i saw
[52:59] her i never felt like it was a modest i
[53:00] never had a problem with it
[53:02] then all of a sudden i had a problem
[53:04] with it and
[53:05] and god drew my attention to it and so i
[53:09] i we dealt with it she was fine it was
[53:12] no problem
[53:13] and then when i was in indonesia one
[53:15] time and i brought back a little
[53:16] bracelet a little polished stone
[53:19] bracelet and a week or two after this
[53:21] happened she came out
[53:23] and she said is this okay and god right
[53:25] in my heart said no
[53:27] immediately and i said no sweetheart
[53:29] it's not okay
[53:31] she goes really i said really and so she
[53:32] took it off no questions
[53:34] no arguments and then i explained to her
[53:36] what god had done and she realized there
[53:38] was no problem with it after that
[53:41] and and i thought well that was for our
[53:43] family
[53:44] that's no problem like god's
[53:45] straightening us up praise the lord
[53:48] this is for us but that's not the case
[53:52] this is for the church i was in prayer
[53:56] saturday morning and and since that time
[53:59] over the last several months god's been
[54:00] drawing my attention to things i've been
[54:02] noticing things i've never noticed
[54:03] before
[54:04] i've been looking around and seeing
[54:06] things and god's drawing my attention to
[54:07] certain things
[54:08] and not that i want to have my attention
[54:10] to draw anything i don't
[54:12] but god is and i've just been putting
[54:14] aside and brushing it aside and brushing
[54:16] it aside and
[54:17] saturday morning i kneeled down in
[54:19] prayer and i had other things i wanted
[54:20] to preach on today
[54:22] fun things exciting things
[54:27] but god started doing i went into prayer
[54:29] and while i was in prayer i got lost in
[54:31] prayer
[54:32] and i quit praying and i went into
[54:33] meditation
[54:35] and where i wasn't praying all of a
[54:37] sudden god starts downloading
[54:38] one thing after another after another
[54:40] after another after another
[54:43] and i knew i had to come and deal with
[54:46] this
[54:47] because god told me to because it's mine
[54:50] to do
[54:52] because there's a shepherd over the
[54:53] flock and god drew my attention to it
[54:55] and it's time and i'm so thankful that
[54:58] god doesn't dump everything on us at
[54:59] once
[55:00] but god's let us out bit by bit one
[55:03] thing
[55:04] correct it right next thing correct it
[55:07] get it right the next thing correct it
[55:09] and get it right
[55:10] i'm so thankful god's been tender with
[55:12] us and he's led us along gently
[55:15] but but saturday morning when i got up
[55:17] it was like 45 minutes or an hour of god
[55:19] just dumping this on me
[55:21] planting it right deep in my heart and i
[55:23] knew exactly what it was
[55:25] and and i said god i don't want to
[55:28] preach that
[55:30] i wish i could just be a teacher you
[55:32] know let's just break the seals let's
[55:33] just break something open
[55:35] and i'll let somebody else pastor and
[55:36] i'll come back with the next exciting
[55:38] breaking of the word
[55:39] but that's not what god called me to do
[55:42] and so i was thinking you know about the
[55:45] assembly here and what we've been
[55:46] through and
[55:47] how god's been good to us and what a
[55:48] mature mature assembly it is
[55:51] and i was thinking if i've had to do
[55:53] this many times with my children talk to
[55:55] them about something a change in
[55:56] direction or something that i'm no
[55:58] longer comfortable with
[55:59] and i've got adult children they're
[56:01] mature now and i've got a couple of
[56:03] adult children and i don't force them to
[56:05] do anything
[56:06] i don't hammer them i don't pound on
[56:09] them they're mature
[56:10] and so i give them my vision i tell them
[56:13] what i see
[56:14] and i let them make their choice because
[56:17] if i make the choice for them
[56:19] they don't get the victory if they make
[56:21] the choice they get the victory
[56:23] so with my adult children all i do is
[56:25] share with them what i see
[56:26] i give them wisdom i give them advice i
[56:28] give them what the lord's given me
[56:30] and i let my children make the decision
[56:32] now of course there's a limit to that as
[56:34] well
[56:35] but in those things because i want them
[56:37] to choose i want them to have the
[56:38] victory
[56:39] and if you'll allow me to this morning
[56:41] let's just pretend we're sitting in the
[56:42] living room
[56:44] we're all gathered around sitting in the
[56:46] living room and let me be like a dad
[56:49] and just tell you what i see and tell
[56:51] you what the lord showed me
[56:53] and tell you why
[56:57] when when you know when i gave that to
[57:01] my wife
[57:03] i i didn't think anything of it i
[57:04] thought it was nice she thought it was
[57:06] nice we were happy about it
[57:07] but later when god brought my attention
[57:09] to it
[57:10] i realized that i had been duped
[57:14] that i had come to accept things that i
[57:16] shouldn't have accepted
[57:18] and i went to this quote i'm gonna go
[57:20] ahead and read this quote because every
[57:21] every one of you are already thinking
[57:23] about this quote
[57:24] but i want to look at this quote
[57:25] carefully and see what the prophet's
[57:27] actually saying
[57:28] not what it's been turned into
[57:32] questions and answers 1964 question
[57:34] number 283
[57:36] paragraph 64. brother branham
[57:40] should a christian woman wear simple
[57:42] jewelry or necklace or pearls
[57:44] well sister i know this means a lot to
[57:46] you and it means a lot for me
[57:48] for you to place your confidence i tell
[57:50] you the truth now remember
[57:51] the bible said when you adorn do not
[57:54] adorn with costly jewels and pearls and
[57:55] all kinds of jewelry
[57:57] wearing of jewelry but let that be the
[57:58] adorning of peace and quiet and meek
[58:00] spirit
[58:01] which i just quoted which is a great
[58:03] price before the lord
[58:05] now i don't mean by that sister that if
[58:07] you have a pen
[58:08] now this is me not the lord now pay
[58:11] attention
[58:12] brother man said this is me not the lord
[58:15] so take it for that this is me not the
[58:17] lord i get great value in what the
[58:19] prophet of god says
[58:20] he said this is me not the lord said
[58:23] he says if you had a pen that you wanted
[58:26] to wear or a little necklace your
[58:28] husband gave you
[58:31] if you catch it a pen you want to wear
[58:34] or a little necklace your husband
[58:36] gave you
[58:43] wanted to wear a little necklace or or
[58:45] you know wear
[58:46] a pin a pen that you wanted to wear a
[58:48] little necklace that your husband
[58:50] gave you or maybe something like that
[58:52] you wore now to me i don't think that's
[58:54] bad
[58:55] that's just me now remember i make
[58:57] myself clear
[58:58] that's my opinion but i think it's the
[59:00] approach to it it's the way you do it
[59:02] see
[59:03] it's the motive behind it and when you
[59:05] see it's getting a hold of you then
[59:06] leave the thing alone
[59:07] but i think if you wore your wedding
[59:09] ring now i know you nazarene people
[59:11] it used to be that you wouldn't even
[59:13] baptize a woman with a wedding ring on
[59:15] i don't believe that is necessary in the
[59:16] bible they wore redding rings only it
[59:18] was a tablet they called it around their
[59:19] head
[59:20] nine pieces of coin in it but to show
[59:22] that they were married
[59:23] now i think that's all right if women
[59:26] want to dress and make themselves look
[59:27] decent and clean and ladylike
[59:29] well i think there's not a thing to that
[59:31] to me but when you get to going
[59:33] to put that thing into making it a
[59:35] little pride then you're wrong
[59:37] it's your attitude so
[59:40] that was the quote and i think about the
[59:43] only one you'll find
[59:45] that brought justification to some of
[59:47] our actions
[59:49] but brother branham is very clear this
[59:51] is my opinion
[59:52] this is what i think and just be clear
[59:55] it's my opinion not just me
[59:56] but what he said is if you had a pen
[59:58] that you like to wear
[1:00:00] or a little necklace your husband bought
[1:00:02] you
[1:00:04] that's not an accessory necklace for
[1:00:06] every outfit
[1:00:09] you see what i'm saying but we took one
[1:00:12] thing
[1:00:12] and went further we took
[1:00:16] something and went further and we were
[1:00:17] taught what's your motive behind it
[1:00:20] it's what you're doing but i'd like to
[1:00:23] refer you back to the scriptures
[1:00:25] because we have to stand on the
[1:00:28] scriptures
[1:00:30] so let's look at timothy again
[1:00:33] first timothy 2 9-10 i just want to
[1:00:37] share with you if you're
[1:00:38] ever confused about anything go to the
[1:00:40] scriptures
[1:00:46] first timothy 2 9 and like manner also
[1:00:48] that women adorn themselves in modest
[1:00:50] apparel with shame faceness and sobriety
[1:00:53] not with broader hair or gold or pearls
[1:00:55] or costly array
[1:00:56] but which becomes which becometh women
[1:00:59] professing godliness
[1:01:00] with good works that's the scriptures
[1:01:05] that's the scriptures that's not
[1:01:06] somebody's opinion that's the scriptures
[1:01:10] now if you can go with me back to first
[1:01:12] peter 3.
[1:01:17] see friends i realized when i read that
[1:01:20] again
[1:01:21] that i had actually left the scriptures
[1:01:25] that the scriptures actually mentioned
[1:01:27] pearls
[1:01:28] and that's what i bought and i was duped
[1:01:30] into leaving the scripture because of
[1:01:32] this quote
[1:01:33] not that brother venom quoted it wrong
[1:01:35] but that it was re-quoted and
[1:01:36] re-emphasized wrong
[1:01:43] first peter 3
[1:01:47] one likewise you wise be in subjection
[1:01:49] to your own husbands that if any obey
[1:01:51] not the word they
[1:01:52] also may without the word be won by the
[1:01:54] conversation of the wise while they
[1:01:55] behold your chaste conversation coupled
[1:01:57] with fear
[1:01:58] whose adorning let it not be the outward
[1:02:00] adorning of planting the hair
[1:02:02] and of wearing of gold or putting on of
[1:02:04] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:02:06] the heart
[1:02:07] and that which is not corruptable even
[1:02:09] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:02:11] which is in the sight of god of great
[1:02:13] price
[1:02:15] so here peter's saying the same thing
[1:02:18] it matters what we wear and jewelry does
[1:02:22] matter it does matter and because we
[1:02:26] because we flexed what the prophet has
[1:02:28] said
[1:02:29] now if i can just go back to what the
[1:02:31] prophet said if you had a pen
[1:02:32] or little necklace that your husband
[1:02:34] bought you or your wedding ring
[1:02:38] now why can't we leave it there
[1:02:41] see but but we went more than the
[1:02:43] wedding ring
[1:02:44] we went more than the little necklace
[1:02:46] that our husband bought us
[1:02:48] and when brother graham said the little
[1:02:49] necklace that your husband bought you
[1:02:52] to me this is just me now
[1:02:55] that's something special that's not
[1:02:59] that's not an accessory for every
[1:03:01] garment that's not
[1:03:02] just for the case of adorning but
[1:03:04] there's something special for some
[1:03:06] special reason
[1:03:07] something that your husband bought you
[1:03:09] and even in that
[1:03:11] brother brenham said this is just my
[1:03:12] opinion this is just me so
[1:03:16] even in that he says it's just me but
[1:03:18] what he said
[1:03:20] what he said was a pen or a little
[1:03:23] necklace
[1:03:23] little necklace your husband bought you
[1:03:27] which means it's something special a
[1:03:29] gift for a reason
[1:03:31] or your wedding band he didn't say any
[1:03:34] more than that
[1:03:36] but somehow we took that
[1:03:39] and when the when we let the bars down
[1:03:42] more flooded in more than what the
[1:03:45] prophet said
[1:03:46] but we use this scripture for justice
[1:03:48] this quote for justification
[1:03:49] and that that quote is not justification
[1:03:52] for everything that we see now
[1:03:54] we went further than what we should have
[1:03:56] went and we certainly went
[1:03:58] further than the scriptures i want to
[1:04:00] come back to the scriptures
[1:04:03] and brother branham he's a good guide
[1:04:05] and he guided us right but
[1:04:06] if we're going to take what he said us
[1:04:08] take just what he said
[1:04:09] not more is that fair
[1:04:12] remember we're sitting around the living
[1:04:14] room you don't have to shout amen you
[1:04:16] don't have that's not going to bother me
[1:04:18] you can sit quiet because we're just in
[1:04:19] the living room i'm just sharing with
[1:04:21] you what the lord shared with me
[1:04:23] and how how he spoke to me
[1:04:27] and i'm just gonna i'm just going to
[1:04:29] drop on you exactly what dropped in my
[1:04:31] heart
[1:04:32] if you'll let me do that and take it
[1:04:33] from the lord and take it from your
[1:04:35] pastor
[1:04:36] somebody's got to be the shepherd
[1:04:37] somebody's got to watch over the flock
[1:04:39] and this isn't of my desire this has
[1:04:42] been impressed upon me by the lord
[1:04:43] and god has called me to this office in
[1:04:46] this place
[1:04:47] and so if you believe that you're a
[1:04:48] sheep in this fold then you better
[1:04:50] listen
[1:04:52] you can do what you want you can make
[1:04:54] your own choice but i'm just giving you
[1:04:56] a good stiff warning
[1:04:58] and i'm giving you a good lesson if you
[1:05:01] believe that you're a sheep in this fold
[1:05:03] god has anointed the shepherd to say a
[1:05:05] certain thing a certain way
[1:05:06] and i'm going to do it exactly the way
[1:05:08] he dropped it in my heart saturday
[1:05:10] morning
[1:05:12] so i would i would listen
[1:05:15] he dropped in phrases that weren't my
[1:05:17] phrases
[1:05:18] analogies that weren't my analogies and
[1:05:20] i and i i just appreciate god for that
[1:05:24] i'd say it like this modesty is not
[1:05:27] determined by the amount of fabric
[1:05:29] or how much skin is covered
[1:05:32] modesty is not determined by the amount
[1:05:35] of fabric
[1:05:36] or how much skin is covered you can have
[1:05:40] skin covered from the neck to the wrist
[1:05:42] to the ankles and it not be modest
[1:05:45] and you can use yards and yards of
[1:05:47] fabric and it not be
[1:05:48] modest because modesty
[1:05:51] is a spiritual condition
[1:05:55] an immodesty is a display of an
[1:05:58] influencing spirit
[1:06:00] this is what god showed me in modesty
[1:06:04] is actually when something's done in an
[1:06:06] unmodest way
[1:06:07] it doesn't mean that you're
[1:06:08] demon-possessed it doesn't mean you're
[1:06:10] not a child of god
[1:06:11] it just means there's an influence
[1:06:13] coming in and the end
[1:06:15] the spiritual influence can be seen in
[1:06:17] the in modesty
[1:06:19] it's spiritual it's not natural it's a
[1:06:22] natural reflection of a spiritual
[1:06:24] condition
[1:06:26] and so these things have to be taught so
[1:06:28] that we understand what's happening so
[1:06:30] we know how to pray and we know what
[1:06:31] we're looking for
[1:06:32] and we're watchful all the time now
[1:06:35] when when i when i in my failure to keep
[1:06:39] the scriptures
[1:06:40] bought that necklace for my wife i was
[1:06:42] no less a son of god
[1:06:44] it didn't diminish my sonship by any
[1:06:46] degrees
[1:06:48] all right and in fact god was merciful
[1:06:51] to me because he understood it was wrong
[1:06:53] teaching
[1:06:55] so god had a lot of mercy on me for a
[1:06:56] long time i mean when he brought it to
[1:06:58] my attention i had regrets
[1:07:00] i repented i understood where my failure
[1:07:02] was but god had a lot of mercy on me he
[1:07:04] didn't bring the hammer down
[1:07:05] he was merciful and he showed me and he
[1:07:07] began to reveal to me
[1:07:09] and that's what god's doing this morning
[1:07:12] showing mercy
[1:07:14] when when my wife accepted the gift and
[1:07:15] when she wore it she was no less a
[1:07:18] daughter of god
[1:07:19] god didn't stop answering our prayers he
[1:07:21] didn't stop healing us
[1:07:23] he didn't he didn't stop moving in our
[1:07:25] home he didn't stop growing a spiritual
[1:07:26] he didn't stop any of that
[1:07:28] because much of what we were doing we
[1:07:29] should have known better but a lot of it
[1:07:31] was in ignorance and a lot of it was
[1:07:32] because of false teaching and wrong
[1:07:34] influences
[1:07:35] so god was merciful to us but now he's
[1:07:37] asking for a greater maturity and he's
[1:07:39] saying no more
[1:07:41] now it's time to stop and i thought well
[1:07:43] that's like i said it's for my family
[1:07:45] but after saturday morning
[1:07:46] i realized it wasn't just for my family
[1:07:49] god allowed that scenario to play out in
[1:07:51] my family just so i would tune in and
[1:07:53] focus on something
[1:07:54] amen because because it's a it's a
[1:07:56] physical type of
[1:07:57] something spiritual because brother ben
[1:07:59] said the husband is
[1:08:01] the the pastor is the spiritual husband
[1:08:02] of the church
[1:08:04] and so after saturday morning i realized
[1:08:06] what i have to do
[1:08:08] and why i have to do it praise god
[1:08:16] let's read another quote and then i'll
[1:08:18] get into some more
[1:08:21] questions and answers 1964.
[1:08:26] you know in every life there is a male
[1:08:28] as the prettiest but the human race
[1:08:30] take any bird cow take a bunch of cattle
[1:08:32] which is the prettiest the old crumpled
[1:08:33] horned cow or the big bull
[1:08:35] take a deer which is the little doe or
[1:08:37] the buck take a bunch of elk which is
[1:08:39] the prettiest the male or female
[1:08:41] moose whatever you want to do take take
[1:08:43] it in the bird take it in the chicken
[1:08:45] the rooster the hen
[1:08:47] take it in the bird the little pretty
[1:08:48] cardinal or the little speckled hen
[1:08:50] set on her nest and raise her eggs see
[1:08:52] everything in the whole race
[1:08:54] always the male is the prettiest but the
[1:08:55] female to the human
[1:08:57] why she she calls the fall satan chose
[1:09:00] her right there and beauty is of the
[1:09:02] devil see
[1:09:03] satan was the most beautiful angel he
[1:09:05] was a cherubim that overshadowed
[1:09:07] look how different women is getting now
[1:09:09] to what they used to be
[1:09:11] how many remembers reading of pearl
[1:09:13] brian let's see your hands some of you
[1:09:15] older people supposed to be the most
[1:09:16] beautiful woman in america
[1:09:18] any little teenage sniper fritz on the
[1:09:20] street would be twice as pretty as she
[1:09:22] now why that's just exactly what the
[1:09:25] bible said
[1:09:25] when the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:09:27] of men were fair that was the bunch of
[1:09:29] renegades that sent the flood upon the
[1:09:31] earth
[1:09:31] that god destroyed the whole human race
[1:09:33] see and brother bam showing
[1:09:36] that the the the the women are becoming
[1:09:39] more fair more attractive and prettier
[1:09:42] as time goes on
[1:09:43] and he goes back to show pearl brian as
[1:09:46] the example she was supposed to be
[1:09:48] prettiest woman in the world
[1:09:49] and nobody would even turn their head to
[1:09:50] look at her now
[1:09:52] because beauty is increasing because
[1:09:54] it's coming back to what it was in the
[1:09:56] days of noah
[1:09:57] it's got to come back to that condition
[1:09:59] amen and that condition is causing the
[1:10:01] fall
[1:10:02] of mankind it's causing everything that
[1:10:04] it calls the first times causing it
[1:10:05] again
[1:10:07] so that's what brother benham is
[1:10:08] explaining
[1:10:11] it's exactly and today everything's
[1:10:12] based on upon hollywood and
[1:10:14] beauty and things like that when beauty
[1:10:16] is the secret thing of the heart
[1:10:18] and not the outward appearance
[1:10:21] praise god beauty is the secret thing in
[1:10:25] the heart and not the outward appearance
[1:10:27] and i think i have failed on this my
[1:10:30] wife and i have failed in this
[1:10:32] but i want to share this with you so
[1:10:33] that we're not continually failing
[1:10:36] if we take our little girls and over
[1:10:38] emphasize
[1:10:39] physical attractiveness to our little
[1:10:41] tiny thoughts
[1:10:42] we're going to sow into them the wrong
[1:10:44] desire for the wrong thing
[1:10:47] they already have a little human spirit
[1:10:49] they already want to be accepted they
[1:10:51] want to be pretty they want to be all
[1:10:53] those things
[1:10:54] but when we take and make that a focal
[1:10:56] point we're always talking about how
[1:10:57] pretty they are
[1:10:58] and if we buy them little dress up
[1:11:00] clothes with little high heels and
[1:11:02] necklaces and rings
[1:11:06] now i can say that because i did it
[1:11:10] so that gives me the right to say it and
[1:11:13] i've been chastised for it so now i can
[1:11:15] really say it
[1:11:16] i did it and i got my spanking so now i
[1:11:18] can say it but we've got to be more
[1:11:21] spiritually aware than we've been in the
[1:11:22] past
[1:11:23] we can't be as duped as we were
[1:11:25] everything we do matters we're setting
[1:11:27] an example
[1:11:28] we're putting those children on a course
[1:11:30] and everything we do is setting them on
[1:11:31] a course
[1:11:32] and we've got to be careful what
[1:11:34] influences we as parents put into their
[1:11:36] lives
[1:11:37] or allowance of their lives and we buy
[1:11:39] them the little princess dress up
[1:11:40] outfits with the sparkly high heels
[1:11:42] the big greens the ruby necklaces and
[1:11:45] all of these things
[1:11:46] what are you telling that girl and then
[1:11:47] you go oh and all you're so beautiful
[1:11:49] you're the princess you're the queen
[1:11:50] someday prince charming will come
[1:11:56] see we all have different personality
[1:11:58] types and we all have
[1:12:00] different propensities to different
[1:12:01] things
[1:12:04] and some are more susceptible to things
[1:12:06] than others
[1:12:08] and you can start things there that will
[1:12:11] carry on for years
[1:12:15] what does the bible say the adorning of
[1:12:18] a meek and quiet spirit
[1:12:22] many of us have told our daughters your
[1:12:24] character is shining today
[1:12:28] your inward beauty is stunning to me
[1:12:32] see we got we got caught up in laodicea
[1:12:36] and we felt like you know you've got to
[1:12:40] lavish
[1:12:40] praise on your girls and tell them
[1:12:42] they're beautiful because they won't
[1:12:42] feel like they are and you've got to
[1:12:44] make them feel like they are
[1:12:45] amen it doesn't matter if they're
[1:12:48] completely
[1:12:48] unattractive but if they have the right
[1:12:52] spirit
[1:12:53] to god that's a precious thing
[1:12:57] and we've been focused on the wrong
[1:12:59] thing and training in the wrong area and
[1:13:01] going the wrong direction
[1:13:03] for years because those things are not
[1:13:05] in the word
[1:13:06] that's not the scripture that's not our
[1:13:08] focus that's not our emphasis that's not
[1:13:10] the message
[1:13:12] but because it was at the walmart shelf
[1:13:15] we bought it without any spiritual
[1:13:18] discernment
[1:13:19] we bought it and some of us made worse
[1:13:23] mistakes than that and this one's not
[1:13:24] mine but i want to tell it anyways
[1:13:26] they bought little makeup kits that was
[1:13:29] play makeup kits
[1:13:31] and little hairdo kits and
[1:13:35] what are we telling our little girls
[1:13:37] what's important and what matters
[1:13:42] see we're just around the living room i
[1:13:44] don't like these conversations
[1:13:46] but they're good they're needful
[1:13:50] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:13:52] have been released in ecclesiastical
[1:13:54] realms to do what
[1:13:55] to disrupt the forward progress of the
[1:13:57] bride
[1:13:58] to try to handicap the bride because the
[1:14:00] maturity of this bride is bringing the
[1:14:02] demise of satan's eden
[1:14:04] and you think he's just going to come
[1:14:05] one way he's going to come many
[1:14:07] different ways
[1:14:09] he's going to start when you're young
[1:14:10] come when you're old come through your
[1:14:12] friend
[1:14:12] come through a neighbor come through a
[1:14:14] family member
[1:14:16] we've got to be careful and just because
[1:14:19] brother xyz and sister xyz bought their
[1:14:22] child this thing doesn't mean it's good
[1:14:24] for your child
[1:14:26] and just because your little girl a
[1:14:27] little boy comes home from sunday school
[1:14:29] class and says
[1:14:30] hey everybody in class has got this or
[1:14:32] done this why can't i
[1:14:34] we had to deal with that his son come
[1:14:37] home from sunday school class little
[1:14:38] bitty sunday school class
[1:14:40] crying everybody in class is talking
[1:14:42] about spiderman i'm the only one who
[1:14:43] doesn't know anything about it
[1:14:45] crying tears coming down his face
[1:14:48] something was bad wrong
[1:14:52] bad wrong and we're still
[1:14:55] being washed out of that so don't think
[1:14:58] it's all gone we're still
[1:15:00] being washed out of that friends i'm
[1:15:01] still being washed out of that
[1:15:06] and so those things are not all right
[1:15:09] it's not just kitty it's not just
[1:15:11] trivial
[1:15:12] these things matter we've got to have
[1:15:14] some spiritual discernment and
[1:15:16] look at something before we jump into it
[1:15:18] and look at something before we do it
[1:15:19] and say
[1:15:20] is this what god wants
[1:15:23] i said before we can't always go with
[1:15:25] the assumption because it was okay in
[1:15:27] the past it's okay now
[1:15:28] that's not always the case but we've got
[1:15:31] to say god
[1:15:32] and and i made this statement for and i
[1:15:35] hope you can take it
[1:15:36] i hope you i hope all of you can take it
[1:15:39] home
[1:15:40] when we ask the question well what's
[1:15:42] wrong with it we've asked the wrong
[1:15:43] question
[1:15:48] the question should be what does he want
[1:15:50] me to do
[1:15:52] what does god want me to do today now in
[1:15:55] this situation
[1:15:56] but when you ask the question well
[1:15:57] what's wrong with it immediately
[1:16:00] there's a wrong spirit attached to that
[1:16:07] amen god is good i'm gonna finish this
[1:16:10] quote
[1:16:13] beauty is the secret thing of the heart
[1:16:14] and not the outward appearance
[1:16:16] let them adorn themselves not with
[1:16:18] outward appearance but inward of meek
[1:16:20] gentle spirit
[1:16:21] that's a christian so now on your
[1:16:23] question sister i don't know just what
[1:16:24] to tell you she was asking if it was all
[1:16:26] right for her to be a hairdresser
[1:16:28] now i can stop right now or take another
[1:16:30] 30 minutes and
[1:16:31] and how many would just stay another 30
[1:16:33] minutes he's asking if he can ask
[1:16:34] another question
[1:16:35] so now he takes another question said
[1:16:37] brother branham does this first timothy
[1:16:38] 2 9 mean women
[1:16:40] can't braid her hair does broad hair
[1:16:42] mean braided hair
[1:16:44] he says now look sister now i'm glad
[1:16:47] that followed this
[1:16:48] what i just read to you i'm glad that
[1:16:50] followed this
[1:16:52] i never fixed it there but just it
[1:16:53] followed that good
[1:16:55] notice a braided hair in that day was a
[1:16:57] sign of a street woman
[1:16:58] that's what she done braided her hair
[1:17:00] paul said to the
[1:17:01] christians now that adorning not not let
[1:17:04] it be of
[1:17:05] braided or boarded or braided is the
[1:17:07] same thing to braid their hair because
[1:17:09] it
[1:17:09] looked like the rest of the world now
[1:17:11] you're supposed
[1:17:12] not to look like the world or act like
[1:17:15] the world
[1:17:17] what's he talking about hair
[1:17:21] is he talking about braided hair aborted
[1:17:23] hair he's talking about hair
[1:17:25] let the lesson come home you're not
[1:17:28] supposed to look like the world or act
[1:17:30] like the world
[1:17:32] see the women are supposed to be
[1:17:34] different there see now
[1:17:35] braided hair now today braided hair is
[1:17:37] pretty and it's a long ways from the
[1:17:39] fashion of the world
[1:17:40] now you see the women the way they do
[1:17:42] their hair just keep your hair in a way
[1:17:44] just don't look like the world
[1:17:47] don't look or dress like it if they wear
[1:17:49] shorts you wear a dress
[1:17:51] if they do their hair cut off and all
[1:17:52] bobbed and do that you just let yours
[1:17:54] alone see
[1:17:55] and the braid now the question is
[1:17:58] braided me embroidered mean braided yes
[1:17:59] that's right
[1:18:00] and now on the street now look i look
[1:18:02] now i looked that up
[1:18:05] out i find out years ago what the
[1:18:07] braided hair meant
[1:18:08] see the women actually the women of old
[1:18:10] just just pulled their hair back and
[1:18:12] tied it more like a ponytail today and
[1:18:14] they went around they had robes on like
[1:18:16] that but the women of the street took
[1:18:17] their hair and braided it all across
[1:18:19] their heads
[1:18:20] and wrapped it around like that and put
[1:18:21] flowers in it and things like that
[1:18:23] and that was the flapper on the street
[1:18:25] just like we see the flapper today
[1:18:27] the way she dresses so
[1:18:31] brother branham was saying it wasn't
[1:18:33] just a straight braid down the back
[1:18:35] they braided their hair and wrapped it
[1:18:37] over i don't know how
[1:18:39] wrapped it over the head and put flowers
[1:18:40] in it and things like that
[1:18:44] he says don't look like the world
[1:18:49] if a hairstyle becomes popular in the
[1:18:52] world
[1:18:52] don't do it
[1:18:56] that's what he's telling us don't look
[1:18:58] like the world
[1:18:59] just because hair is uncut doesn't mean
[1:19:02] it's always holy
[1:19:04] because we can do unholy things with
[1:19:07] uncut hair
[1:19:12] praise god
[1:19:16] see what happens is influences come in
[1:19:21] and they're like i said there's
[1:19:22] different people with different
[1:19:23] propensities and different natures and
[1:19:25] different makeups and different
[1:19:26] weaknesses
[1:19:29] you may take a sister that's got a
[1:19:31] weakness for this area for fashion and
[1:19:33] things like that and it's a weakness
[1:19:35] it's something she has to fight against
[1:19:37] and she might spend her time on the
[1:19:39] internet looking up cute hairstyles
[1:19:41] i wouldn't waste my time we're not
[1:19:44] supposed to look like the world
[1:19:47] she finds some little new hoochie-doo
[1:19:49] thing
[1:19:52] i'm going to say it that way because
[1:19:53] sometimes it's ridiculous what i see
[1:19:56] in message churches and even in this
[1:19:58] church
[1:20:00] coming with their air all twisted up and
[1:20:01] stuck right on the side of their head
[1:20:04] that's not simple that's not holy
[1:20:07] because that come
[1:20:08] right out of the world right it was a
[1:20:11] worldly hairstyle
[1:20:12] somebody picked it up in the church
[1:20:14] tried it when somebody saw it
[1:20:16] they heard all the other girls to gather
[1:20:17] around that girl and say oh that's so
[1:20:19] cute how did you do it and the next
[1:20:20] sunday two more got it and the next
[1:20:21] sunday five more got it and the next
[1:20:23] thing you know everybody looks
[1:20:24] ridiculous sitting out here with their
[1:20:26] hair all wadded up and stuck on the side
[1:20:28] of their head
[1:20:31] how did that happen it slipped in
[1:20:33] through one
[1:20:34] and because they were a believer now
[1:20:36] it's okay
[1:20:38] you see what happens see how the devil
[1:20:40] comes in because i know that they
[1:20:42] are a real believer i know they live a
[1:20:44] godly life i know they love the lord
[1:20:46] i know they have a good family and if
[1:20:48] they do it it must be
[1:20:50] okay and you don't know that's a
[1:20:53] struggle for that sister that brother
[1:20:55] that's a weakness that they have to
[1:20:56] fight all the time
[1:20:57] and now you picked up their weakness and
[1:21:00] carried it through the church
[1:21:02] because it goes from one to the other to
[1:21:04] the other
[1:21:05] to the other
[1:21:10] i thought before the next time i see
[1:21:11] some fad pass through the church
[1:21:13] i'm just going to gather everybody up
[1:21:14] who's caught it that sunday and line
[1:21:16] them up front
[1:21:17] and say look how silly we look look how
[1:21:20] ridiculous we look
[1:21:21] we're all copying one another trying to
[1:21:23] stay in the latest fashion and the
[1:21:24] latest trend
[1:21:25] and the latest hairstyle and the latest
[1:21:30] see what i mean this hits home but it
[1:21:32] hits home i mean
[1:21:33] the reason it hits home is because it
[1:21:34] hits home because we've all done it i've
[1:21:36] done it you've done it
[1:21:38] people around us have done it but we
[1:21:41] don't want to
[1:21:42] catch the wrong influence we want to
[1:21:43] have spiritual discernment
[1:21:45] and say is this god is this the holy
[1:21:48] ghost
[1:21:48] is this right for me to do today not
[1:21:51] because sister so-and-so and brother
[1:21:53] so-and-so and that good family
[1:21:54] they're good people there's nothing
[1:21:56] wrong with them they
[1:21:59] they if we're not nobody's saying
[1:22:01] somebody is not a son or daughter of god
[1:22:02] doesn't have the holy ghost
[1:22:04] not saying that at all because the
[1:22:05] scripture says grieve not the holy ghost
[1:22:07] thereby
[1:22:07] whereby you are sealed that means you
[1:22:09] can grieve the holy ghost and still have
[1:22:11] the holy ghost
[1:22:12] so you can do something that's grieving
[1:22:14] to the holy ghost even after you have it
[1:22:15] nobody's putting anybody in
[1:22:17] or anybody else but what we're talking
[1:22:18] about is influences
[1:22:20] we've got to be influenced by the word
[1:22:22] of god not the world
[1:22:24] and influenced by sister so-and-so that
[1:22:27] got influenced by the world is the
[1:22:28] influence of the world
[1:22:31] we thought it was sister so-and-so
[1:22:32] brother so and so but we didn't realize
[1:22:34] they picked it up from the world
[1:22:37] and it come down through the line and
[1:22:39] it's a worldly influence we've now
[1:22:41] picked up
[1:22:45] praise to be the god
[1:22:48] i see it all the time with hairstyles so
[1:22:52] one time that people were braiding one
[1:22:53] little strand of braided hair
[1:22:55] down like this just one little teeny
[1:22:58] thin one
[1:22:59] that's weird like whenever you see
[1:23:02] something really weird like that
[1:23:04] it's like why would you do that that's
[1:23:06] weird the next thing you know you go out
[1:23:08] to the mall and there it is she's got it
[1:23:10] and she's got it
[1:23:11] it's a worldly trend that's passing
[1:23:13] through the worldly women
[1:23:15] and somebody picked it up you go to
[1:23:18] youth camp and you see they've got one
[1:23:20] little bitty bit of hair colored a
[1:23:22] different color than all the others
[1:23:24] it's like what why are you doing that
[1:23:28] that's not the holy ghost influence
[1:23:31] is that fair to say we picked that up
[1:23:34] from somebody else somewhere else
[1:23:36] and it didn't come from within the holy
[1:23:39] ghost influence on the church of god
[1:23:40] it came from the world and crept in
[1:23:42] through a crack somewhere
[1:23:44] and once it got in somebody saw a good
[1:23:47] person
[1:23:48] do it and they just repeat it
[1:23:51] we got to be careful with these things
[1:23:54] these
[1:23:54] things matter
[1:23:58] does it matter brother chad it matters
[1:24:00] enough that god
[1:24:02] god absolutely arrested my prayer time
[1:24:05] and shut me down and dumped all of this
[1:24:06] in my heart
[1:24:08] it matters modesty is a spiritual
[1:24:12] condition
[1:24:13] or displaying a lack of it is displaying
[1:24:15] a spiritual
[1:24:17] influence every time i see something i
[1:24:20] ask myself where did that come from
[1:24:22] something really i mean i don't mean
[1:24:24] somebody have their hair back one day
[1:24:26] and down one day that's fine that's no
[1:24:28] problem but all of a sudden it's like
[1:24:31] that's
[1:24:31] weird and you all know what i'm talking
[1:24:35] about
[1:24:36] and it comes straight from the world
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:47] i'll just i'm just going to download to
[1:24:49] you it was downloaded to me
[1:24:53] when it comes to modesty and clothing
[1:24:56] the body should move within the clothing
[1:25:02] your clothing should fit loose enough
[1:25:04] that your body
[1:25:05] can move within your clothing
[1:25:09] it's the nicest way i can word it
[1:25:14] because sometimes clothing is so tight
[1:25:17] that it shows every move of your body
[1:25:20] and clothing was given to hide or cover
[1:25:23] the body
[1:25:24] not to display the form of the body
[1:25:28] that's why god it covered our nakedness
[1:25:31] god is trying to cover the form of the
[1:25:32] body
[1:25:33] and we think modesty is the mount of
[1:25:35] skin showing or not showing
[1:25:37] you like i said you can be covered from
[1:25:38] the neck to the wrist
[1:25:40] to the ankles and be completely immodest
[1:25:44] because if you've got something
[1:25:45] stretched tight over your body
[1:25:47] every time you twist or turn it
[1:25:49] accentuates the movement or form of the
[1:25:51] body
[1:25:52] and this is for men and women
[1:25:56] because men in the last few years
[1:25:58] started wearing these super tight
[1:25:59] sweaters you know
[1:26:00] and especially if a man's been working
[1:26:02] out a little bit and got a little bit of
[1:26:03] muscle he can't wait to get that super
[1:26:05] skin tight
[1:26:06] thing on and these super tight pants and
[1:26:09] all this nonsense
[1:26:11] men's pants should fit around their
[1:26:12] waist not hugging down on their hips
[1:26:16] shouldn't be skin tight you should have
[1:26:18] room to move within your clothes so your
[1:26:20] clothes don't not
[1:26:35] it's available across the shoulders
[1:26:37] tight down through here
[1:26:38] tucks under the breast and tucks down
[1:26:40] the side and every time she moves
[1:26:42] everything's on display and every
[1:26:44] brother in the church has to turn away
[1:26:46] from that sister
[1:26:49] it shouldn't be that way we shouldn't
[1:26:51] have that going on
[1:26:53] we got to have some discernment and
[1:26:54] awareness your body should move within
[1:26:57] your clothes your clothes shouldn't
[1:26:59] show every form of your body as you move
[1:27:04] praise be the god
[1:27:10] so let's go back to the original purpose
[1:27:12] for clothing
[1:27:14] to hide your form to cover your body
[1:27:18] leggings and short skirts are not modest
[1:27:22] there i said it
[1:27:26] leggings and short skirts are not modest
[1:27:29] it doesn't cover the form
[1:27:31] doesn't hide the body but no skin
[1:27:33] showing i'm not worried about skin
[1:27:37] leggings with a short skirt are not
[1:27:39] modest
[1:27:43] skirts that mimic men's pants from the
[1:27:45] thighs upward are not modest
[1:27:48] if they've got pockets in the front
[1:27:50] pockets in the back and a fly
[1:27:52] they are they are mimicking men's pair
[1:27:54] of pants from the thighs up they're the
[1:27:56] same as a men's pair of pants
[1:27:58] they're not feminine and they're not
[1:28:00] modest why does a woman need a fly
[1:28:05] they were created for men that's
[1:28:07] menswear
[1:28:08] women don't need a fly that's pretty
[1:28:11] straight but it's the truth
[1:28:15] so men's swimming skirts that mimic
[1:28:18] men's clothes i mean
[1:28:22] you there's no difference two front
[1:28:24] pockets
[1:28:25] a fly and a button or a zipper and two
[1:28:27] pockets in the back
[1:28:28] there there are men's jeans men's
[1:28:30] britches
[1:28:32] they're not modest straight skirts
[1:28:35] are not modest
[1:28:38] everybody likes to wear these little
[1:28:40] straight ones with no flow and no form
[1:28:43] a little straight and like to wear them
[1:28:45] just
[1:28:47] just just below the knee so we can say
[1:28:51] we're covering the knee
[1:28:52] and be in the message but then every
[1:28:54] time you sit down everybody's turning
[1:28:56] their head like this
[1:28:57] because you're wiggling to keep that
[1:28:59] knee covered
[1:29:02] brother branham didn't tell us these
[1:29:03] things so we could walk the line
[1:29:05] he didn't tell us these things so we
[1:29:06] could get his clothes see when you see
[1:29:08] that there's a spiritual influence there
[1:29:10] something's going on
[1:29:11] there's more than just the skirt there
[1:29:14] that's what we miss so many times if
[1:29:16] we're always wanting to be on the line
[1:29:18] and everything's always on the edge
[1:29:20] something's wrong spiritually there's a
[1:29:22] spiritual growth that needs a place a
[1:29:24] spiritual awakening
[1:29:25] some deliverance something needs to
[1:29:27] happen if everything's always on the
[1:29:28] edge
[1:29:29] it's tight it's all these funny forms of
[1:29:32] these leggings sticking out and these
[1:29:34] little bitty and in these skirts when
[1:29:35] they wear the leggings with the skirt
[1:29:37] usually it's a little bitty thin skirt
[1:29:39] that clings all over the thighs in the
[1:29:41] rear end
[1:29:46] and then women think they can sit any
[1:29:48] way they want to sit because they got
[1:29:49] leggings on
[1:29:51] it doesn't work it doesn't work
[1:29:55] praise god if it requires a slit to walk
[1:30:00] then it's too tight
[1:30:05] it's not brain surgery this is simple if
[1:30:07] it requires a slit and a slit's not
[1:30:09] modest anyways but if it requires a slit
[1:30:11] so you have free form in your legs so
[1:30:13] you can actually take a full step
[1:30:16] then it's too long or it's too tight
[1:30:19] it's showing the
[1:30:20] form underneath it's not covering the
[1:30:22] form
[1:30:28] capped sleeves are not modest
[1:30:31] i said it
[1:30:34] because every time you raise your hand
[1:30:36] somebody's looking underneath
[1:30:40] loose sleeves are not modest for the
[1:30:43] same reason
[1:30:45] a woman has really loose season got a
[1:30:46] big baggy t-shirt on
[1:30:48] every time she fixes her hair every guy
[1:30:50] in the room has to turn his head
[1:30:54] little bitty t-shirts are not modest
[1:30:57] they're not modest they cling too much
[1:31:00] they show the underneath for them too
[1:31:01] much
[1:31:02] they're not modest you should have
[1:31:05] sleeves enough
[1:31:06] to hide what's under your shoulder
[1:31:10] praise be to god capsies are not modest
[1:31:16] little t-shirts are not modest
[1:31:21] hair for men or women
[1:31:25] conveys an attitude
[1:31:30] anybody that's halfway spiritual will
[1:31:32] say amen to that
[1:31:34] this isn't just for women this is for
[1:31:35] men too clothes and hair
[1:31:38] you can see a young man come in he comes
[1:31:39] sauntering in with his tight britches
[1:31:41] hung down on his hips
[1:31:42] skin tight shirt and some poofy fluffy
[1:31:45] thing with
[1:31:46] hot you know with bleach streaks or i
[1:31:48] don't know what they do to it
[1:31:50] i don't know how they get it brown and
[1:31:51] yellow at the same time
[1:31:54] but you see them walk in and you say
[1:31:55] there's something wrong with that boy
[1:32:00] and then you feel condemned i shouldn't
[1:32:01] think that i should think lovely and
[1:32:02] wonderful of everybody
[1:32:03] but that's your spiritual discernment
[1:32:04] telling you there's something not right
[1:32:06] about that
[1:32:07] and we've swallowed that down too long
[1:32:09] and we've played nice he's too long
[1:32:10] instead of being real not hating a
[1:32:12] brother he might need encouragement he
[1:32:14] might need the word
[1:32:15] he might need deliverance he might need
[1:32:17] salvation
[1:32:18] it's not a pull away from somebody but
[1:32:20] also we don't have to shut off our
[1:32:21] spiritual discernment to be nice
[1:32:23] you have to say there's something wrong
[1:32:24] there there's a wrong spirit influencing
[1:32:26] right there
[1:32:28] and then you go to them with
[1:32:30] understanding you can be nice you can
[1:32:32] you can be helpful you can be
[1:32:33] encouraging but but you have to not
[1:32:36] shut off your spiritual discernment say
[1:32:37] no everything's fine not no everything's
[1:32:39] not fine
[1:32:41] the woman who comes in with a little
[1:32:43] bitty tight pin skirt amen and you can
[1:32:45] absolutely see everything
[1:32:48] little slit in the back so you've got
[1:32:49] enough room to walk something's not
[1:32:50] right
[1:32:52] you don't have to pretend everything's
[1:32:53] right it's not right
[1:32:55] something's wrong i mean that doesn't
[1:32:57] mean you cut them off or don't love them
[1:32:58] or disfellowship or
[1:33:00] they're not of god or don't have the
[1:33:01] holy ghost it's none of those things
[1:33:03] they might need taught they might need
[1:33:06] an understanding
[1:33:12] we've got to be careful where our
[1:33:13] influences come from
[1:33:18] sometimes we're influenced by the world
[1:33:24] sometimes we're influenced by other
[1:33:26] church members
[1:33:28] who are influenced by the world
[1:33:33] and we've got to have some discernment
[1:33:36] and we've got to stick with the word of
[1:33:38] god
[1:33:40] above all let the word be our guide and
[1:33:42] stick with the word of god
[1:33:44] and pray about things and ask for
[1:33:46] discernment and not accept everything
[1:33:48] that walks in because it's a good
[1:33:49] brother a good sister
[1:33:51] nobody's taking that away from their
[1:33:53] good brother good sister
[1:33:54] but that thing's not right
[1:33:57] we don't accept it we don't repeat it we
[1:33:59] don't do the same thing
[1:34:02] a lot of influences come from social
[1:34:03] media
[1:34:07] social media is dangerous
[1:34:12] it's addictive
[1:34:15] there's people on social media that have
[1:34:17] who knows how many followers i don't
[1:34:18] know how all this stuff works
[1:34:20] i just hear about it vaguely but they've
[1:34:22] got so many followers
[1:34:24] and they're called influencers
[1:34:28] so there's a whole new level of
[1:34:29] marketing now where people with products
[1:34:31] are shipping products
[1:34:32] to these people with these internet
[1:34:34] channels or these social media channels
[1:34:36] called influencers and they want them to
[1:34:39] to use their product
[1:34:40] drink their drink wear their clothes
[1:34:42] amen because they know
[1:34:44] that people watch them and are
[1:34:45] influenced by them and if they wear the
[1:34:46] clothes and if they drink the drink and
[1:34:48] they used a certain thing
[1:34:49] that it'll influence others because
[1:34:51] people will copy people
[1:34:54] monkey see monkey do and if we spend all
[1:34:57] day
[1:34:58] on social media checking other people
[1:35:00] and what they're doing
[1:35:01] you have no idea but that thing is
[1:35:03] influencing the way you think and the
[1:35:04] way you feel
[1:35:06] it has an influence and some people just
[1:35:08] can't stand to not know what's going on
[1:35:11] in somebody else's life
[1:35:14] that's a weakness in personality they
[1:35:17] just can't stand
[1:35:19] not knowing what everybody's talking
[1:35:21] about
[1:35:23] i'm telling you it's a blessing to not
[1:35:24] know what everybody's talking about
[1:35:26] it's a blessing to live a separated life
[1:35:28] when you see a fad going through the
[1:35:30] world
[1:35:30] amen and and and you're like what's that
[1:35:33] or when you hear somebody talk about a
[1:35:34] music artist or
[1:35:35] or a sports figure and you have no clue
[1:35:37] who they're talking about that's a good
[1:35:39] thing
[1:35:40] you should thank you should thank the
[1:35:42] lord and say i'm glad i don't know that
[1:35:44] that's the new fashion this year
[1:35:45] i'm not trying to figure out what's the
[1:35:47] new fashion what's the new color for the
[1:35:49] year
[1:35:49] what's the right accessory to wear with
[1:35:51] it forget all of that i want my
[1:35:52] experience to match the word is what
[1:35:54] brother branham said
[1:35:55] i want to be influenced by the word and
[1:35:57] the word only and forget all this other
[1:35:59] influence
[1:36:03] social media you know somebody post you
[1:36:05] know
[1:36:06] i you know whatever i don't know how it
[1:36:08] works i never had it
[1:36:10] you hear people talk about it they post
[1:36:12] something and then you know this is
[1:36:14] wonderful and this is the greatest thing
[1:36:15] ever
[1:36:16] and all we're just loving xyz product
[1:36:19] it's the best thing we've ever had
[1:36:21] and so everybody goes buys xyz product
[1:36:23] and you're
[1:36:24] just starting to come and catch the fad
[1:36:27] when the person that you got it from is
[1:36:28] off to a new one says
[1:36:30] xyz is no good i found a better one
[1:36:33] it's foolish it's childish
[1:36:36] but just follow what follow the leader
[1:36:39] follow the leader
[1:36:40] don't follow people follow the word
[1:36:45] quit following stuff follow the word
[1:36:48] quit getting tied up in social media
[1:36:50] it doesn't matter for much i mean if you
[1:36:53] want to be linked to grandma and aunt
[1:36:55] susie and all that that's one thing
[1:36:58] but but don't be following people and
[1:37:00] following stuff
[1:37:01] and that stuff influences you
[1:37:04] you know we're sheep the bible calls us
[1:37:07] sheep
[1:37:09] guess what we're sheep the quicker we
[1:37:12] realize that the better off we are
[1:37:14] we're influenced by one another and we
[1:37:17] catch influences
[1:37:18] in what's become so dangerous in the
[1:37:20] message now
[1:37:22] is we catch influences from other
[1:37:24] churches
[1:37:27] and we catch influences from each other
[1:37:29] inside the church
[1:37:30] and somebody will pick this up from
[1:37:32] another church just because it's done in
[1:37:34] another message church don't make it
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:39] just because they sang that song and it
[1:37:41] sounded pretty doesn't make it right
[1:37:44] where did it come from what cesspool did
[1:37:47] it come out of
[1:37:48] just because it was done and it sounded
[1:37:50] nice doesn't make it okay
[1:37:52] just because they dress this way doesn't
[1:37:54] make it right
[1:37:56] you see things sweep through and i'm
[1:37:59] always
[1:38:00] so incredibly discouraged sometimes when
[1:38:02] i go to fellowships
[1:38:03] and you just look around you can't help
[1:38:05] it it just grieves you so bad
[1:38:07] you see influences influences influences
[1:38:09] influences
[1:38:10] and it's not the holy ghost influence
[1:38:13] it's people catching one another's
[1:38:14] spirit and one another's influence
[1:38:16] and somebody somewhere tapped into the
[1:38:18] world brought it into the church
[1:38:20] and passed it around and i think the
[1:38:24] devil is duping the children of god the
[1:38:26] devil is deceiving
[1:38:28] why because he's looking for every
[1:38:30] avenue we'll be looking for him over
[1:38:32] here
[1:38:32] and he's sneaking in behind the gate
[1:38:34] right behind us
[1:38:37] we'll be fortifying this he's not going
[1:38:39] to bring any false doctrine my way
[1:38:41] there's not going to be any false
[1:38:42] teaching this way and he's coming
[1:38:44] right through the gate with all kinds of
[1:38:47] immorality and worldliness
[1:38:52] we've got to have spiritual discernments
[1:38:55] these things matter
[1:38:58] songs we sing where we get them from
[1:39:01] they can't be influenced by those things
[1:39:04] the things we wear
[1:39:05] who we pick it up from the way we do our
[1:39:07] hair
[1:39:08] it matters it matters
[1:39:14] praise god
[1:39:18] let's get back to my original analogy or
[1:39:20] might not analogy my life
[1:39:23] with the necklace
[1:39:27] brother branham said a little necklace
[1:39:29] your husband bought you
[1:39:33] that's not big colorful beads that go
[1:39:37] with every shirt
[1:39:39] to understand that's not what he was
[1:39:40] saying
[1:39:43] and i'm just going to tell you like my
[1:39:45] own children like i tell my own children
[1:39:48] these big old long draping necklaces and
[1:39:51] these big beads and these colorful
[1:39:52] things
[1:39:53] they're not modest brother venom said a
[1:39:56] little old necklace your husband bought
[1:39:58] you or something
[1:40:01] not green with the green shirt blue with
[1:40:04] the blue shirt yellow with the
[1:40:07] see that's not what brother ben was
[1:40:08] talking about and that's not what the
[1:40:10] scripture tells us
[1:40:12] that's different than the scriptures
[1:40:16] multiple rings and multiple fingers is
[1:40:18] not modest
[1:40:20] brother benham said if you want to wear
[1:40:21] your wedding ring now i guess that's
[1:40:22] okay
[1:40:23] it's not i don't think that's bad but
[1:40:26] that wasn't
[1:40:26] that wasn't three four rings on
[1:40:28] different fingers that's not what he
[1:40:29] said
[1:40:30] he didn't call that modest when he said
[1:40:32] it's okay to wear your wedding ring
[1:40:34] i'm just giving it to you the way god
[1:40:36] gave it to me
[1:40:38] now you're adults you're mature
[1:40:39] believers you pray about it and you do
[1:40:41] as god leads you to do
[1:40:43] but i'm just telling you as the shepherd
[1:40:44] of the local flock what god showed me
[1:40:47] and what god shared with me and told me
[1:40:49] those things aren't modest
[1:40:52] they're not modest it's not what god
[1:40:54] wants
[1:40:55] now what god wants now is something
[1:40:58] different
[1:40:59] he wants a bride who will live every
[1:41:01] word
[1:41:03] and not use anything the prophet said is
[1:41:05] an excuse to go
[1:41:06] further than what the prophet said but
[1:41:08] to stay with what the prophet said
[1:41:12] something small something petite
[1:41:15] something special something your husband
[1:41:17] bought
[1:41:18] that's what brother bam said now that's
[1:41:20] my opinion i don't think that would be
[1:41:22] bad
[1:41:23] so when you go that way you realize that
[1:41:26] what he said
[1:41:27] and he said it was his opinion and he
[1:41:29] wouldn't think it would be bad
[1:41:30] and so just stay there just stay right
[1:41:33] there
[1:41:35] but the scripture is clear not the
[1:41:38] outward adorning
[1:41:40] of gold and pearls and costly apparel
[1:41:45] you see men's wedding bands have become
[1:41:47] jewelry
[1:41:49] the trends are changing instead of just
[1:41:52] a simple wedding band
[1:41:53] they become elaborate and be colorful
[1:41:55] and you've got men who will wear a
[1:41:56] different band with a different outfit
[1:42:00] that's gone beyond the purpose of a
[1:42:02] wedding band
[1:42:03] it's become adornment they got all these
[1:42:06] funny materials and all these funny
[1:42:08] looks and all this funny stuff
[1:42:10] it's nothing more than the world
[1:42:12] creeping in and changing the original
[1:42:14] temp for something and now
[1:42:15] a men's wedding band has become
[1:42:17] adornment and i never thought we would
[1:42:19] see the day
[1:42:22] well what's wrong with the little gold
[1:42:23] band and now we got to have this
[1:42:25] and we're going to have that and they're
[1:42:26] real fat or they're real skinny they got
[1:42:28] diamonds on them are they
[1:42:29] changing all these it's not wrong you've
[1:42:32] got diamond in your ring don't
[1:42:33] don't don't misplace what i'm saying
[1:42:37] but why is it changing and why is it
[1:42:39] such a fad i tell you like this if it's
[1:42:42] a fad stay away from it
[1:42:45] if the whole world's going one direction
[1:42:46] i want to be going the opposite
[1:42:48] direction
[1:42:50] if everybody's picking up this fad i
[1:42:52] want nothing to do with it
[1:42:56] i want to go another way stay simple
[1:42:59] stay humble stay meek stay
[1:43:02] mild do you understand that's what he
[1:43:06] wants
[1:43:07] when brother branham saw the vision of
[1:43:08] the bride marching in the end time
[1:43:10] amen what did she look like
[1:43:14] brother i said long gowns long sleeves
[1:43:18] hair straight down their back marching
[1:43:21] in stem
[1:43:22] i don't mean that's how you have to
[1:43:23] dress brother branham never condemned
[1:43:26] short sleeves he never condemned any of
[1:43:27] that stuff
[1:43:28] i'm not talking about that but when he
[1:43:30] showed the bride in a vision
[1:43:32] he would show something simple something
[1:43:34] modest
[1:43:35] her beauty did not come from the apparel
[1:43:38] her beauty did not come from a hairstyle
[1:43:40] her beauty did not come from outward
[1:43:41] adorning her beauty was that she was
[1:43:43] marching in step with the word
[1:43:46] that's her beauty and if this bride is
[1:43:49] going to have a beauty about her it's
[1:43:50] going to be the same
[1:43:52] beauty it's going to be the beauty of
[1:43:54] staying
[1:43:55] in step with the word
[1:43:59] this is what the word says i've read to
[1:44:00] you the scriptures amen
[1:44:02] don't don't start calculating i
[1:44:04] encourage you don't go home and start
[1:44:07] don't start splicing quotes together to
[1:44:09] get to do what you wanted to do anyways
[1:44:12] read the quote but go to the scriptures
[1:44:15] read the scriptures and read the quote
[1:44:17] and read the scriptures
[1:44:18] and decide what you're going to do
[1:44:21] because too many people
[1:44:22] have taken the message of brother
[1:44:24] branham and twisted it into lust
[1:44:27] because i want to wear this and i want
[1:44:30] to wear that and i want to look like
[1:44:31] this
[1:44:32] and this is just who i am no it's not
[1:44:34] who he wants you to be
[1:44:36] because he wants you to be a word bride
[1:44:37] to reflect what's written in the word
[1:44:43] amen the bride doesn't wear makeup
[1:44:46] i don't care what anybody told you or
[1:44:48] how you want to twist a quote the bride
[1:44:49] doesn't wear makeup
[1:44:50] the bride does not paint her face
[1:44:53] brother better said it over
[1:44:54] and over and over
[1:44:58] that doesn't mean that she's not allowed
[1:44:59] to cover a blemish
[1:45:01] but she's not to paint her face
[1:45:04] brother man i made that clear remember
[1:45:07] my brother abraham said
[1:45:09] that god always left enough quotes that
[1:45:11] you can take whatever package you think
[1:45:13] belongs to you
[1:45:15] and i'm speaking to you as the shepherd
[1:45:17] of this flock
[1:45:18] shepherd of this flock and only this
[1:45:21] flock
[1:45:22] and i'm telling you what the lord told
[1:45:24] me and i'm telling you what the word of
[1:45:26] god says
[1:45:27] and dozens of other quotes now you've
[1:45:30] got to decide which one belongs to you
[1:45:34] and which one you're going to identify
[1:45:35] with
[1:45:37] because this matters friends it wouldn't
[1:45:40] have happened to me like it did
[1:45:41] yesterday morning if it's not
[1:45:43] important it's important there's things
[1:45:46] coming
[1:45:47] but god wants a bride prepared marching
[1:45:51] in the word
[1:45:52] all the word even the things we think
[1:45:54] are not a big deal
[1:45:56] god is so tuned with his word he wants
[1:45:58] that bride to live
[1:45:59] that word exactly and he'll correct us
[1:46:03] if we don't think the bride doesn't get
[1:46:04] corrected she gets corrected
[1:46:08] god can correct his bride anytime that
[1:46:11] he wants to
[1:46:16] when you go into kohl's and you see the
[1:46:17] shirt hanging there with the big
[1:46:19] necklace take the necklace off and buy
[1:46:21] the shirt
[1:46:23] just because it comes with it doesn't
[1:46:24] mean it has to be worn
[1:46:26] because it's not modest
[1:46:29] we've got to watch what we're doing
[1:46:33] and we've got to be aware all the time
[1:46:36] of what we're doing
[1:46:39] men need to help their wives
[1:46:44] you know that should be self-explanatory
[1:46:47] but it's still
[1:46:48] men need to help their wives because
[1:46:50] you're the high priest of the home
[1:46:53] in and i've made a mistake many times
[1:46:55] and not saying things when i should say
[1:46:57] things
[1:46:58] because i always defaulted to the
[1:46:59] spiritual condition of my wife
[1:47:01] because my wife is godly woman she wants
[1:47:04] to do right i know her heart
[1:47:05] and so i just assume every decision she
[1:47:07] makes right because i know her heart
[1:47:10] but she's not the high priest of the
[1:47:12] home i am
[1:47:14] and when something has to be corrected
[1:47:16] in our home many times god comes to me
[1:47:17] first
[1:47:18] and i would brush it aside because i
[1:47:20] know my wife was a godly woman and
[1:47:22] god would tell her if there was
[1:47:23] something wrong and god's already
[1:47:25] knocking on my heart
[1:47:27] trying to fix something because she
[1:47:29] belongs to me
[1:47:31] and she's under my headship and there's
[1:47:34] nothing wrong with their spiritual
[1:47:35] condition
[1:47:36] a lot of times it's my spiritual
[1:47:38] condition that's the problem
[1:47:40] so god comes to me to bring a correction
[1:47:43] and now it's my job to bring the
[1:47:45] correction to my home
[1:47:46] amen not as a dictator but as a loving
[1:47:48] leader realizing
[1:47:49] that most of the time it's my fault this
[1:47:52] last one was
[1:47:52] my fault completely brother branham said
[1:47:56] a little necklace your husband bought i
[1:47:57] bought it it was little
[1:47:59] but it didn't match the scriptures
[1:48:03] you see it wasn't her fault it was my
[1:48:04] fault god comes to me i've got to fix
[1:48:06] that
[1:48:07] and so men have to help their wives and
[1:48:09] not always default to the fact that your
[1:48:11] wife is spirit-led
[1:48:12] that goes without saying you married a
[1:48:14] spirit-led woman who loves the lord
[1:48:16] there's no problem with that but you
[1:48:17] can't just always
[1:48:19] brush stuff aside when god brings it to
[1:48:21] your attention you've got to deal with
[1:48:22] it brothers
[1:48:23] it's your job to lead that household
[1:48:26] it's your job to leave that
[1:48:27] to lead that sister and if god wants
[1:48:30] something fixed many times
[1:48:32] he'll come right to the head to fix it
[1:48:35] and then when god does that it's always
[1:48:37] the same reaction
[1:48:39] there's a lump that comes in the throat
[1:48:41] you swallow it down
[1:48:43] i hope this goes okay
[1:48:49] why because you don't want to hurt her
[1:48:51] you don't want to hurt anybody you don't
[1:48:52] want to come across strong
[1:48:54] just like what i'm doing today i don't
[1:48:55] want anybody to get hurt
[1:48:57] we're all in the same condition the bars
[1:48:59] were let down
[1:49:00] things crept in that never should have
[1:49:02] been here god wants to straighten it up
[1:49:04] we're all in the same boat i don't want
[1:49:06] anybody to feel bad i don't want anybody
[1:49:08] to feel pointed out
[1:49:09] all right we're all in the same boat i
[1:49:10] told you my story
[1:49:13] but god is lifting us higher than where
[1:49:15] we've been
[1:49:17] what was acceptable is not acceptable
[1:49:19] what was okay is not okay
[1:49:22] god wants a bride lined up with the word
[1:49:25] men need to be men
[1:49:26] they need to have enough courage to help
[1:49:28] their wives and really lead their home
[1:49:31] because she's not going to answer for it
[1:49:33] you are
[1:49:35] if you let it go she's not going to
[1:49:36] answer for it you are
[1:49:39] and that goes for your teenage and young
[1:49:41] adult daughters as well
[1:49:43] we've got to do what god's called us to
[1:49:45] do
[1:49:47] i'm going to read a quote wisdom versus
[1:49:50] faith 1962.
[1:49:52] get some old pictures look at
[1:49:53] grandmother her long skirts braid of
[1:49:55] hair hanging down her back
[1:49:56] she wasn't so attractive to look at look
[1:49:59] at the modern one today little skinned
[1:50:01] down dress that every form she can move
[1:50:03] without sinning
[1:50:04] she can't move without sinning
[1:50:09] why can she not move without sinning
[1:50:13] because if a man looketh upon a woman to
[1:50:15] lust after he's committed
[1:50:16] adultery already with her in his heart
[1:50:18] and brother bennett said what about
[1:50:20] you woman who dressed yourself that way
[1:50:24] and them tight clothes that arouses the
[1:50:26] passions of a man when you know better
[1:50:28] and put it on anyways
[1:50:29] you can't even move without sinning
[1:50:35] i didn't say it prophet did
[1:50:39] what we do matters the way we dress
[1:50:44] matters we've got to keep
[1:50:47] things up not down
[1:50:51] i've seen way too many women every time
[1:50:53] they get around a man or they're just
[1:50:59] i think if i give you 50 bucks will you
[1:51:01] go buy another shirt
[1:51:04] that one obviously is not working
[1:51:09] sometimes these things happen without us
[1:51:10] realizing but when but when we awaken to
[1:51:13] it we say hey
[1:51:13] that's not working let's get another
[1:51:15] garment where i don't have to always be
[1:51:17] pulling and pulling and pulling
[1:51:20] let's just wear one where i never have
[1:51:21] to pull where i'm free to move as i need
[1:51:24] to move
[1:51:25] and if i'm tending my children i got to
[1:51:27] realize i'm bending over to pick up my
[1:51:29] if you've got little tots
[1:51:30] you got to be super careful because
[1:51:32] you're going to get in all kinds of
[1:51:33] awkward positions while you're tending
[1:51:35] your tots
[1:51:39] i mean you've got to be aware of who's
[1:51:40] behind you and who's in front of you
[1:51:47] this is just basics friends this is
[1:51:49] abc's
[1:51:51] but if you're always tugging on your
[1:51:53] clothes to keep it in the right spot and
[1:51:54] make sure
[1:51:55] knees are covered and make sure this is
[1:51:57] a it's wrong don't wear it again
[1:52:01] get close where you can move freely
[1:52:03] where you can cross your legs
[1:52:05] i mean i've sat across from sisters good
[1:52:07] sisters crossed their legs and i see the
[1:52:09] whole back of their thigh and i turn
[1:52:10] away as fast as i can but it's too late
[1:52:12] you can't turn away that fast
[1:52:16] i thought why would a woman want to wear
[1:52:17] something like that
[1:52:21] if there's a chance don't wear it
[1:52:25] it matters what we do it matters what
[1:52:28] kind of pressure we put on our neighbor
[1:52:30] it matters what kind of pressure we put
[1:52:32] on a brother or what kind of pressure we
[1:52:33] put on a sister by the way we're dressed
[1:52:36] god cares the prophet told us god cares
[1:52:40] god cares we don't need extra adornment
[1:52:43] we don't need
[1:52:44] extra accessories we don't need a bunch
[1:52:46] of stuff in our hair
[1:52:49] i mean we just don't need it live simple
[1:52:52] clean
[1:52:53] humble meek that's beautiful
[1:52:57] i think we have the loveliest sisters on
[1:52:59] the planet
[1:53:01] there's a beauty that a that a necklace
[1:53:03] cannot enhance
[1:53:06] and that's the truth there's a beauty in
[1:53:07] our sisters that a necklace
[1:53:09] or a hair adornment will not change one
[1:53:12] drop
[1:53:13] in fact i've seen things that take away
[1:53:16] they don't add to
[1:53:17] the natural beauty that's already there
[1:53:20] there's a beauty that comes with
[1:53:21] holiness there's a beauty that comes
[1:53:23] with modesty
[1:53:24] and every brother in here will tell you
[1:53:25] the same thing it's an absolute
[1:53:27] breathtaking beauty that you destroy
[1:53:29] with adornment
[1:53:32] and it hinders the natural expression of
[1:53:34] the beauty of holiness
[1:53:35] it does not help it
[1:53:38] you don't need those things they're not
[1:53:40] necessary
[1:53:42] but a lot of women
[1:53:45] okay i love you guys
[1:53:50] but i love exposing the devil because
[1:53:52] he's out to trip
[1:53:53] all of us up we've got to be wily
[1:53:59] the young women and i'm not talking
[1:54:01] about the teenagers the young mothers
[1:54:03] and the young women
[1:54:05] dress to get the approval of the other
[1:54:08] young women
[1:54:11] not of men
[1:54:16] and that's where the pressure comes from
[1:54:19] to be as pretty as attractive on par
[1:54:22] with however you want to order it's a
[1:54:24] subconscious there's a subconscious
[1:54:26] thing
[1:54:27] where i've got to be as pretty and i
[1:54:29] mean you can see it when somebody when
[1:54:31] you see
[1:54:32] you know people losing their mind over
[1:54:33] somebody's skirt
[1:54:38] and they're just like yeah that's the
[1:54:41] prettiest skirt i've ever seen in my
[1:54:43] brother
[1:54:47] why was it worn what was the motive
[1:54:50] behind it
[1:54:52] i mean now we're getting right down to
[1:54:54] heart surgery
[1:54:57] but every woman has a natural desire to
[1:54:59] be pretty
[1:55:01] and the last thing she wants is to be
[1:55:03] the least attractive
[1:55:05] so there's a pressure especially in the
[1:55:09] young married women i don't know why but
[1:55:11] that's where it is the greatest
[1:55:13] there's a pressure in the young married
[1:55:14] woman to be pretty
[1:55:17] and to be as pretty and god forbid to be
[1:55:20] prettier
[1:55:22] but i'm telling you it's there i know
[1:55:24] it's there
[1:55:26] and the devil takes advantage of those
[1:55:28] things
[1:55:30] we've got to be secure in who we are
[1:55:33] not insecure if you've got your
[1:55:36] husband's undying devotion and love and
[1:55:38] if he thinks you're beautiful
[1:55:39] why do you care what anybody else in the
[1:55:41] world thinks
[1:55:42] brother branham said a woman has a
[1:55:44] natural desire to be pretty for
[1:55:46] her husband
[1:55:50] but i mean i'm telling you
[1:55:53] you'll put something on your husband
[1:55:54] won't say a word about it but three or
[1:55:56] four sisters in the church will say it
[1:55:57] and you'll walk home happy
[1:55:59] it's not supposed to be for the other
[1:56:01] sisters it's supposed to be for your
[1:56:02] husband
[1:56:03] you have a desire to be pretty for your
[1:56:05] husband does your husband like it does
[1:56:07] your husband want it
[1:56:08] is that what he's after then who's it
[1:56:12] for
[1:56:15] i know that's cutting some people deep
[1:56:17] but it's the truth
[1:56:20] we've got to quit being influenced by
[1:56:22] other things in the spirit of god
[1:56:25] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes
[1:56:28] the pride of life that's not
[1:56:31] what we're supposed to be influenced by
[1:56:34] that's worldliness
[1:56:36] and it's got to go that doesn't
[1:56:40] that sometimes has nothing to do with
[1:56:42] how much skin is showing or how tight
[1:56:43] the clothes are
[1:56:45] sometimes it's a wrong motivation for a
[1:56:47] totally different reason
[1:56:49] but we've got to be secure in who god
[1:56:51] made us
[1:56:52] we've got to say this is my husband he
[1:56:54] loves me
[1:56:56] if if if everybody else if nobody else
[1:57:00] ever compliments my shirt my skirt my
[1:57:02] hair
[1:57:03] then i'm happy as long as my husband's
[1:57:04] happy and god's happy
[1:57:07] see we gotta we gotta come back to the
[1:57:09] bible
[1:57:10] back to the message and all of these
[1:57:12] things have got to stop
[1:57:14] it's got to fade away we've got to be
[1:57:17] the real reality
[1:57:24] brother brahm said in the message
[1:57:25] influence
[1:57:27] you know there's so many of us and most
[1:57:30] all of us
[1:57:30] influence somebody by the things we do
[1:57:33] and the way we live and the things we
[1:57:35] say we influence somebody
[1:57:38] somebody is watching your life and then
[1:57:40] when we profess to be christians what
[1:57:41] type of life should we live if somebody
[1:57:43] is watching us
[1:57:44] and your life that you live well will
[1:57:47] reflect on the influence on somebody
[1:57:50] it might be their eternal destination
[1:57:52] will rest upon the way you live
[1:57:54] and the things you do for they watch you
[1:57:58] i'd like to finish it with this thought
[1:58:00] this morning
[1:58:01] on influence we see all these things
[1:58:04] that have influenced us we've been
[1:58:05] influenced with wrong decisions wrong
[1:58:07] desires
[1:58:08] wrong actions there's a lot of influence
[1:58:12] but now god wants to turn our attention
[1:58:14] to the fact that we are
[1:58:16] also influencing and to me
[1:58:19] this becomes the this becomes the most
[1:58:22] serious
[1:58:22] part of the whole morning if you can
[1:58:25] catch this this is the most serious part
[1:58:27] of it all
[1:58:28] because it's not we got to be careful of
[1:58:31] our influence who's influencing us and
[1:58:32] where
[1:58:32] they're getting it from and what we're
[1:58:34] allowing the influences that we're
[1:58:35] allowing in the church and in our life
[1:58:37] we've got to be careful of that
[1:58:38] but the most critical part if i could
[1:58:40] get it to you today is the fact that
[1:58:42] every one of us are influencing somebody
[1:58:44] else
[1:58:46] and that's a responsibility that we
[1:58:49] carry ourselves we'll be responsible for
[1:58:53] god for how we influence somebody else
[1:58:55] when we know not to do these things
[1:58:58] we've been told not to dress this way
[1:58:59] we've been told not to paint our face
[1:59:01] and we're making we've been told not to
[1:59:02] wear
[1:59:03] tight clothes we've been told we've been
[1:59:05] told we've been told and today
[1:59:07] you've been told and told and told
[1:59:09] spelled out things people don't like to
[1:59:11] spell out but i'm comfortable spelling
[1:59:13] them out because god spelled them out to
[1:59:14] me
[1:59:18] we've been told and told and told and
[1:59:21] now there's a great responsibility
[1:59:24] that if we've been told these things and
[1:59:26] we repeat them and have a negative
[1:59:28] influence on somebody else and cause
[1:59:29] somebody
[1:59:30] else to sin by our actions then we are
[1:59:32] responsible before god
[1:59:35] and we've got to start being careful
[1:59:36] about what we say and what we do and
[1:59:39] what we praise and what we mock
[1:59:44] we got to be careful of what we
[1:59:45] criticize
[1:59:48] you criticize something godly you better
[1:59:50] be careful
[1:59:52] you criticize one of god's children and
[1:59:54] put a thought in somebody's mind towards
[1:59:56] them
[1:59:56] you got to be careful
[1:59:59] if we call something old-fashioned
[2:00:01] that's godly you got to be careful
[2:00:04] amen we've got to be careful because
[2:00:07] everything we do is influencing somebody
[2:00:09] else
[2:00:10] this is the important part the way we
[2:00:12] wear our hair
[2:00:13] the way we wear our clothes the way we
[2:00:15] speak with our mouths the way we carry
[2:00:17] ourselves
[2:00:17] is influencing somebody else and we need
[2:00:21] to be conscious of that
[2:00:23] it's been too many times in insecurity
[2:00:25] trying to get the approval of others and
[2:00:27] not realizing
[2:00:28] and are stretching for approval we're
[2:00:29] giving a wrong influence
[2:00:32] instead of backing up and saying i'm
[2:00:34] secure with god
[2:00:36] who god made me and i want only his word
[2:00:39] and if you can come to
[2:00:40] that place and walk in his word and walk
[2:00:42] by the leadership of the holy ghost
[2:00:43] now there's a holy ghost leadership and
[2:00:45] influence coming out
[2:00:47] and influencing others for the right
[2:00:49] things not the wrong things
[2:00:52] he says again in the message influence
[2:00:57] you must be a servant to christ to stay
[2:00:59] honorable with that word
[2:01:01] because that word will reflect itself
[2:01:03] through you and you're going to
[2:01:04] influence somebody that's watching your
[2:01:06] life
[2:01:07] young people likewise business missing
[2:01:09] the same way he's talking about
[2:01:10] ministers but
[2:01:11] young people likewise the apostle paul
[2:01:15] told timothy don't despise
[2:01:16] don't let no man despise thy youth but
[2:01:19] be an example
[2:01:22] i say that to the young people here our
[2:01:24] youth are an example
[2:01:27] don't let nobody despise your youth and
[2:01:28] you don't despise it yourselves
[2:01:30] because many of you are an example to
[2:01:32] the older you can live a standard that
[2:01:34] some older folks can't live
[2:01:36] they haven't caught the revelation they
[2:01:38] haven't come to the understanding
[2:01:40] you guys are clean clean faced dressing
[2:01:42] clean
[2:01:44] is that right and there's some older
[2:01:47] folks who haven't caught the revelation
[2:01:48] you've caught
[2:01:50] i say god bless you don't let
[2:01:53] don't let no outside influence from
[2:01:55] another youth group and another church
[2:01:57] and some other believer
[2:01:58] or even older people that you look at
[2:02:00] don't let them change what you're doing
[2:02:02] you walk with the word you stay you
[2:02:04] started fresh and clean stay fresh and
[2:02:06] clean
[2:02:10] stay that way don't be influenced by
[2:02:12] what the older people are doing and
[2:02:13] they're wearing that in their way
[2:02:14] you guys be an example and you are
[2:02:19] you are
[2:02:25] further in the same message he says so
[2:02:27] just keep that in mind
[2:02:29] that we're bringing influences every day
[2:02:33] and the life that you live proves what's
[2:02:34] on the inside of you
[2:02:37] you cannot change that it reflects every
[2:02:38] person reflects outside what he is
[2:02:40] inside
[2:02:41] and if we take the testimony of being
[2:02:43] christians i think that that is one of
[2:02:45] the most solemn things that a man or
[2:02:47] woman boy or girl could do
[2:02:49] when he takes on the name of christ that
[2:02:51] he is going to be a representative of
[2:02:53] christ
[2:02:54] you should watch every move you make
[2:02:59] because somebody is watching you
[2:03:02] should watch what jokes you talk about
[2:03:05] what jokes you tell
[2:03:07] brother branham said he felt condemned
[2:03:09] when convicted one day
[2:03:10] he says i'm always joking and cutting up
[2:03:12] i shouldn't do that
[2:03:14] it's the prophet of god why it's an
[2:03:17] influence
[2:03:19] we're influencing somebody else
[2:03:25] it says in questions and answers 1964.
[2:03:29] said i'm here to try to help you because
[2:03:30] i love you you're my children that i
[2:03:32] have begotten to christ i claim every
[2:03:34] one of you i claim you tonight
[2:03:35] i claim you all the time i always claim
[2:03:38] you as my brother and sister you're my
[2:03:39] children
[2:03:40] i'm your father in the gospel not
[2:03:42] fathers it would be a priest
[2:03:43] i'm your father in the gospel as paul
[2:03:45] said there i've begotten you to christ
[2:03:47] now i spouse you to christ that's
[2:03:49] engaged you to christ as a chaste virgin
[2:03:51] don't let me down don't let me down you
[2:03:53] stay a chaste virgin
[2:03:55] how will i do it brother branham stay
[2:03:57] right with the word
[2:03:59] you got that stay right with the word
[2:04:03] we've got the word on these things i
[2:04:05] talked about stay with the word
[2:04:08] live clean and pure have nothing to do
[2:04:11] with the things of the world
[2:04:12] if you love if the love of it's in your
[2:04:15] heart say oh jesus please take that away
[2:04:17] from me
[2:04:17] i don't want to be like that i don't
[2:04:20] mean just to be some person that's
[2:04:22] saying this
[2:04:23] i mean to be a genuine believer believe
[2:04:25] jesus christ and live for him every day
[2:04:27] don't do no evil why because somebody's
[2:04:31] watching us
[2:04:32] and it matters let's close by reading
[2:04:36] second peter chapter 3 together
[2:04:42] musicians if you want to make your way
[2:04:44] up brother tommy come on up
[2:04:53] second peter 3
[2:04:56] and 9.

[2:05:07] the lord is not slack concerning his
[2:05:09] promises summoning count slackness
[2:05:12] but is longsuffering to us we're not
[2:05:13] willing that any should perish but that
[2:05:15] all should come to repentance
[2:05:17] but the day of the lord will come as a
[2:05:18] thief in the night in which the heavens
[2:05:20] shall pass away with a great noise
[2:05:22] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[2:05:24] heat
[2:05:25] the earth also in the works that are
[2:05:27] therein shall be burned up
[2:05:29] seeing then that all these things shall
[2:05:31] be dissolved
[2:05:33] what manner of persons ought you to be
[2:05:35] in all holy conversation and godliness
[2:05:38] seeing it's all going to burn it's all
[2:05:41] going to burn
[2:05:42] our houses our jobs our clothes are it's
[2:05:44] all going to burn
[2:05:46] everything is going to be destroyed and
[2:05:49] it's coming fast
[2:05:52] what manner of persons aren't we to be
[2:05:54] in all holy conversation holy living
[2:05:56] holy lifestyle
[2:05:57] and godliness looking for and hasting
[2:05:59] unto the coming of the day of god
[2:06:01] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[2:06:03] be dissolved
[2:06:03] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[2:06:05] heat nevertheless
[2:06:06] we according to his promise look for a
[2:06:08] new heavens and a new earth wherein
[2:06:10] dwelleth righteousness
[2:06:11] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[2:06:13] for such things be diligent that you may
[2:06:15] be found of
[2:06:16] him in peace without spot and blameless
[2:06:21] is that what you want to be let's all
[2:06:23] stand
[2:06:28] god is good friends
[2:06:35] those these are not my favorite services
[2:06:37] to preach i'll just tell you that
[2:06:40] i like the exciting things but
[2:06:43] this is exciting
[2:06:46] god loves his children so much that he's
[2:06:50] going to keep us
[2:06:50] right on track not a step to the right
[2:06:53] not a step to the left but
[2:06:55] right down the middle of your road i
[2:06:57] don't want the permissible god i want
[2:06:59] the perfect will of god
[2:07:01] i don't want my own desires i want his
[2:07:02] desires for me
[2:07:04] i've gone my own way and it's not ever
[2:07:06] done me good
[2:07:08] i i've i've pushed the edge and the
[2:07:11] boundary of things and it's never worked
[2:07:13] out good for me
[2:07:14] i said god keep me in the center of your
[2:07:16] will if i step to the right or step to
[2:07:18] the left
[2:07:19] correct me lord jesus and bring me back
[2:07:21] to the very sin of your will
[2:07:24] tell your friends god wants us to live
[2:07:27] the life
[2:07:29] it's not just believing the doctrines
[2:07:32] it's living the doctrines
[2:07:35] he's not concerned with what we
[2:07:37] intellectually can reason and understand
[2:07:40] what he wants is a manifestation a life
[2:07:43] of that word lived out in flesh he wants
[2:07:46] it lived in the teenagers and the boys
[2:07:48] and girls and the moms and dads
[2:07:50] and the sisters and the brothers he
[2:07:51] wants that word in
[2:07:53] flesh alive to the world that's what
[2:07:56] matters to god
[2:07:58] that's what he's trying to point us to
[2:07:59] that's where he wants us to be
[2:08:02] i tell you friends things are coming
[2:08:05] things are coming and this is part of
[2:08:07] the preparation
[2:08:10] how you know how how can
[2:08:13] wearing a necklace or not when our
[2:08:15] necklace be part of the preparation
[2:08:18] it's about the word we're being prepared
[2:08:21] by
[2:08:22] the word and we're coming in line with
[2:08:23] the word and we're forgetting
[2:08:25] our ideas and taking the word that's
[2:08:27] preparation
[2:08:28] because when we come to that time it's
[2:08:30] going to be the word
[2:08:31] and the word only the bride will have
[2:08:35] the word
[2:08:38] and thus saith the lord or they keep
[2:08:40] still
[2:08:41] he's teaching us to line to the word not
[2:08:44] our ideas
[2:08:45] and not take quotes and manipulate them
[2:08:47] to get what we want but stay with the
[2:08:49] word
[2:08:50] and watch the quote with the word they
[2:08:53] go together
