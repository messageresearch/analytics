[14:50] [Music]
[15:04] [Music]
[15:14] let's bow our heads together and pray
[15:18] dear Lord Jesus we love you father
[15:21] we counted a privileged Lord to be
[15:24] gathered here together
[15:25] and Lord we know that we've come because
[15:27] you've drawn us here
[15:29] it's by your mercy and your grace and
[15:31] our lives that you've watched over us
[15:33] and you've kept us this far
[15:35] and you're drawing us constantly to a
[15:37] closer walk
[15:38] we all we thank you for that Lord and we
[15:40] come together Lord to bring honor and
[15:43] glory to your name to walk in obedience
[15:45] Lord to your commandment
[15:47] well we just ask God that you would take
[15:49] control here this evening and as we look
[15:52] into your word Lord may you come on the
[15:54] scene and break the bread of life to us
[15:56] Lord may you use the vessel here
[15:58] standing here under your control Lord
[16:00] and bring forth your Eternal Word Lord
[16:02] for an eternal purpose and maybe walk in
[16:05] that purpose give us the instructions we
[16:07] have need of tonight and may you take
[16:09] preeminence among us and have your way
[16:11] Lord may you get glory in it all we pray
[16:14] in Jesus Christ's name amen
[16:18] then while we're standing let's look at
[16:20] the Book of Mark together in Mark
[16:22] chapter 16. and we'll begin in verse 15.
[16:28] for a title tonight I'd like to minister
[16:31] on the battle is the Lord's and yours
[16:34] the battle is the Lord's and yours and I
[16:37] hope that that title will make sense as
[16:39] we move forward amen and we'll look at
[16:41] Mark chapter 16 uh verse 15 and really I
[16:45] just want to continue some thoughts from
[16:47] Sunday and just keep moving in that
[16:49] direction some things we didn't have a
[16:51] chance to finish
[16:53] um then let us begin here in verse 15.
[16:57] and he said unto them go you into all
[16:59] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[17:01] Creature he that believeth in his
[17:03] baptized shall be saved but he that
[17:04] believeth not shall be damned and these
[17:07] signs shall follow them that believe in
[17:09] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[17:11] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[17:13] take up serpents and if they drink any
[17:15] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[17:17] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[17:18] shall recover so then after the Lord had
[17:22] spoken unto them he was received up into
[17:24] heaven
[17:25] and sat on the right hand of God and
[17:28] they went forth and preached everywhere
[17:30] the Lord working with them and
[17:32] confirming the word with signs following
[17:35] amen and God bless you as you take your
[17:38] seats
[17:39] and when I really want to hone in on
[17:42] that last verse and that last part of
[17:45] that last verse in the in the last verse
[17:48] reads and they went forth and preached
[17:49] everywhere the Lord working with them
[17:53] it was a combined effort amen they had
[17:56] to go but they didn't go alone and the
[17:58] Lord was working with them and that's a
[18:01] it's an amazing statement to me that the
[18:04] Lord was working with them and
[18:07] confirming the word with signs following
[18:09] so they weren't on their own neither was
[18:12] God working independently of the
[18:13] disciples or the disciples working
[18:15] independently of God but they were
[18:17] working in conjunction together
[18:19] if we could turn to the Book of Exodus
[18:22] and I I want to take a look as we as we
[18:24] build this thought through a couple of
[18:26] examples here
[18:28] and we'll go all the way back to the
[18:29] Book of Exodus chapter 33 and we'll read
[18:33] a verse here and then we're going to go
[18:34] to numbers 33. so Exodus 33 then we'll
[18:37] jump to numbers 33. so in Exodus 33 I'm
[18:41] going to start with verse one we'll read
[18:45] verse 1 and 2.
[18:48] and the Lord said unto Moses depart and
[18:51] go up hence thou and the people which
[18:53] thou has brought up out of the land of
[18:55] Egypt unto the land which I swear into
[18:57] Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying
[18:59] unto thy seed will I give it and I will
[19:03] send an angel before thee and I will
[19:05] drive out the Canaanite the Amorite the
[19:07] hittite the parasite the hivite and the
[19:10] jebusite so I just want to highlight a
[19:12] few things here he says go up to the
[19:15] land that I swear unto the thy fathers
[19:18] and I will give it to the unto thy seed
[19:22] will I give it so God says I'm going to
[19:24] give you this land then he says I will
[19:26] send an angel before thee and I will
[19:28] drive out all the inhabitants of the
[19:30] land the Canaanite and the hid tie so we
[19:32] know that God is giving them the land
[19:34] and God's going to drive them out is
[19:35] that right so let's go over to numbers
[19:37] 33.
[19:40] this is after their Wilderness Journey
[19:42] after the 40 Years of wandering in the
[19:44] wilderness he comes and he repeats the
[19:46] instructions again through Moses and
[19:48] Moses giving instructions to the
[19:50] children of Israel and in numbers 33
[19:53] let's read in verse 50. numbers 33 and
[19:56] verse 50.
[19:59] and the Lord spake unto Moses in the
[20:01] plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
[20:03] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[20:06] and say unto them when you were passed
[20:08] over Jordan unto the land of Canaan then
[20:10] ye shall drive out all the inhabitants
[20:14] I thought he said he was going to do
[20:16] that
[20:17] now he's saying ye shall drive out all
[20:20] of the inhabitants of the land from
[20:22] before you and destroy all their
[20:23] pictures and destroy all their molten
[20:25] images and quite pluck down all their
[20:27] high places and ye shall dispossess the
[20:30] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[20:32] therein for I have given you the land to
[20:34] possess him and ye shall divide the land
[20:37] by lot for an inheritance among your
[20:39] families and to the more you shall give
[20:41] the more inheritance and to the fewer
[20:43] you shall give the less inheritance
[20:45] Every Man's inheritance shall be in the
[20:47] place where his lot falleth according to
[20:49] the tribe of your fathers ye shall
[20:51] inherit it but if ye will not drive out
[20:54] the inhabitants of the land from before
[20:56] you then it shall come to pass that
[20:59] Those whom which you let remain of them
[21:01] shall be Pricks in your ears and thorns
[21:04] in your sides and shall Vex you in the
[21:06] land wherein you dwell
[21:07] so if we compare Exodus 33 with numbers
[21:10] 33 God says I've promised the land to
[21:14] your fathers I'm giving you the land and
[21:16] I will drive them I'll send my angel
[21:18] before them and I'll drive them all out
[21:19] and in numbers 33 he says now go into
[21:22] the land and you drive out the
[21:23] inhabitants and if you fail to drive
[21:26] them out they'll be thorns in your sides
[21:28] and Pricks in your in your eyes
[21:31] so then you read this and you're
[21:32] confused who's supposed to drive them
[21:35] out is it supposed to be God or is it
[21:37] supposed to be the children of Israel
[21:38] and the answer is yes
[21:41] amen
[21:43] brother Branham says uh and the message
[21:46] the Good Shepherd of the sheep he says
[21:48] look God told Israel way down in Egypt I
[21:50] have given you Palestine now he could
[21:53] have just went up there and
[21:54] excommunicated the whole thing run them
[21:56] all out with a plague kill them all off
[21:58] he could have went up there and sent
[22:00] fear among them and draved them out of
[22:02] the country but he said Israel it's
[22:03] yours you go get it
[22:06] they had to fight for every inch of
[22:07] ground they stood on God has a certain
[22:10] way of accomplishing his word amen he
[22:13] makes the promise but he's got the way
[22:15] of bringing his promise to pass
[22:17] and and another message just a couple
[22:19] months after this and the message stands
[22:21] still he says one day when the children
[22:23] of God was coming in by the word of God
[22:25] taking the land that God had given now
[22:27] remember God gave them the land down in
[22:30] Egypt he said that land is yours every
[22:32] bit of it now the people today are
[22:35] expecting God to reach down get them by
[22:37] the neck say yes that's right you bring
[22:39] me out clean me off heal me and I'll
[22:42] believe you God doesn't do his business
[22:44] that way he gives you the promise but
[22:47] you have got to fight for every inch of
[22:49] ground that you possess
[22:51] why didn't God go over there and just
[22:52] run out all the amorites and the
[22:54] Hittites the parasites and all of them
[22:56] why didn't he just run them all out no
[22:58] Israel had something to do and you've
[23:01] got something to do God said the land is
[23:04] yours go possess it
[23:06] amen this is a a tremendous principle
[23:09] but God is in one place saying I want to
[23:13] send the angel of the Lord and can you
[23:14] imagine if you're if you're Israel that
[23:16] day and you hear that oh man how
[23:19] exciting that is because I mean God is
[23:21] going to send his Angel before you and
[23:24] he's going to drive out all the
[23:25] inhabitants amen and brother Ram talks
[23:27] about this you know how their
[23:29] imagination must have run they're just
[23:31] going to walk across Jordan and walk in
[23:33] and start putting their stuff in the
[23:35] houses and and then enjoying it they
[23:37] didn't realize that the way God was
[23:39] going to send his Angel and drive them
[23:41] out is he was going to come in a people
[23:43] and be working through a people and
[23:45] driving the inhabitants out of the land
[23:46] that's why he would come and say you
[23:49] drive them out and if you fail to drive
[23:51] them out and you can say but God you
[23:52] said you would drive them out and he
[23:54] says yes I will drive them out now you
[23:56] drive them out and if you don't drive
[23:57] them out yeah so who's driving them out
[24:02] [Music]
[24:03] you realize the children of Israel
[24:04] without God could do nothing
[24:07] but also God chose to do nothing without
[24:10] the children of Israel
[24:12] it's not that God couldn't but he chose
[24:14] not to
[24:15] amen so once we understand God's program
[24:19] if we can understand it through the
[24:20] Bible then we can understand it in our
[24:22] lives
[24:23] because so many times we want God to do
[24:25] wonderful things for us and God wants us
[24:27] to get up and take the word and put it
[24:30] in action and start doing what he's
[24:32] called us to do and then he's promised
[24:34] to be there to help us to drive out to
[24:36] deliver to bring the word to pass but
[24:38] not when we sit on our haunches and wait
[24:40] for God to move God's told us to move
[24:43] he's given us the word and the a
[24:45] wonderful example in the end time of how
[24:47] to make the word work
[24:50] amen I want to look at another story
[24:53] here if we go to First Samuel together
[24:56] this one I I really like
[24:59] first Samuel
[25:06] first Samuel 17.
[25:14] and verse 45 first Samuel 17 and verse
[25:16] 45.
[25:22] the story of David and Goliath so we
[25:24] know you know all the background of this
[25:26] we're going to cut right in here to the
[25:28] middle
[25:29] then said David to the Philistine thou
[25:31] comst to me with a sword and with a
[25:33] spear and with a shield but I come to
[25:34] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[25:36] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[25:38] thou Hast defied
[25:40] this day where the Lord delivered thee
[25:42] into my hand and I will smite thee and
[25:45] take thine head from thee and I will
[25:46] give thy carcasses of the host of the
[25:48] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[25:51] the air into the wild beast of the earth
[25:52] and all the Earth may know that there is
[25:55] a God in Israel and all this assembly
[25:57] shall know that the Lord's saveth not
[25:59] with sword and spear for the battle is
[26:02] the Lord's and he will give you into our
[26:04] hands amen
[26:06] let's keep reading
[26:08] and it came to pass when the Philistine
[26:10] arose and came and Drew nigh to David to
[26:14] meet David that David hastened and ran
[26:16] toward the Army to meet the Philistine
[26:18] and David put his hand in his bag and
[26:20] took dense a stone and slaying it and
[26:22] smote the Philistine in his forehead and
[26:24] the stone sunk into his forehead and he
[26:27] fell upon his face to the Earth so David
[26:29] I love this so David prevailed over the
[26:33] philistine
[26:35] so David prevailed over the Philistine
[26:38] with a sling with a stone and smote the
[26:41] Philistine so who prevailed over the
[26:44] Philistine David who did David say who
[26:46] was going to win the victory he said the
[26:48] battle is the Lord
[26:51] this is what brother Branham says says
[26:53] now David said you meet me as a
[26:55] Philistine with armor and spear but I
[26:56] meet you in the name of the Lord God of
[26:58] Israel watch he had five Stones he had
[27:00] five fingers the sling wrapped in
[27:02] j-e-s-u-s f-a-i-t-a faith in Jesus here
[27:06] he comes something has to happen I tell
[27:09] you when he turned that stone loose the
[27:12] spirit of God caught into that stone and
[27:15] slew Goliath
[27:16] I love this cut his head off and all the
[27:20] others weakened down in the armies of
[27:21] Israel took courage and they cut
[27:23] Philistines Plum to the walls so then
[27:26] you have to say who killed Goliath
[27:29] was it God or was it David
[27:31] and once again the answer is yes
[27:34] because God Amen is not the one who
[27:37] slung the stone David slung the stone
[27:39] but God took hold of that stone amen
[27:41] according to the prophet and drove it to
[27:43] its Mark amen God needed a man on the
[27:46] scene to work through he needed somebody
[27:48] with faith in God and the promise of God
[27:51] that'll have the courage to go stand
[27:53] there and sling the stone but David by
[27:55] himself could not have killed Goliath it
[27:58] was not David's expert Marksmanship that
[28:01] killed Goliath it was the battle was the
[28:03] Lord's it was the hand of the Lord that
[28:05] smoked Goliath
[28:07] but he was using a vessel
[28:09] a chosen vessel
[28:12] and there's no difference between those
[28:14] stories and the day and age we live in
[28:17] amen the same thing holds true today the
[28:20] same principles are true that God is
[28:22] working through flesh amen we just got
[28:25] to have confidence in the flesh that
[28:27] he's working through
[28:29] amen I want to look at one more in the
[28:30] book of Hebrews it will turn together to
[28:32] Hebrews chapter 11.
[28:45] it's so amazing in all of these stories
[28:48] that when Goliath when he begins to make
[28:50] his boast and defy the armies of the
[28:53] Living God
[28:55] could have smote him dead instantly
[28:58] lightning bolt there could have been
[29:00] wild beast there him there could have
[29:02] been a plague that hits him I mean he
[29:04] could have had a massive heart attack
[29:05] and killed over dead God can take
[29:07] Vengeance for himself
[29:11] but God has coupled himself with
[29:14] Humanity
[29:15] to accomplish his word and his purpose
[29:18] and it's so good for us to see this in
[29:21] the scriptures and to understand it
[29:22] because it'll give us courage to live in
[29:25] this life and understand that it's not
[29:27] just us by ourselves amen we can't sit
[29:30] and wait for God to do everything in us
[29:32] do nothing neither by our own efforts
[29:34] can we accomplish anything it has to be
[29:36] God in us God With Us God through us or
[29:39] nothing will happen but we still have to
[29:41] have courage that God is with us and
[29:44] that God the battle is the Lord's
[29:47] and I love how the Bible is written
[29:49] because God is it's amazing you never
[29:52] find God as Petty you never find God as
[29:55] a a
[29:57] unwilling to share Glory because God now
[30:00] will give glory to David for killing
[30:03] Goliath and now they'll sing songs about
[30:05] David and about his mighty victories and
[30:08] that doesn't bother God on the least
[30:10] and then the Bible were written that
[30:12] that you know now the the Israelites and
[30:15] campaign in battle after battle the
[30:18] Israelites smote this nation the
[30:19] Israelites smote this nation and they
[30:21] conquered this city and they conquered
[30:23] that City amen and it's as if they did
[30:25] it all by themselves knowing good and
[30:27] well that as soon as they left God they
[30:29] could conquer no one else
[30:31] so it was the angel the Lord and the
[30:33] camp it was the angel Lord going before
[30:35] them that was giving them Victory but
[30:37] God was not willing to share the victory
[30:40] not he was not so small that he wasn't
[30:42] willing to share the victory with his
[30:44] children
[30:45] and would would say they defeated they
[30:49] won they won the battle knowing good and
[30:51] well it wasn't them it was God with them
[30:55] the same thing with the disciples when
[30:57] they would go after the resurrection of
[30:59] Christ amen and they would lay hands on
[31:01] the sick and and they would speak with
[31:03] new tongues and and all of these things
[31:05] that they would do the Lord went and was
[31:07] working with them
[31:09] confirming his word with signs
[31:12] so now I want to look at Hebrews 11.
[31:15] verse 17.
[31:18] nope not verse 17 verse 7.
[31:22] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[31:25] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[31:27] fear prepared an ark through the saving
[31:30] of his house by the which he condemned
[31:32] the world and became heir of the
[31:33] righteousness which is by faith
[31:35] so I love this in the book of Hebrews
[31:37] because the Hebrews chapter 11 we know
[31:40] is the faith chapter it's also you know
[31:42] the Heroes of Faith it's almost like the
[31:44] Hall of Fame and in in verse 7 it tells
[31:48] us that
[31:51] that Noah moved by fear prepared an ark
[31:55] to the saving of his house
[31:57] so it's almost like Noah
[32:00] saved his house
[32:02] but who told him that there was going to
[32:04] be a flood
[32:06] who told him he needed an ark and who
[32:08] gave him Specific Instructions with
[32:10] height length width and and Specific
[32:13] Instructions what wood to use and how to
[32:15] pitch the wood and how to make it it was
[32:18] God who gave him specific instructions
[32:20] on how to make an ark and that he needed
[32:22] an ark and that it was going to rain
[32:24] amen who saved his household it was God
[32:27] who saved Noah's household
[32:29] but when you go to Hebrews 11 Noah
[32:32] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[32:34] household amen Noah was the one who
[32:37] hammered the nails
[32:39] he's the one who cut the tree to plain
[32:41] the wood he's the one who took the word
[32:44] of God and he obeyed God's commandment
[32:46] and he and he fashioned the ark together
[32:49] without God there's no Ark
[32:54] I also would like to say without Noah
[32:55] there's no Ark
[33:00] without God there's no Ark without Noah
[33:03] there's no Ark
[33:05] Noah could never have done it without
[33:07] God
[33:09] and God chose not to do it without Noah
[33:15] and then Noah prepared an ark to the
[33:19] saving of his house
[33:21] his whole house was saved because of
[33:24] what he did
[33:25] the action he took but he could have
[33:28] never taken the action if God hadn't
[33:30] given him the word
[33:33] amen
[33:36] you remember when brother Brennan went
[33:37] beyond the curtain of time
[33:40] and the sister come up to him and said
[33:42] she was a beautiful young woman she come
[33:43] up to him and said God bless you my
[33:44] precious sister and the voice that was
[33:46] with him said don't you recognize her he
[33:49] says no he says she was past 80 I think
[33:51] he said past 80 when you led her to the
[33:53] Lord and no wonder she she's so happy
[33:55] and no wonder she calls you a precious
[33:58] precious brother
[33:59] and it's amazing how even in that realm
[34:02] in the sixth Dimension even that angel
[34:04] the Lord that's speaking to brother
[34:06] Branham says she was past 80 when you
[34:09] led her to the Lord
[34:11] as if brother Branham could do anything
[34:13] by himself
[34:14] as if he could lead anybody that the
[34:17] father's not first drawing but yet even
[34:19] in that realm amen he gets credit for
[34:22] the victory
[34:24] knowing good and well he couldn't have
[34:26] ever acted independently he could have
[34:28] never convinced anybody his words his
[34:30] preaching could have never saved anybody
[34:32] it was God who saves it was God who
[34:34] draws but God chose to use that vessel
[34:38] Amen to preach the message and they used
[34:40] that that vessel Amen to bring a bride
[34:43] out of denominationalism
[34:45] and for that amen even in the sixth
[34:48] Dimension he's awarded credit for that
[34:52] I just love it
[34:54] I love it
[34:57] let's look at Acts chapter 19.
[35:01] we'll keep working in this thought
[35:08] Acts chapter 19.
[35:20] in verse 11 Acts Chapter 19 Verse 11 and
[35:23] God wrought special Miracles by the
[35:26] hands of Paul
[35:27] I love this
[35:29] and God wrought
[35:31] by the hands of Paul
[35:34] [Laughter]
[35:36] amen
[35:38] and God wrought special Miracles by the
[35:41] hands of Paul
[35:44] he needed a pair of hands
[35:47] God needed a pair of hands there had to
[35:49] be a Paul that would submit to God and
[35:51] yield his vessel to God God wrought the
[35:54] Miracles but where by the hands of Paul
[35:58] and God wrought special Miracles by the
[36:00] hands of Paul so that from his body were
[36:02] brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and
[36:04] aprons and the diseases departed from
[36:06] them and the evil spirits went out of
[36:08] them so that even from his own physical
[36:10] being they would take uh pieces of
[36:13] fabric handkerchiefs garments amen and
[36:15] they would take them and lay them on the
[36:16] sick and the sick would recover amen so
[36:18] God wrought special Miracles by the
[36:21] hands of Paul so was it the hands of
[36:23] Paul or was it the works of God and the
[36:26] answer is yes
[36:29] praise God
[36:31] let's go to Romans chapter 7. I want to
[36:34] see something here that Paul says in
[36:36] Romans chapter 7.
[36:43] Romans chapter 7
[36:46] verse 18.
[36:49] the Apostle Paul says for I know that in
[36:53] me
[36:54] then he interjects a thought
[36:56] that is in my flesh
[36:59] dwelleth no good thing
[37:02] so the Paul has to be careful what he
[37:05] says here
[37:07] because Paul can't say that in me is no
[37:10] good thing because that would be a false
[37:12] statement
[37:13] but he says I know that in me that is in
[37:15] my flesh dwelleth no good thing now
[37:18] that's a true statement
[37:20] so Paul has to be careful how he words
[37:22] this amen just the same as we have to be
[37:25] careful how we handle this thought
[37:28] because Paul is saying that I'll read it
[37:32] verbatimian for I know that in me that
[37:34] is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[37:37] but it's not as though there's nothing
[37:39] good dwelling in Paul because Christ is
[37:41] dwelling in Paul
[37:43] so something very good is dwelling in
[37:45] Paul but in Paul's flesh is no good
[37:47] thing but in Paul is a wonderful thing
[37:50] the great thing the great one Jesus
[37:52] Christ so he had to be careful how he
[37:55] worded this if he would have left out
[37:57] that that and that that what he injected
[37:59] there and in my flesh then he would have
[38:02] made a false statement amen that would
[38:03] have planted a false thought into the
[38:05] church
[38:07] but we need to pick up this thought and
[38:09] we need to understand amen that that
[38:11] there's two sides that I see the
[38:14] Christians making errors on
[38:16] and me included there's two ways that we
[38:20] go wrong and the truth is always right
[38:21] down the middle we go wrong in feeling
[38:24] like we're nothing
[38:25] that we're absolutely nothing there's no
[38:28] good thing in me I can never overcome
[38:30] I'm worthless you make a huge mistake
[38:33] because if you're the purchase of the
[38:35] blood of Jesus Christ and Christ dwells
[38:36] in you that that statement can't stand
[38:39] that's wrong
[38:41] but then when the reality of Christ
[38:44] dwelling in you overcoming through you
[38:46] manifesting the word through you when
[38:48] that becomes attributed to your flesh
[38:51] you're also wrong
[38:52] then we become lifted up in Pride
[38:55] and then we get self-interjected and
[38:57] start to think that this is a work of
[38:58] self and it's not a work of self neither
[39:01] is it independent of self but it's God
[39:03] working through you
[39:05] both the will and to do of his good
[39:07] pleasure so I see the church going wrong
[39:10] both ways
[39:12] We Go Wrong by not realizing that you
[39:15] know in me that is in my flesh is no
[39:17] good thing there is nothing worth
[39:19] anything in the flesh of me I was born
[39:21] wrong it's hybrid it's a sticky
[39:24] conquerable nature the the way that I
[39:26] know that it's no good is that even
[39:28] though Christ lives inside of this body
[39:30] this body still has to be made over into
[39:33] a glorified form
[39:35] so I know I can put no stock in this
[39:38] it's still got a sticky cucumber nature
[39:40] to it and my human spirit amen is a
[39:43] spirit of the earth a carnal spirit amen
[39:45] that at my departure from this body will
[39:47] go and be no more amen so I had to have
[39:50] a Holy Spirit come in to give me
[39:52] leadership
[39:55] all right
[39:56] so this line gets cut pretty tight
[40:00] so I know that in me that is in my flesh
[40:03] is no good thing but I know that In Me
[40:05] Is a Good Thing If Christ be in me
[40:08] [Music]
[40:10] oh we have to be careful
[40:13] at the same time brother Branham said
[40:15] man is a walking paradox
[40:18] at the same exact moment you are
[40:21] worthless helpless no good and a failure
[40:23] to begin with
[40:24] and at the exact same time you were the
[40:27] Bride of Jesus Christ amen the
[40:29] manifestation of the word for this hour
[40:32] that is undefeatable indestructible
[40:37] at the same time
[40:40] and it's the way we keep our attitude
[40:42] about this
[40:43] that'll keep things in the right Channel
[40:46] but when we slip to one side or the
[40:48] other we're going to get out of the
[40:50] channel in the flow of the word will
[40:52] stop flowing in our lives
[40:54] so when we start to uh have an
[40:57] overestimated value of ourself of our
[41:00] flesh man that let's say outer man inner
[41:02] man because the outer Ram consists of
[41:04] the flesh body and the human spirit
[41:07] the inner man amen is is is the soul
[41:11] that has been quickened by the baptism
[41:12] of the Holy Ghost
[41:14] so we have to understand that we are a
[41:18] paradox
[41:20] and that we really are two persons at
[41:22] the same time
[41:24] and we have to put no confidence in the
[41:26] flesh that's why sometimes we we see
[41:29] that that things go awry when we fail to
[41:34] recognize that even my human spirit is
[41:36] still falling so every thought that
[41:39] comes through my mind and every emotion
[41:40] I have about something is not the holy
[41:43] spirit is not God
[41:45] so every tingly sensation I have in
[41:48] every feeling that I have may or may not
[41:50] be God I must still judge it by the word
[41:54] because I still have an outer man that
[41:56] is wrong and can lead me astray I have
[41:59] not so arrived that I can trust my flesh
[42:04] and that's where I see so many people
[42:06] going wrong amen they they walk with God
[42:08] they realize they're the bride and they
[42:10] think every thought that passes through
[42:12] their mind and every feeling they have
[42:13] is God is equal to thus saith the Lord
[42:16] and it goes Haywire
[42:18] amen because we're still in flesh
[42:23] but within this Tabernacle the inner man
[42:27] amen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:29] Christ is dwelling in there manifesting
[42:31] his word amen and the only way to
[42:34] distinguish between the two is the word
[42:37] we must stay planted in the word and
[42:40] judging by the word and never trust
[42:42] ourselves and never doubt who's in US
[42:46] we can never trust ourselves but we can
[42:50] never doubt Who We Are
[42:52] you talk about walking a tightrope
[42:56] we have to walk the tightrope
[42:58] because the deny Christ and bride form
[43:01] is to deny the word for your age
[43:05] but to not to fail to recognize the
[43:08] trappings of the outer man is to set
[43:10] ourselves up for failure
[43:13] we're going to be off in the weeds often
[43:15] the fanaticism and some craziness
[43:17] if we don't keep this balance
[43:19] so my brother remember said the truth is
[43:21] always right down the middle
[43:23] the problem is we always think we're in
[43:25] the middle
[43:27] we can be on way one way one side or the
[43:30] other and we always think that we're in
[43:32] the middle but by the by by the grace of
[43:34] God we've got a message that we just
[43:36] keep listening and keep yielding and
[43:38] keep humble to the voice God's given us
[43:40] to the word of this hour it'll keep
[43:42] bringing us back to the middle
[43:45] amen so Paul says that I know that in me
[43:50] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[43:52] thing that's why we said Sunday brother
[43:55] brim said that uh William Branham is the
[43:58] greatest enemy I got
[44:01] but he's also the prophet of the age
[44:06] he's gone
[44:08] so is he a good guy or a bad guy
[44:11] the answer is yes
[44:14] depends on which side we're looking at
[44:17] in first John chapter 4.
[44:21] we want to look at this scripture
[44:31] first John chapter 4
[44:34] this is why
[44:36] I I this is just me this is just a
[44:39] thought that I have and it could be a
[44:40] million miles from right but you see
[44:42] that it looked as though that that God
[44:45] took brother Branham prematurely but we
[44:47] know there's nothing premature in the
[44:49] plan of God
[44:50] and he was taken at the age I believe it
[44:52] was 56 when he died and he was really in
[44:56] the prime of his preaching remember I
[44:57] said when I was first started I was like
[44:59] a little boy splashing in the water
[45:01] couldn't really swim but I learned how
[45:02] to take those strokes and he was really
[45:04] operating in his gift and he really
[45:06] coming to uh adoption so I I believe
[45:09] he's coming to adoption God can trust
[45:12] him with the word amen and he and he's
[45:14] moving into the uh preaching the the
[45:17] real meat of the Bride Ministry and and
[45:21] it looks like God just snatched him away
[45:23] amen but you realize that he was
[45:25] dwelling in flesh if God were to let him
[45:29] go on 20 or 25 years and and sinality
[45:32] began to creep in and he began to lose
[45:34] his mind and dementia creeped in and you
[45:37] know people regarding him as a prophet
[45:39] if dementia would have creeped in and he
[45:41] started saying odd things in the Pulpit
[45:42] what would have happened
[45:47] God took him exactly right on time
[45:50] God knows exactly what he's doing
[45:52] because he lived in a body of Flesh
[45:55] I mean the prophets of old
[45:57] they would at the end of their life they
[45:59] couldn't even see anymore they were
[46:00] blind
[46:02] they were laying in bed they had the the
[46:04] to pull their feet out of bed to lay
[46:06] their hands on their grandchildren to
[46:08] bless them amen and and they sometimes
[46:10] you know Isaac didn't know if it was
[46:13] Esau I didn't know it was Jacob because
[46:14] he was blind
[46:16] this is life
[46:18] this is the flesh we dwell in
[46:21] we have to recognize that that no matter
[46:23] how wonderful we are
[46:26] no matter how much God uses a gift in
[46:29] our lives how much God uses us we're
[46:31] still in flesh
[46:32] this flesh is corrupted and corruptable
[46:35] and will deteriorate and become weak
[46:39] amen
[46:41] prone to failure
[46:43] and we have to always remember that
[46:46] the most gifted Among Us can fail
[46:50] it's important to remember that
[46:52] that there's a human side and there's a
[46:55] God's side
[46:57] and and we have to be careful with one
[47:00] another that we keep it that way
[47:03] that there's a human side and there's a
[47:05] God side to one another
[47:07] so we can't discount the god in one
[47:09] another neither can we Overlook the
[47:11] humanity of one another
[47:15] I think this is maturity in the bride to
[47:18] understand that these elements are
[47:19] always here
[47:22] praise God first John 4 4.
[47:26] he says
[47:27] year of God little children and have
[47:30] overcome them because greater is he that
[47:33] is in you
[47:34] than he that is in the world
[47:37] amen
[47:39] we just read where Paul says I know that
[47:42] in me
[47:46] John says greater is he that's in you
[47:48] than he that's in the world so the he
[47:50] that's in you is not in your flesh
[47:54] the he that's in you is in your soul
[47:57] amen
[47:58] brother Ben says in the message he says
[48:01] did you know a man's worth only 84 cents
[48:04] in chemicals now we've had some
[48:06] inflation since since 1955.
[48:09] so I mean we might be up to 15 bucks 20
[48:12] 25 I don't know what I don't know what
[48:14] 84 cents from then to now but it can't
[48:18] be a whole lot 20 Bill might do it
[48:22] did you know a man's worth only 84 cents
[48:24] in chemicals
[48:26] just enough chemicals about him a little
[48:29] bit of calcium just enough white wash to
[48:31] sprinkle the Hen's Nest
[48:34] and you know just a few chemicals and
[48:36] then you walk around like you're worth a
[48:38] hundred million dollars and what are you
[48:40] anyhow that's what any of us is after a
[48:44] while we're going to lay out there in
[48:45] the graveyard and rot away but that soul
[48:48] brother that's in there tonight in front
[48:51] of God is worth 10 million worlds
[48:54] that's right you'll take care of the 84
[48:57] cents but you'll just let anything come
[48:58] into that soul
[49:00] so brother Benham I think it's amazing
[49:02] he he starts to take a human being and
[49:06] he starts to make you worth nothing
[49:09] and worth everything in the same quote
[49:13] it just depends on the part of you we're
[49:15] talking about
[49:16] and we if we if we extracted all the
[49:19] chemicals all the mineral content out of
[49:21] your body you may only be worth 20 bucks
[49:24] some of us are bigger than others we
[49:26] might fit 25 dollars
[49:29] not worth much
[49:32] not worth the clothes you're wearing
[49:36] but down inside of that worthless
[49:40] compilation of chemicals put together by
[49:43] genetics
[49:44] is a soul and if that Soul has a sieging
[49:47] that's come from God what's the value of
[49:50] that
[49:52] if it's part of the word it is the word
[49:55] and measure it's priceless
[50:03] brother bam says in the message
[50:04] communion the last message he preaches
[50:06] he's talking about questions he used to
[50:08] ask when he was a boy and wondering
[50:10] about God but then he says what was it
[50:13] he said there was another William
[50:15] Branham
[50:16] see a little spot of eternal life down
[50:19] there
[50:20] from the genes of God the word of God
[50:22] that was placed in there what was it
[50:25] when he was a boy that was causing him
[50:27] to want God or to ask these questions he
[50:29] said there was another William Branham
[50:31] amen where down there a gene of God part
[50:34] of the word of God down in the soul amen
[50:36] the Brother Bear said the part that was
[50:38] meant to be you from the beginning
[50:40] the genuine part the part that come from
[50:43] God the thought of God Amen that now is
[50:45] implanted into your soul now birthed by
[50:48] by the new birth to bring its life in
[50:50] its own manifestation
[50:52] that is priceless
[50:57] amen amen so
[50:59] so we are a walking paradox
[51:03] praise God
[51:05] I say brother remember says what was it
[51:08] he said there was another William
[51:09] Branham down in there
[51:10] to me that's the prophet of the age
[51:15] that other William Branham that was down
[51:17] inside
[51:18] you see what I'm saying
[51:21] I started asking myself what is the
[51:24] bride
[51:25] what is the bride
[51:27] the bride we know the brother man asked
[51:30] the question what is the word bride he
[51:31] said the manifestation of the hour
[51:34] what is the bride it's the portion of
[51:36] the word that God once expressed in this
[51:38] day
[51:39] so it's a thought of God now expressed
[51:42] which is a word
[51:43] and it's the anointed we're for the day
[51:45] so it's also Christ
[51:48] but that bride is being manifest in
[51:51] human vessels
[51:53] so I believe by faith that I'm part of
[51:55] the bride and the bride is being
[51:57] manifest through my human vessel
[51:59] but then I say what part of me is bride
[52:01] well the only part of me is bright as
[52:03] the soul
[52:04] this isn't bride
[52:06] my mental realm is not bride the only
[52:09] part of me is bride is that part that
[52:11] come from God the Eternal part that's
[52:13] down inside another child lamp that may
[52:15] not even have the name Chad Lamb
[52:18] I don't even know what the name will be
[52:20] what do you call it in the Heavenly
[52:22] Realms what was it in the thoughts of
[52:23] God one it will be in the great
[52:24] Hereafter I don't know maybe it'll be
[52:26] chadland maybe it won't maybe we'll
[52:28] speak English maybe we won't
[52:30] the point is the the genuine thought of
[52:33] God concerning me amen is down in my
[52:36] soul and come alive amen by the spirit
[52:38] of God that is the bride
[52:41] that is my portion of bride that is the
[52:44] thought God had before the foundation of
[52:46] the world when he thought of me that's
[52:48] what he was thinking of Amen now that is
[52:51] contained in a vessel that come through
[52:54] sex birth through hybridization that's
[52:55] born wrong and has a carnal worldly
[52:57] spirit that part has to all change but
[53:00] until that change takes place the life
[53:03] on the inside must bring this subject to
[53:05] the word of God
[53:07] but I never must lose sight that this
[53:10] isn't bride
[53:13] or else I will start treating all of me
[53:17] as bride
[53:18] and have too much confidence
[53:21] and my emotions my thoughts my feelings
[53:24] my Sensations
[53:31] amen
[53:34] this isn't the day to be childish
[53:37] this is the age to grow up
[53:40] and have understanding
[53:42] and this message has opened the word to
[53:44] give us an understanding like no other
[53:47] age has had
[53:49] we can put no confidence in the flesh
[53:52] but I have utmost confidence in the word
[53:54] of God
[53:56] and the word of God is what he placed
[53:59] inside of me to be expressed in this
[54:01] hour and I've got absolute confidence in
[54:04] the god that's in me
[54:06] but not me
[54:08] but the god that's in me
[54:12] praise God
[54:14] let's go to John 15 the Gospel of John
[54:19] 15.
[54:25] you can walk away and we can say so
[54:27] brother Chad are we supposed to be
[54:28] confident or not confident
[54:31] are we supposed to be sure or not sure
[54:36] never ever ever ever be overconfident in
[54:40] yourself
[54:42] but never doubt what God has said about
[54:45] you
[54:47] never doubt what the word has promised
[54:50] for your life never doubt what God Said
[54:52] is about you never doubt who God has
[54:54] revealed to you personally that you are
[54:57] because if you begin to doubt that
[54:58] you'll lose hold of every promise of God
[55:00] and you'll lose your victory
[55:03] but if you start to take that and apply
[55:05] it to all the realms
[55:08] then we're gonna we're gonna set
[55:09] ourselves up for failure
[55:11] we're going to move into fanaticism and
[55:14] be led by emotions and feelings and
[55:16] we're going to train wreck ourselves and
[55:19] others too
[55:20] look at John 15 verse 4.
[55:27] Jesus says abide in me and I in you as
[55:29] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[55:30] except it abide in the vine no more can
[55:33] you accept you abide in me I am the vine
[55:35] you are the branches he that abideth in
[55:37] me and I in him the same bringeth forth
[55:39] much fruit for without me you can do
[55:43] nothing
[55:45] Hallelujah without him we can do nothing
[55:50] where is he he's in me
[55:52] so with him in me
[55:55] we can do anything
[55:56] but without him I can do nothing
[55:58] so it's not me it's him
[56:02] let's go to Matthew 19 now
[56:09] Matthew 19.
[56:12] verse 26.
[56:19] Matthew 26 or Matthew 19 26 but Jesus
[56:23] beheld them and said unto him with men
[56:25] this is impossible but With God all
[56:28] things are possible
[56:30] so without him you can do nothing with
[56:32] men it's impossible but with him with
[56:36] him With God all things are possible
[56:40] so in you all things are possible but in
[56:43] you alone nothing is possible
[56:47] amen
[56:49] we're a walking paradox
[56:52] Amen in the message Jehovah Jireh my
[56:54] brother says a man is a failure he's
[56:57] totally lost at his birth there is no
[57:00] good in man if there's anything good
[57:02] about a man it's what it's the part of
[57:04] God that's in him
[57:06] for a man in himself is totally no good
[57:08] and there is any goodness about him at
[57:10] all it's God that did it for him
[57:12] praise God
[57:14] brother Ben goes on to say in the
[57:16] unfailing realities of the Living God
[57:18] says God always likes to work through
[57:20] men it's God's program to work through
[57:22] men do you believe that God works
[57:25] through men he made man his helper on
[57:28] Earth he made man a Lesser God than
[57:30] himself
[57:32] so that's why he he makes promises in
[57:35] the church ages to him that overcome
[57:37] but how are we going to overcome it's
[57:39] him overcoming in US amen but yet we're
[57:42] we're attributed as the Overcomers
[57:45] so we become the Overcomers but we never
[57:47] overcame by ourselves it was always his
[57:50] Spirit working through us that made us
[57:52] the Overcomers
[57:53] but yet he calls us Overcomers
[57:56] why does he call us Overcomers because
[57:58] we surrendered ourselves to his spirit
[58:00] and let him take us and we believed his
[58:03] word and we believed what he said about
[58:05] us and stood on the promise we didn't
[58:07] sit and lay down and wait for God to do
[58:09] everything we got up and said if that's
[58:11] what God says that's what we'll do if
[58:13] that's what God says that's the way
[58:14] we'll believe and if he says lay hands
[58:16] on the sick we'll lay hands on the sick
[58:17] when we lay hands on the sick they're
[58:19] healed
[58:21] why because we took him on his word
[58:26] man you made man his helper on the Earth
[58:30] amen we know
[58:32] uh I'm going to read you out of Acts 7
[58:35] verse 34 we know that God works through
[58:38] manatees in partnership with men and in
[58:41] Acts 7 it says I have seen
[58:43] I have seen I have seen the Affliction
[58:45] of my people which is in Egypt and I
[58:47] have heard they're groaning and have
[58:49] come down to deliver them and now come I
[58:51] will send thee into Egypt this is God
[58:53] speaking to Moses and says I've come
[58:55] down to deliver I heard their groanings
[58:57] now come I send you
[59:00] we've talked about this so many times
[59:01] who was Moses Moses was Moses was to
[59:05] deliver but it wasn't Moses who
[59:07] delivered it was God who delivered
[59:09] but God didn't do it independent of
[59:11] Moses and Moses could have never done it
[59:13] without God
[59:15] so what's God doing in this age
[59:18] and where is he doing it
[59:20] anything that God's going to do in this
[59:22] age remember brother Benham told us that
[59:25] Christ God is now going to do work in
[59:28] and through the bride that specific work
[59:31] which he left for this day
[59:34] so there's works that he did not
[59:36] complete all his works when Christ was
[59:38] here but he left the portion of that
[59:40] work to do in and through the bride
[59:42] so if he's going to do his work among
[59:45] the Gentiles in this day where is he
[59:46] going to do it he's going to do it in
[59:48] and through the bride so whereas he's
[59:50] working he's working here
[59:51] not the flesh but him down on the inside
[59:54] through the flesh
[59:58] and I can't doubt that or else I become
[1:00:00] worthless
[1:00:01] to everybody else around me
[1:00:04] if I'm plagued by self-doubt
[1:00:07] if I'm playing you know we should have a
[1:00:09] healthy degree of self-doubt
[1:00:12] but we should have a pure Revelation a
[1:00:15] good revelation of who we are in Christ
[1:00:18] because then I can realize in a time of
[1:00:21] need in a time of trial amen there's
[1:00:24] nothing that I as a person can do for
[1:00:27] this person next to me but I know that
[1:00:29] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:00:31] that's in the world
[1:00:33] and I know who's in me and I know that
[1:00:35] he's Divine and I'm the branch and the
[1:00:37] fruit is supposed to come off the branch
[1:00:39] so I'm the branch so now I can go to
[1:00:42] this person and I can tell them there's
[1:00:44] a promise if we can believe this promise
[1:00:46] together I can lay hands on you and you
[1:00:48] can recover
[1:00:51] because God is working through a vessel
[1:00:54] what vessel
[1:00:56] if it's not you and I who is it
[1:00:59] where is it
[1:01:01] we can what's so bad for God to do
[1:01:04] something do something do something do
[1:01:06] something amen but the thing that God's
[1:01:09] going to do he's going to do that
[1:01:10] through vessels of clay
[1:01:14] brother remember says in the message the
[1:01:16] identified Christ of all ages
[1:01:19] he says so therefore
[1:01:22] he could tell the end from the beginning
[1:01:24] and in each age he lauded so much of his
[1:01:27] word in each age and then usually man
[1:01:30] gets it so twisted up and the world gets
[1:01:32] it in such a shape until he has to send
[1:01:34] some man anointed all ages has been the
[1:01:37] same he identifies himself among the
[1:01:39] Earth and man God does nothing without
[1:01:42] man
[1:01:43] the Bible said to him you know see he
[1:01:45] always takes man because it was man he
[1:01:48] had to use and and he put him on free
[1:01:50] moral agency knowing that he would fall
[1:01:52] in order to display his attributes as
[1:01:55] Savior for there was nothing lost and
[1:01:58] therefore he chose man he could have
[1:02:00] chose Stars he could have chose trees
[1:02:02] but he chose man
[1:02:06] question is today what man has he chose
[1:02:12] if it's not us who is it
[1:02:15] if it's not if he's not wanting to work
[1:02:16] in and through each one of us then where
[1:02:18] is it where is he going to work
[1:02:24] brother Graham says in the message new
[1:02:25] ministry
[1:02:27] and he's referring to the to the
[1:02:29] scripture where Jesus is standing with
[1:02:31] the disciples he's looking out over the
[1:02:33] people and he tells them to pray to the
[1:02:35] Lord of the Harvest that he will send
[1:02:36] laborers into the Harvest for the
[1:02:38] Harvest is white unto Harvest it's ready
[1:02:40] to reap
[1:02:41] and brother Bam's referring to that now
[1:02:43] he says now you say well if he knows it
[1:02:46] then why are you preaching because
[1:02:47] brother Bear's talking about
[1:02:48] predestination and God knows who will
[1:02:49] and who won't he says if if you know if
[1:02:52] God knows everything then why are you
[1:02:53] preaching
[1:02:54] and if God Saves why are you preaching
[1:02:58] you think about it why are we preaching
[1:02:59] now
[1:03:02] why why do we come to church and why do
[1:03:04] we sit and listen to preaching because
[1:03:06] this is God's method if God wants to
[1:03:08] speak he's going to speak through man
[1:03:12] and if we have confidence in God's way
[1:03:14] and can and can keep the Flesh and keep
[1:03:17] the spirit I mean the spirit of God and
[1:03:19] the Flesh of a man and keep everything
[1:03:21] lined up right with the right
[1:03:22] understanding we can come to church and
[1:03:24] get the full benefit of what God is
[1:03:26] doing
[1:03:27] yes
[1:03:28] because if we overly respect the Flesh
[1:03:30] of a man behind the pulpit we're going
[1:03:32] to go way wrong but if we devalue the
[1:03:34] gift and a brother operated by the
[1:03:36] spirit we're going to go away wrong
[1:03:38] so we've got to come right back to the
[1:03:39] truth is right down the middle
[1:03:42] so if we don't have reverence and
[1:03:43] respect we're going to miss out amen but
[1:03:45] if we have too much respect on the wrong
[1:03:47] part of a human being we're gonna we're
[1:03:49] gonna miss out
[1:03:51] we've got to come to the right
[1:03:52] understanding so why are we preaching
[1:03:54] because this is God's method
[1:03:56] the highest form of communication
[1:03:58] between God is Man is the preaching of
[1:04:00] the word
[1:04:03] but yet amen the man who's doing the
[1:04:05] preaching is no good
[1:04:08] prone to failure makes mistakes may say
[1:04:11] things wrong amen may may do things
[1:04:14] wrong amen but but but the gift inside
[1:04:17] and the word that's being preached
[1:04:18] that's God
[1:04:23] God have mercy on all of us
[1:04:25] it's just going to take God to bring us
[1:04:27] through
[1:04:28] it's just going to take the leadership
[1:04:30] of the Holy Ghost to have us come out
[1:04:32] right because there's a million ways to
[1:04:34] come out wrong
[1:04:36] we're just going to have to be
[1:04:38] completely dependent on the spirit of
[1:04:40] God to show us in the word and keep us
[1:04:42] down the middle of this road or we're
[1:04:43] going to wind up in a ditch on one side
[1:04:45] or the other
[1:04:46] because human nature will take us there
[1:04:48] so fast because this setup that God has
[1:04:51] amen is so complicated for a human mind
[1:04:53] to figure out that we're going to ditch
[1:04:55] ourselves to the right or the left if
[1:04:57] God doesn't come on the scene and lead
[1:04:58] us right through
[1:05:02] brother Benham said the reason I can
[1:05:03] help you is because you have confidence
[1:05:04] in me
[1:05:06] if you lose confidence in The Man Behind
[1:05:08] the pulpit he can't do a thing for you
[1:05:09] if you lose confidence in your pastor he
[1:05:12] can't do a thing to help you anymore
[1:05:16] that's just the way it works
[1:05:18] but you can't have too much confidence
[1:05:20] in him because if you think that man the
[1:05:22] Flesh of that man amen then if you don't
[1:05:24] have the right understanding then you're
[1:05:26] going to lift up a man and it's going to
[1:05:28] fail
[1:05:31] gotta go right down the middle
[1:05:33] and we've got to see that in one another
[1:05:35] you got to realize amen if you've got an
[1:05:38] Affliction in your body amen and you're
[1:05:40] at home you can say to your wife hey
[1:05:42] come and lay hands on me because she's
[1:05:44] got just as much right as a Believer to
[1:05:46] lay hands on you as somebody in the
[1:05:48] ministry we got to recognize this in one
[1:05:50] another
[1:05:52] and a husband and wife see each other
[1:05:53] yeah we see The Human Side
[1:05:56] we see the sticky cocoa bird if anybody
[1:05:59] knows there's a sticky cuckoo bird still
[1:06:00] left it's our spouse
[1:06:03] but yet they should also recognize
[1:06:05] there's something more than that on the
[1:06:06] inside
[1:06:08] and if we have faith in that we can
[1:06:10] Avail ourselves of that
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:16] any believer can lay hands on you you
[1:06:19] can have faith that God will honor his
[1:06:21] word
[1:06:22] man we just don't want to lose
[1:06:23] confidence in God
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] I want to I want to go back to this
[1:06:30] quote in my new ministry
[1:06:33] preaching is his program when he looked
[1:06:35] upon the apostles he looked upon the
[1:06:37] Harvest the Harvest is ripe and the
[1:06:39] laborers are few pray the Lord of the
[1:06:41] Harvest that he will send labors into
[1:06:42] the Harvest how many remember that well
[1:06:44] why would they have to pray to the Lord
[1:06:46] of the Harvest to send laborers into his
[1:06:48] Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was
[1:06:50] standing there knowing it would be done
[1:06:52] why God has so arranged him now listen
[1:06:55] to this God Is So arrange it that his
[1:06:57] program cannot move without you and I
[1:07:04] I'm going to read that again
[1:07:06] God has so arranged it that his program
[1:07:08] cannot move without you and I
[1:07:11] brother random is referring to the
[1:07:13] scripture where Jesus looks out upon the
[1:07:15] people and he tells his disciples pray
[1:07:18] to the Lord of the Harvest that he'll
[1:07:19] send laborers into the Harvest and he
[1:07:22] brother said he was the lord of the
[1:07:24] Harvest knowing that it needed to be
[1:07:25] Harvest but could not send laborers to
[1:07:27] the Harvest till they asked
[1:07:30] because God has put himself on
[1:07:32] partnership with man he needs somebody
[1:07:34] to pray
[1:07:36] I mean if you think about this we think
[1:07:39] and and we know that God knows all
[1:07:41] things is that right
[1:07:42] God knows all things God has a a an
[1:07:46] understanding of what's going on all
[1:07:47] around us but how many times do we fail
[1:07:50] Amen to get the benefit of the word
[1:07:52] because we simply don't ask he said you
[1:07:55] have not because you ask not
[1:07:57] and here he's telling the disciples
[1:07:59] please pray he's saying please pray to
[1:08:03] me
[1:08:04] so that I can send laborers into the
[1:08:07] field
[1:08:08] now you can we can try all we want to
[1:08:11] figure out how this works mechanically
[1:08:13] and why I don't know I just knew he said
[1:08:15] it and I know what the prophet said
[1:08:16] about it amen and so there's many times
[1:08:19] we need to see ourselves for who we
[1:08:22] really are and see the power that we
[1:08:24] have with God
[1:08:26] and ask
[1:08:28] God to move mountains
[1:08:31] ask God to change situations ask God to
[1:08:35] change things in the lives of our loved
[1:08:37] ones and our family and other people in
[1:08:38] the church and stop saying well God
[1:08:40] knows it'll all work out God wants us to
[1:08:43] ask according to his word to take the
[1:08:45] promises and say God please amen fulfill
[1:08:47] your word and the life of my brother and
[1:08:49] the life of my sister and my child and
[1:08:51] my wife Amen to take God out his word
[1:08:54] but pray remember the one the widow
[1:08:56] woman and the unjust judge Jesus is the
[1:08:58] one who tells the story
[1:09:01] Jesus uses her as an example to the
[1:09:04] disciples and I'm and I would say you
[1:09:06] know don't pester God don't ask more
[1:09:08] than once
[1:09:10] I mean that's just me that's my own
[1:09:12] human thinking
[1:09:13] God knows just say it once and move on
[1:09:15] and there's times you just lay your
[1:09:17] claim to the promise and move on we
[1:09:18] understand that that God Jesus points
[1:09:21] out this woman who goes and knocks on
[1:09:23] the door of the unjust judge and
[1:09:25] continues to knock and continues to
[1:09:27] knock and he finally says not because I
[1:09:29] Fear God or I fear of man but because
[1:09:31] this Widow troubleth me I will deliver
[1:09:33] her
[1:09:35] amen and Jesus uses her as an example to
[1:09:39] the disciples
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:43] so are we supposed to trouble God
[1:09:46] I think maybe we're supposed to believe
[1:09:47] his word so much that we don't give up
[1:09:49] on it that we've got such confidence and
[1:09:52] that we know where the door is and we
[1:09:54] know who the judge is and we know where
[1:09:56] to knock amen so many people don't know
[1:09:58] where to knock they don't know who the
[1:10:00] judge is they don't know where he's
[1:10:02] located and they don't know what the
[1:10:03] promise is
[1:10:05] but we know what the word says we know
[1:10:08] what the law says for us and that we
[1:10:10] have certain rights amen and we want to
[1:10:12] see those rights fulfilled and the word
[1:10:15] manifest and we cannot and keep knocking
[1:10:17] and keep knocking and keep knocking
[1:10:20] remember where the scripture says knock
[1:10:22] and the door shall be opened brother
[1:10:24] Branham says knock is not one time but
[1:10:27] continually knocking till the door opens
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:34] I think sometimes we we may get a little
[1:10:37] lazy
[1:10:40] we may get a little lazy
[1:10:42] and we may we may we may put too much on
[1:10:46] God
[1:10:47] say brother Chad what do you say just
[1:10:49] just think with me for a minute
[1:10:51] we may be putting on God our part
[1:10:56] the part he wants us to play
[1:11:00] you can say God save my love and say
[1:11:02] this one save this one send somebody to
[1:11:04] him but maybe you're the one who's
[1:11:05] supposed to talk to them
[1:11:07] maybe it's your testimony maybe it's
[1:11:09] your preaching maybe it's
[1:11:13] I I don't I don't think we're going to
[1:11:16] get anywhere if we're putting on God our
[1:11:18] part because we're in Partnership
[1:11:19] together
[1:11:23] it's like saying God drive out the
[1:11:25] inhabitants of the land he said he would
[1:11:28] but you better take a sword in your hand
[1:11:30] and go
[1:11:32] and if you don't drive them out they'll
[1:11:34] become thorns
[1:11:38] it's like saying God keep your promise
[1:11:40] Moses praying God keep your promise to
[1:11:42] deliver the children of Israel out of
[1:11:44] bondage keep your promise to bring them
[1:11:45] to a problem keep your promise keep your
[1:11:47] promise keep your promise and when God
[1:11:49] comes to him and says hey I want you to
[1:11:51] go down and deliver him he says no I
[1:11:53] can't do that they won't listen to me
[1:11:55] foreign
[1:11:57] he goes and then God tells him again and
[1:12:00] he says but but here's a sign here's two
[1:12:02] signs and he says but they won't listen
[1:12:03] to me and then he says I'm not clear of
[1:12:05] speech and God says who made the tongue
[1:12:07] Dumber who made the ear death and he's
[1:12:10] going back and forth to God and finally
[1:12:11] he says God sends somebody else and God
[1:12:13] gets angry with him
[1:12:15] why because Moses is the chosen vessel
[1:12:18] and God has has bound himself to flesh
[1:12:22] to accomplish his will
[1:12:26] it doesn't matter how much Moses is
[1:12:28] praying God sends somebody God sends
[1:12:30] somebody Moses is to somebody
[1:12:32] and maybe you and I are the somebody
[1:12:37] I don't want to constantly put on God
[1:12:40] what's my part
[1:12:42] I want to do my part
[1:12:46] I want to finish this quote I haven't
[1:12:47] finished it yet
[1:12:48] God Is So arranged that his program
[1:12:50] cannot move without you and I
[1:12:53] you know how many times that we get our
[1:12:55] feelings hurt and get disappointed by
[1:12:56] some things in life and we just take a
[1:12:58] break
[1:13:00] has anybody ever took a Christian break
[1:13:03] you don't go into sin you don't slip
[1:13:06] into sinful life you don't you don't
[1:13:08] backslide that way but you just you're
[1:13:10] not engaged anymore
[1:13:12] you're not engaged you're not you're not
[1:13:15] working with the body you're not labor
[1:13:17] you're not putting your shoulder to the
[1:13:18] wheel I got my feelings hurt I had some
[1:13:20] things go bad and I'm just taking a
[1:13:22] break
[1:13:25] but if we're taking a break
[1:13:27] is the things God wants to do through us
[1:13:29] getting done
[1:13:32] he says God is so arranged that this
[1:13:33] program cannot move without you and I
[1:13:35] and as long as we're not doing what God
[1:13:37] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:13:40] program
[1:13:41] a strong language
[1:13:43] and when the church moves by the
[1:13:45] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're
[1:13:47] in God's will doing his program
[1:13:50] say God help me to do my part
[1:13:55] help me to pray help me to stand on the
[1:13:58] word help me to keep engaging the way
[1:14:00] I'm supposed to be engaging this world
[1:14:03] God never called us to communal living
[1:14:05] to go move to Montana and just love each
[1:14:08] other
[1:14:09] he's called us to be lights in this
[1:14:11] world and to do something
[1:14:13] to manifest the bride the bride and
[1:14:16] flesh amen through our flesh he wants to
[1:14:20] manifest himself he said God help me to
[1:14:22] do my part
[1:14:25] Rim said in the unveiling of god notice
[1:14:28] when you become part of him as you are
[1:14:30] the veil that veils him you are part of
[1:14:32] him as long as Christ is in you as
[1:14:34] Christ was of God
[1:14:36] you know I referring now before I finish
[1:14:39] this quote referring to the previous
[1:14:41] quote
[1:14:42] goddess who arrange that his program
[1:14:44] cannot move without you and I and as
[1:14:45] long as we're not doing what God leads
[1:14:48] us to do we're paralyzing his program
[1:14:49] remember the message standing in the Gap
[1:14:52] when brother Brennan was corrected
[1:14:53] because he wanted to go away get away
[1:14:55] from the people his feelings were hurt
[1:14:56] all of those things Brethren made a
[1:14:59] statement in that he said I let the sick
[1:15:01] people lay
[1:15:03] do you remember that statement I let the
[1:15:05] sick people lay brother Ben did not want
[1:15:07] to go back out there and engage where he
[1:15:10] was getting rejected and where he was
[1:15:11] getting his feelings hurt
[1:15:14] right he said I built myself up a
[1:15:16] complex because they didn't hear the
[1:15:18] message
[1:15:19] they didn't hear my message
[1:15:21] but he makes a statement I let the sick
[1:15:22] people lay
[1:15:25] he had a gift of healing that was given
[1:15:28] to him and the commission to use that
[1:15:30] was given by an Angel and that gift
[1:15:33] wasn't going to go away but that gift
[1:15:34] was also with him
[1:15:37] and as long as he wasn't going out in
[1:15:39] the ministry there was many people who
[1:15:42] weren't getting healed
[1:15:44] and we could think well God could heal
[1:15:45] whoever he wants but God God put a gift
[1:15:48] in that man of healing and when he would
[1:15:51] go out that gift would operate and the
[1:15:53] many people would be healed and when he
[1:15:55] wasn't going people were not getting
[1:15:57] healed
[1:16:00] think about how profound that is
[1:16:03] God can do anything he wants he can heal
[1:16:04] anybody he wants but God has a chosen
[1:16:07] method to operate he's going to operate
[1:16:08] through man and he placed this great
[1:16:10] gift of healing in this vessel and when
[1:16:12] this vessel got his feelings hurt and
[1:16:15] didn't want to go back out there where
[1:16:16] he could get his feelings hurt he let
[1:16:18] the sick people lay there was people who
[1:16:20] were not getting healed because he was
[1:16:22] nursing her feelings
[1:16:26] I said God help every one of us
[1:16:28] help every one of us
[1:16:31] to take our part
[1:16:33] and not back down
[1:16:35] and say God
[1:16:37] help me Lord help me to surrender this
[1:16:40] flesh and this body to your will
[1:16:43] help me God I don't want to paralyze
[1:16:46] your program I want to see your program
[1:16:48] moving forward
[1:16:49] I want to be engaging I want to be
[1:16:51] testifying I want to be in prayer
[1:16:53] whatever you show me to do whatever I
[1:16:55] see to do I want to do it with all my
[1:16:57] heart
[1:16:58] amen because the battle is the Lord's
[1:17:02] but somebody's got to throw the Rock
[1:17:06] the battle is the Lord's
[1:17:09] but somebody's got to take a sword and
[1:17:11] step on the promise
[1:17:14] he'll drive the mouth but somebody's got
[1:17:17] to move forward
[1:17:18] because if somebody's not moving forward
[1:17:20] nobody's getting driven out
[1:17:22] help us to move forward God
[1:17:24] now back in this quote an unveiling of
[1:17:26] God he says now because God was in him
[1:17:29] made him God and as Christ is in you the
[1:17:31] hope of glory you become part of Christ
[1:17:34] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:17:36] do shall he also see you become part of
[1:17:38] Christ as long as Christ is hidden you
[1:17:40] then it's veiled to the unbeliever but
[1:17:44] you know he's in you you are templing
[1:17:47] Christ that's behind the veil the skin
[1:17:51] where is Christ he's behind the veil
[1:17:55] what Veil the veil of Flesh what flesh
[1:17:59] the many membered body
[1:18:01] the bride
[1:18:04] when we walk into work and we walk into
[1:18:06] family reunions we walk into stores
[1:18:09] there's a veil
[1:18:10] but there's something behind the veil
[1:18:13] wherever we go we need to remember that
[1:18:17] every every place we go endless
[1:18:20] possibilities are there
[1:18:24] the supernatural realm is there the
[1:18:26] possibility for Supernatural is there
[1:18:29] because we are templing Christ who's
[1:18:31] behind the veil
[1:18:33] I can do nothing but greater is he
[1:18:36] that's in me that's even in the world
[1:18:37] Amen he is the vine I'm the breath I can
[1:18:41] do nothing but if the if the vine is
[1:18:43] living in me amen then all things are
[1:18:45] possible
[1:18:48] so where's Christ Christ is in thousands
[1:18:51] of places
[1:18:53] around this world
[1:18:54] he's an ex he's accessible to millions
[1:18:58] of people
[1:19:00] I don't want to take away somebody's
[1:19:02] access
[1:19:04] I want to stay accessory
[1:19:07] I want to have enough doubt in my flesh
[1:19:10] not to lean to flesh and enough faith in
[1:19:12] the Christ in me to stay in my position
[1:19:16] and stay a light in a dark place
[1:19:19] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:19:21] he that's in the world I want to have
[1:19:23] enough confidence in what who God said I
[1:19:26] am and the life of Christ in me I want
[1:19:28] to have enough confidence in that to do
[1:19:30] the thing
[1:19:31] you do
[1:19:32] and not lose confidence because all I
[1:19:34] can see is the Flesh and not see Christ
[1:19:35] to where I'm I'm I've been made
[1:19:37] ineffective
[1:19:39] but I want to stay right down the middle
[1:19:40] of the road
[1:19:42] and I want to have faith in who I am and
[1:19:44] I want to doubt the flesh that I live in
[1:19:46] I want to put no confidence in the honor
[1:19:48] man but I want to put all confidence in
[1:19:50] Christ who lives in the Inner Man
[1:19:53] to Fine Line friends
[1:19:56] I want to read one last scripture and
[1:19:58] we'll close with this second Corinthians
[1:20:00] chapter six
[1:20:06] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:20:23] second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16.
[1:20:28] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:20:30] God with idols for ye are the Temple of
[1:20:34] the Living God
[1:20:36] and God has said I will dwell in them
[1:20:39] and walk in them
[1:20:43] is God walking in the Earth
[1:20:45] yes
[1:20:47] where is he walking the Earth and
[1:20:49] whoever these people are he's referring
[1:20:51] to
[1:20:53] you I will dwell in them and walk in
[1:20:55] them and I will be their God and they
[1:20:58] shall be my people
[1:21:01] and God is on partnership with these
[1:21:04] people
[1:21:05] and he's working through these people
[1:21:07] and he's walking in these people
[1:21:11] praise God let's all stand
[1:21:13] musicians if you please come
[1:21:17] amen

[1:21:21] together

[1:21:25] for your word
[1:21:27] and God made me walk out of here warned
[1:21:30] and encouraged
[1:21:32] Lord warned that we live in a flesh Lord
[1:21:35] that is susceptible to Rome that is of a
[1:21:39] fallen nature an outer man that must be
[1:21:41] yet changed
[1:21:43] but God maybe also walk out of here
[1:21:45] encouraged and confident
[1:21:47] that greater is you that's in us than he
[1:21:49] that's in the world
[1:21:51] God may we walk in this life mature with
[1:21:54] mature understanding
[1:21:56] may we walk Lord in a way that allows
[1:22:00] you to work through this flesh For Your
[1:22:02] Glory may you accomplish what you left
[1:22:04] for this end time to be done in and
[1:22:07] through us as individuals may we have
[1:22:09] confidence in the promise Lord for this
[1:22:11] hour and who we are in that promise may
[1:22:15] we stay engaging and bring a light and a
[1:22:17] word to people who are in darkness
[1:22:19] may you use our hands may use our mouth
[1:22:22] use our feet use our eyes use us Lord
[1:22:26] now may we yield ourselves to you and
[1:22:28] have confidence in you

[1:23:11] word for the light of this hour

[1:23:17] your word

[1:25:59] yeah he is ours in all to me
[1:26:06] amen I wanted to share something with
[1:26:08] you before we finish tonight I got a
[1:26:12] call from Levi Yoder uh or you know many
[1:26:15] of you know Levi you know I think almost
[1:26:16] all of you do and he's been witnessing
[1:26:18] he's been doing a good job of getting
[1:26:20] the word out but he's got some people
[1:26:22] who are interested in water baptism and
[1:26:24] he set up a meeting for us this Friday
[1:26:26] so pray please pray for me I'll be
[1:26:29] heading out to Holmes County amen this
[1:26:34] Friday I've got a service at 5 30 P.M
[1:26:37] uh and we're going to be preaching on
[1:26:39] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ and there's one uh ex-omish man a
[1:26:44] man has already left Amish Church who
[1:26:45] wants to be baptized so I know we have
[1:26:47] at least one to baptize after that
[1:26:49] service and after the service who knows
[1:26:51] there may be more this man's invited his
[1:26:53] family Levi's invited others there's
[1:26:56] going to be a few there at least I don't
[1:26:58] know how many but I would really
[1:26:59] appreciate your prayers if you'll be
[1:27:01] praying about that God's light will
[1:27:04] strike his seed that God's word will go
[1:27:07] forth in truth and you know there
[1:27:11] the number of bride left on the earth
[1:27:13] may be few
[1:27:15] we may find one praise God if we do may
[1:27:18] find several praise God if we do
[1:27:21] but you know there's even a reward for
[1:27:23] those who can honor and respect the word
[1:27:24] of God when they hear it so maybe even
[1:27:27] others may even come to the truth of
[1:27:28] water baptism and they may not be able
[1:27:30] to go further but praise God if they can
[1:27:32] honor God's word God will honor those
[1:27:34] who honor him
[1:27:36] so just pray that the word will have an
[1:27:38] effect on all that hearing amen and
[1:27:42] we'll do the very best we can and
[1:27:43] hopefully Sunday will be able to give
[1:27:46] you a report back on that but that'll be
[1:27:48] this Friday at 5 30 over in Holmes
