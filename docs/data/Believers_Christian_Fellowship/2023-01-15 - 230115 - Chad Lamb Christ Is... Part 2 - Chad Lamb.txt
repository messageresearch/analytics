========================================

Nicodemus saying unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee accept a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee thou must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou Hearst the sound thereof but cast not tell whence it come and whether it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit the spiritual birth is invisible it doesn't work like the physical birth and he says You must be born again and Nicodemus said he says how can a man when he's old be born again in through the second time in his mother's womb he says no be born of the spirit and it's like the wind the wind comes from somewhere and it goes somewhere you have no idea where it started and where it ended and you try to go go ask a meteorologist to tell you the starting point of wind on the earth and the ending point that wind started here on the map and it ended here on the map it works totally different than anything we understand I I don't know how it started I don't know where it ended but one thing we know is that when it blows through the tree I see the effect of it I see that the wind and you can say there is the wind you're not seeing the wind you're seeing the effect of the Wind and the effect of the wind lets you know that's where the wind is so he says so is everybody that's born of the spirit he that's born of the spirit you don't know where he came from you're not seeing where he's going because his life didn't start on this Earth his life started before and will continue beyond but what you're seeing in the spiritual birth amen is the birth has come to him amen and quickened the seed the part of him that was meant to be him from the beginning has come to life by coming encounter with the word for his day and now that part has started somewhere before and when it's like the wind and you can't see where a man starts and where he finishes but you can see the rustled of the leaves and say that's the wind right there and you can see the life that a person lives and say that's Jesus Christ in my brother and my sister
