[0:00] The question is what do we want out of
[0:01] life? Do we want an easy life or do we
[0:04] want to come to adoption
[0:06] maturity? It's going to take patience.
[0:10] This word patience I told you earlier it
[0:12] means steadfastness, constancy,
[0:15] endurance. Another definition is a
[0:17] patient enduring, a sustaining, a
[0:20] perseverance.
[0:22] He says, "Count it all joy when you fall
[0:25] into diverse temptations, knowing this,
[0:27] that the try of your faith workketh
[0:29] patience." So Jesus told his disciples,
[0:32] "All of these things are going to happen
[0:34] to you, but he that endureth to the end
[0:37] shall be saved." So what's it going to
[0:40] take to make it to the goal? It's going
[0:42] to take
[0:43] endurance. So why should we count it all
[0:46] joy when we fall into diverse
[0:47] temptations? Because the trying of our
[0:50] faith workketh endurance. How do we get
[0:52] endurance? By the trying of our faith.
[0:55] It teaches us to be patient, to endure,
[0:58] to just stay fast. Because Amen. It's
[1:00] all God working something in my life.
[1:03] We'll get through this, too. Amen. Amen.
[1:05] And when the next one comes, we'll get
[1:06] through this, too. Amen. I'm not
[1:08] derailed because there's trouble about
[1:10] I'm not derailed because of rejection or
[1:12] sickness. I'm not derailed because of
[1:14] falling away. I'm I'm not derailed by
[1:16] all of that. But let me set my face on
[1:18] the joy that lays ahead. This will end
[1:20] too. But let me count this all joy
[1:23] because this is going to bring about the
[1:25] patience that I need to be saved because
[1:27] he that endured to the end will be
[1:28] saved. Amen. And we're not going to make
[1:31] it without endurance, without patience.
[1:33] And we're not going to get patience
[1:35] without trials
[1:38] because the trying of our faith.
[1:41] So
[1:42] maybe rather than to despair every time
[1:45] something should happen, maybe we should
[1:47] say, "Praise your name, Lord Jesus.
[1:49] You're working something out of my
[1:51] life." Maybe the next time our heart is
[1:54] broken because of something somebody
[1:56] said to us or a circumstance that
[1:58] happened in family or happened in church
[2:00] or maybe we should just go, Amen. just
[2:03] like Paul in stalks beaten and naked in
[2:05] a prison cell and just start singing
[2:07] praises to God because he's good anyhow
[2:09] and this thing will work together for
[2:11] good because it's a promise in the
[2:12] scriptures.
[2:14] Maybe we could just change our attitude
[2:16] about troubles and disagreement and
[2:19] strife and sickness and trials and
[2:22] falling away and false brethren and
[2:24] false doctrine. If we could just change
[2:25] our attitude, maybe all of a sudden we
[2:28] would realize there's nothing to worry
[2:29] about because the destiny is still
[2:32] secure. What is that to thee? Follow
[2:34] thou me. You say, "Didn't you hear what
[2:37] they're preaching over in so- and so
[2:38] city? What's that to thee? Follow thou
[2:41] me." Didn't you hear there was a bunch
[2:42] of people that fell away because of a
[2:44] new internet site? What's that to thee?
[2:47] Follow thou me. Do you see that there's
[2:49] people bowing down and lighting candles
[2:51] and worshiping William Brandon? What's
[2:52] that to thee? Follow thou me.
[2:56] It's nothing unusual in the scriptures.
[2:58] It's nothing out of the ordinary.
[3:00] Wherever Christ was, there's always been
[3:02] a big bunch of noise.
[3:04] What does he want me to do?
[3:07] Look to the glory that lays ahead
[3:10] and endure.
