and now he comes down to verse 30 he said i can of mine own self do nothing listen friends what an example for us amen yes we are the bride yes it is jesus christ yes you are the word but you cannot act independently of the male amen you cannot go off on your own you cannot make up your own way you can't go by your own feelings you can't you have to stay tied to the male because your expression is not male your expression is female this is the hour for total surrender total submission and then total patience and waiting on god because without him we can do nothing he's the vine we're the branches amen the vine the the vine has come back amen the word has come back the male has come back to produce life but i cannot act independent of that god has taken the two and put them back together to reproduce the son of man again but i can't do it without him i in myself though in me down in my soul is a portion of god himself i cannot do it independently of the rest of the portion of god god has set it up to where these expressions must now come together to bring forth life the female expression independent of the male will bring death amen like it did in the garden amen and the male must have the female expression to bring forth life because that's the way god set it up amen god amen wanted a male expression and a female expression and here in the end time because there was a prophet here to unite the two the two have come together to produce life amen to be fruit on the vine again to be the very life of jesus christ on display in the formation of the bride but we have to stay true to our position just like just as much as jesus stayed true to his position
