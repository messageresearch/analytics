bless you sir man some familiar faces here amen I'd like to speak tonight on carrying the promise and I want to take a reading here from in my subtitle is the battle within so I'd like to take the reading here from 1st Samuel 18 verse 5- 16 and forgive me I might have to take a few drinks tonight um the devil's been attacking my throat and in preparation for this week so we're just relying on the Lord because when when the devil gets nervous I get excited amen 1st Samuel 18 verse 5-6 we're going to pick up here kind of in the middle of the story of David and David went out withs soever Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and Saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants and it came to pass as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of music and the women answered one another as they played and said Saul hath slain his thousands and David his 10 thousands and Saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto David 10 thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands what can he have more but the kingdom and sa I David from that day forward this is kind of the beginning and Saul was already in the dissension from um being rejected of the Lord but now the problems began to manifest themselves within his uh his cabinet or his his uh Kingdom and it came to pass on the tomorrow that the evil spirit from God Came Upon Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and David played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in Saul's hand and Saul cast the javelin for he said I will Smite David even to the wall with it and David avoided out of his presence twice and Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him and was departed from Saul therefore Saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people and David behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the Lord was with him wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him but all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before them let's just bow our heads tonight Lord Jesus we ask you to come and speak to us Lord may we just relax in your presence tonight and father just pull up our chairs and Tuck our feet under the table Lord Jesus and feast on your word Lord may may there be no insertion of a man's opinion but just everything from straight from your word Lord Jesus and father we know to begin with you said it's the foolishness of preaching but you gave a promise father that this the five-fold ministry was for the edifying of the body of Christ that Lord it is for the Perfection and what Lord we're looking for that perfection in our lives Lord Jesus I pray you just come tonight and speak to our hearts Lord may you move aside the veil of our of our own selves that we could see inside of us Lord and father may you just draw us nearer to you tonight we love you Lord and we thank you for all these things things in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated amen praise the Lord so thank you brother Chad you were making me nervous I appreciate his policy of sitting in the congregation amen so you know David here is is uh in a unique position and you can go through and and and you know maybe this is a good homework for the rest of the week but go back and read the whole story of David and you know in history I'm not I'm not exactly a um a historian or or know all the history but history in general when you have something like this happened in the Kingdom either David kills Saul and takes over or Saul kills David and that's the end of it and um there's a an uprising in his kingdom yet but David was protected of God so Saul could never get his hands on him and David had the utmost respect for the fact that Saul was God's anointed king that he never moved his hand against him so they played this cat and mouse game for several years um in this time and and you would think that at some point Saul would would give up and and you know manage his kingdom uh like he should but he would go to war and then as soon as the war was done he would go back to hunting David down and try try to catch him and so if if you think about just a very unique uh situation but at the same time for for David I mean absolute torent torment I mean you you think you have trials um I don't think we're being hunted by the king that's right everywhere we go and you you have to remember that that in once Israel enters this uh position of having Kings um this is this is this is uh the Pastoral ship of Israel all through the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and through the book of kings and so I I don't want you to think of who is Saul you can laugh I want you to think I wanted to put yourself in the position of David so we're not here to point and say that person is is this bad person in this story we're here to say this is me this is where I'm at or or this is the position that I'm in and Lord give me the strength and give me the courage to carry out what you have put forth in my life and it's to be an encouragement and so our title again tonight is carrying the promise and talking about the Battle within and so we can all go directly to to think about Mary right Mary was carrying the promised child within her and each of us are carrying a promise as well a promise of of the word and and there there's one goal you have to remember that the whole thing is about Redemption and Redemption is about buying back what was always his so sometimes we we come to these battles like David we have the promise but there was something in Job that God wanted to see further perfected and there's many things in you and I that God wants to see further perfected but the whole time we're carrying the promise the whole time David was carrying the promise the prophet Samuel had found him and anointed him king that's right long before he was ever in the courts of Saul and so David no doubt many times thought he was he was now moving into this position and Saul was going to recognize that he was a much better choice than his own son and and and Elevate him through the courts and and make him the king yet instead of that from from very the very beginning pretty much Saul finds a bitterness in his heart towards David but the whole time David was carrying this promise that he was the anointed king yeah so during this time of David's life there was a great battle within himself and you and I every day of our life there was a great battle within ourselves there's a great war and and and many times it puts on the face of but God you said Lord you said Lord you promised and it puts on that face not the Battle of trying to be a good Christian but the Battle of trying to to to hold to the promise the Battle of of holding to the standard that he has placed in your life he has called us all to something and it may look different for each one of us but we have all been called to an ultimate thing which is to reveal Christ to this world he has veiled himself in you and I we are the word made flesh for this generation so you are carrying the promise you have Christ within you and God wants to manifest himself through you that's right but there's the flesh that's so there's a great battle within that's right and let's jump forward to first uh Samuel 27 1st Samuel 27 and we're going to read verse 1 to 7 and David said in his heart I shall now perish One Day by the hand of Saul there is nothing better for me than than that I should speedily Escape into the land of the Philistines and Saul shall despair of me to seek me anymore in any coast of Israel so shall I escape ese out of his hand and David arose and he passed over with the 600 men that were with him into unto Ashish the son of mayo king of gath and David dwelt with Ashish at gath he and his men every man with his household even David with his two wives Ain the jezus and Abigail the caritis nabal's wife and it was told Saul that David was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him and David said unto Ashish if I have now found Grace in Thine Eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that I may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the Royal City with thee then Ashish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day and the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months so you know I I I'm in studying this out and and and and the inspiration you know one day was one thing and then the inspiration the next day was was not there and then and then it returned with vengeance and and so I really don't have much of an idea of the overall direction this is is going to go tonight but but I'm just leaning on the Lord because um he's all I care about and what he wants so you have to remember now if you were in the Kingdom of Saul I want you to put on your you know your imagination um kids you're right there with me adults maybe it's been a while but put on your your imagin ation and think about if you were part of of the Kingdom of Israel and Saul was your king and you didn't personally personally know David who would you believe you would probably believe Saul because there there's there's parts of the scriptures when they have to go and they free uh they rescue their their their wives and their children from ziklag when it's taken over by the amalekites and it says there was Men of bile with David that said we don't want to share the spoils with those who stayed behind so they weren't all good guys it was a it was a group of people who who didn't fit in and and some of them were it's old debts and they were running from their debts so it was it was this I mean first of all you're Saul and you're a pastor of a kingdom Imagine David being a pastor of that group of men and so if you were in the Kingdom of Saul though you look and you say well we we thought David was was great we thought David was great he he did all this and and he you know he was going out and he was coming in and so each of them were probably fighting with well what's the truth because now Saul our King is is trying to kill David and and then he's the he's their pastor and and we don't really know David and now David has all of these men surrounding him so what do I believe and there was probably some a lot of discussions around the dinner table and a lot of heated discussions when there was fellowships and and and different things and people were you know trying not to gossip and try not to talk about but there was also turmoil within the kingdom and then comes the news that David went to the Philistines you see Not only was Not only was was God perfecting things in David but God was changing something about Israel you see where did they start with they said we don't want God we want a man so now they have a man who's Fel who has failed them tremendously who isn't a king has lost his mind has literally got insane acts out of fear and rage and has these the the these moments where he's possessed of an evil spirit and now we have David who we all loved and I'm sure everyone talked about hey you know you're going to be the next king he's going to be the next king and you know word probably spread around cuz all of his other brothers were there when Samuel anointed David and and and Jonathan said you're going to be the king and I'll be a right-hand man and and so but then David Goes to the Philistines so now Israel has what are they going to do who who who so God's trying to to tell them look you got to stop trusting in the men got to stop trusting in the man so you trusted in Saul and he failed you I picked him because I knew you would like him to teach you a lesson that this isn't what you want and then I brought David and you thought you found your another man the next man man this is the man this is the man people do that they go to church to church this is the pastor this is the pastor and they will do that for the rest of their lives until they realize it's not the pastor so they realize that it's God to be Christ and and God will show them things and give them glimpse into things about the pastor that maybe you wouldn't even know because your eyes are on Christ so it doesn't matter but they see all the problems so their eyes aren't on Christ and so they go to the next king So now David is the Phil that's right and word spread and so it says even here that that in in 1st Samuel 28 the next chapter that David was ready to go fight with King Ashish you know he was bit of a turmoil but he was going to go with with the Philistines I don't know he was he was probably so discouraged he probably thought well I'll just go and try not to kill too many of them you have to remember David was a man he was a man after God's Own Heart but he was still a man I'm a man I make mistakes and so do you so here's David and and there's this battle within there's this battle within and I want to read this quote here it's in why little Bethlehem it says poor David and his mind all confused he thought how can it be Lord you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know what they're going through when you think of promises God has made then why don't it come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate with but there's many frustrations in the heart of a real leader it's a bit of a reading but I I just I cut it where I could and I I had to read most of it he says David sitting there his throat burning him it was in the middle of summer so David is is up there in the caves of adah I think is what it was and correct me if I'm wrong but and he says he says we'll just kind of read through this he says talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now he says David taken refuge in this little place in this little shelter everywhere he could get to the little strongholds that he could hold into then he got up on the mountain on that hot middle of the summer when the heat was tremendous his throat parching and fluster and fears in his heart and wondering oh God how could it be you poured that oil upon me not because I chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the Sheep out yonder and told me you give me this to serve your people and here you've got me between the fires everywhere brother says that was going through his heart are you thankful for the eyes of a prophet that was going through his heart and and and and I really encourage you to go listen to him preach this this is a couple of years after 1956 when he preached the indictment you can hear it in his voice he is burdened in his heart doors are starting to close things are starting to shift he doesn't know what's going to happen to him so he's in himself he's there with David standing on the on the Cliff's Edge looking down to the chaos around him and many times you and I are in the same exact position we're standing there saying Lord I don't understand that's right because you're carrying the promise you understand you're carrying the Promise by God's grace we're going to show you it has to be this way it has to be that way there has to be a battle within you must be perfected and he'll do it in your life between the fires he sat up on the Hill and he looked down and there the Philistines had come in and garrisoned right in Bethlehem his little home then his little city was under government control of the enemy not only that but his own Father's House Jesse's house was under bondage to the Philistines you know I don't I don't know the type there but his father's house was in bondage there was his own Nation his own church against him he had spent all those years serving them and they had turned on him he had spent all those years coming in and going out and and fighting the Philistines and and and and doing all of the things that that that a a a good you know soldier of the king should do and and and everything matched up and everything was right yet he's in this position why what what about him did Saul hate the fact that he was carrying the promise why is your life the way it is because the devil knows you're carrying the promise and he'll anoint men who are called of God to get under your skin Saul was God's anointed Saul went to be with Samuel God used him to get under David's skin God used him to perfect David and God does the same thing to you because you're carrying the promise you have been anointed you have been anointed to sit on his throne but there's a battle within there's a great battle within and sometimes this is how it manifests in your life there was his own Nation his own church against him here was the enemy he was fighting here is the church people he was fighting not because he wanted to but because he was forced to do it many times we're forced to do things and say things that we don't want to say a real spiritual leader but he's forced to do it I mean you're reading the quote with me he has to take his side and show his colors I'll take the way with the Lord's dispised few I was telling uh Brother David here the other night that I'm I'm anti-ad when I see the majority doing something I get very concerned we had this we had this war in Ukraine manifesting and and all of the sudden I started seeing all these cute little signs blue and yellow support Ukraine support Ukraine and then they were there NE and I'm not going to get into politics I'm just making a point they were there next to the pride flag and I thought I'm concerned and then you talk to people who know what's going on and you realize why you're concerned things aren't always as they appear so whenever I see a majority doing something I'm skeptical and the Lord is the same way it's the despised few right I mean you think about it the the Israelite or the the disciples with Jesus I mean this was the Messiah they had all this this following you know 70 other disciples if I have my math right and and all these signs and these wonders and he feeds 5,000 and then they follow him across the sea and they said hey do it again we're hungry you know and and totally missing the point and so then God says Jesus says hey well unless you drink my blood or eat my flesh and everybody of the church turn their backs on the word God is calling again I'm not here to say who's Saul we're not doing that that's up to God God is calling a bride from a church right because the bride of Christ is carrying the promise and you have to be called spiritually maybe even physically to the caves of caves of Abdullah to inti the deserts of inti to to the stronghold holds of of the Wilderness while the rest of the church looks on and says you really have lost it but you see David knew where he stood on the word you see God will put you things and I'm and I and I I brother Chad understands this other the ministers here understand this You Preach where you're living I'm preaching What I'm Living God under God knows that there's certain things you have to endure certain things that that need to be taken from you that that you have to be perfected and the only way you can do he can do that is when he puts you between the fires when he puts you in a place where where we're even even in doing the right thing there's opposition and and and there's suspicion sometimes and and and and all of these kind of things and and um but the lord always has a plan the lord always has a plan so he says here was David standing back here not knowing what to do yet knowing that on him rested the anointing God put you through things through hardships in such a way where you're ready to then say am I right am I am I am I my standard right and where do you take it as a mature Son of God you don't take it to that Pastor or that Pastor or that brother you go back to the word you see there there's things in our life sometimes we don't have right and there's opposition because God wants us to fix those things but all you will become is a parrot of men if you don't go back to the word every single time if you're going to stand for a standard it's got to be the standard of the word and then you know you know you see why could David endure what he endured cuz he knew he knew he knew who he was he knew what his calling was he knew the promise he had a revelation of his destination he had a revelation of who he was and what he was supposed to do and when the opposition rose up against him he didn't cave to it because he had something to stand on and if what you're standing on is not Revelation and opposition Rises up you will cave so your foundation must be the rock which is a revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you personally that's why that's so so important but God will God will challenge your position he will use things to challenge your position and he will go beyond the workplace and right into the church right into the the message Community he will come right in and do something to get under your skin and if you're like me you'll get in the flesh then God will correct you and next time you you'll get more in the spirit and a little less In the Flesh and God will correct you because if if your heart is in the place where you say God no matter what I want to be right on your word I want to be right in your will which his word is his will see yet knowing that on him rested the anointing now his Warriors they knew that anointing was there they knew David was going to be king so they could stand with David the Warriors could stand with d David cuz they knew it was the truth see remember David types Christ The Warriors you and I we can stand with Christ because we know he's the anointed one we know he is the one who has it all in control and all we have to do is learn to follow him better every day he says look through that spiritual sight Yonder that he's coming King I'll serve him if it's death let me die if it's my family it's my loved ones if it's my denomination it's everything let me serve him I'll stay to him that's the Warriors of God like was with David they had their hands on their sword walking anytime that's the way God's Warriors walk ready they had to are you kidding me David had the Philistines and Saul hunting them down constantly cuz you have to remember Saul lost a big battle to the Philistines and they came in and took over a large portion of Israel so they were there in the land and David is sitting there saying why are the Philistines walking on our promise why won't somebody rise up and do something and he fought when he could and he went out and he did things but it was it was underneath the leadership of the King Saul Saul was the one who had to rise up and do something about it you see God has a plan God has a for format to things and and many times he will put you in the position where you're looking to the leader saying I want you to do something why won't you do something but it was in Saul's hands and all David could do was wait on the Lord all he could do was wait on the Lord so his Warriors they had to walk ready so David was a fugitive right he was a fugitive and um there was there's somebody else he says that's a long ways up there and our church it's here so I can do that I ain't going to work here he says he which he's talking about Christ was represented in both David and warriors because he was the king and he was the warrior who came and broke through the enemy's lines conquer death Hell In The Grave amen so now he says in this is in 1963 now while same Sermon Just couple few years later and David trying to get back to his own home and could not do it because the Philistines were Garris around garrisoned around Bethlehem and it was and and excuse me and David trying to get back to his own home could not do it was out in the wilderness because he had become a fugitive to the people or there was ousted he says what a beautiful picture that is of Christ today a fugitive he is he says now you say that can't be well if you believe the Bible it is the Bible said in the leoan church age that Christ was on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in his own church trying to get back in his own church so we looked at David and and and we David is going through this situation and we're going to we're going to leave David hanging in the wilderness for right the next few minutes because he was a shadow a type of Christ and you and I are the bride say Amen you can believe it at least hopefully as you said amen in your head if you didn't say it out loud but you got to believe it don't don't be worried that maybe you're not the bride you got to believe it you got to take hold of it and and say I'm the bride I'm the bride you know don't get don't get arrogant about it make sure you're living the word of God but say you're the bride and Christ is manifesting himself through the bride okay I we're going to bring this try to bring this down to where we are today so what is what is God doing in the day and age that we live in right now he's calling you he's calling us higher he's calling us out of the church if you're the bride of Christ he's calling you out of the church not the building the system the ideas of man he says now you see this is I know this is stuff you know but he says now you see it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is the bride age as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church or a bride out of a church you see the same thing in type taking them to the Glorious Eternal promised land now we uh um Elisha is a a type of the Bride right I'm really going to need your help here you don't have to be vocal I'm not not begging you but just just stay with me here Elisha is the type of the bride God is so we have David he's in stuck in the wilderness right now we need to get back to him so you got to come with me so David is a type of Christ stuck in the wilderness so Christ is also a fugitive in the day and age that we live in outside of the Leo to seea Knocking calling you and I out of the church and we are a type or Elisha was a type of the bride and there's a scripture says in in First Kings 19:19 so he departed then and found Elisha the son of Chaat who was plowing with 12 yolk of ox and before him and he with the 12 and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him now the number 12 you know there's a lot of things and and you probably have have heard it I don't have it all figured out but brother bam says 12 is the doctrine of the 12 apostles it was it was the transition between the law cuz the woman with the 12 stars in Revelations 12 was standing upon the law and it was it was Christ coming it was it was the introduction of the dispensation of Grace so here is Elisha and he's plowing with the doctrine of the Apostles and he's plowing very straight roads but AB branam said several places that's why God chose him because he would plow straight roads and not look behind him and he was plowing a team of 12 oxin y'all ever done that this was no small thing 12 oxen what do they weigh like 1,200 lb a piece controlling them back and forth I mean I couldn't even draw Furrow a a straight row in a tractor and he's holding on to 12 oxen but he said but this is this is the plowing straight rows with the doctrine of the 12 apostles so this is the ministry that issued in the seven Church ages this is the word that come forth so why why can't we just leave Elisha in the field he's plowing according to the word for the B says the 12 the do of the apost Apostles was what brought through the revelation of the Holy Ghost so he's plowing with the word of God he's plowing straight roads he is the church but God is calling him from something into something else so Elisha is about to become a fugitive he has a home he has a field everything's going fine and all of a sudden Elijah walks by and throws his mantle on him in other words he tosses the word at Elisha he doesn't say a thing I guess there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour he doesn't say a thing he just tosses the word to Elisha and Elisha says wow this isn't enough here and what does he do he sacrifices his past he slays his past and he feeds the people and he says I'm going to follow you and he follows Elijah for I think it's like 3 years Elijah does some prophecies and does some things and and and then but but then he goes he goes further than that so so he's just following Elijah I don't know I don't know I got he's got the word he knows the truth and Elijah said hey follow me and and Elisha says all right where are we going and we go there and we go there and we go there and there's a prophecy given and there's the prophecy come to pass you know it's the ministry of Elijah and then Elisha turns to him in gilgal and he says I need to go to bethl you should stay here God always challenges your faith he he sees your faith and so he tests it that's right he says well you really believe me well you go also Jesus said turn to the disciples will you go also that is not what we say when our church splits we don't look to the rest of that are there and say will you leave too we as a man we say please please don't go anywhere but he he he looks and says well you go also because he knows who he is he is supreme authority underneath Supreme control and if you are the word made flesh today brother says you have all the power you need within you all you do is lack the faith to activate it so you don't need more power you need more faith you need more revelation of who you are amen David had access to a power Israel could not understand David had access to something King Ashish could not understand David had access to something bayah his mighty warrior could not understand David had Faith Abraham had access to something Sarah for a while did not understand Abraham had access this is something lot did not understand because he had faith and because he had Faith he was unlocking the mystery in his life you want to know who you are you want to know who you are Faith cometh by hearing the word of God Revelation you see you don't go get Faith Faith finds you my wife and I we I I have a I have a truck an old truck and uh it's a it's a holds a special part in in my heart cuz I like old trucks and it's a but it's got 260,000 Mi on it we took it camping and it and it bit the dust and whole truck started to shake as we were parking the trailer back in our yard and and uh the engine started to knock and I had had a fuel leak and lost oil pressure and 270,000 mil on it it's 32 years old and so I talked to our mechanic friend there at the church and he said your engine's toast um and I had shut it off and I pushed it back into its parking spot you know I didn't even start it again I just okay well figure out what we're going to do with that and you know as time goes on I I really needed the truck I needed it I I I had work to do and things to get done and and I and I just was I was driving back to my house one day and I thought you know the Lord just kind of spoke to my heart and said why don't you pray for it and I thought Lord I've done that before and I was just I was just this is where God wants he wants you to be honest amen you know I I believe the access to Faith is through humility I said Lord I don't have enough faith for that I don't have enough faith for that you're going to have to show me because there there was a time in my life where where I had and I'll come back where I had a lot of allergies to foods and I I wait I I waited on God I I just committed myself to to just eating what I could eat and which was very little and I just put it on God's hands and then he called me to prayer and he healed me instantly so I said Lord you did it like that I'm not going to try to work something up I'm not going to try to make this up if you want if this is your will if this is you I don't have enough faith for it and I got home and my wife she looks at me she goes you know maybe we ought to just pray for the truck and uh so I said well you know funny you should mention that so we both went outside together and and and I'm serious saying to God I I had no expectations and I thought Lord just you know won't hurt but if you want to fix it you got to give me Revelation that you can fix it you've got to give me the faith that you can fix it give me something and what does God do he gives us his word not emotions not not another man's testimony he gives gives us his word and so arm in arm we both laid hands on the truck and began to pray and I felt awfully silly but all of a sudden something struck me and I realized I said Lord this is a man-made object but every element that makes it up you spoke into existence so every element that is in this truck is the literal spoken word of God you can fix it my wife and I talked later afterwards we both felt something move through our arms I climbed in the truck and it started with no problems and it's still running without any problems see God calls you he's going to give you the faith for it he God go you need something in your life you need to lean on God and say God I need you I need you to show me David's leaning on God he says God I I'm carrying the promise but there's a battle within I have a need but there's a battle within Lord I I'm carrying the promise you promis it in your word but but there's a disconnect in my heart between what you said and what I actually believe but God is faithful to give you the Revelation you can't grab Revelation by yourself God has to give it to you and do you know why he gives it to you because before the foundation of the world you were in his V you the foundation of the world you're in his thoughts you see that's the only way eternity that's the only way time can access eternity is you have to have a part of Eternity within you sir cu the two don't go together so Elisha is following Elisha Elijah and he then says in the hand of the Lord came upon him he says look perfectly type of the church look when they started the first journey was when they come out of the Dark Ages in Luther's age the second stage of the journey the school of the prophets was John Wesley's age a second great Revival the third stage at Jordan was the Pentecostal age now then the next stage is across Jordan when the supernatural takes place here we are entering into that so here's what the journey looked like they Journey from gilgal to bethl was Luther's age justification bethl to Jericho Wesley's age sanctification and each time at the close of the age there was a word you can stay that's right that's right the end of each age there's a challenge you can stay there's a place for you to stay it's a denomination which is just a man's idea each time there was a place for Elisha to stop and stay and he said I got to follow you that's right then it was Jericho to the east of Jordan they cross over Jordan the east of Jordan Pentecostal age the Holy Ghost the east of Jordan is the land of Gilead Gilead was given to originally half the tribe of Manasseh you had half the tribe of Manasseh and then two other tribes I don't remember them at the moment and then it just became to be known as the land of Gilead it kind of spread out and and Israel you know just it's just Gilead kind of like you know we we live in where we live he just say well a Treasure Valley but it's boisey and Nampa and all these things and so the land of Gilead I like to call it we're a little bit on my opinion I like to call it the land of redemption you say well it's east of Jordan well it's the land where you receive the revelation of redemption because as soon as you realize Redemption you'll find your feet in Jordan the priests had a step for her they had to have a revelation of redemption to put their feet into the water of the River Jordan they knew this promise was theirs what is your promise your Redemption and so the land of Gilead is the land where where uh Jacob wrestled with the angel the the river Jabbok it says he crossed the river Jabbok at the there's a a Ford a for or Ford there and he wrestles with with with with with laan Excuse me with the angel it's also where he separates where Jacob separates from laan Jacob received his revelation of redemption in his life he walked different see the lay of the land was different back then but he still received this revelation of his Redemption and it's also the birthplace of Elijah Elijah was born east of Jordan so Elijah has to go back to where he was born on the east of Jordan and it's there he tells Elisha he says if you watch me go you will receive a what is it twofold tenfold whatever double portion thank you you'll receive a double portion so I'm not going to get too crazy here but brother Brandon went to the west and then he came back to where he was from in the East and he opened the book or the Lord opened the book so now Elisha holds the book so Elisha was fine plowing the fields with the doctrine of the twel Apostles which is the New Testament but it says it's the foundation it's the New Testament the foundation but the Lord had something even more special for Elisha because it was time for Elisha to move from Leo toia into the bride age to move up higher see it wasn't a new word it was the opening of the word so Elisha is standing there he receives the mantle and now he goes from Gilead to the west of Jordan into his Eternal promise you see you rapturing Faith lays within the word so you are already feeding on the Eternal promise word as you feed on it what did Enoch do he fed on it and he fed on it and he fed on it until it completely changed his position you and I have the desire to attain to our position so as we feed on the word our position begins to change and begin to move into this place move up higher and higher and now it's Christ in flesh again in your life and there's the scripture in Revelations see brother said God chose Elisha because he would plow straight Rose and he wouldn't look behind him and he in Revelations there's the the the thing of the three unclean spirits like frogs but M says that's that's the of the Trinity looking back looking back you see Elisha comes across and you just hang on a second we'll come back to David Elisha comes across the back across River Jordan into the open book into the revealed word for his hour he's not going to go back plowing his Fields with 12 oxs and first of all he burned that bridge he burned that bridge behind him he left it I mean he he he gave himself no options of returning to that God wants to see you totally completely committed to following the word burn it all behind you that's right what is it burn the ship is that what they say burn it all behind you don't look back so Elisha goes forward in the word he takes the word in his hand i'm don't get ahead of myself 1 Corinthians 16 or 13:1 says when I was a child and we're going to turn a corner here so you just hang on when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things okay let's go back to David he's been waiting there in the wilderness for us we're back we're back to David we're back to you carrying the promise and the battle within Am David is up there reminiscing and like I said you go back and listen to this and you can just hear it in his voice this is stirring something inside of him this is this is where he was right then he says he he's saying David is is looking back to where he he's remembering his life and he says I remember when I sang his Praises in my childhood days when I heard in my sheep oh God take me back to that place take me back to my first love take me back and give me back my shepherd's staff give me back my herd of sheep let me alone back there to worship you don't read ahead he says I want to go back he's hurt he's broken the the the the responsibility of car bearing the promise is so great upon him the reproach is so great he'd rather go back right to his days of plowing the fields he'd rather go back to just the staff and the sheep and and and so what's compelling him to return is fear what's compelling him to return is unbelief what compelling him to return is discouragement in his life the word never said go back to being a shepherd of sheep the word said you're the anointed king but David's saying I don't see any manifestations of that promise in my life right now I do not see that I do not understand how you can do that so God take me back sometimes the fear of the unknown in front of us pushes us to go back to what's familiar but God says Don't Look Back it is vile in his sight to look back it is the mouth of the false prophet it is the mouth of the Dragon in other words it's Antichrist to look back says Don't Look Back take the ver of you Mir off cuz if you look back you're looking to the Antichrist and you'll crash Amen in your life and your Doctrine in your church don't look back but David in his discouragement says can't I just go back but let's not forget he's carrying the the promise so now the very thing that becomes that has become his burden is the very thing that's going to resurrect him from the pit it's the very thing that's going to lift him from his discouragement that sometimes we think that but we're in the heat of the battle something has got to be done we were boys once we're grownup men now the fight is on I remember when the saus boiled up on the floor and the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't get around the place nowhere here for people but it's not that way today he says the battle is on it's not William brandham the little boy preacher anymore you got to produce something David you have to produce something it's not good enough that you were a shepherd and that you did it really good and you SL slayed the bear and you slayed the lion that's good but that's not enough you need to produce something in your life there's got to be something different this time the time is on the battle is on the heat is on the time to be delivered the people Everyone is found written in the book now the time has come David is in his discouragement is trying to go back but something Rises up within David the very thing he's carrying that's causing discouragement Rises up within him and he says but you see he probably knew the story of Job And he says but I know my redeemer liveth but I know that one day I shall see God in this flesh though it be destroyed amen one day you will see God not when you die not when you Rapture but right now you have a promise of the word given to you calling you up saying you can do it you can do it cuz you're carrying the promise he says he's basically saying I didn't don't care about this if my name is scandalized they kick me in the streets that doesn't matter your desire is my command he says that's the real Soldier amen that's the real Soldier see Elisha saw Elijah go up and he took the word you see David said the his Warriors had to have their hands on the sword at all times there's a battle within because you're carrying the promise there's there there's a turmoil in the Kingdom because you're carrying the promise but David literally prophesied the demise of Saul when he said either he'll he will die of the I can't remember what he says but he'll die of his enemies is what he said there's two other options so he was waiting he was saying God you got to deal with it so now what in your life is is the Saul not not who what what in your life is Saul so your pride is it is it is it I can't think of anything but there's things in our life that are SOL there there there's you see even if there's a person it's not who it's what cuz you wrestle not against the against flesh but against the principalities and the powers of the air when you're faced with opposition and you know the standard is according to the word of God you look and you check you says yep there's a lion that's that's our standard or where you check says there's the ox that's our standard right Israel's hey everyone go to their standard all the Israelites looking around for the standard there's the ox all right that's where they went cuz they were they were of that standard ifraim or whoever it was right so you you find your standard your standard's the word now you can have the faith to carry the promise but it's because you're carrying the promise it's because you're carrying the promise that there is a battle within but that battle within I love the word of God it never ends so you might be discouraged because you're carrying the promise but it's a promise that will make you un undiscouraged encouraged and then you're carrying the promise so there's a battle within and it's that battle then that makes you more like the promise yes sir you need the battle that's right David needed the battle you need to fight within and sometimes sometimes sometimes you're standing you're standing in the wilderness you're standing at the caves and there's the Philistines and there's the church and you're saying I don't understand and you can get discouraged but I say to you where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also had spit the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over a hold of your promise you're carrying it anyway it's with you anyways lay a hold of it amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we we're we we're here because you called us to be here we're here because something within our souls compelled us to be here father and and I pray that tonight the word that was spoken would respond to that call from within our hearts Lord Jesus that father we could receive Lord that I could receive encouragement tonight Lord Jesus father you have called us to something Beyond even our own understanding you have called us to something many times beyond the understanding of those around us but Lord you have given us a promise and father we want to carry that we want to carry that with the character of David Lord we want to carry that with the character of Abraham Lord we want to carry that with the character of Enoch with the character of of of japheth Lord with the character of of of of of each one down through the scriptures because we want to complete this thing Lord Jesus because you said they without us were not perfected oh God the responsibility is is is now upon our shoulders but thank goodness you live within us because the responsibility is upon your shoulders Lord Jesus Jesus we're looking to you father give us the faith that we need to access the power that you've given us in our lives to overcome every day this flesh man that we could surrender more to you every day thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen I don't know who I turn it over to amen you know the the the world has a saying 1% better every day and uh I believe for a Christian that's 1% more surrendered to Christ every day every day look for that thing that you can surrender to him and attack it with vengeance amen God bless you lead me Lord and I will follow Lead Me Lord and I will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord and I will go Lead Me Lord lead me Lord and I will follow Lead Me Lord and I will go you have called me I will [Music] answer Lead Me Lord and I will go Lead Me Lord lead me Lord and I will follow Lead Me Lord and I will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord I will [Music] go amen what a good word and how many of you realize that it's the promise with within that's causing my flesh all this trouble but it's the promise within that's going to overcome My Flesh amen praise God it was the promise in Christ that caused all of the conflict but it was the promise in Christ that brought the overcoming resurrection power amen the Press is on because of what's inside and so the outside may have to get torn down a little bit and break way so what's inside can take its place amen where's the problem coming from from the anointing cuz the prophet anointed us he poured the oil over us and called us bride that caused all of our problems what's the solution to all my problems because he poured the oil on us and called us bride and anointed us to be the bride amen oh it was so good I say God help us to burn The Oxen and just follow the word help us to have confidence in what's been put in our hand as Elijah went up he dropped that mantle amen which is a sign of his office amen and she's going to eat the book and prophesy again let's trust what's been put in our hands it'll overcome friends amen we feel weak we feel uncapable that's a good place to feel in the flesh but inside that thing will overcome amen God help us to keep pressing forward I loved what he said about the frogs they look back amen he who putteth his hand to the plow and even turth to look back is not worth of the higher God's always forward God's always higher amen help us to go forward and help us to go higher you know where we're going to find Victory forward amen but it's scary it's unknown it's risky it's problematic but it's the only way to Victory the only way out of our problem is forward never backwards if David would have stayed tending his father's sheep he might have had pretty simple basic life but he would have never fulfilled the promise in his life amen if Peter would have kept just fishing he may have had half the trouble that he had he probably wouldn't have been crucified hanging upside down but he would have never fulfilled the promise that was in his life if we would have just stayed simple lives and like the rest of the world we probably wouldn't have as much problems as we've had but we would have never fulfilled the promise that's in our lives right amen help us to go forward God help us to go forward I was encouraged by the reality of the sermon by the the truth is always real brother B said you can't paint Christianity like all your problems go away and everything's fine no problems start when you sign up with Christ amen I love the reality of the sermon I appreciate our brother I appreciate his humility and his honesty his transparency and we pray the Lord a blessing brother Chris is going to be going up uh next weekend not this weekend but next weekend the weekend after Thanksgiving and he's going to be doing meetings for brother Nathaniel sias up in Lorraine with brother Simon Abbott Simon's flying over and they're doing those meetings together so be praying for him how many will remember to pray for him that God will bless him and use him there brother Nathaniel also invited all of us to the meeting but he says you're all invited but you can't all come cuz he doesn't have room for everybody amen but uh he sent me a flyer I'm going to uh print it off and we'll have it posted on the bulletin board but if a few of you like to go up amen may the Lord bless you and that I'm sure they would love to have you amen let's just bow our heads thank the lord lord Jesus thank you for your word Lord I'm encouraged Lord by what you brought Lord through our brother how you're encouraging us to keep moving forward Lord that have the courage to cross back over Jordan into our promises Lord we don't know what the future holds we we know certainly there'll be difficulties rejections maybe more pain but oh God it's the only way for your purpose to be fulfilled in our lives God I pray that you give us that real genuine faith that comes from the soul lord that is imparted by your own gift Lord that you give us Revelation so that we have confidence in who we are and what you've called us to and that we have the confidence Lord that you would remove every obstacle that you would move everything out of the way so that your word can come into manifestation oh we get discouraged sure we get uncertain of what's going to happen next we feel a little bit beat down and maybe wore out but oh God it doesn't change what you thought of us before the foundation of the world you have a plan and we put our trust in that plan God give us courage to keep moving forward as we trust in you we love you father we thank you we ask God a special blessing over our brother Chris over his wife and their children Lord as they stay in visit a few days and travel up to Lorraine I pray that you would use our brother Chris and use brother Simon to minister your word in those meetings that they'd be a special time of Fellowship for the saints that gather there and Lord above all may we walk out of here encouraged to keep trusting you when we're discouraged help us to trust you and we don't know what's going on and why we're between the fires help us to keep trusting you for when there is no way you are the way when we have no answers you are the answer and we don't have to know what it is we only know who it is Lord and we trust in you who will open every door who will remove every obstacle we put our confidence in you we put our trust in what you've told us Lord we love you we ask that you would bless us as we part May these words that we heard become part of us may become our experience may become our life may become part of our speech may we move forward Lord continually pressing ahead we love you we thank you for the encouragement we ask your blessings upon the word and upon us may it live in Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all will me Lord and I will follow Lead Me Lord Lord I will go you have called me I will answer Lead
