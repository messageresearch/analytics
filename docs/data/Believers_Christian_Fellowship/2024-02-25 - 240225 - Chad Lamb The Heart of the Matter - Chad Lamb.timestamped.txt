[19:05] you of
[19:05] that and then let's look here at 1st
[19:08] Samuel 16 verse
[19:15] 7 says but the Lord said unto Samuel
[19:18] look not on his countenance or on the
[19:19] height of his stature because I have
[19:21] refused him for the Lord seeth not as a
[19:24] man seeth for man lookth on the outward
[19:27] appearance but the Lord Lord lookth on
[19:29] the heart amen God bless you as you take
[19:32] your
[19:36] seats
[19:38] amen I wanted to take out of there for a
[19:42] a subject if we could preach on the
[19:44] title The Heart of the matter the heart
[19:47] of the matter and this is a little bit
[19:50] unusual for me um yesterday I I had an
[19:54] inspiration I had a thought and I was
[19:55] working on it all day and and I was
[19:57] working on notes and I was enjoying the
[19:59] thought and it was a it was a good one I
[20:02] liked it and it come by inspiration one
[20:04] day at the end of service I jotted down
[20:05] some notes and I just felt comfortable
[20:08] and I was working and as I got to
[20:10] evening I kept progressing in the
[20:12] evening and I and uh I started having a
[20:14] strange feeling I started feeling
[20:16] disconnected from my my text and I don't
[20:20] know how to describe that I can't
[20:21] explain that to you but but there's a
[20:23] certain connection that you have with
[20:25] the word as it's growing in your heart
[20:26] and I started feeling disconnected with
[20:28] the text and and then it come along
[20:30] about 8:30 or uh somewhere past 8:30 and
[20:34] I just stopped and I prayed I said Lord
[20:37] why do I feel disconnected with this
[20:39] text uh it's a good text it's good word
[20:42] it's and you've inspired it I know it
[20:44] was inspired and and while I was sitting
[20:46] there praying all of a sudden an
[20:48] inspiration just swept in and just swept
[20:50] right through me and so I saved my I
[20:53] saved my word document I was working on
[20:54] I filed it away and I opened a blank
[20:56] sheet and started from script scratch so
[20:59] I I I just pray for me amen just pull I
[21:02] believe it's the Lord but it's not even
[21:04] a subject that's brand new it's
[21:06] something I've been meditating on for
[21:07] quite a while uh at least a month now
[21:10] it's been a meditation in my heart and I
[21:12] absolutely did not feel ready to preach
[21:15] it I did not feel prepared I didn't feel
[21:17] like I hand a hand on the subject and I
[21:19] still don't amen but I believe it's the
[21:22] will of the Lord so we're going to we're
[21:24] going to move forward and ask God to
[21:25] lead us step by step and as we get into
[21:28] it you'll see why I'm a little hesitant
[21:31] to to preach it I didn't feel personally
[21:32] ready but I believe God put his hand on
[21:35] it and said Now's the
[21:36] Time let's turn together to Numbers
[21:39] Chapter 4 and I just want to lay uh this
[21:43] down as a foundation and and maybe build
[21:46] on there and share with you where my
[21:48] inspiration is in
[21:50] this Numbers chapter 9 this is when uh
[21:54] Moses is rehearsing the law and the
[21:57] ordinances uh to the children of Israel
[22:00] and uh he's going to go over the law of
[22:03] the Passover and the ordinance for
[22:05] Passover and in Numbers chapter
[22:09] 9 and we're going to begin at verse 4
[22:12] numbers 9 and
[22:13] 4 and Moses spake unto the children of
[22:16] Israel that they should keep the
[22:18] Passover and they kept the Passover on
[22:20] the 14th day of the first month that
[22:22] even in the wilderness of siani
[22:24] according to all that the Lord commanded
[22:26] Moses so did the children of isra Israel
[22:29] and there were certain men who were
[22:30] defiled by the by the dead body of a man
[22:33] that they could not keep the Passover on
[22:35] that day and they came before Moses and
[22:38] before Aaron on that day and those men
[22:40] said un unto him we are defiled by the
[22:43] dead body of a man therefore we we kept
[22:46] back that we may not offer an offering
[22:48] of the Lord in this appointed season
[22:51] among the children of Israel so Moses is
[22:54] now this is they're keeping the Passover
[22:57] and
[22:58] there there was a a Commandment that God
[23:01] gave and the Commandment was that on the
[23:04] 14th day of the first month they would
[23:06] keep the Passover because that was when
[23:08] God originally gave them the Passover
[23:10] Lamb when they were in Egypt and he was
[23:12] going to send a Death Angel by uh he he
[23:16] he instituted the Passover by giving
[23:18] them a lamb and the blood on the lent on
[23:20] the doorpost amen would be a token Amen
[23:23] to the to the Lord to everybody on the
[23:25] outside that a lamb had been slain for
[23:27] that house and the Death Angel would
[23:29] pass and that was the beginning of the
[23:30] Passover and God was very specific in
[23:33] his instructions he told them that they
[23:35] had to be cleansed they had to be
[23:36] purified the leaven had to be purged
[23:38] from the house there had to be a certain
[23:40] preparation in order to partake of this
[23:43] Passover and but they were to do it
[23:45] specifically he gave them a date
[23:47] specifically you are to do this on the
[23:49] 14th day of the first month because that
[23:52] is when I delivered you and brought you
[23:55] out so now there's some men they're in a
[23:58] bit of a pickle now because they have to
[24:00] keep the Passover on a specific time but
[24:04] yet they're supposed to be cleansed and
[24:05] they're not cleansed
[24:08] because they were defiled by the dead
[24:11] body of a man so now what do they do
[24:14] they have to keep it but they can't keep
[24:19] it they're stuck in
[24:22] between now let's look
[24:24] here at what Moses said verse 8 and
[24:28] Moses said unto them stand still and I
[24:30] will hear what the Lord will command
[24:32] concerning
[24:33] you and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[24:36] Speak unto the children of Israel saying
[24:37] if any man of you or of your posterity
[24:41] shall be unclean by reason of a dead
[24:43] body or be in a journey a far off yet he
[24:46] shall keep the Passover unto the Lord
[24:48] the 14th day of the second month at even
[24:52] they shall keep it and eat it with
[24:54] unleavened bread and bitter herbs they
[24:56] shall leave none of it it unto the
[24:58] morning nor break any bone of it
[25:00] according to all the ordinance of the
[25:01] Passover they shall keep it but the man
[25:04] that is clean and and is not in a
[25:07] journey and for bearth to keep the
[25:09] Passover even the same Soul shall be cut
[25:11] off from among his people because he
[25:13] brought not the offering of the Lord in
[25:15] his appointed season that man shall bear
[25:17] his
[25:18] sin so all of the sudden when there was
[25:21] when there was a um an impossible
[25:25] obstacle that these men were they have
[25:27] the law the law was specific the
[25:29] Commandment of the Lord told them take
[25:31] this on the 14th day of the first month
[25:33] but he also told them that they had to
[25:34] be
[25:35] clean now they're stuck in between so
[25:38] Moses inquires of the Lord and the Lord
[25:40] tells him now you can come up with an
[25:42] additional ordinance to the ordinance
[25:44] I'm going to expand the ordinance in
[25:46] case you ever hit this circumstance
[25:48] again now you may take it on the 14th
[25:51] day of the second month so if you're on
[25:53] a journey or if you're sick and God I
[25:56] mean God is so gracious he just expanded
[25:58] his commandment to include those that
[26:00] would be in a journey or those that
[26:02] would be defiled in some way unclean but
[26:04] after he expanded it he said if there's
[26:07] any who's able to take it and they don't
[26:09] take it he sh his soul shall be cut off
[26:11] from
[26:11] Israel so it's still it's still the
[26:14] Commandment of the Lord so let's go to 2
[26:17] Chronicles 30
[26:26] together second Chronicles
[26:34] 30 and here in 2 Chronicles Hezekiah has
[26:39] just become king and after Hezekiah
[26:41] become king Ahab and and his house had
[26:44] brought such defilement into the house
[26:46] of God Hezekiah Now commands the priest
[26:49] to go clean out the house of God and
[26:51] we're going to get back to serving
[26:53] Jehovah and that's where we're at in in
[26:56] time here and so so Chapter 30 2
[26:58] Chronicles 30:1 and Hezekiah sent to All
[27:02] Israel and Judah and wrote letters also
[27:04] to Ephraim and Manassa that they should
[27:06] come to the house of the Lord at
[27:08] Jerusalem to keep the Passover unto the
[27:10] Lord God of Israel for the king had
[27:13] taken Council and his princes and all
[27:15] the congregation in Jerusalem to keep
[27:17] the Passover in the second month for
[27:19] they could not keep it at that time
[27:21] because the priests had not Sanctified
[27:23] themselves sufficiently sufficiently
[27:26] neither had the people gathered say
[27:28] together to Jerusalem so we find a
[27:31] situation where now Hezekiah now when he
[27:33] becomes king he starts a purging process
[27:35] to purge the house of God tells the
[27:37] priest to sanctify themselves but they
[27:39] start too late they're not able to keep
[27:41] the Passover on the 14th day of the
[27:43] first month because the priests weren't
[27:45] Sanctified yet they hadn't finished
[27:46] cleaning out the house of the Lord so
[27:48] now he goes to this expanded law amen
[27:52] where God expanded it and made a
[27:54] provision for this and now they come
[27:55] down and they're going to now they're
[27:57] going to keep the Passover and the
[27:59] second month according to what Moses had
[28:02] said all right we're all on the same
[28:05] page now let's go
[28:07] down to uh paragraph
[28:14] 13 and I just want to let you know this
[28:16] is the text that started this meditation
[28:19] in my heart some time
[28:21] ago and we're getting ready to read it
[28:25] and there assembled at Jerusalem much
[28:26] people to keep the Feast of unleavened
[28:28] bread in the second month a very great
[28:31] congregation and they arose and took
[28:32] away the altars that were in Jerusalem
[28:34] and all the altars for incense took they
[28:36] away and cast them into the brook Kidron
[28:39] then they killed the Passover on the
[28:40] 14th day of the second month and the
[28:42] priest and the Levites were ashamed and
[28:44] Sanctified themselves and brought in the
[28:46] burnt offering into the house of the
[28:48] Lord and they stood in their places
[28:50] after their manner according to the law
[28:51] of Moses the man of God the priest
[28:54] sprinkled the blood which they received
[28:55] of the hand of the Levites for there
[28:57] were many in the congregation that were
[28:59] not Sanctified therefore the Levites had
[29:01] the charge of the killing of the
[29:02] Passover for everyone that was not clean
[29:05] to sanctify them unto the Lord for a
[29:08] multitude of the people even many of
[29:10] Ephraim and Manasseh iser and Zebulon
[29:12] had not cleansed themselves yet did they
[29:15] eat the Passover otherwise than it was
[29:18] written I want you to take note of
[29:21] this they weren't
[29:24] cleansed they hadn't Sanctified
[29:26] themselves according to the law they
[29:28] were not allowed to eat the
[29:31] Passover let's read it one more
[29:34] time yet they did eat the Passover
[29:37] otherwise than it was written that means
[29:40] not according to
[29:42] Moses but Hezekiah prayed for them
[29:45] saying the good Lord pardon everyone
[29:48] that prepareth his heart to seek God the
[29:50] L the Lord God of his fathers though he
[29:53] be not cleansed according to the
[29:55] purification of the sanctuary
[29:57] and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and
[30:00] healed the
[30:04] people what a
[30:06] scripture here we are in the Old
[30:09] Testament under the Covenant of law not
[30:12] the Covenant of
[30:13] Grace and here in the Old Testament when
[30:16] when they get into a conundrum in
[30:18] keeping the law God recognized that they
[30:21] weren't failing to keep the law because
[30:23] of a lack of desire to keep the law but
[30:25] they were actually they wouldn't take it
[30:28] unclean this is in the Book of Numbers
[30:30] they wouldn't defile the Lord's Passover
[30:33] so they come to Moses and say we kept
[30:34] back because we were unclean by the
[30:37] because of a a body of a a dead body of
[30:39] a man and so now but God in his
[30:42] graciousness said now here's the
[30:43] provision for that but now we come to
[30:46] hezekiah's day when when the whole
[30:48] nation had been backslid and and the
[30:50] King Ahab had wrought wickedness and
[30:52] they were polluted and had not been
[30:53] keeping the Passover and now Hezekiah is
[30:56] trying to bring the the nation back to
[30:58] the word back to God back to the right
[31:00] worship and when he's doing so the
[31:02] priests are not Sanctified in time
[31:04] they're not prepared to keep it
[31:06] according to the word the first day or
[31:08] the 14th day of the first month but
[31:10] there's this expanded provision so they
[31:12] move into that amen but the expanded
[31:14] provision was to take those who couldn't
[31:16] take it on the first month and give them
[31:18] an opportunity to take it the second
[31:20] month but there was no opportunity the
[31:22] first month because of the situation
[31:24] they were
[31:25] in amen so now now they come now you
[31:28] have people that want to worship God
[31:30] they want to take the Passover they want
[31:32] to keep the law of Moses they want to
[31:34] honor God but now they're in another
[31:36] pickle because they didn't have an
[31:38] opportunity the first they didn't have
[31:40] time to prepare now they're not cleansed
[31:42] according to the purification of
[31:44] sanctuary not according to what is
[31:45] written now but they want to worship God
[31:48] so Hezekiah the king stands in the Gap
[31:51] and Hezekiah says Lord I pray that you
[31:54] would forgive them and it says amen that
[31:57] those that that that prepare their heart
[32:00] let's read it I just love it he said and
[32:02] Hezekiah prayed this is the bottom of
[32:04] Verse 18 Hezekiah prayed for them saying
[32:06] the good Lord pardon everyone that
[32:08] prepareth his heart to seek God the Lord
[32:10] God of his fathers though he be not
[32:13] cleansed according to the purification
[32:14] of the sanctuary and the Lord hearkened
[32:18] to
[32:18] Hezekiah this wasn't in the law it
[32:21] wasn't Moses it wasn't written they
[32:24] actually were doing something contrary
[32:27] to the
[32:28] law yes
[32:30] sir Hallelujah when you get to the
[32:33] letter of the law they were contrary to
[32:35] the letter of the law but when you deal
[32:37] with the spirit of the law they exactly
[32:39] matched what God wanted they wanted to
[32:41] worship God they wanted to keep the
[32:43] Passover they were trying to come back
[32:45] to the Lord but they they couldn't do it
[32:48] the right way amen so somebody stood in
[32:51] the Gap and said oh God would you please
[32:53] overlook this amen and the Lord
[32:56] hearkened to he Hezekiah amen why
[32:58] because Hezekiah couldn't change the
[33:00] word he couldn't manipulate the
[33:02] situation he just said Lord this is
[33:04] where we're at and God hearkened to him
[33:06] and healed every one of
[33:10] them oh praise God Amen we think Grace
[33:13] only showed up in the New Testament no
[33:15] it's all the way back there in the Old
[33:18] Testament amen and this is the this is
[33:22] the uh the thought that just started
[33:24] rolling
[33:25] over I thought
[33:28] my you can do the wrong thing for the
[33:31] right
[33:33] reason
[33:35] yes technically it was
[33:42] wrong
[33:44] listen times haven't changed people
[33:46] haven't
[33:47] changed everything's the same amen I'm
[33:51] sure Hezekiah had a few legalists around
[33:55] him
[33:57] you can't do this Moses said they could
[34:00] open the scroll they could go to the
[34:02] book they could read
[34:05] it
[34:07] sir do you understand what I'm saying
[34:10] this is why I didn't feel prepared to
[34:11] preach this because you go too far down
[34:13] this strain it scares
[34:20] me but you could go to the book and you
[34:23] could read the black and white you could
[34:25] read the print you could say Moses said
[34:29] we have to do it this way if we can't do
[34:30] it this way and and and there's no
[34:33] chance for them amen but Hezekiah amen
[34:36] maybe he just had a heart that was in
[34:38] tune with God's heart maybe he
[34:40] understood that there's a reason that
[34:42] God said these things amen and then
[34:44] there was a reason God expanded his own
[34:46] law am mean when somebody wanted to
[34:48] worship him but they weren't able to
[34:50] worship him he already witnessed where
[34:52] God expanded the law maybe Hezekiah is
[34:55] actually catching the nature of God gone
[34:57] maybe Hezekiah amen maybe Hezekiah can
[35:00] see what God's doing amen why God wrote
[35:03] what he wrote and why God said what he
[35:05] said the purpose behind the law the
[35:08] purpose behind expanding the law maybe
[35:10] Hezekiah he may not have the letter of
[35:13] the law and he may not be able to keep
[35:14] the letter of the law but Hezekiah has
[35:17] caught the mind of the
[35:19] [Applause]
[35:21] author and that's what brother bham said
[35:23] he said I may not know my bible really
[35:25] well but I know the author really
[35:28] well amen I think that's a better place
[35:31] to be I would rather know the author
[35:33] really well and have the mind of the
[35:35] author really well and understand what
[35:38] is his intent and what he wrote why did
[35:40] he write it that way and by the grace of
[35:42] God now we come to the end of time where
[35:45] he's taken the veil off of the whole
[35:46] book and showed us what his purpose has
[35:48] been amen why so we can know the author
[35:52] so we can catch the heart of what he's
[35:55] saying
[35:58] amen 2 Corinthians 3:6 I'm just going to
[36:01] read it to you but you can jot It Down 2
[36:02] Corinthians 3:6 said who also have made
[36:05] us able Ministers of the New Testament
[36:07] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[36:09] the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[36:13] life let's turn to
[36:16] Jeremiah
[36:25] 17
[36:30] Jeremiah
[36:33] 17 and un like to begin reading verse
[36:36] 9 Jeremiah
[36:38] 17:9 the heart is deceitful above all
[36:41] things and desperately wicked who can
[36:43] know it I the Lord searcheth the heart I
[36:48] try the Reigns even to give every man
[36:50] according to his ways and according to
[36:52] the fruit of his
[36:54] doings this scripture
[36:57] Thrills
[36:59] me because he doesn't say I'm going to
[37:02] give every man according to his
[37:04] doings he said that but that's not all
[37:06] he said he prefaced it with I search his
[37:10] Reigns and his heart and I'm connecting
[37:13] his doings with his heart amen if God is
[37:18] only judging their
[37:20] doings let's read it again I the Lord
[37:23] search the heart I try the Reigns even
[37:25] to give Every Man a according to his
[37:27] ways and according to the fruit of his
[37:28] doings if all he wanted to do was see
[37:31] their ways and their doings amen he
[37:33] didn't need to write the first part
[37:35] because he could base judgment solely
[37:37] upon the works the doings the ways and
[37:40] his doings but he's not basing his
[37:42] judgment solely upon their ways and
[37:44] their doings but he's attaching he's
[37:47] he's looking past their ways and their
[37:49] doings and he's looking at the intent of
[37:51] their heart and he's judging their ways
[37:53] and their doings by the intent in their
[37:55] heart
[37:57] amen this is
[37:59] God this is God Amen this is not what
[38:03] people have made God yeah this is God he
[38:07] he's not he you know the two pictures
[38:10] sometimes people talk about he he is not
[38:12] the the uh he's not the god of fire and
[38:15] retribution sitting with a club waiting
[38:17] to smack you every time you do wrong
[38:18] neither is he the doting old grandpa who
[38:20] lets everything go God is somewhere in
[38:22] between these two pictures God has a
[38:25] reality to him he has a natur to him he
[38:27] has a desire amen and to understand God
[38:30] and all of his word amen you have to
[38:32] understand his nature amen am because
[38:35] sometimes it's very difficult to
[38:37] understand because it seems like some
[38:39] people in the Bible get a pass and some
[38:41] people
[38:46] don't I mean we're we're going to have
[38:49] to get down nitty-gritty if you want to
[38:52] brother Billy Paul said in his testimony
[38:53] one time that sometimes it would confuse
[38:55] him because he had people come in with
[38:57] similar situations to talk to brother
[38:59] random and in one circumstance he would
[39:01] tell them one thing in another
[39:02] circumstance he would tell them
[39:03] something different but the Billy Paul
[39:05] it seemed like the same
[39:09] question the same
[39:11] circumstance and the Bible's very much
[39:13] the same
[39:15] way uh so as I started meditating on
[39:19] this I started
[39:22] thinking they did
[39:25] wrong
[39:27] Hezekiah and them they did wrong and
[39:30] they allowed them to do
[39:32] wrong they allowed those that gathered
[39:35] from Ephraim and Manasseh and zebulun
[39:38] who hadn't had time to be purified
[39:40] according to the purification of the
[39:41] sanctuary and not according to what was
[39:45] written and they let them eat the
[39:47] Passover and they took the Passover
[39:49] contrary to what Moses
[39:53] said and I just had fun wrapping my mind
[39:57] around this they were wrong but they
[40:00] were
[40:02] right they were right but they were
[40:06] wrong you mean you can do wrong and be
[40:09] right yes and you can do right and be
[40:15] wrong because it's a matter of the
[40:19] heart let's turn to First Peter I want
[40:22] to just give you just a simple
[40:24] example if we can
[40:30] so just keep pulling and keep praying
[40:32] because I'm just feeling my way through
[40:34] because like I said I don't feel utterly
[40:36] prepared you know for me when I Venture
[40:39] into a subject like this I I it makes me
[40:41] so nervous amen but God is pushing me
[40:44] beyond my boundaries and I'm so thankful
[40:46] for that I thank God for that and I want
[40:48] to move beyond my own my own
[40:50] limitations but but I feel like I'm
[40:53] dancing through
[40:55] landmines
[40:57] 1 Peter
[41:00] 213 1 Peter
[41:03] 213 says submit yourselves to every
[41:06] ordinance of man for the Lord's sake
[41:07] whether it be the king as supreme or
[41:09] unto Governors as unto them that are
[41:11] sent by him for the punishment of
[41:13] evildoers and for the praise of them
[41:15] that do well so we are supposed to obey
[41:19] the laws of the
[41:20] Lamb even Jesus when he was asked about
[41:23] paying taxes he told him you give unto
[41:24] Caesar what is Caesars you give unto God
[41:26] with his Gods brother random picks that
[41:28] up and he teaches us to obey we're we're
[41:30] to obey Governors and magistrates and
[41:32] the ruling
[41:34] Authority and one of those laws that
[41:38] brother venham was pretty strict about
[41:40] was
[41:42] speeding he was pretty tight on it he he
[41:45] he didn't believe that you should break
[41:47] the speed limit he didn't believe that
[41:48] you should intentionally drive over he
[41:50] he he felt like that was the law and we
[41:53] should as Christians obey the law here
[41:55] he says in the message and knowth and
[41:57] not he said yesterday coming up in the
[41:58] car we drove it in 2 days from Tucson
[42:00] here right 2,000 Mi Billy and I and so
[42:03] now that wasn't breaking any speed laws
[42:05] we stayed right I sat there if he's
[42:07] driving I rolled up my fist back like a
[42:10] shotgun with a hammer back and I seen
[42:12] him go over I said wait a minute boy now
[42:14] we're told to give Caesar what
[42:18] Caesars
[42:20] right so that's the law of the land that
[42:22] was reinforced by the
[42:24] prophet the question is if you have
[42:27] somebody bleeding out in your car and
[42:29] they just passed out and they're losing
[42:31] all their
[42:32] blood are you going to
[42:36] speed you mean you would violate the
[42:39] word of
[42:40] God and what the prophet
[42:43] said you people we're going to have an
[42:46] altar call all of you who shook your
[42:48] head yes well I was just testing you but
[42:51] now I know and I saw everyone there's
[42:53] going to be about 200 people around the
[42:55] altar
[42:57] what if somebody's having a massive
[42:58] heart attack in your car and they lose
[43:05] Consciousness tell you a funny
[43:07] story before my second child was
[43:12] born this is a funny
[43:16] story my wife wakes me up in the morning
[43:18] and she goes it's time to go to the
[43:20] hospital we had just come to the message
[43:23] I think we had been believing maybe a
[43:25] year and a half
[43:27] not even that year year year and a half
[43:29] just coming to the message maybe two
[43:32] years brand new
[43:34] babes so we get ready we get in the car
[43:37] we're driving to the hospital and we
[43:39] lived quite a bit a distance from the
[43:40] hospital I can't remember exactly how
[43:42] long it might have been 40 minutes 35 40
[43:44] minutes and we're driving along and my
[43:47] wife says we need to get there I said
[43:49] okay okay okay so I'm driving and we're
[43:51] going down the highway we lived around
[43:52] Cincinnati at the time we're going
[43:54] through Cincinnati traffic and she she
[43:57] said it again we really need to get
[43:58] there I said okay okay okay we're
[43:59] getting there we're getting there then
[44:02] finally a third time she said Chad we
[44:04] really need to get there and I looked at
[44:06] her and I said I'm going the speed
[44:14] limit God forgive
[44:20] me I think I ended up going five
[44:23] over I just couldn't let myself go
[44:26] beyond
[44:27] that we got to the hospital and Brianna
[44:30] was born 20 minutes after we pulled into
[44:32] the parking
[44:33] lot I should have went
[44:36] faster if I had it to do over we would
[44:40] go
[44:41] faster and I looked back at my
[44:43] childishness and my immaturity I was
[44:45] trying to do everything right amen and
[44:47] God saw my heart God I don't believe God
[44:49] condemn me for doing that it it was
[44:51] because IID lived all my life to myself
[44:53] and I had forsaken all of his laws and
[44:55] I'd come to the truth and I wanted to do
[44:57] everything the right way but I realized
[45:00] uh I had caught the the the letter but I
[45:02] might have missed the
[45:05] spirit and so we learned a few things
[45:08] along the way and you realize the law is
[45:12] in place because there's a motive behind
[45:14] that law there's a purpose behind it and
[45:17] the speed limit laws are to keep people
[45:18] safe and to prevent injury and loss of
[45:21] life so how could I in keeping the law
[45:25] cause loss of life with somebody
[45:28] bleeding out or dying of a heart attack
[45:30] in my car and I keep the letter of the
[45:32] law but I I defy the very purpose that
[45:36] that law is there because the law is
[45:37] there to prevent harm injury and to
[45:40] preserve life so now in order not to
[45:43] break this law I will allow whoever is
[45:46] in a medical emergency to die because I
[45:49] won't break the law and I have just
[45:51] circumvented the I've just destroyed the
[45:53] whole purpose behind the law is that we
[45:57] understand so I hope we're all on the
[45:58] same page so I am not I I'm not
[46:01] condoning lawlessness so please you you
[46:04] have to know me by now I like things
[46:06] black and white I like things
[46:07] straightforward I like things right but
[46:09] I'm learning as we move on in time God
[46:11] is not going to let us to stay in the
[46:13] black and white he's not going to let us
[46:14] stay in the easy decisions but things
[46:17] keep getting more and more complex all
[46:19] the time because God is trying to root
[46:21] out what's in the heart amen right amen
[46:25] he's trying to dig in there and root out
[46:27] of us what's in the heart and he's
[46:29] trying to show us that not by might nor
[46:31] by power but by my spirit say at the
[46:34] Lord we are not going to make this
[46:36] through a set of uh uh Traditions a set
[46:38] of Creeds or a set of rules there not
[46:40] there's not any way that this is
[46:41] possible that we're going to make it all
[46:43] the way to the Finish Line because we've
[46:45] just got a certain thing a standard that
[46:48] we can do no there's going to be things
[46:50] that are going to throw a monkey wrench
[46:52] in our
[46:53] dues and we'll land right in between two
[46:56] Commandments sometimes I don't know if
[46:58] you've ever been there but I've been
[47:00] there amen I land right in between two
[47:03] Commandments right in between two
[47:05] principles of God and I do not know what
[47:07] is the right thing to do and I can't go
[47:10] to a textbook I can't go to case studies
[47:13] I can't go down I can't I wish I could
[47:15] just go to the index pull up my problem
[47:18] find the page number go to that read it
[47:20] and just do it I can't do that because
[47:22] it's going to take spiritual leadership
[47:24] of the Holy Ghost that's going to lead
[47:26] us cuz it's not by might nor by power
[47:28] but by my spirit sayeth the
[47:31] Lord and I think we're going to have to
[47:33] get comfortable with that as we move on
[47:35] because situations are getting more
[47:38] complicated and it may just be me it may
[47:41] not be you but I feel like things are
[47:44] getting so much more complex amen but
[47:46] it's a perfect situation for us to be
[47:49] tuned into the author and for the
[47:51] author's life to come through US amen
[47:59] Amen in Isaiah 29:13 don't flip there CU
[48:02] we're going to go to Matthew next but
[48:04] I'm going to read it to you Isaiah 29:13
[48:07] wherefore the Lord said for as much as
[48:08] this people draw near me with their
[48:10] mouth and with their lips they do honor
[48:12] me but have removed their heart far from
[48:14] me and their fear toward me is taught by
[48:17] the precept of
[48:19] men they're just doing what other men
[48:22] are telling them to do that's their fear
[48:23] of God there's not any genuine in fear
[48:26] no real reverential honor and offering
[48:29] to God from the heart they're taught the
[48:32] fear of the Lord by obeying the
[48:34] Commandments of man the ordinances of
[48:36] man man says you you do this and you
[48:39] don't do this and this is the way we
[48:40] interpret the law and these are the
[48:41] Traditions we've added to the law and by
[48:44] keeping that that's how they learn the
[48:45] fear of the Lord but that's not what God
[48:48] wanted God wanted somebody who actually
[48:50] had a fear of God themselves that they
[48:53] wouldn't violate the law they would
[48:55] would do wrong they wouldn't go contrary
[48:57] to God because of their relationship
[48:59] with God and their fear of God and their
[49:02] love of God and their respect to God not
[49:05] just I did everything the church said do
[49:07] that's the fallacy of religion and
[49:09] that's why religion is so corrupt
[49:11] because it it it makes a false sense of
[49:14] righteousness a false security that if
[49:16] you do everything the church says do and
[49:18] you fall in line with everything the
[49:20] church teaches then you're somehow safe
[49:22] that's that's the fear of God by the
[49:24] precept of man
[49:26] am and listen it doesn't even mean that
[49:29] the church is teaching
[49:31] wrong sometimes you want to say oh that
[49:34] that that dirty church the church might
[49:36] have everything exactly right but if you
[49:38] in your heart don't have the fear of God
[49:40] and you're finding your security and
[49:42] keeping that that church order then then
[49:44] you absolutely haven't come to where God
[49:47] wants us to come yet because he wants us
[49:49] not by the precept of man but in our own
[49:52] heart he wants us to reverence
[49:54] him
[49:56] does God want obedience
[49:59] absolutely absolutely it's been a
[50:02] requirement from day one all the way
[50:05] through he does want obedience but he
[50:08] wants obedience out of a pure heart he
[50:12] does want OB be God's law is not just
[50:14] subject for our whims and our fancies
[50:16] and the way we feel and more conven I
[50:19] mean we can't take this subject that I'm
[50:20] teaching now and say oh man that's
[50:22] complicated that's too hard and I I I
[50:25] don't know what to do so I'm going to
[50:26] take the easier Road and God knows your
[50:30] heart God knows that manipulation in the
[50:33] heart saying brother brother Chad said
[50:36] oh sometimes you get stuck between two
[50:37] things you don't know what to do Hey
[50:39] listen sometimes you know exactly what
[50:41] to do the thing that slays your flesh
[50:44] that kills you that cost you something
[50:47] that's what God's asking you to do amen
[50:49] but we always take The Road Less
[50:50] Traveled God discerns that heart yeah
[50:53] God requires obedience he demands
[50:56] obedience and all of his word is
[51:01] obligatory what do you mean brother Chad
[51:03] we're obligated to keep it God never
[51:06] gave us a command he never taught us a
[51:08] Doctrine amen so that we could take it
[51:09] or leave
[51:10] it all of God's word is obligatory
[51:16] amen but you could obey everything and
[51:19] still be
[51:21] wrong comes down to a Razor's Edge
[51:24] friends
[51:26] it's a matter of the
[51:29] heart the only security we have is in
[51:32] Christ am and a personal revelation of
[51:37] Jesus Christ revealed personally to you
[51:39] amen that's the new birth that's our
[51:43] security let's go to Matthew chapter
[51:54] 12
[51:59] Matthew chapter
[52:02] 12 and we're going to start at verse
[52:07] one at that time Jesus went on the
[52:09] Sabbath day through the corn and his
[52:11] disciples were hunger and began to pluck
[52:14] the ears of corn and eat but when the
[52:17] Pharisees saw it they said unto them
[52:18] Behold thy disciples do that which is
[52:20] not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day
[52:23] but he said unto them have you not read
[52:25] what David did when he was a hungered
[52:28] and they that were with him how he
[52:30] entered into the house of God and did
[52:31] eat the shoe bread which was not lawful
[52:34] for him to
[52:36] eat wait a
[52:41] second David disobeyed the
[52:47] law and Jesus is not condemning
[52:51] him he did that which was not lawful to
[52:57] do and Jesus is using this as an example
[53:00] of why his disciples can pluck corn on
[53:02] the Sabbath and eat
[53:05] it now let's read this again verse four
[53:09] how he entered into the house of God and
[53:10] did eat the shoe bread which was not
[53:12] lawful for him to eat neither for them
[53:14] that were with him but only for the
[53:18] priests verse five or have you not read
[53:21] in the law how that on the Sabbath days
[53:22] the priest in the temple profane the
[53:24] Sabbath and are
[53:26] blameless he said you're trying to hold
[53:29] us to a Sabbath to a Sabbath law that
[53:31] it's a day of rest and it was an
[53:33] ordinance that God gave it was one of
[53:34] the Ten Commandments amen man was
[53:37] subject to that and and intended to obey
[53:39] it I mean in the Old Testament there was
[53:41] a man we saw stoned to death because he
[53:44] didn't keep the
[53:45] Sabbath according to God God told Moses
[53:48] Moses said what should we do with this
[53:49] man and they said have him stoned to
[53:51] death so God is not flexible on his his
[53:55] word it's not it's not like God doesn't
[53:57] care if you keep it or not but here we
[53:59] come to the Sabbath and now they're
[54:01] walking along the field we don't know
[54:03] what the situation is they may not have
[54:05] eaten all day they they they they
[54:07] they're hunger they're just grabbing
[54:09] amen fistfuls of whatever it would be
[54:11] barley or oats or wheat and then just
[54:13] grinding it in their hand and blowing
[54:15] away the chaff and popping the Grain in
[54:16] their mouth and eating the corn as they
[54:19] go through and just as they're walking
[54:21] along and they said your disciples are
[54:23] doing that which is not long awful to do
[54:25] on the Sabbath day and and he goes right
[54:28] to David he said do you not know have
[54:31] you not read that which David did when
[54:33] David ate the shoe bread which was not
[54:35] lawful for them to eat I can imagine the
[54:38] Pharisees sitting there I I mean you
[54:40] talk about a mental nuclear meltdown
[54:42] what do you do with this like I don't I
[54:45] don't even know we're talking about the
[54:46] Sabbath we're not even talking about
[54:48] David and and we're not talking about
[54:50] going to the temple and eating shoe
[54:51] bread we're talking about plucking corn
[54:53] as you walk through the field hi how do
[54:55] you even reconcile this because the
[54:57] Pharisees were playing by A
[55:00] playbook right they were playing the
[55:03] religious game by A
[55:05] playbook and they had manipulated The
[55:07] Playbook and they had they had figured
[55:09] out and they had workarounds built into
[55:11] to all kinds of different things and
[55:13] they were playing by A playbook but
[55:15] Jesus wasn't playing by A playbook
[55:17] because the author was in him amen amen
[55:20] the author of the word and himm were one
[55:23] he knew the intent that that was written
[55:25] for and he knew that the disciples
[55:27] walking along Gathering that corn and
[55:30] eating it was not a violation of God's
[55:33] mind on Sabbath yeah that's amen right
[55:36] and in order to to help them understand
[55:39] amen he didn't say well you know it's
[55:41] only this much weight and Grain and God
[55:43] said he just said why don't you go back
[55:45] and read the Bible and find out amen
[55:48] David it wasn't even lawful he him or
[55:50] the men that were with him he was the
[55:52] king amen but he had Soldiers with him
[55:55] amen and they went they went into the
[55:56] house of God Amen and they ate the
[55:58] showbread what which is not lawful for
[56:01] them to do and Jesus throws this as an
[56:03] example of why it's okay that they did
[56:06] what they
[56:07] did can you see how dangerous this can
[56:10] be if somebody doesn't fear
[56:13] God you can take a principle like that
[56:16] if you don't have a life consecrated to
[56:18] Jesus Christ you can take that principle
[56:20] and you can find any example in the
[56:22] Bible and you can make all kinds of
[56:23] excuses well didn't you read about what
[56:25] Rahab did and didn't you read
[56:32] about oh you're talking about getting
[56:34] down to nitty-gritty
[56:39] now there are some things that only God
[56:43] can
[56:46] judge amen we'll never figure them
[56:49] out too complicated too
[56:52] complex it takes the one who judges the
[56:54] heart heart and the Reigns that'll sort
[56:57] this
[56:58] out let's go to Luke 13 we're going to
[57:01] stay here in the gospel for just a
[57:03] little
[57:19] bit Luke
[57:23] 13:10 and he was teaching in one of the
[57:26] synagogues on the Sabbath and behold
[57:28] there was a woman which had a spirit of
[57:29] infirmity 18 years and was bowed
[57:32] together and could in no wise lift up
[57:34] herself and when Jesus saw her he called
[57:37] her to him and said unto Heroman Thou
[57:39] Art loose from thine
[57:40] infirmity and he laid his hands on her
[57:42] and immediately she was made straight
[57:44] and glorified God and the ruler of the
[57:47] synagogue answered with in
[57:50] indignation he was upset and he was
[57:53] offended because that Jesus had healed
[57:56] on the Sabbath day and said unto the
[57:58] people there are six days in which men
[58:00] ought to work and in them therefore in
[58:03] them therefore uh come and be healed and
[58:06] not on the Sabbath
[58:08] day what a
[58:10] priest the Lord then answered him and
[58:12] said thou hypocrite do not each one of
[58:15] you on his Sabbath loose his ox or his
[58:17] ass from the stall and leadth him away
[58:19] to to the watering and ought not this
[58:22] woman being a daughter of Abraham
[58:25] whom Satan hath bound low these 18 years
[58:27] be loosed from this bound this Bond on
[58:31] the Sabbath day and when he had said
[58:33] these things all his adversaries were
[58:35] ashamed and all the people rejoiced for
[58:37] all the Glorious things that were done
[58:40] by
[58:41] him what a
[58:45] scripture Jesus looks at a woman who's
[58:48] Bound for 18
[58:50] years and tells her to be loose and
[58:53] stretch forth her hand and her hand
[58:55] which is withered is made whole and the
[58:57] only thing the priest can think is you
[58:59] can't do that on the Sabbath
[59:01] day
[59:05] right he was right in one way but he was
[59:09] wrong in the most important
[59:12] way he was right in keeping a
[59:15] Sabbath he was right in honoring God he
[59:18] was right that you should honor God and
[59:21] keep the word but he was completely
[59:24] wrong in what the Sabbath was actually
[59:26] intended for and God's heart behind the
[59:29] Commandment he got the letter but he
[59:32] completely missed the spirit let's go to
[59:34] John chapter
[59:48] 7 John chapter
[59:51] 7 let's look at verse 21
[59:57] Jesus answered and said unto them I have
[59:59] done one work and you all Marvel Moses
[1:00:02] therefore gave unto you circumcision not
[1:00:04] because it is of Moses but of the
[1:00:05] fathers and ye on the Sabbath day
[1:00:08] circumcise a man of a man on the Sabbath
[1:00:11] they receive circumcision that the law
[1:00:12] of Moses should not be broken are you
[1:00:14] angry at me because I have made a man
[1:00:16] everywh whole on the Sabbath day judge
[1:00:19] not according to the appearance but
[1:00:21] judge righteous
[1:00:22] judgment so Jesus saying you you you
[1:00:25] guys are your judgment is all obscure
[1:00:28] you're you're you're so Twisted in your
[1:00:30] judgment because he is made a man this
[1:00:33] is another situation where he healed
[1:00:35] somebody on the Sabbath day and they
[1:00:37] they're coming against him and but he
[1:00:39] said but he points right back to the law
[1:00:41] and he says yeah you're not supposed to
[1:00:43] do any surval work you're not but but
[1:00:45] earlier he said but the priest in the
[1:00:48] temple defile the Sabbath because
[1:00:51] they're
[1:00:52] working they're slaying they're SA
[1:00:54] sacrificing they're offering the morning
[1:00:56] oblation and the evening oblation
[1:00:57] they're offering sacrifice the priests
[1:00:59] are actually defiling the Sabbath
[1:01:02] because they're doing that which is
[1:01:03] contrary to the Sabbath but why are they
[1:01:06] doing it because Moses told them to do
[1:01:08] it amen they're stuck between two
[1:01:11] Commandments and now there's another
[1:01:13] Commandment that you must if you have a
[1:01:15] male child that child must be
[1:01:16] circumcised on the eth day and it
[1:01:18] doesn't matter what day he's born on he
[1:01:20] has to be circumcised on the eighth day
[1:01:22] and if circumcision Falls on the seventh
[1:01:25] day if it falls on Sabbath Saturday then
[1:01:27] he's got to be circumcised causing the
[1:01:29] priest to work and and all of the he's
[1:01:31] doing a he's doing a minor medical Pro
[1:01:36] procedure and Jesus is trying to show
[1:01:38] them that you don't even understand what
[1:01:40] you're talking about he said don't judge
[1:01:42] by outward appearance but judge
[1:01:44] righteous
[1:01:45] judgment that doesn't mean now that
[1:01:48] didn't mean for them that Jesus was
[1:01:50] saying don't even worry about the
[1:01:51] Sabbath now you can do whatever you want
[1:01:53] that's also not what he's saying
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:58] amen praise
[1:02:00] God let's go to Mark chapter
[1:02:16] 2 Mark chapter
[1:02:19] 2 verse 27 Mark 2 verse
[1:02:23] 27
[1:02:28] says and he said unto them the Sabbath
[1:02:31] was made for man and not man for the
[1:02:34] Sabbath therefore the son of man is Lord
[1:02:36] also of the Sabbath he's show them you
[1:02:40] what they were doing listen they were
[1:02:43] bringing control and bondage to People
[1:02:46] by the word of
[1:02:49] God but he says you don't even
[1:02:51] understand the Sabbath the Sabbath was
[1:02:53] given for man man man was not given for
[1:02:55] the Sabbath the Sabbath was not to rule
[1:02:58] over the man the man was the Sabbath was
[1:03:00] to benefit the man the man's not the
[1:03:02] benefit the Sabbath the Sabbath isn't
[1:03:04] the object the man's the object God gave
[1:03:06] him a day of rest in commemoration of
[1:03:09] God's rest he gave him a day of rest
[1:03:11] amen for the benefit of the man not for
[1:03:14] the benefit of the
[1:03:16] Sabbath so listen it wasn't for the
[1:03:18] benefit if we could say the rule or the
[1:03:20] law okay I'm going to say a rule I hate
[1:03:23] to say that because it's just God it's
[1:03:26] just God's commandment it's God's nature
[1:03:28] it's God's word but the rule was given
[1:03:30] to bless the man the man's not there to
[1:03:33] keep the
[1:03:45] rule God has come and restored his word
[1:03:48] in this end time and he showed us how to
[1:03:51] live how to dress how to talk amen where
[1:03:54] to go where not to go the kind of
[1:03:57] establishments to stay out of the kind
[1:03:59] of relationships to
[1:04:03] avoid who did he do it
[1:04:05] for he did it for
[1:04:08] us he did it for our benefit for our
[1:04:13] welfare to stay out of dangerous
[1:04:15] situations to keep from compromised
[1:04:17] positions to keep from our spirituality
[1:04:20] being Stripped Away to keep our mind
[1:04:22] from being confused and our bodies from
[1:04:23] being filed amen taught us not to smoke
[1:04:27] or
[1:04:30] drink
[1:04:32] listen he never did it to bring a group
[1:04:35] of people under bondage to the ordinance
[1:04:39] he did it to keep a group of people free
[1:04:41] from the world Amen right
[1:04:48] right let's go to Mark
[1:04:53] 3:4
[1:04:56] Mark
[1:04:58] 3:4 and he saith unto them is it lawful
[1:05:02] to do good on the Sabbath day or to do
[1:05:04] evil to save life or to
[1:05:08] kill what a good
[1:05:13] question is it lawful to drive the speed
[1:05:15] limit and let somebody bleed to death in
[1:05:17] your
[1:05:20] car what a good
[1:05:22] question is is that the right thing to
[1:05:25] do because we don't want to break the
[1:05:27] speed limit
[1:05:29] law or is it right to get to the
[1:05:32] hospital as fast as you can without
[1:05:33] harming
[1:05:35] anybody to drive as safely as you can as
[1:05:38] fast as you can safe so you still in the
[1:05:40] spirit of law you're not coming harm or
[1:05:41] injury to anybody inside your car or
[1:05:43] outside of your
[1:05:48] car we we might find ourselves in more
[1:05:52] of these situations as as time goes
[1:05:55] on and we're going to have to have the
[1:05:57] fear of God on the inside we're going to
[1:06:00] have to have a respect for God and a
[1:06:01] respect for his word and there's going
[1:06:04] to have to be death to self to selfish
[1:06:06] motives to Pride to self-preservation
[1:06:09] there's no way listen there's no way
[1:06:11] this is going to work
[1:06:14] religiously there's no way this is going
[1:06:16] to work Loosely this is only going to
[1:06:18] work when somebody is connected to
[1:06:20] almighty God and completely sold out
[1:06:23] that's only way to serve god with a pure
[1:06:27] heart
[1:06:29] amen I want to read to you out of Joel I
[1:06:31] want you to stay here where you at in
[1:06:32] your Bibles because we're going to go to
[1:06:33] Matthew next but Joel 2:12 you can jot
[1:06:36] this scripture down Joel
[1:06:39] 2:12 says therefore also now sayith the
[1:06:43] Lord turn ye even to me with all your
[1:06:45] heart and with fasting and with weeping
[1:06:46] and with mourning and Rend your heart
[1:06:49] and not your garments and turn unto the
[1:06:51] Lord your God for he is gracious and
[1:06:53] merciful will slow to anger and of great
[1:06:55] kindness and repenteth him of
[1:06:57] evil it's amazing how he's saying Turn
[1:07:01] even to me with your heart with fastings
[1:07:03] with weeping with mourning because
[1:07:05] there's a tradition uh with the Jews
[1:07:07] whenever they they they would contact
[1:07:09] certain extreme things and emotion amen
[1:07:12] they would rent their garment so when
[1:07:14] they would fall into despair when
[1:07:16] everything would go wrong they'd rip
[1:07:17] their garment when they would face
[1:07:18] Abomination against the word of God they
[1:07:20] would rip their garment but he's saying
[1:07:22] turn to me
[1:07:24] even to me with all your heart with
[1:07:26] fasting with weeping with mourning en
[1:07:28] ringe your heart not your garment don't
[1:07:31] just go through the motions don't just
[1:07:33] get emotional don't just show everybody
[1:07:35] else that I'm in distress but no Rin
[1:07:37] your heart tear your heart and come to
[1:07:39] him with prayer and fastings and Mourns
[1:07:41] and weepings amen not with the outward
[1:07:44] show and the outward display but get
[1:07:46] down real on the inside and Rin your
[1:07:48] heart and not your
[1:07:50] garments
[1:07:52] amen sometimes times I question I
[1:07:55] question myself why do we do some of the
[1:07:57] things we do that's a good question to
[1:08:00] ask yourself sometime why am I doing why
[1:08:03] am I doing what I'm doing am I doing it
[1:08:06] for the right reasons that's a good
[1:08:09] question and only you can answer it and
[1:08:11] you know why I say that only you can
[1:08:13] answer but really only God can answer it
[1:08:14] cuz sometimes you don't even
[1:08:17] know I've had times in my life where I
[1:08:20] get down the road a little further and I
[1:08:22] look back and I realize I was wrong
[1:08:24] my motive was wrong my desire was wrong
[1:08:27] but at that time I was blinded to it I
[1:08:29] thought I was doing right but a little
[1:08:30] bit further down the road and a little
[1:08:32] bit more growth and a little more
[1:08:34] experience and making a mistake the same
[1:08:35] time a few times you look back and say
[1:08:38] no I I thought I was righteous and I
[1:08:40] thought I was standing on the word and I
[1:08:42] thought nope that was me I was defending
[1:08:45] myself and I was uh defending my honor
[1:08:48] my pride my whatever I was doing I was
[1:08:50] doing it for the wrong reasons amen
[1:08:52] sometimes we we don't even know
[1:08:54] sometimes what our own motive are is
[1:08:57] because the heart is deceitfully wicked
[1:08:59] Above All Things who can know it amen I
[1:09:01] tell you who can know it the word can
[1:09:03] know it amen because the word is a
[1:09:04] person and that word can divide Soul and
[1:09:07] Spirit and divide amen the heart and and
[1:09:10] the and give you the
[1:09:12] intent of the
[1:09:15] heart amen we need the person of the
[1:09:19] word Matthew 15
[1:09:22] ver1
[1:09:25] Matthew 15:1 then came to Jesus scribes
[1:09:28] and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem
[1:09:30] saying why do thy disciples transgress
[1:09:33] the tradition of the elders for they
[1:09:34] wash not their hands when they eat bread
[1:09:37] but he answered and said unto them why
[1:09:39] do you also transgress the Commandment
[1:09:41] of God by your tradition for God
[1:09:44] commandeth saying honor thy father and
[1:09:45] mother and he that curses father or
[1:09:48] mother let him die the death but you say
[1:09:51] whosoever shall say to his father or to
[1:09:53] his mother it is a gift by whatsoever
[1:09:55] thou mightest be profited by me and
[1:09:57] honor not his father or his mother he
[1:10:00] shall be free thus have you made the
[1:10:03] Commandment of God of none effect by
[1:10:05] your
[1:10:06] tradition ye Hypocrites well did
[1:10:09] Isaiah's prophesied of you saying this
[1:10:10] people draw nigh unto me with their
[1:10:12] mouth and honor me with their lips but
[1:10:14] their heart is far from me but in vain
[1:10:17] they do worship me teaching for
[1:10:20] doctrines the Commandments of men I
[1:10:22] didn't quite understand what the
[1:10:25] scripture was saying about honoring thy
[1:10:28] father or thy mother and you're saying
[1:10:30] to them uh verse 5 whosoever to say to
[1:10:33] his father or his mother it is a gift by
[1:10:35] whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
[1:10:37] me and honth not thy father or his
[1:10:40] mother he shall be free thus have you
[1:10:42] made the Commandment of God none effect
[1:10:45] the commandment to honor their mother
[1:10:47] and father was mean to take care of them
[1:10:50] to provide for them in their old
[1:10:52] age and so I went and I studied and I
[1:10:55] tried to find out and the best answer I
[1:10:57] can get what I believe to be
[1:10:59] true is if they would dedicate their
[1:11:02] property and dedicate their land and
[1:11:04] dedicate it to the temple for their
[1:11:06] passing it's a gift then they could keep
[1:11:09] it and all the prophets to themselves
[1:11:11] because it's dedicated to the temple and
[1:11:13] they didn't have to share it with their
[1:11:17] parents that's why you say it's a gift
[1:11:20] by what you could be profited by me and
[1:11:23] what did the Pharisees do they made a
[1:11:25] religious
[1:11:26] workaround and missed the whole Spirit
[1:11:30] of what God was telling them God was
[1:11:32] saying your parents took care of you
[1:11:34] when you were young you take care of
[1:11:36] them pretty simple amen but in order to
[1:11:39] keep their finances keep their property
[1:11:41] and keep everything they came up with a
[1:11:42] scheme whereby they didn't have to honor
[1:11:45] their mother and father and they could
[1:11:46] stay free and still say in the good
[1:11:48] circles the religious circles and they
[1:11:50] look fine because what did they do they
[1:11:51] had offered some gift or made some
[1:11:53] dedication and I don't know how it
[1:11:54] worked and I don't know what it was but
[1:11:56] they had worked a work around and they
[1:11:58] made the Commandment of none effect by
[1:12:00] their
[1:12:03] tradition say God help us never to do a
[1:12:06] thing like
[1:12:07] that help us to never find a
[1:12:10] workaround but help us to find the heart
[1:12:13] of the commandment and we find the heart
[1:12:15] of the author and the Heart of the
[1:12:17] commandment and give our whole lives to
[1:12:19] that amen give our whole selves to to
[1:12:23] finding out what is it that God wants
[1:12:25] what is it he's pleased with what is it
[1:12:27] he desires why did he give this
[1:12:29] commandment why did he share this word
[1:12:31] with us why has He restored the word in
[1:12:33] the end time and brought us back to the
[1:12:34] faith of the fathers it's not for me to
[1:12:36] manipulate it again like every other
[1:12:38] denomination did or pass it away or to
[1:12:40] create another strict structure with it
[1:12:43] amen that won't work amen what did he do
[1:12:46] he came back to unveil the author so
[1:12:48] that you could have the mind of the
[1:12:49] author so that you could read the word
[1:12:51] so that you could hear the prophet and
[1:12:53] you could understand what he's saying
[1:12:55] and what his desire is and how he wants
[1:12:57] us to live and how we can be the
[1:12:59] reflection of Jesus Christ on this Earth
[1:13:01] by what by keeping his
[1:13:06] word
[1:13:08] amen when Adam and Eve fell what's the
[1:13:12] first thing they did they made fig
[1:13:14] leaves to cover their nakedness to cover
[1:13:16] the fall brother bam tells us they made
[1:13:18] their own
[1:13:20] religion so that they could feel better
[1:13:22] so that they could feel covered amen and
[1:13:24] that's exactly what religion does
[1:13:26] religion covers
[1:13:29] sin fig Lea religion false religion it
[1:13:33] covers sins it makes people comfortable
[1:13:36] living in compromise but they feel
[1:13:38] secure because of
[1:13:41] religion we've all seen it amen we may
[1:13:44] have all experienced it we may all be
[1:13:45] guilty of it in one way or
[1:13:49] another but I want to read to you what
[1:13:51] brother bham said
[1:13:54] amen he said now listen this is in the
[1:13:56] message Fellowship now listen as I close
[1:13:59] when man lost his Fellowship in the
[1:14:01] Garden of Eden by sin what did God do
[1:14:03] about it look what man done about it
[1:14:05] instead of coming out and being honest
[1:14:06] and saying father I sin he went back in
[1:14:08] the bushes and formed himself a
[1:14:10] religious organization and made himself
[1:14:12] a covering religion means covering he
[1:14:14] made himself a man-made religion made
[1:14:16] him an apron out of leaves fig leaves
[1:14:18] the Bible said so but he when he come
[1:14:21] face to face when he come to face God he
[1:14:23] realized that his man-made religion
[1:14:25] wouldn't work and neither will anybody
[1:14:28] else you've got to come to to you got to
[1:14:31] come on God's basis he said again in the
[1:14:35] message in 1954 the unconditional
[1:14:37] Covenant now we know the world religion
[1:14:39] the word religion means covering and
[1:14:41] Adam instead of saying God cover me he
[1:14:43] made himself some aprons out of fig
[1:14:45] leaves he and Eve and they worked all
[1:14:47] right as long as God wasn't
[1:14:50] around yes right woo
[1:14:55] oh my goodness religion will work all
[1:14:57] right as long as God doesn't come on the
[1:14:59] scene remember when they made their fig
[1:15:01] Leaf religion amen they had their aprons
[1:15:03] of fig leaes they were fine with it
[1:15:05] until they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:15:08] come walking in the garden and when they
[1:15:09] heard the voice of the Lord they went
[1:15:11] and hid themselves amen they knew when
[1:15:14] God came down they knew that those fig
[1:15:17] leaves didn't cover anything they
[1:15:19] couldn't hide be behind him and he said
[1:15:22] it worked all right as as long as God
[1:15:23] wasn't around but when they come in the
[1:15:25] presence of God they realized that their
[1:15:27] fig Leaf religion wouldn't work and
[1:15:29] brother there's so much of that today
[1:15:31] I'm afraid that you're going to find the
[1:15:33] same thing when God comes again that
[1:15:35] homemade fig Leaf religion won't stand
[1:15:38] in the presence of
[1:15:40] God that's still the
[1:15:43] truth amen it's still the truth our our
[1:15:46] religious Notions and our coverings and
[1:15:48] our workaround programs won't stand in
[1:15:51] the face of God Amen what is it that we
[1:15:53] need more than anything I'll tell you
[1:15:55] what we need more than anything we need
[1:15:56] a prayer life amen we need a dedicated
[1:15:59] consecrated prayer life we need to spend
[1:16:01] time in the presence of God and let God
[1:16:03] that search light of God's presence
[1:16:05] search out our heart and show us where
[1:16:07] we're not meeting where we're failing
[1:16:09] amen because we've got to come into His
[1:16:11] presence for us to realize I'm
[1:16:15] naked that's what that's Adam said he
[1:16:17] says he says Adam where are thou he says
[1:16:20] I I hid myself because I was naked he
[1:16:22] said who told you you were naked
[1:16:24] technically he wasn't naked he had an
[1:16:26] apron on but that apron was nothing in
[1:16:30] the face of God in the presence of God
[1:16:32] it might as well been transparent it
[1:16:34] worked before man it worked in the
[1:16:36] natural but it did not work in the
[1:16:38] presence of God and neither will none of
[1:16:40] our religion work in the presence of God
[1:16:42] that's why we need to be in the presence
[1:16:44] of God we need to be in Fellowship we
[1:16:46] need to be in our anointed preaching we
[1:16:48] need to hear the voice in this hour of
[1:16:49] the Prophet we need to have a prayer
[1:16:51] life and stay consecrated stay on our
[1:16:53] knees because if not we're going to move
[1:16:55] into religion and stay comfortable
[1:16:57] because we've not moved into the
[1:16:58] presence of
[1:17:03] God we don't need less of it we need
[1:17:09] more praise be to
[1:17:13] God
[1:17:18] Amen let's go to Matthew
[1:17:22] 23
[1:17:43] Matthew 23 verse
[1:17:45] 1 then spake Jesus to the multitude and
[1:17:49] to his disciples saying the scribes and
[1:17:51] the Pharisees sit in Moses seat and all
[1:17:54] therefore whatsoever they bid You
[1:17:56] observe that observe and do but do not
[1:17:59] after their works for they say and do
[1:18:01] not for they bind heavy burdens and
[1:18:03] Grievious to be born and lay them on
[1:18:05] men's shoulders but they themselves will
[1:18:07] not move them with one of their fingers
[1:18:09] but all their Works they do for to be
[1:18:11] seen of men and they make broad their
[1:18:13] felies and enlarge the borders of their
[1:18:15] garments and love the uppermost rooms at
[1:18:18] feast and the chief seats in the
[1:18:19] synagogues and greetings in the markets
[1:18:22] and to be called of men Rabbi
[1:18:26] Rabbi Jesus is unveiling the heart of
[1:18:29] the Pharisee the the phes heart isn't
[1:18:32] centered on God his desire isn't to
[1:18:35] please God his keeping of his laws and
[1:18:38] his strict ordinance wasn't to please
[1:18:40] God because that's that's not whose
[1:18:42] pleasure he
[1:18:44] sought that's not whose approval he was
[1:18:47] seeking he wasn't seeking God's approval
[1:18:50] he wasn't seeking God's pleasure he was
[1:18:52] seeking his own pleasure pleasure and he
[1:18:53] was seeking man's approval so all of his
[1:18:55] ordinances and all of his keeping of
[1:18:57] ordinance was for his own pleasure and
[1:18:59] for man's
[1:19:00] approval that's a
[1:19:03] Pharisee brother Bram said in the
[1:19:05] message God had explained he said I want
[1:19:06] to say that I believe that both sides
[1:19:08] are wrong as long as they argue one with
[1:19:10] another he's talking about two ministers
[1:19:12] and an argument that was going on in
[1:19:13] Texas amen between a Oneness and an
[1:19:16] Assemblies of God Minister he said I
[1:19:18] believe their both sides are wrong as
[1:19:19] long as they argue one with the other
[1:19:21] because their motives is wrong
[1:19:23] and as long as your motives is wrong no
[1:19:25] matter what your objective is but your
[1:19:28] motive to that objective is wrong then
[1:19:30] it'll never
[1:19:32] work what was their objective in this
[1:19:35] argument their objective was to have the
[1:19:37] truth of the word of God one was Oneness
[1:19:40] one was assemblies but their motive for
[1:19:43] doing it was wrong their objective was
[1:19:44] to have the truth but their motive was
[1:19:47] to serve their own idea amen their own
[1:19:50] denomination their own idea and because
[1:19:53] the motive was wrong brother bham said
[1:19:55] no matter how good your objective is if
[1:19:56] your motive is wrong it won't work out
[1:19:58] right why because the motive of the
[1:20:00] heart is wrong you're doing it for the
[1:20:02] wrong
[1:20:04] reasons so I'll just rehearse this you
[1:20:07] can do the wrong thing for the right
[1:20:11] reasons and you can do the right thing
[1:20:13] for the wrong
[1:20:16] reasons so where do we want to be I want
[1:20:19] to do the right things for the right
[1:20:20] reasons that's where I want to be
[1:20:24] let's go to uh look here further in 23
[1:20:27] 23:23 Matthew
[1:20:30] 23:23 says woe unto you scribes and
[1:20:33] Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe
[1:20:35] of men and Anis and cing and have
[1:20:38] omitted the weightier matters of the law
[1:20:41] judgment mercy and
[1:20:44] Faith these ought you to have done and
[1:20:47] not to leave the other
[1:20:50] undone he's not saying don't pay your
[1:20:53] ties yeah now look he says you pay
[1:20:57] ties of mint and
[1:20:59] Anis and cumin what is that those are
[1:21:04] herbs and
[1:21:06] spices so let's just if you will with me
[1:21:10] let's just get a picture of this maybe
[1:21:13] they're growing in their garden and
[1:21:14] they've got a little Garden on the side
[1:21:16] of their house and their wife has a
[1:21:18] little kitchen garden and she's growing
[1:21:20] some mint she's growing some hum and
[1:21:23] she's growing some of these spices that
[1:21:25] they use in cooking they're so careful
[1:21:28] about the law of tithe that even these
[1:21:30] little plants that are growing they're
[1:21:33] tithing off the
[1:21:38] mint you get the
[1:21:40] picture how many of you have grown mint
[1:21:42] in your garden I mean just one little
[1:21:44] plant is
[1:21:46] sufficient how much would a tithe off of
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:50] be praise God maybe they grew a whole
[1:21:52] Year's worth and they had but they were
[1:21:54] so worried about tithing the the spices
[1:21:58] and the tithing these things but he says
[1:22:00] you did that and he says you shouldn't
[1:22:02] leave that undone that's good because
[1:22:03] that's the law you should do that but
[1:22:05] you've left the weightier matters of the
[1:22:07] law what was the weightier matters of
[1:22:09] the law the weightier matters of the law
[1:22:11] are the things that's not easy to make a
[1:22:13] rule about yeah what are the weightier
[1:22:17] matters of the law judgment mercy and
[1:22:20] Faith how do you measure that amen how
[1:22:23] do you put that on a scale how do you
[1:22:25] get a tenth of that how do you measure
[1:22:27] that they're doing all the outward
[1:22:29] things and the outside things and and
[1:22:31] they're so careful about keeping the law
[1:22:33] for certain things but the the real
[1:22:35] weightier matters of the law the real
[1:22:36] meat of it the real reason God gave the
[1:22:39] word is so that we can learn judgment
[1:22:41] mercy and faith and they were forsaking
[1:22:43] that and fiddling around with trying to
[1:22:45] keep some
[1:22:47] mint for a
[1:22:48] tithe and they weren't wrong in doing
[1:22:51] that they were wrong and focusing on
[1:22:53] that and forgetting the weightier
[1:22:54] matters of the
[1:22:57] law verse 24 you blind guides which
[1:23:00] strain at a knot and swallow a
[1:23:03] camel you
[1:23:05] know Jesus wasn't always the sweetest
[1:23:09] talking minister in the
[1:23:12] world sometimes Jesus is painted as this
[1:23:15] sweet old grandpa and just a
[1:23:17] softspoken boy I'm telling you the
[1:23:20] Pharisees didn't think so I told I'm
[1:23:22] going to say you blind guides which
[1:23:25] strain at a knat and swallow a camel woe
[1:23:27] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:23:29] Hypocrites for you make clean the
[1:23:31] outside of the cup and of the platter
[1:23:32] but within they are full of extortion
[1:23:34] and excess Thou blind Pharisees cleanse
[1:23:38] first that which is within the cup and
[1:23:39] the platter that the outside of them may
[1:23:42] be clean also woe unto you scribes and
[1:23:44] Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like
[1:23:46] and dewied sepers which indeed appear
[1:23:48] beautiful outward but are within full of
[1:23:50] dead men's bones and of all uncleanness
[1:23:53] even so you also outwardly appear
[1:23:55] righteous unto men but within you are
[1:23:57] full of hypocrisy and
[1:24:00] iniquity boy Jesus called it
[1:24:05] out you
[1:24:08] know they were so right but they were so
[1:24:11] wrong and exactly the same
[1:24:13] time because they missed the heart of it
[1:24:17] they got some things and and brother
[1:24:20] Jesus never condemned them for those
[1:24:22] things what he condemned them for was
[1:24:24] missing the real weightier matters the
[1:24:26] real heart of the law God gave them a
[1:24:29] law to expose the fallacy of man and to
[1:24:32] show the nature of
[1:24:33] God and they took it and they made
[1:24:36] something that served
[1:24:39] themselves my goodness help us God it's
[1:24:43] all I can say is help us
[1:24:45] God
[1:24:47] now when we look at Adam and Eve we know
[1:24:50] the scripture tell us that Adam was was
[1:24:52] not deceived that's in 1 Timothy 213 if
[1:24:55] you want to write it down for Adam was
[1:24:58] first formed in Eve Adam was not
[1:25:00] deceived but the woman being deceived
[1:25:02] was in the
[1:25:03] transgression and here's what the
[1:25:05] prophet says here in 1955 he says now it
[1:25:09] was said that thought that I said that
[1:25:11] Adam hadn't sinned Adam was sinned and
[1:25:14] condemned and was driven from the Garden
[1:25:16] of Eden by God the Redemption robe over
[1:25:18] him showed that well what I said that
[1:25:21] Adam sinned willfully
[1:25:23] Eve was actually deceived but Adam was
[1:25:25] not deceived he deliberately sinned
[1:25:27] deliberately sinned knowing what he was
[1:25:29] doing because of his wife he took
[1:25:31] position with his wife then they went
[1:25:33] before God and both of them was
[1:25:35] condemned again in another message in
[1:25:37] 1957 he said the Bible said that Adam
[1:25:40] was not deceived Adam was not deceived
[1:25:42] he know just exactly what he was doing
[1:25:44] he because of the love that he had for
[1:25:46] Eve he walked right out into death with
[1:25:48] her not because he had to he know
[1:25:51] differently Eve was absolutely deceived
[1:25:53] she thought she was right but Adam
[1:25:55] knowed better but he walked out with her
[1:25:57] and took death with
[1:25:59] her oh
[1:26:02] my I want to I just want to propose I
[1:26:05] want to pose a question to
[1:26:08] you did Adam do the wrong
[1:26:16] thing did Adam
[1:26:18] sin did he transgress the word of God
[1:26:21] was he condemned judged for
[1:26:24] it is it possible that Adam did the
[1:26:27] wrong thing for the right
[1:26:33] reason he was foreshadowing the coming
[1:26:36] of
[1:26:38] Christ for the love of his wife for the
[1:26:41] love of him his wife she was part of him
[1:26:45] he went with
[1:26:46] her he failed the word of God he wasn't
[1:26:50] deceived he wasn't was n deceived in the
[1:26:52] transgression no he knew exactly what he
[1:26:54] was doing he did it intentionally and he
[1:26:56] did it on purpose this was premeditated
[1:27:03] sin I don't know how to change the
[1:27:07] Bible he did the wrong thing but I
[1:27:09] believe he did it for the right
[1:27:11] reason was he justified in it no he was
[1:27:15] condemned but God came down and offered
[1:27:17] a substitutionary
[1:27:19] lamb so that he could redeem back his
[1:27:21] son foreshadowing that there's another
[1:27:23] lamb coming to pay for what was done
[1:27:25] here
[1:27:26] today he did the wrong thing it was
[1:27:29] wrong you can't make it you can't say it
[1:27:30] was the right thing it was the wrong
[1:27:32] thing but in some way it was still the
[1:27:34] right thing because what was Christ was
[1:27:36] going to do for his wife he was going to
[1:27:38] come down and go with her amen and take
[1:27:40] on her wrong even though he never became
[1:27:42] wrong to do that but he took on her
[1:27:44] wrong to redeem her back now Adam come
[1:27:46] down and did wrong to take on her wrong
[1:27:49] that's why he was condemned and Jesus
[1:27:51] wasn't condemned because Jesus never
[1:27:53] transgressed the law So Adam did
[1:27:56] wrong but I believe this is me
[1:27:59] personally you may disagree with me but
[1:28:00] I believe he did wrong for the right
[1:28:03] reason and I believe it fulfilled a
[1:28:05] desire in God so God could manifest
[1:28:08] himself and foreshadow the coming of
[1:28:14] Christ I don't always know how to sort
[1:28:16] all these things
[1:28:19] out David did wrong when he ate the shoe
[1:28:21] bread
[1:28:22] Jesus didn't condemn
[1:28:26] him you know one of the Ten Commandments
[1:28:29] was Thou shalt not
[1:28:31] lie do you agree with me Sunday school
[1:28:34] teachers am I
[1:28:37] right what did Rahab do when the
[1:28:39] soldiers came looking for the
[1:28:51] spies
[1:28:53] what did Elisha do with the Syrian
[1:29:00] Army
[1:29:02] uh I don't know it's just the Bible I
[1:29:06] don't know how to change it I don't know
[1:29:08] how to doctor it up I don't know how to
[1:29:10] put Band-Aids on
[1:29:11] it all I can say is this is what it
[1:29:16] is when Absalom ran David come to
[1:29:19] Jerusalem and David left the throne
[1:29:22] David had an advisor he trusted that
[1:29:24] advisor he trusted come to David and
[1:29:27] said what should I do I will go with you
[1:29:29] he says no you go back and you pretend
[1:29:33] to al Ally
[1:29:35] yourself so you can find out what's
[1:29:37] going on and get me word
[1:29:41] back when Absalon comes into town he
[1:29:44] says oh my my father's friend and
[1:29:46] trusted advisor why aren't you with him
[1:29:48] and he he acts like he's faith in he's
[1:29:53] deceiving like he's supporting Absalon
[1:29:55] and he's saying oh I can see that you're
[1:29:57] Now The King and I offer my services to
[1:30:05] you he was never
[1:30:10] condemned technically he was
[1:30:14] wrong technically ah Rahab was
[1:30:17] wrong technically Elisha was wrong
[1:30:21] technically Tech
[1:30:23] Ally but maybe God's not
[1:30:29] technical just maybe he's not
[1:30:34] technical listen you can see why I feel
[1:30:37] like I'm dancing through landmines and
[1:30:39] why I didn't feel in myself prepared to
[1:30:41] preach this
[1:30:42] message because you can take a message
[1:30:44] like this and you can wre
[1:30:48] Havoc but it's still the
[1:30:50] truth amen you can wreak havoc you can
[1:30:54] you can cause all kinds if it's taken
[1:30:56] with the wrong Spirit and the wrong
[1:30:57] nature it can cause all kinds of
[1:30:59] defilement and unrighteousness and
[1:31:02] lawlessness
[1:31:03] amen but there has to be a bride at the
[1:31:06] end time that has the mind of the author
[1:31:11] there has to be a people that can
[1:31:13] navigate difficult situations there has
[1:31:16] to be a people that can land between two
[1:31:18] Commandments and navigate their way
[1:31:20] through without taking the easy Road
[1:31:23] without serving self without justifying
[1:31:26] wrong action there has to be a people
[1:31:28] who's honest there has to be a people
[1:31:29] who's real there has to be a genuine
[1:31:32] representation of Jesus Christ upon this
[1:31:34] Earth in the end time there has to be a
[1:31:36] people who can walk the razor's
[1:31:38] Edge and I'm not even claiming to be one
[1:31:41] of those people yet but I believe that
[1:31:43] he's going to put me in that position
[1:31:45] because that's what he's called for at
[1:31:46] this end
[1:31:47] time there's got to be a people that can
[1:31:50] look Beyond amen some of the knee-jerk
[1:31:52] reactions and and look to the motive of
[1:31:55] the heart and judge with righteous
[1:31:56] judgment and deal with the weightier
[1:31:59] matters of the
[1:32:04] law praise
[1:32:08] God oh
[1:32:10] friends I don't always
[1:32:13] know I don't always know how to proceed
[1:32:15] I just know how God leads I don't even
[1:32:17] know why like for me I would love to
[1:32:20] button this up so tight and give you the
[1:32:21] parameters on this truth I can't give
[1:32:23] you the parameters on this truth this
[1:32:25] walk of a Christian Life is the most
[1:32:27] dangerous you'll ever walk there's
[1:32:29] pitfalls everywhere there's landmines
[1:32:30] all around you there's millions of ways
[1:32:32] to be completely wrong and there's
[1:32:34] millions of ways to hurt yourself and
[1:32:35] hurt other people there's only one way
[1:32:37] to be right and you've got to be tuned
[1:32:39] in with Christ you have to be in him and
[1:32:41] him in you and you got to be surrendered
[1:32:43] and submitted to that Spirit that's the
[1:32:45] only way we're going to make it we
[1:32:48] listen in all the word that's been
[1:32:49] restored to us and the word has been
[1:32:51] marvelous ly restored to us we've got so
[1:32:53] much word we got the unveiling of the
[1:32:55] word we've been brought back to the
[1:32:57] original doctrine of the Apostles but we
[1:32:59] still find ourselves in situations we
[1:33:01] don't have a clear answer for in the
[1:33:04] under the unveiling of the word under
[1:33:06] the restoration of the doctrine under
[1:33:09] everything that's been put in the right
[1:33:10] place we still sometimes find ourselves
[1:33:13] in situations that I don't know which
[1:33:15] word to
[1:33:17] apply cuz two or three may fit in this
[1:33:19] situation amen that's when you're going
[1:33:22] to have to be led by the
[1:33:28] spirit can it go can we go wrong yeah we
[1:33:31] can go we've always been able to go
[1:33:32] wrong the Pharisees were able to go
[1:33:35] wrong what did they do they took the
[1:33:37] Glorious law which the Apostle Paul
[1:33:41] never condemned the
[1:33:43] law Paul never said the law was bad he
[1:33:45] said the law is
[1:33:47] perfect that's what Paul said but man
[1:33:51] was UN able to keep the law so the law
[1:33:53] was a condemnation for men it was death
[1:33:55] to him not life Grace brought life but
[1:33:59] there was nothing wrong with the law it
[1:34:00] was perfect they took a perfect law
[1:34:02] which was a perfect reflection of God
[1:34:04] which was the mind of God which exposed
[1:34:07] the sin nature of man and and showed the
[1:34:09] righteousness of God they took it and
[1:34:11] they manipulated it to serve their own
[1:34:18] purposes that's what the church ages
[1:34:20] have done with the new test
[1:34:23] they've taken it and manipulated it to
[1:34:25] serve their own
[1:34:27] purposes God forbid that we would take
[1:34:30] the message and manipulate it to serve
[1:34:32] our own
[1:34:33] purposes this message came to free us
[1:34:36] from bondage not to create bondage Amen
[1:34:40] to free us from
[1:34:42] bondage it came to set the captives
[1:34:46] free does that mean that we don't have
[1:34:49] rules absolutely not we believe the word
[1:34:52] of
[1:34:52] God in fact that freedom frees you to
[1:34:56] serve God like you've never served him
[1:34:58] before it frees you it frees you to
[1:35:02] surrender frees you to submit frees you
[1:35:04] to do it from your heart not because of
[1:35:06] a religious order and not because of
[1:35:07] what other people will think of you but
[1:35:09] the reality strikes your heart and gives
[1:35:11] you a real freedom to come in line with
[1:35:13] this word like you've never been able to
[1:35:15] do it
[1:35:16] before that's real Freedom not freedom
[1:35:19] from the word but freedom to be the word
[1:35:25] am brother BM
[1:35:30] says oh
[1:35:33] my I just want to share something with
[1:35:35] you it's just an example I probably
[1:35:37] shouldn't get into this but I just feel
[1:35:39] impressed to to move forward so if I'm
[1:35:42] wrong I'll come back and say I'm
[1:35:44] sorry but you know that there's a
[1:35:46] teaching on marriage and divorce and
[1:35:48] sometimes that's quite hard to navigate
[1:35:50] through I'm not here to tell you all
[1:35:53] that's right and wrong in that in that
[1:35:55] navigation but sometimes the marriage
[1:35:57] and divorce Doctrine gets taught in a
[1:35:59] way that a man is free to remarry as
[1:36:02] long as his wife leaves him you've heard
[1:36:05] that before and I'm not going to tell
[1:36:07] you which side I am on and I'm not going
[1:36:09] to go into that I'm not that's not my
[1:36:11] point but when you drive that line and
[1:36:14] you drive it too
[1:36:15] hard now you say any man whose wife
[1:36:19] leaves him has a right to remarry
[1:36:23] you push that too hard then you're going
[1:36:25] to have a man who in unrighteousness
[1:36:27] wants his wife to leave him so that he's
[1:36:31] free to
[1:36:32] remarry so now you can take the message
[1:36:35] and push a Doctrine to the point where
[1:36:37] it actually creates unrighteousness amen
[1:36:41] right and it creates a man who will
[1:36:44] treat his wife bad be rough with his
[1:36:46] wife not serve her needs not love her
[1:36:48] not give her affection and under that
[1:36:50] kind of situation A woman won't be able
[1:36:51] to take it she'll bail and if you just
[1:36:54] have the strict order of the law that if
[1:36:56] she leaves him as long as she filed the
[1:36:59] divorce listen he divorced her long
[1:37:01] before she divorced him by not caring
[1:37:03] for her
[1:37:05] needs that's why you have to have a
[1:37:07] pastor to sort these things out you
[1:37:09] can't just make a rule and say Here's
[1:37:11] the rule because that rule will create
[1:37:13] unrighteousness like it did in the
[1:37:15] Pharisees and you'll have a man who
[1:37:17] won't act like Christ he'll act dirty
[1:37:19] and he'll act wrong and and will not
[1:37:21] treat his wife right but in the eyes of
[1:37:23] the church he's Justified to remarry and
[1:37:26] this poor woman's thrown to the curve
[1:37:27] and then thrown into adultery amen he's
[1:37:30] in adultery amen when you want to get
[1:37:33] around to the word when you really want
[1:37:34] to get to the heart of the law what did
[1:37:36] he do he put away his wife he didn't go
[1:37:39] to a lawyer he didn't sign paperwork but
[1:37:42] he put her away emotionally he put her
[1:37:44] away as a wife and he took another wife
[1:37:47] he's in adultery
[1:37:49] right that's right I mean we got to get
[1:37:52] beyond the letter of the law we got to
[1:37:53] get down to the reality friends so you
[1:37:56] see how you can take even this message
[1:37:59] and you can turn it into unrighteousness
[1:38:01] by the mind of man
[1:38:04] amen it's not going to be simple friends
[1:38:08] it's not going to be easy but it's going
[1:38:10] to take God Amen it's going to take God
[1:38:15] it's going to take a surrender it's
[1:38:17] going to take a death a death to self
[1:38:20] amen all of these
[1:38:22] manipulations they ways to preserve
[1:38:25] self so I don't have to sacrifice so I
[1:38:28] don't have to die so I can still have my
[1:38:30] way and I can still look
[1:38:32] right all that has got to
[1:38:37] die brother vam says here in the message
[1:38:40] from 1959 called images of
[1:38:45] Christ says a Shepherd has to stray to
[1:38:47] find the
[1:38:49] straying a good pastor is a Shepherd
[1:38:51] frankly the pastor the word pastor means
[1:38:54] Shepherd and sometimes in the church a
[1:38:56] little C or a little click will rise up
[1:38:58] in the church one side will get one way
[1:39:00] one side the other way a real good
[1:39:02] shepherd will go with the
[1:39:04] click what to do to bring them back
[1:39:08] listen a real true Shepherd what's he
[1:39:11] doing he will stray
[1:39:15] himself listen I I'm not telling you I
[1:39:18] understand this I'm just telling you
[1:39:19] what the prophet said he will stray
[1:39:22] himself what to do to bring back the
[1:39:24] Lost what's he doing he's reflecting the
[1:39:26] image of the Good Shepherd trying to win
[1:39:28] that soul back if they got off in some
[1:39:30] place brother like they was going to
[1:39:31] tear the world up overnight that Pastor
[1:39:33] will go right along in order to get them
[1:39:35] right win them right back this way
[1:39:38] that's a good shepherd he's reflecting
[1:39:39] the image of Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ I don't know how this works don't
[1:39:46] ask me how this
[1:39:47] works but he says he he will stray
[1:39:57] himself so how much straying will you
[1:39:59] tolerate from
[1:40:04] me you see what I mean this is this is
[1:40:09] tough how much how much flexibility will
[1:40:14] you tolerate from the pastor he's trying
[1:40:16] to win back the
[1:40:18] Sheep yes I don't ask me how this works
[1:40:22] I don't know how this works I don't know
[1:40:24] what situation brother R was addressing
[1:40:26] he didn't come out and explain it but
[1:40:28] how much flexibility or
[1:40:32] are you realize it comes down to the
[1:40:34] motive it all comes down to the motive
[1:40:37] of the heart what's the reason behind it
[1:40:39] what's the purpose that's the only thing
[1:40:40] that makes it
[1:40:42] work brother B said one time I didn't
[1:40:44] write the quote down but he said he was
[1:40:46] talking to a man and he says you don't
[1:40:49] believe that do you and the man says no
[1:40:51] I don't and brother Brandon was going to
[1:40:53] correct him so you don't believe that do
[1:40:55] he said no I don't he says but my people
[1:40:58] do and for their sakes yes and BR and
[1:41:03] brother Benham said they're legalists
[1:41:05] aren't they and he said yes they
[1:41:07] are so here's a man doing teaching
[1:41:10] living I don't know what it is in a way
[1:41:12] that he doesn't even believe is right or
[1:41:14] necessary but he's doing it for the sake
[1:41:17] of his sheep and brother Branham was
[1:41:20] actually going to challenge him on it
[1:41:23] because it's not according to the word
[1:41:25] and when brother Brenham said that he
[1:41:26] was doing it for his people's sake and
[1:41:28] brother BM said they're legalists aren't
[1:41:29] they and he said yeah brother BM said I
[1:41:31] wanted to hug his neck he said that's
[1:41:34] what Christ did for their sakes I
[1:41:36] Sanctified myself this man is going
[1:41:38] along with something that's not even
[1:41:40] doctrinally sound it's not even the word
[1:41:43] but he's doing it for their
[1:41:46] sakes was he right or
[1:41:49] wrong I'll just tell you what the
[1:41:51] prophet thought he thought he was
[1:41:55] right there was a time in my life that I
[1:41:57] would have called him a coward and a
[1:41:58] sellout and
[1:42:00] a
[1:42:08] compromiser God help
[1:42:10] me God help me to know the mind of the
[1:42:15] author that's what we need friends is
[1:42:17] the mind of the author we're not going
[1:42:19] to find it at work and we're not going
[1:42:21] to find it on the internet and we're not
[1:42:23] going to find it fooling around and
[1:42:26] playing around there's only one place to
[1:42:28] find the mind of the author and that's
[1:42:30] from the author
[1:42:32] himself amen it's the only thing that's
[1:42:34] going to
[1:42:36] work brother Bron said in this quote
[1:42:38] that's a prayer of sincerity certainly
[1:42:40] he could put them together it's not how
[1:42:42] we pray in our lips brother Bron just
[1:42:45] said he talked about the boy who didn't
[1:42:47] know how to pray he just going through
[1:42:48] his ABCs somebody said why are you
[1:42:50] rehearsing your ab BCS that's not a
[1:42:52] prayer he says well I don't know what to
[1:42:53] say I just figure if I get out all the
[1:42:55] letters God knows how to put them
[1:42:58] together brother R said yes he could
[1:43:01] certainly he could put them together
[1:43:03] it's not how we pray in our lips it's
[1:43:05] the motive of the heart is what God
[1:43:07] hears he sometimes don't hear our lips
[1:43:11] he hears Our intention what the motive
[1:43:13] of our heart amen you remember the
[1:43:17] interview of sister Bruce we've been
[1:43:18] talking about it and brother man
[1:43:19] mentioned it Wednesday T night and the
[1:43:22] tape and I'm just going to refresh your
[1:43:24] mind on a part of it sister Bruce in the
[1:43:26] private interview tells brother B I make
[1:43:28] so many stakes and I failed so many
[1:43:30] times and brother B says that's why
[1:43:33] Christ had to die so that you with your
[1:43:35] mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you he
[1:43:38] took your mistakes your desire in your
[1:43:40] heart is to serve him sister Bruce says
[1:43:43] yes all right that's what he died for so
[1:43:45] you could serve him now your mistakes
[1:43:48] are not looked nor lotted to you he is
[1:43:51] your propitiation see he is your sin
[1:43:53] offering your sins are not known you're
[1:43:55] not a sinner before God Christ took your
[1:43:58] sins and became you because your desire
[1:44:01] is to serve him so what was God looking
[1:44:04] at in Sister Bruce the desire of her
[1:44:07] heart she looked at mistakes God wasn't
[1:44:10] looking at her mistakes he said that's
[1:44:11] what the blood was for God was looking
[1:44:13] at her
[1:44:14] heart in the message discernment of
[1:44:17] spirit he says now if a man comes and
[1:44:21] he's a great gift no matter if he
[1:44:23] belongs to our denomination or another
[1:44:24] denomination don't judge him by what
[1:44:26] denom denomination he come from how he
[1:44:29] dresses but what you want to see is what
[1:44:31] is he trying to do with that gift what
[1:44:34] purpose he has if he's trying to take
[1:44:37] his influence and build himself a great
[1:44:39] name out of it I'd have disc sermin a
[1:44:41] spirit enough to know that's wrong no
[1:44:43] matter how great a teacher he is how
[1:44:45] powerful he is how intellectual he is or
[1:44:47] how his gift operates if he isn't trying
[1:44:50] to acheve achieve something for the Ben
[1:44:51] benefit of the body of Christ your own
[1:44:54] spiritual discernment would tell you
[1:44:56] that's wrong no matter how accurate how
[1:44:58] perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't
[1:45:00] used for the body of Jesus Christ to
[1:45:03] achieve something maybe he's got a great
[1:45:06] gift that he could draw people together
[1:45:08] with great intellectual or spiritual
[1:45:09] power that he could draw people together
[1:45:12] and maybe he's trying to take that gift
[1:45:13] and make himself famous so that it'll
[1:45:16] have a big name so that other Brethren
[1:45:18] will look up to him as some big person
[1:45:20] then that's wrong maybe he's trying to
[1:45:23] edify a certain thing here and that he
[1:45:25] wants everybody else to get out of the
[1:45:26] picture and let him and his group be the
[1:45:28] picture that's still wrong but if he has
[1:45:31] a gift of God and he's trying to edify
[1:45:33] the body of Christ then I don't care
[1:45:35] what he belongs to you're not Discerning
[1:45:37] the man you're Discerning the spirit the
[1:45:39] life that's in the man and that's what
[1:45:42] God told us to do not one time was we
[1:45:44] ever commissioned to discern the man's
[1:45:46] group but we was constrained and
[1:45:48] commanded by God to discern the spirit
[1:45:50] in the man man what he's trying to do
[1:45:52] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[1:45:54] lead him to and then if we can find out
[1:45:57] what he's trying to lead the people not
[1:45:59] to break up but to bring them together
[1:46:01] and to bring the Church of the Living
[1:46:02] God not all to one denomination but to
[1:46:05] understanding a fellowship of unity
[1:46:08] brother R's telling us don't look to the
[1:46:11] all these outside
[1:46:12] things he was talking about denomination
[1:46:15] in that day but you can make it anything
[1:46:17] another group another church even within
[1:46:19] the message don't look to all that
[1:46:22] what's in the heart what's the what's
[1:46:25] the intention what's this trying to do
[1:46:27] what he's trying to do with the gift
[1:46:28] these God and that's not just for
[1:46:29] preachers brother Brenham was using that
[1:46:31] for a gifted preacher but but for
[1:46:33] everyone around us where are they
[1:46:35] pointing to what direction are they
[1:46:36] going and what's the desire we may not
[1:46:38] always understand every action somebody
[1:46:41] takes amen because those things happen I
[1:46:43] wouldn't have understand the man who was
[1:46:45] going along with this legalistic church
[1:46:47] contrary to the word amen but brother
[1:46:49] brandham understood because he was doing
[1:46:50] it for their sakes from the outside
[1:46:53] brother brandham himself didn't even
[1:46:55] understand it
[1:46:57] am until he questioned the man we may
[1:47:01] not always understand every decision and
[1:47:03] everything that's made but one thing we
[1:47:05] can see is what direction are they going
[1:47:07] in what are they pointing to what is the
[1:47:09] desire of the heart because that's what
[1:47:11] God's looking
[1:47:17] at 1 Timothy 1: 15 let's turn there
[1:47:20] together together I got just a couple
[1:47:22] scriptures I want to read and then we'll
[1:47:23] be
[1:47:45] done 1 Timothy 1:
[1:47:49] 15
[1:47:53] says now the end of the Commandment is
[1:47:57] Charity that's love perfect love God's
[1:48:00] love the end of the Commandment is
[1:48:02] Charity out of a pure heart and of a
[1:48:05] good conscience and Faith
[1:48:07] unfeigned what is the end of all the
[1:48:10] Commandments all we've been taught and
[1:48:11] all that God's given us this is the
[1:48:13] conclusion the end of the Commandment is
[1:48:15] Charity love out of a pure heart and of
[1:48:19] a good conscience and a faith unfeigned
[1:48:23] that means without hypocrisy without
[1:48:25] pretending that's what all of this is
[1:48:27] coming to so that we can be this so that
[1:48:31] this scripture can take on flesh this
[1:48:33] isn't a impossibility friends this is
[1:48:36] the result of the word being restored
[1:48:40] this is a result of a surrendered life
[1:48:41] to Christ and Christ coming in and
[1:48:43] living his life this is what God wants
[1:48:45] in his church and this is what I want in
[1:48:48] my life this is what we're striving
[1:48:53] for let's go to Psalms 139 this is a
[1:48:59] prayer a prayer that I want to read a
[1:49:03] prayer of
[1:49:05] David we know that David was a man after
[1:49:07] God's Own heart and even that man after
[1:49:10] God's Own
[1:49:11] Heart you know he did some things that
[1:49:14] he shouldn't have done and he repented
[1:49:15] and he was called out and he repented
[1:49:17] but but his heart towards God never ch
[1:49:20] changed he did things contrary to the
[1:49:23] law he ate the
[1:49:25] showbread he he he caused Jonathan to
[1:49:29] deceive his father and tell him that he
[1:49:30] went home for a feast day but actually
[1:49:33] he remained so Jonathan could find out
[1:49:35] if his father was angry or not and then
[1:49:36] could meet him in the field to tell him
[1:49:38] whether he should go home or not that
[1:49:40] was a whole
[1:49:41] deception but he was a man after God's
[1:49:44] Own
[1:49:46] Heart he sent back his counselor to
[1:49:48] deceive Absalom
[1:49:51] to be a spy to be a mole in his
[1:49:55] cabinet ate the Sho bread that wasn't
[1:49:58] lawful put on a priest garment and
[1:50:01] worshiped in the Tabernacle of David and
[1:50:03] took the incense like a priest before
[1:50:05] the
[1:50:06] ark but yet he was a man after God's Own
[1:50:10] Heart here's what he prayed in Psalms
[1:50:14] 139 let's go down to verse
[1:50:19] 23 Psalms 139:23 search me oh God and
[1:50:23] know my heart try me and know my
[1:50:27] thoughts and see if there be any wicked
[1:50:29] way in me and Lead Me in the way
[1:50:33] Everlasting I think that's a good prayer
[1:50:35] for all of us search me oh God I don't
[1:50:38] even know some of the crevices that that
[1:50:40] sin is hiding in me I don't even know
[1:50:42] some of the things that that that I
[1:50:44] don't know but search me oh God and know
[1:50:46] my heart try me and know my thoughts and
[1:50:48] see if there be any wicked way in me and
[1:50:50] Lead Me in the way Everlasting that's my
[1:50:55] prayer brother B made this statement and
[1:50:58] the godhead explained and he's referring
[1:51:01] back to the argument because between the
[1:51:02] Oneness Minister and the assembly's
[1:51:04] minister the trinitarian he's referring
[1:51:07] back to that he said now I said to
[1:51:09] brother Schism and brother NES to answer
[1:51:11] your question said now I do not take
[1:51:14] either sides with you Brethren and I
[1:51:16] know as long as you fuss you're both
[1:51:18] wrong see because I would rather be
[1:51:21] wrong in my Doctrine and right in my
[1:51:23] heart than to be right in my Doctrine
[1:51:25] and wrong in my heart said after all
[1:51:29] it's your heart's
[1:51:31] condition what is it that matters the
[1:51:33] most it's your heart's
[1:51:37] condition let's go to Jeremiah 31 and
[1:51:40] I'm going to end with this with this
[1:51:42] scripture I'm going to close here
[1:51:44] musicians if you want to make your way
[1:51:46] up while we turn to
[1:51:48] Jeremiah
[1:52:02] Jeremiah 31 let's go to uh verse
[1:52:06] 33 Jeremiah 31
[1:52:12] and33 he said but this shall be my
[1:52:14] Covenant that I will make with the house
[1:52:16] of Israel after those days sayith the
[1:52:18] Lord I will put my law and their inward
[1:52:21] parts and I will write it in their
[1:52:24] hearts and I will be their God and they
[1:52:27] shall be my
[1:52:28] people I believe that's what we need
[1:52:32] today I need
[1:52:35] God I need God to put his law in my
[1:52:38] inward parts and to write it in my
[1:52:43] heart I need to go beyond intellect
[1:52:47] Beyond human effort Beyond human
[1:52:49] understanding
[1:52:50] but I need him to put his word in my
[1:52:52] heart and my inward part and I need him
[1:52:55] to write it in my heart because he's
[1:52:58] judging my inward parts and he's judging
[1:53:00] my heart say search me oh God snow my
[1:53:05] thoughts find if there be any wicked way
[1:53:08] in me and Lead Me in the way that's
[1:53:10] Everlasting and have this promise come
[1:53:13] true for me put your word in my heart
[1:53:16] your law in my heart and write your word
[1:53:18] in my inner part
[1:53:20] am that's the only way I'm going to make
[1:53:22] it friends I
[1:53:24] believe that's why the message came so
[1:53:28] that we could have the word of God in
[1:53:31] our inward Parts the whole word has come
[1:53:34] the whole mind of Christ the whole the
[1:53:37] the whole mind of the author has come so
[1:53:40] that we we may fumble around in quoting
[1:53:43] scriptures but we need to know the
[1:53:44] author real
[1:53:46] well to navigate situations that are are
[1:53:50] complex and may become more complex as
[1:53:52] time moves on we're going to need that
[1:53:55] law written in our hearts and we're
[1:53:57] going to need his his precepts in our
[1:53:59] inward parts and we're going to need him
[1:54:00] to lead us in the way of everlasting
[1:54:03] life I need him more than ever
[1:54:09] before you can do everything right still
[1:54:12] be
[1:54:13] wrong you can do wrong and still be
[1:54:18] right I don't
[1:54:20] I don't get it and I don't promote
[1:54:23] it I hope you understand my
[1:54:26] heart I'm not advising that we try some
[1:54:28] wrong things to see if they work out
[1:54:30] right stick with the word stay with the
[1:54:34] word the word is our life the word has
[1:54:37] been given to us keep it obey it obey
[1:54:42] the messenger amen just obey it it's for
[1:54:46] you amen it's not for him it's for you
[1:54:50] right surrender to the word amen but not
[1:54:54] through
[1:54:55] religion but through a consecrated life
[1:54:58] surrendered to Christ through a personal
[1:55:00] revelation of Jesus Christ revealed
[1:55:02] personally to me and to his life in me
[1:55:05] and my life in him let that be
[1:55:08] everything let's have real genuine fear
[1:55:10] of the Lord not what's taught by the
[1:55:13] precept of man but what comes from a
[1:55:15] relationship with God knowing that
[1:55:17] tomorrow morning when I get on my knees
[1:55:18] I'll face God
[1:55:20] and the things that I said and the
[1:55:22] things that I thought and the things
[1:55:23] that I looked at will Flash before my
[1:55:25] face when I kneel on my face before God
[1:55:28] that's where we get genuine fear of
[1:55:31] God that's where there's no more
[1:55:33] pretending when we kneel down in his
[1:55:36] presence and he unravels us and it's all
[1:55:39] there and all you can say is God I'm
[1:55:41] sorry sorry for what I saw saw I sorry
[1:55:44] for what I thought I sorry for what I
[1:55:45] did and that genuine fear of God keeps
[1:55:48] us from taking what would be a gray area
[1:55:51] or a loophole it keeps us from taking
[1:55:54] that and just going to serve self and to
[1:55:56] serve our pride and to make it easier
[1:55:58] for ourselves what will keep us from
[1:55:59] doing that the only thing that will keep
[1:56:02] us from doing that is fear of the
[1:56:04] Lord because some things are so tricky
[1:56:07] to navigate you can go by selfish
[1:56:09] desires and take the word and you can
[1:56:11] take the word and you make it a religion
[1:56:13] and you can hide your sin behind
[1:56:17] quotes you can hide your your sin your
[1:56:20] selfishness your pride you can hide your
[1:56:23] own willfulness you can hide it behind
[1:56:26] quotes you can hide it behind
[1:56:29] scriptures because if they're taken with
[1:56:31] the wrong motive they can be manipulated
[1:56:33] for the wrong
[1:56:34] purposes religion over the last
[1:56:37] thousands of years has showed us
[1:56:40] that what's the only thing that can keep
[1:56:43] us straight listen it's not going to be
[1:56:45] it's not going to be a stricter church
[1:56:48] and it's not going to be a pastor with
[1:56:49] with more
[1:56:50] discernment the only thing that's going
[1:56:52] to keep us straight is our fear of the
[1:56:54] Lord that's the only thing that's going
[1:56:56] to bring us through is our fear of the
[1:56:59] Lord and our honor respect for him amen
[1:57:03] let's all
[1:57:05] stand and let's just ask the Lord to
[1:57:09] search our
[1:57:12] hearts amen let's bow our
[1:57:15] heads dear heavenly father I thank you
[1:57:18] Lord
[1:57:19] you are so amazing
[1:57:22] Lord God your word is intentionally too
[1:57:26] complex for
[1:57:28] us it's too complex for the human
[1:57:31] mind it takes too many turns it's it's
[1:57:35] too
[1:57:36] unexplainable there's so many situations
[1:57:39] that we can't sort out we can't
[1:57:41] understand we don't know what to do how
[1:57:44] to
[1:57:46] handle God we we run up against things
[1:57:49] in your word and and things in the
[1:57:51] message you've given us statements we
[1:57:53] can't reconcile things that look like
[1:57:55] they go two different
[1:57:57] directions what be right in one
[1:57:59] situation maybe wrong in another wrong
[1:58:01] in one situation right in another lord
[1:58:03] it's beyond our
[1:58:06] ability and father I believe you want it
[1:58:08] to be that way I believe it's by
[1:58:12] Design so that we can't have a
[1:58:15] textbook that we can't have a code we
[1:58:19] can't have a search
[1:58:21] program that'll spit out easy
[1:58:24] answers God we have to search our own
[1:58:26] heart we have to lay bare before you and
[1:58:28] ask you to search our heart we have to
[1:58:31] fear you and love you and put you first
[1:58:33] above everything else you're looking for
[1:58:35] preeminence in every area of our
[1:58:38] life God we want you to have preeminence
[1:58:41] Lord we want you to search our hearts
[1:58:42] and make our hearts right I'm asking God
[1:58:45] that you search me and you search out my
[1:58:47] heart and search my thoughts
[1:58:50] that you know me Lord and that you lead
[1:58:52] me in the way that's right and I pray
[1:58:55] God that you'd write your law in My
[1:58:56] Heart Lord not in my head but in my
[1:58:59] heart that you put your precepts in my
[1:59:01] inward parts that you would share your
[1:59:03] mind with me by your Holy Ghost Lord
[1:59:05] that I would know in the situations I
[1:59:08] find myself in what is the right thing
[1:59:10] to do in every circumstance and in every
[1:59:13] situation God may I be led by your
[1:59:16] spirit even when I don't know may your
[1:59:17] spirit Lead Me Lord in the way of
[1:59:19] everlasting life that I might be found
[1:59:22] pleasing you and at the end of the day
[1:59:24] Lord may may my heart be pure before
[1:59:27] you Lord help us to come to the end of
[1:59:30] the
[1:59:31] Commandment to serve
[1:59:33] you Lord with love from a perfect heart
[1:59:38] and a good
[1:59:40] conscience and perfect
[1:59:42] Faith Lord I pray you bless your people
[1:59:45] help us to go from here and God help us
[1:59:48] to be real
[1:59:50] Christians genuine from the core of us
[1:59:53] all the way through sincere and loving
[1:59:56] and putting you first and everything
[1:59:58] help us to be
[1:59:59] real God I pray that you'd Shine the
[2:00:02] Light of your gospel in our heart Lord
[2:00:04] that we might see those areas we need to
[2:00:06] repent of and stay away from help us to
[2:00:08] be genuine and real almighty God I love
[2:00:12] you Lord I ask that you would bless us
[2:00:13] as we part and guide us through life we
[2:00:16] pray in Jesus Christ's name
