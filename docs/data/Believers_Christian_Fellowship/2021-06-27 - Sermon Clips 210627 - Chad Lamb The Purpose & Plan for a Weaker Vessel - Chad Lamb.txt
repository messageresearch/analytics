TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the key to redemption the key to the expression of god laid in the woman the woman was the key that unlocked the mystery of redemption she was the key that unlocked the attributes of god being on display because without the fall you don't know a savior you don't know a healer you don't know a deliverer there's so much of god that cannot be expressed so the key to the full expression of god was the woman she was fashioned because the because the the the the redemption the sealing and unsealing of the book the lamb slain before the foundation of the world god as a savior god is a healer god is a deliverer it was all locked up and bound up is that true it was all locked up and bound up in order for that to be expressed there had to be a fall but god cannot make anything fallen he can't make it corrupted he can't make it fallen he can only make it with the ability to be corrupted but he can't make it corrupted so he made a byproduct not because he hated woman but she was going to become the tool in his hand and that weaker vessel would become the tool in god's hand that would unlock the mystery of redemption that's why god is going to take the very same tool to finish the mystery of redemption amen he had to have the weaker vessel the weaker vessel is attached to redemption amen so the serpent came to her the devil through the serpent and and to deceive amen so that she could unlock amen all the attributes that were in god and now god could step on the scene he could be a heavenly father he could be a redeemer he could be a healer he could be a deliverer he could be a comforter he could be all that he ever intended to be because of the weaker vessel but because god fashioned her so and god foreordained for new and for knowledge knew it would be this way he also chose the very same vessel to continue the work of redemption all the way down to the finished mark it's the weaker vessel that he's going to use the weaker vessel is attached to redemption hallelujah now husbands dwell with wives according to knowledge giving honor unto the weaker vessel because this is the vessel god is using for redemption
