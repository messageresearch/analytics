TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the fful ministry is here to stabilize the church so every new thought that comes in doesn't send us running every new teaching every new idea amen we the ministry is here to bring a stabilization amen the ministry shouldn't be the ones bringing instability they should bringing us a stability Amen to where now every thing that sweeps through it doesn't it doesn't scatter it doesn't cause us to run it doesn't cause us to get tossed to and fro amen we're already stabilized we already know who we are in Christ we already know that we have been chosen by God and God is revealing himself to us and every new thing that comes down it may be a direct Revelation from God it may be another wind of Doctrine that's moving through amen but I don't have to be shaken if it's God who reveal it to me because I'm stable in who I am I am his bride he will reveal the truth to me I don't need tossed around like a child because of every new teaching that comes I can hold steady amen what's going to Help Me Hold Steady this is the purpose of the five-fold ministry so you have a true identification of who you are coming into a maturity so you don't get knocked around every time something new sweeps through because something new may be absolutely genuine from God another level he wants to take us through it could be another mixed idea of man amen and we don't know we could get tossed and Scattered and run about and arguing and fighting with who's right and who's wrong what we need to do is be stable and not be like children and Hold Steady if it's of God it'll ring true it'll ring true it'll ring true it'll stay it'll grow and it won't change amen but I don't need to worry about it if half my brother see it and I don't see it that shouldn't change my identification with who I am I need to wait till God shows me amen way I don't need to pretend I see something I don't see that means I don't need to go with the crowd because this is the more spiritual crowd I don't need to give up my my my own discernment amen because this is a more senior brother amen no I'm not getting tossed by every wind of Doctrine a true fold ministry will establish the bride so they're not getting tossed about they're not immature they've come into a place where they know who they are and when something new comes they can say praise the Lord if this is from God it'll ring true let's just wait I don't see it yet but let's just watch tell you something else that it'll do amen they'll just watch until they see the nature of that thing sounds good it sounds good but what life is it producing what's the nature of that thing I'm not getting tossed about by everything that sounds good but behind it comes an arrogant spirit and behind it becomes a nasty attitude and behind it becomes division no I think I'll just wait because I'm not going to lose my sunship I'm not going to lose my position with Christ I'm not rejecting the word I'm just not jumping in amen the ministry should be making the Believers stable mature
