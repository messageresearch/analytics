[0:00] if your mother or my mother would have
[0:02] walked out on the street the way one of
[0:03] these women
[0:04] they would have put her in an insane
[0:05] institution she didn't even have enough
[0:07] mind to know to put her clothes put on
[0:09] her clothes
[0:10] well if it was insanity then it's
[0:12] insanity now
[0:14] this is a major statement that brother
[0:15] branham is making and i want to catch
[0:17] that
[0:17] brother brethren saying if it was
[0:19] insanity there what's
[0:21] changed if it was insanity to do that
[0:24] then why is it not insanity now
[0:26] what is change amen and we redefining
[0:30] what's saying and not saying
[0:31] we know that's true but if he's ever was
[0:33] in sanity it will always be insanity
[0:37] but cultures change to where it's become
[0:39] accepted and now nobody considers it
[0:42] wrong or insane
[0:43] but but there was a time a period of
[0:45] time when man was not so polluted and
[0:48] not so corrupted because corruption
[0:49] comes over time
[0:51] and there was a time that they would you
[0:54] know the majority of people would have
[0:55] looked at that and said
[0:56] that's insane that's wrong but now as
[0:59] corruption
[1:00] set in and corruption breeds more
[1:02] corruption and things deteriorate to the
[1:04] point
[1:04] where now the society says no this is
[1:07] normal
[1:07] and they go beyond saying it's normal or
[1:09] acceptable now it becomes preferred
[1:13] and after it becomes preferred then it
[1:16] becomes protected
[1:18] and once it's protected now anything
[1:21] against it is evil and insane
[1:26] what was once insane
[1:29] is now become normal accepted
[1:33] preferred protected and to say anything
[1:36] against it or take a different position
[1:38] now is insane
[1:39] the thing is completely flipped
[1:43] but the question is has god changed one
[1:46] drop
[1:46] amen has anything changed in his nature
[1:49] has anything
[1:50] changed in his thinking has anything
[1:51] changed in the desire
[1:53] nothing has changed in god what it is is
[1:55] satan's eden has come to perfection
[1:58] and his perfection is a total perversion
[2:00] of god's word
[2:01] his will and his plan
[2:05] but when you know his word his will and
[2:06] your plan amen when you look at this
[2:08] thing that's confusing to the world
[2:10] and confusing to denominational churches
[2:13] i mean they don't understand
[2:14] they know morality has changed they know
[2:17] dress and conduct and behavior
[2:19] has changed but they don't know what to
[2:21] do about it they don't know how to keep
[2:22] up with the change
[2:23] they no longer know where to draw the
[2:25] line to say what is right and what is
[2:27] wrong
[2:27] because they don't know the word the
[2:30] will and the plan of god
[2:32] and because they don't know the word the
[2:34] will and the plan of god amen they're
[2:36] trying to adapt to the new normal
[2:38] and they're trying to find out what's
[2:40] right in the new normal
[2:42] because they don't have the word the
[2:44] will and the plan of god
[2:45] but by revelation of this hour we know
[2:48] the word the will and the plan of god
[2:49] and you can step back and say
[2:51] nothing's changed with god
[2:54] what was once wrong is still wrong what
[2:57] was once insane
[2:58] is still insane
