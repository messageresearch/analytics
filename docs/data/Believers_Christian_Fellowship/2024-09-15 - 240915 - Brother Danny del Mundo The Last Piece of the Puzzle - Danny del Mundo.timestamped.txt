[15:14] delmundo he's no stranger he's been here
[15:16] several times and him and I have been
[15:19] friends for I think almost 15 years now
[15:22] and and uh I've really grown to
[15:24] appreciate my brother I've watched him
[15:26] in many places ministering and I've seen
[15:29] what God has used him for and what uh
[15:31] what he's been willing to surrender
[15:33] himself to be used for and I thank God
[15:35] for that you know brother Danny's been a
[15:37] pastor now for almost 30 years and he's
[15:40] traveled all over and God has used him
[15:42] he's been a tool in the hand of God to
[15:44] bring the message to many places he was
[15:47] instrumental God used him in bringing
[15:48] the message to Indonesia and getting the
[15:50] work established there also into Japan
[15:53] in Myanmar and now he has a new open
[15:56] door just beginning in uh South Korea
[15:59] and I've seen him willing to leave and
[16:01] willing to go and willing to surrender
[16:03] and start from scratch with almost
[16:05] nothing and seen God bless it and bring
[16:08] fruit from the ministry and so it's been
[16:10] a real encouragement to me to watch my
[16:12] friend and learn from him and it's been
[16:14] a real blessing to just be associated
[16:17] with brother Dany and his family we know
[16:19] them all quite well and his home church
[16:21] we know them well and it's just quite a
[16:23] testimony there's quite a light that's
[16:24] shining there and I thank God for it
[16:27] it's always so nice that you know know
[16:29] we've had the opportunity to help him in
[16:31] some small way to go a little further
[16:32] Maybe cover a few expenses and it's so
[16:35] nice that he'll come by and stop in and
[16:37] check in with us and we can get to hear
[16:39] from him because we want to continue to
[16:41] help him and bless him and maybe ease
[16:43] some of his load if we can as God uses
[16:46] him to minister this precious message in
[16:49] Asia amen so I'm excited to have him
[16:52] with us again for visit excited to hear
[16:55] the word this morning and to get my
[16:57] portion

[17:01] but I want him to be able to relax I
[17:03] want to be able to just relax and drop
[17:05] back into that channel of inspiration
[17:08] where he can relax and switch gears and
[17:10] God can take over and I know to help him
[17:12] do that is if we can pull on the word
[17:14] it'll help him switch into that gear so
[17:16] I want to do my part and make it easy

[20:28] Hallelujah so without further Ado we
[20:31] would like to go on the reading of the
[20:35] scripture
[20:37] uh in Zechariah we're going to use this
[20:40] as our uh text and of course we're going
[20:43] to use few more scriptures to drive our
[20:46] Point by God's
[20:50] help Amen in in the book of Zechariah
[20:53] chap 4 we will read verses 9 and 10 I
[20:57] know this is very much familiar to
[20:59] everyone he said in verse 9 the hands of
[21:04] zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[21:06] this house his hands shall also finish
[21:11] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[21:14] hosts hath sent me unto
[21:18] you for who hath despised the day of
[21:21] small things for they shall rejoice and
[21:23] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[21:25] zerubabel with those seven they are the
[21:29] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[21:32] through the whole earth may the Lord add
[21:34] his Blessing to the reading of his word
[21:37] let's bow our heads in prayer dear
[21:39] heavenly father we thank you for this
[21:41] opportunity once again to minister your
[21:43] word and Lord there's nothing I can say
[21:48] there's nothing I can do except Lord you
[21:51] open this mouth and speak your words
[21:56] through this lips of clay Lord Lord and
[22:00] uh your people have come here under
[22:02] certain expectation oh God not from a
[22:05] man but from you that we will feed on so
[22:10] God once again we thank you we commit
[22:12] this service into your Mighty hands in
[22:14] Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen God
[22:17] bless you you may now be seated
[22:21] amen so
[22:23] the
[22:25] uh the scriptures that we have just read
[22:28] I know this is uh very familiar but we
[22:32] just have to talk few portions of that
[22:35] of it and uh may the Lord uh uh give us
[22:41] something that we will be able to bring
[22:43] home
[22:44] today amen hallelujah so we see that the
[22:49] background of this uh
[22:53] scriptures is the restoration of uh of
[22:58] God's
[22:59] Temple and it says that the foundation
[23:03] of this
[23:04] house his hands not the hands of men but
[23:10] it's the hand of God Amen because God
[23:14] use men uh Inspire them to do something
[23:18] to accomplish for his own glory amen so
[23:23] uh the prophet of God said his hands
[23:25] shall also finish it so he is the author
[23:29] and the finisher of our faith amen he he
[23:33] anything that he has started is going to
[23:36] perform to complete everything that he
[23:39] has started because he's the author he's
[23:42] the finisher he's the alpha amen and
[23:45] he's the Omega he's the beginning and
[23:47] the end so uh so God called us to bring
[23:52] us to a certain place a certain
[23:56] condition a certain atmosphere
[23:58] where he will bring Perfection unto us
[24:01] amen so he said now and and uh he said
[24:04] his hand shall also finish it and thou
[24:06] shalt know that the Lord of hosts has
[24:09] sent me unto you for who ha despised the
[24:12] day of small things amen so if we are
[24:16] you know uh I have met lots of Brethren
[24:19] uh in this in this assembly that are
[24:22] doing construction uh by the Elmer and
[24:25] the rest of the Brethren you know so you
[24:27] see
[24:29] uh when we come to the end when we come
[24:33] to the last part of what we are doing
[24:36] whether it's a construction whether it's
[24:38] a simple project when we come to the End
[24:41] Amen uh the last part the last stage of
[24:45] what we are doing amen we we give
[24:51] details amen we are H applying the last
[24:56] the final touches
[24:58] amen and and and and when we come to the
[25:00] finishing touches there are little
[25:05] things that though little they are
[25:09] important and they give detail to the
[25:12] project and everything every every last
[25:15] T every Last Detail that you put in amen
[25:19] uh gives a clear picture of what was in
[25:24] the mind of somebody amen who designed
[25:27] it from the beginning from the very
[25:29] start from from uh orchestrating from
[25:32] the beginning to uh uh to its end so
[25:36] every little detail amen adds
[25:40] Beauty and I believe it's the same thing
[25:43] with the message of the hour we are in
[25:46] the last stage we are in the final part
[25:49] of our journey that everything that we
[25:52] do no matter how little it is amen it
[25:56] adds Beauty it is important brother bam
[25:59] said you know it's not the big things
[26:02] it's not the great things amen that we
[26:05] do but it's the little things that we
[26:08] live
[26:09] undone amen uh so it is very important
[26:13] so H H I would like to tell you also
[26:17] this morning that you are as important
[26:20] no matter how little you are amen your
[26:23] space in the church your portion amen
[26:27] the uhh the seat that occupy amen it is
[26:30] so important because it adds detail to
[26:34] the last stage of our journey amen so
[26:37] now just like you know when when when we
[26:40] remember
[26:41] Noah you know we knowing Noah's like we
[26:44] have said before Noah preached for 120
[26:47] years amen but I never I don't and will
[26:50] never believe that Noah preached the
[26:53] same thing all throughout these 120
[26:56] years amen he he he didn't go in the
[26:58] morning and say okay my my my precious
[27:02] family amen uh God said it will rain 40
[27:06] days and 40 nights amen and then the
[27:09] whole day is going to repeat all these
[27:11] things and then the following day amen
[27:14] it's 120 years amen and 360 days in a
[27:20] year amen so I believe amen that the uh
[27:26] it took 120 years
[27:28] because there's so much
[27:31] detail in the ark of
[27:34] Noah amen every detail amen the piece of
[27:37] wood the uh uh the the kind of Timber
[27:41] everything so every day amen every day
[27:44] when they wake up amen there's always
[27:47] something new amen that that not just
[27:49] something new that they listen to but
[27:52] something new that they have to do on
[27:55] that particular day so they have
[27:57] accomplished so much in 120 years of
[28:02] Noah's Ministry amen
[28:05] because of the
[28:07] details Hallelujah so until they come
[28:11] amen that that that the Last Detail the
[28:13] last word that was being preached by
[28:15] Noah at that time and that Last Detail
[28:19] Hallelujah and that that shut the door
[28:22] amen and started in all the doubts all
[28:25] these uh uh uh Skeptics amen that that
[28:29] you know uh put so much uh uh words amen
[28:32] bringing sarcasm and insult to the
[28:35] family to no and his family amen we're
[28:38] done amen when that last and final
[28:42] detail amen has been laid down
[28:45] Hallelujah so that's why we would like
[28:49] to uh uh give a title on this sermon
[28:53] amen it's just a piece amen so just
[28:56] little it's the last pie piece of the
[28:59] puzzle amen so it's the last piece of
[29:01] the
[29:02] puzzle so we're familiar with that
[29:05] brother bam made mention about uh about
[29:09] the pule that when we place uh something
[29:13] we might uh he said you know we might
[29:15] have a complete uh uh
[29:19] materials of everything uh we might have
[29:23] a cow a tree and a green pasture amen
[29:26] but if you misplay
[29:30] something and you put the cow on top of
[29:33] the tree amen it's
[29:35] horrible amen it's not the right you
[29:39] it's not the right picture amen so it's
[29:42] the same thing with this message of the
[29:43] hour when we misplace something the
[29:47] scripture is complete amen the Bible is
[29:50] complete but it must be every every
[29:54] piece every portion every verse of the
[29:57] scripture must be placed in his rightful
[29:59] position so that we will be able Amen to
[30:03] see the complete picture of what God's
[30:06] perfect plan is amen and this is the
[30:09] problem you know that's why people can
[30:11] can look at the scripture reading the
[30:12] same Bible and they can present three
[30:15] Gods amen they can present you know
[30:18] three persons and then they believe that
[30:20] there is one God it's because amen the
[30:23] pieces are not properly properly placed
[30:27] amen and brother B said it takes the
[30:29] Holy Spirit it takes the Holy Ghost amen
[30:32] so that we will be able to place and
[30:35] position every piece of it thank God
[30:39] Hallelujah so
[30:41] now uh to be able to to communicate my
[30:46] my thought this morning I would like to
[30:49] uh uh us to uh talk about a a a parable
[30:54] that the prophet also used Amen in Luke
[30:57] chap
[30:59] 15 uh there is a parable here and this
[31:02] is the parable of the lost coin amen so
[31:07] it says here in verse 8 either what
[31:10] woman having 10 pieces of
[31:13] silver if she lose one
[31:15] piece do not light a candle and sweep
[31:19] the house and seek diligently till she
[31:22] find it and when she had found it she
[31:26] call it her friends and her neighbors
[31:29] together saying Rejoice with me for I
[31:33] have found the peace which I had lost
[31:37] amen so uh brother bam said you know uh
[31:42] this is the message of
[31:43] restoration and uh when we speak about
[31:48] restoration uh it is bringing things in
[31:52] its
[31:53] original condition in its uh every piece
[31:57] in its
[31:58] original Place amen and it's also
[32:03] placing or restoring back in its
[32:05] original
[32:08] condition but uh there's another
[32:11] scripture here that the prophet of God
[32:13] used in relation to this
[32:16] Parable and it says in it we can look at
[32:19] that in Galatians 5 verse
[32:22] 22 it said but the fruit of the spirit
[32:25] is love joy peace long suffering gentle
[32:28] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[32:30] against such there is no
[32:33] law okay and of course we see there nine
[32:37] gifts amen and brother BR I'm referring
[32:41] in Galatians 5 in the message the second
[32:44] coming of the Lord he said if you want
[32:46] to look it up look in Galatians 5 you'll
[32:49] find out that that woman represented the
[32:54] church amen and the church in a and is
[32:57] an spouse wife to Christ and the tablet
[33:01] that the church is supposed to wear is
[33:04] found in Galatians 5 he repeat it again
[33:07] which is love joy peace longsuffering
[33:10] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[33:12] that is the tablet that's supposed to be
[33:14] worn in the church amen so I wonder amen
[33:20] if if if you know brother brandham is I
[33:22] believe is telling us something here so
[33:25] it's not something this is not accident
[33:28] amen that there's only nine gifts and
[33:31] the prophet of God because the prophet
[33:33] is a Seer amen the prophet can see
[33:36] things that are on on on ordinary eyes
[33:39] amen can see amen and so referring to
[33:42] Galatians 5 and then he referred that to
[33:46] the same Parable amen that the church is
[33:50] uh uh being spoused to wife he said that
[33:53] this Parable has something to do with
[33:55] the second coming of the Lord
[33:58] amen
[34:02] so that means there is
[34:05] something lacking in Galatians
[34:10] 5 and no one Among Us have seen that
[34:15] before but thank God we have a prophet
[34:18] in this
[34:19] generation Hallelujah so that's why many
[34:21] churches many Circles of religious
[34:24] groups you know can always repair the
[34:26] scriptures in amen and and and and
[34:29] repair to the nine gifts of the Spirit
[34:32] amen but not
[34:34] realizing that something you know
[34:36] something is
[34:39] missing and here is where it comes to
[34:43] Amen to place everything to make it
[34:45] complete amen the last piece must be
[34:50] placed so we can see the whole picture
[34:53] and I believe the prophet of God has a
[34:56] reason in in this Parable and the Lord
[35:00] help us amen so now going back to the
[35:04] scripture that we have just read Nas
[35:06] made mention now he said now in the last
[35:09] in the in in uh in this day in the in
[35:13] the book of church ages he said it is
[35:16] very evident that the word they refers
[35:19] to men thus we see that the eyes of the
[35:23] Lord in this instance are men of course
[35:26] they will be anointed men Men full of
[35:28] the Holy Ghost for God's Ministries are
[35:31] not in the power of men but of the Holy
[35:34] Ghost putting our scriptural discoveries
[35:38] together it is evident that the seven
[35:40] spirits of God refer to the continuous
[35:44] Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the
[35:47] lives of seven men with whom God
[35:50] identifies himself very closely they are
[35:53] his eyes and they are his lamps amen so
[35:57] it's very clear here amen that the seven
[35:59] spirits of god mentioned in the book of
[36:01] Zariah also being made mention in the
[36:04] Book of Revelation amen H uh uh do not
[36:08] in any way represent seven gods or seven
[36:12] you know but they are the same Spirit of
[36:15] the same God and mean he said it is a
[36:19] continual representation of himself
[36:22] through these seven men amen so he said
[36:24] the seven spirits of God refer to the
[36:26] continuous Ministry of the same Holy
[36:29] Spirit in the lives of seven men with
[36:32] whom God identifies himself very closely
[36:35] they are his eyes and they are his
[36:39] lamps another statement for this purpose
[36:42] amen days of the finishing touches now
[36:44] watch there is a lot of truth lost out
[36:47] there amen and he said why were others
[36:51] compromise on truth but these seventh
[36:54] angel don't compromise on nothing can
[36:57] you say Amen to that amen he had not in
[37:00] any way compromised the truth and then
[37:03] he said he gathers up all the Loose Ends
[37:07] gathers them all up and at his sounding
[37:11] all the mysteries of God should be
[37:13] finish oh God send him all of the Hidden
[37:16] Mysteries were finished when he it was
[37:20] revealed to him by what if these are
[37:23] hidden mysteries the man will have to be
[37:26] a prophet amen amen amen he's not just a
[37:29] reformer he not just you know but he
[37:32] must be a prophet and then uh we just
[37:35] get through and see that the prophet
[37:37] that would come in the last age we would
[37:40] would would be that great Elijah that
[37:43] we've been looking for of course we know
[37:46] we know uh uh who that is now another
[37:49] statement for the days of the finishing
[37:51] touches he said now these stars are
[37:53] falling into their constellation back
[37:55] Yonder that angel coming and said as
[37:58] John was sent to wind up all the Old
[38:01] Testament and to bring forth the
[38:04] introduction of Christ a message am that
[38:09] we have been hearing amen a message will
[38:13] wind up the Loose Ends and will
[38:16] introduce the
[38:18] Messiah just before his coming and this
[38:21] is the message of the last days amen
[38:24] amen so this message amen being being
[38:27] spoken by the messenger of this
[38:30] generation its very purpose is to
[38:33] introduce the Messiah amen amen
[38:37] hallelujah so we're not we're not just
[38:41] here to to see the sign no but we need
[38:44] to go where the sign is pointing us amen
[38:48] so and let me put a scripture on that in
[38:51] in Amos 5:8 it said seek him that maketh
[38:56] the Seven Stars
[38:58] and Orion Hallelujah and Orion is the
[39:01] the the constellation and out of the
[39:02] many stars amen and in other scriptures
[39:05] amen God knows how many stars there are
[39:09] Amen in the constellation out there in
[39:11] heaven amen and God gave them
[39:18] names so if God was able to give them
[39:21] names and we have you know millions of
[39:24] stars out there and God knew each of of
[39:27] them and don't forget amen that one of
[39:31] those stars represent you one of those
[39:34] stars represent me amen so when when
[39:37] when God said Abraham look at those you
[39:40] know look at those can you number the
[39:41] dust of the earth amen Abraham could not
[39:45] but God knew how many Hallelujah if he
[39:48] know how many hairs we have in our head
[39:50] God knows how many dust there are in the
[39:53] coast amen and he said now amen look at
[39:55] the dust and then and then then God said
[39:58] now God Abraham from the dash you look
[40:02] up amen if you cannot number those uh uh
[40:06] D can you number those stars in heaven
[40:09] amen but and and God said Hallelujah
[40:12] those stars are the numbers of your
[40:16] seeds amen so from dust to Stars so
[40:20] that's the same thing with us amen from
[40:22] th we come amen from the natural birth
[40:25] we come but God amen from the dust amen
[40:28] he lifted us up so that we can see our
[40:31] representation up there in heaven and we
[40:33] know who we are amen and that's why we
[40:36] know how to conduct ourselves in this
[40:38] generation glory to God so understand so
[40:41] that is the reason why amen we we uh uh
[40:44] uh uh we recognize and you know we those
[40:47] three Magi were not able to see amen the
[40:51] Messiah that was born in their
[40:53] generation if they did not follow the
[40:56] star yes
[40:58] so how can you find the pure word in
[41:00] this generation that will send that will
[41:03] bring us prepare us to the Rapture if
[41:05] you don't recognize the
[41:08] sign the prophet but as I say we just
[41:12] don't stop there amen but as this the
[41:16] the parable said seek
[41:19] diligently amen and so in Amos 58 he
[41:22] said seek Him amen that maketh the Stars
[41:28] seek him that identifies the Stars
[41:33] Hallelujah you know in the Book of
[41:35] Revelation you know in his right hand
[41:37] there's seven stars and in this right
[41:40] hand the prophet of God said there very
[41:42] reason why they are in the hand of him
[41:45] because they were personally picked by
[41:48] the Lord himself and because they are in
[41:52] his right hand God is obligated to take
[41:55] care of them to equip them Hallelujah
[41:58] and thank God Amen we are identified at
[42:01] least one of those Stars so no one can
[42:05] PL us out of the the the the hand of God
[42:08] and so you know that's why he said to
[42:10] some of the church that I preach on he
[42:12] said you know people nobody plck them
[42:15] out of the hand of God they plck
[42:17] themselves amen because they fail or
[42:21] they refuse to
[42:23] recognize the stars in their generation
[42:26] the star in their generation amen so if
[42:29] you are identified thank God I am I'm
[42:33] identified with one of those Seven Stars
[42:38] so no one can pla me out of his hand
[42:41] because I am fully
[42:44] represented in the arm of the Lord
[42:47] hallelujah and so now that's the reason
[42:50] we seek Him diligently seek Him seek the
[42:54] person amen amen amen seek him that
[42:59] maketh the Seven Stars in ryion and said
[43:02] now so you see uh uh uh let me quote and
[43:06] again brother bam said now we see
[43:09] Paul a little old hook NOS Jew on his
[43:12] Road arrogant going down to bind them
[43:14] people making that noise and shouting
[43:16] and things throwing them in jail making
[43:19] Havoc of the church Stone Steen witness
[43:22] to it and held their coats he was a
[43:25] terror
[43:27] how would God ever choose a man like
[43:30] that Amen in man's
[43:33] choosing
[43:35] God uh uh Paul
[43:38] failed to meet man's requirement to be
[43:42] among the apostles prise God to man
[43:46] according to man's standards and
[43:50] choosing he cannot feel the missing part
[43:55] among the 12 apostles
[43:58] amen and said and look the Bishops all
[44:03] the apostles they said we'll make a
[44:05] choice somebody to take judas's place
[44:09] and who they choose they chose
[44:12] Maas Maas I believe it's called Maas
[44:15] yeah Matias they chose him by casting
[44:17] lots and not one thing did he ever do he
[44:21] seemed to be a righteous man and God
[44:24] chose the most high-tempered meanest guy
[44:27] there was in the land to take his place
[44:30] and said it's a paradox but that's what
[44:33] God
[44:34] does
[44:36] paradox amen it's hard to understand but
[44:41] that's what
[44:44] God that that's how God do it now if we
[44:50] if we read in in the background here the
[44:54] apostles they were looking for something
[44:57] thing and because now they had Judas all
[45:01] these
[45:02] years
[45:05] amen and Jesus from the very
[45:08] beginning
[45:10] knew am that Judas was a son of
[45:18] predition but Jesus Jesus knowing who he
[45:22] was am he could
[45:24] stand a Judas among the
[45:28] group and even gave him position in the
[45:34] church and God makes no
[45:37] mistakes he knew what he was doing amen
[45:41] so he gave that position so that
[45:44] eventually at the end Judas will expose
[45:49] himself Hallelujah and so now but if
[45:53] you're going to see when when Judas was
[45:56] out of of his place and now they had to
[45:59] choose and and in verse 15 in in in
[46:02] chapter 1 let's see uh one more on this
[46:06] background said and in those days Peter
[46:08] stood up in the midst of the disciples
[46:10] and said the number of names together
[46:13] were about
[46:14] 120 and he said men and Brethren this
[46:17] scripture must needs have been fulfilled
[46:19] which the Holy Ghost but the mouth of
[46:22] David spake before concerning Judas
[46:25] which was guide to them that took Jesus
[46:28] and he said for he was numbered with us
[46:32] and had obtained part of this
[46:37] ministry
[46:39] amen so now when there people in this
[46:44] generation that had obtained
[46:48] part they
[46:50] enjoyed a part of this
[46:53] ministry but later on they fulfilled as
[46:58] the scripture said like you know amen
[47:01] The Same Spirit and and in verse 25 he
[47:04] said that he may take part of this
[47:06] ministry and apostleship from which
[47:08] Judas by transgression fell that he
[47:12] might go to his own
[47:15] place wow amen so this shows us that
[47:20] this person all throughout he was he was
[47:23] occupying a space that did not belong to
[47:27] him that's right amen amen and God
[47:32] permitted that to happen for a certain
[47:35] purpose that he should be betay that he
[47:37] should be betrayed amen that he will be
[47:40] rejected that he will be you know H uh
[47:43] uh brought into into the court and he
[47:46] will be accused wrongly amen so that the
[47:49] very purpose of him coming to Earth to
[47:52] redeem his own must be fulfilled so all
[47:55] things work together for forgive for to
[47:57] them that love him amen so you see now
[48:01] for for for h h all those years Judas
[48:05] amen occupied a space occupied a portion
[48:08] in the ministry but this portion did not
[48:12] belong to him in any
[48:16] way and it's not the other disciples
[48:19] that kick him out amen it's the
[48:22] situation it's the
[48:25] circumstances amen until he was exposed
[48:28] later on so of course and
[48:31] now they realize they miss a peace it's
[48:36] no longer
[48:37] complete amen and they had to do
[48:41] something amen and
[48:44] so they did the right thing in verse
[48:48] 24 and they
[48:50] prayed and said thou Lord which knowest
[48:54] the hearts of all men you whether of
[48:58] these two thou Hast
[49:03] chosen amen so there is a component
[49:08] there that disciple the disciples did
[49:12] they
[49:13] prayed and they asked the Lord to lead
[49:18] them to the to their
[49:23] choices amen but among the two
[49:28] amen but that's the only choices they
[49:30] gave
[49:34] God Amen sometimes we put God in a
[49:37] certain place you know we put God in a
[49:40] certain box and we give him
[49:43] option we limit God to what he can do in
[49:47] our lives amen because we want to
[49:50] accomplish something we want to do
[49:52] something and we're praying yeah amen
[49:56] but actually we're praying and forcing
[49:59] God to choose among our own
[50:05] options and God gave it to
[50:08] them yeah right but the timing was
[50:12] wrong amen and the options they gave
[50:17] God was
[50:19] limited
[50:21] hallelujah amen so at least God gave
[50:25] them the better am Ong the
[50:28] two amen hallelujah so your election is
[50:34] coming amen
[50:38] and and there's only two
[50:43] choices amen but you know uh uh we were
[50:47] talking about you know whoever whoever
[50:51] uh wins the election in in the United
[50:53] States amen I said this this is just me
[50:57] and said you know it's they will they
[50:59] will
[51:00] fulfill
[51:03] prophecy Amen in some way God has placed
[51:08] America
[51:11] amen that you you or the whole world is
[51:15] left with nothing with no choice but to
[51:18] fulfill a
[51:20] prophecy amen if Cala wins amen the
[51:24] woman president is literally fulfill
[51:27] bu if Donald wins others will say this
[51:31] going to be the last
[51:33] [Laughter]
[51:39] Trump no choice amen because there's
[51:43] only two choices amen but you see amen
[51:47] God you know he he's going to place us
[51:50] in a certain position we will be placed
[51:52] in a corner where we have no option
[51:56] amen but thank God Amen we realize who
[52:00] we are we know what time we are living
[52:02] in and we identify ourselves in the
[52:05] scripture and we are fulfilling prophecy
[52:09] amen so now you see now he said God but
[52:12] you know in the you know we know the
[52:14] rest of the story amen butam said Matias
[52:17] was men's
[52:20] Choice amen but it came later that God's
[52:24] choice was Paul amen but Paul could not
[52:27] meet human standard because you know he
[52:31] was a witness he he he consented on the
[52:34] death of the first Marty amen he's not
[52:37] he he he could not be as as good as
[52:41] Matias amen but God is
[52:44] absolute amen God Amen uh uh uh God is
[52:49] absolute so now to give us a a a a a a
[52:55] hint in the message hear ye himm he said
[52:58] in in in paragraph 10 he said but
[53:00] there's not one scripture in the entire
[53:04] Bible but what will dve tail and connect
[53:07] with the next
[53:09] scripture every bit of it is one great
[53:13] big
[53:14] picture all the way from the Garden of
[53:17] Eden and the way of Calvary back to the
[53:20] Garden again just one great beautiful
[53:24] picture so the Bible amen when we talk
[53:27] about a a love story amen there is one
[53:32] great picture the greatest love story
[53:36] and amen and and and that is between the
[53:37] bride and the bridegroom everything
[53:40] falls into uh into its place to fulfill
[53:44] God's greatest love story amen so he
[53:47] said from Genesis Amen to Revelation and
[53:50] I do not mean to be Sac religious he
[53:51] said by making this mistake or this
[53:54] statement and if it's a mistake God for
[53:56] forgive me but it's like a jigo puzzle
[53:59] that you have to putting it together you
[54:03] have the Holy Spirit you have to have
[54:06] the Holy Spirit to put it together just
[54:09] like on the jigo pule you get the
[54:11] picture to one side and look at the
[54:14] picture and then place it according to
[54:17] the way the picture looks based on God's
[54:23] point of view yeah amen
[54:26] that's why we always go back Amen to the
[54:29] original pattern where God H uh
[54:34] ordained according to his perfect will
[54:37] amen amen that's why in this generation
[54:40] amen we don't stop we seek amen though
[54:43] we we seek him that maketh those Stars
[54:47] amen we don't stop on the prophet per se
[54:50] amen but we move on we keep pressing on
[54:53] until we get un into the mind of God
[54:57] Amen where we where we are being
[54:59] restored not only uh uh back to the
[55:03] original Fai of the Apostles amen but we
[55:06] we move amen back to the Garden of Eden
[55:10] where where we see how everything
[55:12] started where all the seeds started amen
[55:16] and we don't stop there also through
[55:18] this message of the hour amen this
[55:20] message did not only bring H brought did
[55:22] not only bring us back to the pain of
[55:25] the Apostles where we have the original
[55:27] the original Apostles Doctrine so forth
[55:30] and so on from baptism from the simple
[55:32] things amen but you know it brought us
[55:35] back to the Garden of Eden what what
[55:38] what what originally happened there and
[55:40] so we realize amen how important is it
[55:44] is when we realize what happened in the
[55:46] Garden of Eden then we have a better
[55:49] understanding of the new birth amen
[55:51] hallelujah and it didn't stop just right
[55:53] there amen we're being not just in the
[55:55] beginning but we're being backed further
[55:59] to
[56:00] Eternity
[56:01] hallelujah hallelujah so we see now and
[56:05] and and and and and now we're thinking
[56:07] not the way we we we think but we think
[56:11] the way God
[56:13] thinks
[56:15] Hallelujah because the
[56:19] prophets this our messenger of this
[56:21] generation prophets are
[56:23] seers and they See
[56:27] Vision not just like a
[56:31] movie being played in front of
[56:35] them and that they will see things but
[56:38] the prophet of God said God pick them
[56:42] up and place them so that they will be
[56:46] able to
[56:48] see amen they will be personal witness
[56:53] they will have personal account
[56:56] of
[56:57] things so God pick the prophet in this
[57:02] generation and place him in his
[57:05] mind so that he can see he can tell us
[57:10] what's in the mind of
[57:12] God what a witness we have hallelujah
[57:17] amen so now he said the we're placing in
[57:22] every in in every piece amen we we are
[57:26] occupying each one of us has a space in
[57:29] the body in the mystical Body of Christ
[57:31] so that's why I cannot be brother Chad
[57:33] brother Chad cannot be me amen both
[57:36] brother Chad and myself cannot be
[57:37] brother nessar or the rest of the
[57:39] ministers we are all unique in some way
[57:44] amen we cannot just imitate somebody
[57:47] because our portion in the body is
[57:51] dedicated only for
[57:54] us so you are occupy a space in the body
[57:59] that no one can fit except you am amen
[58:04] so now let's go back here in Luke
[58:07] chapter 15 as we go on with this Parable
[58:09] he said now either what woman having 10
[58:12] pieces of silver if she lose one
[58:16] piece there are three steps that this
[58:20] woman did number one he lighted the
[58:24] candle
[58:27] and swept the house and seek diligently
[58:32] till she find it Hallelujah so the three
[58:38] steps and God is always perfect in three
[58:40] now he said now uh bana made mention of
[58:44] of uh of uh of a a brother and a sister
[58:48] and they went to a certain place and
[58:50] then they went down and then suddenly uh
[58:53] a person accidentally
[58:56] uh L's back on the light switch amen and
[59:02] the light went off and they could not
[59:05] see
[59:06] anything
[59:07] amen and so the younger sister was
[59:11] shouting and crying hollering and said
[59:14] amen because uh uh she was so afraid
[59:17] because she could not see anything amen
[59:21] but the responsible brother said don't
[59:24] worry amen and he said don't worry amen
[59:29] relax because there is a
[59:32] man there is a man amen that can turn on
[59:36] the light amen so it's the same thing
[59:39] today we have found we seek the man
[59:43] Hallelujah that can actually turn on the
[59:45] light and that's the very reason we see
[59:48] every detail that we need up in this
[59:51] Earthly Journey amen so he said now when
[59:54] we see those things see things that are
[59:56] out of place things that you know and
[59:58] brother bham said you know when you when
[1:00:00] you come to realize you're out of place
[1:00:02] and then you look at your homes you look
[1:00:04] at your uh uh uh even into the churches
[1:00:07] you know so there's there's something
[1:00:09] that will move you amen and the next
[1:00:12] thing that you do when you when you turn
[1:00:14] on the light and by said the next thing
[1:00:18] that you have to do is to do house
[1:00:19] cleaning amen
[1:00:22] hallelujah and and then when you Place
[1:00:26] everything and then you find out there's
[1:00:30] something that is out of place or
[1:00:32] something that is
[1:00:34] missing
[1:00:36] Hallelujah have you experienced going to
[1:00:39] a holiday and uh everybody's prepared
[1:00:42] the food amen everything the hotels
[1:00:44] where you're going to and then everybody
[1:00:47] is in the van
[1:00:49] amen and then suddenly when you're going
[1:00:52] to start the van you lost the key
[1:00:57] you don't have the key that's a small
[1:01:01] piece amen but you cannot you cannot
[1:01:04] leave home you can't leave the compound
[1:01:05] you're not you're not going to enjoy the
[1:01:07] holiday you have been planning for so
[1:01:09] long A Time amen because you're missing
[1:01:12] a simple
[1:01:13] piece hallelujah amen and so now
[1:01:17] everybody you know everybody will go
[1:01:19] back but you see when you when you're
[1:01:21] looking for the key and there there's
[1:01:23] only one thing sure amen you you you
[1:01:26] drove back your
[1:01:29] car that means you didn't leave the key
[1:01:33] anywhere
[1:01:34] else all right amen and brother Benham
[1:01:38] said this woman mentioned in the parable
[1:01:42] amen was not a
[1:01:45] prostitute because in during those time
[1:01:49] when when a woman you know in our days
[1:01:53] we uh H uh when there's a wedding
[1:01:56] uh there's a wedding ring right but
[1:01:59] brother bam said in the Oriental Customs
[1:02:02] amen they don't have the ring but they
[1:02:04] have
[1:02:04] tablets amen and all the these tablets
[1:02:08] represent each one represented a virtue
[1:02:12] and it shows that a woman is married
[1:02:16] amen so that shows amen and it is
[1:02:20] publicly uh uh publicly known amen but
[1:02:25] if a woman woman in the absence of her
[1:02:28] husband maybe she's a he's a soldier and
[1:02:31] and he has to fought amen uh uh in
[1:02:34] another country another place amen and
[1:02:37] and he had to go back so when he goes
[1:02:41] back and something is missing in those
[1:02:45] tablets that means uh uh she lived as
[1:02:49] Unfaithful in the absence of her husband
[1:02:52] so that was a customary during those
[1:02:55] days it was was part of their culture
[1:02:57] amen but brother mam said declared that
[1:02:59] this woman in the parable was not a
[1:03:02] prostitute she was a faithful woman amen
[1:03:06] but accidentally or something happened
[1:03:09] amen uh uh probably when when she was
[1:03:12] doing something anden she lost one of
[1:03:15] the
[1:03:17] pieces Hallelujah and then as she face
[1:03:20] the mirror she look and she notice
[1:03:23] something is missing
[1:03:25] Hallelujah and brother bham said she did
[1:03:28] not go to the neighbor she did not go
[1:03:30] wherever amen hallelujah no need to go
[1:03:34] to Walmart or or anything amen but she
[1:03:37] knew right there that it was only
[1:03:42] misplaced amen it's in there in the
[1:03:46] inner house because she's a faithful
[1:03:49] wife I believe the Bride of the Lord
[1:03:51] Jesus Christ is a faithful woman but
[1:03:53] just something along the way have
[1:03:56] happened something you know uh uh uh uh
[1:03:59] uh things beyond our control you know
[1:04:02] things sometimes we're being trap or we
[1:04:04] do things but that that you know but you
[1:04:07] see this woman amen this woman
[1:04:11] realize that she is missing
[1:04:16] something one among the
[1:04:19] 10 tablets or coins is
[1:04:24] missing Hallelujah
[1:04:26] so sometimes you know we're looking for
[1:04:29] something sometimes even in our
[1:04:31] household in the family sometimes we're
[1:04:33] looking for answers outside our home
[1:04:38] amen sometimes what we're looking for is
[1:04:40] just in our home Hallelujah sometimes
[1:04:44] relationship is almost going into
[1:04:46] breakdown amen we cannot we can no
[1:04:49] longer move on because of things amen
[1:04:51] and sometimes you know people you
[1:04:54] know uh
[1:04:56] uh uh a lot of people they
[1:04:59] drink wine you know not to justify not
[1:05:03] to justify and not I'm not I'm not
[1:05:05] encouraging you know that if you have
[1:05:07] problem you go to drink wine or go to
[1:05:10] some other fellowships amen but not
[1:05:12] everybody are bad people but they're
[1:05:15] just looking for some
[1:05:17] fellowship because they're looking for
[1:05:20] something they're missing
[1:05:22] something amen they're finding something
[1:05:26] that could
[1:05:27] satisfy amen what they were looking for
[1:05:32] and they cannot find it at
[1:05:34] home Hallelujah and that's why brother
[1:05:36] brandham said you know what we have to
[1:05:38] do is that we make our home
[1:05:41] nice so their family our children will
[1:05:44] always miss going back home because we
[1:05:48] have a nice that is a home that is so
[1:05:51] nice amen fulfilling amen the word of
[1:05:55] God in this this generation so just like
[1:05:58] that woman amen just you you remember
[1:06:00] that woman at the
[1:06:03] well when he met when she met the
[1:06:07] Lord she already had six
[1:06:12] men because when the Lord asked her call

[1:06:20] husband and Jesus said yes you said
[1:06:23] right because you had five and the six
[1:06:26] that you have is still not your husband
[1:06:29] amen
[1:06:31] amen but you know the B of God said you
[1:06:35] know this woman because a woman needs a
[1:06:41] head as the bride needs the headship of
[1:06:43] Christ so this woman was looking for a
[1:06:47] rightful head that will take care of her
[1:06:50] in search of something Amen in search of
[1:06:54] something that you know could protect
[1:06:57] her somebody that could answer provide
[1:07:00] for her
[1:07:02] needs amen and again not to justify amen
[1:07:06] this woman leave one man after the other
[1:07:10] because she was looking for that missing
[1:07:14] pieace of her life amen amen and she was
[1:07:19] actually looking for the most important
[1:07:23] portion of herself and that is headship
[1:07:28] amen that's the reason she had
[1:07:31] six amen but
[1:07:34] because amen but
[1:07:37] because amen the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:07:41] the genuine head and that woman you know
[1:07:45] although the Lord was was going into
[1:07:47] another Direction but she felt a missing
[1:07:51] peace is in this direction anden he
[1:07:54] moved amen he stepped into this and went
[1:07:57] to that h h h well and he found that
[1:08:00] woman amen amen that was a missing peace
[1:08:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so he
[1:08:07] was the one who look for
[1:08:10] her right no wonder you are
[1:08:14] here you know we've been out there we
[1:08:17] didn't know who he is we didn't know
[1:08:20] amen we realize amen we're missing
[1:08:22] something we're looking for our lives
[1:08:24] we're looking for our future we're
[1:08:26] looking for something that will satisfy
[1:08:28] our desires amen something that will
[1:08:31] make us happy fulfilled and everything
[1:08:33] amen but we miss the target all those
[1:08:36] years amen but somewhere along the road
[1:08:38] Hallelujah somebody's also looking for
[1:08:41] her portion for his portion somebody's
[1:08:43] looking for that missing peace and I
[1:08:46] thank God Amen the Lord has found that
[1:08:49] missing peace and that's the reason you
[1:08:51] are here hallelujah because he found us
[1:08:55] amen amen amen he came down amen he
[1:09:01] became a servant he occupied Hallelujah
[1:09:04] the lowest the lowest
[1:09:08] portion just to find us amen and now
[1:09:13] we're occupying a portion Hallelujah so
[1:09:16] that's why you're here and he said now
[1:09:18] amen he said that's why amen he said
[1:09:21] it's later than we
[1:09:23] think we don't come to church just to
[1:09:27] occupy a
[1:09:29] few
[1:09:31] amen otherwise we're just
[1:09:34] members of a certain organization but we
[1:09:37] don't come to church to occupy a few we
[1:09:39] do not come to church to hear a good
[1:09:42] sermon amen

[1:10:38] matter how it hurts Hallelujah no matter

[1:10:45] kind of a rebuke a reminder of something
[1:10:47] of some sort Lord hallelujah let your
[1:10:50] will be done be it unto me Lord
[1:10:52] according to your word hallelujah we
[1:10:55] come here with open heart amen so that
[1:10:58] God can check our hearts because we are
[1:11:00] we're doing this we're in the last part
[1:11:03] of our journey amen and we do not want
[1:11:06] to commit mistake just because we have
[1:11:09] our own choosing that's amen hallelujah
[1:11:12] and so Jesus Christ God's son like like
[1:11:14] in this he said to a woman in her
[1:11:17] subject tonight we find this woman her
[1:11:19] husband had gone and she had lost one of
[1:11:22] the coins out of her tablet now in his
[1:11:25] said he he will try to explain that amen
[1:11:27] and he said so we see in the first verse
[1:11:31] in the next verse he said in Luke 15:9
[1:11:33] and when she had found
[1:11:36] it when we found
[1:11:39] something you know when she had found it
[1:11:45] she call it her
[1:11:46] friends and her neighbors together
[1:11:50] saying Rejoice with me for I have found
[1:11:54] the peace which I had lost Hallelujah
[1:11:58] all these years I'm looking for
[1:12:00] something so that's why we we we go out
[1:12:05] there we witness we evangelize not
[1:12:08] because an organization send us but it's
[1:12:12] because there
[1:12:15] is a joy Hallelujah immeasurable Joy
[1:12:20] we're just testifying that I have found
[1:12:24] something that all these years I'm
[1:12:27] looking Hallelujah the thing that I have
[1:12:30] been missing something that have you
[1:12:32] know I look for all these things I mean
[1:12:35] I look in in in the word looking for
[1:12:37] some friends looking for some uh H
[1:12:39] organization religious group whatsoever
[1:12:42] it is I'm looking for
[1:12:44] personalities Sports everything
[1:12:47] Hallelujah but none of those things
[1:12:50] satisfied me and completed my search
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:56] Hallelujah until I found him thank you
[1:13:00] Lord Jesus Hallelujah and he said for I
[1:13:03] have found the peace which I had
[1:13:06] lost
[1:13:08] amen and what this did this woman lost
[1:13:13] he said
[1:13:15] now he knows that if the
[1:13:19] people get the true revelation of the
[1:13:23] true church
[1:13:25] now we're giving the the the message is
[1:13:27] giving us a clue yes why there's only
[1:13:31] nine and there's a missing peace amise
[1:13:36] God because you can have
[1:13:39] all this
[1:13:41] gifts but in the absence of Revelation
[1:13:45] amen that's it right amen
[1:13:50] right that's why
[1:13:52] Satan hates revelation
[1:13:55] amen he can he can manifest he can
[1:13:59] show all these
[1:14:03] gifts might be you know uh uh might be
[1:14:07] literally being witnessed before us but
[1:14:11] in the absence of
[1:14:13] Revelation and what keeps us
[1:14:16] going what keeps us happy
[1:14:20] Amen to keep serving the lord of all
[1:14:24] these trials of all these struggles amen
[1:14:27] but because we have a
[1:14:29] revelation that all things work together
[1:14:31] for good thank God for that Revelation
[1:14:35] Hallelujah so we're not just aiming
[1:14:37] asking for all these gifts to be made
[1:14:40] manifest but we're asking Revelation
[1:14:42] from the Lord because that is what
[1:14:45] stimulates our faith that is what
[1:14:48] stimulates the word that we are hearing
[1:14:51] you might be hearing the same word you
[1:14:53] might be hearing the same sermon but but
[1:14:55] in the absence of Revelation that comes
[1:14:57] from the Lord we will miss the target
[1:14:59] glory to God Amen so he said now he
[1:15:03] knows that if the people get the true
[1:15:06] revelation of the true church and what
[1:15:09] she is and what she stands for and she
[1:15:12] can do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:15:14] invincible
[1:15:16] Army so if they the bride get a true
[1:15:20] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:15:22] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:15:25] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:15:28] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:15:30] powerless before her he will be as
[1:15:33] definitely tarted today as when Christ
[1:15:36] with stood his every effort to gain
[1:15:38] power over him in the desert yes Satan
[1:15:42] hates Revelation but we love
[1:15:46] it
[1:15:47] Hallelujah that completes the
[1:15:50] pieces amen he said Satan hates
[1:15:53] Revelation but we love it with through
[1:15:56] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[1:15:58] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[1:16:00] will prevail over them so what import it
[1:16:04] is so important that's why when we get
[1:16:06] the Revelation we're not confused amen
[1:16:10] you know why other religious
[1:16:11] organization can can manifest all the
[1:16:15] similar things amen now when we get the
[1:16:19] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:16:23] framework of the church
[1:16:25] then we are not
[1:16:27] confused because we have the great re
[1:16:30] the true Revelation and he said the
[1:16:33] Bible said now if the true church get
[1:16:36] the true Revelation and what she
[1:16:40] is and what she stands for she can do
[1:16:44] Greater Works amen hallelujah so that's
[1:16:49] why you remember that that uh
[1:16:52] illustration that brother brandham said
[1:16:55] uh he said there was there was a young
[1:16:57] boy who lived in the countryside and
[1:17:00] never seen a mirror all his
[1:17:03] life amen but suddenly amen one of the
[1:17:06] relatives invited them and and and and
[1:17:09] then he was walking in in the home and
[1:17:11] then he passed by a mirror amen and as
[1:17:14] he passed by that mirror he saw somebody
[1:17:17] and he was scared initially amen so he
[1:17:21] thought he was alone but suddenly he saw
[1:17:24] somebody
[1:17:25] amen and then when he when he got all
[1:17:28] his you know he put all his emotion and
[1:17:31] become bre a little bit amen and he just
[1:17:34] stop and look at the
[1:17:36] mirror amen and as he look at the mirror
[1:17:40] he moved one of his hands and that guy
[1:17:43] is imitating him and move another hand
[1:17:47] he's really doing what I do amen and
[1:17:50] then suddenly he realized amen then then
[1:17:53] he R to his mother and he said said Mama
[1:17:56] I saw myself that's me in the mirror
[1:18:00] it's the same thing when we are reading
[1:18:02] the scripture this is our mirror amen
[1:18:05] when we look at the stature of a perfect
[1:18:07] man amen we see and we see all these
[1:18:09] steps Hallelujah we see amen little by
[1:18:12] little amen it's not just something amen
[1:18:16] uh it's not just a program it's not a
[1:18:18] Creed it's not uh a method of good
[1:18:21] living Hallelujah but the word tells us
[1:18:24] there is a bride that is pure that is
[1:18:26] perfect Hallelujah that uh he will
[1:18:29] present to himself without wrinkles amen
[1:18:32] and suddenly we said that's
[1:18:37] me that's why God separated
[1:18:41] us hallelujah from the rest of the
[1:18:44] Christian world you realize you become
[1:18:47] an ODB to this world Hallelujah because
[1:18:51] God just made us so different glory to
[1:18:55] God Amen Hallelujah so now he said uh uh
[1:19:00] when we that that's why when we see uh
[1:19:03] uh when we testify he said and when she
[1:19:05] had found it she called it her friends
[1:19:07] and her neighbors together saying
[1:19:08] Rejoice with me for I have found the
[1:19:10] peace which I had lost then we come to
[1:19:13] go out as a witness and we are given a
[1:19:15] certain responsibility that this truth
[1:19:18] will not stop only with
[1:19:20] us but when we realize there's still
[1:19:24] something out there Amen brother bham
[1:19:27] once said amen it's not fair that we are
[1:19:31] hearing this message time and time again
[1:19:34] we hear we hear this message many times
[1:19:37] but there's still people out there that
[1:19:39] have not heard the message not even a
[1:19:43] single time Hallelujah then we realize
[1:19:47] and then we we we place then the holy
[1:19:49] spirit that called us amen has led us
[1:19:52] into a certain position and then we
[1:19:54] speak as the Holy Spirit say
[1:19:57] come Hallelujah we just testified and he
[1:20:01] said so we realize what he said that's
[1:20:03] the reason Christ has to say in his
[1:20:05] mediatorial seat back there as an
[1:20:07] intercessor until that last one comes in
[1:20:10] at the last age and this Revelation then
[1:20:12] of what he has been breaks forth upon
[1:20:15] the people and they see what's happened
[1:20:18] amen so he said now amen he has moved
[1:20:22] amen from his throne into the Throne of
[1:20:25] our hearts and that's why we go out
[1:20:28] there hallelujah amen because we peel
[1:20:32] the burden the mercy is being placed
[1:20:35] upon us amen then when you realize amen
[1:20:39] that greatest atonement is in your heart
[1:20:42] Hallelujah you realize now amen there's
[1:20:45] always you know there's always the World
[1:20:47] War I all these wars and rumors of War
[1:20:49] amen is always almost going to happen
[1:20:52] but it's not happening yet because we
[1:20:55] still have one out there amen amen and
[1:20:59] their only
[1:21:01] hope is you
[1:21:03] amen because you hold in your hand you
[1:21:07] have in your heart am the grace of the
[1:21:10] Lord
[1:21:11] amen amen and because of us people will
[1:21:15] realize they need salvation amen the
[1:21:18] world will realize Hallelujah there is
[1:21:21] redemption and there is room at the
[1:21:24] cross all the time amen amen hallelujah
[1:21:29] and so now uh in in in in in the
[1:21:32] prophet's
[1:21:33] illustration you know uh he used all
[1:21:35] these terms Capstone headstone cheap
[1:21:38] Cornerstone the KE the Keystone
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:44] but I believe they speak the same
[1:21:49] thing amen because the cheap Cornerstone
[1:21:52] that was rejected that's Christ
[1:21:55] amen the head of the Bride The Headstone
[1:21:58] is Christ amen uh uh the pyramid amen
[1:22:04] the pyramid brother bham said there is
[1:22:05] no cstone being put on
[1:22:08] it so even in the natural
[1:22:12] pyramid they miss a missing
[1:22:17] piece but we know that in this
[1:22:20] generation the last piece of the
[1:22:23] puzzle must be laid on Amen Hallelujah
[1:22:29] so the cup is Christ the head is Christ
[1:22:32] the chief Corner amen and the stone amen
[1:22:36] when he when he spoke to Peter he said
[1:22:39] amen Peter what do people say I the son
[1:22:41] of man am he said oh you're you're they
[1:22:44] say you are among the prophets you're
[1:22:46] Elijah Jeremiah amen and or one of the
[1:22:48] prophets but how about you Peter what is
[1:22:52] your personal
[1:22:57] Revelation because this is the peace
[1:22:59] that they miss what is your personal
[1:23:02] revelation of who the son of man am and
[1:23:06] Peter said Thou Art Christ the son of
[1:23:09] the Living God hallelujah Peter you have
[1:23:12] not learned it you have not heard it
[1:23:14] from anyone but my father is in heaven
[1:23:17] rebuild it unto you and Upon This Rock
[1:23:21] upon this great Stone upon this
[1:23:24] revelation of who I am upon this
[1:23:28] revelation of what the real cup is and
[1:23:31] who is your head is and who is your key
[1:23:34] is amen it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ and it's the revelation of the
[1:23:40] word hallelujah amen thank you Lord so
[1:23:43] it's exactly placing us amen and when we
[1:23:47] realize when we get the true revelation
[1:23:50] of who we are and what you are and what
[1:23:55] you stand for then you know how to
[1:23:58] conduct yourself Hallelujah and we can
[1:24:02] lay the last missing pieace and because
[1:24:06] of that Hallelujah
[1:24:08] sometimes you know uh uh people don't
[1:24:13] realize that when they hear the word of
[1:24:16] God you know all of us are fulfilling
[1:24:19] something as we have said you're not
[1:24:22] just sitting there to occupy of you
[1:24:25] you're not just a visitor here you are
[1:24:30] not an accident to come by
[1:24:34] here God place you here for a certain
[1:24:40] purpose amen and no matter how little
[1:24:43] our participation is in the body it is
[1:24:46] important you are important I am
[1:24:50] important as you are Hallelujah so I so
[1:24:54] so I believe Hallelujah that you will
[1:24:57] not be complete without brother
[1:24:59] Dany I'm not complete without you amen
[1:25:03] because we occupy a portion in the body
[1:25:07] amen hallelujah until we fully complete
[1:25:10] God's purpose in our lives amen uh just
[1:25:14] like in uh you know in in a certain
[1:25:16] Orchestra where you know there are

[1:26:46] certain Climax and and and you know uh
[1:26:49] the director is giving all he got and
[1:26:51] all the instruments all the violin you
[1:26:53] know putting all their hearts together
[1:26:56] amen and suddenly amen that portion he
[1:26:59] just
[1:27:05] said that's all she has to
[1:27:09] do right but without
[1:27:14] it the music is not complete amen it is
[1:27:20] one of the
[1:27:21] details of that musical piece
[1:27:26] Hallelujah you might be sitting there
[1:27:28] and you don't know what to do you might
[1:27:30] be sitting there and Lord what what
[1:27:32] should I do I want to be a a a a you
[1:27:35] know I want to be an active member of
[1:27:38] the body God is the holy spirit that's
[1:27:41] place in you there and you're just like
[1:27:44] that somebody who's holding that piece
[1:27:46] of
[1:27:47] triangle and and when you do your
[1:27:50] portion you complete the musical piece
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] hallelujah amen thank you Lord you love
[1:27:59] him this morning amen and so now all
[1:28:03] these things God makes us and so it's
[1:28:06] it's it's the revelation of who we are
[1:28:09] is the revelation of what we have to do
[1:28:12] and and and because of that by knowing
[1:28:13] it we will be an effective member of the
[1:28:17] body amen one time brother Benham was
[1:28:19] answered was questioned he said h h h
[1:28:22] the question was he said brother benam
[1:28:25] would the bride of Christ have would the
[1:28:27] bride of Christ have a Ministry before
[1:28:29] the Rapture yes and brother man said
[1:28:32] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:28:35] the bride of Christ certainly it is the
[1:28:37] message of the hour the bride of Christ
[1:28:40] sure she consist of Apostles prophets
[1:28:44] teachers evangelists and pastors is that
[1:28:46] right that's the bride of Christ that
[1:28:49] she's got a Ministry a great ministry
[1:28:53] and I like how the prophet closed this
[1:28:56] paragraph he said he's got a Ministry
[1:28:59] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:29:02] hour it will be so
[1:29:08] humble amen hallelujah remember the
[1:29:12] Rapture is a secret catching away yeah
[1:29:15] right it's not even
[1:29:19] making noise for the whole world to see
[1:29:23] what's going on Amen it's a secret
[1:29:26] catching
[1:29:28] away amen there is silence
[1:29:31] somewhere because there is an invisible
[1:29:34] Union taking place but in this world you
[1:29:37] know we live in the world you know we're
[1:29:40] social
[1:29:42] media and
[1:29:45] everything that everybody wants to be on
[1:29:48] top everyone everybody wants to be
[1:29:51] noticed
[1:29:54] but the Propet of God said the ministry
[1:29:56] the last
[1:29:59] piece of God's Ministry of the Bride it
[1:30:02] will be so
[1:30:05] humble I'm not saying we have to be
[1:30:08] silent and we don't have to say Amen you
[1:30:11] know I jump when I F the Holy Spirit you
[1:30:13] know uh although H uh I understand you
[1:30:18] know that all these expression these are
[1:30:20] just expression but it's the holy spirit
[1:30:23] amen placing us into the body of Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ amen and that is what we really
[1:30:30] uh uh uh uh need to know amen and so uhh
[1:30:34] even the prophet of God Amen even the
[1:30:36] prophet of God one time you
[1:30:40] know he's the prophet of this generation
[1:30:44] but did you remember one time he was
[1:30:47] standing right at that huge
[1:30:52] building and he said
[1:30:55] Lord you know reminding about Orel
[1:30:58] Roberts and THL osbor look what they've
[1:31:02] got
[1:31:03] amen I done hope all these things amen
[1:31:09] probably you know he said he said when I
[1:31:12] stood outside
[1:31:13] there we just couldn't hardly get my
[1:31:17] breath from such
[1:31:19] Majesty that a poor boy born in a Dugout
[1:31:23] a Pentecost costal could do and bring
[1:31:26] that into that great Mammoth
[1:31:29] building and I thought oh
[1:31:31] God maybe I am not
[1:31:36] worthy just then a little voice came
[1:31:38] down through those corridors and
[1:31:41] said but I am your
[1:31:46] portion
[1:31:48] Hallelujah when I read this I come to
[1:31:52] realize amen
[1:31:54] God has se truly separated us amen you
[1:31:57] know that our faith blessing is not just
[1:32:01] the things that we see
[1:32:03] outside
[1:32:05] amen because he said this physical
[1:32:08] expression though God is able to do that
[1:32:11] amen this is not the
[1:32:13] basis but this basis is election amen
[1:32:18] that we are part of being the Beloved
[1:32:21] but look the prophet of this gener ation
[1:32:24] was not
[1:32:26] excused when he saw all these things
[1:32:30] that these two ministers you know have
[1:32:34] you know have gotten that kind of
[1:32:36] inspiration from his ministry till
[1:32:39] Osborne until now he is
[1:32:41] testifying about the ministry that he
[1:32:44] witnessed upon brother Brenham
[1:32:48] Hallelujah and so now he said but you
[1:32:50] see but
[1:32:52] Lord maybe I I
[1:32:54] I'm not able to handle all these things
[1:32:57] I don't have the capacity amen but we we
[1:33:00] could feel what's behind amen what's
[1:33:03] behind those
[1:33:04] statements
[1:33:06] Hallelujah but brothers and
[1:33:08] sisters when we come to realize that
[1:33:11] when we open our
[1:33:12] hearts and we have we we give a portion
[1:33:16] a space there that God will occupy amen
[1:33:20] and then we realize that he is our
[1:33:23] portion
[1:33:24] and when he becomes our portion there's
[1:33:27] nothing we can ask for am am that
[1:33:31] completes amen that F all the cracks in
[1:33:35] our
[1:33:36] lives because he is our
[1:33:40] portion Hallelujah so now
[1:33:44] everything that we that we have need of
[1:33:47] you know even even even Paul amen when
[1:33:50] when when he come to the point at the
[1:33:52] end of his journey of life amen he was
[1:33:56] going you know to to the place where he
[1:33:59] will be offered he said I did my time
[1:34:02] has come this my time to be offered but
[1:34:06] brother brandham said am mean that was
[1:34:08] the
[1:34:09] ceiling of Paul's
[1:34:13] Ministry and what was the ceiling of his
[1:34:17] ministry when he was just right there
[1:34:20] and he is going to be martyred
[1:34:24] Hallelujah he was being and and and and
[1:34:27] brother brenon made mention about you
[1:34:30] know uh uh even his own life even his
[1:34:33] ministry he mentioned Demas he mentioned
[1:34:36] all you know any experience but all
[1:34:39] these things e even the life you know
[1:34:41] even the life of
[1:34:44] Spurgeon I read a portion of Spurgeon
[1:34:47] and he and he said in his life he had he
[1:34:51] had two years he said I had two years
[1:34:54] of the most bitterest
[1:34:57] experience to be
[1:34:59] [Laughter]
[1:35:01] betrayed but at the end Spurgeon said
[1:35:05] Lord all these years all my life I tried
[1:35:10] my best to build my
[1:35:12] reputation but at one time in the moment
[1:35:16] of my life somebody has to destroy it
[1:35:19] and it looks like I'm going to lose my
[1:35:22] reputation but Spurgeon said I'm
[1:35:24] repacing it you can search it if you
[1:35:26] want Spurgeon said but Lord amen now I
[1:35:31] realize I built all this reputation on
[1:35:34] myself I tried to be good I tried to be
[1:35:37] the best amen because I want to face you
[1:35:41] amen according to your perpose but now
[1:35:44] it seems like I'm losing my reputation
[1:35:46] but now I realize I'm losing my
[1:35:48] reputation not somebody has taken
[1:35:51] it but in that way
[1:35:54] I will be
[1:35:55] nothing so that only your
[1:35:58] reputation will come
[1:36:00] up Allelujah thank you Lord Jesus so
[1:36:05] sometimes and in the closing of this
[1:36:10] little sermon I would like to uh uh to
[1:36:13] close with the illustration that brother
[1:36:16] bham made mention when uh when he
[1:36:19] mentioned in one of his
[1:36:21] meetings uh and he mentioned about
[1:36:24] brother Edie
[1:36:25] Bisal you know about this in his
[1:36:28] illustration there is this uh grizzly
[1:36:31] bear and that Mammoth uh uh Beast with
[1:36:35] 42 in Horn amen and then there is one
[1:36:40] guy who's wearing a green checkered
[1:36:42] shirt you fully know the story but
[1:36:45] there's one point that I just want to
[1:36:46] leave with you this morning amen so in
[1:36:51] that in said said I have not been
[1:36:55] disobedient just like Paul to the
[1:36:57] Heavenly
[1:36:59] Bishop so in that
[1:37:02] illustration even his BR even uh uh the
[1:37:06] brother who's guiding him were even
[1:37:10] expressing some kind of a uh attitude
[1:37:15] that seemed to be doubting what was the
[1:37:17] what brother Bram was telling you know
[1:37:19] brother Bram I've been looking around
[1:37:21] you know and I could look so far and I
[1:37:24] cannot see any huge Beast down here
[1:37:29] amen but you see all these
[1:37:33] things you know all this H H uh what do
[1:37:38] you call this all this characters all
[1:37:40] these items all these pieces in the
[1:37:44] vision brother brandham said must come
[1:37:46] to pass he said
[1:37:49] everything that God have shown me in the
[1:37:53] entire Ministry of mine not a single
[1:37:57] time God
[1:37:59] failed and I saw that will happen and he
[1:38:04] was telling that story amen if you're
[1:38:06] going to uh uh to read the the the the
[1:38:09] the message or hear the message in the
[1:38:11] entitled proving his word I mean he said
[1:38:14] brother brother Eddie was Al when the
[1:38:16] lord gave me the vision about the bear
[1:38:18] and the Caribou amen so when when
[1:38:20] brother bham was relating this brother
[1:38:22] adisc and wife were in the
[1:38:24] audience amen and so now when he was
[1:38:27] telling this story amen so uh uh all the
[1:38:32] pieces amen were there now he said I saw
[1:38:36] now I saw the grizzly bear and the g the
[1:38:39] grizly bear amen uh when it stood before
[1:38:43] them it was so huge it's so monstrous
[1:38:46] and and and and the brother said butam
[1:38:49] amen in Your Vision you said that you
[1:38:51] shoot the Beast you shoot that bear why
[1:38:53] don't you why don't you shoot him right
[1:38:56] now and brother bam said no because in
[1:39:00] the vision I shoot him in the
[1:39:03] heart that means he was
[1:39:07] facing but brother brandham in no time
[1:39:11] when he faced Us in no time he can jump
[1:39:14] on us and just tore us to Pieces break
[1:39:18] us into pieces amen but I have to be
[1:39:22] obedient to the Henly Vision I shoot him
[1:39:25] in the heart and this rifle with that
[1:39:28] distance will not even touch him amen so
[1:39:32] he must be as at a certain distance amen
[1:39:36] and so when when when the grizzly bear
[1:39:39] Pace on
[1:39:40] them and and it and and and it s him and
[1:39:44] it s them amen he was ready to attack
[1:39:47] and brother Bram amen aimed the rifle
[1:39:51] and at a certain distance amen he shoot
[1:39:54] it and he and he said it looks like it
[1:39:56] didn't hurt
[1:39:57] him but suddenly amen it fell just few
[1:40:01] yards and it was so
[1:40:05] huge and then what about the
[1:40:08] caribou and what about the hand that
[1:40:11] reaches
[1:40:12] out amen so all these things must come
[1:40:16] to pass because it is thus sayth the
[1:40:19] Lord It's the pieces all the pieces must
[1:40:23] be there amen hallelujah so you know the
[1:40:27] story most of you know the story very
[1:40:29] well and so later on then the kibu came
[1:40:33] amen and when they were down there and
[1:40:35] they have to you know they have
[1:40:38] to to measure
[1:40:41] amen uh as as as the edge of the uh
[1:40:46] measuring tool is you know repeatedly
[1:40:50] it's
[1:40:51] falling and another hand
[1:40:54] must pick it up amen another must pick
[1:40:58] it up and so the vision that is show
[1:41:00] there is a hand that that reachs and and
[1:41:05] they they measure it from tip to tip and
[1:41:09] the brother said brother Brandon it's 42
[1:41:13] in
[1:41:16] perfect but what
[1:41:18] about the green checkered shirt
[1:41:24] amen and I heard the story that brother
[1:41:27] Ed Bisal was
[1:41:31] even asking sister Ruth to throw it
[1:41:36] maybe it's too old maybe it's not you
[1:41:39] know but uh from from Brother Ed's point
[1:41:44] of view it's better you you throw it
[1:41:47] amen and so when when when he left you
[1:41:50] know it was not by the Ed the beast
[1:41:52] that's why when brother bam asked is
[1:41:54] there anyone who's in green checkered
[1:41:56] shirt and brother Ed did
[1:41:59] not answer because he never knew that
[1:42:02] that green Checker chirt was there all
[1:42:06] right so
[1:42:09] now something has to happen that along
[1:42:14] the way brother Eddie Bisal stumbled or
[1:42:18] he sleep and he got dirty and wet and
[1:42:22] now now he has to
[1:42:25] change and he has to go back to his
[1:42:28] double bag and as he open it on top of
[1:42:33] that that's the last
[1:42:36] piece to
[1:42:38] make the vision
[1:42:41] complete and what will brother Ed do he
[1:42:45] picked that green checkered shirt and he
[1:42:48] wor it and when the prophet look here it
[1:42:52] is the last piece of the vision was
[1:42:57] being
[1:42:58] placed now let me leave this thought in
[1:43:02] your mind brothers and
[1:43:04] sisters the one who placed that green
[1:43:08] checkered
[1:43:09] shirt the last piece of that
[1:43:14] prophecy sister Ruth
[1:43:17] pisca was not
[1:43:20] there he was out of the picture he was
[1:43:24] behind the
[1:43:26] scene but the last
[1:43:28] piece that she laid there completed the
[1:43:34] vision in this day and
[1:43:36] age it's the bride on the
[1:43:40] sin but it's not
[1:43:43] something just like the third pool it's
[1:43:46] not a public show am the bride is behind
[1:43:51] the scene
[1:43:55] on the other side there might be people
[1:43:59] that will be shaking hands with you you
[1:44:02] don't
[1:44:03] know you don't
[1:44:05] realize what you're doing in the mission
[1:44:09] fieldj you don't realize what you're
[1:44:11] putting on into
[1:44:14] something but there are people out there
[1:44:17] who's hearing the gospel yes you're
[1:44:20] laying the last piece of the prophecy
[1:44:23] see to complete the vision in this last
[1:44:27] generation you're doing something that
[1:44:30] other people may not realize amen you're
[1:44:33] you're doing accomplishing something in
[1:44:35] the church maybe just praying in one
[1:44:38] corner praying for your pastor praying
[1:44:41] for the brother that is sick praying for
[1:44:43] somebody that you know amen is
[1:44:45] struggling and brother bam said when we
[1:44:47] pray for somebody we need to enter into
[1:44:50] their condition Hallelujah no one notice
[1:44:55] it but we place the last
[1:44:58] piece of the
[1:45:00] APLE Hallelujah we may be the last piece
[1:45:03] of the APLE it may be the last
[1:45:07] predestinated seed that will hear the
[1:45:09] message because they hear it through
[1:45:11] somebody that you sent out there amen
[1:45:15] they can go to the parang areas where we
[1:45:17] cannot go amen but there are
[1:45:19] missionaries that going to the parang
[1:45:21] areas crossing the sea amen climbing
[1:45:24] these mountains amen and everything and
[1:45:26] then on the other side he said I want to
[1:45:29] see amen that that that when I see that
[1:45:31] light that hovering covering circling
[1:45:34] that men on the other side and then at
[1:45:37] that point I will realize I have a
[1:45:39] portion in that you place the last

[1:51:38] reel
[1:51:40] amen oh that's the greatest thing the
[1:51:43] greatest peace is
[1:51:45] revelation I was so encouraged by the
[1:51:49] word today and you realize that
[1:51:53] uh when he went to the story of brother
[1:51:56] brandham started talking about brother
[1:51:57] brandham reflecting on his life in
[1:52:00] comparison to the great buildings and
[1:52:01] the great works of these men and you
[1:52:04] could see the humanity and brother
[1:52:06] Brenham the the the disappointment maybe
[1:52:08] feeling like he didn't measure up in
[1:52:10] some
[1:52:12] way but in his disappointment and maybe
[1:52:15] his
[1:52:16] confusion God gave him the greatest
[1:52:20] Revelation I am your portion
[1:52:23] amen oh may God make that a revelation
[1:52:26] for us today that he is our portion and
[1:52:29] if he's my portion what else do I need
[1:52:32] he's the greatest thing there
[1:52:34] is oh I'm so thankful to God and I pray
[1:52:37] that God would give that Revelation to
[1:52:40] each one of us that he is our portion
[1:52:43] that he's our head that he is the he is
[1:52:45] the missing piece in all of our Lives
[1:52:47] amen he's the great peace and may his
[1:52:50] love come down and cap Our Lives May the
[1:52:52] head ship Unite with us and may we find
[1:52:55] that missing portion that completes each
[1:52:58] one of us and if that be so then we will
[1:53:02] become the missing pieace the detail
[1:53:06] that this world needs to complete the
[1:53:07] picture of Christ because the picture of
[1:53:09] Christ is Christ United with his bride a
[1:53:12] many membered
[1:53:14] bride and what a reminder to not look to
[1:53:18] the great big things cuz if we're only
[1:53:21] looking to the big things we might be
[1:53:22] missing the key thing that God wants us
[1:53:24] to do just to live our
[1:53:27] portion I love the story he told of
[1:53:30] brother bisco and sister bisco how
[1:53:32] brother bisco had told her to throw away
[1:53:34] the shirt he didn't even want it anymore
[1:53:37] but it had a tear or something in it but
[1:53:39] she mended it and put it back in his
[1:53:42] bag you know she may have never known
[1:53:45] how important that was or what inspired
[1:53:47] her to fix it and put it back in you
[1:53:50] know there's some things that we don't
[1:53:51] even know that we're doing doing but we
[1:53:54] just have to trust that God's called us
[1:53:56] to fulfill a role and God has a purpose
[1:53:57] in our lives and just move forward as
[1:54:00] God leaves and live for him and let him
[1:54:02] sort it all
[1:54:04] out amen she put that in there and and
[1:54:07] all of the things transpired and and
[1:54:09] like the brother was saying it fulfilled
[1:54:11] the vision and she didn't even know that
[1:54:14] she was instrumental in the missing
[1:54:16] piece we may not know we may not even
[1:54:19] know what we're doing but we have to
[1:54:21] believe that
[1:54:23] he's my
[1:54:24] portion and he'll lead and guide me in
[1:54:27] every way that he wants me to live and
[1:54:28] God will get Glory out of my life and
[1:54:31] there come a day that she was sitting in
[1:54:32] a service and brother Brenham started
[1:54:34] telling that Serv story and maybe it was
[1:54:37] then that she realized how instrumental
[1:54:39] her part was that without her it would
[1:54:41] have never been
[1:54:42] fulfilled and I wonder if maybe just
[1:54:45] maybe at the wedding supper maybe as the
[1:54:48] as the bridegroom gets up and starts
[1:54:50] telling stories maybe it's then we real
[1:54:52] real ize the part that we play but I
[1:54:55] want to be faithful even if I don't know
[1:54:57] today even if I can't see it even if I
[1:54:59] can't measure it even if I can't measure
[1:55:01] it up to somebody else's great buildings
[1:55:04] I I help me God not to care that's The
[1:55:06] Human Side we all care about those
[1:55:08] things we all want to do our part but
[1:55:10] help me God to look beyond that and see
[1:55:12] my reward is you you're my portion
[1:55:15] you're my
[1:55:16] reward and maybe if we can be faithful
[1:55:19] to him in all things at the marriage
[1:55:21] supper he might might unfold the rest of
[1:55:23] the story we realize what our prayer our
[1:55:27] attendance our kindness our
[1:55:29] thoughtfulness our our word how
[1:55:31] instrumental it was to fulfill the
[1:55:34] vision along the
[1:55:35] way
[1:55:37] amen help me God I needed to hear
[1:55:40] this help me to quit looking for big
[1:55:43] things and help me to embrace my
[1:55:47] portion which is
[1:55:50] him help me to trust him to leave and
[1:55:52] guide me in the path of righteousness
[1:55:55] for his name's
[1:55:56] sake and whatever he wants out of my
[1:55:59] life that's what I want him to get
[1:56:01] whatever part he wants me to play I
[1:56:04] already have my portion I don't need a
[1:56:07] building don't need a monument don't
[1:56:09] need recognition I already have my
[1:56:12] portion now I want him to get out of my
[1:56:15] life what he
[1:56:16] desires oh how good the word is to
[1:56:19] encourage us to keep aligning our Focus
[1:56:21] to the right things to move us away from
[1:56:25] the Earthly into the heavenly vision
[1:56:27] like God did for brother brandham may he
[1:56:29] do the same for us today forget these
[1:56:31] things just look to him he's our
[1:56:35] portion man how many will pray for our
[1:56:37] brother Danny
