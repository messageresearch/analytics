TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is it possible that this whole book amen is a veiled mystery that unveils Christ but that I find that I'm part of the mystery amen and it unveils me and I find out amen every Spirit that's ever been alive is still alive Spirits don't die amen whatever Spirit they were fighting before they're fighting now and I'm fighting those same spirits and everything that has been is now but Solomon said there's nothing new Under the Sun but everything that has been is now amen man now I know what happened to the churches I know about the white horse rider I know about the red horse I know about the black I know about the pale I know all of these stuff the problem is we know it all but we don't know it because we keep falling under the influence of the horse riders and God has to continually come to our rescue I mean it's not like we've walked a glorious perfect life friends we we're born again receive the Holy Ghost we have the the message and we never made a misstep after that we've fallen into all kinds of self-deception I mean self-pity and all kinds of sad games and and stories and made mistakes and walked contrary and failed and what was it deception where was the deception the deception was right inside amen because there's two Nations yeah at War if I've conceived if this is God why is this so let's go inquire of the Lord and they'll say Hey listen here's the mystery yeah there's two peoples in you two Nations amen but I love how he says but the younger Shall Serve the Elder because for us the elder brother was the sin nature the one that come to expression first we were born in sin shape and iniquity amen the natural birth came first and we're born all the carnal side all the carnal things listen you don't have to teach your baby to steal you don't have to teach your baby to bite you don't have to teach your baby to lie I mean I don't want to upset you all of you are holding those sweet little babies but but they're born in sin shaped into iniquity amen they come into this world speaking lies amen they're Fallen creatures and you don't have to teach them any of the evil or any of the wicked they pick up on that super fast yeah we spend all of our time trying to keep them going the right way and me we get none of our time trying to teach them the wrong way but yet they always find the wrong way and not the right way and we're exhausting ourselves do we we get it so the elder brother the Esau came first amen but what comes second is the new birth amen the Jacob the Israel side comes second but he said in this prophecy that the Elder Shall Serve the younger amen there's going going to come a submission there's going to come a servant toe and by the grace of God according to the prophetic word of God that I know by the new birth and by the spirit of God that that old nature is going to have to serve the younger going to have to serve this new birth amen and I thank God for that and so now this this this elder brother if we should say this elder part of me it's going to have to come subjection and come into servant toe Amen to this new birth praise be to God
