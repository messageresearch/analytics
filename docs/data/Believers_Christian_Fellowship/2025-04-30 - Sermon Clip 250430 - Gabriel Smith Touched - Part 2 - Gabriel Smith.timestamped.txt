[0:00] Like no matter what somebody does to you
[0:03] wrong,
[0:05] the moment you lose that love for them,
[0:08] something's wrong.
[0:10] Amen. That's right. Amen.
[0:13] And I'm I'm not I I know cuz I've been
[0:16] there.
[0:19] And it's not easy.
[0:22] You know, we as human beings, we can
[0:24] only take so much punishment,
[0:27] right?
[0:28] Amen. And and sometimes life is a grind
[0:32] and and sometimes it gets real dark
[0:36] and and sometimes it gets so black you
[0:40] don't know which way to go. And I get
[0:43] it. I've been there. I know it. I know
[0:46] it well.
[0:48] But there is a place of relief.
[0:53] And and you don't have to stay there,
[0:57] but you have to make a choice.
[1:00] Regardless of how you feel, you have to
[1:04] confess God's word is right.
[1:06] Amen.
[1:07] No matter what I'm feeling, that's what
[1:10] the Bible says and that's exactly what I
[1:12] believe.
[1:13] There's so many times in my life,
[1:14] friends, I I knew I I've since I was a
[1:18] little boy, I always knew this message
[1:21] was right. And I spent decades of my
[1:23] life going, "That's right and I'm
[1:26] wrong."
[1:27] Amen.
[1:27] And I don't know how to get there. But I
[1:30] just kept confessing.
[1:33] I just kept confessing that Bible is
[1:35] right. This message is right. And by
[1:38] that confession, my body came into
[1:41] subjection to that word.
[1:45] But the moment we stop doing that, it
[1:48] takes honesty. It takes sincerity.
[1:53] It takes admitting we're wrong.
[1:57] Amen.
[1:58] And by doing that, it brings this old
[2:02] house of flesh subject to God's word.
[2:07] Praise God.
[2:08] Amen.
[2:09] And and and is it easy? Absolutely not.
[2:13] If it was, everybody would do it. Yes.
[2:16] But God is calling us to a higher level
[2:20] that we will we will be that invincible
[2:23] army. And it won't be uh AR-15s and buoy
[2:27] knives. It'll be it'll be this faithful
[2:30] little book that we'll be holding.
[2:33] Right. That's this right here is our
[2:36] protection. This right here is our
[2:38] artillery. This right here is our
[2:40] nuclear weapon.
