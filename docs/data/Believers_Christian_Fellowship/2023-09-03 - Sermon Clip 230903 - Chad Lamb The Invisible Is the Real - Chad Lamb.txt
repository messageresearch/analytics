========================================

so when we start talking about the thoughts of God Amen we've got to break out of the natural and move beyond the limitations of our mind and recognize a perfect mind that when he thought of himself it was a perfect thought it was an eternal thought he was thinking of himself amen what is the Eternal thought of God it's his eternal thought about himself how he will Express himself his attributes the fullness of him being expressed as a family God thought that before the foundation of the world and you were part of that thought because you were intended to be part of that expression so I know I mean when we start dealing with this we're dealing with things that are so far removed from the things we've known all of our life that only only faith is going to allow us to penetrate beyond our carnal mind beyond all of our experiences beyond the natural that we've been locked into and pierced beyond all of that and see that this is absolutely nothing but the truth and the only real real there is so I want to say the statement again thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real I want to make this other statement from the paragraph before the bride was already in his mind she was existing in his thoughts sometimes I we've had the tendency to almost downplay that like I was there before but not only in his thoughts is there anything more real than his thoughts is there any existence more real than his thoughts so don't say that was only in his thoughts say that was already in his thoughts that's where everything originated from that makes it more real than any other expression that is the real expression that's the genuine that's the first that's I hope you see what I'm saying we can't say well you know I existed before I was in heaven before I have representation in him well that was only as a thought my goodness you want anything more than that I mean only as a thought a genuine thought of God an attribute of God God thinking of himself God himself I was there real existing in his thoughts and you say a statement like only in his thinking only is thinking where else do you want to originate do you want to pop out somewhere else down the line no I want to originate right there and if I originate there no matter where I pop out down the line it goes right back to my original existence in the mind of God so you got to go so far beyond this carnal so far beyond the tangible so far beyond Realms and dimensions because Realms and dimensions were created to express God's thoughts I'm telling you this message is so deep no earthly man could have preached this but it's so simple it's not complicated but when you try to understand it by carnality it just doesn't add up because I only know matter space and time I only know here and there I only know now and then but there was a time that I knew before that and there's something inside of me that still knows what I knew before that
