[0:00] lot salvation
[0:02] didn't have to do with lot
[0:05] lot salvation had to do with abraham
[0:10] because of lot's affiliation with
[0:12] abraham
[0:13] god rescued him out of sodom before he
[0:15] destroyed it not because of lot's
[0:18] characteristics not because of lot's
[0:20] deeds amen because of lost association
[0:22] with abraham because the scripture said
[0:24] god remembered abraham and delivered lot
[0:29] he didn't remember a lot he remembered
[0:32] abraham and i asked you what kind of man
[0:35] is this amen what kind of human being is
[0:38] this that can speak to god amen as a
[0:42] friend amen who could talk to god and
[0:44] ask him 50 no if there's not 50 about 45
[0:47] how about 40 how about 30 oh don't be
[0:50] angry with me how about 20 oh i've
[0:52] spoken i'm being bold to speak again how
[0:54] about 10 who is this that can implore
[0:57] god who is this that means it's having
[0:59] an effect on god who is this that god is
[1:02] responding to who is this that god
[1:04] remembered amen one of his loved ones
[1:07] when he come to destroy a wicked city
[1:10] that lot chose to be in
[1:14] lot made his choice he knew
[1:16] that they were sinners exceedingly
[1:18] before he ever went there but when he
[1:20] had his choice where to go he went and
[1:22] pitched his tent towards sodom knowing
[1:24] that they were sinners exceedingly he
[1:26] chose his way he chose his path he went
[1:29] down into sodom amen but there was
[1:30] somebody living a separated life who was
[1:33] a predestinated elect seed of god who
[1:35] was concerned for a lot and when god
[1:37] would talk about the destruction he
[1:39] would say is there any way to save it
[1:41] would you save it for this many would
[1:42] you save it for that many amen and he
[1:44] god couldn't even find the tin to spare
[1:46] the city he had to destroy it anyways
[1:49] but god remembered abraham and when he
[1:52] remembered abraham he brought lot out
[1:57] what kind of man is this amen i tell you
[2:00] he's the same kind you are a man he's a
[2:02] son of god he's a predestinated elected
[2:05] seed of god amen who has a father who
[2:08] knows him and is in a relationship
[2:10] together where you can become concerned
[2:12] amen for your loved ones and ask god god
[2:15] would you spare them is there any way
[2:17] god would you spare them and god
[2:18] couldn't spare sodom he had to destroy
[2:21] it but he remembered abraham and brought
[2:24] lot out
[2:26] couldn't find 10
[2:28] but he could find the one abraham was
[2:30] concerned about
